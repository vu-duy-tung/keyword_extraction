We definitely plan to return for breakfast soon. Thank you so much for a great dinner and excellent service!",

Our server was abrupt, almost military-like, but she was on it with the service.  My man got the coconut French toast.  He liked the topping, but wished that it was made with thinner bread than the challah.  He also longed for real maple syrup (I have spoiled him).  I ordered the veggie omelet, hash browns and biscuit.  The biscuit was light and fluffy, and the omelet and hash browns were decent.  Hard to mess up eggs, but also difficult to make an omelet stand out.   I like the vintage styled memorabilia on the wall.  The booth where we sat featured \"I Love Lucy\" and the Rat Pack.  Motown played on the juke box, which added to the retro charm. At the end of our meal, our no nonsense server gave us a sweet, little smile.  That was nice.",

    "text": "Yesterday, I checked in at Midnight diner, and I am currently beginning my review as I sit at a booth in sleek, but old fashioned diner. As we entered, I was surprised at how big the place was. Everyone was extremely friendly, and we escorted directly to a booth. Despite the fact that we were we seated immediately, it took a while before someone came and took our drink orders.  When our was finally taken, it seemed as if it took a while for our food to arrive.  It can be a very frustrating feeling when you arrive at a locale before others and you see them get their food, finish their meal and pay before your own food ever arrives!  I was literally salivating in anticipation for our meal to arrive at our table.  Once it finally made it, my girlfriend and I immediately dug in.  My girlfriend ordered the chicken tenders w/fries and a side of collard greens.  She said the collard green were just okay... they were not seasoned with any kind of meat and were bland. She enjoyed the tenders, saying they were, \"moist and tender\".  I tasted the chicken tenders and can concur - they were excellent.  Some of the best tenders Ive had around Charlotte.  However, we both gave the fries a thumbs-down.  They weren't crisp or hot.  In fact they were the exact opposite - soft and room temperature.   I ordered the Midnight Special with my eggs being scrambled w/cheese, bacon, hash browns \"covered and smothered\", and I was allowed to substitute a pecan waffle for just $.50 more.  Everything was cooked to my liking.  The hash browns were PERFECT.  I thought the eggs were a little hard.  I prefer my scrambled eggs light and fluffy.   The best feature of Midnight Diner is its versatility.  You can go there early in the morning before work, for lunch, or late - after a night of carousing with friends.  In addition, they have any and everything you could possibly want to eat, and breakfast is served all day!   I felt like my experience at Midnight Diner was lessened by the service, because the food was above par.  Yes, our waitress was extremely cordial, but she was anything but prompt.  I went there looking to be in-and-out quickly and was greatly disappointed.   In closing, I've heard so much good stuff about this spot that I def want to go there again.  I'll just go when I've got a whole day to burn and I'll try to sit in a different section.",

It's described in the menu as a third pound burger. And for $9 you would expect it's gonna be a third pounder. And it was just a normal size hamburger. Like a 1.50 McDonald's sized hamburger.   Bottom line- if it's late night and other places are closed - this is a perfectly good place to eat. If it's 7pm, go to Hardys.",

Nothing about this place feels upscale, the crowd is a mix, it's always busy, the Shrimp & Grits is incredible. While Texas Pete is available and punches up the flavor, the creole sauce is robust enough to stand alone, the green peppers maintain a crunch of freshness, and the grits are smooth. Don't know if they can blacken the shrimp, but that would be a nice finish to this otherwise excellent plate the menu says is made to order. Five stars is based on this experience",

WOWWWW. The French toast was not super sweet like you'd expect, so syrup on top of those with the wings was perfection. I'm a big roscoes chicken and waffles fan and was worried this wouldn't meet my expectations lol. It was different but just as good. Also I've never had such buttery home fries in my life.

I was extremely happy there was a 24 hour diner in the neighborhood, but unfortunately this is not the case anymore.  This place has gone completely downhill since I moved to this city.  First and foremost, this place has attracted a lot of sketchy people in the recent years and has had its share of violence on occasion.  Aside from this, the food is poorly prepared in contrast to how it used to be, and the staff is nowhere near as friendly as my earlier experiences dining here. Last but not least, management is extremely unprofessional.  On my last visit the manager begins screaming at the top of her lungs saying \"this isn't uptown cabaret if you finished your food get the hell out of my restaurant!!\"  I understand they need to clear the space for new customers but this honestly made me feel extremely uncomfortable.  I've never even seen this kind of unprofessionalism in a restaurant before, not even in a Waffle House. If people are loitering in your restaurant, handle this properly like professional management should by going to each table to see who's already paid their bill....comon now!!!  The owners truly need to hire better management to clean this place up.  I give this place 2 stars just because it's open 24 hours.",

Sorry to say the food was not good: chicken soup was warm, not hot; grilled ham n cheese was cold enough that the cheese did not melt; sausage was overcooked and shriveled up; waffles were cold. On the other hand, chicken strips were good and the grits were tasty and hot. Overall, an underwhelming experience.",

Actually I'd give it a 4 stars for the breakfast (ate there a year ago and really loved the MIdnight Diner special).  Had the famed chicken and waffles, and while I'd give the chicken wings a definite 4-5 stars (so flavorful, so crispy, so moist!) I thought the waffle was \"meh\" and the side of broccoli I got (to be healthy) was also fine--plain steamed broccoli.  And the hash browns this time around were a bit soggy (a year go they were crisp and delicious--maybe the cook was off on this round).  My husband had the BLT and coffee and said it was good.  Cousin had the seasonal fruit--which was your basic melon/grapes/pineapple combo and the chicken soup (which she said was good but on the salty side).  I'm willing to give them another try--maybe they'll get another star next time.",

I heard cursing in at least one song and there was a family that had young children with them.  The chicken and waffles were pretty good. We'll probably go back again.",

While first walking in, it reminded me of Waffle House, however the environment was different and I don't believe it is a chain restaurant. My server for the morning was a woman named Dana, and she was very nice, respectful, helpful and patient (because the person I was with was ordering a large amount of food). She even helped him figure out how to get everything he wanted at the lowest price possible. He ordered some of the chicken wings they have on the menu, and they were some of the best looking chicken wings I have seen in my life. Plus they weren't baby wings, they were full large sized wings. I wanted to try them but sadly, I'm allergic to wheat. My food (hashbrowns and bacon) was good. I had already eaten prior to going to the restaurant, therefore I did not order much. My food was great though and so was service.",

With some friends in town this weekend, after a night of carousing, we were looking for a basic breakfast place and decided to walk down to Midnight Diner to check out the fare.  I have to say, I'm not as impressed/delighted with old-timey-style diners as maybe I'm supposed to be... they always seem a little too affected for my taste.  The good thing is that because of the family clientele Midnight Diner seems to attract (at least on a Sunday morning), it seemed like a relatively clean place; the bad thing is that it's kind of sterile.  That said, the breakfast food was good - standard breakfast food, but they didn't eff anything up.  The portions were gigantic and left us all feeling like little round butterballs that had to be rolled home through Southend.  My biggest contention?  Price.  This may look like an old school, old-timey diner from the outside, but when you look at their breakfast prices, you realize it's just another \"Uptown\" Charlotte, Super Charlotte People flytrap.  $9 for a basic breakfast combo?  Well, OK.  To each her own.",

So I decided to give it a try.   Even though it was late the restaurant was packed to capacity by people who were dining in and people who ordered to go. The restaurant is kind of small but it was clean and I was comfortable. This must be the spot after the club on Saturday nights. There was a sign on the door that said no weapons past this point which was different for me because I had never seen that before. They also had an armed police officer inside who was very friendly with the customers.  I ordered chicken wings and my daughter ordered shrimp and grits. I had to send my chicken back because they were not cooked hard enough for me. The waitress was extremely nice. She took my plate back without an attitude. It took a while for her to bring me another plate of wings but the second time the wings were cooked just right. I nibbled on my daughter's delicious shrimp and grits until my wings returned so I was just fine. But my daughter wasn't happy because I was eating all her food..oops.   Although everything tasted delicious and I prefer eating at the restaurant, I will be calling ahead next time to order my food to go.",

That one I did remember ;-) and I was sober so this is a LEGIT REVIEW!! I went with a party of 4 and around 9pm. We were seated right away, but beware- on weekends/late night/ Sunday mornings you will wait for a table.   I ordered the shrimp and grits and I thought they were awesome! Very good flavors. It was sweet (from the grits), but the sauce made it a tad spicy- just up my alley. There were about 8-10 shrimp in my dish so for the $12 this dish was a steal. When I return I will definitely order the shrimp and grits again. I've heard it's the token item here and they did not disappoint.",

Second time I had an eggs breakfast and the bacon was half cooked (no crunch), the eggs were unscrambled (egg chunks) the toast was not really toasted and only 2 pieces of the 4 had butter (very little). My friend had chicken & waffles and the chicken was not seasoned, the waffle was good but hey my 5yr old can make a waffle. The only thing that was good is the grits, so unless you're going for shrimp & grits save your money. This place does not live up to the hype AT ALL. Try Graham Street Grill up the street, it's not a dine-in place but the food is MUCH better & HALF the price plus they have REAL home fries. Breakfast will run you less then $5 which is more then either of my meals from here were worth.",

Ordered the chicken with biscuits, steak and eggs (wish I'd ordered it medium rare rather than well done) and the hot cakes platter( we were 4 people). It cost about $60 (including the tip). Once again I ordered iced tea, can't get enough of the stuff. It was the perfect breakfast. Our server, Greg was great. Actually the whole staff was. I highly recommend it, and believe me guys, I do not like every place I go to eat. I just write reviews for ones I actually would go to again. Also I got a (2nd) refill in a disposable cup for my iced tea...i mean COME ON. Yay!",

Ordered the Midnight Special - two eggs, choice of grits or hash browns, 4 different meats and 2 pancakes (subbed a waffle for $1$)  Pluses - Breakfast served all day. Service was good, not too much, not too little. Coffee served in large, heavy duty mug. Food (with the exception of the bacon) was cooked properly and served hot and relatively quickly.   Minuses - bacon was undercooked and rubbery. Waffle was good but unremarkable. No idea why there's a dollar surcharge to swap out. No sugar substitute on table. 50s music (while appreciated) was waaay too loud. The single $ rating is misleading. Kinda pricey. Can get the same meal with equal quality at a Waffle House for $5 less. For a short order motif, the broad \"no substitution\" policy is puzzling  Bottom line - if you're in the area, a decent place to dine. Will try the non-breakfast fare another day",

Last time I went they messed me up by putting the wrong cheese in my Greek omelet, but they quickly replaced it so it wasn't an issue.  There is limited parking on the side of the restaurant and a bigger lot in the rear. Although I have never gotten the chicken and waffles I do know that they serve REAL chicken wings with their waffles which is a plus in comparison to some other places.   I would go here more often for breakfast if it were closer to me. I have never had a problem with any staff. It's a diner so they don't exactly schmooze, they serve and keep it moving! I recommend trying his place for a quick casual meal!",

Yes there was a group of cop cars surrounding the place because some of the crowd had gotten into a fight and had taken it outside. But that doesn't reflect on the restaurant, the customers maybe. Anyway, I had two eggs over medium, hash browns and sausage with the afore mentioned biscuit. The hashbrowns were my least favorite, a little to greasy, and not really crisp enough, the eggs were cooked well, but the sausage stole the show. Link sausage might I add. Juicy, crisp outside, perfectly seasoned little links from heaven. I'm not a big meat lover, but I devoured all 3 links and dared the hubby to try to steal a piece. All in all, even with the somewhat rowdy crowd, I will be returning. My food was served quickly, the decor was cool and funky and the food was good. In need of a late night bite? Stop by the midnight diner, you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "So on a whim I went to Midnight Diner again since a friend was in town for the Holidays and we needed a bit of catching up. It was 10pm I was starving and am also dog-sitting so I didnt want to venture too far from home- off to the diner we went.  Our service was great- both friendly and prompt.   I ordered the Shrimp Platter $11.99 - a little pricey in my opinion but it came with fries, shrimp, and slaw.  Wow the shrimp was awesome- 5 stars for those! They were much bigger than I expected (sometimes you get the tiny ones at diners) and they were cooked just right.  The coleslaw was very fresh and homemade. They did not appear to use a mix so I really enjoyed that as well.   The fries were nothing amazing- but they weren't bad. They were standard- served hot- they are not super salty which is good and they had malt vinegar to put on them : ). They didnt give you a ton but they were heavy on the shrimp portion so I couldn't complain.   Overall I was really impressed - 4 1/2.  I think the price is the only reason for a non 5 star rating being that a diner is usually a bit cheaper but overall I would absolutely get them again!   They seem to be getting their act together in terms of actual quality of food- and that it something I can certainly appreciate.",

The good:  - Cool place, great look, wonderful authentic feel  - The story of the diner presented in the vestibule, very cool  - The location is awesome, and it has parking  - French fries are thick steak fries and tasted great   The Bad: Everything else.  - Service started with \"I just got triple sat so I'll do what I can\" and went down hill from there to \"this is why I hate when they run my food for me\".  - mac and cheese is baked style with congealed cheese. Probably good when first made but not when served. Ate like leftovers from church picnic  - Philly Cheese steak had hard bread, very greasy, wrapped in paper then cut and served. You are forced to remove this very sloppy paper in order to eat  - \"Smothered\" hash browns are hash browns with 2 slices of American Cheese put on plate and stuck in melter, the meal served on same blazing hot plate. The worst hash brown I have ever experienced  - Chili on Chili Dog very chili powder tasting with no other balancing flavors  - Burger comes in same wrapped paper. Not as sloppy as cheese steak, but still not a fun way to eat a burger   I will try this again only because I love diners and really want this place to be what it can be. We need a good diner in Charlotte. As of right now, we still don't have one. Maybe tomorrow.",

    "text": "After an early morning watching EPL at or favorite bar my girlfriend and I were looking for a late breakfast.  As we were near Uptown we though we'd give Midnight a second try, first for breakfast.  We were seated fairly quickly considering how busy things looked but it took quite a while for someone to come over to the table, perhaps 5-8 minutes.  After ordering a fairly basic breakfast it took what fellt like 15 minutes for out food to come out.  While our waitress was thoroughly apologetic for both waits she said it was because they were so busy.  I appreciate the effort but for a diner noon on a Saturday is prime time.  They might as well be short staffed at midnight on a Friday or Saturday.  Food was pretty good, but the burger I had on the previous visit brings down their average here.  Thin, dry and seemingly mostly made of filler and not hamburger.  Overall not a bad experience either time but nothing to keep me coming back either, there are better diner options in town if you're willing to make a small effort.",

    "text": "Although the food is good, I have to give them a BIG THUMBS DOWN!!  The reason for this is twofold......first of all, when you walk into the Restaurant, the first thing you see is a list of RULES!!  Really......the list includes such things as \"No Substitutions\" (You can't even get all white meat or all dark meat when you order Fried Chicken).  So if you want something on the Menu, you are forced to order it \"as is\" and then order something else, if you wanted to substitute.  The Rules also state that you can't order a \"Take Out Meal\", then decide that you want to eat it there, or in a case I actually saw, a lady ordered take out, but when she wanted to sit down and eat her food while she waited on her ride to pick her up, she was told she had to go outside to eat!!  By the way, did I mention it was extremely humid and in excess of 95 degrees?  This restaurant is not friendly to African-American patrons!!!  The list goes on.....there must be 8 or 10 items on the \"Rules List\"!  I have been in Restaurants all over the world, Five Star, Diners and Dives, and I have NEVER seen RULES posted all over the place the way this place has them!  I feel like I am in High School eating in the Cafeteria again!  I loved the food, but I don't think I will ever go back because of this.   Also, two of the Waitresses got into some sort of disagreement while I was there and it had to do with something outside and the parking lot.  But it got so bad, that someone called the police and this was late morning, so alcohol was not involved.  Also, Wi-Fi only worked on one side of the Restaurant, and according to a Waiter, its been that way for several months. What a shame.......this is just a poorly run Restaurant which happens to have a good cook/chef.",

    "text": "Oh blah Midnight Diner why you gotta be like this to me? At this rate I might as well go to Waffle House.  I stopped by here at 11 recently after watching a play in NoDa with my date. Since 11 was pretty early for the drunk hungry crowd we managed to get seated pretty fast and our waitress was charming if inattentive. I sadly stared at my empty water glass for half of the time I was there. So basically the same as usual. \"What made you lower your rating then Jimmy?\" you ask? Well my usual order is 2 eggs scrambled and tomato slices. Granted their tomato slices taste like tasteless slave tomatoes (yes that's an actual term, look it up!) but they don't exactly have many options that are friendly towards people who don't eat pork or much beef and just want a cheap quick late night munch. Well it's because when the check came and my bill was double what it usually was this time so I glanced down. Usually tomato slices are free, but apparently now they charge $2.00 for 3 all but tasteless tomato slices and this change wasn't listed anywhere on the menu? I think I might've understood like maybe 75 cents for them or something. You can go ahead and call me cheap, but I dare you to order some tomato slices when you go there and tell me they're even worth near $2.00!  Yeah so as much as it pains me to choose a chain over supporting a local business I think I'd much rather just go to WaHo, or even better Mattie's(please think about staying open 24 hours on weekends Mattie!). The prices and quality of food combined with shoddy service here don't really justify the convenience to me anymore.",

The chicken is so fluffy and tasty that I cannot resist one whenever I go.  Their other chicken will sucker punch Price's and put it in a cobra clutch.  I love the traditional breakfast menu and I am sucker for their pancakes as well.  This is definitely a great place to stop feeling hungover and start feeling fat.  Oh what a trade off!",

    "text": "Ah,....the Midnight Diner.  One of the only places open late all the time so that I can be a super fattie whenever I want.  Let's talk about the decor/environment first.        I've been here at all hours of the day and it's usually a standard mix of people (Obviously the Twenty-something Club crowd is here in the wee hours of the morning) and average \"Diner-ish\" decor.  What I mean by that is, your standard framed posters of music icons and bright red paint and shiny stainless steel.     Now the food,... it's delicious.  Their burgers are large, tasty and served with gigantic steak fries.  Their Breakfast may be the best selection that  they have.  I highly recommend \"The Bubba\" which is a huge plate of biscuits and gravy, 2 eggs and my choice of Hash browns and Bacon.  It's at kind of a steep price ringing in at 8 bucks but like I said, it's a huge plate of food.  Their bacon is great and while that seems as if it's not a great feat, trust me it is.  I'm kind of an aficionado.  Today I had a fried chicken breast with a Belgian waffle.  Their waffle had just the right amount of vanilla extract and it challenged me to order a second one.  On the other hand, the chicken was slightly underwhelming.  The breading was just breading that lacked any great amount of flavor and while the actual meat wasn't dry per se, it wasn't exceptionally juicy.  I felt that it was just as good as any fried chicken I've made at home and I'm not a fabulous cook by any means.       The Midnight Diner gets my vote for late night feasting and you can't go wrong with the breakfast!",

    "text": "I love a good diner! There are quintessential elements to a good diner that evoke that sense of nostalgia including vinyl bar stools, row of booths, open kitchen where you can see and hear food sizzling on the grill, delicious & cheap food, and bottomless cups of coffee. Add a friendly waitress that calls you Hon and you've got it all!  Diner food is  everyday comfort food and if it's done well then you're reminded of home. Well, Midnight Diner does it well! The outside of this diner is beautiful! There is Chrome Chrome and more Chrome! The inside of the diner is clean and visually stimulating with plenty of places to sit. You can sit at the counter in one of the vinyl stools or at one of the many booths.   They have a pretty extensive menu with so many good options. 9 pages of options to be exact! They even have a small selection of liquors and beer.  We ordered bacon, scrambled eggs, and toast with a side of fruit and the Shrimp and Grits. The first order was good but the star was the Shrimp and Grits. At the base of this dish are the creamiest grits that I have eaten in a long, long time! Like my Granny's! It's topped off with shrimp, pan sauteed vegetables, and a creamy homemade creole sauce.  The portion was ample and I was completely full by the time I was done. I needed a nap! This dish was delicious from the first to the last bite! Karla, our waitress, was attentive and really sweet!  The other staff were friendly and had a positive attitude despite having to work on Thanksgiving. I was a happy camper and plan on returning to this diner again!",

The atmosphere can be weird after 12:00 am but all the drunk people in Charlotte who need food are there after parties :)) Also in the middle of the day it's good to have place which offers pancake and eggs. Very authentic diner and I love here for what it is.",

This is one of those places where if you can't find something you like here, well the problem is probably you. Their fried chicken is delicious (heads up: it does take a little longer, worth the wait). Marinated overnight, hand breaded- get it over a Belgium waffle or French Toast. Shrimp and grits (their most popular dish) is also really good. Burgers, BLT (huge), wings- you can't really go wrong with anything.   The place is not huge, so there's often a wait during peak times. They do have a full bar with beer (including local selections) and liquor. Music is always really great. I found myself dancing in my booth today while chowing down on a grilled cheese and green beans.  They are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Warning: if you go here late night, just be careful. There have been a few incidents of crime, violence outside of the diner.",

I order pancakes, with eggs, bacon, and grits. All Of the food is average except for the grits. However tonight the grits were just okay.

Who is in the kitchen cooking the wings? They were horrible barely seasoned or even darken. I sent my plate back. Next I ordered the Philly cheesesteak sandwich and fries. This wasn't a winner either. Everyone raves about this place but I must have come on a bad day. Metro Diners fried chicken is far better. I still paid for 3 total meals even though I wasn't satisfied with either. They need to do better. Season your chicken! I spent $70 including tip and still left hungry. It's not about the money it's about the quality. Not sure if we will be back! I usually give a place a second chance but the food needs to get better!",

Our waitress was warm and friendly and the other waitresses and waiters chatted us up too.   I don't know if it was all of the chatting and laughing but our food came out in a flash. Everything was hot and delicious. Now anyone can cook an egg but perfectly executed grits and French toast are hard to find.   The french toast was crisp on the outside and fluffy inside with the right balance of egg and milk and cinnamon. The grits were creamy at the cheese was already melting when they arrived which means they were hot and fresh.   The price wasn't bad for all of the food we ordered $13.77 for my half.  As always, Midnight didn't disappoint. Wish I made it here more often. Can't wait to come back.",

We ate here maybe once a week before we fell victim to a waiter writing in a tip.  I would say that is the only thing about our horrid experience, but it is not.  Once we got to the diner we experienced waiters coughing in their hands serving food and not to mention our waiter decided to pick food directly from our plate.  I ordered the Midnight Special(which I always got with bacon), but it hit our table with sausage.  I told the waiter I asked for bacon, and he decided to ask me to give the sausage back.  That was not the problem, but the problem was that he had me hand him the sausage off of my plate with a napkin. Now...where was the sausage going?  Was he taking the sausage back to take to someone else's plate?  We still ate because we have faith in Midnight Diner.  Now we love ordering chicken wings at the diner, but this day...they were so unappealing.  The feathers were literally still on the chicken to the point, I had thought they flew to our plate.  We never got a refill and then when my boyfriend asked for a to-go cup....it never appeared.   Oh, but that did not stop our waiter from WRITING IN A TIP! HORRIBLE SERVICE. We usualy tip 20 percent if the service just normal, but this was well below average. We are still waiting on the diner to \"consult with their financial advisor\".  THIS IS FRAUD. If Midnight diner does not respect their customers' hard earned money then how can we expect them to respect our bodies?? Til this day, my boyfriend has not recieved his money in return....Where is the trust?  It is most def not at the \"famous\" Midnight Diner.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!",

Expect a wait if coming to the diner late on a weekend night or around lunchtime on a weekend day. It is not uncommon for the line to be outside and down the block.  The diner has a small parking lot, but a lot of the patrons walk to the diner. The food is typical diner food, and it's reasonably priced. If you are looking for greasy diner food and you don't mind waiting, this is your spot!

My three year old's meal was not even half way finished & my meal was about half way. When the server saw us come back she said thought we left. They politely sat us at a different table and said they would remake our meals, however I told them I didn't want them to remake mine but my daughter was still hungry so hers could be remade. Well it took an additional 30 - 40 minutes to get our new food, and when I got the check they only took off half the price of my sandwich because I had eaten half prior to them taking it. Personally, I found this to be extremely unprofessional, and not customer friendly.",

Midnight diner has great, southern inspired dishes and classic 50s diner atmosphere. Be ready to wait a little because this place is popular!  My favorite thing to get is the Bubba: an open faced biscuit with scrambled eggs, cheese, and sausage gravy on top. It comes with your choice of meat and hash browns, grits or fruit. Wowee- definitely allow time for a nap after this meal!  The chicken and waffles are also delicious and a staple at the Midnight Diner.

    "text": "Was looking for something to eat after a hanging out downtown Charlotte late one Saturday night.  We arrived around 130am and had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated.    This diner offered more variety than your typical Waffle House.  Friend and I shared the chicken and waffles, and chicken strips which came with fries.  The waffle wasn't good, it was too airy... the chicken wasn't fresh.  The chicken tenders and fries were actually tasty and seasoned well.  The ranch was fresh made and was also tasty.  The sweet tea was good, not too sweet and wasn't watered down.  There was nice R&B music playing that night, which added a nice twist to the dining experience.  We left around 230 and there had to be 50 parties in line waiting to be seated.  There were also several police offices present to ensure things remained orderly.",

It was busy the night we visited but was seated in about 7 minutes.  Looking through the menu... I wasn't sure what I wanted but after checking Yelp and suggestions, a lot of people said Shrimp and Grit, which I asked the waiter on her suggestion and she also recommended it.  Yelp and the waitress definitely did not disappoint me, this was the BEST SHRIMP AND GRIT I have had in a LONG TIME.  Super flavorful and added some eggs on the side with my meal!  TRY IT!",

They're so juicy and are served steaming hot each time! I recently discovered that if you get them off the appetizer menu, you get a generous 5 tenders and a small serving of fries for super cheap - perfect portion, perfect price. Not to mention the peach-colored sauce that comes with it (smells/tastes like a mix of mayo and hot sauce) is bomb. If you're looking for a cheap late-night meal with friends and don't mind waiting out the guaranteed line, this is the spot to go!",

SO, I ordered the death by chocolate cake and IT was delicious. It was then I vowed to make a point to go back to Charlotte just to eat a regular meal at the Midnight Diner. The atmosphere is so funkified 50's and the energy is just rockin'!   PS. I could hardly believe how reasonable (to even low) their prices were. The energy was just so amazingly good vibed.

The bacon was excellent.  The pancakes were thick and fluffy.  There was so much food I couldn't eat it all. Dad complained about paying extra for tomatoes, but he's from a small place in Indiana and doesn't understand city life.  Lol",

Typically someone scribbles closed on a white piece of paper and tapes it to the door. More recently there was no sign, staff just inside doing whatever, get to the register and I'm told they're closed. Since there is a lack of 24 hour eateries here in Charlotte I'd really like to see consistency when it comes to operating hours. Otherwise when I am able to get food, I'm a fan of the grits, fried chicken, and French toast.",

There were so many ghetto drunk people on the Friday night it was appauling how some people behaved. I was thankful for the heavy police presence.   I had shrimp and grits both times and both times it was the tastiest thing you could find to eat at midnight. There service is good for how many people they have to deal with. The tables and booths were clean and despite all the drunkies, the bathroom was surprisingly clean. I gave 3.5 stars because nothing else open at midnight has food as good as the grits here.",

I know, I know but I'm still gonna eat it and I'm still gonna not read the package because I still don't wanna know exactly WHAT livermush is lol.   Midnight Diner is always poppin. It's open 24-hours and they have a great menu so people are literally in here 24-hours a day. I'm a huge breakfast/brunch fan so the fact I can get it anytime here is a big plus! I always had great customer service and it's always been clean. They even have a jukebox! Today the sanitation score is a 93 (idk what that's about but um...) The only reason I'm giving 4-stars instead of 5 is because subsequently since they're so popular there is almost always a wait and parking is limited.  Seriously if you haven't eaten at Midnight Diner you are missing it!",

Parking can be an issue with a paid lot behind with a few free spaces but free on tge weekend. Ask or go ahead and pay at other times.  If you want a meal at a diner, this is the place.",

Their grits are outstanding, or as one of my friends once said, \" ...made by God\". Super creamy grits y'all. Then there is the rest of the extensive menu. There's nothing more disappointing for me than going somewhere for brunch and the menu is so limited or too bougie . If the brunch is bougie it BETTER be GOOD. Being a diner, Midnight has something for every meal and is VERY casual. Other favorite menu items of mine here are the Challah French Toast and the shrimp and grits. Very few places do shrimp and grits the way I like ( sans any chunk or piece of pork in it) but I think Midnight Diner does a good job with theirs; it's a little on the spicy side, but still tasty.",

And looked soooo good. We sat and ate for about 30-45 minutes. Food was just as good as I remember. Bill came out to be $33 for two people before tip. Good price for what you get.

This also comes with a delicious home made biscuit.  Oh man... I had to stop myself from eating that biscuit after taking a couple of bites.  I'm glad I did because that fried chicken was one of the best I've ever had.  It was light and crispy and juicy and tender.  I could go on but then those onion rings were absolutely delicious too.  My fried food feast was so absolutely enjoyable.  And my waffle craving still has not been quenched so.. next time.    Service was good and friendly.  Our server never let our cups go beneath half.

We headed to Midnight Diner and were hesitant based on the line we saw, but decided to take the chance anyway. The pine moved quickly and this was a Saturday night around midnight. We were seated after 15 minutes. I ordered fried chicken tenders and fries, along with a glass of champagne because apparently fried chicken and champagne were made for each other. I enjoyed the tenders but they needed a sauce. Perfectly fried but no seasoning on the breading. The fries were mediocre. My friends both got chicken and waffles and they didn't feel like they chicken was cooked enough. It didn't look appetizing from my view. I'd def come back here and try their shrimp and grits. They also have an amazing assortment of cheesecake but $8 was just too high for my brokenness that night.",

Midnight Diner never disappoints, the portions are large. My go to is either the shrimp and grits or the pecan waffle. The shrimp and grits is full of flavor and comes with a biscuit on the side. The pecan waffle has crushed pecans mixed into the batter with warm syrup. You can also ask for the honey butter for the top of it. This is a popular place so you should be prepared to wait. It is open 24 hours so keep that in mind for people just getting there after a night out or church is out on a Sunday. The vestibule is very small so at times you have to wait outside. During the warmer and better weather that shouldn't be much of an issue. I'm not sure what they do when there's inclement weather FYI.",

Been a good while since we've dined at Midnight Diner and it was time for a revisit.  Dropped the sample off at 8:30 am and were here about 10 minutes later. Parking on the side was limited but did manage to score the last spot. My wife and I walked in and everyone was very helpful. I have upcoming hip replacement surgery so I'm using a cane but everyone jumped up and held doors for me while I navigated to a table. Very much appreciated.  Expansive menu with something for everyone including my wife who normally does not like breakfast.  I ordered the Western Omelet, Hash Browns and Whole Wheat Toast and all of this was made from scratch.  My wife had two eggs, over easy, Turkey Sausage, Toast and a Side of Fruit.  Everything was perfect The Omelet was very good, the Hash Browns were some of the best one's I've had lately.  Seems like most places are going to preformed Hash Browns from a Food Service provider but not here. These were the real thing.  Wife enjoyed her's as well and she confessed she occasionally enjoyed diner food.  Service was great and our Coffee Cups were never empty  Only thing I did not like and the restaurant had no control on that was that our table was next to an expanse of glass and it was 15 Degrees F outside so it was a bit on the chilly side.  Otherwise, great visit.",

    "text": "My picture serves this establishment no justice BUT LET ME TELL YOU !!! This food was soo soo soo good ! It was about 2am after the bar my friends & I decided to stop pass here & when we first came in we were taken by. Surprise . The doors inside are blocked off by yellow crime scene tape & a sign on the second set of doors that tells you to wait there until a waiter assist you . Beside the waiters on the inside of this slam packed restaurant were about 3 police officers kind of alarming but I still wanted to try the food .   The wait wasn't too long because we beat the rest of the crowd leaving the bars & clubs . Once we were seated we let our waitress know we had one more coming to our party of 3 who was maybe 8 mins down the road . She says ok , takes our drink order n walks away .. maybe 2 mins later she comes back with the drinks and asks are we ready & we are not because they have a huge menu & also we're waiting for our friend . ( this is the reason they lost the last star ) the waitress then says \"y'all need to leave the table and wait back outside in the waiting area because I could be making money off this table instead of waiting on you all \" I just stare in disbelief becauSe we hadn't even been sitting at the table for 10 complete mins .  Luckily our friend showed up two mins later , she placed our order & has the nerve to say nothing personal I'm just all about my money ... ma'am that's not how you earn a tip I felt like that was beyond rude . But whatever I ordered a side of hash-browns & fries chicken wings super good ! All the seasonings were just on point I didn't have to drown my chicken in hot sauce it was great . If our waitress hadn't been as rude as she was this place would have gotten a fourth star",

She came over as soon we sat down, took our drink orders and offered her thoughts on what was good. Our food came so fast and was so good I was shocked. We did little talking once our food arrived because it was that good. If you do go here and there is a line just know it's worth the wait. YES IT WAS GREAT!

For what were supposed to be never frozen hand breaded chicken tenders on my wife's salad they did a remarkable job of looking and tasting like something frozen from Sysco.  The A/C seemed like it was being piped in from the 7th circle of hell, the waitress didn't know the menu, didn't seem concerned that my wife only ate 3 bites of her food and instead of asking if something was wrong just offered a box, etc... The decor is cool but that's about the only positive thing I can say. We won't be going back.",

There are photos of the haul in the entryway. I was taken a back when I saw it nestled just outside of uptown Charlotte! What a great decision.  Apparently a great spot for post-bar hopping. As with any diner, you have the old fashioned decor and jukebox in the corner. The food is good, not great. The staff is good, not great. But it is usually a mad house when I frequent at 3am. There is usually a line at the front as any local will tell you. When you're tired and wore out from dancing your ass off at the bar, you come here for replenishment and good conversation. Then to bed you go ;)",

Since leaving Boston in September I've been trying all sorts of new places in Charlotte and this came to mind first.  It's an old style silver on the outside huge booths on the inside kind of place.  It is good for two things - hungover breakfast and I just left the bar and I'm starving! kind of meals.   For breakfast I always get the omelette with avocado and cheddar and hash browns.  My husband always gets grits which I think are gross but he loves them so they must be good.  I've also had the fried chicken and a burger there.  The fried chicken is good and the burger is just ok.  The service is great and everyone is so nice.  The sweet tea (which I've become an expert at since being here) is too sweet, you gotta cut it with water or you'll go into sugar shock.  All in all not a place to check out, especially when it's only a 2 minute walk from your apartment -  kids in Camden South End...this means you!",

Food: unpredictable, but overall bad Atmosphere: cute decor, poison air Service: spotty, either decent or never again  I wanted to like this place so much. I drove past it every day as it was being built and was intrigued by the large, shiny box. Once it opened, I was extremely excited to give it a try. I mean, it was built to be a diner. It had to be good. Alas, I went a dozen+ times thinking that I had had bad experiences because it just needed time to settle. After all, it's new, it probably has to work out the kinks. I've finally decided that's not True.   We had one waitress who was amazing. A mature lady with witty humor, people skills, and a peppy attitude.The best kind of server you never find. However, most of the servers are below average and a select few are the worst I've had. Ever. Now, what can save a place with terrible service? Amazing eats. No such thing here. The breakfast choices are okay. Lunch is okay. Dinner is okay. The food is not horrible but it certainly isn't great. Nothing tastes fresh. It all just tastes okay.   And okay food does not make up for service this terrible. If you sit within hearing distance of the kitchen or bar, you'll hear servers yelling or making nasty remarks and their hatred for each other fills the air with tension.    Overall, I'm not willing to endure a hostile environment, terrible service, and sub-par food for cheap prices and a convenient location. I'll go to Mattie's Diner for great food, great service, and a pleasant environment and sacrifice my driving minutes instead.",

Midnight diners' shrimp and grit are what I imagined SNG should taste like and more. They have the solution!",

    "text": "First let me say, the food and service was great! Sunday, November 28 2018 was my very first time at the Midnight Diner. After flying from to Charlotte, I met my sister-in-law at the diner for food and fellowship. We had a great breakfast and excellent service. After eating, my sister-in-law placed a to go order for her family. As we were about to leave, my husband texted me and ask that I bring some food home for \"tasting.\" There's no tasting as I had five adults to feed. I placed two orders of the coconut french toast, chicken tenders, cheeseburger, stack of french toast with a side of hash browns. Five boxes were in a box, so I assumed I had all of my food. When I arrived home (an hour and a half away), I noticed my daughters french toast stack and hash browns were missing. I immediately started calling the restaurant. I called several times and never got any response. I called the next day (11/19/18) and was told anytime the food leaves the promises they are not responsible for missing food. I spent over $110 in total. My sister-in-law spent close to $20. If they ask the waitstaff that worked on Sunday, they can vouch for my story as we tipped the very attentive waiter very nicely. For each to go order, my sister-in-law gave him a $2 bill tip. All in all, I would go back and eat, but the policy on not being offered an apology or a rain check on the missing order is absurd. My warning, check your to go orders for accuracy prior to leaving the premises. Do not call on Sunday (during their peak hours) as the phone doesn't get answered.",

They have a full menu and carry a full bar of adult beverages. On this trip to the diner, we had the chicken and waffles and shrimp and grits. The chicken and waffles come with 2 or 3 wings and additional pieces can be purchased alacart. The shrimp and grits are probably the best in Charlotte and very delicious. The chicken and waffles is also very good but the best thing about this restaurant is the service. The servers are very nice, inviting and always accommodating. The only reason eye I can give this place is the parking. The free parking is very is very limited but there is a abundance of paid parking. It's great place and I do plan on returning.",

I went to this location on ACC weekend 12/2/17. Parking was non-existent. I could have chosen to leave but I actually double parked and waited for someone to leave. Success! I was seated immediately once I entered. I came in with brunch in mind, but when I heard the table next to me ordering \"collard greens\" I quickly shifted plans. I ordered the 1/4 White Chicken Dinner with 2 sides and a biscuit. (Macaroni & Cheese, and collards). While passing the desert case I saw 1 single piece of Chocolate-Chocolate Cahke and ordered it to go on the spot. The food is EXCELLENT. if you're not careful you just might accidentally bite your fingers. I'll definitely return and can't wait to sample breakfast!",

I ordered the fish dinner which wasn't impressive but was just ok. I ended up eating my wife's other half of her Philly cheese steak later that night and it was delicious! My friends got chicken wings and waffles and said they were excellent.

So I went in as I pulled up  the line was out the door so I thought if the lines out the door the food must be great so I took the time and waited in line to be seated, finally when I was seated I got the menu from Amber who was the waitress and place my order, I ordered Cornedbeef Hash ,poached eggs and and toast.  While waiting for our food i always familiarize myself with the waitress so we can have great communication.  So after Amber dropped our drinks on the floor and had to replace them , But as i for my food i received my eggs in a bowl with water still in it and toast cold and no butter .smh Unbelievable I WILL NEVER GO BACK HERE . i called to speak to manager never got one and i wish i could contact the owner.  They went to far ro say if i didnt have another form of payment since my chip didnt work they would have to get the officer outside , when i already informed them my chip was malfunctioning due to constant use and it happens to tons of people especially a person like me who travels. If i didnt have another family/ friend who had cash i wonder how far it would of went because i actually went in initially by myself and she played as if she was getting the officer absolutely horrible experience, to ad insult to it employees took smoke after order was taken and seem to be a norm . Not a good representation at all. I wish i could give a negative but i trust my review to handle that .",

I didn't have any syrup on the table for my pancakes and I was also missing hash-browns. I waited for my server for about 5 minutes. Then my boyfriend walked to the bar to ask for the items I was missing and no one even came up to him to ask if he needed anything. Finally my server came around and told us she'd get my hash browns right out and brought me syrup and hot sauce. I was then charged extra for the hashbrown until I brought it to her attention that I never received my order that was supposed to come with my plate. She took them off but she seemed irritated and like I was asking her to do to much. The star rating is solely on the food... the service we received is a -1.",

The service was fast paced and fun, with friendly faces serving our ultimately disappointing milkshakes. Overall, we had a great experience here and I hope to head back for chocolate shakes.

The chicken was undercooked and lacked a good crust, if it is what you like. I've had 10x better chicken and waffles. And really ~6.99 for a chicken breast!!! No. Just no.",

It was crazy chaotic inside and we were ignored for a good bit before we got seated. The food was not the best, even for diner food.

I ordered take out on Thursday night and it was ready in about 15 minutes. I got the Firecracker Shrimp salad and I'm kind OBSESSED now. First off, that bread! Whoa, topped with shredded cheese then under neath all the ooze is garlic/honey flavor. You will want to eat both pieces right away.The portion was generous and full of veggies. The creamy Parmesan dressing goes perfectly with the spicy breaded shrimp.  I also took a few, ok numerous bites of the bacon ranch wrap and mini burger sliders. Both were great, but the sliders....oh I could have ate both of them! Grilled onions, cheese and pickles. That's all you need. Ohh, and that secret sauce! Delicious! The buns are baked in house and they had a sweetness about them. I loved their seasoned fries. I need to try the shrimp and grits next!   I'll be back soon!",

If you're trying to call in an order --- you'll really have to get lucky and be dedicated. There are times where it won't go through, times where it'll ring and ring and nobody answers, and other times where you'll be put on hold only to get hung up on 3 minutes later. This is the one area that Midnight Diner realllllly needs to improve upon.  Breakfast --  Chicken & Waffles are good. Not the best you'll ever have, but definitely worth an order if you're craving chicken for bfast. My absolute go-to breakfast order is their shrimp 'n grits. The sauce is juuuuust spicy enough to have a kick, but still easily enjoyable. And the biscuit that comes with it?!?! Double up, buttercup.   Salads -- If you're feeling a salad, you will not regret ordering either the Picnic & the Firecracker Shrimp. Both of these are some of my favorite salads to order from a restaurant. not the healthiest you could go, but hey, you're comprimising and eating lettuce, right? And they come with garlic bread.   Wraps -- The firecracker chicken or cool ranch wrap are crowd pleasers.",

This little diner is quiet small on the inside so wait times can be lengthy (20-45+ minutes) on peak times (Sunday Brunch particularly).   There is a large variety of options on the menu to satisfy any mood you are in. Breakfast is served all day and all night (thank you lord). They also have your typical diner food (burgers, fries, shakes etc). I stick with my normal brunch plate: eggs, grits, and potatoes. It never disappoints.   Rating 4 stars only because it can sometimes be dirty with the high volume of traffic in such a small place. The wait time is also tough on a hangover (out of their control but still a struggle).",

You can also order alcohol here which is kind of cool.   The parking situation sucks, plain and simple. Not enough spots and the only other option is to pay in the lot behind the diner...$7 for 12 hours, plus maneuvering around that lot is actually pretty stressful with the tight quarters.

The grits were creamy, shrimp was tender, and the creole sauce was perfectly spicy.  I wish the service was at the same level their food is. I honestly wanted to order a dessert however I was annoyed and exhausted trying to get our waitress' attention. Between flagging someone down to get us drinks, for a refill we (4 of us) had to put our cups to the edge of the table along with all of our dirty platters. We at that point asked for the check right away. Great food. Terrible service.  Really terrible service.",

After being sat and refused to change my order by our server, Ashley - we then received beyond mediocre service.  Feeling somewhat stereotyped into the mold of \"black people don't tip\". Luckily a server by the name of Larry a.k.a \"Showtime\" managed to salvage what remained of an otherwise horrible experience. He definitely exempified the prototype of what anyone would call excellent service. Needless to say our server received no tip. Hopefully she learns something from her peers. Definitely will be back...and requesting \"Showtime\" as our server for the duration of his tenure there.",

Finally, after a morning work errand with one of my employees, I suggested I would treat her for breakfast at her choice of places.  She chose Midnight Diner because she said it was simply-the best for breakfast.  She was right.  We had our coffees and juices on the table minutes after we arrived and I ordered the biscuits and sausage gravy with eggs and was in biscuit and gravy heaven as I sampled my first bite.  I could understand why this place had a line at 2am for drunk people who wanted a greasy and all-amazing breakfast. I was enjoying it in an all-sober state at 9 am.  The portions were massive so I couldn't finish mine, but boy..... I was happy as a clam leaving there.  Best breakfast award goes to The midnight diner!!!!",

I was recently in Charlotte this past weekend, so I met up with a friend for brunch on sunday. We were able to sit at the bar immediately so that was a plus because there was about a 20 minute wait for a booth. I got the fish and grits (My fave) with a side of hash browns, and one egg. It took maybe 15 minutes for everything to come out. The food was simply amazing, fish was seasoned and fried perfectly. The grits were PERFECT, so perfect that I did not need to add anything to them. Our waitress was a little slow with responding, but I understand she was pretty busy. All in all I HIGHLY suggest anyone in the Charlotte area try this place at least once!",

Very close to the stadium, so expect it to be filled with fans wearing their Black, Blue and Silver on game days. Booths and a few tables inside.  Traditional diner menu with burgers and eggs and things. I did see other people with waffles and wings, but it was actually breakfast time when I was here. I chose to go with the \"Uptown\" which is two eggs and hash browns with a waffle. Eggs were cooked perfectly, the hash browns were both crunchy and soft. The waffle, however, was beyond desciption. Crispy on the outside, flully inside, it was still nice and hot to melt the butter and it soaked up the hot syrup. Excellent flavor.  Service was great. My waitress refilled my coffee often and cleared plates as I emptied them.  Free wifi, though no power outlets that I could see.",

During my last visit, I enjoyed breakfast pancakes, bacon, eggs and coffee. My pancakes had pumpkin added (real pumpkin not the flavoring) and they were huge and amazing culinary treats.

My ds(7) & dd(9) had the pancakes and enjoyed them but how can you go wrong with pancakes if you are in the mood.

    "text": "As I grew up in PA, these types of diners were everywhere - the metal outside, the round counter seats, and booths lining the outside wall of the building.  When you had a group of 5 or more, you knew you had to split up into more than one group as large tables were scarce.  This diner has all of that but they have corner round tables that fit larger groups.  The diner itself is actually larger than some of the other ones I've been to, including another local one, Mattie's.  Service here is what I would expect to find at something like this.  Exceptional when they are not busy but I would imagine it could get pretty chaotic in here at busier times but it's something you just accept from the atmosphere.  The menu is broad and you can get anything at anytime of day.  Breakfast at 4pm, check!  Well actually I was working an early shift at work and got off at 10am and treated myself to breakfast.  I ordered what I typically get for breakfast, an omelette, hashbrowns and a pancake. The omelette was their San Bernadino omelette which came with pico de gallo, sliced avocado and cheddar cheese.  The pancake was huge and dense and quickly absorbed the syrup I put on it.   It was good but not great.  Same with the omelette but the food was nothing to write home about.  I didn't expect it to be.  I came here for the experience.  One downside is I thought their prices were a little high for a diner.  I can get a better omelette, better pancake and better hashbrowns at a place on the other side of Dilworth for cheaper.    But everyone needs to realize when they come here, you come for the atmosphere and to get a decent meal.  It's not a 4-star restaurant and in my book, it shouldn't be. But it is still worth coming to at any time of day!",

A friend of mine orderd food to go from this place and I had a few bites of her fried chicken and I was really impressed with the flavor and texture that I decided to order a plate to go.  My plate was really disappointing, my fries were room temperature and my fried chickens coating wasn't all the way browned, it was that yellow color before it's full cooked, it was soggy and greasy as if it wasn't cooked on a high enough temperature or something and the flavor tasted like cooking oil. Surprisingly the chicken was cooked all the way through but the coating was not.  Didn't really matter though because it tasted so bad I couldn't eat much of it. Not sure if I'll try again.",

Once food received asked for manager who basically said waiter lied and ticket was lost so only gave a $4 discount for our whole party. Waiters and other staff came over and advised that manager lied and ticket was lost. Service aside what manager puts blame on everyone else!!!! Will not be going back unless management changes.

This wouldn't be an issue if other tables that sat down after us didn't get their food before us. Our waiter stated it was because there were 5 of us and due to us ordering grits and sausage as sides our wait would be longer. My food was forgotten and while my family finished eating I still hadn't received my food. This shouldn't be the case because other tables were receiving the same food. Overall the food was okay.",

They sat us around the corner and out of sight  and promptly forgot about us. After a while I made a fuss and got a server to take our order ..... but he never came back....  .... and much later, almost an hour after we walked in the manager himself brought us our food.

Being from out of town, I am always down to try regional foods.  Both the grits and biscuit were amazing!    Fast forward for dinner tonight.  4 in my party ordered firecracker chicken sandwich, buffalo chicken sandwich both of which were good.  My brother said the firecracker was not really spicy as you would expect from the name.   Mom got shrimp and grits.  Wonderful!  I got a half fried chicken since my brother couldn't decide what to eat.  I figured might as well get the extra chicken for only $3 more for him.  I ate the white,  he ate the dark.  Sooooo juicy and hot.  Omg, the best.  We were going to go to Prices the other day, but they were closed for Christmas week.   No worries, the chicken here exceeded expectations!  Came with a biscuit and two sides. I ordered the mac and cheese and by recommendation from our server, the collard greens.  Both of which were great.  The collards were a better than the mac and cheese.    And such a fun, happy place!  Everyone was in a great mood.",

The food is your standard diner fare but the atmosphere is what gives this place its charm, especially if this is a late night stop for you. If you come here right after bars close, expect to stand in line for 20-30 mins, more if you have a group larger than 2-3.   Food is not bad but there is always something going on at the diner. When I went last time, there was some scuffle that occured on the outside. Usually it is just how drunk people are but being from the south it was somewhat entertaining to watch.

I learned about this gem from a faculty member in my doctoral program. She told me she heard good things about this place and wanted to check it out. After talking to her, I naturally went on Yelp and looked at the reviews and pictures. Needless to say, my interest was peaked and I went that same night. There was no wait when I arrived and the hostess showed some southern hospitality. I'm not used to that up in Pa. I ordered the dark meat fried chicken dinner with two sides and an extra thigh (call me greedy). My sides were mac n cheese and collard greens. It also came with a biscuit. The food was so good, I had to eat it slow just so it wouldn't go away as fast. No...the food was so good I tried to come back for breakfast two days later. But I was in a rush and there was a 20 minute wait, so I was unable to indulge. Yes I was very heartbroken. Instead of pancakes, I had a Greek sandwich somewhere else.

They are open 24 hours which makes it that much better plus the fact that the whole menu is always available. After 10/11p just about any day of the week it's usually a line to get in and after club hours it's even longer. Every time I've been it's always packed with not a single empty table open and once one becomes open it's quickly cleaned and taken. My go to items to order are the shrimp & grits or the 3 chicken wings & French toast. Both are really good. I've even just stopped by to get a bowl of grits, they are so good. FYI if you love Flying Biscuits grits they are the exact same!!  The waffles are usually a hit or miss, this last time they were very dry. With there menu being so huge there's definitely something for everyone.",

I think some dishes and CONSIDERABLY better than others.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were a bit hesitant to come here for brunch because we saw the huge group of people waiting outside. However, we ended up giving it a try, and it was fantastic. The estimated wait time for us was 30 minutes, but we probably only waited for 20 minutes. The diner decor is on point, but the floor and the bathroom could use improvement.   I ordered one of the favorites, Shrimp and Grits. The menu has a bunch of items that are highlighted to indicate popular items. In theory, these are items that should grab your attention because they are highlighted, but my mind chose to skip over them. I was looking through the entire menu, flipping back and forth, trying to find the popular shrimp and grits, and I was looking at the correct section, but my eyes constantly skipped over the yellow sections! I felt so silly when I asked the waiter where I could find the shrimp and grits on the menu, and he pointed right on the page that I had open, exactly in the section that I kept looking at! The Shrimp and Grits ($11.99) was delicious. It is creamy with a mild spiciness to it. I had a piece of shrimp in almost every bite, which is something I always hope for. I was very satisfied with the portion. Also, the meal comes with a biscuit.  Boyfriend had Corn Beef Hash Slam (corn beef hash with 2 eggs any style and buttermilk biscuit or toast for $7.99). He added an extra egg for an additional $1.25, which I think is absolutely ridiculous. You could buy a dozen eggs for that price! His dish was not anything special. The corn beef hash and eggs were cooked just a little too long.  Our waiter was friendly. It was very busy, so he did forget to give us something to stir our coffee (we did not have silverware at the time), and the bill took a very long time to arrive. However, he did apologize for the lack in service, and he did provide us with coffee to go. The coffee ($2.19) tasted too diluted, but we are thankful to have coffee to go.",

And friendly people are what makes it fun to come back.  Our last visit was to console the latest Panthers loss to the Seahawks. Fortunately this place serves beer, which is pretty awesome! We sat down at the bar and had some fun discussions with the waitress who was working and the people around us. The menu is very large and they have something for everyone,  but personal favorites include the bubba (biscuits and gravy on steriods) and the pecan waffle (dare I say it) may be better than waffle house.   Overall a fun place to check out and I'm glad they went through the effort of relocating this diner car all the way to Charlotte!",

I've never had a bad experience here at all.   I brought my mom here and she thought it was going to be an \"upscale\" restaurant. I said mom, some of the best food comes from small diners like this... don't hate. She enjoyed the shrimp 'n grits as well. Its very filling and will leave you smiling.

I ordered my bacon limp, bacon comes out in less than 2 minutes not limp. No way was it cooked fresh.   They kindly fixed me some fresh bacon.  Waitress was great! Restuarant was clean.

For parking, there is a small parking lot in the front but you can also park in the rear area. I was told that we went at a good time (Saturday around 4pm) because if we waited longer, we would have had to wait. Everyone also says that this place is POPPIN' right after the club let's out especially since it is 24 hours. It's a great place to people watch.  You can tell that the waitresses were hustlers. They made sure they claimed their table and also made sure that you were helped. I ordered the Shrimp and grits and yes. YES. YES. .. y - e - s. Everything was cooked to perfection. My boyfriend got a philly cheese steak and he said it was good. He also ordered mac and cheese and also another side of fries. The fries were \"basic\" and not really special, but they were good.  Shay, our waitress took great care of us also. She made sure that our glasses were full.   Bathrooms were clean and it was appreciated. The floors were also clean around the restaurant.

In my opinion these are some of the best fried chicken wings Charlotte has to offer (Price's Chicken Coop is my number one for plain fried chicken wings in Charlotte). I also enjoy their omelets and their hashbrowns (Pro Tip: You've got to get the hasbrowns with onions, cheese and ham. Trust me!!!). Their pancakes are solid but I'm not the biggest fan of their waffles and french toast. The only major downside is the wait on the weekends. You could be in line for up to an hour or two trying to get a table. This place gets my vote for best late night food in Charlotte (Sadly Charlotte does not have a ton of late night food offerings outside of fast food. As the population here grows, I'm sure that will change).",

There is plenty of parking on the side and a cool neon sign.  When I walked through the door, I was immediately greeted by my disappointment at unmet expectations. The floor and windows were dirty, the white walls severe and abrasive, and the bathrooms horrendous. We almost left after seeing the bathrooms but instead alerted management and decided to stay.  I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit and my boyfriend ordered two eggs, bacon, well-done hashbrowns and white toast. I ordered half of a grapefruit but the waitress returned and said they were out of grapefruit. While the food was brought out expediently and made to our satisfaction, there was nothing special or memorable that could make up for the failed interior.   Midnight Diner is open 24 hours/day, and obviously caters to those late-night cravings. But trust me, your drunkenly made scrambled eggs or mac-n-cheese, enjoyed in the comfort of your home are the better option.",

I went on a Saturday well after midnight so naturally it was packed. But here's a tip: call ahead and order. Full disclosure though, you may have to call 2 or 3 times to get through but oh so worth it. Once you've placed your order over the phone you're able to \"skip\" the line to go pay for your food at the register. Easy peasy. The cashier was very nice and even personally delivered my food to me once it was ready. The officer who was monitoring was nice too. It was very packed but it's good cheap food so go figure.",

My friend and I stopped in after a very long day at work upon my brother's recommendation. Even after midnight on a Sunday night (actually Monday morning) the place was packed. Boisterous diners of all shapes & sizes were busy celebrating LIFE and FOOD!   We were seated promptly and quickly greeted by possibly the BEST SERVER EVER!! Jaya (sp?) was quick, sincere, knowledgeable, and a genuine pleasure to be around. We asked about the Shrimp & Grits and Chicken & Waffles, and she confidently recommended BOTH. I ordered the S&G, my friend ordered the C&W. Jaya suggested that the waffles were good, but not that special. She then recommended the Chicken & French Toast.   In short order, our food was brought to us, and NOTHING was a disappointment. Maybe the Shrimp could have been bigger, but they gave me 8 instead of the advertised 6, so I was just fine with that.   Yes, it was awesome. The S&G was spicy enough to start a fire, but gentle enough to savor every bite, the undeniable warm, fluffy goodness of the buttermilk biscuit puts Bojangle's to absolute shame, the C&FT was so good it should be illegal and the atmosphere was thick with electric, deep-fried, southern goodness. Stop what you're doing, and go to Midnight Diner NOW!",

    "text": "Tonight was my second visit and most likely my last. Don't get me wrong. I'm not going to begin bashing this establishment.  The first visit was okay. I had Steak & Eggs, with Grits and Toast. The grits were suggested by one of Charlotte's Finest 'CMPD', whom also informed me that the owner also owns the Topless Nightclub next door and another restaurant at the Epicenter, downtown. Immediately I could tell that the grits 'though good' were cut with either heavy cream or real butter. I was close, because it was sour cream. Final note for breakfast: Good, but I've had better. This evening and on my second and possibly my final visit, I ordered fried chicken, with two sides. It was priced at $9.99, with a substitution surcharge, for getting a leg in place of the wing, as part of the all white 1/4 chicken plate. I learned of the heavy surcharge when I went to pay. The plate costed an extra $3.22, bringing the net amount to $13.21, plus tax. I could have gotten the wing, then added the leg for possibly less the cost of $3.22.  Nonetheless, it wasn't the servers fault for how the manager on duty handled the situation. I still tipped the server $5+, for fried chicken that could have been much better, if the fryer's temperature was set at a minimum of 350 degrees. The chicken was extremely oily. The breading was good, however the meat within was bland.",

My friend and I both had The Bubba which was a beautiful combination of eggs, biscuit and gravy (I got my gravy on the side), hash browns and bacon. I enjoyed every single bite. I'm sure you're wondering \"why only three stars?\"  Well, the place was pretty empty given that we went on a Tuesday morning, they're open 24/7 so understandably they were doing some cleaning while the place was empty. One of the gentlemen was moving some booths, cleaning around the seats and whatnot and announced out loud there was vomit under one of the seats close by our table. Now, I can't say I'm surprised given that many people probably visit after a night out when they need greasy diner food, but did I want to know this at 7am while I was enjoying my breakfast... NO. Thinking about it now makes me gag a little. Plus I find it disgusting that they just now discovered it.",

The fried chicken...gives the Chicken Coop a run for their money. Anyone from Charlotte (and transports) knows what that means. Well worth the 18 minute wait. I'm still trying to figure out what's in those darn grits!!!!!! They are so creamy. The food is simple and delicious. If there's any kind of event going on in Charlotte *cough cough...CIAA*, expect a long wait to get in the door! You won't be disappointed. SN: They also have a little food cart behind the Uptown Cabaret!",

First, we stood on a Saturday night for more than 45 minutes while they refused to seat anyone due to short staff in the kitchen (though several people were allowed to skip the line altogether and walk right in to be served, go figure). They then passed out cards to go to another diner in the Epicenter. Giving them another chance due to their close proximity to my work, I called in an order for pick up only to arrive to find no one ever put it in. This last chance I just attempted to call in an order and was told I needed to call in closer to the time of pick up. Im done.",

Pros: -On a cold, busy night, we were sat within 15 min. -It was clean. Even with all the people there, they turned over tables quickly and everything looked good, even the restroom. -2 of us split a chicken and waffle meal and they gave us no trouble adding a wing. (Nor did they charge us a \"share\" fee). The chicken and waffle meal was EXCELLENT. -The sweet tea was excellent, but that's to be expected in the South. -The total bill for 5 people (4 meals) was only $40.  Cons: -The \"host\" (a big man at the front door yelling to guests) was not friendly. Very aggressive and not attentive. I know it was busy but still, he could have been nicer. -The waitress(es) (because we were served by about 3 of them) were ok. They were not overly friendly or accommodating. They were average. One of the ones that served us told us that she wasn't our server when we asked for more napkins. :-/  Overall, I'd go back to enjoy the food on a less busy night if I'm in town again. However, I'd hope that the service was better.",

The biscuit tasted like it was previously frozen and had a hint of plastic. Eggs were pretty rubbery. Hashbrowns were pretty good. My husband got a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for $4.99, assuming it came with fries as the menu seemed to indicate that all the sandwiches came with fries, but alas no. It was $5 for a pb&j with no fries. Really?  The service was ok. Our server just brought our food and never came back but fortunately another server did refill our drinks.",

My sister promised me that the Midnight Diner served the best coffee in town. The coffee lived up to it's hype. It was amazing.   I would have rated my visit higher but some of the staff members were absolutely RUDE-not to me but another patron. Apparently there had been some confusion with a call in order. When the patron came back due to the error, two of the waitresses, Lisa and Dana spent more time arguing with the patron than trying to rectify the issue . I found them to be abrasive and condescending.  I felt sorry for the patron and I wanted walkover and yell \"just fix it\". Watching the exchange was very uncomfortable and these ladies clearly need customer service training. Sometimes it's not about who's right but about just doing the right thing!",

    "text": "It's not high art, it's functional food and it's an option. I went during dinner at 6:30. I had a minimal wait and was seated at a booth by the jukebox whose selections I forgot to peruse. Some other yelper please address.  The booths are comfortable and wide, enough for the two 240lb male consultants behind me or maybe three 120lb uptown clubbing women. I mention the clubgoer set because by and large I think that's where the patrons are going to come from for this establishment. What Charlotte has greatly lacked is a place making more substantive meals than bar food after 10pm between Uptown and South End/Dilworth.  The menu is as varied as you would want with a 24 hour diner. In terms of the breakdown of choices it's 50% breakfast, 30% lunch, 15% entrees, 5% dessert. I'd like if the low calorie choices were more interesting than iceberg lettuce + cottage cheese + protein on top. Iceberg lettuce is nutritionally bankrupt & except for a iceberg/blue cheese/bacon wedge it's not a salad base.  My order of steak & eggs came quickly and to order meaning the steak was as rare as legally allowed. This brings me to my opening statement as to what to expect. It is functional food served here, not haute cuisine. The eggs were a shade runney, which I prefer, the steak cooked well but could have used some rub and the hashbrowns definitely needed something. These are individual nitpickings as there was salt & pepper on the table and the waitress asked if I wanted steak sauce. The one gripe I have is the biscuit. It's more of a bread dough consistency than a Flying Biscuit/Zada Jane/traditional dough. It comes buttered so the flavor is there but the mouth feel is more spongey than flakey. It's not bad, it's just different.  Th service is warm & friendly without being hovering.  Parking will be an issue as there 8 spots. Carson St stop on the Lynx is a short walk away and I expect to see a number of cabs dropping off late night patrons.  Dear Charlotte, if your durnk if firmly on and you're not in the mood for another street side hotdog you now have another option.",

A big plate of home fries, eggs, bacon, and two great big flapjacks!  I am glad I was sharing.  The ambiance is pretty nice with the colorful and there was a nice crowd in the diner at around 1:30 pm.  All of the plates I saw coming out were piled high - good to know if you're hungry.  However, as with all diners in this area, the menus are not as varied as they are in the North but this one is definitely worth a trip to receive the Northern diner feel.",

The service was very good.  We went at like 930 at night it wasn't line out the door busy yet.  when we left it was. Now the meal oh my goodness.. PHENOMENAL ONION RINGS which I thought were the best in the city but my friend told me they werent even the best in the city. I'll do a review for that place in a minute. The fried chickens was absolutely the best fried chicken I had every had, it was crispy outside and cooked perfect inside.  The Mac and Cheese reminded me of my mom's mac and cheese awesome, broccoli was well cooked, cole slaw was out of this world and the banana pudding of my goodness,, words dont' do it any justice.  Run to this place get there quickly before the crowds barrage the front door. Great Great place",

Ordered and the food came out.....  typical diner food - nothing too too special that caught my eye, but good late night food at that.

Also ordered a side of hash browns with ham on top and were not disappointed. They were flavorful and the portion size generous. Nice strong coffee, just right sweet tea with friendly service.

I believe it was late Friday night, right around 10:30PM. So we were there before the club/party people... however it was still full, but we were seated quickly. Our server was friendly, but my water glass stayed empty.  First off... so are you saying I can get breakfast at 10:30PM?!? YES. I'm already inclined to like this place! I had the Midnight Special: Eggs, sausage, grits and pancakes. The do something different to their grits.. those things are super rich and creamy. I'm a grits fan, but I could only eat but so much of them. The pancakes were kind of thick... but they didn't get soggy as fast as IHOPs so that was a plus.   Sister ordered the shrimp and grits and she LOVED it. I'm not a shrimp and grits fan, but I tasted... and tasty it was lol. And my sisters friend ordered steak with eggs and hashbrowns I believe. She said the steak was tender, but it wasn't really seasoned, so the A1 sauce was a must. She comes here often, and was raving about the chicken and waffles.... something to try next time.  This place is definitely a late-night joint and would definitely hit the spot for me simply because I love breakfast at night.",

You speak to the Manager about it and they are so lackadaisical. So only thing I could do is not spend my money there. So I didnt eat there for a Year. Even when my friends wanted to go, I would decline and sometimes we would choose another place or I would just go home.  My wife wanted the grits really bad today so I got POSTMATES to pick up the order for me. Yeah, it was wrong...AGAIN. Missing my bowl of Grits (main reason we ordered) and I ordered 2 midnight specials and only received the eggs and bacon for one of them. So All i got for my meal is the pancakes! what makes is worse is the POSTMATES guy was like \"man.....they are kinda rude and rushy..\" He showed me the receipt and the receipt is CORRECT.  I called spoke to \"Reba\" who said she was the manager on duty. Might as well had spoke to a street sign. Had to repeat myself multiple times and she seemed annoyed.   I will not be going there ANYMORE and I have already secured the contact information for the owner. I will be writing him directly. I am a business owner and i think its important for him to know that though his business seems successful on paper because people come back for the food, they probably could be doing 10xs better if the service was better.

Overall the experience was fantastic and one of the best parts was the upbeat attitude of the whole staff. They generally seemed to be having a good time and Bonnie did an excellent job taking care of us. Definitely would recommend Midnight Diner.",

The selection of breakfast, lunch, and dinner is to die for. if you try going here after the club lets out you might just die of hunger waiting to be seated....lol It is a diner though so don't expect them to move for Uptown to Pineville into an enormous building, this is not a China Buffet. I will say that it is larger than most Diner's that i visited up North. I have been here at least 5 times or more and still haven't made it off of the breakfast menu, when I here Diner I just think breakfast. I give them 5 Stars so you know what that means, they have free WiFi and Great Food. I always get a different waitress, but they all are so nice and great at what they do.   ENJOY!!!",

First, being close to Uptown, let me say that I'm SO glad they have very close parking for customers.    Our server, Rachael, was fantastic.  She's what every server should aspire to.  She was friendly, perky, attentive, and genuine.  I hope she never loses that optimism.    One of the lunch specials was Shrimp and Grits with a creamy Cajun sauce.  Rachael recommended it, but my partner was already contemplating it.  That sealed the deal.  He ordered that and I went with the Black & Blue Burger.  I tasted the Shrimp and Grits.  It was SO delicious and full of flavor.  The creamy Cajun sauce was a great addition.  I should have ordered it.  The Black and Blue Burger was just okay.  Maybe it needed more seasoning and blue cheese dressing in addition to the chunks of blue cheese.  Of course, being a bit redder/pinker inside would have been nice, too.  Unfortunately, you can't get that in NC (Boo!).  The fries accompanying it (with a side of ranch that I requested) were delicious, though.    And you can't beat the prices or clean, shiny atmosphere at Midnight Diner.  They're two for two in my book!",

With that said, the chicken was fried to crispy perfection and was succulent and oily, just the way I like it. The sides were luke warm though and just unpleasant to eat.   I guess it's a good place to go if you're watching your blood pressure. Me, I need some more salt and spices!",

I definitely had doubts because its one of those places thats open 24/7 and a lotttt of people come here after a looong night out which is what I did the first time I went to Midnight Diner and it was delicious! But then the other day I got take out for Sunday morning breakfast and it was just as good! So sober or after a night of drinking, midnight diner is a must!   Both times I got a grilled cheese with cheddar cheese and french fries, yummy! And a really large portion for only 6 dollars! My boyfriend got chicken and waffles the first time which was great also. And the second time he got the midnight breakfast special i think it was called. 10 dollars for eggs, pancakes, hash browns, sausage, and cheesy grits! Sooo much food, good food, for really cheap! We also got a side of macaroni and cheese which is probably in the top 3 mac and cheeses I have had since I moved to Charlotte!   Just know, that if you plan to dine in, you are definitely going to wait whether its late night or breakfast time, there is always a line at the door. Trust me, the wait is worth it! I cant wait to go back and get another grilled cheese and try some new items on the menu!",

It feels like it's ALWAYS crowded, the space itself is not the biggest so I guess that's to be expected. The staff is almost always friendly (you can't win them all), the pricing is excellent and it being 24/7 is the BEST perk!

Tasty strong coffee.  The rest of my family had burgers, and fried chicken. Overall, very tasty food at fair prices. I'd I lived in Charlotte, I would be here very often.",

I love this place it can get packed after midnight they serve alcohol at the bar but every one is really there for  the food. I mean I seriously wrote dinners and drive in about this place because the grits are so damn good I want to know the recipe.

It's best to go before 2, because that's when the clubs close and there will definitely be a line out the door! I have been several times, but the most recent was so funny! We were sat (almost immediately) - just 2 of us. And the waitress - I cannot remember her name - welcomed us with open arms! She got our drink order and we needed a few minutes (well I knew what I wanted, but he didn't) to order.  I got the eggs, grits and bacon with a side of toast. Eggs over hard. I don't know if that's on the menu, but that's what I wanted (and I think she made it work). Everything was delicious! The grits are hands down my favorite - add a little cheese and I'm in heaven!! I ate everything and I was so full! My fiance wanted the chicken and waffles (and she suggested to get French toast instead) so he did. He said it was way better with the French toast and he will always order it that way!! There was a larger group - about 7- that came in after us. They were definitely a little buzzed but they were great entertainment! They sang along to every song that played and they were cracking jokes.  I will definitely be back when my 2 am hunger kicks in!",

I really liked the feel of the diner, very retro and the records on the walls were cool.   But when it comes down to it, people go to restaurants to eat. And honestly, the food to me was mediocre. I got the uptown which included a waffle, 2 eggs poached and hashbrowns. My husband got a tall stack of chocolate chip pancakes and an egg and cheese on a biscuit and 2 scrambled eggs. I also ordered a coffee. The presentation of the food was really unappealing to me. It did was kind of just thrown on the plate. My waffle was good, I liked that the syrup was nice and hot and I asked for the honey butter as well. I really despised the taste of my hashbrowns. They were too hard and there was a weird aftertaste. Overall, you do get your money's worth. The price is actually pretty great for what you get and the service is good.   Other food looked better. Something I saw frequently ordered was the shrimp and grits. For breakfast, the french toast or omlette looked the best. It does not hurt to try. I may come back for dinner one day.",

I ordered with my stomach rather than my brain and got the following items: chocolate milk, grilled cheese (with tomato) which comes with a side of fries already, and a side order of hashed browns w/ cheese + onions. Our waiter asked me if I wanted to sub my fries for the hashbrowns, and I was like \"nahh, it's okay\". Boy, I should have said yes. When our food arrived, I took one look at it, and I was like holy crap what did i do.   There was so MUCH food. I finished 3/4 of my grilled cheese, 1/2 of my hash browns, and 1/2 of my fries. And I felt soooo guilty since I hate wasting food. However, service was super quick, and our waiter was so nice. Limited menu for vegetarians, however, there are still some options available.

My mom's favorite dish is the shrimp and grits, so I had to go with mom's recommendation despite not being a huge fan of grits. OH MY, WORDY! Well, that changed instantly with the first bite. The grits, the shrimp, even the side biscuit were the bomb dot com! Let's talk about that biscuit for just a quick moment. Do you see the small pool of melted butter puddled atop the perfectly browned upper crust? If not, go back and look, it's there, and it is delicious! The biscuit was thick, doughy, but also flakey. Now, I don't know how to articulate grits nearly as well as that biscuit, but I can write how savory, creamy, and amazing they felt in my mouth. The smooth texture slid down my throat like a southern jazz fest. Since I feel like this review is taking a somewhat sexual turn, I'm just going to stop now. If you want to find out what I'm talking about, then go to the Midnight Diner in Charlotte, North Carolina.",

    "text": "We went on the 4th of July after watching the fireworks at BB&T Stadium based on the reviews. When we arrived the line was out the door and down the sidewalk!  We waited 10-15 minutes before being ushered to a booth. Our drink order was taken quickly by a friendly waitress and were given plenty of time to review the menu.   Several customers were having the shrimp and grits and others had the chicken and waffles. My hubs opted for the shrimp and grits, I had the Denver omelette and our daughter had the pancakes and sausage. The pancakes are REALLY good!! He liked his food and the omelette was filled with ingredients.  The food came out pretty quickly considering every seat in the place was occupied. We were surprised to see they even had a bar with premium liquors.   This is a place we'd visit again the next time we're in town.",

    "text": "WOWOWOWOW. The reviews did NOT lie-this place was incredible. We walked here from downtown Charlotte on a lovely Sunday morning and it was only a sweet 15-minute stroll.  When we got there we were seated right away but there was definitely a long line on our way out-so get there early!  Our waitress was so friendly and clearly had a deep knowledge of the enormous menu. There were 5 of us so we got a pretty varied group of breakfast foods, including the bubba, shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles and cornbeef. We're a pretty chatty group but as soon as the food came out we went silent from awe and stuffing our faces haha While everything was delicious, the top two were definitely the shrimp and grits and Bubba--the grits in particular are amaaaaaaaaaazing absolutely get them. The shrimp and grits was sooo flavorful and spicy! The shrimp were perfectly cooked and the added veggies were colorful compliments. The Bubba was a huge mix of sausage gravy, biscuits and eggs-it was truly enough for two people. The sausage gravy was also so good-truly old school farmer breakfast filling and the biscuits were soft buttery goodness. I dream about this place on the weekends and may drive the 2 hours for it one Sunday ;)",

There were cops monitoring the line since it can get pretty crazy. Once we sat, everything was so quick. We just went with the basic pancakes, bacon, eggs and hashbrowns. Our waitress was super nice and attentive. I would highly recommend to anyone who wants some good diner food. This place is definitely worth the wait!",

    "text": "Was in town for a layover with friends and one of them who lives in the area suggested Midnight Diner. Went in at around 10:45 am on a Saturday morning. There was a wait to sit inside so we decided to sit outside. The weather was perfect. Our server Sandrell was such a pleasant lady. She greeted us and took our drinks out in no time and then she put our mains in. We had the chicken and waffles, the San Bernardino omelette and shrimp and grits and eggs and waffles. Everyone was satisfied with their meals. At first when I tasted the omelette Is was underwhelming but after adding hot sauce it was a game changer. The hash browns were crispy on the outside just the way I liked it. The shrimp and grits were FIRE! Probably the best shrimp and grits I have had and I've had a great amount of shrimps and grits from different places. The biscuits served here was so soft and yummy. Even after getting cold they were still soft. All the servers here are very pleasant. Service was great, prices are fair for what you get and the energy is great. I highly recommend for quick brunch.",

Other good things on the menu you can't go wrong with- firecracker shrimp/chicken, shrimp & grits, corned beef hash breakfast, and chicken wings.",

    "text": "He Said:  I'm sorry, did you say \"Liver mush\"?  Yes, please!  If you were to read our breakfast reviews you'd notice a common theme: we are always on the lookout for a great breakfast spot when we visit a city and if there is scrapple or corned beef hash on the menu then we're definitely showing up.  They have corned beef hash, but the liver mush was the True draw for me.  Not disappointed!  It was a healthy-sized slab served with wonderfully crispy hash browns, two eggs that were nearly perfectly runny, and fantastic rye toast.  I had a side of corned beef hash, because I have to, and that was a little disappointing--particularly since it wasn't delivered until I had finished the rest of the meal.  I was pretty close to telling our waiter to forget it, but he was hard to track down.  Also, I think the corned beef is canned. A deal-breaker?  No way!    The coffee was good, the vibe was diner-classic, the staff was friendly, though perhaps a bit stretched, and the prices are just right.  I am sure we will be back.  She Said: Eggs Benedict wasn't an option at Midnight Diner, so I decided on a breakfast sandwich. I got it on a biscuit--eggs scrambled, bacon, and with cheddar cheese. It was tasty enough, but the side of hash browns was the best part of my breakfast. They were perfectly crispy and delicious. Our waiter was very nice--if a bit distracted by the many patrons. The diner was definitely busy, but the food is good, the space is fun, and I'd say it was worth the wait.   Potty Points: 3 out of 5 potty points. There wasn't a wait, and it served its purpose--but it's an odd space, that's for sure.",

Unless there are characters & hooligans that are overly intoxicated holding them up.  To note, Law Enforcement presence is heavy.   The kitchen can't accommodate food allergies & preferences so sticking with the basics aka 'Sides' is the smart way to go. For the Southern Food Fans, I saw heaping plates of Shrimp/Grits & Chicken/Waffles.   For the late night diner aspect this concept works.",

I used to order the Chicken and French Toast (made with delicious thick cut Challah bread, YUM!) with a side of collards (Awesome, when cooked right) or mac and cheese (DELICIOUS!) but now I get the shrimp and grits (BEST THING ON THE MENU!!!!). Even the Grits by themselves is amazing! Best grits in town! If you're hungry after a night of partying this is the place to go. I must mention that some days the collards are a hit, some days are a miss.   I also suggest getting there before 1:30 am or after 4 am otherwise you'll be standing in line for a table and if you want to pick food up it has to be called in before hand.",

I've been hearing 2 things from everyone: Chicken & Waffles and Shrimp & Grits.   Let me just say their menu is quite extensive to suffice for any meal of the day. The glistening metallic hub always caught my eye when I drove through the city and every time, it was bustling with people. I got to try both the Chicken & Waffles and Shrimp & Grits and both did NOT disappoint. I also got a side of hashbrowns. Everything that was supposed to be crispy, was crispy! The chicken was straight out the fryer and brimming with its juices once you take a bite. My biggest regret was forgetting to ask for hot sauce for my chicken. My hashbrowns were a little too oily on the bottom which I didn't particularly enjoy, but the top layer was nice and crispy.   Service was exceptional and our waitress told us she was sleepy. However, she never let that get in the way of giving us superior service. Also, I really appreciate the parking lot because that saved a lot of time and money.",

But to me, the absolute best item on the menu was the grits. They were the most creamy grits I've ever eaten. I got them to put cheddar in my grits. They were delicious. Next time I'm there, I will definitely get grits again. The menu has a very large selection of food. I really enjoyed dining there.",

    "text": "While their food is quite filling anytime of the day; the staff could be more efficient and accurate. I agree with one of the reviews here, I've been here 5 times and every single time I go(all evenings-around 9pm-2am), there is a number of staff taking smoke break right outside of the restaurant. I don't like breaking through a barrier of smoke just to go to the entrance nor do I like having the smell cling from such a short encounter. Sometimes the host is nowhere to be found so the servers just sweeps you off your feet to their section when eyed upon.   DON'T EVEN think about doing carry out orders either, it's never accurate and when you try to see if your order is correct by opening your to-go boxes by checkout, you get a slap down saying that \"you don't need to check it, I made sure everything is in there.\" BALLS. I've had spaghetti without the house salad it is suppose to come with, no dressings, no sausage...the side items never made it either. They have a pretty clear sign that once you step out with your order, they are not responsible for missing items. CAN A SISTER PHYSICALLY CHECK IF HER ORDER IS RIGHT BEFORE SHE PAYS? WITHOUT NO FALSE ASSURANCE?   While I'm done with being bitter, I would love to thank the wonderful cooks and chefs. You guys make my tummy happy.  Their fried chicken is crispy and just right. French toast is enough to explode your abdomen on half orders. Tea is southern sweet. Grits are wonderfully buttery and creamy. Make sure when you order a breakfast sandwich, check if it's biscuit or sandwich bread. We were bummed when we got bread. Shrimp and grits, spaghetti hits the spot if you're \"hangry\". Can't pledge for the burgers since it's been dry(patty) and bland the last two times I've tried it.    If you're ever hungry late at night, try midnight diner. It's a miss or hit on the menu but give it a try. Some of the servers are to adore but some could use a good pair of boots up their donk.",

I ordered the chicken and waffles while my colleague ordered the burger. When her burger arrived with onions, she asked me to switch plates. Even though my taste buds were set for a sweet and salty combo, I was just as pleased with the burger and home cut fries. I will definitely return.",

I had been craving a waffle all day and was disappointed with the waffle here, as it was really nothing better than what I could make at home with a waffle iron.  Also, the menu stated that it was supposed to come with whipped butter, and it did not.  I had to use the little packets of imitation butter and it just wasn't the same.  The corned beef hash, on the other hand, was excellent.  My husband had fried chicken, which was also excellent.  Service was adequate, but again, nothing to write home about.  They seemed to have about ten servers walking around looking frantic... somehow overstaffed but at the same time not delivering good service.  It was strange.  I will be back, however.  I want to try to desserts and something other than the waffle.",

I love the firecracker shrimp salad, warm delicious shrimp tossed in firecracker sauce and put on a bed of sexy lettuce...(didn't know lettuce could be sexy did you?).  I've also had an omelette here, fries, grilled cheese, carrot cake. I haven't had anything I didn't like. My friends have tried the chicken and waffles, and even french toast and chicken (upon request), chili cheese-fries, hot dogs, and the Mexican burger YUM.  The crowd here gets interesting, so keep a look out for some good people watching moments. We love when we get a fun waiter/waitress to like Lissssssaaa, which is exactly what her name tags reads.  Try out Midnight diner for your next late nite, or after hours get together, or morning after a good time Uptown!",

    "text": "Back when I used to drink like a fish, I ended up here at the end of the night or early the next afternoon many times. In a drunken stupor or in the early stages of a hangover, I want the grease cure and anything that is bad for me. The food is probably fit for consumption sober as well.  This is a comfort food zone & its best to put all thoughts of counting calories out of your pretty little head & replace them with thoughts of chicken and waffles. Yes, just like everyone else who has eaten here, I've had the chicken & waffles.  This is THE meal to sop up a night's debauchery & it's just awesome all around. I'm a waffle purist and don't go for all that fruit and circuses on a waffle. Why mess with perfection? I mean if it ain't broke, don't fix it. But if you want all that shit on your waffle, they have it. Gotta be making stuff complicated.   A huge Belgian waffle with a side of 3 fried crispy chicken wings.  The waffle is light yet slightly firm(as it should be). Nothing worse than a waffle that is as soft and floppy as a pancake. If I wanted a pancake, I'd get a pancake. Lookin at you free breakfast at Hampton Inn.  If that doesn't sound good to you, then I don't know what to tell you. Get a salad? Find a place with linens & pay too much? One of those two.  The fried chicken could be some of the best in Charlotte. Once upon a time, some friends & I split a whole fried chicken meal in the wee hours of the morning with friends. After spending too much at the bars, it works out perfectly divided 4 ways since we are cheap & broke at that point. Chicken quartered, fresh and fried, always hot & never greasy. Food here doesn't sit under some heat lamp for 15 minuted before making it to your table. What's up with places like that? Bring it already.  Served with two sides, the mac & cheese is superior. And it was served with made from scratch biscuits.  All the other diner favorites are available. Deli sandwiches, omelettes, grits, etc. But weren't you listening?! Just get the chicken & waffles.",

I didn't come here for the award winning coffee.  It's a good place to stop by to grab a quick breakfast that is decently prepared.  The morning crowd is drastically different than the late night crowd; it is comprised mostly of professionals on their way to work.  The service is much better early in the morning.  You'll see what I mean if you visit this place during the night hours.  Overall I love occasionally stopping by this place.  Try the Fried Chicken for lunch.  It's good.",

We are young, so our ears work perfectly fine. The food came out extremely quickly. I ordered breakfast (eggs, hash browns, bacon, toast, grits and a pancake). My husband ordered dinner (philly cheesesteak with fries). Our food was very bland. No seasoning or flavor to taste. I used salt and pepper to make my food more appealing. My husbands sandwich was very bland too. No flavor. I figured at least his food would have some sort of kick to it. We didn't understand all the hype about this place. Their sweet tea is extremely sweet. Which is perfect.",

I gave the server $40 cash. When he returns with my change he only gave me $2 change. I was in a hurry to get back to work and didn't notice the difference. I left him an additional $4  on the table and left. When I got close to work it dawned on me that the server owed me $12 in change, not $2.  I called back to the restaurant and spoke to the manager (Kia) who explained that there's no way for them to track cash payments.  She stated that she would call the server to question him since his shift ended shortly after the lunch hour rush, and call me back. I didn't get a callback. I really hope that it's not commonplace for their servers to swindle patrons out of money.  The manager made no attempt to make this right for me. I was only left with the possibility that I may get a call back from the General Manager.  It's only $10, but it's my $10.  It doesn't matter if the food was good or if the atmosphere was nice, they stole from me. This restaurant will never get my business again.  I'm so disappointed.",

Their sausage gravy is probably the best in the area, I always order it on the side.   Coming from the north, I did expect a \"diner\" experience, meaning you order food and it's out in an unimaginably quick time. Not the case here, but that's not a qualm, just something I didn't know of when I went here the first time.   Parking- their lot is small, but there's a big pay lot behind the diner and there are spots (free) that are labeled for the Midnight Diner.   Also, expect a wait on weekend breakfasts and late night. Late night...it gets crazy inside. Overall, it's definitely worth a stop if you're in the South End area.",

Nevertheless, if I drive across town for an early breakfast, I need a better explanation of the situation. OPEN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. Or not.",

So you tel me there's multiple empty tables, and you're pushing me to the \"Second to the last table\" in the place?   I can eat anywhere.

During this visit, I ordered a veggie egg white omelet, grits, and wheat toast.   It was all very good. The service was also good.  Best of all, the atmosphere is a throw back to the 1950s.  It is just a feel good place.  The outside of the restaurant is so alluring.  If you are passing by, you will definitely want to pop in for a meal.  The other thing that I like is the view of the uptown skyline.    If you like photography, you can have a blast from their parking lot. Definitely go, if you haven't been.  It might be the best diner option in town.",

It's weird because the restaurant itself isn't huge but it seems like they are always able to accommodate whatever size crowd is thrown their way. The customer service was A1, Tru took great care of us and displayed incredible knowledge of the menu. She also made sure we didn't wait too long for refills and she consistently kept us informed on the status of the food. As far as our meals, I had the shrimp tacos which were delightful, and a side of macaroni and cheese which also didn't disappoint AT ALL!! Totals for 2 meals was just shy of $25 so priced very well for a place with a reputation as theirs. I will definitely be back to explore more of their menu and will certainly invite everyone to dine here!!",

Pros: variety of options, all day breakfast, great seasoning on this visit (even though I've been several times) my food came out super fast! I ordered the infamous shrimp and grits and it DID NOT DISAPPOINT ! Just writing the review my mouth is watering. My friend got Mac n cheese and I tried it reluctantly knowing I would want more. It was so good! The shrimp tacos looked delicious! Everything is almost always seasoned to perfection and the biscuit is so soft and fluffy!   Out waitress tru was really nice and gorgeous! She even came to check on me when she thought I didn't like my shrimp and grits and I was just savoring the moment . The water was oddly hot when we asked for no ice. That was weird. We were sat immediately which was impressive considering how packed they are!   I highly recommend people visit here at anytime of the day. I've also tried their waffles and chicken. The waffles are HUGE and fluffy- honestly this place is so good I actually order without hesitation and I always take a long time to order",

Honestly at first I was turned off because I didn't want to deal with the busyness, but decided to wait considering this place always got rave reviews.   After getting seated, our waitress was super nice & attentive. She was patient with my friend & I because we were so indecisive. We wanted literally everything on the menu. I settled with the Midnight French which is French toast, your choice of meat (I got turkey sausage), eggs (I got overeasy), and a side (I chose hash browns).  Okay so the sides were pretty basic: nothing to get hype about. BUT THAT FRENCH TOAST!!!!!! I regret getting a half order (2 slices). I got the coco French toast which is essentially French toast with corn flakes and coconut shavings/ flakes. It. Was. So. Good. And the bread isn't thin either- thick...similar to Texas toast style.    Oh something else worth noting: service was FAST. It was super packed/busy so I anticipated to wait at least 25-30 min. No- my food came out 10 min after ordering. I will definitely return for a full order of that coco French toast",

We did come around 2-3 am though on a Friday so it was pretty busy so I will cut them slack on that. I do think they should handle their crowds better with the lines that's why I am taking off a star, the crowd got kinda crazy at times. I would come back but probably more so during a week night or during the day. I went last night and it reminded me why I don't come here during the weekends anymore it's too crazy here. People should definitely be aware of that when dining here late night. Parking can also get crazy at night, with people just driving everywhere and running in front of cars. I guess because they are drunk? I don't know. I think there should definitely be more security here like at Red Eye but to each their own.",

Server disinterested, beyond rude( walked away abruptly when a concern over food quality was expressed) zero listenening skills or attention span.   3burger/fries ordered, no way meat is ground fresh, over cooked , tough and similar to jerky in texture to dry to taste if seasoned.  Hand cut fries, limp, underseasoned, cold, why bother?  Staff seemed more consumed and concerened with their inner circle than actual customers.  I felt sorry for the line of people entering when we left.  Like us maybe they just didn't know better.  One of the few times I would never go back.  First impressions: horrible.",

I was a little disappointed in the waffles, they were a little dense. It made it seem like it wasn't cooked all the way. The fish dinner was incredible. It was light and battered just right.   Now, this is a great place to people watch on a Friday or  Saturday night. I saw some very entertaining things. The 21st century iTunes Jukebox is great.

To be honest I have no memory of the first trip so this review is for the Sunday brunch which was great. It's a small dinner with booths and a \"bar\" I guess.. not sure what to call it. We arrived semi early for brunch so there wasn't much of a wait but by the time we left there was a line out of the door. The food was really good especially the eggs and they give good portions. The wait staff was attentive and friendly ! The best part was the music playing it was such a variety and who doesn't like to hear a little Usher \"Climax\" on a Sunday morning!!   We were charged .50 to add cheese to the eggs... the waitress didn't mention this but I'm sure it was on the menu somewhere ... overall nice spot to pick up a quick bite to eat.",

She was right. Shrimp and grits were $9.99 and cooked fresh when I placed the order. They were the best I've ever had - great texture, creamy and with a Creole sauce and jumbo shrimp. They were served with a huge, also excellent, biscuit.   Our waitress was friendly and efficient. She checked in to make sure I liked the food and offered to pack up the leftovers, send me off with more lemonade, etc. All of the staff seemed pretty sharp and customers were a good and fun mix of groups of friends plus families.

    "text": "I usually get the fried chicken here, which is delicious.  It comes with a biscuit that's sadly usually old or overcooked that I end up not eating, but I don't really care 'cuz it's free.  They have French toast which is made of that huge challah bread and tastes like you're eating bread that's been dipped in the eggs from god's ovaries, ohhh it's that yummy.  (God has ovaries right?  He's like, both, right, has everything?)  Their chicken noodle soup is sadly a disappointment.  I'm always on the search for delicious chicken noodle soup, and theirs was all... bleh.  The broth was icky and the noodles were thin and twirly.  Restaurant chicken noodle should be thick strips of noodles, you foolish fools, not twirly little pathetic bastards!!  But that's not why they get four stars instead of five.  The reason is their music.  Usually I come there late at night and, I dunno, I guess they're going for this trendy club-atmosphere or something, because they BLAST that shit and it's awful.  It's not that I hate the music (which I do because it's awful trendy crap, but I could change it by picking something out of the jukebox if I wanted), it's that it's SO.  Friggin'.  Loud.  I guess, I dunno, the rest of you people have so completely damaged your hearing that you don't notice, but to me it's physically painful.  It's like sound warfare and I feel like I'm being attacked.  Plus I can't actually talk to my companion(s) without shouting at them.  Since atmosphere is a big deal when going out to eat, there have been a few times where we've decided NOT to go there because we aren't in the mood to put up with such loud nose.  But you know, they change that and bam.  I'll give 'em five stars.  And since we all know how much everyone wants MY five stars, I bet they'll be doing it within minutes.  Huhuhuhuhuh.  Update:  They don't do cheese fries anymore.  For some reason.  Considering cheese fries is just melting cheese on fries, both of which they have, in like a microwave or under a heat lamp, this loses them a star.  It was my favorite side.  :C",

    "text": "Let's just say I waited a few months to let Midnight Diner work out the supposed kinks I've been reading about, because I had a pretty tasty dining experience here! If I could give half stars, Midnight would earn a 3.5 overall.   The place: 24/7 diner that's quite snazzy looking. It's a really modern take on a vintage diner, if that makes any sense at all.   The scene: 8:30 am breakfast with a buddy on a chilly Thursday morning  The staff: Really, really friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Lisa, our server, was really laid back and offered some great menu suggestions - even noting that certain items were best for a hangover. That's important knowledge, folks.   The food: I went with a veggie egg white omelet, side of wheat toast and they let me sub fruit for grits. My buddy and I also shared a side of turkey sausage, too. My omelet was of average size (not behemoth) and stuffed with veggies and melty cheese...just what I was looking for. The toast was, er, toast! The fruit was fine but I'm not sure how fresh it really was...almost tasted like it had been refrigerated for some time. No worries though. The turkey sausage patties were flavorful and a nice accompaniment to my eggies.   The price: A touch more expensive than I expected, but then again each order comes with quite a bit of food. I believe my omelet was in the $7-$8 range but it comes with a side of grits or hashbrowns and toast. Carby carby! I will note that the turkey sausage was $2 for two small patties...a wee bit pricey but tasty nonetheless.   So, overall the food was good - a solid choice for a low key meal. I'm sure I'll be back to Midnight Diner as it's really, really close to my house and one of the few spots open all hours of the week. However, I do enjoy another local diner quite a bit more due to the freshness and overall vibe of that place.",

Perfect for a late night meal after a show at the Music Factory, Midnight Diner welcomed us with bright neon lights and a staff that was more enthusiastic than a well tipped stripper. I'm pretty sure there were more waitresses than patrons at this time of night and they were all giddy over what ever song was playing on the jukebox. Our very own Pourina R was seen dancing with waitresses at said jukebox and I got called out for singing along to some 80s pop ballad. This was the fun type of atmosphere the diner had at midnight.   I got the french toast and, OMG, the slices of bread were gigante. One and a half inch thick challah bread dipped in delicious french toast batter, dusted with powdered sugar and drizzled with syrup. It was so enjoyable (and filling) that I was able to revisit it again the next morning.   My dining mates all got fried chicken with mac n cheese and some other side. I recall all mac n cheese being gone by the end (or middle) of the meal, so it must've been good.   Parking lot is unpaved, bathrooms are clean, and jukebox is ready to go. I believe this is now my favorite diner in the QC.",

I was afraid of what kind of fruit I would get since I was ordering \"fresh fruit\" at a diner, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was very fresh chunks of pineapples, pears, and grapes! My omelet was very good. I also had a side of the mac and cheese but it was not what I was looking for. It was a little heavy for my taste. Others at the table had the fried chicken, mashed potatoes, pancakes, and one tried a burger. Everybody seemed very satisfied with their food. I would be interested to try this place again.

I went here for lunch by myself and sat at the countertop area in front for the TV. Nice that Sportscenter was on for me. The menu is extensive and detailed. About 7-8 pages I think, but don't be intimidated by the thinkness. It's just the words that are big, probabloy for those visiting late night that can't see so clearly.   Ordered the \"midnight special\" which is your typical breakfast place 2 of each. 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 bacon/sausage and hashbrowns. All this for $8.99 (see biz pic as I took one). Maybe an extra $1 too much or so, but for the size of the pancakes I can see how they justify it. Only issues was that my over-easy eggs were a little too runny in terms of the egg white. Probably go over-medium to be safe.   A lot of people running around and I did see some food come back ans I was sitting in front of the expediting area. That said; my meal was good and I'd probably go back again.",

I'm glad we went here! This is definitely a True diner. The greasy smell is overwhelming, as it should be. Ladies, just to warn you, don't come here right after getting your hair done, because it took me two washes to get the smell out of my hair. Aside from that, the portions are huge!! My bosses had overflowing plates and could hardly finish it all. Me on the other hand? Well, I would recommend you don't bother with the chicken tender meals. I ordered the biggest size they had and was pretty disappointed. The reason for this is because the tenders are really, really, really tiny. I'm serious. They were about half the size of a typical one from Zaxby's. I had probably twice as many French fries as I did chicken tenders. They didn't taste bad or anything though. My waitress also forgot to bring me the dipping sauce that was supposed to go with them. They are a little bland. Try to order something else. The French toasts and biscuits are massive. The syrup is really good. With such an expansive menu, it's almost a disservice to order something as plain as their chicken tenders and fries.",

I will be coming back here to try out the chicken as it seems to be what this diner does best! I will also return for a omelette to see how they compare to the NY diners!",

The patrons here are varied (the drunk, buzzed, almost-passed out, and people who just look like they got hungry in the middle of the night). I recommend getting filled up here if you've finished your night of partying and drinking. You'll feel much better the next morning. For the more sober customers though, the food is just okay. Servings are relatively large but I didn't care for the chicken and waffles. The chicken was decent--the classic Southern stuff. But, the waffles were sort of mushy like a defrosted eggo waffle.",

    "text": "Overall, the food and service were a-ok, but nothing about this visit blew me away.  As other reviewers have mentioned, parking is sparse, especially when you are there at lunchtime on a weekday.    Since I was by myself, I just sat at the counter.  The place was pretty busy and it took awhile before anyone came to take my drink order so I already knew what I wanted to order when my server finally did stop by.   I figured since I was at a diner, I couldn't go wrong with ordering breakfast.  I went with black coffee and the San Bernardino Omelet. The coffee was pretty good and did not taste burnt.  The omelet was made with diced chicken, cheddar cheese, avocado, and pico de gallo.  I went with hash browns as my side and whole wheat toast.    Overall, the omelet was not bad, but I did not care for the pico de gallo - it had too much harsh onion flavor for my taste. I pushed it to the side but unfortunately, it left an aftertaste of onion on part of my omelet.   The hash browns were \"meh\"... a little bland and just a touch on the greasy side. (I probably should have gone for the grits.... I saw in another review that they were creamy and tasty.)  The toast was not really toasted at all, which was not good.   (As a side note, while I was waiting for my order, I had a peek at their biscuits, and based on how yummy they looked, I should have gone with the biscuit instead!)  Another thing I spied while I waited for my dish was a plate of chicken & waffles...which looked pretty good.  If I go back, I may have to give that a try.    The employees were very busy, but nice, and I think if I had gone at a less busy time, I would have gotten more attentive service.  However, the manager did come by to see how I liked my omelet, so I appreciated that.   At $12.95 for a coffee & an omelet plus $3 for tip, the price was a little higher than I had expected when I walked in the door.   But, the menu is quite extensive, so if I happen to be in the neighborhood again, I would stop in to give them another try.",

She apologized and said they had just sprayed and he must have been a stray. Um, okay?!?  We decide to stay despite this because my wife really wanted shrimp and grits and had read that theirs were good.   Food comes... My burger had literally the nastiest looking shredded lettuce which smelled like it was turning and was a lovely pale yellow/green color and the tomato had the hard stem included in the center.  Completely inappropriate for a sandwich of my kind. I try to make the best of it and just dissect the burger and rebuild it. I squeeze some ketchup out for my hash browns and the taste was so foul I just couldn't bare to eat them. The ketchup was in one of those red picnic bottles and obviously had been refilled over and over again, and never cleaned out, because the ketchup tasted old and thick-- just plain bad.  We will NOT be back!   I suggest Eddies Place or The Diamond instead if you are in the mood for delicioua diner food along with a clean establishment and quality service.",

Among the best fried chicken I've had in the South, too.  The large, Belgian waffle was a bit soft rather than crispy, but tasted good (and some people like waffles soft).  Maple syrup comes on the side so you can add as much or as little as you like.  Grits are very buttery so you won't need to add butter to them.  Cooked just right and creamy and yummy.  Satisfied my grits craving nicely.  My companions enjoyed their 3-egg breakfasts with bacon, and my Canadian friend tried grits for the first time.  He likes them.  :)  Very busy on a Sunday for brunch/lunch so expect to wait about a half hour to get seated.  Small amount of waiting in the foyer so if it's hot or rainy that day you should bring an umbrella for some shade while standing outside.  Alcohol available is limited to beer and a handful of distilled spirits.  Price of the meal depends a lot on what you order, as this place has a huge menu that is served 24/7.  But the three of us had breakfast for around $40 total.",

So, let's get this out of the way. The food is 5-stars ... and by food I mean Chicken and Waffles ... and by Waffles I mean French Toast. I could literally eat their Chicken and French Toast for any meal of the day and I already have. I'm guessing their other menu items are delicious as well, but why mess up a good thing. I'm dinging them a star because it gets a little cray at night. You literally have to get pat down by an armed police office in order to pick up your take-out at 2am. I mean, I'll do it because once again the Chicken and French Toast is bomb, but yeah I don't like mine with a side of potential stabbing / drive-by. I will say that there's some pretty good people watching in the after-club hours. All shapes, colors, ethnicity, creed, organisms, and nations of ratchet. From the trap stars to the drunken southern bell that missing a shoe. Priceless entertainment ...  All and all, Midnight is the quintessential diner and I urge anybody to give it a try if they're in Charlotte. If this review has proved useful to you, please show your thanks by providing me with an order of Chicken and French Toast. :-) ... just kidding.  but for real though ... :-|",

Don't get me wrong, until recently I too was a Price's True believer. . .Midnight is better  It's clearly brined, given a gentle salt H2O soak (and possibly buttermilk) and hand tossed.  The oil is peanut.  It's fresh and not over-used.  The crust is lightly peppery, the mashed potatoes are homemade with JUST the right amount of pleasing potato chunks and you have a choice of classic southern white gravy or brown love.    Again, dig Price's for a quick in-and-out greasy adventure.  Nirvana is achieved at Midnight.  Couple lunch with a hand made strawberry shake.  AHHHH.    My apologies to many in the Charlotte Metro Region.  Don't believe me, go there now.  Oh, that's another plus, to wit:  MidNight is open 24/7, 355 days a year.  (Closed Christmas.)  No, I'm not an owner, a friend of an owner or stockholder.  Just DIG their chicken.",

The staff is overall friendly  (unless dealing with impatient, intoxicated people during the late night hours which is understandable).

However, once my food came out....Let's just say, I don't get the hype. Maybe it was an \"off day\" but my pancakes were teerrrible... I mean, how can I put this. You really can't screw up eggs, hash browns and bacon - this is almost IMPOSSIBLE to screw up. The pancakes? This is the only reason why I came. The pancakes were: FLAT, TASTELESS, PLAIN and Tasted like boxed pancake mix, mixed with water. These were some really bad pancakes. There was zero flavor and looked undercooked. FLAT. Oh, I said that already. The only reason why I'm giving it a 3 stars? Well, my husband liked his French toast. I'm going to give it another try because my coworkers SWEAR this place is great but I will steer clear from the Midnight Diner Special. No pancakes for me.   The service? This was another blah - I don't ask for much. But he was not attentive at all.",

The Diner is located in Uptown (Downtown), where the only other business open is their neighboring bottom of the barrel Strip Club. It's got a Menu full of your average greasy diner food served by fine middle aged ladies with a slew of bad tattoos to go with their bad attitudes, who are probably going to be chewing gum to cover up their cigarette breath. These lovely ladies look like they ended their tenure at the Strip Club years ago after too many cigarettes and whiskey and way too much diner food, so they just moved on over and started waiting tables for dollar tips all the same. Go here if you enjoy that sort of ambience, sometimes I do.",

Their Belgian waffles are great and you can get fruit topping added which is the perfect pair. The fruit topping is an extra charge, and seems a bit high to me for what you get, but it makes the waffles even better so I get it. I usually order eggs over medium which I've come to find is hard get right while eating out. I ended up with over easy, but that seems to happen at every restaurant I order eggs at.  Today I got the bacon, egg and cheese biscuit which was bomb. They really do biscuits right here and give you good deal of cheesy goodness to go with. No gross clear, fatty bacon here, it's the good stuff. And my co-diners all enjoyed their \"Bubba\" (which I've had and is awesome everytime) and the coconut french toast which I tried and really is good. Doesn't taste overwhelmingly coconutty so you still get a nice crunchy sweet french toast on HUGE, THICK challah bread... so good!  I'd recommend Midnight Diner to any breakfast goer or late night eater. Every time I've been there it's been a good meal and the service is always on point with a friendly smile and quick service.",

Twice now I have been to this adorable little diner; once on a weekday, once on a weekend.  The decor in here is a throwback to old diners, with checkered patterns, red and white chairs, and awesome neon lights.  They also have framed records on the wall, and much of the time play music from the 60s.    The staff is pretty friendly and helpful as well.  On my first visit here, one of the waitresses was singing and dancing along with the music.  It was awesome!  Both times, our food came pretty quickly and was nice and toasty warm.  Now, onto the food, which was tasty!  They seriously have the best grits I have ever eaten.  I had The Bubba the last time, which was biscuits and gravy, grits, sausage links, and cheddar scrambled eggs.  It was fabulous; the gravy was mildly peppery and delish, a perfect topping for the biscuits.  My partner had the chicken and waffles - the chicken was so tender and juicy, I have never had a chicken wing like that.    Maybe someday I'll venture to try their dinner items, but this is definitely my new go-to place for breakfast. The construction going on there right now makes it difficult to get in and out, with parking being a bit of a pain.  Still, it's worth it to fight through the workers to go, especially considering that the construction (hopefully) won't last forever.",

Upon entering during a busy weekday morning, we were seated pretty quickly, but the hostess and people behind the counter did not appear friendly.

Uhhh....not so much hammer-and-nail here, but how about a nice trip down the highway on the back of a semi-truck? Sure. Rad. Pretty rad indeed.   Churning out pancakes, waffles, hashbrowns, omelets, and burnt coffee like they're going out of style, Midnight Diner is a haven for late-night carbloaders from all corners of Crown Town. If you're showing up for a 5-star meal, you might want check yourself at the door. It's a diner through and through. Low ceiling, cushy booths, counter seating, jukebox, old waiters, waitresses, line cooks. Like a Norman Rockwell. Just great.   You'll most likely walk out smelling like a mixture of vegetable oil and bad coffee, but sometimes pancakes are the only thing that will satiate an all-night rage before you hit the sack.   I'm especially fond of the hashbrowns that come \"smothered, scattered, and chunked.\" Cheese, onions, and ham. Also, biscuits and gravy in this joint are spot on.   Glad that Midnight Diner is around and keeping Charlotte's nightlife well-fed with good ol' \"brinner.\"",

Breakfast and brunch items as well as soul food offerings. The music is too loud and our waitress didn't have the best attitude. Overall, a good experience.",

It could've used more seasoning, that's subjective. All in all, it's a good spot for a quick late night bite with the homies or a mistress.",

    "text": "What you would expect in a Diner..... A good simple and hearty breakfast.  They have all the standard breakfast fare, be it omelets (egg white variety too), pancakes, french toast or belgian waffles.  They have amazingly tasty and buttery biscuits so forego the toast for the biscuit, and order a side of sausage gravy to split with your table.  Also the grits are amazing, and I'm not a huge grits fan, but these suckers have butter or cream in them that make them delectable.  I suggest having one person get grits and others in your party get the hash browns and you go halfsy and share.  The Friendly staff seem like they have been there for years, and they are efficient at least while sitting at the counter where I was.  Believe me you will leave this place exceptionally full that will last you all day.  I'm still full while writing this review, and I was there about 6 hours ago :)",

I showed up and, as according to their policy, waited outside for my order to be ready, accompanied by two police who were guarding the door. After a good bit of time passed, I tried to speak to the host desk about the progress of my order, only to be very aggressively denied access by one of the police. Time comes and several thwarted attempts at speaking with an employee of the business come and go(gotta love cops) and I have been standing outside for forty five minutes waiting for a to go order that I was quoted ten on. Finally a more reasonable police officer offers to find a manager for me, amanager comes outside and inquires about people waiting for Togo food. My food had been ready for twenty minutes and I had been unable to access it and even unable to access an employee to ask about it because of one of the hired police officers guarding the door like a bridge troll.The food and the service are always good here and the management was very gracious in this particular instance. I just hope going forward that they scrutinize a bit more about what type of security they hire.  PS my food, upon receiving it after this whole ordeal, was still delicious.",

We arrived at the diner late at night, and was pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere of the restaurant. It was a good mixture of past and present, and the place was packed! Definitely a good sign for someone who wants good food.  I ordered the chicken and waffles and didn't have to wait long at all. Though maybe time passes quickly because my friends and I were talking so much...  Well, whatever the case, the food was so good! I'm not exactly a chicken and waffles connoisseur, but those may have been among  the best chicken and waffles I've had.   Oh they also deserve some brownie points for the way they train their employees. My friends and I happened to visit on a training night, and it was so nice to see the new hires being guided thoroughly and patiently by the experienced employees. A completely different experience from that one time I worked in the fast food industry... *shudders*",

Huge serving, and plenty of sauce, which in my opinion sets excellent shrimp and grits from just okay shrimp and grits.",

    "text": "3.5 stars   We've come here before, I had the dynamite shrimp grilled.. Was ok, not spicy at all though. We decided to stop by again today for brunch. It was packed but luckily the bar was wide open.. Who needs tables right? Our server was not as attentive as I had hoped though she was nice. Only filled out waters once. It also seemed very busy but still.   I got the midnight special with a side of rye toast while the bf got the bubba special. Food didn't take too long considering the crowd. Wow, I got a lot of food, couldn't finish it. The grits were so good! It feels like so much butter you think there was cheese in there. Not for the dieter. The chocolate chip pancakes were good, I like that they give the syrup warmed. I took stars off because I asked for poached eggs and a majority of my eggs were overcooked, almost to a full boil. Bleh.. The rye was also overly toasted and very hard. The bf's bubba special looked amazing, I couldn't take a pic, he ate it too fast lol open faced biscuit, cheddar scrambled eggs, sausage gravy, hash browns and turkey sausage. Very yummy and great bang for your buck! I'm getting this breakfast the next time I'm feeling eggs!   We also took a slice of chocolate cake home. It's very rich.. Took 3 days for us to take it down. Tip: use vanilla ice cream.. It balances the richness. Midnight is open 24/7, nice! Great drunk munchies! Breakfast, lunch and dinner, everything sounds good. Will be back, hopefully my eggs are the way I like it. Maybe for the shrimp and grits next time, imagined they are very good here.",

Don't be put off by the parking signs - on weekends, parking is free.   Even on a Saturday, we were seated very fast.  Service is very matter-of-fact and efficient, but not Charlotte-friendly.  We liked their coffee, since it's stronger than most diner coffee.  And our food came out very fast.  But here's where it gets really good...the food!  I had The Bubba, an open-faced sausage gravy biscuit with scrambled eggs (including cheddar, yes!), and their creamy grits.  I thought Flying Biscuit's grits were the best until I tried Midnight Diner's.  I don't know, it's a toss-up now between the two.  And the eggs and biscuit/gravy were just perfect.    My husband had their corned beef hash slam.  He gets this dish a lot, and thought Midnight Diner's was the best yet.    We have returned a few times, and my husband always gets their corned beef (still the best he's had), but I've tried other items, such as the standard eggs with bacon, biscuit, yadda yadda.  Their hash browns and grits are both phenomenal.  Once you've tried both, try just picking one of them!  I always get both.  :)",

She even cared about the fact that I'm pregnant and made sure that my food was well done and the broccoli cooked with no salt. Great service. The food didn't take too long to be prepared and everything tasted really good.  I got the hamburger steak with broccoli and mac n cheese and my husband got grilled cheese and breaded chicken tenders. It was all really delicious. For drinks we just got ginger ale that was always refilled, and that's how it should be. Overall we had a great experience and will for sure be visiting again.",

This French toast is made of thick slices of challah bread, grilled lightly, and served with melted honey butter and warm syrup. The French toast was lightly dusted with powdered sugar. While I didn't choose a particularly healthy option, I did look for one and there were several omelet options that looked very appealing and there were many options. I plan to get up early for my morning flight out of town to go back for another round of French toast or to try one of their omelettes. I would also add that my waiter, Dave was great and we bonded over our love of honey butter and he strongly suggested the coconut encrusted French toast.",

Less awesome was the torn up seat with the red duct tape over it, the broken AC, the pace of service, and the actually warm (not tepid) water served (we were given a full cup of ice, but the point of no ice in my water is to avoid ice...).  Also, the ketchup was very, very watery.  Our two male staff members were friendly, but some of the women seemed rude to their customers and the manager had to yell at people at least three different times while I was there to sort silverware as they ran out twice.  We were also given someone else's signed credit card receipt.  Awkward!",

Bad customer service as they don't even maintain a list of the guests you just have to stand all the time strict notice outside that you're not allowed to use the restroom unless you get a seat :O.  Coming to the food we ordered the famous Shrimp and Grits, Chef Lee's famous fried chicken with the side of mashed potatoes and gravy, fruits and Banana pudding. Shrimp and Grits were good 3/5. It has good flavor but you need not come just for that. Chef Lee's famous fried chicken big no to this 1/5. This wasn't a good experience I am not sure if it was oil or not great meat but we just left it like that.  Banana pudding was ok 2/5. I wouldnt suggest this place for people from East coast. You will be disappointed.",

After that, not so much.  Prices are good. Breakfasts are large. The sliders come with mayonnaise on them which I despise, so that kinda ruined one of the lunches. Had a spaghetti with meat sauce as a special last week that was truly bland and soggy -- and the most expensive item on the special menu. Also had the smallest Texas toast I'd ever seen.   Was there a few days ago on a sort of busy day and the staff were absolutely in the weeds. Couldn't even point people to empty, clean tables. We waited ages, with our small child getting increasingly unruly, before my husband just finally took a seat. They seemed annoyed by that and took forever to bring set-ups, water etc. I'd hate to see them when they were really full. As we left there was a line out the door and quite a few empty tables; the staff just never found their rhythm.  The place is clean and there is a good jukebox. At times the music can be too loud, but it's fun. I like this place and will probably return for staples like breakfast or a burger, but will stay away from their specials. I'll keep looking for the diner experience I know that's done better in other parts of the country.",

    "text": "DAMMIT. I want to like this place. Seriously, Midnight Diner, I want to like you. I want you to be my place where I go when I need to get a quick lunch, or a greasy breakfast to bring back to the office when I have a hangover. Why can't you be that diner? WHY?   I'm updating my review. Unfortunately, I can't add any more stars to it because, well, it was really a two star experience. I had previously only had lunch at this place, and if you've noticed my other review, obviously wasn't impressed. Everyone kept telling me that for a good experience, I needed to get their breakfast food. I didn't really know when that opportunity was going to happen, since I'm not a huge breakfast food fan, and I only work near here, not live near here. Then - BOOM. Heavy night of happy hour Thirsty Thursday-style, and this morning I was feeling the need for greasy breakfast. My head was saying, \"Diner, this is your chance.\"   I ordered to go: biscuit with sausage gravy, an egg over easy, side of bacon, hash browns. Picked up my order with good timing, and as always, the staff was friendly, attentive, and awesome. Never have any complaints on my end about that. I like the people, which makes this even worse.  The worst part was the bacon. This sentence carries a lot of weight, because usually in my life I'm more prone to saying, \"The best part was the bacon,\" and I'm talking in reference to anything. I have never not finished bacon until this moment. You could tell that underneath the overcooked, dried, burntish bits that it was good, thick, applewood smoked bacon that would have been INCREDIBLE if it had just been cooked right! I had to stop eating it not because of the taste, but because my jaw hurt from trying to chew it.   Eggs had no salt on them. I asked for over easy, but there was that transparent rawness to them that suggested more sunny side up. The hash browns were also flavorless. No seasoning/salt/pepper/nothing. Also, kind of soggy instead of crispy. I put some of the sausage gravy on them to make them a little more appealing.   Saving grace: biscuit and sausage gravy. I uh, didn't actually get around to eating them yet, but from the looks of it that scratch-made biscuit is going to be tasty, and from what I tasted of the sausage gravy, it's the best I've tried yet. Then again, this is my first restaurant sausage gravy.   I'll iterate from before: I hope that if I have to go to this place again, I'll be able to return with a more positive review. Still waiting for that good food experience.",

    "text": "I try not to go to extremes when reviewing things; when those around me pile on the criticism, I try to find a silver lining. But it's hard to find anything that went right on my first visit to Midnight Diner.  We were seated promptly. That's the good news. My guest and I both ordered a mushroom swiss burger for lunch: Hers all the way, mine with lettuce and no other trimmings. She got fries, I got onion rings. Coffee for her, Diet Coke for me.  Then we waited. And waited. About 40 minutes. Lunch rush? It was busy, but not that busy.  When our food finally arrived, it was all wrong. Her burger came with mushrooms and swiss, but no toppings. Mine came with the lettuce, but no mushrooms. By the time we realized it, the waitress was gone. Five minutes later, my guest was able to flag her down about the condiments. She scurried away, presumably to remedy the mix-up; the condiments never scurried back.  To call my burger skimpy would be a disservice to skimpy burgers. The burger was sliced in half, and after one bite of the first half, I was left with mostly bun. Maybe the left half of that particular cow would be meatier...  The waitress did re-emerge eventually to refill our drinks. She offered to bring me another Diet Coke. She brought Dr. Pepper instead. The straw was nice, though.  It's a shame: I've been waiting for a good all-night diner in Charlotte (other than Landmark). I guess I'll keep waiting.",

Well it's finally here and I'm glad because it was pretty good for its second to third day open! Parking is annoying...not many spots.  The server was really overwhelmed when we first got there but turned it around midway through. It took a few minutes to be approached and then a little more time for our order to be placed but I figure it couldve been worse!!   It's rainy and gloomy in Charlotte today so I opted for the \"Famous\" Fried Chicken with Mashed Potatoes and Gravy....Famous? What makes it famous? (like in ELF when he finds the \"Worlds Best Coffee\"...I love that movie, anyways)The flavor was lacking and seasoning was needed, but the fry on it was good and the chicken was moist. The mashed potatoes were also bland along with the gravy.   All in all not that great of an experience BUT it has all the potential to be great once they figure things out! The servers are still learning the menu as the chefs are too! I will be back only to be proven right that they just need a few days to get into their groove!!",

And, the silver prefab pod thingey is a trippy novelty if your'e in a \"creative\" mindspace. The inside is lit with yellow recessed lights accented with pink neon, so it's bright but not harshly so. Service was great and the food was acceptable. We ordered the uptown breakfast(s) and I had a side of mac n' cheese. The portions were smaller than I had anticipated but I don't suppose you really want large portions of the kind of foods they serve. The mac n cheese was mostly butter topped shredded orange cheese which I assume was cheddar.  Coffee was excellent and our server was prompt about refilling. They have just obtained a liquor license so beer and liquor will become available in the coming weeks.   The dining experience was totally satisfactory for 'late night.' And, as music lovers, my party and I were digging the gold record montages.  Driving here is not recommended as there were at least 5 police cars on patrol and limited parking.",

    "text": "A real life diner, finally in uptown (or at least on the very edge).  Breakfast is served anytime along with a menu of mostly simple staples- burgers, sandwiches, and desserts- which are on full display at the front counter.  My wife and I went for breakfast on a Sunday recently, to see what this place was all about.  Atmosphere is mostly good: tight booths and bar seating in a long, narrow tin can of a space.  Large plasmas adorn the walls with a mix of local news and sports.  To be able to sit for breakfast without a wait on Sunday was a real treat, and I had high hopes at this point.  Service is mostly there, if not with a dash of attitude diners up north are known for.  Heaven help you if you are indecisive or ask for explanation of any menu item- our server at least acted like such a question would be heresy.    We both had breakfast and this is where things start to go downhill.  We both has eggs over medium that were more like over easy- too runny and loose for my taste.  We also ordered a few sides like mac and cheese.  These were small and not hot- like they had been made much earlier and didn't even make it under a warmer light for long enough.  The real issue, though, was with the kitchen and the other diners' entrees.  There was an air of unease amongst the other tables around us as people waited for food and then sent back orders that were under-prepared.  Servers seemed upset, themselves, but did little to put the guests at ease.  This place is new, so I get the sense the kitchen needs some seasoning working at this pace and then the staff needs to work out the timing.    All told, this likely fine for late night dining you are not likely to find elsewhere in the uptown area.  But, for a quality meal where time is not of the essence, I'd currently look elsewhere.",

I visited with my husband for breakfast one cold morning and even though the line was out the door, it moved pretty quick. We got shrimp & grits, hash with ham, onions, eggs, french toast and some other stuff. The french toast was HUGE and delicious. It is a must-try. The staff is friendly and although it can be a little loud it is worth it for the delicious food. GO FOR THE FRENCH TOAST!",

The atmosphere was very pleasant, clean, and playing old school r&b ( real music ) lol. Took my brother home a fried chicken dinner and let me say this is the closest to my grandmas southern fried chicken that we will ever get. The cook really has a blessed talent and loves what he does. Oh and the collard greens oh man to die for, and they wasn't cooked with any kinda meat, which is hard to find in the south. So I will definitely recommend and my mom and me has a new restaurant for our mother daughter day out.",

    "text": "Very excited to go to Midnight Diner for lunch today for a couple of reasons...1. ) wanted to see if this dining car had been built by my family (back in the day..Fordero Dining Car Company from New Jersey)..unfortunately it is wasn't, but it is a good looking dining car but missing the touches that I am familiar with.  2.) miss going to a New Jersey diner so wanted to see how it stacked up (can't stack up to a NJ diner experience..so put that thought out of your head)..3.) the food - and that is really what the 3 stars are for..  We got there about 12:30pm and was excited to see Hamburger Slider Combo for $5.95 - that is what my husband ordered.  My English teacher mom would be very upset that we didn't notice it said \"slider\" and not \"silderS\"..So, when the very small SINGLE slider showed up at the table my husband was not so pleased.  Not only was it a single slider it was a very thin slider..(think the waitress would have mentioned this fact since it was a male ordering the slider..she could have saved the meal by suggesting that if he was hungry he should opt for the full size burger). Slider was good but portion was not ample.  I must have lost my NJ mind at the front door because I ordered the shrimp and grits with Creole Sauce Special for $5.95. I forgot I was looking for the NJ experience because no diner in NJ has Shrimp and Grits on the menu..But I always order Shrimp and Grits if it's on the menu..that's just my thing..The grits and Creole Sauce were very good - maybe a little too soupy.  The shrimp were small, but what do you expect for $5.95.  But there were ample shrimp.  I might have felt better about the dish if there were about 5 larger prawns - but then I realize the price would have been more.  We will go back because the philly cheesesteak wrap (there are none of those in NJ diners either) and the regular size hamburgers looked good.  The free parking is a definite plus.   The menu has different items - there is something there for everyone.",

I have had everything from eggs and grits to hamburgers and apple pie and it is all delicious.  You just can't go wrong here.  Aside from the food, I love the fact that this is a 50's throwback diner.  You would think it has been around for years but in fact it is pretty new.  Despite it being a fairly recent addition to Charlotte, this diner has character that usually comes with age and lends itself as a great haunt for all times of day and night.  A quick tip: Saturday and Sunday get very busy so either be prepared to wait or time your arrival (especially on Sunday - be mindful as to when church services get out).",

I went on a Monday during lunchtime, and it wasn't bursting at the seams busy like many places South End, so I was happy because a a less busy place usually also means better service.   My waiter was a bit off putting, but the food came out soon and this is a diner, not Morton's so it's okay.   I ordered the handspun Strawberry milkshake which was delian! It tasted like it had real strawberries in it and the ice cream was thick and wonderful, as I could barely put my straw in the shake because it was so thick! Major kudos for that!!!!  I decided on the classic chicken and waffles....which were good but nothing spectacular....the dish definitely met \"diner\" sized expectations. The wings were crispy and hot just like I like 'em. The waffles here are thin, not Belgian style, but I actually felt that complimented the wings so that it didn't become a gluttonous meal...  The place was very \"Americana\", and looked like a regular recreated retro restaurant with Elvis posters everywhere.  The only negative is the parking, I wasn't there during a busy time and even then their tiny parking lot was full, so nighttime parking may be a hassle for those not arriving via light rail.

But the second time was a dull Wednesday evening with hardly anyone around, and service was sloooow. We were a bit early for a show at the Tremont and thought we'd grab a nearby bite at Midnight. There were only 2 other parties in the house, and we ordered 2 burgers and a plate of fries--and it took 20 minutes to come out.  Seriously? Diner time is like dog years; 20 minutes equals an hour and a half! Especially for a couple of BURGERS. Speaking of which, they were nicely topped (I got the Cali burger with avocado and added a side of jalapenos), but the meat wasn't seasoned and they were a little bland.

She provided us with great conversation and she never stopped smiling when she was at our table. That's what I like to see in a server: a great attitude. I liked the food too, although the pancakes could be a lot better. :( not affecting my score, though. I got a Philly cheesesteak to go and Jennifer suggested that I separated the bread from the meat to make sure that the bread wouldn't get soggy on the way home or when I put it in the fridge for my boyfriend whom works 3rd shift.

I think Midnight Diner is more about the cool, funky diner atmosphere and at any given hour (open 24 hours a day except for Christmas) contains all walks of life - which I love. We waited for a table for a bit and were seated in a plush red booth. I ordered an omelet and your standard breakfast fare. Again, decent. Nothing to write home about but certainly - good.  That day there were random tables of strangers arguing back and forth about the best NFL teams which was mildly interesting/annoying. Oddly enough, the Panthers were not being discussed. Anyway, I digress...   This place is an interesting and fun choice when you are in the mood to hang out in a lively diner on the fringe of Uptown Charlotte.",

I usually get the Shrimp and Grits, I must say ....it's better than my mother's. Hopefully she never reads this review. The fried chicken is my second favorite, along with the massive French toast. I always intentionally order more than I know I can eat, simply because I love to be in the presence of such wonderful food. Every time I bring someone here they become a believer, I should receive rewards points. You honestly can't go wrong with anything from here at anytime of day. I went in today with my little brother at 4pm and ordered and entire breakfast. Only because I could. If you have never been, I highly recommend. There is also one server who so passionately describes every dish on the menu, you would think he created and cooks them each personally. I could go on forever. But I will stop here.   Enjoy the edible.",

Wow. When the menu says creamy grits, it's True! They are rich and creamy, perfect for a Southern gal like me! The sausage gravy was some of the best I've ever had. The service was just right, not too much, not too little. I would definitely return. On a side note, I saw a guy there eating breakfast.  He had scrambled eggs covered in ketchup (LOL) and was drinking a Sam Adams! That's the beauty of a diner: you can have whatever you want, whenever you want (as long as local law allows)!",

    "text": "Yet another great visit to the diner. Went last night around 4 am- place was packed.   My server didn't greet me for a few minutes, another staff member had to notify her, but upon looking around, I saw why- she was taking care of 3 full tables way at the other end of the restaurant.   Let's take a brief moment to discuss a couple of food service basics. I notice these automatically because I work in food service, but others may not. It is the management's job to ensure that each server has the correct number of tables to handle at a time, and that those tables are spaced out a reasonable distance. In my opinion, having a server wait 3 loaded tables at one end of the restaurant plus stools in the bar at the other end is a bad management decision. So when I say that my server couldn't get to me, I say this knowing that it was not her fault. The manager should have taken notice of this and reassigned her section.  Just a habit to get into when you visit a restaurant- any restaurant-  when you first sit down, take note of how many other tables your server visits, where those tables are located in relation to yours, and how those tables are spaced out. (i.e., did you all get your entrees at the same time? Then you probably all ordered them at the same time, and the kitchen had to cook them all at the same time.) Then, judge the service accordingly once you have those answers. To whoever commented that they thought they had bad service because their server was triple sat- get a job waiting tables, become triple sat, and then complain. And please, speak to a manager if you have a problem, don't just automatically deduct it from your server's tip. Sure, if you see them standing in a corner doing nothing and you need a drink refill, there might be a problem, but more than likely it's because of something I mentioned above.   Ok, end soapbox.   I got the Midnight Burger, which is a hell of a deal. Their online menu is a little outdated, it seems, but a plain burger, served with fries, is $5.75. A Midnight burger, which comes with lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, and served with fries, is also $5.75. What is your problem if you did not order this burger? I want another one right now. I didn't get it with cheese and I should have, but it was perfect the way it was. The fries were good too, and there were so many I couldn't finish them.   So, bottom line is guys, it's a diner. This is exactly what I was expecting it to be, and it's exactly what I got. If you're expecting to be blown out of your chair with 5-star quality, go find somewhere else to eat at 4 in the morning.",

However, I am not here to review Charles.   Diner itself is cool. No police cars there today. Diner's are, as one reviewer put it, supposed to be places serving fast,greasy,cheap food in large quantities. Showmar's has larger quantities and the food is probably at least as good.     The service was fine. I had the Philly Cheeseteak but didn't order the a la carte fries. The sandwich was cooked well and tasty but I could have eaten three of them. My companion ordered the fried chicken sandwich and it looked small and he said it was only OK. He did order the a la carte fries though and they were very mediocre, at best.   I asked the server if I could order breakfast at lunch and she said no sir but they are thinking about changing that. Also said the a la carte sides are something management is looking at as well.   This place could be very cool but right now it has the feel of a corporate chain \"diner\". Diner's, Drive In's and Dives will not be stopping here anytime soon.",

I hoped something better than Landmark would one day be added to all the new nightlife. This is that hope. I didn't find the food compromised by the diner vibe at all. The challah was authentic & real maple syrup aren't exactly low brow. My suggestion: they have fried chicken AND waffles on the menu...but not together. What's that oversight about?",

Well, let me tell you I was not disappointed at this place who boasts the best chicken and waffles--I haven't had chicken and waffles (together) anywhere else in Charlotte but I have had chicken and I have had waffles in Charlotte and let me tell you I haven't found any that are better than Midnight Diner. Maybe it's the combination but its freakin' delicious. One of my friends got the same and a side of mac and cheese (gooey cheesiness, could use a little more flavor though) and she loved hers too! We were in C&W heaven. Our waitress was supernice, checked on us regularly and told us the truth when we asked questions about the menu (i.e. are the shrimp big or little in the shrimp and grits...LOL).  As I looked around the diner, everyone else seemed to be enjoying their meals too. While I can't visit toooo often I know that when I do I will be in for a treat. For some reason, I don't think they have anything bad on their menu. I hope they don't prove me wrong.   Oh and how great is it that they are open 24 hours--a definite need in Uptown. Yum-O.",

I don't know if the service and food have just really improved in the past two week, but my experience was pretty much the exact opposite of most of the reviews that I read.  We were seated immediately, even though the place was busy at 8:00 p.m. The wait staff were nice, and got us a soft drink in lightening speed while we perused the menu.  I ordered the country fried steak with mashed potatoes and green beans for sides. The country fried steak was awesome - exactly what I was hoping for. It was hand-breaded with a nice cream gravy. You could tell the mashed potatoes were handmade, and the green beans were just seasoned amazingly (I probably could have just had a giant bowl fo the green beans and been happy). My fiance got hand-breaded chicken tenders with mac and cheese, and had no complaints either.   The food came out within 10 minutes of ordering - and exactly like we ordered it. I couldn't have expected any quicker, especially since the place was pretty busy.  I really have no complaints about this place, and will be back regularly. The people that I've talked to about this place also love it - one guy I know has been there 12 times already. The only negativity that I've seen/heard has been online, and not just on this website either. But I had to give my two cents after an experience that I couldn't expect to have been any better. Quick service, good homemade food, friendly staff, and good prices - that pretty much sums it up for me.",

My GF really liked her slider which was the perfect size for her appetite.  My country fried steak was OK, but actually it was no where near as good as I had expected and hoped for, especially for the price ($9.99).  The beef was a bit tough and the breading wasn't crispy.  The gravy was ok, but usually is really salty and has a bit of kick to it as a result.  Despite my let down, everyone else's food was great and our server was really nice and attentive.  They also serve alcohol and was a steal at $2/beer or $1.50 for Sam Adams.  We didn't imbibe any, but it was nice to know the bargain was there.  This is a great place to hit up after going out in uptown.  The last time we went to a dump formally known as Waffle House on N. Tryon St. so this was a great experience.",

I went to the door and they have a line of people going out the door with police crime tape up and handwritten signs saying to stay out until they call you.  Once you get \"called in\" you have to do limbo under the police tape.  They sat me down towards the end of the diner.  I don't mind the music selection but they had it blasting to the point of distortion.  I sat there waiting for anyone to come and take a drink order or food order for 12 minutes.  I ended up turning on one of my TV shows on my phone and watched for a while until Anesha came to take my order.  She had herself and another person saying she was in training.  I placed my order for The Bubba and she told me it would be out in a few minutes.   My food came about 14 minutes later and I still had not received my drink nor any silverware.  The person who brought my food asked what my drink was and went and got that for me.  The food quality was pretty good minus a weird taste in the hashbrowns.  I finished my food and a little while later Anesha brought my check and told me there was no rush.  I went to pay and was told I had to wait for my waitress and then she came over.  I attempted to pay like I have here before with Samsung Pay and was told that I couldn't do that.   The manager the older white lady copped an instant attitude and told me that I was a liar and that I hadn't paid with my phone.  I have proof on my phone and statement that I have in fact used it here.  They then decided to bring the Charlotte Mecklenburg Police in to talk with me about it.  I greeted them and told them the situation and they didn't have much to say.  The only thing that he had to say was that \"they have rules\" I told him I understood that but there were no rules up at all talking about tap and pay or paying with my phone was not allowed.  The manager then smacks her lips and says that oh well I guess he's getting a free meal tonight.  The police then told me to \"have a good night\"  In fact, I would have never stepped foot into Midnight Diner had I known this new fact.  I choose not to do business with establishments who are unable or unwilling to accept payment.  The thing about Samsung Pay is it acts just like a regular card swipe but the sad fact is Midnight Diners POS is enabled for mobile payments they just choose not to accept them and now I know this but there was no excuse for the management treating me like trash and calling me a liar.  They are the liars because I can show evidence that they accepted my phone as well as witnesses who were there.  The biggest problem here is the slow service and treatment of guests.  I can say with certainty that I will never return to this location.",

    "text": "I've been here probably a dozen times since my last review, so I figured an update was in order. Midnight Diner provides tasty diner food at fair prices, but unfortunately the iffy and slow service really overshadows that.  FOOD/PRICES I'll start with the best part of Midnight Diner: the food. I have tried a fair share of the menu, and everything tastes great. The fried chicken is crisp and well-seasoned, the burgers are juicy and topped with fresh toppings, the sides are prepared well, etc. The prices are also fair for the most part, which is great. Dessert is a bit on the expensive side, though. There really is not much more to say here: excellent diner food at fair prices.  SERVICE The service at Midnight Diner is incredibly slow. It's not the kitchen, as plates frequently pile up in the window, and it is not a result of the place being understaffed. Whenever I bring a friend to Midnight Diner who has never been, he/she always remarks how many staff the place has. I think it's just poor training and bad management. I had the unfortunate experience of eating during a shift change once, and it was a disaster. No one knew who the host/hostess was, no one knew which tables they had, no one knew who was supposed to be cleaning, etc. Ordering dessert, getting a refill, or trying to pay is always a nightmare because of how slow and absent the servers are.  Overall, I really like Midnight Diner's food, but the incredibly slow service prevents me from going often.",

Right after we received our food, the waitress decided to come right back over to ask about the check (we literally just started eating). Then she comes over after a couple of minutes again and asks to take my friend's empty plate if he was finished....but it still had food on it. So he scraped the food onto another plate to get her out of our face. When we paid for the food, we have her exact change and she asked if we wanted change back Lol. I can't make this up. I'm sure they over charged us as well. My friend got the chicken and waffles with an extra side of 2 eggs. We were billed $6.98 for a two egg breakfast.

My daughter got the shrimp and grits, they where creamy and had a little kick to them. My younger children opted for the breakfast pancake eggs and sausage and they ate them all up. My party and I really enjoyed our food we will return.",

Outside of the food the staff is friendly and makes you feel at home offering their recommendations of food and good ole southern hospitality.

There are gold albums on the wall and nostalgic pictures of old movies that give it a nice look. We were seated within twenty minutes, which was great for the breakfast rush, but it took ten minutes before our server came to our table. We ordered our beverages before our meal, but the server forgot to bring us our drinks before our food arrived. I ordered the chicken and French toast. The chicken needed some seasoning, it tasted like it went from the package and into the fryer. The French toast was tasty and the bread was big, but the sides of the bread was hard and seemed stale.  Read other reviews before you try it, my experience may have been an isolated case and I will give them another try.",

I checked Yelp and found that most places were going to close in 30 minutes. I definitely wasn't in \"Kansas\" (read: Los Angeles) anymore.  The only place open this late on a weekday was Midnight Diner. And it was good.   When I came in I had a feeling I was going to get a great meal. The place was loud, bright and packed with a lot of diners. They were playing music from the 50's in the background. The ambiance was great.  I got the Shrimp and Grits which came out to only $11.90 (tax included). This was served piping hot and fresh. The grits were beautifully creamy and smothered in a creamy Cajun sauce that was savory and spicy. The shrimp were also cooked perfectly.   I LOVED the biscuit. It was brushed with melted butter so it had a beautiful glaze on it already. The biscuit itself was heavenly and flaky - it tasted like they just took it out of the oven and put it on the plate.  A perfect first meal for introducing me to Charlotte.",

    "text": "The hostess rolled her smug eyes at me because I did not want to sit at a backless bar stool.  I'm about to work on my feet for 8 hours so forgive me if I prefer a back on my chair.  So she sat me in the very back next to the hostess stand. Although the waitress was nice I had to sit and wait for her personal conversation at the table beside to be over before I could get a cup of coffee.  While ordering,  I asked to purchase a 2oz ramekin of gravy. (I'm allergic to wheat but cheat once and while) I was told NO. The only way I was getting gravy was to buy a whole of it.  So after ordering a breakfast including extra crispy hash browns I waited what seemed to be about 3 minutes. Presto my food was there.  Sausage cold and hard, hashbrowns petrified,  not crispy and cold stale burnt toast. I wait for about 8 minutes to be checked on.  I asked for fresh food not the cold nonsense that I was served.  With in 3 minutes came out my \"fresh\" food.  It was even worse. Burned, cold, dry sausages and cold slimy hashbrowns in a pool of slimy grease.  I sent it all back. The manager acted annoyed that breakfast standard was above the Midnight diners standard. I was still charged $5 and still tipped $5.  Ridiculous.   So now I'm hungry at work out of my $10.  My advice. Stick w waffle house. At least they take pride in cooking you breakfast, way cheaper and more delicious.  Good bye Midnight Diner.  Maybe you are only good for soaking up alcohol at 2am when people dont give a shit what crap they are eating.",

My boyfriend was there working nights so he and his coworkers had been frequenting it so much that by the time I arrived, the servers knew them by name. I wish I could recall the best ones name, however never did we have bad service so I suppose it does not much matter. I can't wait to visit this spot again. The food was greasy diner food, but well prepared and served hot... with cocktails. Works for me!",

I guess everyone had the same idea or just wanted breakfast before their evening meal?! I don't know but the line was out the door and on the sidewalk.  I just wanted takeout and ordered the Thanksgiving special, turkey, stuffing, greens, mac n cheese.  It took just as long for takeout as it did to dine in, but other than that the food was really good, just what I wanted despite the long wait.

The creamy grits here were so good I wanted to lick the bowl, literally. It was hard to remember what else I ordered because they outshined my other food. The French toast was good too. The honey butter is so good. Our waitress seemed untrained and kept telling us take our time, even though we were ready to order. When I tried to pay she made a scene, saying my card's chip was defective. I gave her another card and she asked me to come to the register and put in my pin number. She said it must be because my card was attached to a bank from out of town. I was a bit frustrated at that point and refused to enter my pin. My sister put the meal on her card. Right after my sister offered to pay, another waitress told the manager that the register wasn't reading customer cards. They took her card to another register where the rung up my meal. I think customer service and training needs to be ongoing for wait staff.",

    "text": "Desperation = Going to Midnight Diner when sober  Ever noticed a mile long line extending from a chrome covered building with neon lights, at 2AM? That's Midnight Diner. It's a combination of drunken millennials pouring out from Southend for a final meal before stumbling home and people leaving the always lovely Uptown Cabaret, looking to make a second poor decision. I've had my fair share of late nights here, which I'm not too proud of, so this is coming from direct experience.  It's all of the typical diner fare you would expect to see, only none of it is done very well. My drunken 2AM alter ego, that would normally demolish an unholy combo from Taco Bell, has been able to see right through the facade that is Midnight Diner. Laughable fried chicken that's either been over or under cooked, over cooked hash browns, those lovely neon yellow hotel continental breakfast-style eggs, and dry waffles. A burger is probably your best bet here.  On top of all that, you will normally have to wait a good bit to get in the door and trust me when I say, it's not worth it. One thing that has always been consistent is the service. They are trying to get you in and out as quickly as possible, which I can appreciate. You're better off heading South about a mile to Skyland Family Restaurant, where you can at least take advantage of the people watching and finally getting that unforgettable Snapchat story.  Prime location with an always boisterous crowd, long wait, and half-assed food...2/5.",

Midnight Diner looks like a diner you'd find somewhere along a highway in the northeast, but it's in basically downtown Charlotte.  I met some friends here for breakfast and loved my breakfast of a biscuit with two perfectly fried chicken tenders and a slice of cheddar cheese as well as the hash browns.  The hash browns were ideal in their simplicity of shredded potatoes.    And like many of my other Charlotte dining experiences, the service and value for the money couldn't be beat.

And the lot there charges $7 for 12 hours. Why not have an hourly system for when all the spots are taken?? Fortunately we parked and had waited around long enough that spots opened up in the \"free\" parking and then finally headed inside.   The Midnight Diner really has that old school Diner feel that I love. Their menu followed the same theme with a large breakfast offering and sandwiches and entrees as well. I ordered the chicken tenders and fries. The fries were really good and seasoned well, but the chicken tenders were not crispy at all and in fact we're kind of limp. I had to use a fork to dip them in the sauce because they kept falling apart.   For the price and atmosphere, I would definitely still come back, just probably would pick a different meal.",

Those grits are amazing, if I don't order the shrimp grits, I get the chicken and waffles and order a side of grits. I don't leave out of here without getting some grits! LOL You will regret it if you do. Anyway, the menu can be overwhelming but they literally have everything you can think of to eat. Plus a small bar. Diner food and alcohol. WHY NOT?",

I found this place on Yelp and people raved about the shrimp and grits so I wanted to find out what is all about. I must say it really lives up to the hype. It's made to order served in a large soup bowl and a biscuit to sop up the rest of your sauce. Grits were creamy and savory delicious. The shrimp was cooked perfectly. When I was done I wanted to lick the bowl so I didn't waste any of it. But I didn't because I'm in a public establishment.  The place looks like a classic diner, long a and narrow but plenty of seating. Even after midnight the place was pretty busy. The servers were very nice and attentive. I will definitely be coming back here the next time I'm in Charlotte.",

I thought it was odd that the \"buttery spread\" (I learned was not real butter later) would not melt. My boyfriend had the pancakes, which I also thought were bland and also had the spread that just sat there. I guess I'm funny about real butter and expected more real, homey ingredients to go along with the nostalgic vibe. I'm also funny about being cold. It was freezing in the diner, which also likely contributed to the unmelted spread.   I would come back given the proximity to my place. The best item I've tried this far is the chicken.",

One bite of these grits will have you asking yourself: \"Where in the hell did that come from??\" These grits are creamy, dreamy and steamy (if I could think of another rhyming word I would use it) Top that awesomeness with shrimp and I just really don't know what else to say.

Food order went in and it wasn't but a few minutes before we were served. I wouldn't say the food was out of this world, but it was exactly what we were looking for. It hit the spot.",

I'm wary about ordering veggie burgers, but it's actually pretty good. But what keeps me coming back are the scattered hasbrowns! With a side of toast and scrambled eggs of course, and its under $4! My only qualm is if you're getting food to go, check it first, sometimes the guys in the back don't pay as much attention to the order. If you're headed there past 11pm definitely say whats up to Maria, you can't miss her!",

The grilled cheese sandwich had cardboard for bread and the cheese was cold. The. The BLT was just as disgusting.

One of our group ordered the fried chicken and he said it was amazing; great biscuit and mac and cheese, too. Our waitress couldn't have been more helpful and service was extremely prompt.

I have \"skipped\" the line several times before to place a to go order bc there is no need to to wait in line if ur not waiting to be seated. All the while i had called ahead to place my to go order  and was placed on hold. I was still waiting on Hold on the phone as I approached the register to place my to go order. I was approached by 3 officers and was told to leave the facility and that I needed to wait at the end of the long line  to place a to go order. I was extremely upset but I went to the end of the line anyway and called back about 39 times. After the 40th time I called someone finally picked up and I asked for a supervisor or  corporate number. I was told there was no corporate number and then i was hung up on. Terrible service wouldn't recommend going here unless you were desperate for food.",

I've always been sort of a night owl roaming around Uptown in search of social events to keep myself entertained and I spot this retro looking dinner that apparently is 24/7 which is terrific because I can't think of a better area in town that could benefit from a restaurant like that (There was an older one back in the day near the CPCC central campus but it had to close due to that school's vast expansion) The appeal of the place was too enticing and I was due for a meal anyhow so I popped in to give them a try. It's not a huge place but sizeable enough to handle the type of steady traffic they would generate. The nostalgic feel is replicated on the inside as good as it's exterior. The menu offers a nice variety of what you what expect from an all hours place with enough breakfast & dinner choices to suit all tastes. They on the menu some different shakes & deserts that looking promising although I haven't gotten around to trying them yet. They also have some beer\\wine choices and they are willing to make you a mixed drink but they don't really advertise any particular kinds so it could be sort of hit or miss depending on what they have on hand. The food quality in very solid, won't blow you away but never anything that would keep you from coming back for more.  All in all, a nice diversion from the chain restaurants in the world  that is well worth a visit if you need a good meal in the uptown\\south end area!",

Don't you think if you saw you were running low Saturday morning you could whip some up since it is supposed to be made \"in house\"?

    "text": "Great Diner Food...24/7.....Slack Service!  Been going here for a few years now.  Up until this  year... I would have given it 5 stars.  I love the food but have to say that they really need to tighten up the slack in the service.  They used to have a solid wait staff that had great energy and worked really well together.   They were entertaining and on the ball!   Now it seems like they have twice as many employees and the service is much less efficient.  Everyone moves at a glacial pace.  When you pull in, you can almost count on the majority of the wait staff being in the back parking lot on smoke break.    The visit before last, we got there at shift change.  NEVER GO AT SHIFT CHANGE!!!!  They happened to get slammed and everyone got confused and in the weeds.  After 15 minutes, I had to flag someone down just to see if we were going to have a server.   After our order was put in and the food was delivered.... Our server never came back to fill a drink....and we had to flag her down to pay the tab.    I've watched food being auctioned off to the wrong tables, drinks spilled, dinner plates dropped etc.  It gets quite comical actually. No one seems to know what's going on there anymore.  This past visit, there was a table that sat right beside us and it took 10 minutes for them to even be acknowledged.  One waitress asked the other waitress \"Do you want them?\" (Right in front of the customer)... They both rolled their eyes and walked off.  Eventually another server stopped to help them.    I think management needs to take a serious look at how things are being run and even possibly reclaim some of qualities that their former wait staff used to have.  All in all, I'll keep going because I like the food.... But I may really have to think hard about going because of what I know is in store for the service.   Perhaps they should can the smoke breaks.",

They were light and fluffy and tasted great with nothing on them. The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the mac and cheese. Although homemade and cheesy it had no flavor/ seasoning.  But it's nice the food came out fairly quickly, hot, and correct.  The servers all seem to have great attitudes.",

And I think that's what makes it great, you get more than you bargain for! First let me say 'Order the grits' always! They have flavor and are so creamy. The first time I got the waffle it was good, but, tonight I got the French toast and it was great! the food is amazing! The atmosphere is regular diner atmosphere. So it's fast pace. Great for early mornings or late nights!",

I have been at least 7 times and half of those times have been orders called in for pickup. The women on the phone are usually pretty rude and rush you off but I guess that is because they are also running around to tables, either way, each customer should get the time they need if they are ordering, paying for their food AND have the opportunity to tip you. When you go in for pickup, you typically have to wrestle an elephant and do a handstand to get anyone to pay attention to you so that you may pay for your food which is sitting RIGHT behind the counter waiting to be paid for and eaten.  Great place to go for the quality of food and is open 24 hours. Will return here so long as I worked 5 minutes from this place.",

To change things around Our waitress Tammy was the bomb!  She made our experience awesome!  She got the the AC turned down and just loved her job.  Some folks hate waiting tables, but she loves her job and her customers!  After being with her I felt it was a reason we had to wait.  The food was good too.  I had shrimp and grits and a side of country ham.  We had a party of 7, and our bill was $80... how nice.  Those hot biscuits was so good... we tipped her well because she changed our heart on this place especially visiting from out of town.",

From the exterior, it definitely gives you the look and feel of a classic diner. Wide open windows with the hustle and bustle of many people coming in during the late night. Parking is located directly to the right of the building if you facing the diner. We were seated fairly quickly on a Saturday night with no problems. The staff was very friendly, welcoming, and attentive. We were seated directly next to the juke box which customers can pick songs of their choice and shake a tail feather if they'd like. Although, I'm sure that would be quality entertainment if a customer started dancing in the middle of a diner. Well, as far as the food, they offer a wide variety of choices from coconut french toast, to chicken and waffles, to desserts. I opted for the chicken and waffles which was I was very pleased. The chicken was crisp, juicy, and flavorful. You should definitely check this place out if you're in the mood for a classic diner. The leather seats, juke box, and fast paced service definitely helped. Can wait to go back and try the grits that everyone is raving about. Overall, good find in Downtown Charlotte that open 24 hours a day.",

What I don't get is their fanatical insistence on \"No Substitutions\". To be fair, though, it may have been our server, who was not very pleasant even when he introduced himself. He was clearly irritated when 2 of our party asked for simple substitutions.   If my breakfast comes with either bacon or turkey bacon, what's the big deal if you get a Club sandwich and request turkey bacon and ask them to leave off the ham? The server rolled his eyes, and said he thought that might be OK. When the food came  out, though, none of the substitutions were honored. I think that's ridiculous. I know substitutions may slow up the kitchen, but come on...  The food was good enough, though, that we will be back. We will just know to order dishes that require NO SUBSTITUTIONS.",

Our waiter hovered over our booth (his only table at the post-midnight time) and kept asking if we were ready to order even though he was literally watching us still discuss what to split. Only once we decided on the brownie sundae, which he had suggested, did he tell us they were out of some of the ingredients. Maybe it's because I really hate feeling rushed or doing things twice, but by the time I ate fraction of my huge piece of cake I really had no desire to return.

Nothing glamorous, just your average diner with average food. But, with it being one of the few spots in the QC open 24 hours, how can you go wrong? Automatic bonus points for that and more bonus points for them serving fried chicken and mac 'n cheese alllllll damn day! Can I get an Amen?!",

    "text": "This place is awesome. They're open late, the service is good, the food is incredible, they have it all. I had the quarter fried chicken (white) and it was great. It doesn't look like a place that would have good fried chicken, but looks are definitely deceiving sometimes. This was easily some of the best fried chicken I've had in this city. 4-Cheese Macaroni, tasty green beans, and even the french fries are good. Parking is a bit of a hassle but other than that you can't beat this joint.",
