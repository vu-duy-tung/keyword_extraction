    "text": "This bakery is 24 hours, and that is deserving of major brownie points. I think they also bake brownies. The breakfast offerings go beyond your standard muffin and croissants, and they have a very eclectic menu. I must say that I cannot imagine who would be willing to drive to this possible late-night eatery. There are bars about a mile down the road, but to drive here to have a drunken meal of muffins and bread is beyond me!  I went with the mushroom duxelle tartine. I have not had too much MD in my day, so it was nice having something different than your standard biscuits and gravy in the South, though I assure you Amelie's could whip up a mean B&G.  The open-faced fungus sandwich was awesome. The spread was rich and buttery and tasted exactly how roasted mushrooms should taste. The crusty warm bread on the bottom was the perfect canvas. Not much else can be said besides that the $4 tag is a great price to pay.  Amelie's provides you with a wide selection of baked and cooked goods, so I recommend you go when in Charlotte looking for something unique and convenient.",

    "text": "Amelie's is great!  I have been here so many times and am always willing to make the drive to get my sweet fix.  I have loved everything I've tried, with the salted caramel brownie being the only exception that sticks out.  For some reason it just didn't do it for me- I think it was just way too dense and sweet.  I love the eclairs, the little mini pie thing with raspberries on top (I'm not quite fancy enough to know the official name) and the apple turnovers.  Their drinks are good too- I usually go with the chai tea or the lemonade.    I have really only been at nighttime, but it is always crowded and hard to find a seat.  I agree with a poster below- they could take out some of the eclectic decorations and make room for more seating inside.  I'm not a big fan of the atrium because it gets so loud and stuffy but it'll do in desperate times.    This is a great place to catch up with friends, get some work done (as long as you have headphones) or grab and go!",

Ample seating, open 24 hrs a day, decent coffee and good soup, these make for a good alternative work environment.  They have tons of sweets, yet I don't think a single one of them is vegan so no good there. The bread you get along with your soup is animal friendly though :). The staff is all quite nice and they do well in the unique layout of the shop. Tons of space inside and out.  Their coffee is not the greatest but it's decent and I wish they had more options for us picky animal lovers, but it's still a rather nice place.",

Luckily the line moved quickly and I ordered a cappuccino and a chocolate mousse cup with a chocolate covered strawberry on top! Absolutely delicious! Seating can be a challenge as it seems they're constantly busy, but we were able to find somewhere to sit and enjoy our drinks and pastries! Love this place!",

Hipsters eat at Amelie's without minding the yuppies.  Yuppies eat at Amelie's without minding the guys who roll into the parking lot blasting rap music.  Rap music blasters eat at Amelie's without minding the squealing hyper college students who act like this is the first time they've been up past ten without their mom knowing (maybe its True).  And college students eat at Amelie's without minding the moms. The place is not just a French bakery.  Its a perfectly nonjudgmental social utopia.",

And of course always get a macaroon. My favourite is the orange coloured one. Cost should not matter, for it is worth every penny.",

I limited my goodies to a coconut macaroon and an apple turnover but will be back for one of the fruit tart things that I didn't have time for.  I would live on pastries if I could, but I needed the sustenance of a sandwich too. Any restaurant offering multiple forms of brie is obviously perfect, so I trusted them with something a little adventurous: brie, turkey, and cranberry relish. My trust was well placed. I will be back next week.",

However, the ambiance is definitely what takes the cake with this bakery. Yes, pun intended.  I indulged in the critically-acclaimed salted caramel brownie, and it was deliciously rich.  The luscious European butter used for their pastries certainly give a certain richness and flavor that normal butter cannot provide.  Also, I had the French Almond and Raspberry macaroons, equally delicious, complimenting my green-white tea perfectly with every respective bite and sip.   Again, the ambiance.  Two acoustic guitarists, excellent finger-picking, not so excellent voices, jammed in the main seating area. Classics like the Berenstain Bears and French novellas line the shelves, and a fireplace adds to the warmth of the lighting.  All in all, quite a comfortable area, and a great cafe to unwind after a stressful corporate day, one that I know all too well.",

I loved the Mona Lisa wearing sunglasses, there was plenty of room for seating and they have event rooms. And by all accounts (the way my husband and friends devoured their desserts) the food was great. The place was packed. As we walked I was surprised to see the line wrapped from the front to the back. I was thinking it would take forever. Nope - the staff was awesome! They had the line moving very quickly and were very friendly. Next time we're in town I'll remember to save room for dessert.",

As far as the delicious sweets go, they have a little of everything for varying palettes. Something light and airy or something sweet and heavy. Regardless, it'll leave your mouth watering.  If you're looking for something more savory, the roast beef on croissant is TO DIE FOR, and their soups are excellent, especially the french onion.  This is most definitely a place to hit up as much as possible, even if just grabbing a drink (I love the orange cream soda) and sticking your nose into your laptop.",

The BLT is a pretty basic sandwich, and I'm my opinion pretty hard to mess up, but the fresh bread with just the right amount of crunch and fluffiness makes this sandwich to die for. The vinaigrette for the salad was also really tangy and nice! At first, I didn't order a drink, but the saltiness of the bacon just made me order an iced jasmine green tea.

Yes of course I had to get one......and it was the last one.  I can't even begin to describe the perfection that I found in this pastry.  (My husband had brought me French macaroons from here before. And they were lovely). But my god the almond croissant. I will have dreams about the almond croissant.   And that's not all. Rebecca was so amazing helping me find the perfect drink.  I said, \"caffeine, hot, sweet but not too sweet. \" \"salted caramel brownie cafe mocha\", she says without hesitation.  Ok, sounds great. No, great doesn't even begin to describe how perfect this drink was.  Milky, smooth, perfection.   In the car on the way home (we live an hour away) I told my husband, anytime you want to come here. Just say so and we are on our way.   Thank you. Thank you for existing.",

I've been here more than enough time to realized that I've spent too much unnecessary time and money waiting in line to get mediocre pastries. Yes yes, it's the only French bakery in Charlotte that's open 24/7 so I guess in a way, you kinda don't have a choice if you're craving for pastries late night.   I usually just get the Napoleon bc I gave up on everything else that are offered there but for the past few times, even the Napoleon is not even worth the wait anymore. The price keeps increasing and yet, it keeps getting smaller and smaller...why?  The macarons are wayyyy too sweet. They're supposed all be different flavors but to me, they all just taste like sugar.  Their croissants are way too soft to be French crossiants. Where's the flaky buttery goodness that a crossiant supposed to have?!? Their fruit tarts' crust is too dense. You can get one from Harris teether that'll probably taste the same for half the cost.   Amelie's hasn't been the same and not particularly in a good way. Good for a late night hangout spot if you're still in college but not so great for good quality French pastries.",

All very good. It was all kind of messy but worth it.   My only complaints are dirty tables and the Napoleon which was very good however it didn't cut/break easily and the creme just kinda squished out when pressure applied.

A lot of people mention the seating but, when I was there on a Friday night it was getting pretty aggressive with people trying to secure a spot.  The pastries were great, and well I eat a lot of pastries so I like to consider myself a semi-expert. Luckily just as we were about to close up our box they put out a new tray of macarons one of the trays held a cinnamon chocolate one that I immediately snatched up and it was delicious. Some of the other highlights were the salted caramel brownie, pistachio macaron, and this raspberry cake square.    I do agree with others that the service isn't exactly something to rave about here. But, it didn't really bother me. I wanted the line to move fast and to get the pastries I wanted and the service did enable that for me.",

As soon as we stepped through the doors tonight, it was apparent.  The line to the cash registers extended past the entire glass casing of pastries and almost into the next room.  The bakery has an extensive selection of unique and freshly made pastries.  There are so many good looking treats to choose from, it makes deciding what to order difficult.  Fortunately, the employees are more than willing to help and describe the various sweets they offer.  I also noticed on the menu board that they serve breakfast foods, soups, sandwiches, and of course, coffees and teas.  I tried their popular salty caramel brownie.  It was thick, salty, sweet, sticky, and rich.  I could feel the cavities forming in my teeth as I chewed each bite.  The design and decor of this place is original and \"artsy.\"  There are a lot of handmade decorations, including the chandeliers.  The seating is comfortable and cozy and some of the restaurant looks more like a living room than a bakery with couches, coffee tables, lamps, and bookshelves.  Almost every seat was taken when we went, even in the atrium in the back.  The crowd was very diverse.  Live music was going on in one of the rooms.",

Things I do like A LOT about Amelies:  Ample places to dine with a small or larger group.  Parking is adequate and close.  The service is very friendly and not impatient with you while ordering.  The food was great and more than I expected! What I didn't care for:  Long confusing lines and inadequately staffed for lunch.  It took too long for what we ordered.  Looking around; that was the same for everyone looking impatient. None the less, I will return and try many more of your menu items, returning at a different time of the day.",

It's really difficult not to buy one of everything simply because you can smell pastries and chocolate in the parking lot. You're salivating before you reach the door. This place can definitely get busy during lunch and also at night and sometimes the line wraps around to the back door but it moves quickly and its worth the wait. The only problem I have run into is being able to find a place to sit with friends, but there is usually always plenty of room outside or around back.

The decor is very interesting which make the bakery a very fun place to be in.   The inside is pretty spacious with 2 floor and another floor for private functions. A very lovely spot for a hot sip of your favorite brew and some sweets!   As part of the tour, I was able to try the soup (forgive me I don't remember the name!) but it was so good. Very rich and creamy! Also got the try the infamous salted caramel bars. I guess it's famous for a reason!!!!  biting into the bar I thought it would be a HARD caramel but it was so soft and so good! I wish I had time to buy some home but I didn't.  I would recommend out of towners to visit and try some treats there!",

Amelie's is unapologetically kitschy, with French accoutrement covering the walls, tables and menu. The decor can only be explained as \"what an American imagines a Parisian coffeehouse to be,\" although any French person would die laughing if they came inside. But Amelie's recognizes its frivolity,  even relishes in it, with tongue-in-cheek art and silly t-shirts.  Amelie's pretention a la celebrite are the incredibly gorgeous pastries prepared daily. Cakes, tarts, honey buns, turnovers, brownies, macarons, eclairs, the list goes on and on. They even offer gluten-free and some dairy-free options, but do not offer any vegan pastries (super depressing to this girl). You can order individual portions or full-size pastries for an event.   In addition to pastries Amelie's offers a menu of sandwiches, salads and drinks that updates seasonally. A personal favorite is the mushrooms duexelles tartine, a fabulous garlicky mushroom pate (almost) spread over the most wonderful crispy baguette. Usually served with cheese (for non-vegans) as an open-faced sandwich.  Amelie's is a great place to take friends and family when they come visit you in Charlotte. It's cute and fun, with plenty of conversation starters, and open 24/7/365. Bon appetit!",

The quality is always the same! A lot of the pastries are different but that is because they are French and there aren't many places like them. This place is a godsend, the staff are always friendly, patient and upbeat. Don't be afraid to ask questions! Some things on the menu change and you dont want to wind up with something you won't like! For instance, the Tarts have a Lemon filling that my two friends didnt like too much, but I love strong lemon flavors so it being pretty tart (no pun), didn't stop me from completely devouring it. The minis are good. The Napoleon is EVERYBODYS favorite! And it's only about 5 dollars. The macaroons are the reason I ever returned. The orange, strawberry, and chai ate my favorites, the flavors change so make sure not to assume that the orange colored one is the orange flavored one! The tea biscuits are very good too! They have a dry area, with croissants and other bread type of things. They have a food menu also, there are many seats. And a restroom located the left side around the corner past the pastries, straight ahead. They are decently clean. The decor is tacky in a way that works but it is a little dusty. They have drinks, and the setting is good for groups of friends although the kine is usually long and kind of tight for people to pass by you.",

There were 4 of us and together we purchased two vanilla eclairs, two coconut macaroons, chocolate cream puff and raspberry chocolate tart along with fresh brewed coffee.  I thought the prices were very reasonable considering the quality.  I was told the salted caramel brownies are very popular.   The French bohemian decor with mismatched tables, chairs, and odd assortment of pictures on the walls adds to the vibe.  Definitely worth stopping in to give yourself a treat.",

I love their daily soup offerings paired with a sandwich, tartine or even just 1/2 a baguette with a spread or two. I also love the lavender lemonade.   This spot can get packed! When it's crowded, service can be pretty slow. If you hit them at an off-time, it's easy to find a table and staff are fairly pleasant and efficient. Fun decor!

We ordered a French press of coffee, chocolate croissants and an almond pastry, as well as a vegetarian (mushroom and spinach) quiche and one with ham. The quiches looked a little over cooked at first, and the cheese was a little too brown, but the flavor and egg was actually perfect.

Instead of normal ham there was fried bacon(?). Brie was melted and tasted like ordinary melted cheese and figs weren't fresh (write in the menu that the figs are from jam). I paid $6 for that. I think, it didn't worth it.  I haven't tried pastry, so I can't tell anything about. Maybe it's good and people come here because of it, so that is why not 1 star.",

It looked like the baker quit this week, but it was probably so slammed they just ran out of stuff!   However today I finally tried a Tartine, wild mushroom duxelles. Such a savory breakfast food, the salty cheese that comes on it and the mushroom puree, hits the spot on a place that otherwise only serves sweet breakfast food. Did make me want some type of breakfast potato though.   Also at noon some lady came in with a restock of Perrier, finally for the fancy sodas. I'm very very excited to try those seasonal sodas.",

Also try the salted caramel torte and macaroons!  They are open 24 hours and so lines are better during off hours.  This is a MUST DO if you are anywhere near Charlotte.

At first I wasn't that hungry, but there are so many deliciously looking treats in the case that I ended up getting much more than what I originally planned: 6 macarons, chocolate mousse cup, chocolate cake, and fruity black tea. The tea was so yummy! Actually, everything was yummy! I shared all those sweets, though, of course.   The chocolate mousse cup is definitely for chocolate lovers. The cup itself is made of chocolate. Very rich! The chocolate cake is on the lighter chocolate side and fluffy. I liked that the macarons were a good size, not like other places whose are so small that it isn't worth it. Each seemed True to flavor, and the cookie part was just right, not crunchy but not too chewy either.  I hear Amelie's is opening more and more locations, and my sister even got lucky with one in her home city of Atlanta. Now if only it would keep moving more and more south to Florida!",

The location in NODA is incredibly scenic and has a great outdoor seating area. (Pet friendly). It's not just a restaurant, it would be a great place to bring a date on a little adventure, chat with friends in good conversation.   The pastries are delicious.

Amelie's is probably the cutest coffee, sandwich, dessert, and hangout store. It has lots of personality with the decor. The staff are really nice and will help with any questions you may have and offer suggestions depending on what you like.  What We Ordered: - Creme Brulee || So good. They of course torch the sugar top of the dessert. This dessert is just delectable. Probably the beset creme brulee I have ever had.  - Fruit Danish || they are generous with the amount of fruits on this danish. It was very colorful  - Salted Caramel Brownie || this is a pretty popular item and has equal parts brownie and caramel on top of the brownie. If you're a fan of caramel, you will LOVE this.  - Raspberry Lemonade Tea || fresh raspberries are crushed and placed into the tea. The drink is good, but a little too sweet for my taste buds.  Overall, I am happy to find out that Amelie's just recently open another location in Atlanta which is closer to me. I'll stop by this location the next time I'm in Charlotte.",

No one wants to be pressured into purchasing the wrong thing.  I'm not saying that I need 30 mins to to make a choice but jeeze is like an assembly line.  They NEED to figure out a more effective layout of the dessert area/line etc. I'm sure it's possible!  It's hard especially when you invited someone thats never been before and they can't order because you either can't see anything or asking questions seems to be annoying to them now!",

So when I ate it it was either dry, hard, or both. I think this is my last time coming to this location.

I ordered the coq au vin soup which i was told was a hearty chicken soup, the croissant sandwich with ham and cheese as well as a fruit tart.  The cup of soup had absolutely no pieces of chicken in it, just a lot of broth and onions.  The croissant was a mess, one side was not the entire croissant, seems most of it felt out or got burned so removed.  The only thing that was good was the fruit tart as always.  As I ordered all to-go, I didn't noticed all this until I got home which was extremely irritating.  And this is not a cheap place!",

I moved in a few days ago and unexpectedly had a chirping fire detector at 830pm that sent my dog into a panic attack. I was so pleased with the customer service that the community manager provided me on the phone. She quickly took my request, expediting it to emergency status since it was after hours and put me on hold while she contacted the technician and got back to me with an expected time for service. The technician had to drive in 45 minutes away to change it the batteries (my ceilings are over 10 ft tall) He so was nice and even brought an air filter for another maintenance request I had put in for as well! Overall, I have never experienced this level of customer service at an apartment community before and wanted to say THANK YOU! For making my first few days here so pleasant and welcoming.

If you have the time, get prepared for good food and pastries.",

I ordered a Pistacio Petit Gateau (sounds wonderful, right?) It was horrible. Very little cake and a thick oily \"frosting\". the cake tasted very refrigerated like more than a day and it was on the stale side. At nearly $6 dollars you should be ashamed.

    "text": "After moving to the area, my SO and I were given the recommendation to check out this bakery.  We made the trip over on a Sunday morning. It was a bit of a drive from where we live, but it was highly recommended.  We got there and due to the early morning day/time, it wasn't busy.  After a brief study of the pastry case, we made our selections. Palmiers, a couple of croissants, an eclair, and a few other things. We took our items to go in our usual practice of eating at home.  The quality and taste overall was a bit \"meh\". It seemed like they didn't use full butter and cream that is expected from French pastries. Perhaps, lower quality substitutes?   The overall conclusion was that we've had better and it wasn't really worth the trip. The layout and decor was a bit artsy and a little overdone. It seemed cluttered to us, but take into account that we are both trained to look for points of egress in an emergency.   You can probably take the review with a grain of salt because I've been cooking and baking for 26 years and taught culinary for a number of those years and we've both been all over the world and had many local cuisines in our travels. Our expectations tend to be higher than most.",

EVERY single time I have come in here there is always a line of 10+ people.  Often times 20+ people wrapped around into the lounge area.  TRY their  Spinach Asparagus Leek soup Salted Caramel Brownie  Pros: Good quality and delicious desert, food, and drinks.  Cons: Long wait.

The interior is gorgeous. There is also an amazing array of pastry that was very similar to the French pastries from when I studied in France.   I tried the salted caramel brownie as recommended by others. I really liked it. It was interesting, crispy/chewy on the bottom with this delicious caramel layer on top. My friend also got one and didn't like hers at all.  All the pastries looked amazing. I would have loved to try so many more.  The service was not that friendly. I think they seemed really tired of answering the same questions over and over from people not familiar with french patisserie. Overall a great experience though.",

It was a simple enough decision:  \"Hey, we're here, and this place sounds nice.\"  We just had no idea what a perfect cafe experience it would be.    Their pastry options were top-notch, and their lunch options, while somewhat limited, were fantastic.  I enjoyed a crocque monsieur sandwich with a cup of carrot ginger wild rice soup.  Both were delicious, but I was particularly impressed by how crammed full of its named contents the soup was.  There was even a surprise sprinkle of pecan pieces on top.  Each spoonful was positively heaping with items from the first spoonful to the last.    We ordered an assortment of mini deserts after lunch.  Their pecan tart was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten, and their pumpkin mousse tart was perfect on every level (texture, temperature, flavor balance, spice).  The cafe was very large, exceptionally clean, and full of various antique seating options.  There are toile curtains and lamp shades, and chandeliers everywhere.  There is an entire wall of needlepoint replicas of famous works of art.  The walls are a lovely powder blue, providing a wonderful backdrop to the bright, airy cafe.  Decor is whimsical and fun.  It is unmistakably French, but with a sense of humor.  Shockingly, this cafe is open 24/7/365.  There is free wi-fi for all you laptop addicts, though I highly recommend coming here with someone you can stand to have a conversation with and chatting for a while.  Honor the French cafe spirit!",

There are two downsides:  You can see the employees making the food, and they didn'tt have hairnets or hats on, and they didn't use gloves; it's also hard to find a clean table.",

I was really happy to see varying flavors of them offered at Amelie's, even if they weren't AMAZING, at least they were there for me to enjoy.   The cream cheese pocket was delicious but the highlight was the salted caramel brownie. Oh god. Last meal wish: salted caramel brownies. Lots of them.   The mini pecan pie was good, too.",

Amelies has become sort of a staple in charlotte, with its kitschy decor, savory food options, decadent dessert and coffee/tea options galore. I'm a fan of the the mini desserts, because I feel like I can have a few of them rather than one large dessert, and you get to sample various flavors. Their chocolate croissant is one of my go-to items, as well as the vanilla cream soda, but honestly you cannot go wrong with anything on their menu. I also recommend the cream puffs and creme brulee, or anything season they have at the time! If you're going to savory make sure you save room for dessert!   Amelies is a great place to get \"lost\" for a little bit. There is ample space to do work there and escape the craziness of a busy day, which is always an added bonus...along with free wi-fi.",

The ambiance is super cute; I really loved the decorations and how there were so many rooms and nooks to hang out and enjoy your drinks and food or study. I ordered the pan perdu, a lemonade, and macarons. The pan perdu and lemonade were good but I was really disappointed with the macarons. You couldn't really tell what flavor they were (except for the coffee one, which I enjoyed). I've had macarons at a lot of different bakeries and these were pretty underwhelming. They were inconsistent also, as some had a higher rise in the cookie and others didn't have \"feet.\" I do appreciate this cafe opening 24/7, 365 a year and that they have seasonal menus (though they may not be serving everything listed on the menu, as I found out!).",

Paris is known for their delicious pastries and although this bakery gives off a Parisian vibe, their pastries are not very good. For some reason, they are all served cold. Their macarons are dense and kind of chewy. Their coffee is okay. And everything is pricey for mediocre food. However, it is a unique place in Charlotte to hangout and catch up with friends and it is open 24 hours. It is a popular place, so it can be difficult to find seating at the NoDa location.",

Located in a little business park, it doesn't look like much from the outside, but as soon as you walk through the front doors, you're welcomed by the smell of fresh baked French pastries and surrounded by quaint French decor. It's always busy, but that just speaks of the quality of everything Amelie's produces. I love their French macarons and mini tarts. I got an assortment of the macarons and a mini dark chocolate raspberry tart. All of it was utterly delightful! My mom had a strawberry, vanilla mousse cake (I can't remember the actual name of it) and it was melt-in-your-mouth perfection!  The staff has always been friendly and the line can get a little lengthy, but come and relax. Enjoy the ambiance, French pastries and a cup of tea or coffee.",

    "text": "What to get: pastries, salted caramel mocha Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: cafe, study or meet up spot Wait: 10 mins (Saturday 8PM for 1) Parking: shared parking lot  The Experience: It was around the end of my solo trip and though it's easy to secure a spot most places for one, Charlotte on a Saturday night gets crowded no matter where you go. At least all the well-known places do. So tired of potentially waiting for 30+ mins for even a spot at a bar, I headed over to Amelie's to have dessert for dinner.  This particular location is in a strip mall with multiple businesses, so it's a large, shared parking lot.  Biggest perk is that this place is open 24 hrs. Therefore, I can see it as a great place for studying late nights or getting together to meet up and chat with friends. To order, you'll likely line up by the counter, but it moves constantly.  A lot of their pastries looked great. I tried a fruit tart and multiple flavors of macarons. The flavors of macarons weren't posted, so I just picked based on color. The cookies are actually pretty fluffy and moist, even after a day or so. The tart was fine, but nothing particularly special.  Their salted caramel mocha latte(?) was actually the highlight for me. I'm always up for anything different they have on their coffee drinks menu and this one was well balanced. Mellow and slightly sweet, which made it easy to have with or without any treats to along with it.  Pretty cute spot and a nice haven to get away from the crowds at dinner time.",

Prices are a little high. The water station had warm water... not a fan. The decorations were not my cup of tea but they fit the overall theme of the cafe. One thing that stood out was a awkwardly placed painting of a strange little girl in the bathroom. Would not be returning or recommending to anyone. There are plenty of coffee places near by that are way better. I would recommend checking out the smelly cat coffee bar.",

This location has a smaller seating area and it was ridiculously crowded at midnight on a Tuesday night.   Had their veggie quiche which was AMAZING. I wish I wore loose pants so I could eat another helping. I'm getting withdrawals already! Also had the apple tart which was divine!   Had their chicken salad sandwich which wasn't too mayonnaisey and their yummy cream puff.  Their passion fruit strawberry lemonade was a bit too limonadey. Their green tea pineapple drink was refreshing.  Will definitely come back when I'm back in town.",

Typically you're bummed because no good coffee place is open.    This isn't one of them. Amelie's is open 24/7, no matter what time they will always be a macaron (or some delicious pastry) and drink waiting for you there. The service is super fast as it is counter service with wonderful drinks like Rose tea or rose syrup in random drinks. They carry wonderful brands like Harney & Sons (which to me is great). They also have a mean chai and espresso. The service is super fast especially if you're like me and you're counting down the hours for when you'll come home.   The art decor ;(sadly I have no pics), is very hobo chicish, old looking art such as Mona Lisa with hipster sunglasses, random shoes all over the place that remind me of the movie Marie Antoinette. The back has a tapestry or two and covered in art with tables and couches for you to study at 3 AM comfortably and quietly(they even have a quiet room)!!!!   Leaving Amelie's was like leaving a new place you'd almost called home, but alas I had a real home to get to.  If you're in the area check them out and try their macaroons, they're hugeeeeee and fresh!!!",

I don't usually expect much from a bakery, where the focus usually is focused on their baked goods, but the coffee was noteworthy.  The second thing I appreciated was the eclectic decor. Not just funky like some coffee shops, but interesting and odd while attractive & clean. There are multiple rooms, so plenty of seating. I saw a group playing a board game.  The selection of baked goods was beautiful and tempting. I tried the vanilla cake with buttercream, my friend had the cake with pistachio buttercream (that was pretty incredible). They also had a selection of macarons, financiers, croissant and so forth. Great place to end the night.",

Awesome location. Open 24 hours. Nice staff. Great place to come chill and get online. Some interesting characters frequent this place. It's fun to people watch.

Even as a solo guest you have options of a single chair with a side table or a table seating 6. Do what you want! I haven't even started on the desserts! The pastries, especially the macaroons are amazing! The staff is very friendly and are willing to engage in quality service (which may be a bit different from actual French restaurants).

Cafe: 4 stars Chocolate mousse: 4.5 stars Fruit tart: 3 stars Croissant: 1.5 stars  I consider a plain croissant to be the litmus test of a French bakery. As such, Amelie comes up short. The croissant was bread-y and limp, exactly like my local grocery store, not flaky and fall apart when you bite into it True French style.   Service at the pastry counter was great. The male barista was curt.   I'd say I won't return but being it's the only place open at 12:30am I might go for coffee and mousse.",

The decor in the bakery reminds me of a french cafe, but surrounded with random artifacts and pieces of history, like Cracker Barrel does with their franchise.   I HIGHLY recommend the fruit tarts (strawberry, blackberry, or both!) and the lemon and strawberry shortcake marcarons! They make them perfectly every single time, and always have different flavors to choose from. Next time though, as a coffee addict, I will definitely try their lattes! Hopefully I can update on that later this year ;)",

    "text": "OK, this is my first visit here and to be honest I was not really impressed. First the area around the bakery is a scary area of town. it is absolutely horrible with train tracks and worn down buildings and homes. I have been told that NODA is a hipster central but I really do not see it that way. it is not swanky at all and its pretty close to central avenue in appearance.  As far as the bakery goes we had Chesse croissonts, apple turnovers and regular croissants and it was just OK. There was nothing out of the ordinary with regards to the food we ordered. we had a major problem with the lady at the counter as she was giving our order just cold and when I asked her \" Are you not going to warm it for us\" she retorted \"Oh you want this warmed up\" as if a cold Croissaont tastes so much better than a warm one.. Duh..  Also all our food was served by the server in 1 plate when the order taker knew it was for two and a second empty plate had to be requested..  The seating here is also limited and it feels very congested as one of the tables next to the ordering counter are in the way of people standing in line to order their food.  Overall not a pleasant expereince from all the congestion, lack of good service from the questions etc and we were not at all impressed..  Since we live in the North side of town we would certainly not return to this worn down area of town to eat in this not so impressive bakery..",

I'm not a very big dessert/pastry person, nor had I ever really had French food, so it felt like a weird choice, but it was quite good.  The line was quite long when I arrived (1:30pm on a Saturday). While in line, you go ahead and order whatever pastries you want, then at the front of the line you order drinks/other food and pay for everything.   I ordered a spinach asiago tartine ($6) and a pistachio opera torte ($5). Both were good, but the tartine was barely warm by the time it reached me, which was disappointing.   Finding a place to sit inside was difficult; I didn't check the outside seating at all. The atmosphere is nice. I needed a place to just sit and rest a bit before I could go to my hotel, and Amelies was perfect for that.",

My favorite part of Amelie's is the decor; with all the  vintage/industrial furniture and dark woods, it's someplace I could spend a few hours studying, sipping coffee, and eating pastries.  In my opinion, Amelie's best baked goods are the croissant (and any variation of) and baguette. The blueberry and apple tart were disappointing, too sour and the crust didn't have much flavor at all.   I'll be back to try some of the other goods, but for now I give Amelie's a 'Meh'.",

I've been satisfied 90% of the time, but the last time I was there the quality of the macarons definitely dropped.   One of my favorite things to get are the salted caramel brownies, they're to die for. Matter of fact, I want one now (:  Cute arrangement and decor. Seems to attract a lot of college kids, but I like the atmosphere nonetheless. I always go pretty late and it's always busy. Very hard to find parking and guaranteed a line inside.

On one of the corners in Old Town, it fits right in with the Old Town feel.   We've been there a couple of times recently for take home, have had their Lemon & Raspberry Tarts, the Chocolate Mousse cup with a chocolate-dipped strawberry on top, and the Pate sandwich. Everything has been excellent. The Pate sandwich, a simple treat of pate and cornichons on a buttered baguette was perfect. Very light and the baguette was delicious. The desserts, as you would expect from a proficient French bakery, were decadent and amazing.  Their service is great - everyone is very friendly and ready to help as soon as you walk in the door. Their attitude shows that they care about their customers, and that is a great thing to see.  Rock Hill location is highly recommended (I haven't been too the other two locations). :)",

Great place for people watching and gathering with a group. I definitely don't understand the cult-like following this place seems to have gathered, though.  Incredible selection of pastries and all things sweet. But it's almost too much for someone like me- I tend to stick to croissants and baguettes with yummy toppings and cheeses rather than tarts with glazes or macaroons the size of cheeseburgers.   I think my main thing with Amelie's is that it is sensory overload on every level possible and I'm just not that kind of customer. But will I keep returning? Definitely. Nothing else like it. And besides- once you've tasted the caramel salted brownie you're basically hooked for life, even if you never order one again. The very idea keeps luring you back....",

I've lived in Charlotte for 18 years and have seen it come a long way and this is a nice addition to the city.  On a previous visit. I had a peach tart which was very good.  This visit, my friend and I decided to try the highly recommended Salted Caramel Brownie and a pear torte.  The brownie lived up to its reputation.  The sweet and saltiness of it made you want to savor it for days.  The pear torte was fabulous as well.  We didn't get coffee but my next visit I'll have to try it.  Besides the desserts, the best thing about this place is the funkiness of the decor - all the old and unique furniture and its a great place to people watch.

I will definitely go back to try some of the other desserts and see what everyone is raving about.",

    "text": "This is an awesome place that could be great with a few tweaks to the operation. There is always a line. And you cannot see the menu until you are at the head of the line. Unless you squeeze into the people at the head of the line to read the menu before you get in the line. Then part of the menu is on a chalkboard behind the other chalkboard menu so you really have to literally squeeze in with the people in line to read the menu.  UNLESS- you wait to read the menu when it's your turn at the front of the line. Which may be why the lone moves SO slowly. You can stand in line for literally 30 minutes just to place your order, so if you're having a meal might as well plan on spending a while there.  Seems like a separate line just for take-out bakery items might help things too.  Just sayin'. However, every single thing I have eaten and had to drink here is out-freaking-standing. Too bad sometimes I'm just not up to the hassle of going",

    "text": "The food at Amelie's is always amazing. I went here for a small treat-binge for my cheat day, and ended up eating two macarons and a tart with a double shot espresso. The macarons are great, as per usual. The tart left a little to be desired, and felt a bit over-sugared. The espresso, however, was burnt. I will not assume what the issue was, but I was unhappy with it. Owning my own espresso machine, I know the difference between a fresh espresso versus a burnt one. I saw them make it on the spot however, so I believe the problem lies within the beans themselves, not Amelie's.  Amelie's is almost always packed from front to back, usually with people who may have gotten something but have been there for hours on end. I do like the casual effect, but it does become difficult when you just want to sit and eat for twenty minutes and someone has sprawled all of their bags, book, and laptop across a four top. Definitely think there should be a section designated for more of that nature, so customers that are staying a shorter time can rotate tables out more quickly.  All in all, will go back from time to time for a little treat, but probably only to-go unless there are already open tables.",

Must come back because the mini sweet potatoe cake deliciousness makes me want more this second.",

Their pastries are some of the best I've ever had! Especially the macaroons. It's perfect for all hours of the day. Whether early morning coffee, brunch, lunch, afternoon snack, or dinner and a drink polished off with dessert! I could eat here everyday.",

I ended up going because they were open late (this location is open 24 hours!). Upon walking in around 8:30 p.m. on a Sunday night, I was surprised to see a line about 20 people long. Luckily, it went very quickly. Great staff, very helpful.  I had a blueberry lemonade, which was incredible... along with some chocolate/cinnamon macarons and the famous salted caramel brownie. It was the perfect sweet treat for a late night. They offer lots of sandwiches and soups as well, but I had already had dinner... I can't recommend this place enough!!  Moral of the story, if you walk in and see a line out the door--just wait it out. It's worth it.",

They had great flavor, but were so incredibly dry and old they should have never been sold and certainly not on display.   Unfortunately the salted caramel brownies were over cooked and the caramel applied to the brownie after it cooled- so it separated as soon as you started eating. Again tasted good but the texture and experience were poor.  Maybe just an off night but I didn't get that sense.",

It's in a little industrial plaza so if you are not looking you will definitely miss it. When I walked in, I was surprised at how big the place was. The ambiance is truly one of a kind, think of old french quarters. The employees are great. My first time here one of the staff members was with me for about 10 minutes giving recommendations.  The rumors are True: you MUST get the salted brownie. I also got a chocolate croissant too..... One word: amazing!

I had their iced coffee, too. It was pretty good, nothing to rave about though.  The only thing holding me back from giving this place 5 stars is the fact that they don't have as much of an array of treats later at night. Otherwise, a solid spot.",

Def give it a try, but maybe don't order the trays to go as they are quite pricey for what you get.",

They have a good selection of delicious pastries and desserts - I recommend the salted caramel brownie. The coffees are decent here, too. Never tried the actual food as I always choose the pastries over them.  There's usually always a line, but it will move pretty fast most nights. The place is usually packed and can be hard to find seating if you're going with a large group, but if it's just a few of you there's usually something outside or inside one of the many rooms.  The decor makes sure there's always something interesting to look at",

So it would be nice as a social spot but many choose to study or chat here.  Friendly & helpful staff.  Most desserts have the right amount of sweetness and some could be a little more sweeter.  There's a lot to choose from.  My favs are the tarts and lavender macaroons.  I liked the chocolate brownie coffee and chai creme.  I can't believe it's open 24/7.  I'd like to come at midnight and see how cool it would be.  I may try a deli sandwich next time or bruschetta.  Expect to pay $10 2/3 items or $15 if you pick 4 items (desserts & drink) if it's your first time.  I usually get one drink and one dessert so it's about $7.  Bring a love lock  which was an ongoing tradition at one time in Paris.  Read on it.",

My mother asked about the chocolate eclair- whether it had custard or another filling (she did not want custard) she was told it did not have custard but it definitely has a custard filling. Batting zero so far. The only saving grace so far are the pistachio and key lime macarons. They were delish. Overall, an expensive and very wasteful visit.",

I can literally have coffee and pastries 24/7 so that instantly count my attention. The decor and atmosphere are amazing too. I ordered a vanilla bean coffee, turkey and cheese on a croissant,  and a pastry. Not one crumb was left behind. BF ordered a BLT and it was the most fresh taste I've ever tasted. Wanted to order one after my sandwich. This is definately a stop next time I visit Charlotte",

Has a special handicap elevator for wheelchairs 2. Gender non-specific bathrooms  And so much personality! While it's VERY French inspired, the ambiance is really a hodgepodge. Sort of Paris, sort of hipster, sort of a lot of things!  It's a HUGE SPACE! Lots of seating throughout and different areas of the bakery have a different vibe. Never seen a bakery/coffee shop like it before. The bakers work behind glass screens so you can watch them pour batter in and out of huge pots, and it's super fun.  I tried their spiced chai and it was really great! They have an assortment of drinks and desserts. I didn't try any of their desserts after a heavy brunch beforehand, but will DEFINITELY be back when Im in Charlotte again!  We went Saturday mid-afternoon, and there was no line!",

With so many pastries to go and a few gluten free options, which makes me happy.  The fact that they stay open 24/7 is great.   They offer gluten free bread for breakfast sandwiches, so obviously I went with that. The bread was buttery and held it's own very well. On the sandwich I ordered egg, bacon, cheddar, spinach and tomatoes.  Everything was good until I realized they forgot my bacon, by then we were on the road already.   My husband had a croissant which he thought was perfect.   Coffee was delicious and we took some pastries to go, including the famous gluten free salted caramel brownie.",

The reason I give less than five stars is because of the fact that they got rid of my favorite item, the Marie Antoinette pastry. It was a shortcake type tart crust covered with chocolate ganache and raspberry jam on the top. Unfortunately it was a seasonal item (unbeknownst to me). Because I don't know if it will ever be back, I don't know when I'll venture that way again. Certainly if it was to return, it'd become a part of my normal weekend routine again to get a sweet treat.",

Probably just a personal opinion but I've steered clear of the soups and sandwiches and opted for desserts since.

I ordered this strawberry cake, which is a perfect individual size. I was super excited to try it. The cream frosting had no flavor. It tasted like whipped, non-flavored air. The sponge cake tasted like spongy, non-flavored air. The strawberry juice soaked into the sponge cake tasted like cold water. The strawberry on top tasted like a strawberry. So I ate a whole cake to taste a strawberry on top. Super disappointed. I will stick to sunflour baking company",

I think some of people's favorites are things I don't eat (breakfast sandwiches, for example), so who knows.  It's usually pretty crowded regardless of the time of day which isn't ideal, but if you need a coffee shop to work in past 7pm, this is the spot for you.",

I was informed it was 75 cents extra for them to scramble the egg, which I thought was pretty ridiculous. The total cost of my sandwich and small coffee was almost 8 dollars which is quite a bit more than what I pay at other places around town. When I got my sandwich it was pretty small and the croissant was so dry that when I bit into it it fell apart into flakes on the plate and was impossible to eat. Very disappointed in this experience overall. I did mention this to one of the workers and he did offer to get me something else so that is appreciated but I think they need to make a few changes with their breakfast sandwiches.",

Quite literally, because Amelie's never closes. It's open 24/7. If there were anything they do really well, that would be it. I have to say, however, that the quality has gone down. When I go nowadays, I'm not surprised when I get a not-so-fresh or burned eclair. It's par for the Amelie's course. And then there are all of the hipsters. You'll need to scour the premises for somewhere to sit because these guys have taken up every seat in the place. Can be a little annoying when you just need somewhere to park it for 10 mins. But no, you must inhale your baked good and coffee and then move on with life.    They have coffee, tea, sandwiches, soups, and plenty of sweets. If you get a craving around 6pm, wait 5 hours and then go to Amelie's - less people to fight through for mediocre pastries.",

We enjoy the atmosphere at the NoDa location the best, but Pineville is our closer option (incidentally, this location is populated mostly by women at lunch time and in the afternoon).  Aside from the pastries (which are more reasonably priced than most places offering French pastries), I like to get a hot, toasty breakfast sandwich on a baguette.  It tastes great, the baguette is warm and crusty and it just hits the spot each time.  I also enjoy their salads.  Amelie's is also a great place to take out-of-town visitors!  Ours always love it!",

Server 1: you should probably say thank you in French since we work in a French bakery. Server 2: oh, how do you say thank you in french? Server 1: hmmmmmmm. Merci I think.  Nothing about Amelie's is French BUT their petite fours & salted caramel brownies are aaamazinggggg!!!",

    "text": "As there are not many bakeries in Charlotte (so so sad, compared to my beloved Pittsburgh where there were 6 bakeries on my old street alone), this place already gets a good review from me. But, they also feature many exciting, delicious options, and no cupcakes in sight! Thank god. A cupcake place is not a bakery.  This place is faux-French, lots of cute, buttery-goodness inspired by French bakeries but without the price-tag and with more accessibility. The place is also decorated to the nines--it feels a bit like being in Wonderland. Their drink selection is great too!  Their number-system could use a little work. I've repeatedly had to get up and remind servers that I'm waiting for food, while they've already moved on to 6 guests after me. Sigh.   Be prepared for insane busy-ness at times. And--perhaps--because of that, really shitty baristas and cashiers. They can be very snappy, rude, completely ignore you, and then back talk to you when you try to nicely correct them on a mistake. Hopefully they just need to be retrained on how to deal with a busy environment, and that's not their natural disposition.",

I LOVE that this place is open 24 hours a day, not sure exactly why that is, but I don't care or question it. I recently came here with 14 other gals and quickly found out that groups need to be approved by management. We ended up sitting outside the restraurant in the breezeway which was fine with us, but good to know for the future. Awesome place to take friends who are visiting from out of town which is what I'll be doing this coming weekend.",

    "text": "Alright, Amelie's has clearly built a reputation.  The Uptown location along with the NoDa location both have some fun and creative seating.  The coffee and tea options are probably the best offerings.  I feel like most of their pastries are just mass produced, over-priced, lower than expected quality.  It is a fun touristy experience, but not a place I would go regularly for a delicious treat.  I have visited the NoDa location a couple of times in April and May, I've tried a few of the macaroons (and honestly, I just don't like macaroons so no fault to Amelie's on this one), the salted caramel brownie was gritty from the sugar not breaking down, and the brioche a tet with espresso & chocolate was unimpressive.  Take your friends from out of town for the experience, but probably don't go regularly if you live in Charlotte.",

I was so hyped to go here! My second night in Charlotte I had to go. I went around 11 at night, and it was pretty busy! There was a lot in the case I would have thought they would be empty. NOPE! The interior of the bakery was kinda over the top. with RB and hip hop music. I was expecting French tones. Oh well that's not the issue here  The pricing as okay... not a fan of the pricing on the little bits. almost 2 bucks for a small that can be eaten in one chew. NO thank you!   The tarts however were yummy, about 4 bucks or so which is what I would expect, in KC it would have been 5 or 6 dollars.   My biggest issue, the french macaroons. The cookie was made correctly, however the filling was not. It was like they just got jelly from the store and spread it on. And the creme... was it creme?! Idk, but it was horrible!   If you all every had French macaroons you know the filling is what makes the cookie. and I wasted about 12ish dollars on 5 macaroons in which I only ate1/2 of one. My gf ate 1 and we just left the rest in the hotel trash  Would I come back? probably they also have a real food menu too. I've give it a try again but won't be buying the french macaroons.",

It's conveniently open 24/7, has a very artsy feel/cozy setting and has a never-ending (ok, maybe I'm over-exaggerating, but you get my point) variety of sweets to try. I've heard everything at Amelie's is overpriced (I won't argue that), but the location and ambiance of the place still keeps dragging me back. Even the long lines that curve all the way to the back of the store sometimes doesn't stop people from coming in.   I ALWAYS get the salted caramel brownie when I go. It's heaven in a rectangular slab. Lately, I've also been trying the macarons. So far I've tried the salted caramel (tan brown), strawberry-something (pink), and pistachio (obnoxious green) macarons. The pistachio is my favorite!   Besides the food, I'm not really a big fan of Amelie's drinks. I have yet to find something that I really like.",

It is difficult to get the right balance between the level of saltiness and sweetness. I think they have perfected it. Their other pastries are definitely worth a bite.   Again, don't blame yourself for being confused and  undecided. Their addendum to coffee are interesting. Give the spicy mocha a shot :)  Bottom line: Absolutely French & Wonderfully delicious.",

I had a breakfast sandwich w/egg, bacon, spinach and mozzarella on a baguette, and one of the lemon cream cheese filled pastries.  The lemon cream cheese pastry was sooo good.  The outside was flaky and light and the filling that had the perfect lemon flavoring, not too strong or too light.  The breakfast sandwich was also really good, though I think if I had added tomato it would have given it the little something I felt it was missing.  My friends had an eclair and they loved it along w/another breakfast sandwich and the roast beef w/boursin on a croissant and they both really enjoyed.

Do you know how rare that is here in Charlotte? I want to stress once more the coffee is the best! Even the dark roast is smooth and not overwhelming.   I would have given it 5 star if coffee refills were not 99 cents. Should be 50 cents given the current state of the economy. Yes, I know the first one is free but I stand by what I say!",

The decor is a very eclectic collection of conversation-inspiring knick knacks. A must do in the Charlotte area!",

It's got a cool vibe, but I'm really not sure if I would come here so often if it wasn't for the fact that it's open when nothing else is. Perhaps I'm just cynical.  At times, I feel like the place is a bit too casual. One of the employees argued with my girlfriend about whether she had ordered a tall or a short drink once, and started comparing receipts. Fix the drink and then get into the technicalities, eh?",

The only thing that cost them a star was the fact that it's not a kid-friendly location and it has trouble dealing with customers in peak hours.  We received a number of irritated and impatient looks from staff, and there is little opportunity to get out of the way with little ones.  The large number of patrons also made it incredibly hard to refill my coffee, and the process of getting my food seemed to bog down given the high volume of orders.  That being said, I definitely plan to go back!  It's a wonderful place, especially if you don't have kids in tow, and the challenge with getting food is at least understandable given a) its exceptional taste and b) the crowds that deservedly throng to this bakery.",

Moved quickly but felt rushed to make decisions in order not to hold up those behind us.  Menu boards jammed, difficult to read.  Display cases attractive.  Enjoyed the salted caramel brownie (very nice but very small), croissant (not as fluffy as expected, perhaps to serve as a sandwich roll), almond cake (lovely) and coconut macaroon (best of the bunch).  The salted caramel apple cider was over the top sweet and I wouldn't do it again.  The french press espresso was so good it may have converted the non-coffee drinker in our group.  Parking is convenient in the lot out front (nice plus is NoDa).  Looking forward to the Carmel Commons location opening as that is a lot closer for me.",

I don't drink coffee, but if I did it would be here, because it just feels right. Most times I go, I see people filling out a Yelp review whilst there.   One hilarious thing is in the back room, there's like 17 pictures of the same two figures: one's a boy wearing blue and the other's a girl, in like a pink dress. Super odd, but I just tried to imagine somebody selling all of the paintings at an auction and the Amelie's owner bought them all. Who knows.   The only thing Amelie's lacks is one of those cliche French mimes, wearing like a beret and a black-and-white stripe-y shirt. He could be a waiter, but instead of asking you questions, he would just do his trapped-in-a-glass-box routine. Having said that, the staff are helpful and friendly, another French cliche. Is using the word cliche a French cliche?  Go with friends for debate or dates for a date.",

She corrected me telling me that drink is called something different when served in a cup vs mug, and when I received the drink from the barrista, she called it something different entirely!  Who knew coffee could be so complicated?!   The person at the counter spoke down to me, then went to chat with her coworkers while I waited. The drinks were not started until after they finished chatting. I asked for clarification on how many shots I was getting and she just did not do a good job explaining and made me feel like a moron.

They easily beat out any French bakery in Raleigh, and I knew I had to bring home as many treats as I could.  For breakfast, I had the twice baked almond croissant.  It was so crunchy on the outside, yet so buttery and soft on the inside; it was twice baked perfectly and easily one of the best croissants I've had.  I also got a latte, and it was very strong.  I love the design they put on top of it as well, a very elegant presentation.   I also tried the apple and strawberry kiwi fruit tarts.  Both were really good and the French cream was so smooth.  The salted caramel brownie was also amazing.  Salty and sweet, gooey and crunchy, everything you would want in a dessert.  The chocolate filled eclair and cream puffs were also classics, can't go wrong with either.  The chocolate mousse torte was also decadently smooth and rich with cocoa flavor.  Overall, everything I tried was really good.  You can't go wrong with any of their pastries and desserts.  Amelie's is an absolute must every time I go to Charlotte now.",

    "text": "This edition of Exited about Eating is back in the US at Amelie's French Bakery in the NoDa (North Davidson) Arts District of Charlotte. This bakery, that also serves a variety of sandwiches, salads and other specialties, is a go-to place to quench not only your sweet tooth, but also your savory cravings.  Dora here. You can say that again. Wait until you catch a glimpse of their dessert counter. Yowza!  I ordered the Provence B.L.T with Red Potato Salad and because I had no idea what a Tartine was, a Ham & Gruyere Tartine. The B.L.T. was served on a crispy baguette with loads of bacon, lettuce, and mayo that combined for the perfect bite, crispy on the outside and loads of flavor on the inside.  The Tartine is actually an open-faced sandwich. The baguette was blanketed with ham and melted Gruyere cheese.  Dora here. Talk about gooey and cheesy delicious!! We could've made a meal on the tartine alone! But we didn't.  The Strawberry Candied Almond Salad called to me. Because you know I'm all for salads with fruit, right? Yum! I added chicken for protein and my mouth exploded with flavor with the almost-sweet balsamic vinaigrette and the crunchy candy almonds. Yum! My only negative about this dish would be that it was entirely spring mix (Ernie calls them \"weeds\"). I would've preferred romaine and should've asked for the switch.   Still Dora, the interior is eclectic and homey, like a family dinner, with all sorts of conversations flowing and swirling around you. Can you spot my sweetheart in this pic? xo  Still Dora. What's up with the big guy? He petered out at the best part. lol. Of course, we couldn't pass by that bakery case without ordering dessert-awesome marketing ploy on their part, don't you think? The Monkey Bread (Ernie's choice) looks sickeningly sweet, doesn't it? But so not! So delicate, it reminded me of an apple fritter without the chunky apples. And that's a coconut macaroon next to it. I admit to being disappointed that it wasn't dipped in chocolate at first, but one bite of that chewy ball of coconut made up for it. Mmmmm.  Amelie's definitely made it on our \"must go back\" list. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

My personal favorites? The famed salted caramel brownie, chocolate and plain croissants, any of the fruit tarts, and the macarons. I've never tried any of the soups or the sandwiches but my friends have all raved about them. I would skip the house coffee - nothing special about it all.

Plus, I'm a now & later kind of girl so this lasted me for days.......  But my bigger lesson learned, was that I should reread my own reviews b/c I got sucked into delish-looking treats that actually weren't as delish-tasting as they appeared.....& then I saw I had tried them before & made note to skip.  Oh well, lesson reinforced!  Here was this visit's damage:  Salted Caramel Brownie - the brownie layer continues to remain very thin & grainy from the sugar - it hadn't fully dissolved in the baking process & combined w/ the soft caramel layer, the overall effect was grainy & greasy - will def pass on this next time  Peach Tart - looking forward to being peach season, I didn't read my note about there being little peach flavor & the 1st assessment still held True - there was an abundance of lemon & hardly any peach  Brownie-Salted Caramel Chocolate Torte - this was a new indulgence for me & it was phenomenal!  Take a blondie brownie w/ chocolate chips ( or a toll house bar cookie, if you will ) & put a layer of whipped cream in between, then add a small salted-caramel layer on top & you're talking 1 seriously delish torte  Cream Cheese Muffin - the pastry part was nice & flaky & crumbly.  More cream cheese would have made this even better  Sticky Bun - the caramelized topping had hardened to the point it was like a toffee candy.  Would have preferred much more goo!  Twice-baked croissants - there was only 1 left by the time I got there & the croissant was not crispy or flaky at all - it had been over-saturated by whatever liquid they soak it in before the 2nd \"bake\" so it was flavorful but not really almondy or croissant-like  So for the off-day pastries ( my unwise choices ) & the snarky comments, this experience was just an A-OK",

This next statement is no exaggeration...EVERYTHING HERE IS GOOD. You can't go wrong when the food is as fresh as it is here. All of the pastries and breads are made in house. For everything that they can't make in house they use only the freshest ingredients!     One of my favorite things...IT'S ALWAYS OPEN...no literally, they never close so you can wake up in the middle of the night and get a pastry or pull an all nighter studying inside or stumble in for some fancy hangover food. Whatever you want!!   My personal faves: Sandwiches: turkey and brie (wiring fresh seasonal compote, chicken salad and Spinach Asiago open faced sandwich Soups: All of them!! They rotate!!! Pastry: I'm not a fan of overly sweet so I prefer the cheese and strawberry and cream cheese croissants Drink: the best, creamiest chai in the world   You're welcome...",

If, however, you are looking for a seat actually inside the establishment and internet that actually works I suggest you look elsewhere.  See the thing is, Amelie's is a great concept, a 24 hour bakery/coffee shop/food spot, and they execute pretty well, so naturally they are always mobbed. The sheer magnitude of patrons cripples the net. Also, can someone please tell me why there is always some guy at a packed coffee house who thinks everyone needs to hear him play the same progression on his acoustic guitar 40 times, because I don't understand it, but Amelie's sure has one.  On the plus side, if you get stuck out in the atrium of the strip center where they have extra seating the friendly Amelieans will still bring you your food as if you were actually inside the bakery. I suggest just popping by, however, to pick up a dozen or three salted caramel brownies. Then you can take them elsewhere and eat them all in privacy while surfing the interwebs...that sounds healthy, right?",

    "text": "I have an obsession with well-crafted baked confections.  On my visit to Charlottee my aim was to find a bakery that fills my caloric need of yumminess.  Amelie's did not quite fill my yummy meter, in the sweet side, but the savory side they did.  First, the atmosphere makes me want to give it 3.5 stars, but alas decor can only do so much when the baked goods are not up to snuff. But I did enjoy that they have different areas with different styles, and an atrium as well for louder groups.  So first of all. My goto caffeine kick is a nonfat latte. Amelie's does not have skim nor lowfat milk. They only have whole & soy milk, and cream. That was already my minus 5 for me. What place that prides themselves of nicely crafted expresso not have nonfat milk? really, je n'sais pas.  Anyway, so i pulled myself together because I was honestly in shock to hear this. I actually had to ask twice to make sure I heard her correctly. they have soy, so I had a soy latte. It was delicious, but still.  I ordered a egg breakfast croissant sandwich with spinach and asiago cheese. It was yummy. The croissant was perfectly crafted. Not too buttery, it was just amount of flaky. It was not chewy from it being underbaked. The spinach was nothing to speak about, not sure if it was fresh or not. but the egg was cooked well and it was paired nicely with my asiago cheese. Overall, I'd order it again no questions asked.  I got 2 items to go. A lemon tea cake and a mixed berry 'tart.' Though the overall tea cake was delicious. It had a nice crumb and beautiful in color and appearance-- it was not at all lemony. All I could really taste was butter. Lemon zest please? Lemon curd? Something? And this mixed berry tart was more muffin to me simply because of the overall texture of it. Tarts to me are dense and buttery. This mixed berry were neither of this things. It was fluffy and I could not even taste the berry. When I bit into it, it resembled a muffin.  Pricing wise, I found some of their items a bit overpriced. But again, that is because I was disappointed. I have no issue with paying more if it is delicious and what I expected. The lemon tea cake was probably the size of a slightly larger square golf ball and I think it was almost 2 dollars. Meh, not worth it. I think the tarts were $4 and size wise it was probably the circumference of a average grapefruit and height was probably a little more than 1/2 inch. Again, if it was yummy and tart like I could careless how much it cost.   Would I go back to try other items? Absolutely. But I did leave wanting and expecting more.",

As soon as we stepped inside the smell of fresh baked pastry welcomed us. Once I saw the fruit tart I knew what I was going to order. My husband choose the chocolate croissant. I was pleasantly surprised when they informed us that they serve french press coffee. The interior is decorated in a funky and eclectic style which is n stark contrast to the refined pastry they serve.   The crust on the tart was delicate and buttery topped with sweetened cream and sliced fresh ripe fruit. There was a sweet sticky glaze over the top. YUM! The chocolate croissant was flaky and buttery with just enough chocolate in every bite. I will be back again and again.",

My personal favorite is the fresh fruit tart and a mercotter coffee. I do think they should have more flavors of coffee because the choices are not plentiful, but otherwise it's a nice cafe bakery. The atmosphere is very quiet and is usually filed with college students trying to do homework. If you want an environment where you don't feel like you have to keep your voice down, the downtown location is probably better for you.",

I had the Blueberry Cream Cheese Entremet ($5.89) and Raspberry iced tea. The cream cheese dessert looks like an ostrich egg with blueberry glaze on top. It is smooth and creamy, not too dense, just right. Crust is perfect, though there is not much of it compared to the amount of cream cheese. At the center is a dollop of blueberry filling. Great dessert. Super cute and super delicious. I did not like the raspberry tea. It is very earthy, but I would have preferred juice or coffee instead. I only picked the raspberry tea because I wanted to try something different. I also tried the Vanilla Eclair ($3.49). It has so much cream filling, I loved it! I was eating this in a warm room, so the chocolate started to melt all over my fingers, but it was good! Parking can be difficult depending on the time of day. There are several other shops in this area that share the parking space. If you love desserts, this place is definitely worth checking out!",

After a long night clubbing and eating too much cheese at the cheese and wine party, you tend to want something sweet at 4 in the morning. As big as Charlotte is, you'd think there'd be more 24/7 places.   Amelie's has always been a staple delivering fresh handmade pastries, my favorites being the chocolate hazelnut tart and the salted caramel brownie. The workers are always helpful and don't mind telling you what things are. And after seeing the lines wrapped around the building, they still greet you with a smile.   The only thing I hate is the parking, although it looks ample, you may be looping around a few times till someone leaves. This by no means will stop me from coming here or giving a 5 star.",

That's a good thing, as it seems they're always crowded.   Overall, there were things I loved about Amelie but some significant shortfalls too.  Menu: A French-inspired listing of sandwiches, salads and soups. There's a daily quiche too and really creative drinks like lavender honey soda. Five stars here.  Service: Though its crowded, the line moves fast and the staff is nice. Five stars.  Presentation: Just TRY and walk past that pasty case and not order a thing. It's not happening, friends. The devil's winning this round because the offerings are are beautiful. Four stars.  Actual taste: Sad trombone noise. For all that the space is cool and the product is beautiful, if it doesn't taste great, well - we have an issue. Sadly, my raspberry rose eclair was the size of a long John and frankly, was overbaked and tasted of neither rose nor raspberry - just sugary sweet donut icing. Sad face. The dessert stuff is all about twice as big as it should be but half as tasty. One and a half stars.  I like the 24/7 hours, the space, and the concept. I'll be back to try actual food since it sounded great but I'm a hard pass on the sweets for now.",

I'm a macaroon lover so I alwaus get a few while I'm there. This time i decided to try a macaroon icecream sandwich. Big mistake....it was not good at all. A complete waste of money. But if you love a cozy, whimsical place, then this place is right up your alley.",

If we are in the area, we will stop by grab a salted caramel brownie.  Guests in town? The napoleon is definitely a stop on the tour.  Awake at 2am and bored?  Let's go get a tart with fresh fruit on top.  These are all True scenarios.  Now, when you arrive... please do not let the line deter you.  #1 it is worth the wait, #2 these professionals know how to get the line moving.  If you are a line-snob, then just walk away and the rest of us will judge you for your poor decisions.  My typical go-to's are the tart and napoleon, which are delicious, but this visit I got the macaron ice cream sandwich.  Just imagine ice cream stuffed between 2 large macarons... yes, yes, oh bumpin YES!  The macarons were not as crunchy as you would typically expect but this is an ice cream sandwhich so I would assume this was done on purpose to make sure it stayed together as you eat it. SO GOOD!  The atmosphere is ridiculously cute. A shabby chic explosion of eclectic decor, this is a great place to chill with a cup of coffee and get some work done or just sit and watch the locals come in and out.",

I got their seasonal pastry which was spinach and feta cheese on a croissant like bread. It was delicious! My husband got a breakfast sandwich with spinach, portobello mushroom, and mozzarella cheese. It was also good. I got a lavender latte which has just the right amount of sweetness. My husband got a Honduras coffee.. made in a French press. They do not do pour overs here. They carry coffee beans roasted by First Impressions.   This place is open 24/7, has free wifi and lots of seating. It's probably the go-to place for students doing late night studying. Everything here has a French touch or reference to Paris.  Great place to visit if you're traveling and want to grab something to eat. Staff was nice and the restaurant was very clean!",

Walking in, you are welcomed with friendly staff and tons of quirky decor. Mismatched furniture adds to its fun vibes and makes an overall welcoming and great place to hang out, relax, or get some work done.   Of course, the desserts and other edibles and drinks are always a delight and the vast arrangement is extremely pleasing to the eye and will make you want to buy more desserts than your body could take. The macarons are always a classic and I have bought tons for a party before and they are definitely a crowd pleaser! The salted caramel brownie is a classic favorite and one of my new favorites. The tarts are amazing and the espresso cake has the perfect dash of coffee. They also make cakes when you need one for a big event and the prices aren't too bad!   If you haven't been to Amelie's and you live in the Charlotte area or you are visiting and don't know where to go, well girllllllll (and guys), this is it!",

Mixed berry, pistachio and whatever the purple was were very good. GF had the brownie and cake since they were Gluten-Free. She didn't die so I guess they were good.

    "text": "On my last trip to Charlotte a couple of nice ladies sharing our picnic table mentioned Amelie's as a must visit place for breakfast or sweets. After perusing some of the reviews I quickly bookmarked it and the morning of our flight out we stopped by for breakfast and dessert.  The shop is absolutely adorable. All of the tables, chairs chandeliers, and decorations are unique and fit together like a quaint, French-inspired, antique dining room. You have plenty of time while in line to pick out what you'd like and after ordering at the counter (and probably impulse buying many pastries) you grab a seat and put a number up to identify your order.   Breakfast came out quickly and all four of us had different breakfast sandwiches. The croissant was great, exactly what I'd expect of a French bakery. The sandwich overall was, ya know, a breakfast sandwich (bacon-egg-cheese) - nothing terribly special but still good and eating it with my cappuccino and the lovely restaurant made it a great experience. I wish I could have stayed all morning with a book and a mug people watching and noticing all of the nuances of the shop that are overlooked at first glance, but alas we had a flight to catch.  Before departing Justin and I naturally couldn't resist getting back in line for some treats - the only hard part was picking out only a handful to try. Everything hit the spot and this is definitely somewhere I'd like to come back to. What a great recommendation from the friendly ladies we'd met earlier in the week.",

It's just so much easier to park than the South Tryon location... lol (That may make me sound super lazy, but I'm okay with that...)   Let's see... At this location, I like hanging out and enjoying the vibe... It's a really relaxed place with a cafe type feel... I enjoy getting to just take a breather and experience the treats...  My favorite things at Amelie's:  - Caramel Salted Brownie:  I was a little weirded out by this when I saw the description the first time, I have to admit... Luckily, I'm making myself try new things all the time, so I was able to revel in the absolute delight of this dessert... Sweet and salty are the new little black dress... It just works. - Apricot Fruit Tie:  It looks like a long croissant with some fruit filling in the middle, in my opinion... I'm not making it sound as delicious as it is with this description, but the pastry is so flaky and the filling is sweet...  It is absolutely fabulous... Highly recommended... - Latte:  I need my caffeine... This just happens to be delicious as well and I'll take that any day of the week... - Comfy seating: It's not just random wooden chairs in here... And if you're sitting for a while, things like that matter...  I don't get to the area as much as I used to, but when I do get my late night hang out on in NoDa, Amelie's is a great nightcap...",

I was overwhelmed when I first arrived to Charlotte and I loved it, but over the years I have realized the quality of the goods are bit slacking.   By far, the salted caramel brownie is amazing and is always my go to dessert. It is never bad, never slacking, and always satisfying. Recently I have been exploring some other treats in the display cabinet and I am a bit disappointed. All my non-culinary friends love it, but I can see that some of the products could be amazing. For example the croissants are just not reaching the standard for my liking.   The employees are amazing, the location is amazing, and the amount of seating is wonderful. Even if you can't find seating in the main building, there is extra seating outside as well as in the atrium in the back. I have been at many different times of the day and always can find a seat.   I give it 3 stars because I can't get past the quality of the desserts .The food, however, may be the most underestimated part of the restaurant. The soup is to die for, especially the carrot ginger, and the cheese spread are amazing.   To end I can't forget to mention that it is open 24 hours, 7 days a week. It is an amazing place to visit with a group or by yourself. You must people watch at different parts of the day because the crowd changes depending on what time you are there.",

New to the area, I wanted to explore what Charlotte had to offer; she took me here. I instantly fell in love with the eclectic furniture and the smell of pastries baking in the back of the store.  The prices are fairly decent, service is great and the pastries? Delicious! You can't beat their famous salted caramel brownies, their delectable chocolate mousse cups with strawberries, and you won't find any other heavenly eclaires like they have. It's also a great place to study! I've gone there many a time with my iPad or laptop and sat there doing school work-- why not? It's open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and I'm a student! :)",

    "text": "First I was nervous they wouldn't have as many gluten free options as I would like - I was proven wrong. There were plenty of options.  The gluten free turkey bacon sandwich - was great. Gluten free bread isn't made in- house, they do get it from a vendor but it still had a great, fresh taste to it. You can order half or whole. I did half with their GF spinach, artichoke leek soup.   Gluten free salted caramel brownie was good. I think it could be split. Sweet. Rich taste.   Macaroons were really good. Mixed berry was a favorite.   Almond tea cake was gluten free - very fresh, highly recommended.   Overall I think it's a pretty good place to hangout at and have some sweets to share. There is outdoor seating as well. Affordable, & comfortable atmosphere.  I DO think their should be menus to look at while in line. I waited until I was next and asked the cashier what did she like best and went with her advice. :) lovely people.",

    "text": "I want to give this place 5 stars. If you would have asked me a few years back, it would have been hands down 5 stars. The desserts here are to die for.   Before I lived in Charlotte, my beau would take me here on my visits to the city. The baby blue, lost-in-wonderland theme was charming and I wanted one of everything on the menu. While it's a bit pricey, they also serve french press coffee that is every bit worth the price.  That said, the experience has lost it's luster in my past few visits. Amelie's was becoming well known and deservingly so. Every pastry I've had from them was absolutely divine. Who wouldn't want to come here?  Perhaps I've just come at cosmic peak hours, but the lines had grown to Disneyland proportions in my recent visits. The cashiers started to come down the line to take our orders before we were anywhere near the glass cases to look at our options. How am I supposed to know what I want when I haven't even seen it yet? In both my last visits, they also informed us in the line that it would be 30-45 minutes if we wanted to order a sandwich or anything not pastry. While understandable with the crowd to staff ratio, this was kind of disappointing.   The inside decor of this place is lovely. Lots of artsy kitchy stuff and cozy couches. However as busy as it was, there was nary a seat in the place. My last couple visits involved devouring a pastry in the enclosed strip mall alley behind the building. Because I've lost hope of enjoying the experience of this place, I no longer go to Amelies. Which is a shame because they have some damned good pastries on their menu.",

Add a cup of coffee and just sit back, and get the full experience. Take in the tons of small eclectic details and people buzzing around and you may just feel as if you're in a cafe is Paris!   Okay...maybe not Paris....but I really liked this place and I'll definitely be back!",

For dessert, the pistachio cranberry petit gateau and the creme brulee are very tasty on its own or paired with red wine.   Must try if you're in the mood for sweets or a quick eat in the city!",

The flavor of the macarons were alright (I had the honey buttercream and the mixed berry), but I just couldn't get past the hard texture. There was also such a small selection... I expected so much more.  However, I was super pleasantly surprised by the Salted Caramel Brownie, what seemed like the star dessert at Amelie's. I'm usually not the biggest fan of brownies of caramel, but the ooey-gooey-ness of the salted caramel brownie here was absolutely delicious. It looks like a very small and thin square, but it surely packs a big punch when it comes to flavor. It is super sticky though, so it's not the most pleasant thing to pick up with your fingers. Also, it's very sweet and decadent, so for the not-so-sweet-tooths, this brownie may not be the best option for you. But for me, it was fantastic.  Also, the ambiance of this location is great. If you walk along the side, the building just stretches super far. There are a lot more tables that I had originally expected and lots of cozy couches. Great place to do work or chat with friends. The couches are so comfortable that I even took a quick nap in one (haha, I just couldn't help it).  So overall, a pretty nice bakery in Charlotte. Don't get the macarons, but go for the brownie, and I heard the fruit tartes are pretty good as well.",

    "text": "It's a good thing that I live over 2 hours away from here, because the ability to get an amazing pastry 24/7 is a temptation that I would fall for way too often.  When we arrived around 9:30AM, I was expecting at least a little bit of a wait, but to my surprise we didn't wait at all! Maybe we got lucky? The only thing that delayed our breakfast was our indecision when staring at the huge case of pastries and sweets. I eventually settled on the twice baked chocolate croissant to pair with a latte for breakfast. The croissant was crispy, buttery, and chocolatey. I do not recommend for sharing, because you will want to eat it all. Or maybe I'm just greedy. And I couldn't pick just one thing to try, so I also got a box of goodies to take home and indulge on later. I ordered a couple of their sea salt caramel brownies, since those are their best-sellers (for good reason). And then I also ordered a chocolate eclair and a lemon raspberry tart. The cream in the eclair was absolute perfection and the tart had the perfect balance of lemon and raspberry. I really don't think you can order wrong.   The staff was very friendly and helped me make up my mind based on my love for chocolate. They also didn't get frustrated with me after I stared at the case for an inordinate amount of time trying to make my selections. They were also very well staffed and prepared to handle a big crowd that would likely be coming in for brunch.  The decor and seating area has mismatched tables, chairs, and lights but in a way that works. At one table it feels like you are sitting in a dining room and another couch makes you feel like you're in your living room. Since it has such a home-y feel, it is a great low-key spot to socialize or even study.   After trying these marvelous goodies, I will certainly be making a stop in here EVERY time I visit Charlotte!",

The salted carmel brownie are HOLY F&$K MY MOUTH Delicious but if you can fancy yourself a croissant, then you my friend are in heaven!!  The place is filled with charming, yet delightful and comfortable places to sit and the bakery is oddly large for that.   The aroma is seemingly constant and I could not find myself in a happier place at 4 am and filled with alcoholic beverages.   I think I even managed to order $45 worth of pastries just to bring into my ESPN crew the next day to indulge.",

The cluster of ooglers and droolers deciding what to order wasn't ideal, but some dude took our order and moved us along.  i just told him i wanted something chocolate and chocolate with some chocolate. Whatever he picked out was perfect. The chocolate mousse-stuff went nicely with my Abita Jockamo IPA and the latest episode of Big Brother. All in all, our order was like $13 for 2 little bites and two bigger treats. Thanks be to the Entertainment Book for $5 off, bringing the total to $8.",

If you want to make sure that you have your choice of the full selection of the pastries, it's better to go early in the morning. The evenings are the most crowded and they run out of a lot of items. They also offer breakfast sandwiches.   There is a smaller location Uptown that has a more limited pastry selection. They really need to  build more of these in other parts of Charlotte too :-)",

The decor of this place in a little bit romantic, a little bit eclectic and definitely fun (love the chandelier made out of mini pots/pans). I can't give it more stars because the desserts were hit & miss. I had 3 desserts, yes that's correct 3. The first was the best, a chocolate cup filled with passion fruit chocolate ganache: this was really good, smooth, loved the passion fruit flavor! The second was decent, a coconut macaroon: the outside was nice and crisp but the inside was not as soft as I'm accustomed to. The third dessert was a bit of a disappointment, it was an orange chiffon cake: the cake was quite dry, the frosting was too think for my taste. So I guess 2 out of 3 was not bad, so if next time I'm in Charlotte I'll have to try a few more.",

They also have great pastries, now of course, if you don't like petit fours and croissants, tarts and quiche, don't go.

I think the problem is that Amelie's is pretty much the only one of its kind in Charlotte and it's now too crowded and understaffed (or staffed with people who don't care?). Every time I go there is a huge line, dirty plates on every table and a mass of people. My favorite bakery items are the twice baked chocolate croissants. The last few times I've been they were either out of them (that happened twice) or they said they had them and then gave me the twice baked almond croissant by mistake (realized that when I got home) or they had them so I was so excited that I got two! - they were both stale. Really disappointing. Also one night we got a Napoleon to share there, we tried to take a bite of it and it was frozen. I should've said something to one of the people behind the counter but I was just fed up at this point and felt like they wouldn't do anything about it anyways. I just asked for a box to take it home to defrost.   I used to be really excited about going to Amelie's, now I just try to avoid it. I do have hope that it will go back to what it used to be.",

    "text": "Decor is eclectic and very interesting.  It has a hippie, trendy, college studying vibe going on.  It reminded me a little bit like this place called the Spider House Cafe in Austin, TX, but this one is more cafe/bakery centered. The layout is very unique with a variety of little rooms and hallways, an indoor atrium connects the businesses and there is a hookah lounge and small arcade across the atrium/hallway. Again very interesting lay-out and diverse crowd too, which makes it even cooler.    Went last night with one of my friends who has been there a couple times before.  She ordered one of the 4\" pecan pies and a french soda.  She's had the pecan pie before and loves them, and she let me try a bite.. it was delicious!  She was not a fan of the french soda though.  I ordered an open faced spinach & asiago on french bread, it was good, but I thought it would be more of a sandwich, so I would not order that again.  I also ordered a bowl of the pumpkin bisque, which was MAGICAL!  I would definitely order that again.  We also got a dessert to go and halved it between us, a vanilla strawberry petit gateau, which was very creamy and yummy!    Prices are definitely expensive, but it is an overall good experience.  Good ambience. Staff is friendly.  Decor is eclectic.  Food is tasty.  Fun, relaxing and quiet atmosphere.  Open 24 hours!  Diverse crowd.  Free wi-fi.",

Being a student when I first moved, I spent maaaaany 24 hour periods at Amelie's and we got very well acquainted.   I have probably tried almost every deliciously amazing treat they serve. Their sandwiches have always been on point and I, of course, love the salted caramel brownie, macarons, chocolate croissants, and my serious obsession - the eclair. I went through a really unhealthy two weeks of eating two eclairs a day because I was so obsessed and they are THAT good. To my excitement, they opened a small little express Amelie's uptown and one treat they always have are the eclairs - thank goodness!!  The decor is fun, there is plenty of seating, the people watching is great, and the coffee and treats are fantastic. I think its almost impossible to not walk out without a smile on your face, maybe a sugar coma too, but it's worth it.  Only catch is that on a weekend night, expect to wait in a serious line, as its clearly always the place to be!",

The balance is equal between not sweet enough and sweet and it results in fireworks... in my mouth, lol!",

Now it seems like their pastries are quickly mass produced, which is sad because I used to think they were the best bakery in Charlotte.   The tarts look sad with clumsily plopped on fruit and gelatinous clumps of glace. A lot of their pastries - like croissants, cake, anything with choux, palmiers, etc. are often slightly overdone. Overall, even though most everything tastes ok, it all seems to lack finesse. I'm not expecting Sadaharu Aoki, but a little thoughtfulness can go a long way.",

Bring a book, a lap top or some friends and get in line, this place is a french bakery with a maze of tables, sitting areas, and nooks for those looking to coffee, scone, sandwich and work, talk or chill.  I think the decor goes a bit over board in some areas...  crosses the fine line between shabby chic and TGIF in a few spots, but over all - very cute and inspired.  the concept is great and the pastry is amazing! The coffee is good as well. I prefer the french press to the drip.  My faves were the sticky bun and the macaroons.. and the turkey and brie sandwich.  It can get really busy and because people linger for a long time.. sometimes it's hard to get a table, but once you are settled, it is a great alternative to a starbucks or a library for those times when you don't feel like working from home.",

I used the wifi for a couple minutes and didn't finish the espresso as it was bitter and unpleasant.    I went in today to give the espresso another chance as they weren't too far off from pulling a good shot and they had been friendly.  The same barista from the day before was working.  I politely asked the barista to pull the shot a little shorter as the one from yesterday was over-extracted and a pretty bitter.  Instead of hearing an oh okay, sure, or an okay, sorry about that.  I got a very condescending talk about how he probably used too much coffee, and that it wasn't over-extracted as it would have been sour.    If it was only his incorrect explanation of why yesterday's shot tasted bad, I'd be going back to Amelie's again.  I love talking coffee/espresso extraction and would had started up a conversation about the subject.    He did pull this shot shorter than yesterdays and it was a good extraction.  The flavor of the shot wasn't my preference, as it seemed to be a roast on the darker side of medium, but the bitterness or astringency wasn't there this time.  Since he took an arrogant and condescending tone with me, I won't be going back there again and am giving this establishment a 1 Star rating.  If that had not happened, I would had given a 3 and revisited the location, as correctly extracted espresso is in very short demand in Charlotte.

    "text": "When I first read about Amelie's and that it was a 24-hour French bakery, I was sold. After my bf and I tried some beers at NoDa and Birdsong, we decided to pick up some dessert since it was down the street and were surprised to find a huge crowd inside at 11 PM.   The line was wrapped around the corner all the way back to the bathroom. My boyfriend and I were thoroughly confused and asked a group if this was the line, to which they answered yes and that they had been waiting for 40 minutes...and then even more bewildering, they offered us their place in line and left (they waited that long to get so close, only to leave?!?!).  Because of this act of kindness, we were able to order our salted caramel brownie, a chocolate-covered cream puff, and some sort of strawberry cream cake within ten minutes.   Side note: For a \"French\" bakery, everything was pretty sweet. Something I've noticed about French desserts is that they aren't sugary sweet, but Amelie's seems more of a French-inspired bakery than anything, considering their bestseller is a salted caramel brownie which does not seem very French.   Onto the actual desserts:  The popular salted caramel brownie: for $2-something, you get a dainty brownie with a thick layer of caramel on top. I loved that the brownie had a crunchy top, but it was too sweet, and I couldn't really taste the salted part. It was good, but I don't get all the rave reviews about it.  Cream puff: overall, what you would expect from a cream puff. Good pastry. I didn't like the cream inside as much. It was a little thick, and I was expecting something fluffier and light.   Strawberry cake thing (don't remember the proper name): it was one of the small cakes with a crunchy nut coating on the outside and a white fluffy icing and yellow cake. I really liked the crunchy coating on the cake. It was probably my favorite part, but again, it was really sweet and I think there was supposed to be a little strawberry filling inside but barely got any and I really wanted more to balance out that sugary sweetness of everything else.   Summary: Had I waited an hour for them, I would've been annoyed. It was a little too sweet for me, a tad pricey for what it is, but overall, I enjoyed my desserts with some tea.",

However, a friend of mine asked me to meet him there, so I obliged.   When I first walked in, I loved the eclectic style that was everywhere with the mismatched furniture that all just effortlessly \"went\" together. The place was packed and so was the pastry display case. My mouth was watering as soon as I walked in. The sweet and savory smells that waft throughout the entire venue are irresistable. I had the portabella and leek soup with a hot chocolate. Incredible! The goat cheese gave it an extra layer of flavor that just made the soup so perfect and the hot chocolate was real chocolate with steamed milk. It is the kind of food you crave when you are looking for comfort after a bad day.  Since that first experience, I do try to go back as often as I can. The salted caramel brownies are amazing and they even have the recipe online for people to try. This establishment really shows what True craftsmanship and quality should be like within the food industry and I always feel like their number one customer!",

After getting some sushi we drove down to Amelie's, and for a while I was concerned that we were headed in the wrong direction - the area was pretty sparse and industrial looking. But when we pulled up and I saw the cute little porch I knew it would be good.   The interior is artsy and adorable, with a touch of class. I'm a big fan of the various chandeliers they had and of course - the sweets. What yummy looking sweets, served up by a friendly staff. I got a free eclair for it being my birthday, and chose a big fat chocolate cappucino/rum cream cake. Then we had some french pressed coffee. Overall, I'd say the sweets I had were decent, not amazing. The cake was a bit dry but still yum. If I'm ever in Charlotte again though I'll definitely have to bring some friends to this place, The atmosphere is simply lovely. The best part? It's open 24 hours.",

    "text": "I love this place! When you first walk in it has it's own scene about it. Antiques all around, random art, photos of France... It's just all around a cool place to be in. And the food? Oh man! Heavenly! I'm sure you've already read in other reviews, but the caramel salted brownie is a \"must get\" on the menu. The dining areas are just so artsy and mellow that you'll enjoy whatever you're eating even more. Definitely a place to go if you're ever near downtown Charlotte.",

    "text": "Hamburger Cookies, as I call them. Amelie's French Bakery has some good ones. My flavors (ranked in order): birthday cake, pistachio, s'mores, Cinnamon Toast Crunch. You cannot go wrong with birthday cake flavoring in any form. It was the densest hamburger cookie out of them all and I loved it. I'm glad I got two of them as they were my favorite. Pistachio tasted nothing like a pistachio. It was the perfect subtle sweet cookie that is just so pretty to look at. This is one of the most popular sells at Amelie's. S'mores was more chocolatey and it was missing the marshmallow in the middle. I was hoping for the campfire style s'mores with your chocolate, marshmallow, and most importantly, the graham cracker. If they decided to go with a marshmallow cream filling and somehow mimic a graham cracker taste, this would become an instant all-star. Cinnamon Toast Crunch - the classic childhood favorite, morning cereal before school. This hamburger cookie contained chocolate in the middle, which threw me off because I don't recall my bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch with 2% milk have any chocolate flavoring. They would of done better playing it safe going with a vanilla based creme instead (with cinnamon?). Nonetheless, the crunchy cinnamon on the outside and softness on the inside made this a decent hamburger cookie. Becca was very funny and friendly in helping us pick out our hamburger cookies. Good energy in this very cool, unique cafe that's open 24 hours a day. Prices are just too steep.",

People before me and after me got their food, drinks and bakery items.  30 minutes later I asked for a refund.  Got the refund for the food, but of course she didn't offer to refund the tip.

The gluten free salted caramel brownie has become one of my new favorites, tastes just as good as the regular in my opinion . The team is also kind enough to change gloves when serving you gluten free items if you prefer.   Other all-time favorites are the pecan tarts, baguettes with honey butter and jam, and iced lavender tea. I haven't tried them, but I've seen Amelie's pushing these macaroon ice cream sandwiches which look very interesting.   Very French, very decadent desserts, very hipster atmosphere open 24 hours.",

    "text": "A dream for coffee lovers & pastry enthusiasts! I was so excited to check this place out due to all of the positive reviews. The decor, pastries, & coffee were fantastic! I would highly recommend Amelie's to anyone in the Charlotte area.   First off, the decor is AWESOME! You literally feel like you have stepped into Paris as soon as you walk through the door. There are murals of the Eiffel Tower, the Mona Lisa, & locks along the gate at the front depicting the Pont des Arts bridge in Paris.   There is also plenty of spaces to sit. They have a large back room with couches, tables, chairs, & a front area with the same setup. Even on the busiest of days, I can always snag a chair or two!   Now for the good stuff.... the coffee & pastries! My first visit included a lavender coconut cream latte & a strawberry & cream cheese danish. That danish was absolutely delicious! I would order it again in a heartbeat. The lavender coconut cream latte was good. I'm not a huge fan of coconut, but LOVE lavender so I had to give it a try!   My second visit consisted of a fresh fruit danish & the chai creme. The fresh fruit danish was so yummy! I could have eaten an endless amount of those heavenly things. The chai creme was my favorite coffee that I ordered out of all of my visits. I would highly recommend this coffee item.   During my third visit, I ordered a vanilla almond milk latte & a blueberry cream cheese muffin. Once again, the pastry did not disappoint! The muffin was moist, flavorful, & filling (the perfect combo). The vanilla almond milk latte was pretty darn good as well. I would definitely order it again.   This is the perfect spot to grab a cup of coffee, read your favorite book, or work on school stuff. They are open 24 hours, which is awesome for people in school! If you haven't checked out Amelie's, please stop what you are doing & drive there immediately. It will leave you wanting more!",

Well, Amelie's was definitely 5-stars both times and I can definitely see this place being my new late night Crown Town hang out!  First off, this place is like a museum with all sorts of weird, quirky, and fun decor! The back room especially feels like the living room of a close friend if they were a hip hoarder of chic, contemporary, and collectible french-themed tchotchkes.   Second, their menu is just stellar and oddly not that overpriced, especially for the NoDa area.   Third, they are open 24/7! Recently, I was locked out of my place and had to find somewhere to chill from 4:30am-7am...Amelies to the rescue! Not only did I have the comfy couch all to myself, but I curled up on it w/my phone connected to their free wifi and easily killed 2.5hrs into the dawn w/a delectable lavender coconut creme cafe and bacon brie tartine.   The staff can be a little hit or miss, but for the most part, they are friendly and informative if you have a question about a menu item.  Service is counter and they will give you a number to bring your food items out to you, but you pick up any coffee/tea orders at the counter. They do have a separate place to order from the bakery/pastry case (haven't tried anything from there yet because I am afraid to unleash that beast, but it will probably happen on my next visit).  Their bfast croissant are fantastic and their shot in the dark (drip + espresso shot) passed my palate.   Being a new transplant from Austin (a city that is almost too cool for itself), this place totally felt like home and I can't wait to have an excuse and some disposable income to come back as soon and as often as possible!",

I also enjoyed the eclectic vibe and the borderline messy decorations. Since my first visit I've eaten here four times and each visit has been worse and worse.  I expect a French bakery to have amazing macarons and I've given up on theirs. On my first visit i had an amazing pistachio macaron, that was maybe 3 years ago. The last two times the macarons were really bad. They were crunchy and seemed stale. If you're a macaron obsessed freak like me you know they're supposed to be soft and almost melt in your mouth. These were like crackers.  My meal was great, but my partner's was not. Her salad was wilted and when she asked for more dressing with salt and pepper the waiter acted like he was offended to be asked for anything.  I'm still voting 4 stars because other deserts are good and my meals are always fine but it seems there's been a change in staffing and recipes? I just want my GOOD macarons back!",

I got the blueberry cream cheese muffin and had it warmed. It was perfection. There was an oat-cinnamon-brown sugar-pecan topping that was a wonderful compliment to the warm muffin.   Amelie's is a perfect spot for a quick friend meet up, work planing meeting or part of a date night.",

The actual confectioneries though were unmemorable.  Mini Peach Tart - best dessert of the lot, not too sweet yet satisfies. Napoleon - frozen cream, beautiful, delicate pastry Salted Caramel Brownie - incredibly dense, one bite is enough! Petit Gateau chocolate - thick frosting with unmemorable chocolate cake Eclair - fine, if you're about eclairs Petit Fours - pistachio, chocolate peanut butter (x2), lemon, tasty if you're looking for a one bite dessert Mixed berry, strawberry, chocolate cinnamon macarons - only the mixed berry was fresh at the time, the strawberry and chocolate cinnamon were stale.  Quick service, nice people, only fresh juice available is lemonade, the rest is store bought. Lovely indoor and outdoor seating. Plenty of parking.",

You can expect to pay like over $2.50 for everything. Can't go wrong with their macaroons either! Decently sized and never tasted one I didn't like (always have several flavors at least). The tarts are good, several options there. We have tried cake once and wasn't impressed at all, so I recommend sticking to the SCB or macaroons, or tarts. Not the mention the cakes are $5ish. There's usually a long line so be prepared to wait, it usually moves at a decent pace. Giving 4 stars for the lines and the higher price (but worth it ). Place is decently sized but usually so popping can be challenging to find a seat sometimes.",

Plus, we always have those late night cravings anyway. So, good thing this one is open 24/7. I almost feel sorry for the third shift staff. They're always friendly and funny though. My friends and I always end up striking a conversation with them. I usually walk out with some macaroons, they're my kryptonite! I love the lemon, orange, and mix berry. I love that every time we come in the regular stuff is still there, but they always have something different to try. I'm not really a coffee or tea drinker. All my friends are and they enjoy the drinks from this place. I personally LOVE the hot chocolate though. It's dark chocolate which is basically the only way hot chocolate should be made. Don't try to sell me on milk chocolate it taste like dirty water. There is also plenty of seats! the cafe just seems to keep going and going just when you thought you hit a wall. Overall nice aesthetics, good food, nice staff, and decent WiFi. Perfect little cafe.",

Since I am a remote employee, I often claim this as my office for the day and I'm always able to get a lot done while enjoying a sweet delight from a variety of pastries or a savory selection of sandwiches, quiches, or salads.  I love the variety of beverages as well- everything from coffee, bottled drinks, refreshing lemonades and teas.  My ultimate favorites are the salted caramel brownie, pecan sticky bun, palmier, lemon cream cheese pocket, or a pecan tart.  My friends often rave about the macaroons, but I'll take their word for it as I'm not a fan of any type of macaroons.  Word of advice, usually around Thursday- Saturday nights are the busiest and the line is usually wrapped around into the sitting area.  If you're unable to find a seat, you can also sit anywhere in the common area outside of the bakery.",

And trust that anything you pick will not disappoint. There breakfast sandwiches are top notch with the best croissants I've had ever and amazing fresh ingredients. The best part is there's many coffee options and if your not sure they will recommend exactly what your thinking and it's perfect.",

It is just mediocre and getting very overpriced.   From my last visit, they had the ingredients for 1/3 of the items I ordered. One ran out after I paid and instead of offering me a refund sat there and rattled off substitutes till I agreed. It was just uncomfortable. I left the food on the table anyway, it wasn't good and it wasn't what I wanted.",

I fell in love with fruit tarts, macaroons, baguettes, crepes, and croissants when I first visited Paris at 19.  Amelie does all of those things justice.  I'm ashamed to say I've tried all of those items in only two trips to Amelie's when I was in town visiting friends (Who needs to fit into a wedding dress anyhow?).  However, we are moving to Charlotte and I can't wait for this bakery to become a staple of my sometimes very terrible diet.  They have plenty of places to sit, a beautiful display case, good drinks and sandwiches and plenty of places to park.  Charlotte needs more places like Amelie's.",

Let me first start off by saying there aren't many places around Charlotte where you can just meet up with your friends and chill.  This places gives you that viable option.  The convenience of a 24 hours bakery is a great idea where you can meet up if you still wanna chill after the bars and clubs.    This place is pretty fancy with discrete furniture decor and artsy decorations.  Now if were talking about the environment and ambiance of this place, i would give it a thumbs up. If were talking about the quality of food, i would say it is okay.  I've had many of the desserts here from the fruit tarts to the macaroons.  To summarize the food choices here i would say its not the freshest.  I hate to bash this place but the food is just alright.  Im more use to a softer crust macroons but these are just a bit on the hard side.  Would i still come here agian? Absolutely.",

I didn't understand that it was a private rental only space. There were no signs. Her response was \"Well it is normally rented for 100$ an hour but I guess since you need someplace to sit we will open it just for YOU.\" ----- Seriously?!?!  And they are constantly in the news for their horrible practices in dealing with the back of the house employees. Like requiring them to work 60 hrs a week but having them clock out after 40 and then back in under another title so that they won't have to pay time and a half. I have spoken with some x employees that have confirmed that and worse.   So the food is decent though crazy expensive and the ambiance is frilly and french. But don't think that you are supporting a positive local business. I can do without the salted caramel brownies to sleep better at night",

I chose the croissant for bread, the turkey for meat, and mozzarella for cheese. Although the sandwich was not filling and there was not an opportunity to order anything with it other than French pastries, I could not complain.  Everything was fresh, and I spent $9.00 including my bottle water.    The atmosphere was quirky and no two things seem to match which emphasized the quirkiness.  The lady who served the pastries was well-educated about the pastries, friendly, and full of \"I love my job\" kind of energy. By the time I arrived with my party of three at 11:08 pm, the line had snaked to the back of the establishment. Even though the line was rather intimidating, it moved fairly quickly, and that was impressive to me. When my turkey and mozzarella croissant was ready, a server was calmly walking around looking for me.  Once again, impressed.    Final thoughts:  I will go back the next time I am visiting in Charlotte, NC.",

    "text": "Amelie's is the kind of place that you're still surprised to find in Charlotte. (We're cooler now than we've ever been with our craft beer and our trendy 'hoods, but Amelie's is still a standout that makes you say, \"Whoa. We're THAT cool? Really?\" The main location is open 24 hours and every ounce of its staff and decor oozes hipster cool. But it's the pastries that keep people coming back. (They're so good it wouldn't matter if they were served in a bunker. As it is, you'll get to enjoy tasty pastries paired with deliciously quirky ambiance.)  You can't go wrong. The salted caramel brownies are a known, rich favorite. The Napoleon can't be beat. Their tarts are delectable. Their macaron selection renowned. I recently brought an old friend from college by for the first time. She's an art history professor who travels the world. She not only got a huge kick out of the decor's riffs on classic masterpieces, but she said the macaron she had was one of the best she's had - worldwide - and well worth the line.   Prices aren't cheap if you're looking to load up and buy a box or two of treats, but cheap isn't what you're here for anyway. The NoDa location can feel a little dirty, as noted in another review, but I imagine that's par for the course with anything that's open 24 hours. There can be a wait, but it moves quickly and is worth it. I haven't had lunch here, but often salivate over their Facebook soup of the day posts. Swing on by, bring an out-of-towner or two to show just how cool the QC is, and respect the pastries because holy moly they're delish.",

However, unlike other favorite NoDa spots, Amelies has a private parking lot.  And, I do appreciate that since I was towed once having dinner at Cabo Fish Taco, but I digress.  Highlights: open 24 hours a day, free wi-fi access, amazing pastries, delicious sandwiches if you're a tad more hungry, and some great coffees!  Perhaps I'm most appreciative of the oversized, comfy couches and chairs located toward the back of the bakery.  I just melt right into them and then don't want to do any school work which is usually my intent when I make the trek into visit.    The staff have always been very friendly.  However, I'm not totally clear on whether you are supposed to leave your dishes behind or find one of those dishes buckets and put things away yourself.  I get the sense that either is acceptable.  The art work, antiques, piano and other trinkets are always fun to look at!  I'd recommend coming to Amelie's for: 1) some after bar hopping treats, 2) a place to bunker in and do some work with the free wi-fi and pastries, and 3) the dessert ending to a perfect date!",

It being 24x7 operational, adds more value to itself. My fav are the most familiar Salted Caramel Brownie, chocolate gateaux, chicken salad sandwich, almond cake (to die for), and Chai tea latte. This is the first place where we tried Chai tea latte with soy milk and that taste has become a standard.  The ambience for sure gives you a French feel or at least you will learn the French taste. Friday and Saturday late nights are always pretty crowded as lot of people come here for their favorite bites after party. With wifi it's a great place to work/study as well. A must go in Charlotte if you like pastries :)",

Stop in and pick up some sweets from their bakery, or bring a book or a friend and settle in with their wonderful french press coffee. Even if the line appears long when you first walk in, don't be intimidated because their treats and coffee are well worth the wait. The service is excellent, the aesthetic is original and vaguely dadaist, and the atmosphere is very pleasant. If you're in the Charlotte area, stop in soon because Amelie's will probably become your new favorite place for a Sunday afternoon.",

My advice for the best croissant in the area, go to The Fresh Market. (And that is the only reason to go to The Fresh Market.) Although the product comes in frozen (I know, I know) at TFM, when they are baked just right, they are excellent. Some blueberry preserves smeared on it and I'm happy... I did try some pastries at Amelie's but nothing to write home about. I tried a baguette and it was edible. I still can do better pastries and bread in my galley kitchen.

Sandwiches are tasty but somewhat smallish. The salted caramel brownie is a favorite and baguettes are perfect.   Ambiance & Atmosphere: kitschy bordering on trying too hard, noisy, & the layout leaves the ordering line blocking the display cases so it can be difficult to have time to shop the offerings when the counter help is asking for your order right when you first see the contents du jour.

For me, this place began as a perfect spot because I was always looking for something that was open late and the early hours of the morning.  But due to the hype and popularity of this place, the quality has definitely gone downhill from the fond memories I originally made here.   Many of their breads are now sold frozen and I even received a Neapolitan that was rock hard in the middle making it un-edible because  it had been frozen.   This place does still serve a purpose for me when I'm looking for something because no other places open; however, with the long lines you find later on in the evening it often feels more like a nightclub than a bakery serving great food.  To put it simply, the best thing about this place is that it's open 24/7.",

I like it cuz it doesn't look like every other damn place in town.  Savory food - like it. The sandwiches are AMAZING, as is the quiche. The salad choices are fine, but they don't really do anything that would be considered an entree.  Bakery - Also like it. Everything Amelie's does is wonderful. You are *required* to try the chocolate torte sometime before you die. There is no option here. The twice-baked croissant makes me masticate just thinking about it. The tea cakes are om-nom-arrific. The French macarons are excellent. However, Amelie's commits a major cardinal sin here that I simply can't avoid writing about: THEY LEAVE THE FRENCH MACARONS IN THE FRIDGE ALL DAY, MAKING THEM HARD AND CRUNCHY. I mean, seriously, who the FUCK decided this was a good idea?! Have they never had real macarons before?! Now, I know what you're thinking: \"Aubrey, not *everybody* knows how a macaron should taste.\" That's True, gentle reader, but if you're going to fucking make macarons for people to purchase and consume, you should know how they're stored / kept fresh. Any other way, and you might as well hold your glaring deficiencies out for the world to see. In this case, Amelie's is walking around with a hideous facial birthmark.  Coffee - meh. Ees okay. Not great. The melange riche is burnt-tasting, while the house roast is better, but still thin and bland.",

They offer an array of hot and cold beverages that are artfully crafted but available in limited and small sizes.  The ambiance is great for socializing, studying, or just sitting and people-watching. I love that it is open 24/7, 365 days a year - you can't beat that convenience!  The pastries are too numerous to review individually here, but are all delicious. I have dreams about their twice-baked croissants and their Neopolitan pastries are perfect to share. They are adding more gluten-free options (like the salted caramel brownies) but right now there are only a few.  Overall, Amelie's is an awesome venue for pretty much anything (you can also rent out the back rooms for bridal/baby showers etc.) and is only on an upward trajectory. I would definitely recommend it for people of all ages and walks of life :)",

Most recently I took my fiance here for a birthday goody. When we did finally get up to order one order taker skipped us and went to the older couple behind us. When we did get help I made mention that it was her birthday. I asked if she got anything for that as I over heard the order taker offer it to another patron for their birthday. We again got ignored.

Now, it's like a little voice in the back of my head if I'm out....\"hmm....a little something sweet from Amelie's would hit the spot\".    Never had anything there that didn't nearly make my eyes roll into the back of my head.  It's all good to me....seriously.  I've never been to the Uptown location so I can't compare but I love the eclectic nature of this joint.  Very cool and the vibe is just chill and laid back.  Fits me perfect.  The whole NoDa area is great and this place compliments it very well.    In short, I have created an affair with Amelie's that is surely something sinful yet satisfying and one to last a very long time I can tell :)",

    "text": "My wife saw a story on TV about Amelie's and suddenly \"we had to go\"!  So, we took a field trip from Ballantyne to NoDa to check it out.  For a French bakery, it's pretty lame when I can say Williams-Sonoma frozen chocolate croissants are night and day better than Amelie's.   We got a chocolate and cream cheese croissant and while they were both tasty, they were spongy and not flaky... ie, they lacked the actual appeal of a croissant.  The cream cheese puff was also very tasty, but chewy as if it was a day old or older.  For a place that's open 24 hours, you'd think they have fresher pastries in the case.  We really wanted to like Amelie's... but we will probably never go back unless we have other business to tend to in NoDa.",

My kids got the salted caramel brownie and since they inhaled them in 1.4 seconds I'm assuming they were fantastic!! The coffee was great. Next time I'll stay away from the Danishes and go for the brownie!",

The bakery is cute and they have a decent selection of pastries and breakfast/lunch items as well.  I got a bacon, egg and cheese on a croissant which took about 20 minutes to get for some reason...not really sure why since we went on a down time and it was not busy at all.  The food was good though when I got it.  We got some pastries to go and they were ok - I've definitely had way better.  The prices a super expensive for pastries though IMO.

    "text": "When I was a kid, Bill Cosby was one of America's Respected Men, believe it or not.  And from the high perch of Saturday morning television, he often pontificated to the country's youth on how breakfast was the \"most important meal of the day.\"    For too many years, I took \"most important\" to mean \"very large.\"  That led to many unconfortable weekend days saddled with the results of Shoney's Breakfast Bar or some other horrible, oversized breakfast, sometimes administered in an effort to cure a hangover (but almost always exacerbating it).  Having learned the error of my ways, I still think of breakfast as very important, but it's also important to keep it light.  A place like Amelie's French Bakery is perfect for that.  It has reasonably-sized, reasonably-priced egg sandwiches served on surprisingly decent baguettes, accompanied by very good coffee.  There are plenty of great-looking pastries as well, although I didn't try those.  You get to enjoy this fare in a dining area that looks like an undergrad's fantasy of classical French sophistication.  I mean that in a good way:  It's got a shabby-chic and comfortable appeal to it.  Impressively, Amelie's is open 24 hours a day, and I suspect that the surroundings would seem a bit surreal if you came here after a bender in the middle of the night.",

Sure, some pastries warrant a price that reflects the time involved in their making, but I've found myself and my family eating some only because they cost so damned much, there is no way I'm throwing them out.   It is, however, a fun place to meet for business or hang with friends. Definitely more eclectic, than luxurious in decor.   The primary reason I am not eager to return is the lack of love from the staff. When I am paying top dollar for something, I insist that at least pretend to value my business.",

I have seen bible study, women meeting, and girls hanging out, People with dyed hair, no hair, and wings, pre-med Student studying and groups catching up. This is an inclusive space and more importantly a safe one. I am actually a fan of their pastries although my friends would beg to differ. They love the savory soups and sandwiches. I started my Amelie affection based on the tart (hazelnut was my fav) but have shifted to their palmers, macrons and recently sticky buns. They have an eclectic variety of options made fresh daily and with that being said it can be hit or miss on the available options. Be open-minded while going as the prices are not for the faint of heart. The decor is cute and Parisian inspired which is a cute homage. Now that they have branched out I have found that there are more locations in and around charlotte and can always sneak in for a quite bite, download, coffee or chat with friends. I highly suggest you give it a try. Don't be surprised if you being to plan your next vaca to Paris. Bonjour!",

Inside they also offer a bar for local beers and champagne, and have a sizable bakery.  The building itself is a neat atmosphere, full of portraits and drawings.. you can tell a number of local creatives work there, and it suits them well!  Wife and I each got a \"made to order\" egg sandwich and coffees.  The coffee was well flavored (and again, good value), egg sandwich was good enough to have again, but not as tasty as I expected.  The croissant was fresh, but too flaky and fell apart, and the sandwich sat heavier than it needed to.  Still, we did enjoy it and would certainly stop in again (if we were locals).",

I mean, they got some solid macaroons, eclairs, and lattes and stuff but nothing that really makes crave Amelie's.  It's probably because it's one of the few places that are open at all hours, making it a solid hang-out to grab a coffee and treat at anytime.  The last time I was here was after catching a movie with some broad.  It was a random Wednesday night and the place was bumping.  When I first walked in, you can smell all the goodness and the air and baked goods displayed behind the case... and then you walk across the Sahara Desert to stand in line.  The line wrapped around to the other room... I'm decent at small-talk and killing time, but hate waiting in lines, especially with some broad on a first date!  It's the wait-in-line-for-20-minutes test - If you can't carry or want to engage in a conversation with your date, you should peace out!  (Not a real test, but I should've known...)  If you're looking for a place to hang out late at night fueled by coffee and French bakery, this place is probably for you.  But keep in mind, the lines are long (both times I went), so if you show up with a date, make sure they're interesting! #potcallingkettleblack  dmo out.",

She used to hang out here all the time, and when we passed through Charlotte on the way home from vacation, she had to go back for a visit. This is one of the coolest bakeries I've ever seen. It consists of a maze of different rooms, each different from the last, as well as a side patio and back patio that's tucked away behind the building. If I were the hang-out-in-a-coffee-shop/bakery-and-do-work kind of type and lived in Charlotte, I'd be here all the time too.  On top of the awesome layout, they offer some high quality French pastries and treats, and I'm always down for those. Unfortunately, they were out of Napoleons (my go-to), so I went with the layered chocolate torte and salted caramel brownie. Both were excellent.   We were here on Easter Sunday, and it seemed pretty busy, but I don't really have anything to compare it to. I would have taken pictures, but there's already over 400 posted, so I assumed I would be duplicating other's efforts. I may not be the coffee house type, but I do love sweets and can appreciate an awesome bakery, and that's what Amelie's is. So if you're staying in Charlotte or just passing through (maybe on your way to or from Ohio), it's definitely a sight to see!",

The other dessert we get is the key lime tart it's tiny bit packs a delicious punch with its tart lime flavor and awesome meringue top. It's my go to the past three times we've gone!

I'm a sucker for all baked goods and coffee, and this place is open (and busy) at all hours, so it's a perfect spot after a concert. I've never been here at a time that there wasn't a line stretching the entire building. It's not ideal for someone in a hurry, but if you can afford to wait in line, it's worth it. I've yet to try anything that I didn't like. The tarts are wonderful, and I don't know anywhere else to get French macarons. (I've read other reviews that suggested the French macarons are too tough or hard; mine had a perfectly crisp outer layer and spongy interior.) The eclairs are excellent as well. I love croissants, and these don't disappoint.   One downside: the price of the pastries and baked goods. A bite-sized tart runs $2.50, and a 4 inch tart is $4.50. Macarons are $2.50 per cookie.   The coffee and tea are great and very reasonably priced (much cheaper than Starbucks and a little cheaper than many other cafes). The baristas are quick and prepare the coffee well.   The menu food is decent as well. It's not what I come here for, though.   The only other negative is that the service is much less friendly than the typical cafe. The employees are so concerned with moving the line quickly that they get snippy if you have a question (especially about flavors or prices of items that aren't labeled). But I suppose if they took time to be friendly, the wait times would be much longer and they'd lose business. For friendly service and a smile, I'll stick with my small local cafes.",

Last night we were in the Noda area and decided to swing by and get a small dessert. So. Many. Options!!! We decided to split the ever delicious salted caramel brownie. I swear, this thing is like crack. We also got our our own mini mouse cups. These are perfect because they are bite size and allow you to fufill a craving without over indulging! I got caramel and my husband got espresso.  Amelies have everything from coffee to soups to salads to pastries to cakes to tortes....and the list goes on and on. My go to favorites are the creme brulee (they always have different flavors), the salted caramel brownie, the mousse cup with chocolate covered strawberry on top, and the chocolate croissant.  Notes: -Open 24 hours -There is usually a line, especially at the later hours. However, even when the line goes into the other room, it always moves very fast and is definitely worth the way.",

The food is pretty also, the decoration is exact, and elegant, it makes you feel like you are sitting outside of a bakery in France with a barrette on sipping coffee overlooking the sun set behind the glistening eiffel tower. The food is not only pretty, but it is great. The cakes are rich but not too sweet. The salted caramel brownie, salted but not to tart. Overall, amelies is as close as you can get to France without a plane or a boat. The smell of coffee and chocolate are soothing and relaxing, and the couches and chairs make you feel like royalty. While I admit the price is not the cheapest (2.50$-7.89$ for most of the single pastries) it is cheaper than airfare to France. This is the place to be.",

Have been coming here since the first weekend I've moved in Charlotte 4 years ago and it's been a staple place for me to take out-of-towners ever since. Everyone says it, but they say it for a reason. You have to try the salted caramel brownie. Even if it's just a few bites since it's so rich.. but it's worth every bite. Their lattes are also great and ambiance in this place is fun, eclectic and stands out to the other local bakeries in town. Perfect spot for meeting friends/or catching up on work-- you'll see both here.    **Rumor has it--they're opening a new 11,000 sq. foot location in Uptown replacing the College Plaza cafeteria at Wells Fargo Two. Uptown needs more local coffee shops (especially ones open on weekends).. so very excited about this!",

Between the pastries, eclectic crowd, creative decor and 24-hour access, I'm pretty sure I'd be a blimp if I lived in N. Davidson!  I'm visiting Charlotte this week and hanging with the TonyaP so I knew this place HAD to be good.    We popped in last night and there was a line snaking in front of the counter but not to worry, it moves quickly.  I stuck my head into the side room and was amazed at what I saw: antiqued furniture, high ceilings and lush fabrics.  Everything at Amelie's falls under creative, shabby chic!  Loved the overhead light piece shrouded by stainless steel cups, graters and other kitchen items.  My eyes immediately got drawn to the lit pastry case where my visual tummy was dazzled by the array of delectable sweets.  Pecan pie, fruit tarts, napoleons, eclairs and more, me wants it all!  I took it \"easy\" ordering up three items and everything was boxed up for us.    But if you know Tonya or myself, we are NOT gonna wait.  Plopped ourselves down on some stools and dug in.  That pecan pie was wonderful, full of nuts to counteract the rich, sweet filling.  And a great sweet crust that wasn't over-baked.  One of the best pecan pies I've had since it was more nutty than usual, I tried to hog it all up but shared a bite with my Yelp host.  I was buzzing with the sugar so I wisely held off on the peach tart and sea salt brownie until laters...  Seriously good baked goods, there's a lot of love and talent being placed into their product here.  Update: Finally ate the sea salt caramel brownie and it was UNBELIEVABLE!    What can I say but Amelie's rocked it out for me!  This bakery would do well in any urban center including San Francisco, call me impressed.  So Charlotte, enjoy Amelie's for everything it's got.  I for one am totally jealous that you've got this amazingly tempting bakery here.  Thankfully I'm 150 miles away, Amelie!    We'll have to have a long-distance relationship, girl...",

It's actually pretty over the top if you ask me. No amount of decor can make me forget I'm  inside a shopping center. Whatever, there's plenty of free parking!  They sell pastries, desserts, and sandwiches. The macaroons were great! The salted caramel brownie was a decadent salty/sweet treat. Everything else we had was decadent, but nothing special. I was a bit dissappointed with the eclairs. Perhaps, if I came in earlier, they would taste more fresh.   Overall, fair prices and a great stop if you are craving desserts at any hour.",

I am a fan of macaroons and theirs are simply delish.  The macaroons I have tried here include pistachio, lemon, salted caramel, passion-fruit, and coconut. I particularly enjoyed the coconut and the lemon.  Another favorite treat here is the salted caramel brownie - it has the perfect balance of sweet and just a hint of salt in the creamy caramel.   There are so many goodies behind the counter that I have not tried yet, and I am always looking forward to my next visit.  The hard part is choosing between the eclairs, napoleons, tarts, and all of the other yummy-looking pastries!

That being said, I whole-heatedly believe it is worth it. I got macaroons, a little chocolate mousse stack with a raspberry on top, and a salted caramel brownie. They were all delicious and by the happy faces and the line itself, I assume most of their items are the same.   It has a really neat and creative ambiance and is cozy with a lot of seating inside as well as a few tables outside.  The service was great and the workers interacted with the customers and knew the products well. There seemed to be enough of everything, and the staff was super friendly.

They even have small portions so you don't have to feel guilty about picking out ten desserts. I've never been disappointed with anything but the tarts are my favorite.  The staff is always willing to answer questions and help you pick something out. Unique French themed decor matched with a positive vibe. My only complaint is that I don't live there.",

Both were very tasty and the portion size was just right.  My sister had the sausage and bell pepper quiche.  I tasted it and it was absolutely delicious...may have to order that next time.  Of course, we had to get desserts.  I had the salted caramel brownie because I'd heard so much about it.  It was really yummy, but extremely sweet and rich.  I think it would be great if they sold them in half portions.  Anyway, my sister had a mixed berry tart which was great also.  The atmosphere is trendy-eclectic.  It feels like a place I'd like to go to study (there were a lot of folks camped out there with laptops).  Only complaints: it's fairly pricey for what you get, and the staff isn't overly friendly.  I will definitely  be back though!",

The pastries are all good, but if you go later at night some aren't as fresh as they could be (hazard of going late I realize which is why they still get 4 stars).  I'm a tea drinker and the variety isn't as good as other cafes in Charlotte, but definitely is a great place for a group to go after a night out to wind down.

    "text": "As a newcomer to Charlotte, exploring can be an adventure, a hazard, and sometimes both. But every once in a while, you hit the jackpot. You walk into a place and as soon as you do, you think to yourself, there is some awesome shit going on here. And y'know? That gut instinct was right. First off - the decour in this place is a-mazing. Extremely eclectic, while being chic, hilarious, hipster and interesting at the same time. I don't know how many times I pointed at things that I just wanted to up and take home with me.   STAFF: No complaints on my end, but I'm a pretty easy person to please. However, one person I was with was miffed to learn that they only used whole milk or soy to make lattes, no skim or inbetweensies. Another friend I was with is very specific in what she gets - coffee, iced, half cream/half 2%. Not only did they not have 2%, but using cream was 'against the rules', which I'm not even sure the meaning of on that one. I had no problems, though.  FOOD: Breakfast sandwiches are absolutely incredible. Sausage, egg, tomato, gruyer on a croissant. Not to mention it's huge. It was all flaky, warm and delicious. Other breakfast sandwich experiences were the same from people in my party - all to die for.  Picked up a couple of tarts, as well. The raspberry lemon tart is not only gorgeous, but absolutely delicious. Picked up another tart that was chocolate ganache with raspberry preserves, but it was a little too sweet for my taste.  I got to sample the lemon tea cake as well, and though a little pricy, I would definitely pick up some for a tea party (being a huge tea aficionado in the first place).  Coupled with the free wifi, and comfortable and plentiful seating, I'm definitely on the Amelie bandwagon. This is a great place to take anyone for coffee.... and other delicious things!",

Be prepared for long lines though, especially when college is in session and Friday and Saturday late night.  We waited in an hour ong line on Friday at 11pm.  It was so worth it though.  It's the only place you can satisfy your craving for a excellent pastry at 2:30am.  Can't wait to take my family here when they come to visit.",

My first impressions were dashed by the young man behind the pastry counter, aggressively and constantly barking at the customers about forming a line at one end of the counter. Maybe marking the desired flow on the floor would help to inform the customers.  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich on croissant, wife ordered BLT on baguette, both ordered the Creme brulee French soda to drink.  My sandwich arrived as ordered but my wife's sandwich was on croissant. No big deal as her sandwich was delicious, as was mine. The French sodas were unique and tasty. We stopped by the pastry counter to grab a few treats on our way out. The same barking man at the counter continued his aggressive behavior. My wife asked about the macaroons, \"Are the different colors a different flavor?\", he simply replied \"Yes\". He knew we didn't know which flavors were which color, Since each flavor is not marked. She had to ask \"Can you give me the run down, what flavor each one is?\". He very quickly flew thru the flavors for each. A very simple solution would be the MARK THE FLAVORS in the case!   Anyway, the ladies behind the counter were friendly enough but the overall experience was \"meh\".  If I owned this business, the barking young man would not survive another day behind my counter, as he is most likely running off repeat customers.",

Please, for the love of all that's good and decent, make a dedicated coffee line. And maybe make some little signs or something for the macarons? Amelie's is an awesome place and I'm glad they're killing it but often enough I find myself not going because I know it's gonna be a hassle.   The macarons are great, by the way. When you hear them listed 200 times and find yourself spending the better part of an afternoon, slowly inching past them, more often than not you end up getting a couple.

I can't wait to go back here and try some other desserts as well as some of their coffee.",

    "text": "Amelie's may possibly be the perfect place. I have definitely lain awake at night dreaming of their turkey, brie, and cranberry compote baguette sandwich. And, as my first review said, I have also driven 20 minutes across town for a pecan sticky bun at all hours of the night. I consider it to be an accomplishment if I can drive past Amelie's without going in- an accomplishment I have not achieved very often.   Everyone mentions the salted caramel brownie, and it is to die for. However, it's not my favorite- simply because I think it's impossible to pick a favorite. I dare you to eat an eclair without emitting uncontrollable sounds of happiness. The cream cheese muffins, filled croissants, and tartines have also padded my stomach a few times.   The service is always quick and efficient, which is saying something considering how long the line always is. I am always well taken care of by efficient and courteous staff, that have personalities and don't just stare at the counter while they ring you up.   If I lived closer, I would never leave.",

    "text": "Yesterday, I paid a visit to my favorite bakery in Charlotte to only find out that they are price gauging their long term customers.  It was very noticeable that they were no lines at all on Saturday.  We noticed immediately that the tartlets were marked up over two dollars more than the normal pricing! A simple small cake which is now $5.29.  A tartlet we would normally have for $3.29 is now $5.29.  I think what surprised us the most was the quart of soup that was always $9.99 is now$14.00.  The plates are even smaller to. Even soup and sandwich was marked up $3.00 higher and a much smaller portion of soup. They don't even give you bread with the soup anymore. They even took the water cooler from the back away. Yes, it was very obvious change in management or pure greed !  We asked why the prices soared so high, and her answer was production cost. The soup is the grandma's recipe and it is a simple recipe for the leak soup. Shame on you for taking advantage of your customers.  This is deplorable and disgusting. Your employee looked it at us  straight twice and said production costs. We would normally bring home box of goodies to share with my daughter. This was a very special place for both of us to spend our Saturday afternoon.  We notice how your customers we're not walking out with boxes of goodies. We noticed your lines were very short, actually obsolete.  If you sad to see an ioconic establishment cheap their customers for the almighty dollar.  You definitely lost us as a lifetime customer . Do not go there unless you want to be ripped off!",

It was the highlight of our day trip to Charlotte! It is the most adorable bakery, super cool atmosphere, lots of seating, neat/eclectic decor. Then there are all the delicious baked goods! Where to even begin?! My husband and I decided to try a few of the mini treats-none of which disappointed! We tried the mini hazelnut tart, a peanut butter and chocolate pettifor, a cinnamon and chocolate macaroon, and a pecan sticky bun. They were all delicious! My favorite was the hazelnut tart and my husband's favorite was the sticky bun. Amelie's is a must stop any time we go to Charlotte from now on! If you haven't been, you're missing out! They also serve soups, salads, and sandwiches--we'll have to try the savory side of Amelie's next time!",

Love the Italian and French bakeries and Amelie make me feel as if I'm in France.  Tough to do in a shopping center but they do it well.",

The pastries we ordered were the carmel brownies, the fruit turnover and the fruit pecan pie tarts. I didn't get to eat the turnover, my SO ate that one so I can't comment. I had a bite of these cute little fruit pecan pie tarts and I wanted more. Too bad my SO ate the whole thing. So I got back up and went back in line, only to find out they had sold out!! :( I got the pecan pie tarts instead. They were just as tasty. I didn't like the caramel brownies as much. Maybe a bit too sweet and sticks to my teeth. But it is a prize winner, so you have to try for yourself!   We also tried the pate sandwich in french bread and the turkey club sandwich in croissant. Both sandwiches were good but I preferred the pate. And if given the choice I would probably just eat all the tarts and skip the sandwiches.   Coffee was good and a must have if you are eating the caramel brownies! :)   We enjoyed the unique decor and just being able to sit there and enjoy each other's company in this cute little store.",

Luckily Amelie's has other offerings that keep me interested and coming back for more!   One favorite is the breakfast sandwich. I order mine with spinach, egg whites, and mozzarella on a baguette. It is lightly toasted and the cheese is melted perfectly. It is $4.89 and 75 cents extra to sub egg whites for the whole egg. It's so good I don't care and sometimes I am guilty of ordering two!  After I'm done eating probably a day's worth of calories on 2 breakfast sandwiches, sometimes I feel like eating something \"healthy.\" Lynn's salad is tiny and pricey but it's amazing! It's made up of mixed greens, mandarin oranges, strawberries, feta, and candied almonds but the thick, gooey, brown crap that it comes with makes it crave-worthy! It is called celery seed vinaigrette but it doesn't look much like a vinaigrette. It's sweet and tangy and I always have to get extra because one little cup just isn't enough! If I happen to have any leftover then I just eat the rest of it by the spoonful and if it wasn't looked down on then I would just lick that cup clean.. Ah who am I kidding I've already done that!  Listen to the majority and get the salted caramel brownie! Dense, rich brownie on the bottom and a layer of toffee flavored caramel on top.. Mmmm. Also the lemon raspberry tart is delish!  Minus one star because it's expensive for the tiny portions but the flavors are on point!",

    "text": "Having been in Charlotte for a while, I suppose it's time I left a review for one of its more storied establishments.   Amelie's is an eclectic bakery that is essentially a kitchen in the midst of a cobbled-together strip mall hideaway. The seating is a tad on the cramped side, but that's mainly due to the place's unflinchingly large crowd. Don't arrive super hungry after 9pm most nights. The decor is what draws the eclectic descriptor for the place. It's weird, but it works.  The coffee is pretty good, but the seasonal iced teas are a real draw. That and the multiple cases of French-inspired sugary goodness. It doesn't want for desserts. The place stays busy because it has the French cafe goodies to satisfy any sweet tooth.  It's also a great, neutral place to meet people. I see a lot of first dates there - and actually met my wife there for the first time. We also catered our in-lieu-of-cake wedding desserts from here, meaning the NoDa location. I have not yet visited the new Uptown location.  All in all, there is a lot to like at Amelie's, from atmosphere and people-watching to the actual food and drink on-hand. It's a bit crowded at times with quite a din, but it's also comfortable in its own skin. I recommend it when you have the time and the need to satisfy a craving. Or just whenever you feel like getting a treat.",

It's just different  Service:  Cool, somewhat works fast as a team   Environment:   Small groups, couples, friends meeting, solo venturing to get work done or to relax  Food:   Pastries (from what I saw), cakes, bread, soups, breakfast sandwiches  Prices:   Very affordable, not expensive  Huge Pros: 24 hours Operating  Debbie Downers:  It can be very crowded in somewhat a decent size space.   Conclusion:   I am a fan of their Chai Latte.  Very good stuff.  I like the place.  Really like that it is 24 hours, that's pretty cool.  It's a glorified Starbucks  Overall: It's in a quiet section not too far from Uptown charlotte.  It's a nice laid back kind of venue.  The service can be better but other than that, It is a place I would not mind people to hang out, relax or get work done.  Grade: B",

    "text": "I must say, Amelie's is one of the best! I'm not from Charlotte, or even from North Carolina for that matter, so when my friend told me she was taking me to a bakery, I thought \"what's so special about a bakery?\"   I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of choices there were. I mean they had everything! Pumpkin pies, cakes, muffins, cream puffs, croissant, french macaroons and so much more. I was also surprised that they had a breakfast and dinner menu as well. However, if you're looking for a full hearty meal, this is not the place. The dinner menu consists of soups, chicken salads and small sandwiches.   The atmosphere is just awesome. A quirky twist on old french decor makes everything so inviting and warm and if you look closely, you'll find hidden messages on the walls that will make you giggle.   My one piece of advice is to check the menu while standing on line or before you get there. The line itself if VERYYYY long, so once you get to the counter, just be ready to order!   happy eating!!",

    "text": "People go to Amelie's because it's \"cool\" and to be frank, it is a pretty cool place. The place is covered in quirky and fun decor from an Etch-A-Sketch art piece to Joseph Ducreux marking where the line for ordering begins. Not to mention there are always a half dozen people on their laptops and usually a guy out in the atrium strumming along his guitar. One might say that at Amelie's you feel cooler than cool. (You might even feel ice cold. Alright, alright?)  Amelie's is always packed. ALWAYS. I don't think I've ever seen the place even remotely quiet -- not even during the later hours. Except to wait a while in line to order because yes, it does stretch around to the other room sometimes.   While there's no denying Amelie's atmosphere is fantastic, I'm not quiet sure what the hype about their food is all about. Their desserts are pretty hit or miss. The macarons are particularly disappointing. I like my macarons with a hard outer shell and a soft fluffy on the inside. Amelie's macarons have the consistency of hard cookies. I have, however, enjoyed some of their mini cakes and mousse cups. Their non-dessert food (or \"non-fun\" food if you've got a sweet tooth like me) is pretty solid as well. Be aware that their baguettes are huge and you might want to have a buddy help you out. (Or not. I'm not here to judge.)   I'm not a coffee drinker but the my friends that are have not had any issues with the coffee. The tea is also very nice and is loose leaf, not bagged. They also have speciality sodas and drinks that change seasonally.    Amelie's isn't too far off in price from Starbucks and while some of their desserts have disappointed me, it's worth stopping here rather than your local Starbucks if you've got the chance. While Amelie's isn't the holy grail of cafes or bakeries, it's worth checking out. Because, afterall, what's cooler than being cool? Amelie's.",

This place is definitely overrated, and an absolute fraud of a \"french bakery/cafe.\"   Entering the restaurant, you feel a darkness that does not match the mood of Paris at all! The hodge-podge of furniture and items meant to be eclectic parisian trinkets, seem displaced in an undefined space that isn't warm and doesn't have ambience.   I was especially disappointed that the pastries- which they should perfect as a core competency- were truly disappointing. Every croissant was crispy! We ordered 6!   Worst of all, the option of spinach on the breakfast sandwich-is actually dried frozen spinach!   The one good thing I had was a Layered Latte, and it was delicious! For that, I give it a star.   Needless to say, I won't be back; but truly hope the owner(s) of this place will have a real Parisian experience and  revamp this attempt at offering one!",

The creme brulees were torched after we ordered them so they were perfect and so creamy. You could see the tiny vanilla bean caviar in the cream! It was soo flavorful. The brownie was like nothing I'd ever had before. It looked overwhelmingly sweet at first sight but when I took that first bite, I immediately went for another.

My fool proof go-to is the salted caramel brownie. I'm a huge fan of French Macaroons, but sometimes the cookie here is a little too chewy or clumpy and it kind of ruins it for me.   If you're looking for somewhere to try new things, drink some good coffee or have quality time with friends. I recommend you do it here. I personally find it hard to do homework in a place where all I can smell is cinnamon things but that's just me. I have no will power.   P.S: If you're planning on going between the hours of any day whatsoever at anytime, be prepare to stand in a line ranging from 10 people, to the length of humans it would take to equal the span of the Great Wall of China. Not even Mark Wahlberg can cut that line for you.",

The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes there is no seating available and it is so packed it takes 30 minutes to get to the front of the line and get your food.....but I guess awesome places like Amelies can't avoid the crowds because the place is just so dang good! If you're visiting Charlotte, don't skip over this place as it is a must-see. Amelies also designed and baked all the pastries in the Hunger Games movie, which I thought was a fun fact.

It's just so... cavernous.  And the decor is a little fussy for my taste.  And it feels like a warehouse that someone's grandmother's house has thrown up on.  All of this to say that I don't feel particularly relaxed or comfortable when I go to Amelie's, and though I've brought a book or a magazine or some writing, all I really want to do is finish my croissant and split.  I think the high ceilings and general lack of space dividers make me feel very exposed.  Sort of the same reason I don't like Best Buy.",

Here's what I don't like: the place is always crowded and the food and espresso drinks are overpriced.  I paid about $4.50 for a small latte (which costs less than $3 most other places). The woman at the register was in a foul mood and was very short with me when I asked for skim milk. Apparently, they don't have skim milk, only soy.  The latte was not good (I threw it away on my way out the door).  I've had the croque monsieur, which was extremely greasy, and the turkey and brie sandwich wasn't great either.  I'm pretty sure I'm the only person in Charlotte who doesn't like their salted caramel brownies (how can they call that thing a brownie, anyway?!).  About half of the staff members I've interacted with were down-to-earth pleasant individuals, the others were haughty and downright snotty. 50% is not good enough in my book.",

I wish I could exclusively support businesses that are open 24 hours but that would reduce me to Amelie's and the Waffle House, so I've got to be realistic.  But, at the very least, I try to throw as much support to Amelie's as I can.  Despite what some other reviewers have said, I love the decor here.  It is cleverly done vintage/DIY/Shabby Chic, and it works.  It has lots of different rooms, each with their own feel.  You can decide if you want to be in a quiet study room, a quiet conversation room, an atrium or the bustling business end.  Fantastic.  I have been this place quite a few times, too, and have always had excellent service, so not sure what these other gripes are about.  It does get busy at peak hours (weekend afternoons), so take that into consideration.  But, of course, you can always go at 2am, as well :)  And the food is great, too.  I highly recommend the Napoleons, tea cakes, salted caramel brownies, twice-baked croissants, hot chocolate, their soups and the breakfast egg sandwiches.  Also, I often stop by to get a frozen baguette which you can pop in the oven and eat at your leisure later on.    My only nits are that I think their prices are a bit high, and I don't love their vanilla strawberry minicake (too much icing that needed to be served at room temperature (not chilled) and not enough strawberries and delicious cake).  These minor issues though, do nothing to detract from the overall awesomeness of this place.",

    "text": "After hearing so many rave reviews about Amelie's I figured it was time to experience the bakery first-hand to see if I would be singing its praises like everyone else.  How do I rate it? Good but way over-hyped.  The building itself, however, is pretty cool. The outside of it is fairly inconspicuous, but as soon as you cross through the threshold, you enter a whole different atmosphere. The inside resembles an old Victorian house with seating throughout. Though I was impressed by its uniqueness, I can't say that I felt relaxed there; I wouldn't spend hours at Amelie's as I would at other coffee shops.   The food was OK. I kept it fairly simple with an ice tea and a turnover--nothing too crazy or special, for that matter.   The service is friendly and quick, but to the Amelie's staff, I implore you---please, please, please don't call me ma'am. Especially three times during a 30-second period of taking my order. Maybe it's a Southern thing, but to us Northerners, it makes us feel old!",

Amelie's has a unique atmosphere with a fun, fast moving crowd waiting to devour all of the delicious goodies presented in the glass cases. Don't get overwhelmed. Embrace the energy of all of the smiling people and the friendly staff. They are open 24hrs a day  with free wifi.   Favorite items are: Creme brulee Salted caramel brownie  Palmiers  Anything with fruit on it All of the soups & sandwiches are amazing  The employees are amazing, the location is amazing, and the amount of seating is usually wonderful. Even if you can't find seating in the main building, there is extra seating outside as well as in the atrium in the back. I have been at many different times of the day and always can find a seat. Even if the tables get a bit crowded most people use the \"sharing is caring\" policy & if you have available seat you can invite others to sit with you. It's a fun way to meet new people :)",

Get your food and hope to find a table, don't worry one will turn up.   The decor is borderline cute and over the top but nonetheless fun to look at.  They have pastries galore!! Everything from croissants, to macaroons to cream puffs, all delicious. They also have soups and sandwiches, everything you need to spend hours working, studying or just hanging out with friends. I wish I lived closer, I would be there errday!    If you have not visited it yet you are missing it, so hurry and check it out.",

    "text": "(see explanation of ratings below)  3 of 3 stars (excellent fast food).  One of those places you just gotta see when in Charlotte.  What to wear: a black beret.  What to take: your laptop or iPad.  Open 24 hours.  About $11 per person, gratuity not included.  Order at the counter and they deliver to your seat.  That plus the use of paper napkins and paper cups means they cannot get 5 stars (this is not fine dining).  Cute warehouse-like set-up.  Incredible selection of house-made pastries and other baked goods.  About my ratings:  Only fine dining establishments can garner five stars.  Until yelp realizes that a fast food joint cannot possibly be ranked equally with a $100 per person place, I need to draw the line somewhere.  If we were only talking about the quality and presentation of the food, it would be a different story.  But, as we know, yelp's rankings take into account the entire dining experience.  Therefore, I divide restaurants into three categories (and I wish yelp would do the same):  1) fast food (no table service)  2) casual dining (table service)  3) fine dining (linen napkins, no plastic cups, no TV's in dining room, typically more expensive than casual dining)  Fine dining can earn a max of five stars.  Casual dining can earn a max of four stars.  Fast food can earn a max of three stars.",

I don't know how someone can't like Amelie's..... it's such an eclectic mix of everything-decor, people, pastries, smiles, hipsters and drinks. Of course, the one thing that Amelie's has that many other places don't is the open- 24 -hours-factor. That is one of my major gripes about places in this area since I moved from the west where there seemed to be alot more 24 hours places. Why don't more businesses in the area see that that right there is a cash cow? Plus, I believe freaks come out at night so it's a fabulous people watching experience. Anywho, the fact that they are open 24 hours and I actually feel safe walking to and from my car at 1AM or 2AM is a major plus.   Their chai latte is one of the best I've had and I keep swearing I am going to try more of their pastries but my booty begs me not to. I love Amelie's--more businesses should take after them",

I have heard from most patrons that the Salted Caramel Brownie is amazing, but I've never tried it because I'm not a big caramel fan. So, if you are, I'd recommend trying it. I definitely think you should go here just to experience the atmosphere, but don't expect to be impressed by the food. It's probably great as a dessert stop after a few dinner cocktails, though.

I hope they cater or make cakes to order . I'd love to start getting special made cakes here :) .

I like to say that anything on a croissant can't disappoint. I tend to go for the teas because I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't attest to its quality. As for the sweets, I've not always been so happy with them. Some of the more outrageous ones with lots of extras attached are overdoing it in my opinion. And the expensive colorful truffles are not worth it. I guess that's why the case seems to always be full of them. Go for the breads or sandwiches and get the white tea.  The atmosphere and layout along with all the kitschy vintage furniture that looks like it could've come out of anywhere from your grandma's storage shed to Rococo era France is great for mood setting. Then there's the courtyard in the back with all the trees and the skylights. This place is always moving, always has people and is always surprisingly quite relaxed 24/7.",

Their pumpkin with cream cheese filling is so delicious.  The salted caramel brownie was good after being in my fridge for two days (it hid on me!).  The apple turnover is flaky and tasty too.  I really appreciate this place having just moved to Charlotte a few months ago.",

If you've never been beyond the pastry case in the front of this location you are missing out. It extends so far back it's hard to believe. They have so many little nick-knacks to look at you'll never be bored.  I also didn't realize you could rent the place out. Someone told me that it could hold a wedding party of 80! We only had the back rooms rented out for about 20 people and it was plenty of space.   Amelie's provided quiche Lorraine which was wonderful, as well as a spinach quiche, their famous pastries, coffee, and orange juice. I was so impressed with their food I took some home to my husband, who took literally a bite out of everything because he couldn't decide what to eat.",

Once you get up to the counter though, the staff is extremely attentive and never make you feel rushed.  I love their chocolate mousse and their iced coffee.  Sadly they consistently run out of my fiances favorite (Napolon), so I guess that means they are really good!  The location itself has a cute, ecclectic vibe.  Definately a nice spot to sit with some coffee and dessert.  I wish they had more outdoor space though.  On a nice day, there is never an open table!",

Open 24 hours, there's never an off-time (although there are many ON times, with a line reaching into separate rooms). You'll know you're in the right spot right away, with all the creative artwork and antique pieces, I've heard it feels just like France (although I will verify AFTER my future visit!) The restaurant is made up of 3 rooms with an eclectic array of chairs and tables. Free wifi, and water too and you'll find outlets along the walls for the necessary charge [NOTE: I discovered the back room gets the best reception during my visit!]  You'll walk in and immediately be greeted by a glass counter filled with goodies: pastries and sweet treats. But that's not all that Amelie offers! They've got a breakfast and lunch menu filled with sandwiches, quiche and coffee/teas. I recommend the turkey and brie sandwich, it's served on a baguette with a seedy raspberry jam. I've tried an assortment of treats and much say I need to keep trying! The Napoleon was too messy and tricky to eat: you really need to let it heat up but it falls apart really easily. I also tried a fruit (maybe orange) and tarragon macaron recently that was just ok on flavor although great texture. The downside is that Amelie's is pretty pricy when it comes to their bakery, so you can't go too crazy without the bill going crazy. I'll keep returning until I find the perfect combination, you really can't get over the atmosphere!",

I tried the macarons, the salted caramel brownie, and a small strawberry topped cake. I was disappointed to find that the food looked better than it actually tasted. The macarons were okay but tasted stale. They probably taste better when they have a fresh batch ready but it appears that they restock items from a freezer or fridge in the back. The salted caramel brownie was really flat and small portioned. It was also rather hard from being refrigerated. I prefer brownies warm and soft. The strawberry cake was decent but also cold and hard.",

Here's several highlights about this bakery:   The salted caramel brownies are delicious! This is one of their best sellers... and I'd say that it lives up to the hype. I had the rose eclair on my last visit and while it was good, it didn't beat the brownies.   I've been to this location multiple times and there's always a line to place an order. My last visit was on a Saturday around 8:30PM. There were probably about 15 people ahead of me. So if you're looking for a grab and go experience, this is not the place.   The ambiance is very whimsical and cute. I love it! They have plenty of seating. Lots of people seem to come here to work. I've never done it so can't testify to the quality of their wifi or number of power outlets... however judging by the crowd, I can safely assume they do pretty good job on both.",

Mostly I order the breakfast sandwiches on a croissant which are delicious. Sometimes I'll order lunch and the Seeded Roast Beef is great. The consistency of the food items (not the bakery) and especially the soups are hit or miss for me.  I feel like it depends on who's cooking or preparing whether or not my asiago is melted on my sandwich or if the Leek soup tastes like high blood pressure. Some days the food is yum and also I've thrown away my share of barely eaten food on others. I'm a simple dessert kinda lady so all fruity concoctions are not my proverbial cup of tea but I have been known to get down on a cinnamon stick or 2 or 5 but who's counting?! Can I take off stars for side effects like gaining 10lbs?   The other thing is the price. Amelies is expensive. Today I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a croissant and a coffee and it was $9. Most days I spend closer to $15. I get it--it's all French Bakery Swanky but dang! I like Amelie's enough to keep eating here but if I had more choices around I'd probably choose them more.",

I asked for a large cup of tea for my long drive home (which I had gotten without a problem this AM at the other location) and they refused to put it in a large cup. I would've paid more for the bigger cup even though it probably wouldn't have cost them anything. I asked several different people for the additional water and no one could make it happen even though they had a larger cup on the counter. While the treats were wonderful the service left a bad taste in my mouth.",

I didn't care that my mouth was burned for almost two weeks after ... and the pastry was amazing. Can't remember what it was called since I was in awe of how pretty it looked... and it tasted just as pretty.   I also got lucky because I heard the lines are always very long, but nope. I was the 5th customer in line. Great experience!! I'm definitely coming back here again.   By the way, the wall of locks is such a good touch to the spot!",

The salted caramel brownie was the specialty and 5 stars - a unique almost melting chocolate base (egg whites??) with an equal amount of caramel on top. The brownie base and the caramel top were equally good and mixed together in a candy bar swirl when eating. The lemon pastry was fine. Lemon and lime pies had come out of the back when we were there are looked really good.  The atmosphere is fun with mismatched seating and hip lighting with something to see in any direction. The service was very friendly and helpful with patience in explaining any of the baked goods as well as providing helpful recommendations. Prices were a little expensive with small pastries around 2.50 and larger single serving cakes around 5.00.",

    "text": "I always wanted to go to the Amelie's since I study French and I'm obsessed with French culture and cuisine.Last year I went to study abroad in France and let me tell you that \"Amelie's\" is a bakery, but definitely not FRENCH bakery. Have you ever had french macarons? or napoleon cake? Their products may look like the original French but they are not. I went there today specifically to treat my bf and myself with nice French deserts. At first,  I couldn't even bite the macaron, that's how hard it was! it was not fresh, had weird coloring. for example, pistachio macaron usually has mint color or light green. Here is was toxic bright green, and didn't have the same taste. The food did not smell nice,  it had some kind of artificial smell. Moreover, the cake itself was not macaron at all, it only looked like one. The chocolate \"macaron\" was simply a sticky kind of brownie instead of two pieces of meringue with soft ganache inside. The napoleon was made from frozen parts of cream and only thin slice of pastry, and basically looked and tasted like cheap frozen pies that you can buy from Bi-lo or Harris teeter(even groceries have better frozen cakes). Napoleon is not even supposed to be frozen! It tasted like an ice-cream, and felt like an ice-cream. I don't mind ice-cream at all, but they False advertised it as a regular napoleon cake. I've tried several deserts and returned them, and fortunately cashier issued me a refund. However, I will not come back. If you want to try traditional macarons go to the Earth Fare or Cafe Monte. P.S. the interior is nice, \" a la francais\", but you can put little copies of Eiffel Tower everywhere and it still not going to make it a French cafe/patisserie/restaurant if the food served there is not French and not fresh. The personnel had no idea about what they were selling, the guy whom I questioned had to go to the backdoor 4(!) times to answer do they use traditional recipes or not and if the pastry they sell was made according to the French recipes.",

It was incredibly busy inside the whole time we were there, and after trying the desserts, I can see why!   I got a raspberry lemon tart, a chocolate raspberry tart, a salted caramel brownie, a strawberry vanilla cake, and a creme brulee. The creme brulee was sweet, creamy, and melted in your mouth. I loved seeing the flecks of vanilla bean in the custard! The strawberry cake was good and not dry, but the taste was pretty ordinary. The raspberry lemon tart was filled with a delicious lemon curd and sour raspberries on top of a buttery crust; delicious, but the meringue made it a touch too sweet. The chocolate raspberry tart was amazing; rich, melt in your mouth dark chocolate with a dollap of raspberry jam/preserves. One of my favorites! The best dessert was definitely the salted caramel brownie, I can see why this was their rise to fame! Smooth salty caramel on top of a crispy, chocolate brownie. I would come back to Charlotte just to buy ten of those!   The only bad thing about Amelie's was the service was incredibly lackluster. The girl serving us was rude and had a condescending attitude. I asked what was in the chocolate cake and she replied, \"chocolate cake\". What if I had a food allergy and wanted to know if I would be able to eat it? If only the quality of service matched the quality of the food, then Amelie's would get five stars, but we were not impressed by anybody working there that night.",

I simply got a double baked chocolate croissant and chocolate tart. The baked goods were just okay for me. There is a larger menu for sandwiches and salads and drinks which I didn't partake in.   The atmosphere is whimsical and super cute. Sideway chandeliers, Paris themed art work decorated a la Alice in Wonderland. Fun place to spend some time in day or night!",

My girlfriend has stopped by and gotten me macarons from Amelie's a few times before and they have been nothing but amazing every single time. Even the weird flavored ones that I haven't enjoyed (birthday cake, cotton candy), you can tell they're made perfectly and if you were a fan of the flavor, you'd be EXTREMELY satisfied, I guarantee it. The macarons are just that good. If I were to recommend three I would say 1) pistanchio, 2) raspberry, and 3) salted caramel. I don't even LIKE salted caramel but somehow it is stupid good.  The only other thing I've had here was a bacon, egg, and cheese on a croissant that was DELICIOUS. I'm not sure why I haven't gone back for another but it's something I need to do in the immediate future.   I know my girlfriend gets croissants, coffee, lemon spritzers, pie, and other things from there and she's always enjoyed everything she's purchased! I have nothing but good things to say about Amelie's. 5 out of 5 would go again and again.",

I love how the quality has remained the same through out. The first time I went was with a friend who raved about their macaroons. I had to try it. I'm now addicted. I try them everywhere I go. Amelie's has the best macaroons IMO.   Their iced coffees are strong. On one of my visits with my friend we opted to have caramel added to our remade drinks because it was almost on the bitter side. Which leads me into customer service. They treat you real good here. They are willing to go through flavors and heating up your treats when needed. I see why people of all ages and walks of life can be found here. The relaxing atmosphere and the bomb treats.  Amelie's is a must when you're in Charlotte. I haven't tried their other baked goods but my friends say their awesome. Please check them out if you're looking for a treat...or two!",

Not much space between the doors and the pastry case which is great planning in my book; way convenient to get an orange macaron while deciding on snacks. According to legend this is ground zero, the home of the provencal trailer park motif seen and loved by all. Half a Croque Monsieur plus tomato fennel soup and icy water sounded about right. Usually not a fan of the red soup but it's got fennel...! which fixed everything up nicely thank you very much. Hot vermilion soup abounding with flavor, texture, and substance - not the feeble stuff of childhood. My sandwich was superb! a healthy smear of spicy dijon zip complementing the subtle dignity of gruyere on thin sliced hams nestled in a flakey buttery toasted croissant. Yea for a ham sammich!",

Location:  it was late on a Monday evening (9pm) and the place was packed - mostly of college/high school kids getting school work or studying done - as long as you see what you want and order it - you get through the lines fairly quickly.  It did take us a bit of time to find a table but we found a really small bistro table and were able to carry a conversation - albeit the place was a bit loud.    Service:  Not everything had labels/descriptions, so the staff patiently answered any questions anyone had which was great.  Many of the tables could have used some busing/cleaning before being turned over - but the place was still very clean.  Food:  I am one of the odd balls who doesn't like sweets, and so, it must LOOK and taste great for it to be worth it.  I selected the Strawberry Vanilla Petit Gateau  and the Salted Caramel Layered Torte.  These were not overly sweet - which was great, but it didn't pack the punch of a pastry that I was expecting.",

    "text": "I'm considered by many (and myself) to be a food snob. That doesn't mean the food has to be uppity, Michelin star quality. It just has to be done right, with proper ingredients, and proper preparation.   Amelie's delivers on all of this. I can't believe it's taken me 2 years to find this place since they opened. I've only been there a hand full of times so far, but my goal is to try everything on their menu and in their case at least once (and not gain a ton in the process).   Their soups are very flavorful. I tasted the Tomato Fennel which had a very surprising and pleasant spice to it (heat spice, just a little bit). I ordered it but when it came time to deliver they were out. I happily substituted the Portabello and Caramelized Onion with Goat Cheese, which I regretted not asking for a sample of to begin with. Very flavorful broth, and I loved the small chunks of goat cheese. My boyfriend had the Spinach, Asparagus, and Leek soup which was very light and flavorful. I've also had the Thai Sweet Potato which was exceptional in flavor. A hint of curry, chunks of sweet potato. I enjoy that none of the soups are served scalding hot and come with a portion of baguette.   Sandwiches have been phenomenal. I would typically never order roast beef, but after trying the Seeded Roast Beef I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. Perfect amount of horseradish and served warm. The Croque Monseiur lived up to my expectations, as I spent about 24 hours in anticipation dreaming about ordering it for dinner that night. Perfectly crisped brioche with melted Gruyere on top... just yum.   The desserts and pastries.... wow. As someone with a degree in culinary arts who has taken her fair share of baking courses, I fully appreciate the difficulty, complexity, and time involved in baking True French confections. I appreciate that Amelie's does not try to put their own spin on much, rather represent True French cuisine. They do it very well. The eclairs are better than any I've had, and I do enjoy their chocolate bavarian cream filled (one of their few unique twists). The chocolate hazelnut tart is dense and rich, as is one of their small chocolate tort offerings. The coconut macaroons are crispy on the outside and perfectly chewy on the inside. Salted caramel brownies are to die for.... just insanely dense, fudgy, with a delightfully smooth and creamy caramel on top. No wonder it's an award winner. The cherry turnover had a spot-on flaky crust, but I wish their had been more whole cherries in the filling. Their blueberry and cream cheese danish is hands down the most amazing danish I've had in my life. Other danish do not deserve to use the name.   In addition to the food, you can't beat the atmosphere. It has a good, positive feel to it and the scenery is always changing. It's a diverse crowd and the owners are very nice people. I kind of wish they had cappuccino/espressos, but now I'm just getting very picky. Add in the fact that they're open 24/7, and it's definitely a favorite in my book. The price is absolutely fair for the quality of food.",

This place seems to always stay packed with Hipsters (with a capital H!), students, working professionals, older folks, and the most eccentrically adorned individuals you have ever witnessed. This is primarily due to its location in the North Davidson area (NoDa). The thing that keeps me coming back is the spinach soup. I never go wrong when I order it. The desserts are okay. I tried the sweet potato bread pudding and was not impressed. I think they make the mistake with it being to eggy. As a tip to the chef, leave out the egg white and only use the egg yolk. Also, I have never been served bread pudding without some kind of sweet sauce to be drizzled over it. Mine tasted rather dry and left much to be desired in the \"sweet\" department. Unfortunately, after my third bite, I begged one of the employees for some icing or agave. She directed me to the coffee bar and suggested honey. As outrageous as that sounds, the honey made it taste better, but definitely not a winner. The creme brulee is also okay. Perhaps a lot better than the bread pudding. I have enjoyed better, but I suppose the lower price coincides with the quality. Seating is alright, outlets are reasonable. The back of the building is quieter than the front which forever has a long line. I will say, the employees do their best to make sure you are not waiting too long though. I come back because it is a place to get work done and is open a whopping 24 hours. If my local Starbucks had the same hours, that is probably where you would find me all the time.",

We were going to celebrAte with my family however the floods came and we could not meet. So my husband and I celebrated together and when we cut into the cake it was so dry that we could only eat the chocolate mousse and ganache. I decided to call this bakery to see what their policy was. I was told that they had 2 new bakers and maybe the simple syrup didn't get put on my cake. The manager said come by anytime and they would let me choose what I wanted. I called 2 weeks later and was told by another manager that they had made me another cake like the first one but I didn't come get it so they cut it and gave it away. I told her I was never told this and didn't know. She asked me how many people and asked me what I wanted. I said 8 and the small cake,like the large one I ordered, would be fine and the salted caramel brownies and gluten free ones for my daughter. She said fine I'll have it all ready for you. I could not believe that I was given 3 small cakes and some kind of small squares and 4 brownies and she said you can cut the small cakes in half.Needless to say I went to Publix, bought a 24.00 cake and my husband, my family and the waitress loved it.",

I went in after a late lunch with my sister (we saved our dessert space specifically for Amelies)  Stepping in, the insides were soooooo cute, just makes you want to stay in for a couple hours :)  All the desserts looked simply indulgent, and it was hard to select just 2-3 items.  I love tea cakes, but when I couldnt decide between the raspberry and lemon, the lovely lady said she would choose raspberry--as did I.  And Im glad I did because it was so light yet rich and flavorful.  Light because I didnt feel the need for milk with it :-D  I also got a Palmier (very crispy and buttery) and a cinnamon stick.  I chose smaller and lighter things because I had a big lunch.  I will be back to sample everything else, and more time on my hands. The service was excellent, even with a line behind me, the person behind the counter patiently waited while I selected.  Everyone was nice, helpful and fast.",

Must be keeping it Paris authentic, because rude is the word that first comes to mind.  From the pastry box filler to the cashier.  This place gave me anxiety and had my wife not had her heart set on this place (and already filled a box with pastries), I  would have walked out.  Menus people could look at while they are in line would make this process move much quicker, and staff understanding that you can't see the menu until right before you order would make it much more of a pleasant visit.",

This location is open 24 hours and plays hip music with a variety of places to sit and get work done. I got the yogurt and granola with berries and it was on point. Coffee is delicious. I'd definitely recommend this place.",

I hear they are open 24 hours too. I think that's perfect for students, artists, and night owls. I am visiting from Chicago. When I return to NC I will definitely make this one of my go to spots.",

I don't mind paying good money for GREAT pastry, but each time I try something I walk away feeling like it's \"just okay\" and could have found something just as good elsewhere for equal or less cost. The atmosphere is great and fun at both locations although I would say the NODA locale is a bit funkier and more group friendly. This is a great place to take a group a friends. Being that it's open 24 hours (NODA only) it is also a great place to get some work done, read, or recover from an evening of brewery hopping.

I never even thought I would dig macaroons like that, but at Amelie's, I do! And they have sooo many flavors! One of my favorite sweets, that may just send you into an immediate diabetic coma, fyi, is the Salted Caramel Brownie TORTE. DeeeeeeeeeeeeeLIcious. If you've had the Salted Caramel Brownie and loved it, I strongly recommend upgrading to its even lovelier big brother. I also really dig their teacakes -- lemon, almond, annnd raspberry. On the non-sweets side, I LOVE their Spinach-Artichoke Soup!! And a few of their croissant sandwiches. So much delicioiusness here. The only dish I would not recommend here is any salad. I feel like they don't give you much for the price, and what little they do give you isn't great. Other than that, the only other halfway negative about this place is that most of the sweets are not cheap! Which I guess can be a good thing so you don't overdue it and expand in your waistline as you shrink in your wallet, ha! But nonetheless, it is something worth mentioning.  And other than the edible goods here, I just LOVE Amelie's as a whole -- the real laidback, chill atmosphere...and the very eclectic people (to match the also-very eclectic decor).. many who tend to be very friendly and conversational if you're up for it! It's a great place to go and either hang out with friends or solo, study, read a book, write a paper, hit up after the club, or just chill out. ALSO, and one of the greatest things of all: It's 24 HOURS, 7 DAYS A WEEK!!!! How many places in Charlotte (or North Carolina) are there that you can say that about?  So yes... Amelie's: One of my faves.",

They were out of all the featured sides as well. Grossness Does not even begin to cover the nasty tasting food.  Yuck. I left hungry!   My husband had the Brie and roast beef sandwich.  He said the one tiny slice of Brie was good, there was 1 slice of roast beef in the sandwich which did not even cover the length of the bread. He said he would never go back also.  The desserts did not taste fresh either.  Overpriced food which tastes disgusting!  Terrible service, long lines!  I am not a fan of Panera, but I would take Panera a thousand times over this crappy, junky place!",

I can say that, i mustve started at the display case for at least 10 minutes before realizing, the line starts all the way at the other side of the bakery. It really didnt take long for the line to move- so that was good.  As far as the pastries -ehhh. They are ok, Macaroons was all right, I think, our pastry chef here at works does a way better job.   All I can say is SALTED CARAMEL BROWNIE - if you havent tried anything in this bakery, THIS IS THE GO TO ITEM! i am in love with this dessert.  Besides the long line, a-ok macaroons. They made up for the salted caramel brownie. I will be back just for that.",

They don't seem to have the puff pastry layered very well and there is no Almond croissant available. There is a very hard overcooked double-baked croissant with an Almond filling, but won't be ordering that again.  The macaroons are wonderful, the Ecalir was perfect and of course the famous Salted Caramel brownie is the best.",

I finally found a place in the atrium. Unfortunately it was too far away to use their wifi. After waiting about 20 minutes on my food, I decided to get it to go instead. The girl at the counter was very pleasant and helpful in getting it changed over. As soon as I got to outside I realized the cup of soup was spilling in the bag. Btw- it was portobello & onion, the mushroom seemed like an afterthought in decent french onion soup. I then noticed that the full sandwich I paid for looked very small(they only gave me 1/2 of my full sandwich-the pieces didn't match based on the diagonal cut). At this point, I didn't feel like even going back in to deal with the missing half sandwich.  I'm sure someone in the kitchen enjoyed it. I liked my half of the turkey and brie. I'll probably go back, but not if they are packed.",

Alright, kids, if you haven't made your way to the sketchy part of NoDa yet to sample some of the best French pastries this side of Paris, then whatcha waitin' for? You won't be disappointed by the rich, savory goodness Amelie's has to offer: flaky croissants, rich, creamy Napoleons, thick and gooey eclairs, the works. But it's all not just belly-filling desserts at Amelie's; a slew of delicious sandwiches, soups, cheeses, and, of course, French breads are available for your liking, and they're all fantastic. Seriously, one can have a nice meal and a tasty dessert all in one sitting.  Since it's open 24/7, it stays busy all the time, so you might have a hard time scoring a place to sit. Amelie's, like any coffee and dessert joint offering free wi-fi, has its fair share of squatters, which can be a drag when all you want is to enjoy a coffee and an eclair and a nice place to sit.   Still, perhaps a minor inconvenience for a major delight. Go to Amelie's now.",

You get Waffle House, McDonalds, a handful of gas stations and Amelie's French Bakery--not to be confused with the lowbrow 24-hour options of the past.  Amelie's is heaven on earth. Despite the loooong (looooooooong) line to pick out your pastries, the whole bakery is a wonderful place to be. There are plenty of seats, bistro seating with tiny tables and tiny chairs as well as overstuffed furniture to settle into with your laptop (for the free wi-fi).  Everyone will suggest to you that you get the salted caramel brownie. And you should, if you like your caramel poured on thick with a thin layer of brownie.

I love the decor in the sitting room and the cozy,  quaint feel of this place not to mention the varieties of sweet goodness.  The only drawback can be parking and finding a place to sit.  I recommend the salted caramel torte and the salted caramel brownie.  Can you say delicious?!!  Those were both of our favorites.  It is definitely a place to visit if you've never been there.  They are open 24/7!",

But you could put a little more effort into a smile, a thank you, a simple you're welcome goes a long way. I shouldn't be the one saying it first. With such an outstanding plethora of deserts you'd think some of that sweetness would rub off on the staff too.   Yes the desserts are magazine quality and I'm sure the food is too but the coffee had a lot to be desired. The roast they use is not one I would choose and tastes like a medium roast. Espresso drinks in my opinion should be a dark roast. But maybe that's how they do it in France? I'll pass on the coffee next time.   Oh and another tip don't sit in the hallway, the line will overtake you and takes away from the dining experience. Also you'll be bombarded with constant bags and butts brushing your chair.",

I asked for two coffees and they gave them to me in to go cups, whatever you guys do I don't care but I politely said that I didn't need the lids because I was having the coffee there (my bad for trying to reduce the plastic consumption) the barista gave me the worst look making me feel bad for saying no to the lids.

Being open 24/7 is a little weird, but obviously it works for them. I tend to frequent during more normal coffee-shop hours, but I've seen lines out the door at 10pm on Saturdays, so who am I to judge.  After reading through some of these reviews here and reflecting on my past visits, I guess they do have quite a few gluten-free options - the bread for sandwiches is great, and obviously the salted-caramel brownie is a winner. I'm one of those annoying Northeast transplants, though, so I'm used to being able to get the gluten-free version of literally anything; my first visit to Amelie's was a little disappointing in that arena, only because everything in the display case looked unbelievably delicious but was also flour-filled. Since that initial visit, I've realized that the wheat-free soups are a major find, and that Amelie's does make an intentional effort to cater to the obnoxious gluten-free customer.  Atmosphere is everything. I've posted many an Instagram photo from the lovely, cozy corners of this cafe. It's a beautiful place that NoDa is very lucky to have.",

All of the desserts and pastries are bomb that i have tried. Yesterday i was starving and wanted some breakfast food with a coconut chi tea espresso.Variety, is the perfect way to describe the menu and drinks here. Sometimes myself and friends when we feel like being big kids we will come eat and sit down and play some of the board games they have in there like checkers, and connect four to name a few. Alot of times you come here you will see customers towards the back  sitting or laying on the couches either doing homework for school or work on their laptop for work. Its very easy for me to fall asleep in here sometimes like i pretty much did yesterday lol the people,vibe,calmness,music just everything about this place puts me in a happy place/space. I remember when i first started coming here the only location i knew existed was this noda location. Now they are every where!",

I've tried a number of different treats here but my fav are the almond tea cakes! They are light, buttery with a crunchy top filled with almonds , really addicting! Every time I go I buy the WHOLE tray of whatever they have left, along with their BLT on a croissant and a chai tea latte w/ whip cream. The BLT never disappoints, the croissant is flaky and light and the bacon is baked til crispy. The chai tea latte is better than Starbucks, savory and lightly sweet with a hint of cinnamon.

First visit at 6:30am on a Sunday and only two other people are in the MASSIVE area with tables and chairs. The food looks beautiful, the coffee is hipster expensive and the bathrooms are labeled with signs about gender diversity - everything you'd expect from a coffee shop in NoDa. Call it Paris, call it NoDa but I call it a convenient place to work early on a Sunday morning (and a parking lot without charges).",

I loved the decor, the product selection, the beautiful case with all the goodies, they have great teas and fruit drinks, plus the lighting is very special and artistic.  I have tried many things here from the crunchy buttery croissants, the mini fruit tarts and I have had them all, the mini tea cakes, chocolate tarts, i always purchase macaroons in many flavors the colors and selection is wide and exciting.  They have meal options from fresh creative salads to what they call Tartines that are open faced sandwiches and my FAVORITE is the Fig with Bacon and Brie I can't tell you how many times I have ordered the full order and ate the whole thing in one sitting.  Every time I go I enjoy what I order and always try a new item from their case.  The only issue for me is if you do not hit this spot at the right time the line can be 20 or more deep while they do have a decent sized staff it is not enough to always handle the long line.  But you do get in and out with good service, great food and many things to look at.  They have seating indoor and outside and offer all ToGo and the containers are well thought out and your food gets home safe and sound and tastes great.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that is not watching their calories, loves pastry, loves sweets and wants to try some new fun tastes and flavors.  Again, this is a popular spot and there are a couple locations to check out.  A new one is coming soon and they are calling it their \"Flagship\" shop can't wait to check it out!",

The entire restaurant was spotless and spacious, adorned in French decor as far as your eye could see.   The atmosphere was so peaceful with a homely feel; sort of like a home away from home. It's a nice spot to connect to the free wi-if and just focus without distractions and the best part is it's open 24 hours!  Oh yes, and the food was awesome! We ordered breakfast croissants, pull-apart cinnamon bread and a cheese danish and everything was delicious. Amelie's is my new go-to spot!",

There is also a section of the restaurant that allows guests to view the baking magic in action! Super dope.   When I visited downtown Charlotte, I tried the fig tartine. I didn't know this at first, but a tartine is a sandwich with just one breaded side. This tartine had perfectly toasted bread, sweet fig, crispy bacon, and delicious Brie cheese! I enjoyed every bite! The portions were smaller than what I am used to, but it was perfect because I didn't feel overly full after lunch.",

It is impossible not to fall in love with the decor and cozy atmosphere. With more than ample seating it is the perfect spot to have a drink, prop open a book or your laptop, and have a wonderful time.   You could pick any one item off of the menu and you would not be disappointed! Service has always been exemplary and even when the line is out the door I've never waited too long to get my order. Among my favorite drinks are the French press coffee, salted caramel brownie cafe mocha, and the blueberry lemonade. As for treats, try the napolean, any of the tarts or macarons, the mini mousse cups, and the petit fours!",

GREAT FOOD AND DRINK whether you are getting just a sweet treat (which there are dozens of options), or feeling something a bit more \"remplissage\" they have a full breakfast and extensive sandwich menu.  2.  The atmosphere here is perfect, it's trendy, French inspired, and often times makes me smile or chuckle with how they pull it all together.  3.  They are open 24 hours.  Need some good coffee and breakfast at 4 am before a flight but don't want fast food?  They got you.  Been out in NODA drinking craft beer and want a tasty nightcap?  Come get a salted caramel brownie.  This might be my top place to recommend here in Charlotte.

From sandwiches to fresh salads to delicate desserts and my favorite coffee, Amelie's delivers on quality food and dessert.   My most recent trip was on a Friday night. It was packed. On this trip, we were looking for a tasty treat. Between the two of us, we got a couple of macaroons (chocolate, lavender and lemon), a chocolate cake and a twice-baked almond croissant. Simply heavenly!  I'm a sucker for plain chocolate and there's is a more dark chocolate, so it's not over the top sweet. I love the seasonal lavender lemon macaroon. A light flavor with a citrisy kick. I wish I had ordered tea with it. The cake was rich. The layers were light, but that chocolate ganache is to die for. The croissant was okay. It picks up an almost cake like texture, but this was hubby's choice. I highly recommend the chocolate croissant which is my usual go to.   If you are ever craving soup or salad, they have excellent choices.  This location does get a bit crowded. The line moves fast, though. And shout out to the girls working the dessert case who can help explain everything and share every macaroon flavor. We actually found a quiet table to sit and enjoyed ourselves.",

The fruit tarts were ok but not something I can't pick up at a local place. A good place to stop by once, maybe twice, but had better sweets else where.",

    "text": "I usually do not write reviews, but after having the experience I had with this company, i just had to share. Amelies's is one of the most unprofessional companies I have ever seen. Let me explain why. I am having a wedding this August, so my fiance contacted the company asking about wedding cakes. The email reply she received was very vague, and stating that we need to pay $15 to receive a tasting box. We could have a consultation after receiving the box. They did not tell my fiance' that we can not pay at the store. So my fiance wrote them back an email saying they should have told her that she could not pay at the store to receive the cake. They went on to make her feel like she was the one at fault and that she should have already known that they only take payment over the phone with a card for the tasting box. How are your customers supposed to know this information if you do not tell them?? If we can not pay at the store, then you should probably tell us this in the initial email. So after we pay for the cake sample box, we go to the store to pick it up and then after trying the cake, my fiance' wrote them another email to set up a consultation. So they only do consultations during normal business hours, which is fine. It is now Tuesday and we told Betonya that we could meet Friday after 2p and she emailed us back setting the meeting time at 3p. So we get to the store at 3p and ask for Betonya, The gentleman behind the counter goes to the back and comes back up front saying that she was not there today. We told him she set a meeting for us at 3p. He was nice and went back to find out what was going on. He came back and said that she was not feeling well so she is not here today. So did Betonya not find the courtesy to let us know that she was not going to be in today, or at least let someone know that we are coming? We live 45 minutes away from the store and to come to an appointment set by the company and then being stood up is very unprofessional. After telling the gentleman that we drove 45 minutes to get there and she had set the date and time, he went back again and came out with two ladies. They were going to do the consultation for us but said they would have to relay the information we talked about to Betonya before letting us know anything. We did the consultation with them and left. My major concern is the unprofessionalism displayed by Betonya by not informing her customers that she set a time up with that she would need to reschedule. Very disappointed with this experience. For this reason, I will not return, and will tell everyone I know about this awful experience.",

    "text": "Obviously this is a popular place (100+ reviews in CLT is quite an achievement) and from the way the reviews are showing, people just cannot get enough of Amelie's.  I have to agree... this is an unique place for Charlotte, well fitted in the NoDa area with its quirky parisian decor.  And it is open 24 hours, a fabulously chic alternative to the good ole around the clock dining options (which are mainly diners & \"Awful House\").  I mean, just because it's 2:30am and a girl is looking a little rough after a night out doesn't mean she is condemned to scattered, covered and chunked only.  I would have normally given it a 4-star, since I am a fan of the place and have enjoyed plenty of the mushroom & leek tartines... but I am feeling a little honest today.  Plus, being on a bandwagon has never been my style.  To be fair, I don't a sweet tooth.  The only dessert I had here was a creme brulee.  It was peanut butter flavor... probably my first mistake of trying an unconventional take of the classic.  It was NOT to die for; in fact the center was very cold and not creamy and we did not even finish it (we, as in 2 people, and normally I would chow down a creme brulee faster than you can say \"fatty\").  So... thumbs down from me... better leave dessert reviews to others.  But what really got to me was last night when I went there to study for my exam.  Knowing I would pull a late one, I figured I would order food when it got less crowded.  But before my seat was even warm, I was approached by an older man (owner?) because apparently I have committed the deadliest Amelie's crime of having a coffee cup from another place with me.  Sorry... I just didn't want to waste my perfectly made English Breakfast Tea with cream & sugar.  But instead of being friendly about it, he was blunt and rude. \"This is NOT my coffee cup\" is not going to make me feel warm & fuzzy about getting your coffee.  All I am saying is... a place like this supposes to make people want to stay & linger (and spend $ in the long run).  I know we are all here to make a buck, and I sure was going to (and did) spend my bucks there... it's ok to be nice about my existing (apparenlty illegitimate) drink.  A quick joke of \"I hope you're getting something to go with that drink?\" or even a nice \"sorry no outside cups are allowed\" would have conveyed the same message.  At the end, as much as this place is unique and hip and cool alternative for late night dining, I personally think the food has always been \"ok\" and slightly overpriced for what it is (this is after all NOT a restaurant).  Will I be back?  Likely yes.  But let's hope next time I won't get prosecuted for something else I am not aware of.",

The only downside is that it's crowded, so getting the \"right\" spot for you can be a little tricky. But once you add the amazing pastries, the atmosphere is almost a non-event. There aren't many places in Charlotte with this kind of selection. From dainty, low-guilt treats to huge pieces of cake, they have all the pastries you could ask for. The \"savory\" options are more limited and basic, but also very yummy if that's what you're looking for.",

Maybe the desserts taste better when you are drunk or you are a college student who typically lives off ramen. This seemed to be the type of crowd attracted to the place. It is a very eclectic-urban type place. Very artsy. While that does not bother me, I did not like how the location is right next to a club. Not at all a place that I will come back to. Le Madeleine is 100 times better sadly.",

The atmosphere instantly takes you into relax mode, this is an ideal place to study or read. They were out of a few items, which only shows the quality of the food and the freshness of the product- if they only order a minimum amount at once, you know that it's going to be as fresh as can be. The sandwiches were wonderful, but we found them lacking only in a side item. A small fruit or green salad, or an offer of a bag of chips would have made the meal seem complete. Instead, we went back and ordered a side salad and bowl of crab soup to share. The bowl of soup was a meal in itself, the portion was very generous, and incredible! It was a tomato-y bisque with a little heat and a good amount of crab, with a few slice of french bread. The salad we took togo, because the soup was too delicious to let go to waste. We also shared two of the mini key lime tarts which were fabulous! My only complaint would be that the pricing is a little high for single items, if the sandwiches/soups/salads came with a small accompaniment, I would have no problem with the pricing, because the food was delicious. Will return with a kindle on the next rainy day!  Visited Aug 2011",

It was so sweet I thought I'd have to stop after only 2 bites, but before I knew it the whole thing was gone.  I just couldn't stop myself!  The only drawback to this place was it was incredibly busy when we stopped by at 8:30pm on a weekday.  This is the type of place that I'd normally like to get a pastry and coffee and have a seat to relax for a bit.

As I stated in my review earlier, a friend of mine flew in from Philly so I called up all our college friends and we had our boyz night out.   After done at the EpiCentre around 2am, I decided to check out Amelie's since I was hearing so many good things about it here on Yelp. Also, we had to get buzz off before get home otherwise my friends would get in trouble ;)  We arrived at the bakery and I see mid 20s college kids hanging outside on a patio. Oh that reminded all our good old days but let's not go there!  We walked in and all I see is the greatest evil man kind ever made which is undesirable tasty so that we go back for more. I couldn't figure out what I should get and what I should skip so I ordered Chocolate Croissants, apple/peach/pear tarts and chocolate creme brulee. All I can say is, I was worried about what I am about to do to myself or my diet but I felt satisfied!  While having our satisfying desert, I couldn't stop thinking abt the decor and one of my friend mention that it's all made out of junk/vintage items. So I said, it doesn't matter as long as the presentation is perfect :)",

    "text": "Despite the fact that I never, never eat anything out of the amazing dessert cases, Amelie's provides a great bakery and coffeehouse experience. Good WiFi, and you can usually cozy up to a power outlet if you need to. The staff is typically young, and can sometimes come off with an unfriendly attitude (but maybe they are just shy/confused). The vibe is funky and sprawly, the coffee is good and if they are able to retain commited baristas, there is hope for the espresso as well. Having spent time and money in Parisian bakeries on many occasions spanning decades, Amelie's seems a bit pricey on the bakery side to me. But with it being such a rarity in Charlotte there is a supply/demand thing at work here that seems to justify the expense.",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  I do dig this gem of a cafe in NoDa, but more for the atmosphere than the baked goods (which I think could use some more oomph). I love the quaint decor, the antique mismatched chairs and spread out feel and the art on the wall. Students studying, a couple playing boardgames, friends catching up - Good vibe.   Coffee was good, thank goodness, I was dying for java. We sat outside in the atrium, sort of odd that they expand out because it doesn't seem a part of the cafe, but it's so quiet and open, I quite like that they have the space. We had a late lunch and ordered the ham and gruyere tartines. They were tasty, but too small!  Anyway, the main reason I went there was to check out the pastries since I needed dessert for a big family event that's coming up and had read so many rave reviews. The guy at the counter couldn't offer up any free samples (or a smile) but he did walk me through their wonderful looking array of baked goods to tell me what they had which was helpful. I was excited for the tasting and a bit sad that it didn't blow my mind. I sampled: Coconut macaroon - meh, a miss for me, I did not dig the sweetener/sugar that they used, I thought they were overpriced, and they were not at all reminiscent of the best macaroons I have ever had, in France.  Mini berry tart - I wanted to love it, it looked so cute, and it wasn't even too sweet, but it wasn't memorable either. Chocolate hazelnut tart - recommended by the guy at the counter, I had high hopes for this one, and the chocolate filling, although not really hazelnut-y was decent, but the crust was dry and hard and not ok. Mini fruit tart - this was the best of the lot, the crust was decent, the custard added moistness. But it didn't make me ooh or ahh either.   I am disappointed I can't use their baked goods for our event, but they just didn't wow me.  So to sum it up, It's a little out of the way for me, but if I lived closer I would definitely go there often. I was eyeing the chocolate croissant, one of my favorite all time pastries, and I will go for a larger sandwich next time, and maybe sample this salted caramel brownie that is so popular.   Charlotte needs more non cookie-cutter cafes like this.",

    "text": "First I would like to begin by saying \"TED is the man!!!\" and 'TEd for PRESIDENT!\". I guess you might be wondering exactly who \"Ted\" is. Well Ted works at Amelie's. He provides that type of customer service that is rare these days. Great listener and extreme professional!!! Last week was sort of a rough week for me. (Let's just say someone very close to be had a birthday on Tuesday and the anniversary of their death was Wednesday. Always two pretty rough days each year.) Anyway, do their best to try to cheer me up during those rough days. They know I LOVE the Vanilla Chiffon cake at Amelie's. When I got home from work I had roses, a cooked dinner and guess what?!! Yep. You guessed it! Vanilla Chiffon Cake from Amelie's!!! When it was time to enjoy my cake, I dug right in. For the first time in history, the cake was not good. I wanted to CRY! I thought about it for a moment. What was I to do? I have NEVER had anything from Amelie's that wasn't amazing. So, I took a chance and called. I was a little anxious because my mood wasn't the best and I was hoping not to get hassled. I called and \"TED\" answer the phone. He listened to my concern and immediately apologized for my dissatisfaction. He offered an immediate resolution that was beyond what I expected. (Remember, I have NEVER complained about anything at Amelie's so I had no expectations.) \"TED\" was pleasant, polite and attentive. At the end of such a heartbreaking day, \"TED\" provided a pleasant surprise. Might seem small to some, but he truly made my day! My daughter and I went back to Amelie's earlier this week and I had the pleasure of meeting \"TED\". I thanked him for the pleasant experience! He had no idea what he did for me that day, he was just happy to have the opportunity to provide superior customer service. He thanked me for my business and smiled as he welcomed the next customer. Ok, I was already in love with this place. But if Ted is the standard for their customer service, then I will continue to return. Amazing food AND amazing service? What more could you ask for? Get yourself to Ameilie",

Also, the food food is also quite delish! I always have their soups because they are immaculate.The chicken salad croissant is my favorite sandwich there, but the others I've tried are great as well!  Not only is the food good, the atmosphere is what gives Amelie's the whole package. Their eccentric and random decor really creates that vintage and artsy feel. The people I see each time I'm there ranges from hipsters to families to businessmen. One of the best perks of the place is that it's open 24/7!

Came specifically to this location for the flavor of bread pudding that day. Noel took my order and proceed to work on my computer. Bread pudding arrives and it's the wrong flavor. Took it back to the counter and she apologized and put another in the over for me. No biggie. But 40 mins go by and the correct bread pudding came. Go back and Noel says the kitchen forgot and it's burnt. Again she was very polite, put yet another in the oven and offered to bag one for the rode. 30 more mins pass, and the warm bread pudding never comes. Finally I gave up and took my cold bread pudding and made it at home. If it weren't for the staff's great attitude, this entire trip would've been a bust",

Even though the salted caramel macaron previously was my favorite thing I'd ever eaten, this time there was no salt flavor so it was a little boring.

The staff is very nice but not what I would call enthusiastic, kinda like walkers are waiting on you.  Maybe it's the long hours?",

I'm not a fan of \"Americanized\" french dessert, it's no where close to desserts in europe. I noticed that very commonly in the US, desserts tend to be way overly sweet. Their sandwiches on the other hand are actually very good, so is their bread. Customer service also is an issue to address, most of the staff is friendly and inviting, however a few are just utterly rude and think they are serving prisoners:S I don't get why though, cost nothing to smile for people.

Good for them of course but it was difficult to lock in a seat of 2 even at 3pm. I shared a fruit tart with a friend and it was good. It was not the best fruit tart I have ever had in my life but I did enjoy it. If the small cupcake sized fruit tart was closer to $3 instead of $5 I would probably come here a lot more often.

First off, the good:  - Salted Caramel Brownie (5 stars): the PERFECT contrast of smooth sweet/salty caramel atop a thin but dense (and slightly crunchy) chocolate brownie.  You must try this if you love either caramel or brownies! - Their creme brulee was delicious, and the fact that they flambe/torch it only when ordered so it's warm, fresh, and crispy was a nice touch.  - Finally, the chocolate eclair and mixed-berry tart were both very decent and I'd happily order them again.   The only downside is that it was abundantly clear that those long hours really diminished the quality of at least 2 of their items:  - The croissant: I had already ordered a few items so I wasn't planning to get anything else, but I'm a sucker for a great croissant and the lady at the counter said it was fresh baked that morning, so I happily ordered it expecting a soft, flaky, buttery snack. Unfortunately what I got was hard and dry; honestly, I've had day old croissants taste fresher than this!  I have no doubt that if it were fresh out of the oven it would have been amazing, but someone definitely wasn't keeping track of how old/dry these were. - The sticky-bun (mini cinnamon roll + raisins & extra sugar glaze on top): it also was was disappointingly \"aged\" liked the croissant, and although I've got a notorious sweet tooth, this tasted way too sugary too me.  Overall, I'd definitely come back for their delicious snacks/desserts that are not too perishable and to try their famous macaroons.  As for the disappointing croissant,  I'd be willing to try it again if I KNEW it was fresh, but otherwise skip it.",

Of all of them, I really liked the lemon tart and the sticky bun. After reading all the hype the Salted caramel brownie was okay... It's more caramel than brownie though. Felt like I was eating spoonfuls of caramel, and I LOVE me some salted caramel.  So what I did is take the salted caramel and put it on my sticky pecan bun.

    "text": "This is the place I always suggest to visitors! I always want to take them to Amelie's because of the different vibe, unique decor, and delicious food. It just seems to be a Charlotte staple.   I have tried several of the different pastries and desserts but I always end up landing back on the French Macaroons - my favorite: the pistachio (although I liked it better before they started adding the pistachio pieces on the outside, I think the extra baking of the pistachios changes their flavor). Anyway, I thought this was a great place to come and do homework when I was in graduate school, as it allowed for me to chill with my headphones or have group study sessions.   The tricky part is timing. I have gone in with no line, and I have gone in other times and the line is wrapped into the other rooms of the building. Seating can also be tricky as well due to popularity.",

The decor was pretty sweet and it just had that character you want in a good eatery. The guys working there are cool and I had a chat with 3 of them at different stages. All of them told me stuff to do around the area and were super chilled out humble guys.   I then ordered the orange blossom iced tea and sat outside in the sun. Brilliant tea paired nicely with the mild sun and I was having a ball.   Character and enjoyment, people! That's what it's all about! The only bad thing that happened is some lady ordered a diet coke haha. None of the workers mind that, you're free to make your own decisions after all, but shit that's a bad call, ordering coke when you have the craftsmanship of these people!  Respect to the people at Amelie's!  Enjoy!",

My girlfriend suggested that we check this place out after driving by it one day, and we haven't regretted that decision since. We will drop by Amelie's every once in a while to get our hands on their tasty eclairs. And sometimes, we drop by just to look around! The decor is phenomenal, and we would probably stick around longer if we weren't just taking up space. Yes, prepare to stand in a crowded room that follows after the skinny corridor!  And yeah, sure, the line was long. Even so, I'll give it a pass. Everything ran quickly and efficiently, and not once did I have to demand attention from the smiling young man working behind the counter. Great service in an unlikely place!",

For lunch I had their pate de campagne sandwich and asparagus leek soup. The pate was amazing. It had a nice bite and the pickles were the perfect match to the richness of the pate. The bread was amazing. The soup was ok. A tad too thin and salty. The best part was they served it with more bread. The brownies was really yummy. It was super fudgey and the salted caramel was tasty. I love the ambiance of the bakery. The vintage french vibe was cool. I would come back here again if I was in NoDa.",

The place is decorated with mismatched French-themed art and furniture, and the crowd Amelie's attracts is diverse as well.  I was visiting my cousin for the weekend, and we stopped by twice - Saturday night and Sunday afternoon.  Saturday night was packed with the line wrapping around to the other room (and I'm told it is usually busy like this during the later hours of the evening).  Sunday wasn't as packed but still busy with customers.  Saturday night I got the creme brulee, and on Sunday I bought a coffee and a variety of pastries to take home to Virginia Beach.  Next time I come, I hope to try some of their hot sandwiches and get a frozen baguette to bake at home.",

One night, my boyfriend and I decided to hop in here on a dreary Saturday night after being in the Plaza Midwood area.  I was in search of a latte and he had a sweet tooth.  While the line was about 8 people deep, it moved rather quick.  I've since learned that this number of patrons was an anomaly as the line is usually wrapped around the room.  Anyways, we tried the Salted Caramel Brownie that EVERYONE loves, a few Tortes and a strawberry croissant.  First off, they did not want to make a latte....not at all.  I don't blame them, it was not that good.  I don't think I was able to finish all of it.    We were not impressed with the brownie either, it was just a thick chunk of caramel plopped on top of a dry brownie.  Maybe we got a bad batch or something but it was not the \"raved\" about dessert that I was hoping for.  I had the same problem with their layered tortes....dry and not flavorful.  The croissant was....not the warm, buttery pastry that you would envision.      I would love to love Amelie's but I just don't.  I DO like the fact that it's open 24hrs. and I find it a good place to sit and people watch.  I plan on returning for a third time to try it once more, have a plain coffee and sit to work on some writing.",

The staff seems less than enthusiastic to serve their customers, it's quite disappointing. I still love the pastries and baguettes, but their soups and sandwiches are sub-par and very small for the price. What once was a very fun and inviting place has declined into just being a kitschy tourist stop.",

But, after 3 visits, I have tried several pastries and cakes and they are just ok at best and at worst kind of tasteless and spongy/heavy. The desserts are chilled and for some of them it makes them worse for the wear-- such as anything that is supposed to be flaky. Cute decor does not make up for mediocre sweets.   I have yet to try their lunch/breakfast offerings, so maybe this is what keeps other reviewers so enthused.",

Walking through the door you're greeted with an eclectic decor that I the only way I might be able to describe would be chic french hipster.  They have an interesting and varied selection of pastries and chocolates that were fun to look at and delicious as well! I went for lunch with a friend and she had the ginger rice soup, and I had the asparagus leek soup. I'm not a fan of ginger so her soup was ok, but the asparagus leek soup was excellent! Creamy and smooth it was a dream. We also split a croque monsieur and it was done perfectly. Greasy, a little crisp on the outside, with the mustard giving a nice kick to the sandwich.  Now for the dessert portion we had a strawberry and chocolate croissant, salted caramel brownie, and creme brulee with a small french press. I feel like the strawberry and chocolate croissants could have used a little more filling but they were quite good. The salted caramel brownie I really needed more salt to cut through the creamy sugar of the caramel, but then again I tend to like my snacks a bit less sweet. The creme brulee was the winner of the dessert round. Nice and crisply caramelized top with a not too sweet center.  Amelie's was a great find in the Noda area and offers free wifi, a nice place to relax, and a varied crowd with pastry choices for everyone. It's now on my list of places to visit frequently!",

It's really more than a bakery and once you check it out you will understand why I say this.   It's almost like hanging out at your cool (but eclectic) aunt's house who likes to whip up tarts, bear claws, breakfast sandwiches and more to tempt your tastebuds. I'm telling you about this place because you can treat it as an experience and swing by anytime to have an almost 9 1/2 weeks (remember that movie...HOT!) moment with a date or pick up treats for an everyday or special occasion.   By now your mouth should be watering. Just remember these delicious items could be picked up at anytime since its open 24 hours a day (winning!!).",

But a part of me also adore it because it is so unique.   Maybe I'm just a closest hoarder.  Came on the day of my flight back to NY, figuring that as a bakery that is opened 24/7, and I'm part of the church belt, it'd be sort of slow. Nope. I was wrong, thankfully the service was quick and I go the front of the line within 10 minutes or so.  I ordered a two macaroons, a mini berry tart, two bags of coffee, terragon & mint tea, and a roast beef sandwich. The tea itself was a bit on the disappointing side(should've just gotten iced black coffee). The tart, macaroons, and roast beef sandwich however, were very tasty. And still kind of left me wanting more.   I dug it. You bet I'll be back if I'm ever back in Charlotte again.",

However, this is not the place to go if you're expecting a big brunch-type meal.   The entrance and ordering line was a bit confusing on a Sunday morning around 11:30, but our ordering was quick and easy. I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a croissant, which needed to be prepared. We took up a large table for our party of 7. After sitting down, those of us that ordered sandwiches waited approximately 10 minutes before they were brought to us by one of the staff. I appreciate that they take the time to find and serve their customers, as opposed to having to go back up to the front to obtain your food. I saw one guy studying in a corner with some coffee, which made me realize that Amelie's is a much better alternative to Starbucks, if you're going for the coffee house vibe.  The breakfast sandwich (egg, sausage, cheese, spinach, on a croissant) was good, but nothing spectacular. I sampled a few of my friends' pastries which were tasty. I will go back, but only for a pasty or dessert.",

I tried the asparagus and leek soup and an open face sandwich, and then made sure to save room for a salted caramel brownie.  Everything was delicious.  The place is so cute too. I also appreciated that I got a refill on my ice tea.  I wish there was an Amelie's in NYC so I could frequent it!  Service wasn't overly friendly....but the food was great and the place was so adorable, I didn't care.",

I love that you can bring your laptop here and just nestle into a small corner or open area of the Bakery, plug laptop in, put headphones on and just cast all the noise away. This place is HUGE and you really can spread out as much as you want.   The service was OK - perhaps it was a busy day but I think it could have been improved. Reason One - Minus five star.  I ordered a bunch of stuff w/ coffee but the one thing i remember the most were the macaroons. They were not great, perhaps they were out from early morning? To be fair, I was there around 2PM-ish. They were just rock HARD. The coffee was ok, but Coffee in Charlotte overall is OK. Reason Two - minus five star ( hard macaroons).   I will definitely return but perhaps at an earlier time.",

This was my second time visiting as I never get get time to go during the week because of work but I was not feeling well and took the day off and decided to grab a quick breakfast.  I only got a latte and pain au chocolate (twice baked).  The Croissant was pretty good but I would love to try their other options.  The latte was good, but not the best I have had in Charlotte.  Overall I give this place 3 stars and not 4 because it is simply overpriced.  However, because the atmosphere here reminds so much of being back in France, I like it enough to return occasionally.  It has so many decorations and French paintings that it puts me back in the mindset.",

Get the caramel brownie.  There I said it.  You'll thank me later, but lets just get that out of the way.  What else you may want is up to you.  Plenty of soup, tartines, and sandwich options.  The soups change daily, so I can't really recommend any one in particular.  As far as the sandwiches go though, I'm a turkey and brie on baguette fan.  The roast beef and manchego is worth a try as well, and a great dipper in a french onion soup.  After you've ordered, take a look around.  If you go around to your left, there is a large open area with multiple seating options.  You can normally count on someone studying back there.  The atrium out back also has plenty of seating options and is quite a change of pace for Charlotte dining.  Wherever you sit, don't forget to bring your diner number with ya.  It can take a while to get your food otherwise.  Disclaimer:  Its normally after 2am when I eat here, so the food could easily be close to 3.5-4.5 stars and my munchies are just taking over.  Regardless, its still a great option for the late night.",

The decor is nice (we ate in some kind of atrium, a covered outdoor area, didn't love it), I'd recommend eating in the actual cafe, there's plenty to look at it (cool furniture, artwork, etc) and they play cool music.  Service is nice, we got some lunch here, a few tartines (European style open sandwich, just one baguette slice on the bottom), mine (vegetarian) with pesto, mozarella and tomatoes (I got half), my husband got the full tartine - the ham and Gruyere cheese one. They weren't as good as the ones I had in Paris, but they were decent. Nice choice for a snack, they have a great selection of European sodas (San Pellegrino, etc). We got some chocolate croissants for the next morning's breakfast (they were very good) and delicious chocolate eclairs to go (which were the best we had in a long time, the custard was just right).   Amelie is a cute place to hang out for breakfast, lunch, meet with a friend. If you live in the area or visit Charlotte, give it a try, it won't disappoint. Great selection of pastries, desserts, lunch choices, good prices and free parking.",

The macron was cold and hard, not soft and delectable. I couldn't even finish it, and that's not a good sign. The coffee was fine. Also nothing special, dashing my expectation for a delicious cup of French coffee. Went back the next day to try a few more things. The elephant ears had no taste. The tea cake was good. Honestly, Had hoped for more when I walked in given my past experience. It went from quaint good French bakery to giant just OK French bakery.",

In fact, most French people hate Parisians. LOL. I love Louis Vuitton leather goods, so maybe I would be considered haughty too?  C'est possible.  I love French food and wine, period.   French people shop for fresh bread and food on a (sometimes twice) daily basis.  They insist on fresh or the shop keeper will receive a \"tsk, tsk, tsk.\" French people demand BETTER - everything.  Enough digression.....what about Amelie's?  First of all, let me say that like: country living, farm to table, and barbecue's recent popularity with the masses - I loved Amelie's before Amelie's was cool.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com%2Fvideos%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Di%2Bloved%2Bcountry%2Bbefore%2Bcountry%2Bwas%2Bcool%26FORM%3DVIRE3%23view%3Ddetail%26mid%3D87AA32AA8D841EDA1A4787AA32AA8D841EDA1A47&s=02a6ee7b32bb8c61cb255df77fc5847b48b0b0b6d42441d62bc600d9cde3d955\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bing.com/videos/search?q...</a>  I like the decor and concept of Amelie's, more than I care for their execution.

When it's \"ON,\" there's absolutely nothing better. Nothing. C'est formidable. When it's \"OFF,\" and the sugar is improperly caramelized.  C'est dommage. Quelle disaster!  The same thing goes for their macaroons, which are frequently stale. Expensive and stale are two things that I don't equate or happily associate.    How is this possible with their constant horde of customers 24/7?  Vraiment?

I find this highly unethical, extremely saddening, and completely unnecessary. {SMH}  Despite my recent disappointments, Amelie's has a friendly, warm, inviting feel of a French cafe, and there's always the possibility that the salted caramel brownie will be properly made that day....so I always visit Amelie's when I journey to Charlotte to eat or shop.

A definite must try if you've never had them before. The chocolate eclairs are also very good and aren't overly sweet and heavy like some can be. As many have commented already the Carmel brownie is excellent!  The brownie consistency is a bit more dense than what in was expecting but it really worked well with the Carmel. Their drinks are pretty stellar as well. Try the lemonade, you won't be disappointed.   It's also good to know that they are open 24 hours. This may come in handy if you have a wife that's pregnant or you are fat like me and wake up dreaming of delicious deserts!  Mmmmmm brownies...",

The pastries are excellent though a bit pricey and the coffee is always good. So, the only reason for four stars instead of five is the price.

The line was quite long, but the employees had us placing our order in no time. I decided to order the Croque Monsier while my fiancee went with the Roast Beef & Manchego with a cup of Asparagus soup. We also got dessert. I would recommend that you save yourself a lot of grief and just always plan on getting dessert when you go to Amelie's. It is worth the added calories, and they will gladly box it to go. But I digress. The fiancee was pleased enough with her sandwich but admitted that she will order the Croque Monsier next time. Why? Because it was delicious! I got it on a croissant. The cheese was melty and the sauce was plentiful. Just a good sandwich. My regret: not ordering the soup! It was creamy and flavorful. I just hope they have it the next time as the soups are rotated. For dessert I got the seasonal eclair which was filled with caramel cream. Oh my goodness! I could have eaten a dozen! I honestly can't remember the name of her dessert, but it was very rich and tasty. This place is a must!",

From the cool decor and expansive layout of the restaurant to the vast selection of pastries, desserts, breakfast sandwiches and coffee drinks, it's the place to go whether you're hanging out with friends or looking for a trendy study spot (if you like a little distraction and noise while you study). This morning I just had coffee, but my mom created her own breakfast croissant with sausage, egg, tomato and cheddar cheese and absolutely loved it. Typically, I just visit for the delicious desserts but I definitely need to go more in the morning to check out their breakfast options, whether that's a sandwich, quiche or a pastry! My top desserts from Amelie's are: mini mousse cups, chocolate eclairs and the chocolate/raspberry and the mixed berry tarts. I wasn't too impressed with the Chocolate Petit Gateaux, however the presentation was impeccable! Overall, Amelie's is a must if you're visiting Charlotte and a great place to relax and people watch.",

The decor, while eclectic and probably not to everybody's taste, is amazing. Whoever decorated this cafe has a sense of humor, a good sense of color, and an eye for the bizarre.  But perhaps I should mention the food. The coffee here is great. Whether you prefer drip, french press, or espresso, your caffeine needs will be sated and sated deliciously.   The pastries are also very good. My personal favorite is the double-baked chocolate croissant, but the eclairs, tarts, and napoleons are all good. Everything just has to be tied, and I'm sure that after one trip, more will be made to do just that.",

    "text": "There are so many reasons I love Amelie's. First of all of course the food is amazing!  They have a wide range of French pastries and the variety is mind boggling. There is definitely something for everyone.  My favorites being the palmier and the raspberry fruit tie. They also have incredible tarts, eclairs, petit fours, mini cakes or gateaux, brownies, macaroons, etc.  Then there are the savory treats.  They seem to be most proud of their soups like the spinach asparagus leek and sweet potato bisque.  While the soup is pretty great and my favorite thing on a rainy or cold day I am in love with the baguette and croissant sandwhiches.  You can get them with ham or jambon, eggs, spinach, tomato, or cheese or any combination.  My favorite cheeses being a tie between brie and gueyere.  There is some outside seating but the inside is a virtual modern french salon with very chic and creative decor.  Amelie's has more than one location now, but the orginal on North Davidson is my favorite and it's open TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY!  I havn't even gotten a chance to mention free Wi Fi, lavander infused sparkling lemonade, and flourless chocolate cake so you will have to just go yourself and make your own discoveries!",

That being said, I actually liked the ORIGINAL Amelies a little better.  After they changed hands and branched out-serving sandwiches,etc, it lost some of its \"French bakery\" appeal for me.  My daughter really loved the luncheon meals and ate there weekly.  I found those to be rather overpriced and mediocre in my humble opinion.  But I never had a dessert item that I didn't really enjoy, my favorite being something called Napolean, which is so large and rich, even a sugarholic will get filled eating one!  And  reading another review about raspberry cream puffs makes me want to venture over and see if they still make them.  That reviewer didn't like them, but since I love anything raspberry I want to try one!  All in all, I believe I would like Amelies better if they only sold pastry items and coffee, and let the luncheon meals to other restaurants.",

It used to be fairly small, but recently they had a huge expansion and now they have lots of tables and seating.  So you can take advantage of the free wifi without feeling bad about taking up a table.  It's not a coffee shop, so coffee selection is limited to standard drip.  They do have french presses available which is pretty cool.  But don't expect Starbucks.  I would love it to see them eventually expand their coffee choices.  This is as good as it gets for Charlotte.",

The spinach artichoke leek soup is the very best soup I have ever tasted and I'm usually twice the age of the average patron...every pastry and sandwich I have had has been great, truly. What holds my rating back is the service, it's consistently off, my order is consistently wrong and the last straw was last weekend I waited 30 min for a sandwich. I like Amelie's a lot but not that much. They cannot handle the crowds with the current staff. That might fly in Paris but here in the good ole US when I'm dropping $45 on lunch and snacks they need to step it up.",

The fresh fruit and cheese danishes are possibly the best danish I've ever had in my life, whatever time of day I happen to eat one...in the morning, in the evening, whatever.  I've tried a couple of the sandwiches -- the seeded roast beef is particularly good, but the pate with cornichons is also none too shabby.  I bought some gluten-free baked treats for a friend of mine who suffers from that tragic non-bread-eating disability, and she loved them, which makes me really appreciate that Amelie's cares enough to provide some options for everyone.   And the decor is awesome, and it's not too far a stretch to imagine just hanging out there all the time, although I wouldn't want to contribute to the scarcity of tables.  Everything's a little spendy compared to some of the other bakeries around, but it is actually that much better, so there you go.",

    "text": "Finally! A 24 hour joint in Charlotte! I was introduced to Amelie's by a friend of mine and I am thrilled she did. I go to Amelie's once a week to catch up with girlfriends over coffee and delicious (and fattening) pastries and desserts. I adore the fact that it is always open and the employees are incredibly nice and helpful. They carry a wide variety of desserts and fresh pastries. They also carry breads, sandwiches and soups. I brought home a baguette a few weeks ago and by morning, it was no where to be found! It is a really unique and fun place to go with friends. They are constantly busy so be prepared to stand in line but it is definitely worth the wait. A word of caution: even though everything is made in the bakery and around the clock, not everything is as fresh as you think it might be. The cakes are refrigerated to keep fresh and cool which can make it difficult to eat and not always very enjoyable. I would probably stay away from those unless you see it come out and you know it was made recently. I recommend the tarts and the tea cakes. They offer quite a few mini desserts so it's easy and cheap to try many things at once without feeling like a gluttoness pig who just lost all their money. Amelies is definitely worth the trip even if it's just to stop in for a cup of coffee!",

    "text": "This is my favorite bakery of all time (and I have tried many!). I think that the constant crowd at all hours of the day is proof that this place is amazing! When I first walked in, my eyes almost glazed over and my salivary glands kicked into overdrive at the sight of the very long glass display case of pastries. They were all beautiful and obviously artfully made by people that know what they are doing. If you couldn't find a pastry here to completely satisfy your visual and gustatory senses, there might just be something wrong with you. Also, the eclectic feel is very welcoming and sure to make you feel like have teleported to Paris. But don't be fooled, it isn't just the pastries that have people coming back to Amelie's, the actual food is to die for too! I have tried the ham and gruyere tartine and the sweet potato soup. The tartine had the perfect amount of very good quality cheese and the baguette that supported it was crispy but delicious. It is also a perfect portion and not very expensive. The soup was very smooth and had a perfect balance of flavors. I love sweet potatoes and I think they nailed this variation of sweet potato soup. It is perfect for a cold day! I tried the vanilla eclair and an assorted fruit mini tart. The tart was the perfect size and there were so many varieties that all looked picture perfect and fresh. The crust was not too sweet but perfect to compliment the custard interior and the fresh fruit on top. The chocolate eclair was very large and not quite the shape of others I have had before. However, the custard was delicious and there was lots of it! You can even have an eclair customized for Valentine's Day which I might be requesting next year. I have heard that the salted caramel brownie is out of this world from all of my friends and I will definitely be making the trip soon to try this and a few more of their pastries! I hope to become an Amelie's connoisseur!",

Napoleon thought I could share but the top crust is so hard, it is tough to cut n the cream spreads everywhere.  Apple tart was ok, eggclair n cream puff were probably a few days old n nothing to brag about.  The lemon tart w raspberries was sooo good and there were some other treats w sugar that were perfect.  Now that I have consumed so much sugar, I will  give you 3 stars because  I will be working it off for days and it was not all worth it and is overpriced.  Try it if you are in the area but not worth 30 minute drive.",

I cannot get enough time at Amelie's, especially with needing to study late night or sit, sip, and read. In my opinion Amelie's is institution worthy. Although, my wife may start complaining I stop by too often and pick up dessert, even though; she does not complain in the moment.  I do not know who makes the pastries and desserts there, but they have eclectic style of simplistic originality that excites the mouth.",

Warm, inviting, bohemian little seating arrangements and french provincial armchairs make me wish I was a student again so I could come and drink coffee and study here for hours.  I was there on a monday night and still couldnt secure a seat anywhere that I could even faintly hear the live music.  They should have a few smaller and easier to move chairs in there so people could actually sit.  They directed me towards the hallway or atrium I guess they call it?  But I didn't show up to sit in the atrium.  Probably won't go very often because of the seating problem, if you cant sit on a monday night there is little hope for any others.  The cake I had was Meh.  It was one of those that I thought had actual frosting that turned out to be that glorified whipped cream.  But it is a total charmer and worth going  once.",

There are a few cool ones here and there, but none of them seem to be open past even 9pm!  24 hours is superb!  (already used up my lifetime quota of 3 exclamation points and I don't care!)  I had just eaten when I arrived, so I didn't sample any of the delectable desserts, but they all looked superb.  The price for a coffee was totally reasonable and comes with one free refill.  All the creamers and condiments you could desire are there for you as well.  I had a \"sipping chocolate\" which was quite good and satisfied my multi-year cravings for a (evil) Starbucks Chantico which they discontinued (eviler).  There is plenty of seating, which is crucial since the place is pretty busy.  The design is very eclectic - you'll see if you haven't been there before.  I'm really excited to have found this place and will definitely be back very soon.",

The staff at NoDa are always very friendly.  There are lots of great bakery treats and I enjoy the brewed coffee.  WiFi normally works well.  This place can get busy with a line at the counter, and sometimes it can be hard to find a seat.  Speaking of seating, this place is definitely not your typical Starbucks or Coffee Bean.  Furniture is all what I'd describe as \"Old World\" style with lots of couches, one or two large tables, and several small tables.  Amelie's is designed more for socializing with others than it is for entrenching with a laptop but you will find both there.  One of my favorite features is that they are open 24 hours!  My only potential gripe is that occasionally the place can exude a little bit of a less than clean feel.  This is more the effect of the decor than anything, and food preparation has always been of a high standard.  I highly recommend everyone give Amelie's a try!",

They stay open late on gallery crawl nights (first and third Fridays) and are hoping to get their wine license.

I'm sure there are way tastier (and less expensive) offerings around the QC. Don't get me wrong--it's really pretty in there.

I ordered three shots of espresso and was instantly told that their shots are double shots and therefore what I was actually ordering was six of there's. I said sure, no big deal. It's all semantics in the end I assumed. However, upon receiving my \"six\" shot, I was given no more than 1 ounce of espresso and I had paid 7 dollars for this drink. When I questioned the quantity of my drink I was told that what I had actually ordering were ristretto shots. Fair enough. However, given the general volume of an espresso shot, 1 ounce, cut in half for ristretto, for me to be told I'm getting six shots, the math was all wrong. I was given less than a pleasant response when I questioned them about it. After she offered me another one, and I said please, I offered a little more money to compensate for my potential ignorance. I was greeted with a very snide remark of \"you can keep your money\" and the drink was slammed down in front of me. My fiance had been begging for me to join her there ever since I moved here. After that experience, considering that I work in the industry, I will never be back. Nor will I ever recommend my family or friends visit. I've heard rumors about how awful their customer service is. Too bad it's True because the croissant I ordered was the best I have ever had. The atmosphere was incredible. Even though I wasn't thrilled about my coffee, the flavor was amazing. Customer service was a zero. Therefore two stars.",

Their coffee is excellent, sourced from a roaster spun-off from Dilworth Coffee and prepared masterfully by their baristas.  I've had their drip and their European Latte, both of which were superb.  Their bakery offerings are top-notch as well.  We have had a number of their goodies, but none stand out as much as the macaroons - those things are outstanding!  I recommend the Pistachio and Cinnamon-Chocolatey ones above the rest.  The sitting area is large, uniquely decorated, and inviting.  Despite massive crowds, I have never had issues finding a place to set up shop (a word to the wise - around back you can take advantage of seating in the shared atrium, which is key when they are busy).",

I figured this was a sign that it was a good cafe/bakery. The first couple times I went, I bought an assortment of pastries to try - most were pretty great. I had given some to my parents to taste and my mother insisted her birthday cake come from there (I live 90 minutes away so this wasn't exactly easy planning.)    On my next trip I purchased several french macarons and after getting them home, discovered a small hair sandwiched into 1 of them. I emailed Amelie's through facebook to explain what happened just to let them know someone needed to be a little more careful. I received an email back from Lynn profusely apologizing (including the same formatted apologies I've seen from her in response to some reviews on here) and offering to make up for the mishap. She gave me a separate email address to contact her with additional information. I emailed her back at the address she provided and told her I didn't want anything for free (I assumed the apology and promise to check their procedures was sincere) - and only wanted some help picking out a birthday cake for my mom as I was short on time. I never received any response. I followed up a few days later on facebook to see if she got my email and again, no response.  I sent a 3rd and final email December 26th (3 months after the fact) and finally got a response 8 days later apologizing for dropping the ball and offering a gift card to make up for it. I received another email this morning because she forgot to copy the gift card person on what happened.  Really? This is a comedy of errors that just isn't all that funny so I won't be back.",

    "text": "I think this review is going to be along the same lines as everyone else. I was hankering for some sweets late at night, ok it wasn't that late, maybe 8 or so, and I looked for some dessert spots. Turns out we weren't too far from Amelie's French Bakery.  I hate parking so I looked them up on Google Maps before heading out and saw they had a parking lot right in front so I figured it wouldn't be too bad and I was right, we found a spot right away.   The line was long. It did wrap around and through 2 rooms. It also moved fast. I timed it, because why not? It took 25 minutes from walking in to walking out. That's not bad at all. I got to hear a lovely (not) conversation behind me, so it was interesting to say the least. The space is super cute and cozy, though we got ours to go. I can see why people would like to come here and work or hang out with friends.   We ordered a variety of desserts. Lemon & raspberry meringue; salted caramel & espresso torts; salted caramel brownie; 2 macaroons; 2 chocolate croissants for the following morning. The best thing was the Lemon & Raspberry meringue. The worst things were the macaroons. The torts were excellent and the salted caramel brownie was just okay. The croissants were pretty good though.   I think I am biased though. My heritage is French and my mom is an excellent baker, so things first get judged by how my mom makes them and secondly by a place in my hometown that made a croquembouche for my wedding, who is directly from France. His macaroons are the best things I've ever had. I think my expectations were too high for a place that is always packed and is open 24hrs. I think their quality suffers because of the quantity they need to produce to keep up with demand.  It did however meet the \"late night desserts\" urge that I had!",

I've had the soup and half baguette before too, which hit the spot late at night.   Another perk of Amelie's is that they are open super late so you can do work until late into the evening or stop by for a midnight snack. There's ample seating and the building seems to extend forever. The decor is also eclectic and unique, with mismatching furniture, couches, and fun wall decor.

I'm not too amped on going to Amelie's.....really at all. If you've never been, check it out. If you're visiting from out of town, it's a must. If you're into kitschy decor, by golly, what are you waiting for? If you're into good pastries, look elsewhere.   When I first moved to Charlotte, we were all about this joint. Board games, open 24/7, ample seating (inside and in the atrium of the 28th Row), and plenty of caffeine for late-night work sessions. So why 2 stars? Apathy.   The service is just abysmal and the product(s) tend to suffer the consequences as result. The trendy little kids behind the counter \"go out of their way\" to serve you and, dare I say, ask \"who's next\" in line. There are plenty of things right with Amelie's. Get some staff that actually KNOW the products, give them a little more love, and then put them in front of people. Every time I've visited, which has been sparse in the past few years, I've been in line with newbies. They should be swept off their feet as soon as they make eye contact with the staff. But, instead, I've seen them met with obligatory welcomes and blank stares.   Upon our last visit, we went with some go-tos -- Vanilla eclair and the chocolate croissant. Both were kinda blah. Dry, had been sitting in the case for what tasted like a good two or three days, and aren't what they used to be. You know....as long as the salted caramel brownie stays the same, I'm a happy camper.   I still love you, Amelie's. You'll always have a place in my Charlotte-loving heart, but your service is just less than desirable.",

When I first went, I was impressed. Good quality kitschy decor, embodiment of NODA. Now it's just average. I know that it is difficult to find a good bakery in Charlotte, but they have become \" just another place.\" I'm just saying.",

We had the chocolate and cream cheese croissant, Creme brulee, yogurt w/ fruit & granola, a mini lemon meringue pie w/ a raspberry, and two cream puffs! This was my treat to my daughter, so we ate a sample of everything and the rest will go home with us to be enjoyed later.  Tip: If you are not concerned for the time of day you go, plan to go before 6PM. We went on a Saturday at 10PM and there was a line wrapped through the entire place and out the back door. We left. We went back on Sunday morning at 9AM and no line at all. A local told us every night starts to build up starting around 6, so if you go at night, just bring some friends and expect to hang out.",

Because is a very popular place it will usually be crowded. To add to the space problem there is a bunch of unusual item (night stands, mannequins) that don't really add decor but take up space.

When I can do the food both the petit fours where phenomenal and I will probably come back again and try more of them.  The salted caramel eclair was good I wasn't particularly impressed, although I could see doing many other people takes far more than mine considering I usually prefer something of the sort to be a little more \"fluffy\", similar to a doughnut for lack of a better way to describe it.  However that is personal preference and says nothing against the eclair for eclair lovers.  I will definitely repeat in the future to try some more of their pastries.",

I'd really didn't want to leave.  The girl behind the counter who helped me was so friendly and made me feel very comfortable. He told me her favorites and explained each dessert I had questions for. So yes, service was amazing.  I really wanted to get one of everything but I ended up getting one of each flavor in the French macaron which were jalapeno, mixed berry, orange, lemon, dark chocolate, raspberry, pistachio, & rose water and then a salted caramel brownie. The macarons were amazing! The macaron shells were perfect. So tall, pretty large, colors so vibrant, smooth shells, no air pockets, and filling weren't too sweet. The jalapeno one was super weird because I could definitely taste the jalapeno but the heat didn't come. It didn't taste bad, just weird to me but I'm glad I got to try something so different. The brownie was AMAZING!!!  I don't care if I live almost 3 hours away, this place is worth the drive to come back again and again.  P.S. They offer military discount!

Some of them were knowledgeable, and others just don't care. I asked one worker what the flavors of the chocolate cups were. She said, \"I don't know\". I waited and then she started guessing on a few of them but trailed off. I pointed at one, and I said, \"The one with the almond. Is that almond?\" and she said, \"Yeah, I think so.\" I think her name was Mac. I wish she had a nametag on that said, \"Don't ask me\". She could have also easily asked the guy next to her.  I highly recommend the chocolate cups. My favorite was the passion fruit one. And the French macaroons (macarons)... sooo good. I prefer the cream ones and my favorite was pistachio. I didn't like the cinnamon-sugar one - too grainy. I wish I had bought a gazillion and stuffed them in my suitcase to bring back with me.   Go here! You will not regret it.

My husband and I ended up at this place looking for a bite to eat when we were in this area of Charlotte visiting breweries. I am really glad we did!  Besides the fun and girlie decor, the first thing that caught my eye here when we entered was the long pastry case. I am a huge fan of desserts and I almost wanted to skip lunch and go straight to the desserts.  However, I ended up ordering the turkey and white cheddar croissant and my husband settled on the roast beef and mozzarella sandwich. There were lots of sandwich choices that appealed to me on the menu.   The turn-around time from when we placed our order to when our food came out was pretty quick. My sandwich was good and my husband liked his as well. I will say a small pet peeve of mine is when places serve sandwiches without sides and this was one of those places. I did enjoy my sandwich but if I had been hungrier I'm not sure it would have been filling enough.  However, for that, there is always the French pastries for dessert. On this particular visit, I resisted the desserts knowing I would be drinking beer soon, but next time I will be sure to pick up a salted caramel brownie or a few of the macaroons.  We will be back!",

I guess I'm just not a fan of french baked goods or whatever because I've yet to be blown away by anything I've tried so far. I have ordered a variety of things and haven't been impressed with any of it. I seriously think that maybe I just don't like french cuisine due to the ENORMOUS amount of people that love this place.   It's always packed to the gills and that's saying a lot because the establishment is huge. I do enjoy the way it's laid out and decorated. Very artistic and mellow. It reminds me of an on-campus college eatery of sorts. It also attracts a lot of early twenty somethings and of course when that happens, I think it's pretentious and overrated because I hate conformity. Maybe that's why I'm lonely. I go here to sip a cup of coffee and glance from behind my teacup at the potential friendships I may develop, only to realize I'm a disappointment in everything I do and that no one will ever truly understand or love me. So I choke down the sandwiches of hard bread. I apathetically chew the crescent roll pastries until I grow bored with it, half eaten, growing more and more stale by the second. Stale like this life I've sluggishly and lethargically meandered along, awaiting for my hope and faith in humanity to renew. Envious of all those smiling and content faces that reflect success and happiness. They get what they want and they love it here, but it makes me depressed. Won't someone give me a hug? I mean, is it the beard? Should I shave it off? I like my beard though. I guess I'll have to settle on me liking the little things about myself since no one else like anything about me. Even my girlfriend settled on me. It's becoming more obvious every time she just nods at my attempt at humor, unsmiling, eyes screaming out for help too, in hopes that some 24 year old Vespa driving French man, or woman even, thanks to me, will come rescue her from this life with me that she never in a hundred years would have envisioned when our romance was still fresh. It too has grown stale.    So yeah, that sums up how I feel about this place.  UPDATE: Since the customer service woman of Amelie's gave me an internet hug, I feel the need to update my rating from two stars to three. This place, and my life, are A-OK now. I see the sun shining through the clouds and my girlfriend set up a menage a  trois with her new French girlfriend and I, which by the way has been surprisingly nice so far... she's a real sweetheart... so all is well.",

If you go at night the line wraps around the store and it's not very organized. The napoleons are the best, but more often than not they are right out of the freezer, so you have to take it home and wait for it to get good. The macarons are good and not too expensive. Overall I recommend it, but not during peak hours",

When I spoke with them they told me that's how they like them cooked. The people are kind and welcoming.  But it tends to get a bit loud in there so I like sitting out in the hallway behind the shop, and the WiFi is slow there, so it's great for social get together's.",

I came to Charlotte for work and I told by everyone that this was likely the best bakery in Charlotte, with some of the best coffee. I have got to say that Amelies is a good bakery and it's definitely worth a visit. However, I can certainly attest to having better coffee at 7th Street Market and know at least 2 bakeries in Durham, NC that have better pastries and bread by a LONG shot.  To the average person who's use to WallMart croissant this is certainly a breath of fresh air - but don't be mislead into thinking this is the best of the best!",

    "text": "\"too sexy for Milan, too sexy for New York and Japan\"  That old 80's song pops into my head every time I walk into this place. It's so hip it hurts. It's been riding the wave for several years, based solely on being the only \"French\" cafe in town, not counting Cafe Monte, another faux French establishment. It's also located in a \"very edgy\" part of town, meaning there are non-white people on the streets.  The coffee and pastries are nothing special. You'd think they were ambrosial given some of the reviews but you can get better at Whole Foods. Even so, I'd still make the drive, except for the abysmal service, as it does make a nice change from the claustrophobic suburban paradise that is Charlotte.   It can take them upwards of 30 minutes to make a sandwich. Heaven forbid that you should ask that your pastries be boxed, rather than crammed into a bag. Yes, you say, but it's a French bakery, doesn't the attitude go with it? Frankly, no. I've been to French patisseries, in France, in US and European cities. I've yet to encounter the attitude I've experienced at Amelie's.  Go if you are bored out of your mind, as it is open 24/7, but don't make a special trip for the food. It really isn't that special.",

It's easy to spend a lot of money when you want a variety, but each item is very affordable. I've never been disappointed in their desserts, especially the salted caramel brownie Yummmm!! The lavender lemonade is also amazing, I thought lavender would be gross in a drink but it tastes as wonderful as it smells. The sandwiches are so-so, but I usually go with the intent of having dessert and dessert only.  Second, the ambiance is fantastic. I love the French/shabby chic motif they have going on over there, and marvel at it every time I visit. I always notice something different and wish my apartment was as adorable as this bakery.  Third, the service is just as great as the food and ambiance. I hosted my graduation party here last year, and the staff (especially Stephanie) took just great care of me! The cost is fairly reasonable, and I was able to bring in my own food/wine which was a huge plus. Even when dropping by for a quick visit, the staff is always friendly and eager to answer any questions you have about the items they have.   If you go after a big event in town or late at night, expect the line to be very long. It can seem daunting, but it usually moves pretty fast. Even if it moved slower than molasses, the food is SO worth the wait!",

This time, there was a live band playing. Had a difficult time in deciding which dessert I wanted, but the wait staff were helpful and patient. I ended up choosing the Ganache and Raspberry jam tart, the ganache and raspberry part were delicious but the crust was too dry. Tried the Key Lime tart and loved it, again the crust was too dry, but the lime flavor really came out in the filling. Also tried the chocolate mousse cup, didn't really enjoy this one, mousse filling was tasty, but the chocolate cup threw it off.   I'll have to come back often to try more goods.

Nevertheless, the staff moves quickly and it's worth the short wait!  Amelie's pastries are adorably ornate and match the cute decor perfectly. Their famous salted caramel brownie lives up to the hype with a rich brownie layer, a crunchy sugar layer, and a soft caramel layer on top. Their Creme Brulee is equally delicious, and their savory items like croissants and sandwiches are also quite a treat.   With two locations in the Charlotte area, Amelie's is a must!",

Of course I had to try this. I have tried most the menu here and this was the first time I was ever disappointed. Amelie's is quality and fresh ingredients-  consistently.  You must try the salted caramel brownie - that goes without saying. Their soup is divine as are their sandwiches both breakfast and their more lunch/dinner options. This place oddly enough is the calmest during the day and morning. Around 7pm this is when the line goes out the door to past 2am. Three years of eating here and I just witnessed their first misstep.

    "text": "6/8/12  All that we tried from here were simply terrific!  If our next visit is just as great as our first, I'm sure I wouldn't have a problem bumping my rating up to five stars.  :)  So, why not give five stars outright?  I'd have to say it was due to my slight disappointment in the atmosphere...  We came in and were immediately greeted by the cashier at the counter, which was situated right in front of the entrance and to the right of the pastry display cases.  The coffee preparation area is behind and to the right of the cashier.  All of this served to show just how busy the staff members were: the pastry chefs working in the back, who would come out to deliver fresh-baked goodies and refill the cases, the cashier taking orders at the counter, a couple of people manning the coffee area (preparing espressos, lattes, mochas, and French presses, just to name a few), and a few more going in and out of the kitchen preparing sandwiches and other items.  This gave the place a bistro feel.  I suppose I was expecting a little more laid-back and romantic cafe, with an in-house bakery in the back- I quickly got over it.  Amelie's is a patisserie with a cafe attached to it.  We sat ourselves at the set of love seat, chairs, and coffee table across from the cashier and the bakery's entrance, so for the most part of our meal, my views of the pastry cases and the rest of the cafe were blocked by lines of people ordering and paying at the cashier-- not conducive to a relaxing breakfast/brunch.  I kept wishing there was a wood panel screen between our table and the traffic of people to give us some privacy.    Since Mom and sis had no idea of what to order, I decided to start us out with some coffee and chocolate croissants.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=HDYOAV5vs4XcZ6w78MUhJA#HDYOAV5vs4XcZ6w78MUhJA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z...</a>  Everyone wanted coffee, including me, but I also wanted to try AFB's mocha, so I ordered a large French press (serves 3 or 4) and a mocha latte.  I expected traditional style croissants, so AFB's slightly disappointed me presentation-wise, but as long as the pastries taste delicious, I don't mind, and these croissants were terrific, and they also kept well for the next two days through our vacay in FL.  Among the boxed pastries we took to go <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=9vjplh1WbJP09ORFska_Yw#9vjplh1WbJP09ORFska_Yw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z...</a>, I really loved the eclairs, which also kept well.  I thoroughly enjoyed the bite through the outer bread layers to find the chocolate filling; It was amazingly creamy and light, yet not fluffy (I don't do fluffy), and the eclairs stayed fresh through numerous times of refrigeration and thaws.  My sis enjoyed her bites of one salted caramel brownie, but interestingly enough, didn't eat the rest of it, nor touch the second one.  They seemed very rich...  I also enjoyed the Napoleon's crunch and buttercream-textured custard filling, but for fear of clogged arteries, I think I'll stay away from now on.  :)  As for the savory selections, sister and Mom absolutely LOVED the chicken salad sandwich!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z6zr_49LocyCTvSFg0w?select=TF7ywxMfFxd18pZlDheguw#TF7ywxMfFxd18pZlDheguw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/gG9z...</a>  Mom and  I really enjoyed the ham and gruyere tartine-- I loved the crunch of the toasted baguette and thought the saltiness of the cheese and ham paired well with the sweet-goodness of my mocha and croissant.  Yes, we've all decided to make AFB our first stop from the airport on our trips back to the Queen City!  p.s.  Amelie's is open 24/7!",

Late night when I needed a treat, it was off to Amelie's, and totally worth waiting in the line that wrapped around the restaurant.  It's also a great Saturday morning spot to sip coffee and read (if you're lucky enough to find seating).  So, why 4 stars and not 5?  It's a bit pricey.  It's delicious for sure, but you end up spending a lot of money because the cheaper items are still overpriced and small.  Also, I sadly developed a gluten allergy and while I enjoy their tea cakes, mousse, salted caramel brownie, and macaroons, obviously I wish there were still more options.",

During busy times the parking lot is a nightmare, and the line at the pastry case winds through the back of the restaurant. The food is generally good, albeit a tad pricey. I used to be a regular latte drinker here, but after a couple of months of inconsistency and slow service early in the morning I found a new coffee shop. The Noda location is one of a kind. In True Noda fashion it's a bit grungy, but I suppose that's part of the allure.  Other Amelie's locations feel like a completely different concept--stuffy and sterile--and cater to a completely different clientele. This is a fun place to take out of town guests.",

I'd say it's a solid A-Ok on the verge of 4 stars!  After waiting in line for what felt like forever, we finally reached the counter (Joy!). Angels started singing and a variety of pastries were revealed. I personally tried a macaroon, a salted caramel brownie and a lemon meringue torte. All were good, but I wouldn't say any were excellent. I found the macaroon to be a little on the dry/hard side and the (gasp!) chocolate caramel brownie to be a bit over-rated (I would have liked more of a salty flavor in the caramel). The lemon meringue torte was cute and tasty and was a little sweeter than I expected it to be (I prefer a little more tang).  The decor was a tad creepy in an Alice in Wonderland way, and I couldn't quite decide if I liked it or would find it unnerving over a longer visit. Also, I think the line could be more efficient if there were menus with pictures/descriptions customers could look at prior to reaching the counter.   I'd come back again and would try some different items, but I'd also try to time it better so as not to hit a rush (which seems like it may be challenging given the popularity of Amalie.",

Yes the pastries are a little less artisanal now, but give them credit for the ability to scale up and produce a crap ton of desserts and food at all hours! It's still legions better than alot of commercial baked goods.  There is plenty to choose from even at 1 am, prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is great.  For best quality I would stick with the originals, including the salted caramel brownie, napoleon and mini gateaus. I wasn't too impressed with the macarons or smore pastry, the espresso was very decent but too sour for my taste.",

This is not an easy patissiere to present to the public in a coffee house aesthetic.  I chose a blueberry and cream cheese muffin. The batter was not too sweet and the topping was a good balance. The blueberries tasted great but there were too many in the muffin itself, ruining large sections by over-moist sections. A.  I asked for the fruit Danish and my server recommended the fresh strawberry instead which I instantly accepted. The pastry was spot-on, very impressive. The sliced strawberries had a lovely freshness which was accented and not over-powered by the glaze. The texture of the pastry was light and flaky and the edges had that satisfying crunch. A+  My happiest moment was when I asked my server, fully expecting a \"Duh\" response, if \"They had French Press.\" Almost nobody knows this, and I expected this reply. The reply I got was to show me two different sizes and to ask if I preferred dark or medium. Dark French Press Coffee from a staff who knows what they're doing.

    "text": "Amelie's offers two of my favorite things, pastries/tarts and coffee, but this location offered me one of me least favorite things, terrible customer interaction and service. The employees at this location are some of the rudest bunch I have encountered. When I arrived, there were no labels on any pastries and after asking to be helped we said that we were waiting for them to be labeled, they did not offer to tell us what they were. When they finally began to label after 5 minutes, we asked what kind of cake they had and two of the employees got into an argument about one not knowing what kind it was. While continue looking, three employees congregated up front to talk very loudly and poorly about one of their fellow employees and her work ethic. After finally getting up to the register and asking about their two blends of coffee, the employee was very rude and unhelpful, all I had asked was what kind of roast and its strength, she laughed and said \"I don't know\", so I ordered two of the same kind and she had asked if I wanted any room for cream or sugar and I politely and simply said \"No thank you\", I then hear her make a remark of \"Of course not\" to another employee and they both laugh. After finding a place to sit I realize the weight of my coffee seems very light and disproportionate to the size I got, so I decided to pop open the lid, low and behold there is almost 2 inches of room in each of the coffees I had ordered. I had immediately became disgruntled and walked back up to the counter and caught glares from the woman who rung me up and poured my coffee and 2 others like I had done something wrong, I calmly took off both kids and proceeded to show and explain that I had asked for no room and received the exact opposite, the helping employees offers to fill them up and realized they had run out from that brewer, but she immediately brought one up after that was fresh and proceed to fill up my two cups, only to still leave room.  There was no apology made at any point, I was no rude to them and did not saying  anything to aggravate them either. This was a very poor experience and will not recommend this Amelie's location to anyone, spend the money on parking and go to the Uptown location where you will have a much more friendly, helpful, and honest staff of employees.",

    "text": "Back in June (or whenever the hell my second week of vacation was for the year), I went to go see my big sis in Charlotte.  When I was there, she kept telling me about this bakery I just had to try.  Nestled in the NoDa district (hipster central), we went to Amelie's, a 24 hour French bakery/hangout.  Now, my sister is fluent in French, and I used to live (and cook!) there.  When it comes to all things French, I can be pretty critical of it (kind of like the same way I am with steaks).  So, we decided to go.  She had been before, and she enjoyed it- but told me there are times when the line can be out the door.    When you pull up, it looks like it is in a strip mall of warehouses (new or old, I have no idea).  When you walk in, you are what seems to be you immersed in pop culture.  I would like to think of it as if Andy Warhol designed the place.  There is a counter with all of the pastries and desserts, and a chalked menu of everything else.  I noticed the seating is interesting, as there are no two tables alike- and it seems there are as many couches as there are seats.    My first visit, I ordered the croque monsieur and a cream soda.  Sis got some kid sized stuff- I asked her if that was all she was getting?   We sat at one of the tables near the door.  As we were waiting, I kept getting the signature dirty looks.  If anyone wanted to start some shit, I was ready!  The food then came out.  It was pretty decent, with the flavors of cheese and Dijon adding to it.  I scarfed it, and was wanting more.  But it being a French bakery and all (and the dirty looks I was getting), I decided to just have that.  When I came back in town for Thanksgiving, I brought my best friend with me.  We decided to go back.  This time, it was him, my sister, my year old nephew, and myself.  This time, I was starving, and I was not going to hold back.    I ordered a croque monsieur again, and a ham sandwich with cheese.  My buddy got some  kind of sandwich, but I don't remember.   I remember at the time, we didn't get a number (for whatever reason), and then I realized everyone else did.  We had 3 sandwiches coming, they better not lose the order!  We sat at a table in the back, with a couch and 2 chairs.  I was playing with my nephew as his face was covered in chocolate (sis got eclairs).  My sis took him outside for a few to get some air.  We were waiting a few, and then I thought I saw our food come out, and the runner you could tell was baffled, as there was no number.    She then ran another order of food, and then I got her attention- \"I think those were our sandwiches\".  The funny thing is, we never got a receipt either, so it was a matter of faith.  Our food then came out.  This time, the croque was very flaky, and not like in a buttery flaky way, but like \"god damn, I need water after every bite\" flaky.  I washed it down with the other sandwich.  Thankfully the cream soda is sold in pints!  It's cool that this place is open at all hours of the day and is pretty large, but I don't know- I can come here every so once in a while, but that gaffe was kind of a turn off.  All the cashier had to say it was for the big motherfucker in camo and a braves hat.  I can ASSURE I was the only one...  Another thing that irked me was seeing the creme brulee was already bruleed.  The topping gets compromised after sitting there for 3 hours or more, and let's be honest, they aren't making creme brulees every 3 hours...  And if they are, I sincerely apologize.  But like a great cannoli, you fill the shell when you order it.  But hey, what the hell would I know about French cuisine...",

    "text": "Our family friend introduced us to Amelie's a few years ago when she came by with a box of delectable desserts to cheer my family up while my mom was undergoing chemo for breast cancer.  That was the first time I had the salted caramel brownie.  It was perfection, not only for the taste and texture, but for the uplifting power it had during a difficult time in my life.  Since then, every subsequent trip to Charlotte involves the obligatory stop here.  It's nice to eat there and take-in the French bistro vibe, when a table is available, but we usually grab and go enjoy in the comfort of my mom's house.  There's always a line, but it's good because that gives me time to oogle the display window and decide what else to try along with the salted caramel brownie.  The macarons are HUGE - more to love and savor.  I've also bought some mini tarts to give to friends that I visit in NC or to take back with me to Chi.  The only snafu I've experienced here is being accidentally overcharged for a large order of salted caramel brownies.  The cashier misunderstood and charged me for an extra 4 brownies (he also didn't open the box to count himself).  It was partially my fault for not double checking the bill and correcting it right after.  However, that hasn't stopped me for coming back for more.  I also love the name, which is the same name as my all-time favorite movie!",

The staff was nice and very helpful and patient explaining what the items were. I ended up buying a raspberry fruit tart, pistachio macarons, and their seasonal passion fruit strawberry lemonade to drink. All were really good! The tart was sweet, but not too sugary. Just enough tartness to it! I just recently started enjoying macarons and this was so fresh. The passion fruit strawberry lemonade had stronger hints of passion fruit and sparkling fruit soda, the strawberry lemonade taste was not as strong on my order. It was really great!!! I hope I can come back before I leave tomorrow night. I hope to find something similar to this bakery back home in the Philadelphia area.",

Tip- No matter what line you order from you can order pastries, bistro and drinks, no I wasn't told that, I gathered that after stupidly ordering twice. Oh well! Live and learn I suppose! Overall, nice staff!  Food/Drinks- I will touch on the beverages as I have yet to try their pastries! I had the best Fall drink! Like Fall in a cup here guys! It was the Salted Caramel Apple Cider! Yum! Must try! I think it may be only seasonal (which I really hope not!) but go and try!  Overall, a must try place! Obviously a place that is iconic to Charlotte and for good reason :)",

I think calling the salted carmel brownie, a 'brownie' it's a bit of a misnomer. It's really more like a bar. Half delicious salted caramel and have crispy chocolate cake. Very sweet and very good.  The pistachio torte was my favorite purchase. Slightly sweetened pistachio crumbles and thin layers of vanilla cake and a rich dark chocolate layer. I wish I bought more of these to bring back to ny.  The macaron was well made and comparable to my favorite macaron spot in ny (bisous ciao).",

You order at the counter, are given a number to take to your table, and your food appears impressively fast!   The food was good. I got Turkey and Brie with a seasonal compote on a white baguette. I got the entire sandwich and a cup of beef and barely soup for just $7.59. The portion was such that I wouldn't have been full with the half sandwich and side ($6.59). The sandwich was warm and contained only the exact ingredients listed on the menu.  There was free water. Also there is a substantial dessert counter that looked amazing.   Good quick service lunch spot / bakery / cafe. Grab a table and stay awhile.",

Which are:  Table immediately inside the door so that would-be lunchers break left and right, confused, and have to spend a sec asking \"are you in line?\"   More than occasional space cadet order takers  Price inflexibility (adding things to, say, a lunch tartine can run you upwards of 2 bucks, if they let you do it at all)  But, I never leave here having spent less than $10, and my theory is that there's some sort of weird hypnosis that gorgeous case of pastries triggers. All the color and perfect chocolate swirls, perhaps... anyways, when I come to, I've got not only my coffee and sammich but also a baguette, cup of soup and tart tucked under my arm (well, in a box, anyway).  Take it from an NYC pastry hunter - prices on tarts, cream puffs, macaroons, etc. are reasonable, darlings. A perfect eclair is an extensive and laborious process.  The vegan soup is deeelish, as are their other choices (seems there's always a veg or vegan option, so yay!).  And 24hrs? Quelle bonne idee!",

I mean, I love coffee. And I love homemade dessert. So they would have quite the perma-customer. All in exchange for allowing a drifter to indulge in their cute and quirky space: striped walls, hip chandeliers, arty black & white photography.  In other words, lurved it. Enjoyed my ice latte too. But unfortunately, the coffee torte left a little something to be desired -- evidenced by the fact that I left mine only 2/3 finished. UNHEARD of when it comes to dessert.

    "text": "I met up with a couple of friends while on my somewhat annual Christmas trip to Charlotte.  My friends were late due to traffic and laundry, so I sat in Amelie's on a couch by the door for about an hour (yeah, I know) and the staff didn't even care!  THIS IS A GOOD THING. I didn't get any dirty looks for not buying anything, nor did I get asked if I wanted anything.  They just let me sit there and wait.  And people watch.    The vibe of Amelie's is really laid back... One of my friends (can't remember who, sorry!) said that it was like a \"little piece of Boone in Charlotte.\"  I wouldn't really say all that, but I definitely appreciated the mix of clientele from people getting off of work from their corporate jobs to hipsters coming to hang out, to young parents coming to pick up snacks, to whoever else happened to walk in to get anything ranging from coffee to a loaf of French bread.  I stayed for quite a while with my friends (again, not a problem with the staff at all) and was good with it all until about 10 pm, where the crowd seemed to gravitate more towards groups kids (I can say kids, right?) who are excited to not be at home with their parents and people dressed up for the skanky Charlotte bar scene.  That's when my friend and I finally took our queue to leave...  ...But not before having a cup of awesome coffee, a croque monsieur, a fruit tie, a salted caramel brownie, a cup of earl gray, and a croissant... I told you, I was there for a while... Probably like 5 or 6 hours.  The food was all delicious.  The croque monsieur had a little more mustard than I would've liked, but I'm not a fan of mustard... The salted caramel brownie was AMAZING.  It was perfectly sized and had equal parts salted caramel and fudgy brownie.  The croissant just tempted my from the display case, so I HAD to eat it... The fruit tie?  While ginormous, I prefer the kolochies (totally butchered that word, but hey, I'm not Polish) made by the locals in Chicago.   Final verdict:  I'll be bringing Joe the next time we go to NC and the food is kinda pricey I guess and nothing out of this world (except that brownie), but the atmosphere is totally worth it.",

I was surprised at how it was open 24 hours and also the line and overall size of the place! It was huge inside and many people were just hanging out even at 10 at night. People were eating, doing work and just lounging throughout the entire place.   The line moved quickly and I ended up with a salted Carmel brownie, which was very tasty. The only thing that was just a tad bit disappointing is that there wasn't much selection when I was there. It seemed that they were in the midst of changing out their display.   I appreciated when the cashier also told us about the free water cups instead of immediately charging us for a bottle of water. Overall, the brownie was very good and the small raspberry cup was delicious as well. The prices were reasonable and the entire dining area/lounge rooms were very clean.",

The food offerings are slight and not meal-level, the pastries (that I've had) are unimpressive, the coffee is mediocre, the layout is spastic, the furnishings are uncomfortable, it is not particularly good for pleasant conversation or getting work done.   It is, however, open 24 hours everyday and that makes it a great destination after 11:00pm when all the other cafes in town have closed.    The service is good and the people working there are very friendly -- just as I would expect for such a friendly city.  It has great potential if they can upscale the tables and chairs to more practical and comfortable pieces, improve the lighting, decrease the background noises, and make the layout more attractive, functional, and cohesive.",

    "text": "I ordered a cake for my dad's birthday from this establishment. I was so excited about it because since moving to Charlotte everyone has ranted and raved about this place. It was far from satisfying. I ordered their strawberry vanilla type cake. It had some fancy name and the ingredients also sounded super fancy so I ordered it. I ordered it to serve 6 people. They suggested getting one that severed up to 10 people so I did. It costed about $35 and I ordered it to be picked up on a Friday. On Wednesday I called to see if I could get it a day early and they said that most likely wasn't possible but they would try and call me if they could. I never got a call that's fine I ordered it for Friday so that was my doing. Well when I picked it up it looked amazing. Beautiful and delicious. Well not the case. Once we sang happy birthday and my dad blew out the candles we cut into it. The icing fell off as if it had been frozen for a few days on there. The cake was  dry so dry as in my mom has to mix in vanilla ice cream that we had to make it less dry. I was so disappointed. I was thinking of calling and complaining but I didn't because I don't like to complain. But I felt the need to write a review. Maybe they made the cake early and left it in the freezer or maybe their cakes are dry and flavorless. I don't know but I won't be going back.",

    "text": "This has to be the best kept little secret in Charlotte! I only recently visited Amelies for the very first time. My daughter is a hair stylist in NoDa and asked if I'd go with her to grab some french pastries on her lunch break. I was so delighted by the atmosphere with chandeliers and colorful decor. They have plenty of parking and many delicious pastries, sandwiches, soups, quiches and salads to offer! I was in a hurry so I didn't have time to see the whole menu however I believe they also offer a great selection of coffee and beverages. My fruit tart was amazing! The only complaint I have is that it was very busy and the line was really long so it took awhile just to order food, then had to wait for it to be prepared and brought out to us. We spent 30 minutes in total, and was only expecting a quick 10-15 minute stop to grab some take out. If you are in a rush, be sure to allow a little more time to get thru the line, and I'm sure they are always very busy at the lunch hour, which is when I went. Will definitely go again and next time I'll plan to stay a bit longer and also try a hot coffee latte.",

The place is huge..it has several cozy rooms and has seating galore.  The building shares an indoor patio with adjoining businesses for bigger groups.  The decor itself is awesomely quirky.  Check out the chandelier made of eating utensils when you enter the front door.  Classic furniture and French memorabilia on the walls.  So you never fight for a seat.  Free Wi-Fi and books all over the place, as well.  The coffee is most excellent, even decaf.  That's rare when even the decaf tastes good.  I love chocolate croissants and Amelie's makes a crispy one at  that. Plus, the tarts are tres bon!  You can order a French press and they will bring you a small press for two.  Nice date idea, fellas.  The desserts are smallish (I'm American, I know) and the prices are somewhat steep for these goods.  Still, its an experience. Go for the coffee and fellowship and indulge yourself in the sweets once in a while.  Nice place to meet trendy folks in Charlotte.",

The only nit pick I have is that to get your one free refill of coffee at their Carmel place you need to get back in line for someone behind the counter to refill your cup. Small price to pay for some of the best pastries and bread in Charlotte. Their coffee is also excellent. Great place for a breakfast sandwich or a light lunch sandwich (great pate) or soup.",

And they're open 24 hours, what more could a college student ask for?  Good coffee, which they have.  And the decor is quite eclectic.  I just love the furniture and the ambiance of the place.  It has a very artsy feel to it, which is quite comforting to me.  The only down side to this place is the price of items.  Yes, everything is very delicious, but you pay for the quality of the items.  I bought a cup of soup there, which came with a small slice of baguette, a brownie and a coffee.  This came to just over $8.  It was good, but a little steep.",

The line does tend to move at a pretty steady rate, but if you're impatient it's better to check out the local Harris Teeter. I've only been twice, so please do read with a grain of salt. I've only had macaroons twice, both times here as a new experience, and both times they were pretty good from what I could tell (although I'm not much of a food critic) and the small mousse cups are a delicious little bite. I would like to see more variety when it comes to macaroons though, I've seen so many flavors online. My biggest complaint would have to be the staff; they all seem a bit unpleasant. The cashiers seem to be less than enthusiastic to be ringing customers up. At my last visit a woman behind the counter was helping those waiting in line to get their boxes prepared for the register, and after serving us in a mundane manner she quietly asked the folks behind us for their order. Being that it was so busy and it was a small group of friends chatting they more than likely didn't here her, but she mumbled something under her breath and turned away from them. I don't know what she said, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't very kind... I get it, it must be exhausting, but you have to be aware of the fact that you are working an exhausting job, at least TRY to act like you're happy to take $13 for a few pastries.",

    "text": "From reading other reviews (and my sister's personal experience), I was worried the line would be extremely long but we waited only about 15 minutes on a Friday night around 8:45pm.   We ordered LOTS of desserts - chocolate eclair ($3.49), cream puff ($2.09), mixed berry 4\" tart ($4.89), lemon raspberry fruit tart ($4.89), mini chocolate ganache cake (?), salted caramel brownies ($2.29), coconut macaroons ($1.59), pistachio flavored petit-four ($2.09), espresso mini mousse cups ($1.59), and every flavor of french macarons they had available ($2.29)..   They had many workers restocking, but only 1 person taking orders and 1 person working the cash register. Is this to regulate the flow of the line? It must slow down the line because the person taking the order has to tell the cashier everything in the order, and if the cashier doesn't hear everything, then it's just chaos.  Any way, I personally didn't try everything we ordered so I can only give my sweet-tooth loving opinion on some of the items..but the chocolate ganache cake is highly recommendable. Not too rich and I loved the filling. It can be split between two people. The espresso mini mousse cup was not as great as it sounds. Bite-size and not as fluffy as I wanted. The salted caramel brownie is, if not the best (read in many other reviews), one of the most popular items.. but I thought the caramel was way too much. It is what contains the salt of course and the brownie would just be a normal chocolate brownie without it.. because the brownie alone did not taste like any chocolate worth remembering. Lastly, the cream puff is filled with custard which is something I love, but it isn't worth $2. I mean, it's huge, so if you really love cream puffs, have at it. Order it alone or split it with someone and order one other item.",

The concept of a French bakery in Charlotte makes me swoon. Heck, the concept of any kind of bakery not inside a grocery store is a great. I have a long-standing affair with Parisian pastries and flaky breads. Caramel salted brownies? You guys go ahead...I'm going to hang around.  The atmosphere is kitschy in a way that works. Incredibly odd light fixtures. Doorways in random places, a framed mirror that wraps around the corner, and a menagerie of random chairs and tables, like a home show for the Island of Misfit Toys.  And, open 24 hours. In Charlotte. No further details needed.  But, it is crowded. Very, crowded. With so few other options for the people still awake at 3am, the lines are always long. It's rare to find a table in the cafe-proper (better luck in the atrium common area behind their spot). And, (this is me being picky), there usually seem to be a few too many high schoolers who are just so cool and trendy it hurts (no, it really does hurt...my eyes can't take that much skinny jeans and awful plaid...but I digress). In my opinion, they are a bit pricey, too. Yes, they make great food. But $1.50 or $2 for something that is barely one bite?   Amelie, I think we will have to continue our love-hate courtship. Let's just not assign a label and see where it goes.",

Maybe because we came late at night? I'm not sure the reason why but the lines were long and I didn't mind because the atmosphere and decor there was absolutely one of a kind. I wished I could've said the same with their bakery... I would update this bad review when or if I would ever go back.",

The desserts have also been off their game. I've notice this gradual change for a while but tonight has pushed me to right a review cause of the service of the male cashier. 1st and last impression are the most important. If there's no quiche than say \"oh sorry but we don't have any tonight\" not \"we don't have quiche\". Its takes just a lil bit of effort but can make the biggest difference. Don't be stingy w words. If I'm bothering as a customer than maybe this isn't the right job for you. Love the place, just pick better employees",

    "text": "This place comes highly recommended from everyone I asked when I visited Charlotte. I have to say that the hype was a real letdown when I got there.  It seems that this place sees a lot of business, as evidenced by the line to be served, and the full seating area (which is ample, to be fair). I tried a croissant and a danish. The croissant was dense and did not appear to take to the filling very well.  It looked deflated and sad.  It tasted wonderful, though, save for the dense chewy texture. I had to check the menu on the way out to confirm that it wasn't one of the twice-baked croissants. The danish was good!  I ordered a cafe au lait, which is my standard go-to beverage when I'm not feeling like I need a full-powered drink. Granted, this place is not a specialized coffeehouse, but it does offer lattes and the like.  My drink came barely hot with about two inches of foam. The coffee flavor was nothing special. If it were my first of the morning,   It was okay, but I will probably go somewhere else for coffee. I would like to return to try a cake sometime on a future visit to Charlotte.  This review is mainly for my experience there, which didn't include sampling a lot of the French pastries which were available. I may want to revise my review once I try more.",

    "text": "Amelies is one of my favorite places to go in the Charlotte area. It is different, always open, and I love to go just to try something new. My only concern is that it could be cleaner. Almost every time I have ever been to Amelies the tables haven't been cleaned. My only suggestion would be to have someone constantly sweeping and wiping down tables or just checking the atrium/inside for dirty floors and tables. Honestly who wants to eat somewhere that doesn't feel clean? I also wonder about how long some of the treats are sitting in the display.  I went yesterday and ordered a croissant from the display and it was dry and hard. I also tried four different macaroons but all except for one tasted like it had been sitting for a while so it had a weird and stale after taste.  Great idea in this place but needs way more of a managerial touch.",

Croissant sandwiches, salads & other morsels are a delight.  Now I have to mention all the tender, luscious sweets they have on hand. What do you want? Cake, macarons, or perhaps a freshly made tart. YOU WILL DIE OF A SWEET ATTACK! Whoever is back there in that pastry kitchen is trying to murder us with sugar, I'm sure of it! The creative flavors of the macarons will tantalize the palate.

It's very easy to walk out of there having spent 50 dollars on pastries. With that said, said pasteries not bad at all so the overall experience renders it 3 stars.",

It was hard like a rock, not like a sticky bun ought to be.  I had to ask for another one, and the lady realized all the other buns were hard too, so she had to take it back to microwave it to soften it.  Didn't help too much.  The chocolate croissant tasted like chocolate bread.  NOT a croissant.  Bread.  The apple turnover was decent - it had some crispy texture to it with an ok filling.  McDonald's makes better apple pies.  The twice baked croissant with almonds was pretty good - probably the best thing I tried that morning.    Salted caramel brownie was very dense.  It had good flavor, but there's no way I could eat an entire thing, or even half of one, in one sitting.  Maybe I just don't get the salted caramel craze.  At least the coffee was pretty good.  And you get a free refill.  A little bit of redemption there.  I'm just not sure why this place has such great ratings.  Some may say decor, environment, convenience of it being 24 hours, etc.  But if the food is no good, why should any of that other stuff matter?  Just go to Waffle House.  It's cheaper there.",

The salted caramel brownie was fantastic, and definitely something I would order again if I lived in the area. Loved the decor inside the NoDa location too. Super kitchy and very cozy- would be a perfect place to spend a Saturday afternoon with a good book. I wasn't super impressed with the buttercream that adorned the strawberry mini cake I ordered, but that might just be my personal taste- I prefer a buttercream that is slightly sweeter rather than buttery.",

    "text": "Amelie's is always a must when I have guests visiting from out of town. I have not figured out when the best time to go is though as the lines really seem to vary.   Although the desserts stand out because they are so pretty to look at and there are so many to choose from, I'm never quite satisfied. The best options I think are the salted caramel brownie or the fruit tarts. The seasonal cakes and gateauxs tend to be dry and the macarons are fair at best. The hidden star of the menu is the quiche of the day. I'm never disappointed by it and the texture of the crust is perfect. The other thing that is a hit would be their beverages. The seasonal lemonades for those avoiding caffeine or the cafe marcottier for those needing a buzz would be my go-to choices.",

I usually grab a tart while in WholeFood and I've always thought they were perfect in flavor. Welllll I was WRONG and I'm NEVER WRONG ;-) I had a tart which by the way was super TINY and quite pricey that had soooo much FLAVOR it was crazy. It was just a bite and when I say bite I mean bite (see photo). I don't give many 5 star reviews as it take a lot to impress me as a place has to be great from start to finish and Amelia's didn't disappoint as the staff was kind, welcoming and generous. I also grabbed a crescent and a roll of bread to go. Each were extremely fresh and awesome when consumed the next day. The fact that this place is 24 hours is a TRUE SCORE as I'll be back REALLY SOON Ya Hear",

I tried the turkey and brie and it was absolutely delicious. For dessert, I indulged in an apple pie which was the perfect ending to a great meal!

Very hard to find parking and when I did find parking, customers had their cars overlapped into the adjacent spot. So yeah, it aggravated me just a little.   Inside the Cafe: First impression? Wow. This is a small place. It was genuinely busy. The line stretched all the way to the backroom. My friends and I waited about 10 minutes just to get to see the actual sweets and food.   Menu: It's a cute menu. Hard to read when you're all the way in the back.   Food: Expensive. Almost $2 per macaron & not a very wide selection of macarons either. I bought some sort of chocolate cake while my friends decided to get the macarons. My cake was $6-ish. It was very sweet. I didn't finish it because it was just too sweet for me to finish. The macarons that my friends bought were slightly stale. They weren't too impressed with the visit either.  It might have been just that night. I'll try again when I'm in the area.",

The selection is ever rotating, fresh, and never cloyingly sweet the way most bakeries here in the south are.   I love that I can come in with my laptop (sometimes for hours), grab some tasty pastries, and a dirty chai  and just get work done no questions asked. The service is always friendly and they are accommodating to my crazily specific requests for my lattes.   A bit pricey at times, but you get what you pay for and personally I have no problem paying a bit more for artisanal pastries/drinks and the ambiance.   I haven't been to the Uptown location, but I will drive out of the way to go to the NoDa location over the Carmel Rd. location, it just has a different feel and slightly different clientele.",

They have a delicious assortment of bakery treats to choose from, and nothing I tasted disappointed me at all. I even took some macarons and tarts to take home for my family.  They also have really great coffees and teas. I wished I could have tasted them all.  Out of all the reasons to live in Charlotte, Amelie's would have been my primary reason to move there.",

The coffee was pretty tasty, and I'm not a dessert eater but the Napoleon looked too decadent to pass up. It was huge, probably 5-6\" long, flaky fresh and stuffed with delicious pastry cream. I couldn't finish half of it. Heaven!  The star of the show is really the whimsical interior, with a mismatched Alice in Wonderland meets the Mad Hatter meets the Queen of Hearts and Mona Lisa at the pseudo-Versailles kind of vibe. It's bigger than it appears from the outside.  Really for adults of all ages, but it's quiet, cozy, eclectic... full of collegiate and twenty-something hipsters on their laptops and iPads. I guess I fit right in!  ?!? =p",

I usually stop by after a night of partying in Noda and get their famous salted caramel brownie, or a macaroon or two. They are always open and seem to be at their busiest during the nights on weekends where the line wraps around the corner and heads towards the back of the building. The line does seem to move fairly quickly where you are rewarded with your choice of amazing pastries from the case. The coffee is also very good as they use Pure Intentions coffee who has made a custom blend of coffee and espresso just for them. They recently added a couple flavors of macaroon ice cream sandwiches, I had the salted caramel version and it was super good, I would definitely recommend trying this if they have them available.",

    "text": "Amelie's in NoDa is \"The O.G.\" or as I like to put it, 'My 3rd Shift Savior' (back in the day, when I rolled at night). Where else are you going to go to get a chocolate croissant at 2:30 in the morning? Wait, why do you want a croissant at that hour? None of my business, it's yours if you're in NoDa!  Located at the corner of 28th and N. Davidson, Amelie's is everything you've ever wanted in a corner side cafe. They make premium coffee, tea, and desserts as well as many lunch offerings. My hands down favorite for lunch is the Chicken Salad croissant: chunky texture, very little filler (just for binding), buttery flaky pastry, excuse me for a moment I need to take a drive back there now!  How about sweets? Mixed berry Macaron is a crowd-pleaser. Be sure to ask the counter staff about all of the macarons on display. The Salted Caramel Layered Torte is great, as long as I didn't have something too filling to eat before because this thing is as rich as it comes. If you're familiar with the Salted Caramel Brownie, add laters of mousse in between with more chocolate. WOW  Mad respect where it is due, with this being the original location, but I'm a much more frequent patron of the uptown location. Not due to proximity, because I'm much, much closer to the NoDa site, but because of the typical crowdedness of the place. Forget about sitting anywhere near the service counter unless you want to be brushed up against by dozens of people you don't know! Even the back is iffy sometimes if they're really busy as the line can easily back up 50-60 deep. They're doing the best they can, trust me, it's just a really busy spot. Don't even think about going here after a N. Charlotte event or a NBA game, you're doomed. When it comes to crowd control, they're a victim of their tremendous success.  Yes, logic would have you believe that the Uptown location would be busier, but it's almost always the exact opposite. Still, sometimes I'll pick a time I know it won't be too bad (think very, very early on a weekday, like 5am) just to enjoy the ambiance this location offers, knowing that I'm sitting in the middle of Charlotte history, and wondering where they'll pop up next (please be University, Mallard Creek even better!).  To all the people who thought a 24/7 bakery in the middle of NoDa would close down within 3 months, look at them now. Break bread with your neighbors and join in the pride of watching this great QC brand continue to grow and wow you with enticing treats!",

There always seems to be a disconnect from the point of the order taken to being delivered. More often than not we have to have our order remade or we just suck it up and chalk it up to a loss. Today we simply ordered a couple double espressos, as she flings them down, half of one spills all over the coaster. She looks down at it, says nothing and casually walks away. Last time, I ordered a cappuccino, specifically asked to make sure it's in a glass cup so it stays hot. They place it in a paper cup, I call them out on it. Their response is that we're out of glass cups. So tell me! I'd get an iced coffee instead.",

I ordered a couple of items, including the bread pudding which i was told takes 13 minutes, which i get every time so that was no issue. I also ordered a key lime pie which was perfect! Also a chocolate croissant ,which i usually Love, was a lot less chocolate than usual and in my opinion was toasted too long.  We started eating the pie and croissant as we waited for the bread pudding. 20 minutes go by and nothing. My husband went to the counter and asked about it and was told that it is on its way. 25 more minutes go by and finally it arrived. I don't know if they forgot about it or what but 45 minutes for a little thing of bread pudding was ridiculous! Luckily it was delicious but not worth the wait!",

    "text": "I was very excited when I heard about Amelie's-hoping Charlotte finally got a good, European-style bakery.  So I went there a few days ago for lunch with a friend. Was mesmerized by the display case of tarts, eclairs, croissants, pains au chocolate, and a few cakes. The employee at the counter told us they also had lunch available, so we decided to stay for lunch. The sandwiches-a roast beef sandwich and a Croque-monsieur-were good. The CM actually was awesome. But 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas cost around $17, if I remember correctly.  We got some sweets to go-one large Napoleon and a chocolate croissant. I I should have known by the dark brown color of the pastry that the Napoleon was over baked, but I went ahead and got it. And tasting it I knew that the pastry was definitely way overcooked and the filling could not overcome that over-baked flavor. I suspect the baker must have been Prussian and didn't care for the namesake of this dessert,  because everything else in the case looked good.  The pain au chocolate (which I saved for breakfast the next morning) was good too.  I honestly am more of a cake person, so I may go back to try one or two of the cake-y items they have, and the tarts look good too.  I left with an overall good impression (any 24-hour bakery gets high marks in my book). The prices also seemed a bit high, but perhaps I am just used to my local latino bakery, where everything seems ridiculously cheap. Definitely a good place to get something different, and I will definitely go back.",

I typically want a greasy burger after a 2am bar night but this place wold give a greasy burger a run for my money. we went all out and spend $70 on creamy goodness.

    "text": "This place did not live up to the hype.  Amelie's is overpriced and food is so-so.  The croissant was cold, the soup was extremely pricey, and the sandwich had zero taste.  The only thing I didn't try was something from the dessert menu.  I tried to get something, but they said they ran out.  Now I'm not an expert baker or anything, but seeing how this is a bakery, why couldn't they just BAKE another dessert for me.  The atmosphere was nice, but compares nothing to going to a real BAKERY in a place like NYC.  And having free WIFI is great, but Panera Bread has that too, and at that, so does my house.  2 stars for this place.",

Arrived around 10:15 on Saturday morning only to learn that...gasp...they had no almond croissants.  MAJOR bummer.  Decided to try an apple turnover, which was pretty mediocre, and got a cheese danish and chocolate & almond croissant to share the next morning.  The cheese danish was decent, not great, and the croissant was excellent.  If we had only ordered the chocolate & almond croissant, I would most likely be giving a 4-star rating.  Maybe there are other \"wow\" items that we just didn't select...not sure...or maybe we're spoiled having been to Paris & other excellent French bakeries in the States.",

They are pretty good, but I didn't quite do my \"Happy Food Dance\" from anything that I tried.

It has an old-school East Village flair with bohemian decor and fabulous pastries.  The line is out the door most times I go, and I always plan on waiting for at least 10 minutes before I can place my order.  They even have some gluten free options!  Coffee is good, and service is pretty fast considering there's always a ton of people there.  When I am in the 'hood, we always stop for some pastries.

OMG. they are delicious.. a little bit pricey but if you want the real thing then this place is where you'll find almost any thing that you can imagine or something you have not had in 20 years,.. yep.. it's here.. I gave them a 5 because they deserve it. i cant think of any other place even close to where i live that has the variety of baked goodies. my sister goes there weekly and brings over a lot of great things from this place.. I am so glad that they are in Charlotte and especially that they are open 24/7..i dont understand that especially being on that side of Charlotte but hey its good to know that they're in town. i only wish there was a  Amelie's French Bakery in the Gaston county area. I am from Mount Holly and i would buy much more from them if there were a little closer to my home..As far as what i have eaten there its definitely a 5 star..Please open up another bakery in Gaston county someday..  i really hope you would do that. you would rock this town and there would be no competition that could come close to what you guys serve. i mean it. there are a few wanna be bakeries in Gastonia but their pastries are made early in the morning and by 5 0r 6 PM its old and not Fresh. Stale  in other words. I would say their name but i would not want to  embarrass them or humiliate the company..  they are so-so but not the real thing like you have.. and lastly..your food is always FRESH...Thanks for being part of Charlotte and NoDa....",

The chocolate truffles filled with different flavors of ganache are a must-try. The passionfruit is indescribably sweet, tart, and chocolate-y all at once. It is positively orgasmic. In addition to passionfruit, there is currant, raspberry, and chocolate ganache. All are a chocolate-lovers dream.  Their pastries are light, delicate, and fresh, and coffee is abundant. Other Yelpers have described Amelie's atmosphere- it certainly is a cheerful spot on the otherwise depressed edge of NoDa. No help, either, that there seems to be permanent road and construction work all around.  Never mind all that, when you visit Amelie's you have the sense you're in a Parisian patisserie, where the plaintive voice of Edith Piaf wraps you in a fur coat of luxury.

My husband and I ordered 5 different pastries for us and our children and 2 sandwiches.  We waited a while for our sandwhiches...no big deal. Then we see a man take our sandwiches to the wrong person and get upset. I tried to tell him they were ours but he brushed passed me ignoring me. It was obvious he was upset. He threw our food down behind the counter and started angrily throwing them into to go boxes. I had a side salad and he slammed it around until half the salad fell out of the bowl. Another lady had to remake the salad.  My husband yelled at him to stop being so rough with our food but he ignored my husband. He tried to give our food away again to the same guy but then calmed down enough to hear it was ours. He was like \"I'm sorry man\".  I was so disappointed in the entire experience.  I also drive for Uber and recommend Amelies to numerous out of town guests. I probably won't anymore if they risk being treated that way. No matter how successful a business is, they should always treat their customers with more respect.",

The ambience is super cool as well; just loads of interesting decor, paints, sideways chandeliers... it's lots of fun to look at!   The only thing keeping me from giving a perfect 5: from what I've noticed it seems like a majority of the seating is taken up by \"study-ers.\" You know those people that take up an entire table for themselves and have their books and laptops laying everywhere while they've been babysitting whatever the cheapest item is on the menu?! Yeah those people hang out here too. JUST GO TO A LIBRARY!!! So good luck scrounging for seating! If it's a nice day/night, there's usually a few seats outside. We mostly end up eating in our car or take it to go.  I'm not claiming to have ever visited Paris but if I had to dream of what Parisian pastries/sweets taste like, this is it. Matter of fact, I'll probably be disappointed if one day I go to Paris and things don't taste like what Amelie's serves haha. Okay, that comes across a bit ignorant but, you get the picture. Come here, enjoy the sweets and leave happy!",

    "text": "I absolutely adore Amelie's. The thing that sticks out to me most when I think about this place is quality. They truly put their passion behind their products to make the highest quality french pastries, cookies, pies and other confections. My favorite thing to do is to pop in and just buy one tiny treat for myself when I've hit a big goal or really need a little pick-me-up. Because the desserts are so well made, I know that every calorie is worth it.   They also have coffee and tea and delicious made to order sandwiches and salads. As with the baked goods, these are also crafted with care with high quality ingredients.   I have to stop writing this review now because just thinking about this place is making my mouth water and I don't want to drool all over my keyboard. So, don't take my word for it, go try Amelie's out for yourself!",

I know Amelie's is very popular here in the Queen City so I decided to go here one night after a romantic dinner date at a very nice Italian restaurant.   Upon walking in to Amelie's, I felt like a stepped back in time and was transported to France. Gorgeous decor and I really love the style of the place. It made me feel like I was inside a little dollhouse. The food did not impress me like the decorations did. I got a slice of chocolate peanut butter cake and it was SO DRY I couldn't even finish it. Absolutely disgusting. I took 3 bites and tossed the rest in the trash. I also got 2 macarons and those were alright. It didn't taste as good as macarons I've gotten from other places.   I was very disappointed with the food here and I can't believe this place is so popular in Charlotte. I'm gonna stick to Renaissance Patisserie whenever I want to go to a French cafe.",

I've pretty much been to all of their locations, with the NoDA bakery being my favorite as it's less crowded and parking is easy and available. The service is always friendly and fast considering lines can get long. Their desserts are incredible! From the mini tarts, to the macaroons, to their pecan pies, and eclairs!   But today I tried possibly the best dessert yet! The Lavender Lemon Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwich filled with a lemon sorbet! HOLY SH#T!!!    I'm definitely a fan!",

I do not like crowds and this place is really crowded with people pushing past and knocking your table. We were here at around 5:00 pm on a Saturday, so I am thinking this is probably a typical crowd. For me the desserts and coffee would be a 4.5, but the crowds and the noise bring it down to a 3. Great pastries and coffee, but not great enough to deal with the crowds. Not sure what Amelie's can do about it. It was on a few lists of where to go in Charlotte, so we stopped by. Don't regret coming, but unless I lived in Charlotte, I would not bother to return.",

I rarely travel for business but I did this time, and it was such a nice break to spend some time away, with 3 nights free to explore and do what I wanted. I found Amelie's through my trusty Yelp app and gave it a try since it was so close to the Vietnamese place I wanted to try.   The place is huge, on the end of a strip mall, but once you enter you can see how it's such an eclectic, very Euro-country-chic but laid back. A little pricey, but who cares when you are sampling delectable French pastries. I ordered a mocha and salted caramel brown to treat myself that evening, and took home Macaroons for my boys. The flavors ranged from the standard vanilla, strawberry to the elevated and chic: I believe there was a rose flavor and possibly another unique herb-based flavor.  My treat was delicious, my boys LOVED their macaroons, and I wished I had time to stay longer because it was just so comfortable in there. I would go back any time.",

I went simple and ordered a Sausage, Egg, Swiss & Egg Croissant. It was extremely fresh filled me right up. Although the line is long, it moves pretty quick and they bring you your food within minutes.   The decor is unique. Nothing matches, yet looks so well together. Plenty of seating and space to study, bring a friend or a group and munch out. Deff a favorite of mine in Charlotte and I will be returning again!",

I drink a lot of coffee and I felt like ordering 4 of the tiny cups and dumping them into a large mug. Size aside, the coffee was magical. Now, baked goods. I had two tarts while I was there and they were both fantastic. The macaroons were incredible. They had multiple flavors including a balsamic berry that was just this side of transcendent.  And the sandwiches. I had a Croque Monsiour which was tasty, (I really wish they had the Croque Madame, because eggs make everything better.), the Croissant Pour Deux (small croissants layered with fig preserves, prosciutto and goat cheese), and the Seeded Roast Beef. All of their food was fantastic. We chose to keep going there rather than the expensive Brazilian Steak House down the street because their food was so spot on.

They offer a great selection of sweets, salads, sandwiches, and cold and hot drinks. Their coffees and latte's are very tasty. I had the pumpkin clove latte, and I really enjoyed it. This is my go to place if I need to get out of the house to focus on work. Open 24/7, FREE WIFI, and seating in multiple areas. My life saver    Also, the decor is so unique.. Whoever decorated their locations is very talented.",

The only smiling person!. I was there for the first time with my nieces trying to give them a unique experience and  it wasn't as expected. I walked in asked a simple question about which was the  beverage , the pastry line .. only because someone behind the counter called out \" can I help anyone with pastries \" I thought maybe there were two lines so I asked politely which one was for pastries. I didn't cut the line or assumed where it started . I asked !!  person behind the counter said  \"if you want pastries you have to stand in line\" .. well duh !! I knew that and it wasn't the question.   The person that helped us wasn't even friendly to my nieces 6, and 7 years of age.. no smile , no warmness  nothing. Folks looked at us like we had five heads or like we didn't belong or something. I was very disappointed in the way we were treated. We were rushed and pushed along like sheep. It wasn't super packed although we couldn't sit inside.  I had to sit outside wind blowing everything everywhere and all.  I didn't get any service that people on yelp raved about not even my sweet innocent nieces. The pastries were ok and way over priced. I wont be going back mainly due to the very poor service we received. I wont be recommending it to friends or co workers because if your spending your hard earned money in a business the least they can do is fake a smile.  I was surprised at the attitude and lack of service.",

Throughout college, I spent most of my time in the back atrium, utilizing their free wi-fi and working on various projects. Yes, I was a moocher! The best part is that the staff will serve you both inside the bakery and in the atrium!  The first thing you see when you come in is their vast selection of DESSERTS!!! I tell myself that I will try something new every time I come here, but I always revert to the Napoleon or Salted Caramel Brownie. They're just oh so yummyyy! The food is just as delicious. I recommend trying one of their soups of the day. None of them have failed me.",

Chai is mediocre, I always run to Smelly Cat or Central Coffee for that, and I struck off one star after I got bad service from a server on Christmas eve.

I treat myself to something savory and something sweet every time I visit Amelie's. And I usually include a lavender lemonade or a French soda.   My absolute favorite item...and I'm telling you...is practically an oral orgasm...is the strawberry pistachio twice baked croissant. I've never enjoyed a pastry like that one. You can't leave without a salted caramel brownie...and although they appear small, they pack HUGE flavor.   If you're not so much of a sweet eater, grab a roast beef sandwich. Delish. Or spend like $3 and get a baguette with a dip of choice.   The line will freak you out...but it moves quick and the service is always friendly. But...be prepared to spend more than you thought you would...and make sure to take something home for later!",

Tables were not being cleaned and my party of 4 had difficulty finding a place to sit after standing in line for far too long. I have eaten at the original location in Noda several times. I think the menu offers different dishes than the usual lunch spots. The bakery alone could make me a loyal customer. The small intimate seating works for Noda location but I don't think t's working for Carmel Road lication. There are far too many customers in this larger facility to do things the same way as Noda.",

My only complaint is the people. I'm a pretty antisocial person and not a hipster so everyone in the \"always-longest-line-ever\" line really bugs me.

The dark roast french press was exactly what I needed right before a 3hr night class downtown.  We had a family friend give us a box of Amelie's treats (filled with macaroons and salted caramel brownies).  Talk about sugar overload!  Butt the treats are all worth the sugar crash later.

With its laid back ambience, Amelie's is one of my favorite remote work locations of all time. OK. It doesn't beat a laptop at the beach but it's also not 4 hours from my house!  Only downsides of a work from Amelie's day are the slow wireless connection once the joint gets jumping and the $40 or so I drop on food while I'm there. You know how it is... French press and cinnamon raisin bun in the morning, roast beef sandwich and some asparagus leek soup for lunch, bunch of par-baked baguettes and tarts to take home...

Tried the passionfruit cake, opera torte, apple/apricot turnover, peppermint creme brulee, salted caramel macaron, and chocolate eclair. Everything here was amazing but the stand outs were the passionfruit cake and peppermint creme brulee. The passionfruit cake was so light- not overly sweet- and the frosting is probably the creamiest I've ever had. The peppermint creme brulee had just amount of peppermint, not overpowering at all. Plus, they heat the surface to order.  I was told the chicken salad sandwich was a must have and it lived up to the hype. The house dijon is so flavorful and they give you a very generous amount of chicken.  Love this place! Will be back the next time I'm in Charlotte.",

I have the best story about Alon's in Atlanta but that can wait for another day.  I drove this morning from Raleigh to Atlanta and realized quickly that Charlotte could be the location for a late breakfast.  Then I realized there was a French Bakery in Charlotte that was on one of Google's experimental sites that I visited this past weekend.  It was a 24 hour bakery that had a 360 degree camera going in the kitchen so you could watch the food being prepared any time you click the link.  The site is: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chromeweblab.com%2Fen-GB%2Fteleporter&s=288c62ccd70af082617eed5918fe38a7183756ae7a785b5dc96267c5e50dd815\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">chromeweblab.com/en-GB/t...</a> .    I got there at 10-ish and starved.  Instead of a getting a great pastry (and I have zero doubt that they make an astounding eclair, I got the breakfast sandwich with sausage and egg.  The croissant was amazing but the \"other stuff\" was just too overwhelming.  Like I said, I can't blame anyone but myself.  If I wanted breakfast, I should have stopped at an \"Awful Waffle\"  The deco is great.  It was full but not packed (10 am on Wed:) ).  The service was punctual, but not overly friendly.  No snide remarks about the French, please.  I am going to give this place another shot, for sure.",

The palmiers are buttery and flaky with the right amount of sweetness. The macarons are also good. They have the right crunch and chewiness, the \"feet\" of the macarons are beautiful. For the fillings, there are a lot of jellies and one had a really soft frosting that was almost like whipped cream, not a lot of the traditional thicker cremes. For years I was spoiled living and working down the street from a 'Lette macaron boutique so I'm picky with macarons. I haven't been able to find decent macarons in Charlotte, so it's nice to know I can go to Amelie's. I had the coconut-passion fruit cake and it was ok. The frosting was too buttery for my liking and didn't have much flavor. That being said, it's just one item out of so many other delicious items. The space is charming and the staff is kind.

    "text": "I just realized that I have not reviewed Amelie's - one of my favorite-est bakeries around.  Let me just tell you about my love affair with this French bakery.   1) They have salted caramel brownies. Yup, you read it correctly. Absolutely delectable salty/sweet/chocolately goodness. It will certainly give you a toothache and you'll appreciate it.  2) This place is open 24 hours. Holla!   3) The croissants. Oh momma likes. My personal fave is the strawberry cream cheese, but the chocolate will do in a pinch, too.  4) Great coffee. The kind of coffee that you enjoy outside the states,. No Folgers, here, friends.  5) Free WiFi! Woot!  6) The all around lovely atmosphere. Amelie's is just a cozy, breath of fresh air for me. The perfect spot to park with a laptop or stuff my face with umpteen pastries.  On a side note, I haven't tried Amelie's lunchy food yet, but I'm looking forward to it.   Amelie's makes me (almost) love the French - it's THAT good.",

We thought the caramel brownie was the best by far! Must have. We also got some tarts, eclair and cream puff. They were ok. Cream puff had custard which normally its a white cream so was disappointed. They were also out of most of the macaroons so we didn't get to try them. We did get some breakfast things like chocolate croissant, honey bun and cinnamon stick. The honey bun was awesome though had to warm it up the next day to soften. I plan to return to try more just think they need to figure out a better way to reduce the line size!",

    "text": "Seriously? Am I really seeing this? I have reached PMS nirvana. This Francophile has found sweet gastronomic heaven. My dear friend/fellow food/shoe/book junkie and I popped our Amelie's cherry(tart) late on Friday night and were pleasantly surprised by the high energy, efficiency of the staff (they kept that line mooooving!), funky decor and sinful eye candy.   We had ourselves a little sampling and here's the good, the bad and the ugly:  Good: Creme Puffs filled with rich, sweet, thick custard. No wimpy whipped cream here. My toes curled.   The Salted Caramel Brownie. If I'd been w/anyone other than her, they would've been gotten stabbed in the hand w/my fork had they tried to sample this gooey confection. There is close to 1/4 inch of caramel atop this chewey brownie and the addition of a pinch of salt saves this from being too sweet.   The Tea Cakes are very moist. The raspberry has a stronger flavor than the lemon.  The line moves quickly.   The bad: Okay, it really wasn't bad, but my hubby and I tried the Petit Gateau and, while the gnache was rich and smooth (just how I like my men, lol) the cake was actually pretty dry.   The line moves so fast, you may not have a chance to see all the goodies. I like to weigh my options; calories are precious and I can't waste'em on so-so snacks.   Lotsa empty trays. No matter how fast they work, they can't keep up w/demand so it seems like we may have missed some good options.   The Ugly: The near cat-fight over the last eclairs and the creepy mannequin that literally leans over your shoulder as you wait in line. I'm a Leo, I like my space and crazy as it sounds, that thing was giving me the heebies.  Overall, an instant favorite and a reason to haul our tushies down to Charlotte more often.",

Their pastrys are consistantly amazing and the atmosphere is as quirky as they come. I love to come here with friends to hang out or while using their wi-fi:  catching up on hw.   Food: my poison are the little frenh style macarons. Absolutely deliscious! I craved them all summer while i was in oregon and when i came back i had to have one straight off the plane! Over the summer however it seems like the macarons got down sized... but the price stayed the same? While the flavors aren't as exciing as pix patiseiri in portland, they are still awesome. If ur lacking a sweet tooth get a bagete and a couple of their cheese spreads, half and quarter bagettes available. Coffee is awesome here by the way and some others notible confections are: salted carmel brownie, petite fours, mousse cups, and their soups are to die for.  Service and style: servers are rad, style of their own. Very eclectic and kinda makes me feel at home. The only thing that erks me is that when people come in who don't know what to order and clog up the line. There is a system here, please don't be a tourist for too long, especially if there is a million people behind u. LOVE THE DECOR!!!!!!!",

At Amelie's you don't have to trade in your chocolate but please dig your teeth into one of their classic french sandwiches like the croque monsieur and don't leave until you have a pastry... how about a chocolate croissant to go. I really wanted a taste of everything, since they're open 24 hours I probably could have done it.   They also have a great espresso bar, I was really thirsty so I went with a lavender lemonade that was delicious and refreshing.   Relax by yourself, or bring your friends.

Let's be honest, the place is popular because they are open 24 hours a day.    The underage hipsters see it as a great place to all hang out and sit in the cushy little seating areas amongst the odd paint by numbers art and the victorian mish mash and talk about their twitter accounts, tight jeans, and shaggy haircuts without their parents thinking they are getting in trouble.  For the rest of us, its that awesome place to get that last edible nightcap after all the bars have stopped serving food or closed.  I yearn for a sausage egg and cheese croissant after a night of staying on the edge of the mosh pit at the Milestone.  Yes, I have been there during the light of day.

It was tasty, but next time we come here (the will be a next time for sure!) I'd probably try something else, or skip lunch altogether and just pick up some dessert.   We got quite a selection of baked goods, and would order most again. We had some macarons and a salted caramel brownie at the actual restaurant. We both loved the pistachio, but the orange and lemon tasted a little bit like Fruit Loops and seemed stale compared to the pistachio.  We took home a box full of goodies (another brownie, an eclair, a chocolate croissant, two more macarons, and a petit four) that we ate over the next couple of days. All were delicious. Peter said the eclair was exactly what an eclair should be. My favorite was the salted caramel brownie, it was heaven. I am a sucker for anything salty, especially sweet and salty, so this is no surprise.  It was totally worth a stop, but I wouldn't make a special trip to Charlotte just to eat here.",

People were complaining about this and not one of the staff members said sorry for what happened. There were no other open tables to sit at, and Amelie's wouldn't open up her original meeting room for us, so we were forced to leave. In the rain I must add. Amelie's, I had higher expectations for you. Obviously your \"regular\" customers that were in the room with me don't come first. Sorry but definitely won't be going there to sit and study. Maybe I will go to Starbucks or Panera where I know I won't be forced to leave.",

I can eat soup on the hottest day of the year i just LOVE it!!  last two times I was in it was a potato leek with asparagus ( 95% sure) very good both times. I also have the Roast Beef with Borsin cheese on a baguette, my FAV!! I just want the option of having it to be bigger :) just a suggestion!!   I'm not even going to try to start to name all of the pastries I've had from here, because it has been a lot!! All I can tell you is that almost all are great!! Some are not my favorite but you weed them out and find the ones you love!!   In the future I'm going to try and make more of an effort to come here!! PS not sure if y'all heard but they are opening one in uptown across from The Green!!!",

There was an overwhelming line- my husband didn't want to wait but we were there and first timers so I encouraged him to stay.  The line wrapped down the hall and all the way through the seating area!  I was expecting something good for this line!!!  When we finally made it to the front I felt rushed and made a game time decision for a piece of berry and buttercream cake.  My husband got a fruit tart and another flaky pastry.  All were good, but not amazing.  I waited until I was home to enjoy my cake because it wasn't good chilled- the frosting was hard as a rock.  Our lattes were tasty.  But, at $17 for two coffees and a treat we may not be back unless we are in NODA.",

My personal favs: salted caramel brownies (I dream about them), chocolate croissant, spinach asparagus leek soup (all the soups are fantastic), mushroom tartine, turkey and brie sandwich. You really can't go wrong with anything here.   Parking alert for Wednesdays: it's NoDa Run Club night so it's pretty insane in this area. I avoid it all costs.

BUT I will honestly say that I am highly disappointed with your \"cream puffs\". First of all, the filling inside of the pastry was NOT cream, it was CUSTARD and it took up the entire inside of the \"puff\". Second, the pastry was maybe at most a quarter of an inch thick of some sort of dense, chewy dough- not puffed pastry dough whatsoever. They should probably rename these as their French name then elaborate that they are \"like a cream puff but...\".   I was so looking forward to a [filo dough] puffed pastry with cream inside, not a chewy ball filled with custard. This was an unpleasant surprise and next time I will just go to different bakery [or the freezer section of Harris Teeter] to get the typical cream puff instead of here.  Also, even though the macarons have good flavors they seem to always be stale from sitting inside the the case all day. They need to figure out a way to refrigerate them to where the shell doesn't become firm. I've had macarons from both Earth Fare and Cafe Monte yet both of theirs are always soft and practically melt in your mouth.",

The salted caramel brownie was good. I really liked the brownie, and the caramel topping was okay although not really my thing. For $2.50 though, I would expect more than the tiny 1 oz brownie you get. The eclairs were decent too. I didn't really like the pastry part, but the vanilla and chocolate custards were both pretty tasty. My girlfriend and her mom were both disappointed that it was a custard filling rather than cream but enjoyed them nonetheless.  I had one bite of a piece of chocolate cake and it was pretty good as well, but not anything worth $5 for a cupcake sized piece. After waiting in line for 10 minutes (it was Saturday evening, I'll give them that) and seeing the really high prices for the portions, I assumed these desserts must be heaven, but everyone in my group agreed they were just decent and nothing more.",

I know I can get a sweet treat anytime (and I have) So if you have a sweet craving and you are close, or it's late at night, you can come here and satisfy that craving.",

    "text": "Oui ou Non?  Ummm Non. Amelie's French Bakery is not quite \"une boulangerie francaise.\"  The pastries don't remind me of France or even Canada and I suspect it's because of the use of margarine as a substitute for real full fat butter.  There isn't much bread to purchase which usually is a staple at a French bakery and everything taste a bit frozen.  I feel like taking an international flight just to get a delicious pineapple coconut cream cheese ring or a simple freshly made baguette.  The Pros: The staff are the nicest people ever. The shop stays open 24 hours which is rare in Charlotte. The food is visually appealing.  The Cons: The eating area is filthy which makes me nervous about the kitchen. Seating is limited. The decor is a tacky mix of the idea of what Paris should look like mixed with the local thrift store. Overpriced for quality.",

Worse than burnt product is the apathy served by the staff when you draw their attention to the problem. When a customer points out a flaw in service FIX it. I will not be back til they do!!",

The coffee and pastries are A1, but I've never tried anything off of the hot menu. Though I'm sure its delicious.   Best part, they're open 24/7 (still can't figure out the best time for those cream cheese pasteries), and although the line is always super long - the staff is great, and always willing to explain the difference between each and every macaroon.

They are known for their salted caramel brownie bars, so if you go...make sure to order one! I stick with the gluten-free one since it's a little healthier and the taste is no different than their classic. Seating is accommodating for groups of people or people like myself who go alone to enjoy some quiet alone time with a latte and pastry. Other yummy options are their berry salad, liver pate on a baguette sandwich, and their BLT croissant. Highly suggest!   Oh and they're apparently open 24/7!",

They also have an amazing chicken salad croissant and spinach potato leek soup if you're in for lunch.  Beware that this place can get VERY busy during peak hours.

The macaron texture a little airy (need to be tapped on the cookie sheet before baking) and they are heavy handed on the dye, but nice and flavorful.   Atmospherically speaking, this place was fabulous. The decor is lovely and charming, at 5am it was quiet, but I would imagine this would prove the perfect place to chat or work from, especially because it is open 24/7!

When we first pulled up, I noticed that the parking lot was absolutely PACKED, which usually says good things. The decor of Amelie's is quite eclectic, just as the customers are. It marks itself as a French bakery and the art decorating the walls follows that theme. Honestly, it's a gorgeous place. It has a surprisingly large interior with different rooms that are all equipped with extensive seating and tables, as well as two free wi-fi networks. A lot of people were hanging around doing work on MacBooks and eating baked goods. All in all, it appears to be a really funky, awesome place to hang out if you can find a seat.  For the food, I tried the vanilla Creme Brulee ($4.99) and purchased the \"award-winning\" Salted Caramel Brownie ($1.79) for later. First of all, I was amazed at the speed of the guy working the counter/register when there was literally 15 people in line being quite loud. Secondly, the Creme Brulee wasn't as great as I hoped it would be. Something about the taste of it wasn't what I was used to. Regardless, it was still pretty decent. I've yet to try to the brownie, but according to the people beside me in line, it is one of the best things available at Amelie's and well worth the two bucks. My friends both tried different large chocolate creations that tasted about the same, but were both quite delicious (this coming from somebody who isn't a chocolate fan).   The prices at Amelie's are pretty high, but the environment is worth it. My friends and I all enjoyed what we ordered and agreed it was worth the price. Thanks Amelie's for a great experience!",

It's a quaint, casual, little restaurant with a nice selection of sandwiches, soups, and beautiful pastries. I had a Chicken Croissant Sandwich, a cup of delicious Potato Spinach Leek Soup, and a lovely glass of Lavender Lemonade (which was my favorite part). I so enjoyed it all. I'd highly recommend Amelie's.",
