I ordered medium well. When I got my food the manager asked if I needed anything. Said yes I would like some yellow mustard. She said oh no problem. Turned around and began to speak with a friend of hers. After a few min she goes into the kitchen and comes out with somebody else's food. Then starts taking bar orders before she sees me staring at her. Yells at somebody else to get me mustard. Which she did right away. Only to find out my burger wasn't also under cooked but was also completely bland. I couldn't eat it. Just go somewhere else. You'll be better off",

After 15 minutes of waiting, we were told the beer we requested was not available. A completely different woman came up to tell us what we wanted was not available. No problem, things happen. We gave her our 2nd choices and waited... and waited and waited some more. We then got to watch a seat of two and a seat of 6 get sat and placed an order within 5 minutes. To call this an embarrassment of an establishment is an understatement. At least acknowledge your customers. We were completely unacknowledged. Coming from richmond, Va I will say this is the worst place I've ever tried to even get a drink at",

The service is great and the restaurant is clean...the Mario Kart and card games give serious nostalgia is unique for a bar in the epicenter. They offer a nice range of food to choose from as well. I got the hummus which was great and 10 wings tossed in Korean spicy (highly recommend). My only complaint was the beer braut. Probably the most underwhelming thing I've ever seen. A massive philly cheese steak like roll with a piece of meat half the size of the roll. Took me two bites before I had any meat in my mouth. Best solution either put a bigger piece of meat between those buns or find a smaller bun to put the meat in. In this case size matters.",

After seeing this I sent it back, as I do not eat any seafood.  Luckily I am not allergic!!  After biting into my sandwich I noticed the aoli was on it (I had specified on the side).  The server apologizes and brings me a new sandwich which then does not have any au jus... What good is a french dip with out the au jus? Once i started to eat the food it was COLD how is it possible that the food is cold when it should of been a new dish?  The au jus was basically water in a dish no salt nothing.  The chili was completely bland and just as the sandwich cold. Needless to say this place has to get it together, there are much better places in the epicenter.

However once we were seated it took at least 15-20 minutes before someone came to the table to bring waters, not to take our order or even take a drink order. After another 10 minutes or so our server came to the table and took our order. He was polite which was appreciated. During the time it took for him to come to our table initially at least three other parties had been seated. (I only had a party of two.)  By the time we received our beverages one of the parties that arrived after us had already gotten their food. By the time we received our food two of the three parties that came in after us had already received their food and were well into their meal. When we finally got our food mine was fine however my friend had asked for her wings to be fried extra crispy. They were not and so she did not enjoy her meal. I made the server aware of the issue when he returned to the table; he did ask if she wanted him to take it back but she said no because she did not want to wait a long time as we did initially. He said he couldn't make any promises. No type of discount or apology was offered. Again my food was fine; the issue was the service and wait time for wings, fries, and a salad.",

Overall the food was fine, nothing to rave about, and for it being a beer place, our beer order got screwed up each time (for example, one person ordered a Guinness blonde, and a pint of plain came out, and the server argued that it was a blonde, which it clearly was not). I will say the pretzel was on point, and huge, but that was probably the highlight of the entire evening. The tacos were more breading and filling than actual meat, and the wings were rather on the small side.   They do have a large selection of beers and offer flights, so it's a great way to taste some new beers, but it also isn't a spot that warrants a solo trip to the epicenter. I would have to be in the area to head here again, only because there are just better food and beer spots in the city (in my personal opinion).",

There is a small outdoor area with tables and chairs that will be so nice in the summer time. Tons and tons of seating inside. They also have a couch in front of a TV where you can play video games (they had Mario Cart up when we were there).   Typically for all WOBs, there is a large beer selection for both cans/bottles and drafts. I loved that they had tablets where you could see all their beers and filter on various attributes (type, color, ABV, flavor, etc). Additionally, WOB serves liquor and wine. I noticed that this location has food and drink specials every day. On the day we went, it was 25% off cans/bottles and $5 mules. I got a London Mule and it was delish!   While we didn't get any food, they have $5 Happy Hours of small plates. All the food coming out of the kitchen looked good.  Overall, great location and excited to see how they fit into the Epicenter bar scene!",

You will still get the standard local craft but I am still up in arms as to why some locations will flood their menu with mainly local brewery options knowing its easy for tourist and those that live in Charlotte to visit the breweries personally. However I speak for myself, I appreciate the variety. The service is friendly however some days a little slower than you like. The best thing I have had on their food menu so far is the French Dip! It was juicy, the bread was lightly toasted, and the flavor was amazing. My least favorite has been the mac'n'cheese balls because they lacked flavor entirely without the sauce.  I have now also tried some of the tacos: Beer Battered Shrimp, Crispy Beer Brined Chicken and Mahi Mahi. The best taco hands own were the shrimp. I usually have a flight but I ended up getting the sugar creek dubbel.  My beer had a cute little design for the season. Cheers~",

After about 10 minutes of silence I went in to the bar to check if it was bar order only. We were assured that we would receive service outside. That didn't happen. When drink overs were taken - they were delivered  in 20 minutes. Our water in 10. Laughing it off with the waitress I walk in to have a discussion with the \"manager.\" He mentioned running out of the ingredients for the sangria (the special.) I wanted him to understand that over 20 minutes for beverages -!is not a good thing. He agreed, and said his sorrys and we'd be taken care of.  I'm not sure what his version of \"taking care of us\" is. It was not us receiving better/prompter service. It certainly wasn't comping any percentage off the bill.  We are a group of LGBT friends, so turning to the bill and seeing the daily special shown as \"girls night discount was otherwise a homophonic jab taken or, just some antiquated, albeit sexist, stereotypes.   Regardless, it was a soft 1 on a 10 point scale. I'd look deeper into management and staff.",

Not much to share although we did.   The restaurant has a bar, high top and low top tables as well as an outside area for dining. The menu has several options at a decent price.  They offer lunch specials for around $7.99.    The floors were super sticky.  One on my shoes keep sticking to the floor where I had to make an effort to pick it up. I'm sure it was a fluke as I haven't read any other reviews with this issue.   Enjoy!",

After a while I just asked her for a menu, she looked bothered then asked someone else to get it for us. Once she noticed he gave us an empty book she got us the right menus. I kind of then assumed maybe she wasn't a bartender until after she took her time drying glasses she finally started taking some orders. Shorty after another bartender asked have we been helped and we said no, he replied he would be right back to help us. Right after a different bartender came asked the same question but took our drink order. We got an Old Fashion & a Mule, both made pretty fast. They had a $5 food menu for HH. We ordered the Mac n Cheese bits which were really good, loved the sauce that went with them. Also ordered the Barbacoa tacos and the were good as well.

    "text": "Kinda remember having WOB located on South Blvd a couple years ago, which shut down. I was lucky to come to the new location at Epicenter around lunch time yesterday. Far from crowded. I got this tasty raspberry flavored beer which was awesome. Our waitress was good at explaining the beer menu to us. Food menu looks good too. Hoping WOB will open more locations in the future.",

    "text": "This place was good. I'd honestly give it a three because of my barely cold, skunk line Blue Moon beer on tap BUT my fish tacos were awesome.   We stopped in on a Sunday evening and the place was pretty busy but we got a table with no problem. We were met by staff very quickly and given menus. I ordered a Blue Moon on tap and my bros asked for an IPA recommendation. The waiter, bless his heart brought them some pineapple beer that wasn't even close to an IPA lol  Anyway the savior of the restaurant for me were the Mahi Mahi tacos. Perfectly cooked fish with I believe blackened spice on them with coleslaw and house made tarter sauce. Delicious! My bros got the wings and steak. Both were good according to them. We all shared some Mac n cheese bites that were very good as well.   I'd recommend this place. Their food is good(get the Mahi Mahi tacos!) and the beer selection is impressive. Go beyond Blue Moon though lol They have well over 100 beers in cans/bottles in case you don't want to risk skunk tap line",

    "text": "Really good food but the service is a little too slow. The music and crowd size were pretty good, just looked like they might've been short staffed. On a regular day, that might not have been as big of an issue, but we were really hungry & had just come from the airport so the amount of time it took for our drinks to come and then to wait another 30 mins(1 hour total) for our food was a bit much.",

    "text": "We came here to participate in The Office themed trivia. They had some great specials running. However, We had very poor service. The waiter seemed to forget about us and mix up our orders often. We had to ask for our bill multiple times. Then the bills were incorrect. However, I give this place four stars because the food is really good for pub food. I would recommend the pretzel! And also the nachos!",

    "text": "I'm not sure if I'm completely sold on this World of Beer location.   They are located on the corner of the 2nd floor at the EpiCenter. It's a large location with multiple tables inside. Some of the tables are awkwardly placed so you have to squeeze past people just to leave.   For some reason, every World of Beer has slow service and this one is no exception.   We got a flight that was nice, cold, and enjoyable. We also ordered the pretzel and got upsold on the beer cheese. The pretzel was delicious but the beer cheese is just not good at all to me. For my meal, I ordered the bowl Bibimbap and it was pretty good. The only downside is that I could tell it was sitting in the window for a good minute because it wasn't served hot. The flavors were spot on and the portion was perfect. My boyfriend got the beer brat and the portion was laughable. Poor thing. He said it was okay taste wise but he ended up eating some of my food to fill him up.   Overall, I would return for beer and appetizers if I was at the EpiCenter but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit.",
