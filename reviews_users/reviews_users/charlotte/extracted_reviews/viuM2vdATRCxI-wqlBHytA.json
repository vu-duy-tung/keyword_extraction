    "text": "This place is a lot of fun to go to with a group of 6 people. I went for my friend's birthday and she had a party of 12. The line outside to purchase a $5 membership card (needed to play) was super long. Due to the cold weather, one would think the management here would come up with a more effective way to get the line moving. After getting the membership we went to the bar area and got the Pineapple punch golf bag drink ($16). We were told that we couldn't order the drink individually and that there had to be two ppl available to drink it. I think this is just some sort of gimmick to make people think that the drink is very large or very strong. The drink was neither. It was an average sized drink and pretty watered down. And I wasn't impressed by the taste. But you get to take the nice golf bag cup home that lights up... So that's a plus. I also ordered the Kentucky Caramel coffee which is Jim Beam, Kahlua, caramel sauce, coffee, with whipped cream and 2 donut holes on top. It was underwhelming, but drinkable. The donut holes are really good though.  We went to our bay (which they put both halves of our party side by side b/c there is a 6 person max per bay). The game was super fun even though I wasn't good at it and if you don't have 6 people in your party... I will say that the price is kind of high especially at night.   I ordered the chili with a side of french fries. The chili was a little bit on the greasy side but it had good flavor. The cornbread that was given on top of the chili had jalapenos and cheese in it, so it had good potential but the only issue was that it wasn't fully cooked. The fries were a disappointment. I would suggest eating before you come to top golf to avoid disappointment. But it was an overall good time.",

The place is very busy but when I sat at a table for a bite to eat the staff was quick, efficient and the food was good. I had fries and chicken tenders while I waited for the birthday girls and others. We got called for our bay. Although the weather was cold and bit rainy, we were toasty and dry! I was so excited about that. Even though the bays are partially outside you won't get cold or wet. The game was super easy and fun to play. I had a blast and would recommend it to any group for a great night out. The staff set everyone up for the computer to display our turns, checked on us periodically, and cashed us out when we were done. The prices were reasonable and you can just hold on to your membership card for next time. You have got to try it! Even if you're not good at golf you will have a great time!",

The heated sofa is enough for me to go back on its own- I normally freeze and even while playing the heaters kept me warm - playing was super fun and easy and the food we got was all yummy - tried most all of the appetizers and sliders. Plus our server was right on top of it. Can't wait to go back again and again and again-  Keep up the great fun Topgolf! See you soon",

The second time I went on a Saturday midday.The wait was 2.5-3hrs wherein we did receive a bay in the expected time frame.We enjoyed the bar once again while we waited.The actual game is so much fun and way better than putt putt golf.We truly enjoyed ourselves and shared many laughs.The waitress for our bay was on point and served us effectively.Overall,we didn't have any complaints and will be back for another game.I recommend this place for any occasion.",

ITS VERY UNORGANIZED, UNDERSTAFF, UNTRAINED STAFF AND DID I SAY UNORGANIZED??!!!!!!! I can understand the wait for the bay (to Golf) but I can not understand the 15 mins wait for the waitress to even come to the table , 15 to even get your drinks, 1 hour for your food. And on TOP that I told waitress i was vegetarian SO WHY DID SHE LET  ME ORDER SOMETHING WITH MEAT!! ...That's part of the untrained STAFF. I told her I wanted to change my order to a veggie burger and then she came BACK TO THE TABLE 20 MINUTES LATER AND SAID SO YOU WANT ME TO PUT A VEGGIE IN FOR YOU? And I said so you did not already but it in? Also employees that was delivering the food keep going to different table asking the guest \"is this your food\"! They did not even know what tables order what !!   By the way the Veggie Burger is really good!!   THE NEED SOME SERIOUS HELP HERE!!",

We had heard such good things we decided to do it as a splurge to honor my husband. We had fun but our computer had tons of glitches and a big lag time. It made it virtually impossible to keep an accurate score, since it would attribute one person's ball to another player etc. We did ask for help and were shown how to correct a score but could never get the computer to save our changes. We were told that sometimes the computers get too hot and don't function properly. That seems odd for an outdoor venue in the south. We also thought we were going to get an intro to the system and games etc but pretty much has to fend for ourselves which burned a lot of time. I might not have been as bothered had it been a half price day but for $120 for three of us to play for two hours I expected a lot more.",

    "text": "Topgolf is nothing short of an experience. It feels like a real life video game and is a blast for anyone who is accustomed to swinging a golf club or not. In addition you can expect decent grub and a wide selection of drinks to go along with a fun evening. It is definitely a place you want to take visitors if they are looking for a unique and interactive experience.  I'll start of with two asterisks: (1) my company has a platinum membership which affects my cost and experience and (2) I have only been during the middle of the day. I've seen the lines get long and heard it can be crazy in the evening, so you can take what I have to say with a grain of salt. That being said, the few times I have been have always been a blast. I am still amazed at the technology of the games. Essentially, you use an interactive screen to navigate different games and when it's your turn, you swipe your golf club over a laser sensor and a ball with a tracker pops out. Depending on where your ball goes (aiming for big targets here), you get points. It's fun to see what you can do and the scoring makes it a lot more entertaining than a driving range. Even if you aren't good at golf (like me), its still a great experience and I find that this place pulls a lot of newbies in so don't worry about standing out.  I had also mentioned the food earlier. I've had a burger, sliders, and chips/guac in the past and everything has been great. Some tips: make sure to get their early if you have never been, you need to get a membership card. Also this place can get crazy in peak hours - but everything lights up at night which is certainly a fun experience. Now go and check it out!",

I also had a Tequila  sunrise which was made just right. By the time we were done eating I was receiving text saying our station was ready for golfing. It was fun and we did an hour. It was 33 degrees outside but they had heaters on outside. The wait staff offered a hot cup of water just for hold to keep hands warm. I thought that was a great gesture. Friendly staff, clean facility and a bit noisy on the inside, kids are allowed and appeared some birthday parties were going on. Since alcohol is served, I wouldn't suggest small children.

On our last visit (Saturday @ 11:30am) the food was of poor quality and our waitress Anna Marie shift leader from CA was rude to our group. I felt really bad because I had talked this place up and brought 6 out of state guests here to visit. I felt our group was very polite, saying please and thank you, but she did role her eyes at us a couple times and then she was talking poorly about our  group with another staff member. I know this I could see her throwing her hands up in the air frustrated shaking her head and the person she was talking to kept looking over at us. She did get a couple of our orders wrong, which she did fix, but wasn't happy about it. The food came out room temp and did not taste fresh. Also someone at our table said they were scared to ask for a refil on their coke as they were afraid she would get upset. I'm hoping this was just an isolated event, since I had such an amazing experience the other 2 times I visited.",

    "text": "We LOVE Top Golf - seriously what's better than a driving range with food & cocktails??? My son (he's 8) begs to go all the time. We gave it a shot a couple of months ago and were gravely disappointed in the service we received. (It's taken me awhile to write the review). First off, the woman who waited on us was MEAN. I mean downright MEAN. We had to ask for side plates and she seemed annoyed and took 15 mins to return. Our friend had her 3 year old with her and he's a picky eater. When she pulled out a juice box and some fruit snacks for him, the waitress attacked, \"you cannot eat outside food here\" - everyone else ordered (extra) food and drinks .... we plead with her as this little boy literally eats NOTHING else. She was so annoyed she'd roll her eyes and look at us like we were morons. We begged!!! Aggravated, She said she'd get a cup for his drink and honestly never returned. We suddenly got a new waitress who seemed semi- empathetic - but that first one set a tone. We felt horrible and she literally acted like we were bothering her. We finished our game quickly at that point..... we love this place and have never experienced such a rude waitress. We just hope she doesn't last - because we want to go back!!",

This place was jam packed and I had a sense of dread walking in to be pleasantly surprised of how organized the reservation and play process was!  The company's sends text to alert you of when your bay is ready, and you have a server who walks you through how to use the amenities at your bay and order food.  It was a Friday and they had a DJ which added fun and excitement to the ambience and the DJ was mindful to play family friendly music.  The place, even for a Friday night, was very family friendly.  We didn't feel out of place.   The team there is user friendly and are willing to answer our multiple questions.  I will definitely return and will like to try locations in other cities!",

    "text": "Don't let my photos fool you - this is the place to go if you are looking for slow service, sassy service, mischarges, and cold food. Is anyone looking for those things though?   I heard the HYPE around Topgolf and was really excited to take my mind off Hurricane Irma at Topgolf with some family. Unfortunately, the experience was one of the worst I've ever had. Please note: this is only my 2nd 1st review EVER.  The line was out the door, so I assumed that the hype was right and it would be worth the wait. We were quoted about an hour or two for a bay, but we didn't have a problem with that since we were hungry. We went to an open rooftop bar to grab drinks and lunch. After 30 minutes, we realized that we weren't going to be served without hunting someone down.  Finally, we ordered and got our drinks. First, they brought out four appetizers when we only ordered two. Unfortunately, our server had us pay BEFORE we got our food since we were going to move to a bay, and we paid an extra $18 for the two appetizers that we didn't order. Granted that's our fault for not paying closer attention to the bill.  We moved to the bay, and our server told us that he'd have our food brought to the new bay. When it finally came, there were a lot of missing items from the order, and the food was cold. Most likely, the food had been sitting for a while since our first server was not very bright. Our server at the bay didn't make our experience any better. I actually ordered two more beers from a server at another bay since our server Jessie never came back for us. Corrie was the server that I hunted down, and he did get me the two beers but I had to open a separate tab with him.  The manager did stop by but her customer service skills were no better than anyone else that we interacted with. She blamed us for the problem, didn't listen to the situation, and didn't have any resolution before she just walked away...  Your money and time would be better spent somewhere else. The IDEA is fantastic, but the execution is horrible.",

There's a lot of different games you can play and time goes by so quickly you don't even realize you've been playing for hours... until your time is up and you have to add more.  We've played during the day and at night and both are a little different but equally fun. During the day you can see the targets easier and watch your ball, but at night the lights really make it a inquire experience.",

    "text": "You know...I'm actually sad to leave this review. My SO and I have been to Topgolf locations in 4 states now, and this one has left MUCH to be desired.   We arrived around 11:30am on the day after Christmas. We got a bay on the first floor because there wasn't a wait (45m+ for the 2nd d 3rd level). I needed a set of left hand clubs, which are usually sent down to the bay...but at this location you take them yourself (not an issue, just noting one of the differences in our experience). Now, where the issues did start were once we got to our bay.   When I got downstairs I was still waiting for my SO, who was walking his service pup before coming in. One of the staff members was at the bay waiting for us to get things set up. I put in our member info and told her I was waiting for the second player. She asked if I knew what to do next, I told her we did....and then she pressed start on our time...which begins the *paid* time...even though not all party members were present. She disappeared before I could say anything. Within seconds our server came and I brought it up with him and he had a dismissive, \"Yeah, there's nothing we can do once the time starts. You can start without the other person. What can I get you to drink?\" attitude. I don't know about others, but typically we like to settle in to our spot and get set up before starting (you know, like having all members of the party present and such). We lost about 15min of play.   Other issues: When the server brought my drink, he took my SOs order and a food order. The drink arrived 15m later after being asked about it and the food arrived 10m before the end of our game...all we ordered was the toast trio. We saw a staff member a total of 3 times during our visit (that we didn't have to actively seek out), the third time of course was when we were asked if we wanted to extend our time. Go figure.  Overall, this was an extremely disappointing experience that based on what we have experienced with other locations, is not at all what we expected.",

    "text": "As an experience this is 5 stars, but I have a hard time giving 5 stars (so that's on me).  First tip is go ahead and get your $5.00 membership online before you go so you don't have to stand in the line to even do that.  There are other membership levels available as well.  Once you have your QR code you can go directly to the concierge and they will print your card.  Once you have your card you can take that to the desk and they will put you on the list for the next available bay.  You can pay a fee to jump the line, but if it's super busy it may not be worth it.    Another tip is to make sure everyone has their own membership and card ready to go.  If you're trying to play off of one card you can, but it makes it difficult to keep up with scores if there are more than two or three people.  It is a game system so it isn't a typical driving range although I guess you could make it that if you wanted.  All the balls are gps chipped so that it will tell you if you scored points, distance etc...  It's really just a fun party atmosphere though.  If you're looking for a nice peaceful driving range experience this isn't for you.  Also if you have children that will be offended or emotionally disturbed by loud vulgar language and loud boorish behaviors by people drinking and partying then be advised you might be sitting next to that.  I'm sure staff wouldn't let it get too out of hand, but there you go;  it's several bars with a driving range.   There are three levels and I'm not sure if it's every night, but the 3rd level area turns into a dance party at some point in the evenings and the range/games are lit up and adjust in time to the music.  Way cool.  Once they text you that your bay will be available they will escort you to it and get you set up with your server and show you how to set up for game play and how to extend time etc...  The hosts and servers are all very good and nice and accommodating.  They have full bar service and standard bar food.  It is expensive and you will spend more than you think you will so it may say $$$31-60 but you will pay $$$$ over $61 almost guaranteed.  Another tip is that there are price differences depending on when you go.  Sometimes you get there early for the lower price, but you don't get in before the rates go up, so be aware of that.  Every bay is equipped with lounge seating, tv display for the range and another tv that seems to be set to the same channel, but you might have the option to change it to another channel for your viewing pleasure...not sure, but probably.  It is loud, it is hot but it's a fun change of pace and I'm glad it's here!",

For my surprise to get a reservation I had to pay I reservation fee. Which was fine by me but I thought it was weird. We got there 5 minutes before our appointment and the lady said we would have to wait until they had a free land for us. ????? So what was the point of me paying for a reservation? Anyways, we went to the bar ordered some drinks and an appetizer that was really good. We had a type of spring roll filled with Mac and cheese and bacon that was really good! In general their menu is pretty decent and not expensive at all. I was expecting some exorbitant prices for the food but fortunately I was wrong. After 15 minutes I got a text on my phone saying our lane was ready. When we get there a member of their staff was waiting for us and explained how everything worked. I decided to order a hamburger and my husband a chicken sandwich. The food was good, even tho they messed up our sides we decided just go with it and did not asked to have it switched.  The place is fun, it is an ambient for all ages and you don't need to be a golf pro to have fun!  I will probably be back at some point. However, I was really expecting way more from this place.",

Nicole C. Proceeded to greet all other tables around us. It appeared she only had three tables the entire night but checked on us maybe 3 times in three hours. She forgot to ring in our wings and took 20 to 30 to bring out more drinks. For a place that we have to pay 45 dollars an hour you would think the service would be at least okay. I want to come back but will probably eat and drink before hand next time. I even asked for a manager at one point and she really didn't care. Being a former server it was probably the worst service I've had.",

    "text": "Definitely had a better experience today than I did on opening night. I suppose I showed up at just the right time because there was no wait. Checked in swiftly and with about a 5 or 10 minute wait was at a bay. Wait staff just needs to work out some kinks and familiarize themselves with the menu better. Also ensuring tables in the bays are properly equipped upon being seating with napkins/silverware (I had to ask for these items twice). Sadly there is still no assistance with parking which is a major ISSUE. It's two lanes in/out. To lessen the headache with parking, once I reached the front I just paid the $5 for valet. When people start parking on the side of the road it limits the lanes down to one, which makes it difficult for vehicles in both directions. For smaller groups (three in my party) I think an hour is plenty, larger groups defined would recommend 2 hours. Looking forward to returning and glad to see Topgolf here in the Queen City.",

Our server was DeShawn and he was absolutely wonderful. Handled all the multiple food and drink orders and was always ready to assist us with whatever we needed.

The wait time/crowd was to be expected for a Friday afternoon, but what wasn't expected was the following: 1. Cashier who took my payment entered the amount of cash I gave to her and neglected to give me the proper change. 2. Waited 15mins after receiving our bay to be greeted by a server 3. Once our food was received, there was hair in one of the wraps we ordered and debris in our water glass 4. We had to wait another 30mins for the crew to switch out before we were able to get any refills (mind you it is almost 100 degrees outside)  Maybe they need to hire more competent employees or maybe they haven't been able to adjust with the amount of business they are receiving. Hopefully it will get better.",

We went the the outdoor bar on the third floor after and it was a good place to have a drink on a nice day! Plus ours came in a cool golf cup with a golf straw!

I finally asked an employee who said he would find a server and send them over. Another 5-10 minutes pass and still no server. There were a ton of employees passing through but no one even looked at us. I headed upstairs to find a manager and finally they sent a server to our table. The manager said \"they had been going through a transition\".   Finally ordered food. My husband ordered chicken wings and he said they were the worst wings he had ever had. One of the pieces did not look like any distinguishable piece of chicken I had ever seen.   When we went to golf, the server was no wheee to be found. I asked another one how it worked to transfer the ticket. He told me to come back after we knew what bay we were assigned to. I did and the waitress had already closed out the ticket because she assumed we left.  Another hassle to get the ticket reopened.   The golf was not scoring properly so we had 3 different staff members troubleshooting throughout the time.   Overall, the concept should have been fun but they need to train their staff and add a lot more customer service skills. We will not return.",

I dont like that you cant make reservations ahead of time, so I had to make my client wait when we got there. It seemed to take the girl a really long time to make our top golf playing car, I was just having mine reprinted and my client was getting a new one and it took about 10 minutes just to get our card. Then we had to go over to try to get a lane which he said the wait would be 15 mins.  We waited at the bar and ordered some drinks and food, thinking we could just take the food to the lane when we got it. Well our lane took a lot longer than he said so we had our food and no where to sit, so it was kind of awkward. The lane took 40 mins.  With all that being said, the actually game of top golf was awesome! We had a lot of fun, and it was not as expensive as I thought it would be. All in all it was a good time, but I think I will wait till it dies down so the wait wont be so long.",

Many people have complained about the check-in....it's a little ludicrous, but a little research will save you time (Pro tip: get your membership ahead of time and reserve your bay early).  The one BIG plus...for this place being such a madhouse, none of the employees were rude or pushy. The game itself was great. Staff explained options and it was just fun. This the 5 star part. I'm not a golfer, but it's kind of like a high-end bowling alley...but golf. The food was good too. Now the zero..... Bathrooms!!! Top Golf needs more or they need to keep them monitored. It's just unacceptable to have the ladies room closed especially when you're on a 5-hour wait. The men's room was open but it such a sorry state the health department would have closed them down. I usually don't' advertise when I puke, but that great BBQ Grilled Cheese I had eaten an hour before came right up because of the nausea inducing men's room.  Besides the checkin and the bathrooms this was a pretty fun night, but I would wait until the new factor wears off before returning.",

Thirty minutes later we saw her again and she advised she had an event that she was setting up for and that she wasn't supposed to have anyone in our section and apologized for the delay in coming to us. We let her know it was no problem and no need to apologize. From that point on we saw her sporadically. Everyone in our group had to ask for drinks and items multiple times. She constantly cut and rolled her eyes, never picked up plates, never refilled drinks, and every request seemed to be a nuisance to her. I asked for to go boxes twice and 40 minutes later we had not received the Togo boxes. . . We let her know a third time that we still had not gotten them and her response \"I'm grabbing them (pointed in a general direction) I had other stuff I was doing.\" Then proceeds to reach in the drawer DIRECTLY behind us and grab to go boxes. Ridiculous. TopGolf is usually a great experience. But this week Alexis ruined the experience.",

For example, my boyfriend had just finished up our game and I was finishing up my glass of wine but instead of allowing me to do so they made me get up from our table and go stand off to the side to stand and finish my wine before leaving just so they could go ahead and sit the next people at our table. We're paying customers, actually already paid customers, so that was just wrong.",

    "text": "Had a three hour wait tonight which we didn't mind at first because the experience is usually worth it. No one ever asked us how many people were in our party so when we finally got our lane our party of eight was cramped and the computer system did not accept more than six which led to a lot of confusion. The person that rang us in said we could switch the names around during the second game which wasn't the case. When we ran out of balls we waited a little for someone to come add some- didn't really take too long but asked that we be reimbursed for the time that was used while we waited (probably about ten minutes) and our waitress rolled her eyes at us for the SECOND time tonight. Prince was her name. Too much attitude and not enough pants. Usually love it but kind of embarrassed that we dragged friends out to wait forever for such shitty service. The bartender upstairs by the stage wasn't our server but was super nice.",

There was a wait but that was expected for a holiday weekend. They allow you to wait at the upper or lower bar, order food, order drinks, and mingle with other guest. The ladies room is very clean. The staff was very nice considering who busy it was and how flustered some of them were. The only thing I didn't like was that you HAD to have your membership card with you or pay another $5 to receive a new card. Obviously it's another way to make money but it's frustrating. There should be a system that customers should be able to attend without physically having a card. Prices are great. Food was even better. Well worth the trip and will definitely be back again soon.",

This is the third time this has happened to us and the fourth time this has happened to our friend. This is absolutely ridiculous terrible customer service. We asked the person at the desk why we were told 1 hour when it was actually 3-4 and she told us that the main desk doesn't even have a number that you can call, only the main office does. The main office does not even know the actual waiting times. We are mostly angry because the main office was just the corporate office that has no real connection to what is going on. Terrible, terrible customer service. I understand that we could have made reservations, but this was a last minute decision and we called in advance. Plus even if we did, we would have to pay a fee just to reserve a bay. And the fee doesn't goes towards the cost, it is purely a fee for reserving the actual bay and from what we were told at the desk it would have been a $50 reservation fee.",

We constantly had to repeated requests for napkins but none of this was really a big deal. As we waited to check out, they charged us for a membership fee even though we already had memberships. This was resolved. But when one member of our party asked for a box to take home the item that came late, the red-shirted Kelly, cleared away the food without asking and was very rude to our party. No apology for the mistake. But only muttered that she would replace the order, however didn't even wait for our response. The two servers were nice and were more concerned about the mistake than she was. We were polite the entire time but Kelly was not.",

Customer service is not good at this time.  30 minute wait on Thursday afternoon. Got to golf bay and computer didn't work. Took 15-20 minutes for the \"guest services\" person to be found and show up. 10 minutes later he was frustrated but got it going and comped us an extra hour. 40 minutes in, the entire establishment blacked out and our computer locked up again. Don't forget your waiter is just that..a waiter..they are not educated in the ways of anything but bringing food. But she did try and find the \"guest services\" person who eventually showed up after my brother raised cane..!!  After he showed up..it took this guy 10-15 minutes to reset the computer then he realized the bay had been rented for a corporate outing and made us move..!!! but he also comped us another hour and an appetizer for the problems. So we moved. Card still has 2 hours of play time on it but we decided to leave after playing only 1 hour. Leaving 1 hour of play time on the card. No where on the computer is there a place to click to save unused time..!!!  Again, waiter has now idea how to save time or even if you can. Waited for \"guest services \" 5-10 minutes, we went to the main counter and was told YOU CAN NOT SAVE UNUSED TIME. WE WERE TOLD YOU MUST HAVE A \"GUEST SERVICE\" PERSON COME TO YOU BOOTH AND DO THIS FOR YOU.  A very aggravating afternoon.",

    "text": "This was my very first visit to Topgolf. Hopefully it's not like this in every Topgolf location. For now, this review is only for their restaurant on the main level. Service was extremely poor. Took about 15 mins to get somebody to clean our table. Then it took about an extra 15 mins to get our order. Then our drinks never came. Food arrives about 25 mins after we ordered and still no drinks yet. My wife had to personally get our drinks from the bar and bring them to our table! Just terrible service. Food was just okay. We ordered the following: 1. Pepperoni Flatbread - we requested the pepperoni to be placed on the side coz my daughter doesn't eat them, and when the server brought it to our table, he accidentally dropped all the pepperoni on the floor, stared at it and picked them up and never returned with a replacement pepperoni! Unbelievable! Taste was good. 2. The G.O.A.T. Which is a caramelized french toast, maple syrup, Cap'n Crunch breaded fried chicken, jalapeno gravy, over easy egg, green onion, chopped bacon, Cholula. - this was actually pretty good. 3. Veggie Burger - my wife did not like it. So don't order this when you are here. They were a bit quicker when they want you to pay your check. Totally the opposite of when we were about to order. They were so hard to get their attention when you need them. It even seems like they were avoiding us. But when it comes to the check, we didn't even call them and they were there asking if we wanted the check.  Our current wait time for golf is 2.5 hours, so I don't know about the golf aspect of Topgolf yet. Hope it gets better than here.",

Also, you can make reservations for $50 but the $50 does NOT go towards your payment. The area was cool and not too hot. We played for an hour with 4 people total and it really wasn't that bad time wise. We could of played another hour if we wanted but we were a little over it.

My dad flew into town to visit and us kids that live in NC wanted to treat him to a dinner and Top Golf for Father's Day. It was his first time ever going and we were so excited to show him what a great time it is. He was also really, really excited (he typically stays with the grandkids and babysits when we all go)   The whole night was so disappointing. We are 100% fine waiting for a bay...we do nearly every time we go. However, that wasn't the problem. Last night the service was so bad. Took 55 minutes to get food and our server just seemed so absentminded. She was sweet - but we had to ask for plates, silverware and refills. We were there for 2 hours and we only got one refill. The food was cold when it got to us and just not very good. We always order the same thing and they were sold out of some of the items and the ones we got weren't as good as usual.   The experience of golfing was off too! A large amount of our balls weren't registering. In the 2 hours we were there the balls weren't cleared once and the place was covered in golf balls. It looked like snow in some areas there were so many accumulated. Most of our balls were bouncing and ricocheting off others, which really messes with the score.   I would've given 2 stars based on our experience last night but majority of the time we go there it's great so that doesn't feel right. My main concern is the company is getting casual now that the hype has gone down.",

We stopped here after brunch on a Sunday WITHOUT reservations. *Note- I would definitely make reservations before coming here so that you don't have to wait as long and you can get a bay that is on one of the upper floors. We got a bay on ground level, and while it was fun, I think it would have been more fun being higher up. Anyways, we had to wait for about 30 min and then we were set up at a bay. Everything is pretty self explanatory, but there was employees walking around in case you have any questions. I did have to request left handed clubs and they brought them over very quickly. Top Golf is like being at a driving range, but you compete with your group by getting points based on the targets you hit. You don't have to be Tiger Woods out here- Top Golf is made for golfers of all expertise- or lack thereof, in my case. I'm so happy there is a Top Golf where I live, so that I can go again. It was definitely a fun experience and a good way to get out of the house to do something fun!",

It's essentially a driving range but they added games to it so it can be enjoyed by golf connoisseurs and your average Joe (i.e. me).   Me and my friends came here at like 9 pm and rooms are about $45 a pop after 5pm so it's kinda pricey but it's not bad if you split it! The room can hold up to 6 people and they also have military discount.   The staff at Top Golf are very help at explaining the game and how everything works so don't worry about that. But if it is your first time you are required to pay for a membership which is like $5, but after that you never have to pay again (I hope).  The only reason I took off a star was because my boyfriend got a Long Island Iced Tea and it was super watered down. It had so much ice and tasted like it had almost no alcohol in it, so it wasn't really worth it.  Overall I would definitely go to TopGolf cuz it's super fun, just don't buy drinks here. At least not the Long Island",

    "text": "A restaurant with a really cool golf element.  I say it's a restaurant first because that's how they treat guest and most importantly, cook and serve their food. You'll consider coming here solely for a meal after experiencing the food for the first time. Look, it's not 5 Star, fine dining cuisine, but it's actually leaps and bounds better than any Applebee's, Chili's, or other garbage chain restaurant.   Everything from breakfast, to Asian, to Southwestern, Top Golf has it all and I've yet to have anything that's gross. Don't expect to get arcade or bowling alley quality of food; you can go to Dave and Busters for that crap.  If you're not a golfer, even if you have never swung a golf club, you will absolutely have a good time. This game is for everyone with any level of golfing skill (or not).   There's a lot to be said about a place that still has ridiculous long wait times even after being open for over a year. It's impressive and everything about the facility is impressive. You will undoubtedly have a blast. 5/5 and if I could give it more, I would.",

    "text": "Yeah, I suck at this, but I had a pretty good time!  Me and three of my friends rolled up on a Friday night around 8PM and despite it being very crowded we were able to get a bay on the lower level without a wait. It's a very simple concept, imagine combining a driving range with skee-ball and you've pretty much got a grasp of TopGolf!  While I had some really long drives, I was not accurate enough to make that translate to BIG points on the board. A few of my friends were VERY successful at racking up smaller, yet more consistent points by going for the closer targets. I was the stubborn one and would drive the ball 200+ yards trying to get the big, white target in the back, and failing miserably. I think I see why the middle and upper level are the ones that have the wait list. For one, the balls are very low-flying. I'm assuming this is because of the microchips inside, the dynamics are a bit different from your typical driving range. The other reason is you can't really follow your ball traveling to the target from the lower level, it must be much easier from the upper levels.  With regard to the food, we only got fries and chips w/ salsa and guac, but I was really surprised with the quality of both. To be honest, I was expecting the food to be of 'bowling alley' caliber but the Guacamole was very fresh, seasoned well, and had a great texture. Whether it was homemade or not, it was good enough to get me to order two in the same night! Next time we'll dive into the menu a bit more.  I have to give props to the staff, our waitress Tima was very attentive and checked in on us very frequently, not a single cup went empty! Dan the manager introduced himself as soon as we got to our bay. As we were leaving they were dealing with a guy who wanted to smoke inside AND drink outside, neither of which are allowed by local or state laws... I'm sure they must deal with stuff like this a lot but they did well.  I think with a bit more practice I could go pro. Looking into getting a jersey and I'm currently accepting sponsorship deals.

    "text": "Topgolf is a blast! I have been here 3 times now each time with a different group of people. It seems to be an activity for all types and ages. My parents loved it and so did my friends. I am not a golfer and still had a great time. It is a casual environment and you have your own section. The prices once split amongst the group are more expensive than bowling but reasonable and way more fun than bowling. I went on a friday night at 7, Friday night at 5:30, and a Saturday afternoon. Each time we were able to find parking (sometimes harder than others but still possible).   My issues with Topgolf are the food and the service. All three times ordering food and drinks took so long as our server was very busy and hard to find. They rarely come by so I have learned to over order when the server is there. The food I have had there was sub par - tater tots were yummy with dipping sauces but the chicken sandwich was pretty average and dry.",

There are 3 levels with bays. We ended up on the lowest level which was very nice. Our section has high top tables , and there are some booths as well.   There are heaters and fans to keep you comfortable in all seasons and a very accommodating waitstaff, who will help you get set up on your game and bring drinks and food. I had a strawberry margarita which was okay, and no food.  Once set up on the game , you get to choose from various male and female clubs to hit balls dispensed from a machine at your bay. The point is to shoot for accuracy . Accuracy being as close to one of the flags as possible.   They open as early as 9AM and stay open late. This is a great place to burn a lot of time , and fun while doing it.",

It was pretty cool because we waited at the bar and got drinks and then we received a text message to let us know what bay we needed to go to.  When we got to the bay, an employee set us up and gave us a quick tutorial. Be advised if it's your first time you will be charged a one time $5 membership fee in order to play. The best part of this experience was that the bays were heated including the seats!   The food was also really good! The pizza had way too much oregano but the portions were big and the prices weren't bad at all! I think my favorite food that we ordered was the queso--so good!!!",

Great cocktails and the most amazing 40-ounce burger and fries I've had eating out in years. Slice it pizza style and feed a crowd on the cheap. And who doesn't love injecting your own donut holes? Our waiter was great, too. Oh, that would be Deon.",

First, half my party was from out of town and they made everyone sign up for a membership card even though they don't live in the state and don't have a top golf by them and had to pay for the membership cards for them to only use once! We got food at the bar while waiting for a bay to open and the server waited around until 12 so we couldn't order brunch even though it was only 11:40  and brunch is over with at noon. They also don't have good sitting for older people my grandma had to fight the the bar stool because they were so high up and they have no tables to sit at to accommodate older people. We moved to our bay and no one told our server we moved so we waited almost 1  1/2 for food that wasn't even that good and our order wasn't even right and they had to remake it 3 times before getting a pizza with no cheese right due to a dairy allergy. Getting Togo boxes was a nightmare I ended up going to the kitchen door to ask for them from a kitchen member. Last but not least let's not forget it was so hot due to the heaters because they had them on way to high and the music speakers were way to loud I couldn't even talk without having to yell to my family. Overall one on the worst Christmas presents ever the staff is just so rude, snobby, and sassy from all employees including the manager!",

By the time we got to the \"concierge\" it was up to 90 min because they had some events going on.  We decided to wait.  While we waited we saw over 30 empty bays that never filled in.  After 105 min I went back to the \"concierge\" to see what was going on.  She then quoted me another 2 hours!?  I immediately asked for my money back and was referred to the manager.  He said they had corporate events and they had to keep the bays open because they were not sure when they would come in.  5 minutes after we left I received a text that our bay was ready, what the heck?

Beware, you will also stand in line to even sign up for a bay. That took us about 30 minutes). As we were sitting after ordering our drinks and food at the bar, four servers came to the patio and started shutting everything down and made us feel like we weren't supposed to be there. No one ever brought us napkins, plates, or even asked if we were ok. Later in the day when we got to play the game, a family who was playing next to our bay left before their game time that they paid for ended, so they asked us to finish their play time. While hitting balls, a server came over to that bay and shut the game off on us.  We told him the family that just left asked us to finish the time they paid for.  He rolled his eyes and shrugged his shoulders as he said, \"you aren't making me any money, so I don't care\" as he was shutting down the bay. A manager did come over to apologize and he added that time onto our bay, but at that point, we were already turned off from the place. The game itself is amazing, too bad their staff isn't up to par. (Get it?). Such a shame. Hope they can step their game up and do better.",

    "text": "First off, I'll say that the concept of TopGolf itself is great. The games are very fun, the drinks were great, and we had a great time. The issue we had was with the wait times and being taken advantage of because of the long wait times. The pricing per hour is as follows: $25 before 12pm, $35 between 12pm-5pm, $45 between 5pm-close. My party showed up BEFORE 11am. Upon arrival, they made us pay for the first hour of golf. This was BEFORE 12pm so the price was $25. We proceeded to wait for over an hour. This put us in the bay at 12:15pm. When we arrived at the bay, the worker informed us that we would have to pay an additional $10 to play because we weren't at our bay before 12pm. I just feel like it's an extremely skeezy business practice to force your patrons to pay in advance for the time they've chosen to play, but then force them to pay MORE money because workers couldn't get you to a bay in time. I wouldn't be as mad if this place was actually at capacity, but at least a fourth of the bays weren't even occupied while we were there. I guess it makes sense not to open all of the bays, because the longer patrons have to wait, the more money they'll have to spend on food and drinks. It's clear that this business is a complete money-grab that's taking advantage of patrons that have had to wait an excruciatingly long time just to play. On top of this, while we waited for our turn to play, it took us 20+ minutes (after asking for a waiter to come to our table) to get someone from the wait staff to take our drink orders. Hopefully I'll return at some point, but there's no way I could recommend this place without having to list the bad that goes along with it.",

But, long waits, mediocre food and not the most pleasant of staff make it not something I would do unless friends talked me into it.  I am not an avid golfer anyhow.  Food is alright, but nothing special.  I dunno, I really like the concept and there is no competition, so I'm sure they'll do well.  And I'll certainly go back.",

Having lived in Atlanta and frequenting the locations there often, the Charlotte location still has a little of kinks to iron out.   If you plan to go on a weekend evening, and don't want to reserve a bay, you're better off putting your name on the list and going to grab a sit down dinner somewhere else to cover your 3 hour wait. My girlfriend actually went back first thing Sunday morning and there was still an extended wait. Maybe the people that never got in Saturday night camped out   Bartenders were hardworking and efficient",

    "text": "Overall our experience with Topgolf was okay. We left with the distinct feeling they were overstaffed because there were employees everywhere but our interactions with the employees were ineffective.   When we arrived there were three employees at the door greeting people. We walked in to two lines and a bar. We weren't sure if the people we were meeting had a bay reserved or not and we weren't aware that we need our own players cards to play. We awkwardly stood around for several minutes and not one of the staff members said anything to us. When our friends arrived they told us we had to get our own membership and we got to queue up in line to get a card. Then after getting the card we got to queue up again to get a bay. You have to provide your ID, email and phone number to purchase your $5 membership which seemed excessive to me to hit a couple golf balls.  While getting us set up at a bay the staff member told us we could split the cost. Great! Except then he said he would have to over charge the card since he couldn't split the cost to exactly half. I looked at the screen and pointed out the charge for half the $35 rental fee ($17.50). I wonder how often people are overcharged because of this.  After the initial set up we were finally able to play! I actually enjoying the driving range, not being a golf person I like that the machine kept score for me and the targets were fairly large. Our waitress only brought one set of silverware for our dinner and several napkins. Perhaps this was on purpose since only my salad needed a fork? However I have never been to a restaurant that only gave one person silverware.   Our group of 4 got in two solid round of golfing and dinner and drinks in the one hour we were there. While discussing our experience on the way home I found out they charged my boyfriend $16 for my $12 margarita which was annoying but not worth turning around and going back to fix. I will say the margarita was small even for $12 and my salad wasn't very big considering it was supposed to be an entree.   Would I go back? Yes if someone invited me but I am in no rush to return. If I do go back it would probably be for beers and golf not for a full meal.",

We came on a Friday night and there was a mix of people - families, dates, groups of friends, etc.   The guy who helped us at the front desk Paul was awesome and super helpful with setting us up since we'd never been before, and getting us into a bay area.  The lobby area is a little hectic with people waiting for bays... I didn't get a drink out here, but my friends did mention service was not as good in the lobby. But once you're in your area, your group has it's own space to sit/stand/hang out, and a server for drinks/food. Our server was helpful, checking back on us periodically!   We had a group of 6 people which I think is a good number to have in the bay playing at one time we played the normal/classic game. We played for 2 hours which at prime time (later in the evening) is $45/hour (they have variable pricing based on the time of day), which is why it's great to have a larger group to split the costs. In addition to the price of the bay, each player has to get a \"membership card\" which is a one-time $5 fee. This will track all of your stats which is the best part of playing if you're competitive like me!",

Our server was attentive and made sure my guest and I were taken care of.  There are poo tables and corn hole (I believe that's the name) and other little areas to just kick back and enjoy the social setting and of course there is the golfing areas as well.  I ordered the Mushi and a bottle of pinot grigio.  The wine was $29 and the mushi was a reasonable price as well. I would suggest going with a group of family/friends or date night! Definitely a go to!!!",

    "text": "Topgolf is a hole in one!  Opening weekend...who knows what we're walking into.  -Parked the car (parking might be quite difficult depending on day and time you're here)(There is also valet) -Waited in line to get a membership for $5 (45 minutes in the sun) -Waited in line to get a bay (Saturday evening...opening weekend)(20 minutes) -Escorted to our bay and given some instructions and advice (friendly and helpful) -Started whacking away as our server came and introduced himself -Ordered drinks...kept whacking -Extended our time to order more drinks and continue the whacking -Paid and left  What a great night! Sure...there will be kinks to work out of such a sizable and busy place. The place is an affordable date night, a fun place to come with friends or an interesting place to do some team building.  The golf range and games are incredibly fun. Even a novice will appreciate the simplicity of arriving with just themselves, finding clubs labeled to help them out, and games that are easy to understand. That horrible \"sorta\" swing will get better...I promise! You may have your neighbors trying to be friendly helpers though.  The service was as expected. They are busy. If you're the type of person that can't evaluate situational probabilities...don't write a review about how slow things are. If you didn't expect things to be a bit slower based on the parking lot and lines...maybe your expectations of divine intervention on the service is the problem.  There is music, television and wi-fi. There's a live DJ on the roof and it's essentially a night club later in the night. Be warned however, this place is loud at night! If you're looking to discuss business here...you might want to find somewhere a bit quieter.  My advice to Topgolf: More craft beer on tap...and a broader selection.  Topgolf is top notch!  Try: Coming here for date night  Avoid: Bringing the kids in the evening",

    "text": "This place is amazing!!!! Opening on June 9th, 2017 this will be the Charlotte area's new \"Go To Place.\"  The concept is simple, and brilliant. You come in, get a membership card (lifetime card costs $5) which you will use to pay for everything. You rent a bay and enjoy unlimited golf with your coworkers, friends or family while being waited on by friendly and fun staff members. The pricing model is simple - see my photos for current pricing at the time of the review. You pay for the bay, which can be split among members of your party if you wish. The bay is yours with unlimited balls for the duration you have it, and it includes your own two sets of clubs.  On the right (see photos) you will see clubs with Carolina Blue (GO HEELS!) inlay, those are women's flex. Those on the left are men's flex. They do not include gloves, so I suggest bringing your own as we did. You can also opt to bring your own clubs if you prefer.   Once at your bay, you set up your team (similar to the process at a bowling alley.) You can have up to 6 people per bay, and your bay has it's own private seating area and table, plus a dedicated TV you can control.  Each bay has a large outdoor heater, as well as a fan to help you stay comfortable. There are waiters who go around to get your food & drink orders. The food and drinks were fantastic! We tried everything from: * Jumbo shrimp with homemade cocktail sauce (not too spicy) with grated ginger & avocado * Mushi - Mexican sushi with a touch of Sriracha * Smoked Prime Rib * Charred broccolini * Deliciously soft roles and soft whipped butter (who doesn't love good bread & butter)? * Chopped Greek-style salad with pecans * Mini loaded potato wedges with ranch on the side * Fresh seared scallops * Donut holes with injectible fillings (raspberry jelly, chocolate, and Bavarian - don't be afraid to mix them up!)  I learned the hard way the donut injectors have caps that need screwed off. Take them off or you'll make a mess like I did! My favorite was mixing the rasberry with the creme. YUM!  The drink prices were reasonable and modest, and they have something for everyone. Should you have to wait for a bay (even though they have THREE levels of bays), you can grab a seat or a table at any level. (Again, see photos.)  There is abundant space to rent for meetings, conferences, weddings, banquets, birthdays, bachelor parties, etc. They can cater for whatever you need. They are also VERY sensitive to food allergies and unique dietary needs. Their cheeses were all pasteurized (for any fellow preggos out there), and they can accommodate allergies.  The overall vibe was friendly, fun and lighthearted. Great music flowed throughout, and at night when the targets are really glowing, the lights put on a show of sorts as they dance to the music.  When you're ready to golf, you simply grab your club, approach the mat and wave your ball over the large red dot in the top right of the target map (in front of your map). You'll know it worked because a green light will flash from the dispenser letting you know your micro-chipped ball is on its way. You can do this with your hand, or any club... The chip allows the system to keep your score and know which ball was yours. If you don't get it in a target, your score for that ball is 0. The further the target and closer to the center, the higher the score. Each \"game\" includes 20 balls. You get unlimited balls/games for the time you have the booth rented.   This was so much fun, and we can't wait to go back. It's conveniently located off 485 with ample parking. It's family friendly, could work for a work mixer, or as a quasi night-scene for drinks, dancing, food, and of course, golf.",

The food is also pretty good. The G.O.A.T and the injectable donut holes were my favorite menu items. The mac and cheese spring rolls, chicken and waffle sliders, buffalo chicken flatbread, and mushi were also very good. We enjoyed the Bloody Mary and Citrus Cabana as well.

True golfers already know it's more for entertainment and not \"real\" golf. I mean, it's not a driving range or golf course. You don't score points the same way as Tee Time.   It's great for golfers and non-golfers. However, the wait time is way too long! They estimated 4 hours for our group so we left, had fun somewhere else, then came back and still waited another hour! There has got to be a better estimating system. The staff were friendly. They recommend that we come in the morning when it's not busy.   Our waitress Vanessa was very nice. Food was good enough to eat. Drinks were decent as well. If you're looking for a fun place to enjoy with friends and family, or kids even, we feel that this Topgolf is a great addition to Charlotte. It's new right now, so it's super busy. Parking can be a pain too. So we will wait until it dies down to come back.",

You can go and golf, you can go and drink, or you can go and do both!   I went a couple weeks back with a group of about 12 guys the day before my wedding. We had to wait about an hour for a bay, but fortunately there is a full bar at your disposal while you wait.   If it is your first time, you have to buy a membership ($5) and anyone that wants to golf is required to have one as well. The wait at the bar for a drink can be extensive, but of course that is due to the high volume of people, not necessarily the quality of the service.  Once the novelty wears off and the crowds thin out, I'm looking forward to going back!",

Don't worry about being a good golfer - there are lots of games to choose from. You don't need to hit the ball far to win; just be consistent.

    "text": "I came for my birthday. Their  was a mix-up with credits on my membership account but was able to still let us play the bay .Overall it was a good experience.  Surprisingly it was packed on a Wednesday night like really packed. There was a 2 1/2 hour wait for a bay but we had planned on eating anyways so that wasn't an issue. The food and drink menu is varied and everyone was able to order to their liking. I will not I ordered a corona-rita and my waitress said they didn't have one which is weird.  Pros: Menu, music,staff, bay reservation alert via text Cons: Parking- I don't understand why more parking wasn't planned.  The process for getting your physical membership card in one line then getting in another to reserve a bay; process was not smooth and definitely needs to be improved especially when busy.   Tips: Definitely carpool or Uber if possible. go with the intention to eat so the possible 2-hour wait doesn't seem so shocking",

I went with a party of 4 and there was more than enough room on the bay. Although I mostly drank, ate and mingled while the others played, I was still entertained and engaged. The outside temperature was between 36-40 degrees and it was raining lightly during our 2 hour stay but Top Golf does a great job of regulating the temperature to keep guests comfortable even though wind gusts can bring a chill every now and then. Overall, I would recommend Top Golf for a great night out with friends. We will be back again when we come back home to Charlotte for Christmas.",

The wait for food and drinks was ridiculous. I understand they were somewhat busy but it was a Friday night and I think they should've been prepared for it. The actual golf experience would've have been much better without the unruly unsupervised children.Super disappointed.

Before we ordered we received our text saying our bay was ready so we walked away to wait. It took like 15 more minutes to get the text with our bay number. I just wish when you got the text saying \"it's ready-close out your bar tab\" it was actually time.   Once we got to our bay we were greeted and given directions. Even after directions it definitely helps if you go with someone whose been there before. It is fairly simple though! You have a server who can bring you food and drinks, a computer at your bay to choose your games and a tv to watch whatever you want. The seating is very comfortable and I love the couch setup.   It's really easy to keep adding time to your golfing so have a plan before you go in on how long you want to stay/ how much you want to pay",

Having a way to tell whether they are open or not would get them a 4 star from me.  Driving 20 minutes to find out whether they are open is not in my plan.  If they are open, the experience is really cool.  The concept is fantastic.  The game is fun for all skill levels and its a great place to just hang out.    Cocktails are weak and expensive, but the food is very good.    If I could tell whether or not they were open without driving to the facility, I would come here a lot.",

I was happy the wait wasn't long because the early evening crowd was exiting as we walked inside. While waiting for our booth, we decided have drinks downstairs. The floor on the ground level was very slippery, as if it was mopped with oily water. The waitress was very nice and we received our drinks pretty quickly.   We were told that we'd get 2 text messages before we were seated. The first text came through telling us to close any tabs and we would be seated soon. However, \"soon\" turned into 45-50 min. After finally receiving the second text, we went to our booth only to be turned around by the staff because they \"put us at another booth\". We waited.....again. I decided to go to the front to inquie about any problems. I was told our booth will be ready \"soon\". After being there for 2 hours, we decided to leave. If it wasn't for having a few drinks and the atmosphere, this would be a 1 star review due to service.",

We were checked in by a helpful employee who explained the concept, and quickly got to playing. Our group of 4 played for 1.5 hours (which was the right amount of time), and we had a great time.  Some things to know: -Wear anything - flip flops, heels, sneakers, etc. -Bring your own clubs or use theirs (for free) -Great way to spend time as a group of friends, couple, or family (if a family go earlier in the day as this place becomes a party scene as it gets later in the day) -You can eat and drink here - they have a variety of food though I've heard the food is just average -They have clean restrooms -Pricing is by the hour by the bay (up to 6 people per bay). -Prices escalate as the day goes on - I believe $25 an hour per bay until the noon, then $35 from noon to 4pm, and then $45 the rest of the day",

We asked her if the veggie burger was vegan and she said yes. I asked her to double check since she seemed unsure and she came back and let us know it had milk and eggs. That being said she was about to serve us the burger not being sure it was vegan and I personally am highly lactose intolerant. We ordered guacamole, fries and hummus and it took a very long time. I would go again but I would call ahead and make sure they have the burger and probably get a different server. I would hope that they properly inform their staff on allergens like this.",

I even had to shed some layers after we did a little \"speed\" round of hitting.  Menu was pretty extensive and our server kept checking on drinks and food.  I ended up getting the spinach salad (added chicken) and also order appetizers for the booth.  Chips and beer cheese were solid and the wings, though messy, were great as well.  Staff also gave us a run through of how the set-up works and safety about where to stand... I can see where it can get a little crazy with larger parties, but it was a fun outing and I was just happy I could hit the ball.",

We have so much fun with the different games because none of us can play golf if our lives depended on it. The drinks are good, the food is good. The only thing I would say is that with the set up of their service, I would order and eat inside or outside. The people that serve inside at the bar get ripped off in tips when people transfer their tab outside. I don't think that is fair since we did the majority of our ordering, eating inside. Once you get outside, make sure they give you silverware. I don't know why but they never seem to remember to give us silverware.",

    "text": "I am rating this place purely in the golfing because the food and drinks are bar options. It meets the standard. However, I don't understand why every time you go here they tell you it's a 2 hour wait. I have attempted to go here multiple times to see at least 10 bays open but a magical \"2 hour wait\" this is completely absurd. And none of the staff can answer why the bays are open. I've been to other Top Golfs and have never had this experience. Charlotte needs to get it together if I'm ever going to return to this location. Seems like a stupid ploy to get money from people at the bar. Once you actually get to golf the experience is fun. That's only if you'll sit around for 2 hours. I avisited at 4pm on a Friday, I'd hate to see what the wait was like during \"prime time\"",

Our waitress in the golf bay was very \"low-key\", almost like she was bored to death.  After our golf game, we went to the restaurant, and were pleased to see it wasn't crowded.  It took WAY too long for anyone to come over, and when someone did come we were told they would go get someone else.  WTW?  Guess who came to wait on us?  The same \"bored to death\" waitress we had previously.  On a scale of 1 - 10, her customer service skills are MAYBE a 1.  Thank you for helping us celebrate our son's Birthday!  You had more \"energy\" when you were chatting with your friends at another table.  So much so I had to go over and tap  her on the shoulder to let her know we were ready to pay.  Worst service ever, Andrea P.!",

Not only would we have to wait for membership but once we had membership we would have had to wait for an open bay, not a no wait situation. We went back around lunch time during the week and it was great. We had a great time and will definitely be back now that we don't have to wait for membership.

I guess I was expecting the same price range at this location but apparently each one is different. None the less of you're looking for a good date night just look forward to a pricey time. Being that the location I visited before was up north I was a little surprised with the cost of play and other things here in Charlotte ( I get it, you're paying for the experience but come on). Northern VA top golf charges by the game and you get a certain amount of balls with each game (great idea, doesn't keep you on a time limit and it's cost effective, you also don't mind spending more on other things). To keep in mind everyone will not travel in groups to a place like this, just like bowling etc. So the fees per hr to go to a \"driving range\" sounds a little excessive.   I hope as time goes on they will get a little a better. Not sure what audience they are trying to target but I'm currently not a fan of this particular location (just on pricing alone).",

    "text": "How cool is this place!!!  I was lucky enough to score an invite to the sneak peak event last night, and it was every bit as awesome as it looks online. If you want to know what this place is all about, visit their website and watch the 2 minute video as it provides a great orientation for what TopGolf is all about.   As an avid golfer, I was really looking forward to visiting this facility. I learned quickly this place is NOT just a place for golfers. It caters to players of all skill levels and ages. You don't even have to pick up a club to have an awesome outing at this place.   The Facilities: *Hole in One! The first thing that strikes you is the enormity of the complex - from the height of the nets, to the size of the building and parking lot. Inside everything is very clean and modern, from the seating, to the bar, the private rooms, and the bays themselves.   The Food and Drinks: *Birdie This place has the potential to be like Dave and Busters for grown-ups with better food. Here are the items I sampled:  Mini Potato Skins - *Albatross - By far the best executed of food items. I could eat these every day.  Mushie - A Strong Birdie - Could have used slightly less cilantro.  Seared Scallop - Birdie - Would have been an eagle with a little more aggressive seasoning. Lemon Butter Broccolini - Birdie - Very nice side dish with shaved garlic citrus infused butter. Vibrant and flavorful. Shrimp Cocktail - Par - Would have been a birdie if all of the shrimp had been fully cooked. The cocktail sauce with diced avocado was among the best I've had.  Tipsy Palmer - Bogey - I've had better John Daly's. This version fell flat, lacking enough lemon flavor. Would have also benefited from a splash of tonic or sprite.  Smoked Prime Rib - *Bogey - This sounded so promising, but unfortunately it was a miss. I'm guessing this was smoked at too high a temp for not long enough as the fat and collagen had not properly rendered into the meat which left it tough, chewy, and unpalatable.    The Equipment: *Par Each bay is equipped with male and female right handed clubs. Left handed clubs are available on request or you can also bring your own equipment. The irons had the look and feel of super game improvement Callaway clubs with with the TopGolf logos in place of regular branding. Each club had graphite shafts, the men's felt more stiff that a typical regular flex but not as firm as typical stiff shafts. The irons are more than adequate, but the woods seemed to be quite dated - the driver looking exactly like a mid-90s Big Bertha in size and design. Overall, the irons were easy to hit for players of any skill level, but the woods will present challenges to even some mid to low handicappers.   The Mats: *Bogey For me this was the most disappointing feature. For a brand new facility, I would have expected mats that had variable lie conditions - firm sections for fairway strikes, and softer longer cut turf to practice softer lies. Additionally, the tees were not adjustable. IMO, they were too high for iron shots, just right for the 3 wood, and too low for driver. They also lacked the ability to hold a standard tee as they we hollow inside. This will likely not bother a novice looking to have a good time, but golfers who join looking to use this as a practice supplement will be frustrated by these items.   The Games: *Eagle These were pretty cool. There is a wide variety of different games to choose from. Some are individual while some are team based. The traditional TopGolf game awards points for shots on target, with more points awarded the closer you come to the pin. Think darts with golf balls. Much like a bowling alley, you have a screen where you can type in player info, and select the game you wish to play. Players grab a club and head to the mat where they wave the club over a laser, which triggers a ball to be released. After each shot your score is tabulated and you can switch players by selecting them on the touch screen. There are also games for chipping, driving, and other skill challenges.     The Cost: *Par (but not one you feel good about) Bays are rented by the hour and the cost variable based on the time of day. All players are required to sign up for an initial one-time $5 membership. After that, Bay rentals are as follows: Open til Noon = $25 | Noon til 5 PM = $35 | 5 PM til Close = $45. This can be steep if you are playing solo, but if you are in a group of 6, it is much more palatable. The bay rental comes with unlimited balls during your time period.",

    "text": "We had a group of 6 people: upon arriving we were greeted and told to wait which is fine. We went to the bar and ordered some drinks while we waited. The beers were fine and so was the gin and tonic but the plain margarita tasted of salt water and had zero hint of tequila. When I told the waitress it was quite frankly disgusting she said \"okay\". The flavored ones my friends had ordered tasted fine. Once we sat down service was fun and relatively quick given how busy they were but after racking up a near 300$ tab we were enjoying the end of our chips and a good night when we were told to leave our table.  We politely left and sat at the bar where another waitress came up and asked us if we were \"ordering or hanging out\" and then walked away without saying anything when we said we didn't need anything else. All in all I'd say a good experience but the business gave me the sense of money hungry rather than entertainment minded. The mandatory 5$ membership is kinda dumb if you'll only go once, especially if you're from out of town and don't have one in your home town.",

The food is sneaky good, the atmosphere is excellent, staff is friendly, and that's before you even get into the golf. Whether you're a PGA pro or have never swung a club, you can have a great time here. They have multiple games and a ton of options for all skill levels. I took private lessons and highly recommend them. If in Charlotte, request Billy Belair, he's an insanely good golfer and even better instructor",

We only ordered an appetizer, and it was delivered right away and was good.   For us, it was pricy fun because it was just us - so no one to help split the hourly bay charges. And since we only had an hour to fit in the golf and snacking, it wasn't necessarily relaxing. However, if you go with another couple or with a few friends, you could easily spend a few hours and have time to play and eat and split the cost and it wouldn't be that expensive.",

I made a really great friend with the bartender. I believe her name is Kayla. She was so sweet and entertaining and really made a crummy night better. I hope next time I go she is there.

However, the good news is, you can reserve your spot well ahead of time and it really does make the process super easy.  The price, when split among a group of 6 or more for playing time is honestly VERY reasonable.  The food is pretty good as well.

We bought our membership cards online and put our name in without much hassle. We were quoted 2.5-3 hours but it ended up being less than 2. While we waited we went to the main floor bar. Service was difficult. After greeting us he took my husband's drink order and ran away without getting mine. One friend had to wait nearly an hour for a drink. We had to flag down the waiter to get napkins. The wait staff needs some practice and numerous addition servers, everyone looked frantic. The actual gameplay was really fun! I'm not a golf person and I had a great time. The service at the table was great. I'm so glad this place opened!",

This time we arrived earlier and the wait time was only 1.5 hours. Again we tried the restaurant, and was greeted after about 10 minutes after we sat down (self seating)The wait time for the bay was shorter than expected (40 minuets) we had to transfer our food to our bay. I truly enjoyed this visit, food was good, cocktails even better. My 6 year old really enjoyed himself and we plan on returning this weekend.  I would recommend as a good spot for kids but also a good date spot.",

Also, you have to pay $5 to become a lifetime member($4 if you pay through the app)? Why not just have to pay the range fee and that's it? The membership is almost completely worthless except you now can receive promotional emails and track your stats.

At least my backyard wings were !! Waitress was awesome! Super informative on menu and gave some awesome tips for our swing  My only problem was the annoying fans that kept blowing my hair everywhere and made my food cold.. also that 5$ fee for first timers was kinda a buzz kill but we had fun over all.   Also I recommend the Moscow mule",

    "text": "First time at TopGolf Charlotte! I've been to the first one in Alexandria, VA a million times so I figured this to be a better, upgraded version of TopGolf. It definitely was. Although I did have some initial trouble transferring over the funds of my Alexandria TopGolf card to my new Charlotte one, the staff was SUPER helpful and Jenn the manager took care of me to make it pain free! SHOUTOUT TO JENN.  Like I said, this location is pretty much a 'roided up version of the one I'm used to. There are three levels, updated bays that spit out golf balls when you wave your club over a light, and a ton of different games to play. The targets and turf we were hitting at you could also tell were in good shape and were KEPT in good shape.   My only criticism with the golfing experience was that sometimes it seemed like the screen would bounce it back and forth between players, making us hit each others balls (not a huge deal), and also there was no lighting past the bays when hitting. If you hit it out to the white target or back to the net, there was pretty much no way to see your ball unless you have hawk eyes.  I didn't get any food on my first visit, but the menu was pretty extensive. Both the drink and the food menu have a pretty nice variety! Some really tasty looking stuff that I'll have to try when I get back.  We all know what TopGolf is so if you're wondering if this is a good location, yes. Yes it is. It's relatively cheap and since they have 3 levels of bays, you can expect to not wait too long until you get to make fun of your friends for being horrible at golf. Fun had by all.",

It can get a little expensive - especially if you're having food or drinks - but you can usually find a coupon online for the games. The building is huge and every time I've been here it's been pretty crowded. When you get here there are usually a couple of employees there to greet you and guide you through the process.   The first I came here was in January - while they do have heaters my fiance and I were still pretty cold while playing. We ordered one of their coffee cocktails and it was pretty good and warmed us up a bit. We weren't very good so we just played the most basic game - but we had a lot of fun!   The second time I was here my fiance and I brought my dad for father's day. It was pretty warm out, but the fans kept us cool. We ordered the hummus to snack on and it was alright. Again - we just played the basic game - nothing fancy. But we had a great time! My dad loved it!   Top Golf is definitely something I won't do on a regular basis just because it can get expensive, but it's great for celebrations, groups, or a date night.",

It helps to sign up on the app for $4.. it is mandatory to sign up either in person or online.. and once you do.. you're a lifetime member. Pricing varies on time of day. $25/hr per bay up til noon and up to $45/hr at night time.. so split that between a group of up to 6 people and it's not too expensive.   My group of 4 stopped in on a Friday and had a short 15 minute wait for our bay in the 3rd flood. Everything runs smoothly here.. everything is tracked and scored for you.. even recorded in the app you signed up on.   Top golf offers food from breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.. all fairly priced. I tried the jalapeno cheese fries which were delicious.   Overall a great experience. It's kid and family friendly as well as a great date spot. Will definitely try top golf facilities in other parts of the country!",

What a perfect way to spend Mother's Day for me! We arrived early and I would advise you to do so on any given weekend day. It gets PACKED quickly.   Check in to get your card and assigned to a bay. We like being on upper levels for the better views.   In your bay, you can order from a pretty lengthy menu with lots of drink and food options. Today, we chose drinks and filled-doughnuts. Everything was great. I love that you have a server for your bay. Ours was extremely attentive!  Great family outing. A tad expensive but worth the hours of fun playing various games in our competitive family!   One tip: bring your own clubs if you have them. I think I would have enjoyed it a tad more using my own clubs for comfort.",

    "text": "I am not a golfer. Not even a mini golfer. But Topgolf sounded fun, so we decided to check it out recently. We went on a Sunday around 2 & there was a 30 minute wait for the 2nd or 3rd level - no wait for the first level. We put our names down and headed to the bar for a beer while we waited. Our bay was ready on time (they text you to let you know) and we met our bay host there. She helped us get set up and showed us how the game worked. You can choose from a bunch of different pre-set games, each game is 20 balls. We only wanted to play for an hour and were able to squeeze in 3 games (the last game we really rushed).   There were a lot of pro golfers, but plenty of non-golfers like us. Overall we had a lot of fun, but it's a little pricey for me to do very often. Hopefully they will start running promos once the buzz dies down!  Here are a couple of basics for people who haven't checked it out yet: * Each person needs a $5 lifetime membership (one-time cost) * The price is per hour - 6 people can play in a bay * The price differs by time: Open - Noon is $25, Noon - 5 is $35 and after 5 is $45 * You can make reservations online, but on the weekend the fee is $10 - $50 (looks like no fee for weekday reservs) * You have a server at your bay and they have a pretty big food and drink menu - we didn't try the food, but beer prices were pretty reasonable",

Like a driving range and a nightclub merged into one, it's a fun place to hang with friends, throw back a few drinks, and smash golf balls into the night.   But it's not really golf.   During a recent visit for a friend's birthday party, we were impressed both by the massive scale of the South Charlotte facility, as well as the personal service that made the experience less intimidating. The cocktail and beer selection was superb, and our golf bay clean, comfortable, and well-equipped. But the quality of our dinner buffet left a lot to be desired, and the computer scoring system (which is supposed to track how close your ball comes to one of the targets on the range) was frustratingly difficult to operate and understand. Most of our party started to lose interest in hitting balls off the mat after about an hour, at which point we could've had the same experience at a few dozen better clubs or restaurants.  The problem with TopGolf is that it isn't a great enough experience for skilled golfers, and doesn't give beginners a way to really try their hand at the game. It's just a place to mess around and hit balls with your buddies. There's nothing particularly wrong with that, but for my money, I'd rather spend an afternoon playing an actual round.",

In a nutshell, it's not horrible but if you're a golfer and just want to get some practice in, it may not be the best place for you.  The food is actually pretty good. Both quality and variety. Plenty of bar food to choose from but also lots of shareables like flat bread, nachos and wings. You can find plenty of healthier options including some decent salads. There's even a peculiar dessert of round fried batter balls that you can inject with raspberry, chocolate or cream. Kinda addictive! Lots of beer and drink options too. Not sure how swinging metal clubs around while mildly intoxicated has worked out for them but I imagine injuries occur here from time to time.  The prices are honestly a bit high to golf here. My office decided against an outing because of how expensive it is. I honestly think it was a good idea. Unless our office can fit into one bay (I think 6 people max) it's hard to really have a truly social outing here. And the individual prices per person are $25/hour on the off hours and go up from there. Even bowling, for example, is a whole lot cheaper around here. Or if you just gotta hear that \"thwack\" you can probably just go to a regular old driving range or a batting cage.",

We had to wait in line but that's to be expected for such a new spot with an innovative concept. It's worth the wait! After reserving two bays for a group of  11 guests and there was a 45 minute wait. We went upstairs and ordered drinks while sitting in the patio area. There was a DJ playing pretty good music and the drinks were reasonably priced so it made the time go by faster than expected. We made plans to order a meal before playing but our bays became available and we decided to hold off. Our waiter, Jeffrey, was AWESOME!! He explained everything to us and helped us get set up. He took our orders and made EXCELLENT recommendations for food choices. I ordered the backyard wings with fries and they were SUPERB! I can't say that I haven't considered going back just so I could order those wings to go. I like my wings extra crispy and would recommended asking them to be cooked a little longer but they were so yummy! The golfing experience wasn't as frustrating as I'd imagined because I was actually hitting the ball and scoring some points! I would tell everyone to try TopGolf!!! It's worth the wait and you won't regret it!",

    "text": "We came, we saw, we Topped some golfs from the mezzanine. My lovely bride and I stopped in for a quick visit: I used to play at all manner of golfs but she only ever did the windmill kind so we figured she could have a go at whacking the small ball in a low pressure environment while I tried to find my swing. The signing up part was irritating and slow and had to be re-done because the cashier managed to misspell my name while holding my credit card (I didn't make a huge scene but really, my name is right there on the card) We were escorted to the second floor and given the nickel tour of the hitting bay including club selection and how to choose games. I had topped some golfs in Austin when visiting my sister and had it mostly figured out but life is better when I don't have to try to remember anything but stand up and hit the ball (BTW: I'm pretty sure that the fields are reversed there-to-here and am also pretty sure it would matter if we were keeping score which we weren't but still...) Since we were just goofing around the scores and targets and aiming didn't mean much, my best girl got to come with and had some fun plus I got range time, sort of. Kinda spendy but it isn't like we're going to do this every night. We hit some golfs, we lit some lights. We smooched, we giggled! Yea us!",

    "text": "I have been anxiously waiting for TopGolf to open that I ended up going a few days before they officially opened. It's bowling meets golf. Since it was opening week, they were still working out kinks. Other than programming the right time of play everything was fine. We were on the very far right end which made it harder to target the bays that were to the left of me. The ones that were straight in front of me were really far. After our hour was up we ate food at our table and I felt like they were rushing us out. My only suggestion is that you pay per game. Golf isn't something you normally rush. And if people are eating and drinking in between than it's harder to enjoy the experience if there's a time limit. It's also a bit pricey if you go at night. The only good way to do TopGolf for cheaper is if you get more people to play. I believe the max is 6 per bay but you'll probably need 2 hours. Another complaint I have is they have a driver that you can use but you can't even use it because the tee doesn't adjust height at all. I wish they had the tees like they have at Leatherman that automatically tees the ball for you and you can adjust the height.  Came back again a month after opening and it seems they still don't have their kinks worked out. Some of the employees seem lost still. We were playing at our bay and a host asked if we were using it as we were swinging. Also, I told the guy when we first walked in that we had a $10 off coupon. Before we played noticed that they didn't apply it. Apparently you're supposed to wait in a different line if you have a coupon. Also we arrived with enough time to play before the rates went up but with the long waiting time we had to pay the higher hourly rate. There's nowhere to really wait unless you want to eat while you wait. The lobby is too full to wait in and the two pool tables were always in use. Luckily it wasn't busy in the dining area and the server graciously let us sit while we waited. It also would've been nice if the host that told us we had a long wait let us know that there's a place we could store our clubs. We noticed this room as we were looking for a place to wait and asked someone about it. Also, half of the parking lot was empty as it was reserved for valet parking. Cars were parked all along the driveway even though there were so many empty spots but you had to pay for those.",

Which made my last few experiences underwhelming  The concept is a great idea but waaaaay over commercialized.  Expensive food and drink for the quality and at $45 an hour for a bay after 5pm it just doesn't make much sense.    Fun idea, poorly executed.  You'll have more fun at a local driving range for half the price.   And no 2.5 hour wait!  Final note - parking is horrible here.  Not sure what the developers were thinking when they designed this place but hope they didn't get hired again",

Great concierge, food - quesadilla & wings were good and the price structure was on point. Plenty of parking including a valet option.   Only feedback I have for management is about the tall tables that are behind each couch. They need to bolted to the floor. We didn't realize the height of them and closeness to the couch. I sat down and hit my head pretty damn hard (headache worthy). Apparently the next table over did as well. Since the tables aren't taller than the average height of person sitting in front of it, causes easy issue. Until they fix it, just push it back into the isle, so its not a buzz kill.",

So I vouched to go on my Monday off and I arrived around 4. The price was $35 per hour between the hours 12-5pm which was cheaper than the typical $45. I had a HARD NIGHT before (too many Makers and ginger) so I go a sparkling water which was pretty tasty. Also if you can always request the 3rd floor which overlooks all the targets. Also my golf club of choice was \"The Wood\". Stayed for an hour and a half and really enjoyed myself. Happy Swinging",

Inside they have a fully stocked bar with all the regular spirits and a variety of local beers on tap.  I went with their \"Tipsy Palmer\" (obviously a stiff Arnold Palmer), which was perfect in the heat.  I was there for a soft open, so they rolled out a few apps for us.  The \"Mushi\" was my favorite. It had shredded chicken, mixed with sticky rice, avocado, cheese, sour cream, cilantro, beans, Sriracha in a jalapeno tortilla  wrap.  I also tried the cocktail shrimp, which was very solid!  For dessert, they brought out \"Injectable Donut Holes\"...yes, that's as good as it sounds!  You pick between 3 flavors: chocolate, raspberry jelly and my favorite, Bavarian Cream.  This is a must try!   Think of this place as one of the coolest bowling alleys you've been to....except for golf.  Perfect setup for 4-8 people (more if you double up cubes) to hit some balls, they have games you can play as a group, eat, drink, also plenty of Tv's for big sporting events.  My only concern for this place is that they will be to popular!",

    "text": "I went here on Sunday morning for my dad's birthday. They opened at 9, and my family (who has been here previously) told me to get here earlier because it will be super busy! So, when I arrived they had two lines; the first was if you already had a membership card and then second was if you needed a membership card. The card is only $5 and it last a lifetime. I paid for my card online the night before, so I only had to show them the email confirmation when I got to the register. Although the line for the membership was really long, maybe 30 minutes, I did not have to wait for a bay because my family was already waiting for me! The bag has a L-shape couch and a table to eat at as well as clubs for us to use (unless you are left-handed then they bring you clubs up). The floor was sticky... you can definitely hear it when you walked. When we sat down we began looking through the menu (because I was starving). I decided on the French toast! The picture looked amazing. The actually golfing is rather fun - even if you have never played before or in my case, suck at golf. I think my high score was around 48 points... anyways, my food has finally arrived! I felt like it took a while for it to come, and when it did we did not even have silverware. I took one bite, and was disgusted. The strawberries were great! The syrup was great! But the toast, was wayyyyy to burnt and hard! It was suppose to be fluffy, right? I had to send it back after only having one bite. I asked my family (we were in two bays) what they ordered before and if it was good - I didn't want to chance a bad meal again. I ended up ordering the buffalo chicken sliders (even though it was 10 AM). They arrived and looked delicious! It came with lettuce and tomato on the sliders, with a side of ranch for dipping. They weren't amazing, but I would probably order them again. Our server was eh, she didn't seem to check on us that often and when we wanted to order some drinks she never seemed to be around - we ended up starting a tab at the bar because we can never track her down. After about 2.5 hours I did not want to golf again, but I did want to stay to watch everyone play and enjoy the beautiful weather! A little after I stopped playing the ball dispenser stopped working! We grabbed a guy, he looked like a manager, and he walked over to our bay. We was very nice and was joking around with us! I cannot remember his name... but he added 30 minutes to our time because we had to wait. Then the screen went dead. Dead! We grabbed another gentleman, who looked like a manger as well. He told us the computer tech would be up in just a few minutes. It wasn't long and he was helping us! He basically had to reset the monitor and re-swiped the membership cards. Once he was done, he said he gave us a little bit more time. After playing about 20 minutes, we wanted to know how much time was left... when we checked he gave us 2 hours!! Overall, yes I would come here again. Do not expect the best waitress but their management staff is spectacular! And it is a bunch of fun!",

We were unable to make a reservation for a bay, but the website said they have several set aside for walk ins. We arrived about 11:30 (it's insanely easy to find), and proceeded to check in where we were told it would be a 2 hour wait. The hostess was kind, and explained the procedure. Basically she takes your name and phone number, and they send text updates. We spent a little bit of time hanging out there, and decided to go and grab lunch. As soon as we pulled into the parking lot (about 10 mins away), I received a text saying our bay was ready. I responded and it was ready for us to enter when we arrived back! That made out wait for a bay approximately 30 minutes (I had requested 2nd or 3rd floor). We played for an hour, and it was so much fun! They have clubs there to use, and a server to provide information, food and drinks. We didn't order food, only drinks. We can't wait to return!   FYI The one unexpected expense that we encountered was that everyone in the party is required to purchase a $5 membership. It is a one time purchase.",

I tried earlier in the day to reserve a bay but couldn't so we just went and waited for the first available one. It took 2.5 hours but truly we didn't even notice because we started with dinner and drinks and just kicking back in the downstairs lounge area. The pepperoni flatbread was pretty good but I think the crust could be better. The steak nachos were amazing. I mean that. They were sooo good. We also had the wing trio with mango habanero, teriyaki, and bbq. All of them were great. The white wine sangria was very light and we finished up with spiked lemonade. I thought the food was really good. Playing golf at night was fun and I enjoyed the bay. This is a place where you can take kids, go on a date, etc. Really cool spot.",

I was pleasantly surprised that Topgolf was much more than a driving range. There are a series of targets that you can earn points for hitting. There are short targets for those without much experience like myself as well as the long range targets for the experts. Topgolf also has a great food and drink menu. A server was constantly checking on us to see if we needed anything. I would highly recommend Topgolf for any type of group outing.",

There were still a good amount of people here but the vibe was pretty chill.   This review is strictly based on service.   My husband and I came in as walk ins. We walked to our... \"terminal\"? I don't know what these joints are called. A rep helped me (as a first timer) log in and like less than a min later Bethany (with the braces... in case there's another one with the same name) came thru with a smile asking us if we'd like any drinks or food. My husband and I just ordered drinks.   Around 5 min into our play time she checked on us. Everything was good.   Because I'm a newbie I \"injured\" myself so I had a little cut in my wrist. I asked her for a band aid and Bethany came out with three different ones. I only used one but she let me keep the other two. Their band aids are NICE. Like industrial grade bandages. These ain't Walmart or Target brand. These joints are like celebrity hospital grade. Okay enough about the band aids.   I like this place. It's a cute spot for a daytime chill. Imma have to check it out during rush time and see what they food talm bout.  Update: I decided to get the fish tacos. They were decent . $10 for tacos tho is a bit much... I had to take a star off for that. For $10 imma need them joints to be spectacular.",

It was cool to see the same vibe carried through here in Charlotte.  My friends and I reserved two bays for a 1:30pm Sunday afternoon. Unfortunately we still had to wait about 30 minutes after we got there (on time) because they didn't have any bays next to each other. A little strange since we made the reservation all in one, but this place is ALWAYS packed. It's worth it to pay ahead to have a reservation.  We were all starving so we ordered a couple of buckets of beer and some food. A friend and I split the Steak Tacos and Chicken and Waffles which was honestly the perfect amount of food. The steak was REALLY good and the waffles and chicken were flavorful and came out hot. I was very impressed with the speed of service given how huge and crowded the place was.   Great selection of drinks as well. Sure to be a favorite in Charlotte for a long time!",

I had some wings (I think they were called the backyard wings), they tasted great but went right through me quicker than a frat boy shotgunning a white claw (I hung out with my son a little to much this summer as you can tell LOL). So be mindful ordering them if you are on a date and don't want to embarrass yourself. The golf was fun though, we were on the bottom level so all my hits looked like putts and I couldn't get them too far. Next time I will try to get a spot on the top level.",

I've been to a handful of locations around the country and although still a good outing,  I typically have the least favorable experience here at the location in Charlotte. Even with that being saidz I yet to have a terrible experience here!  Usually I try to go during the week or first thing in the morning on a weekeend. Otherwise you can expect to wait for a few hours. Its not out of the question to get greated with a 2-4 hour wait on the weekends after lunch.   Our of the 5 or 6 times I've stuck around to play, I've had a good time. The service is all dependent upon how crazy things are but typically after 10 or 15 minutes in the bay someone comes to take our order.i have had one time where I had to seek out someone to take my order and another time where the waitress forgot to put our order in altogether.    Top Golf is great because even if you aren't a scratch golfer, you can squeeze out a solid score by just making contact with the ball.   Food wise I like their wings (pretty much every flavor) and the smokehouse burger. Their flatbreads/pizzas are also good for groups.    Summation,  if you go at a good time you'll have a blast. If you try to go when they are slammed its 50/50.",

I went with a group of friends on a Tuesday night, and it was half price bays (woo!). Otherwise, I think it's a little pricey for what you get. You only have an hour to play and then can extend your time in 30 minute increments. This can get pricey very fast if you go with a large group and if everyone wants to play because time runs out fast. We also had a reservation and it still took about 20 minutes to get our bay.  The actual facilities were really nice. The inside has a game area, a huge bar, lots of seating and TV's. The bays are equipped with clubs, touch screen game screens, TV's and heaters for the colder months. Our service was great and the food was actually pretty decent. Their bar has a large selection and the menu selection had variety as well.   There's not a ton of seating at each bay and they are close to other bays, so if there are two large groups, it can be tight. Parking on a Tuesday night was limited, so I can only imagine how it would be on a busy night. Overall, it was fun to experience but I wouldn't frequent TopGolf based on price.",

They have food, drinks, pool, video games, and more. It's located about 20 minutes outside Charlotte so a little bit of a drive and there's not too much else going on right by it.   The Topgolf facility is top notch and well thought out. They are constantly busy but there is still plenty of seating room and TVs to watch. During the weekends expect there to be hefty wait if you want a good spot on the 2nd or 3rd deck.   You can reserve a spot and sometime it can cost a little bit extra to do so, so be prepared for that. As far as the driving range goes they have a lot more than your typical range. They have clubs already and you can also bring your own if you choose. Both left and right handed. You pay by the hour and balls are dispensed as you need from your machine. They have different games to play between your friends or you can just swing for practice. Plenty of options and that's what Topgolf has waiting for you!",

We were planning several months in advance locking down guest lists and dinner reservations. Upon speaking with Topgolf, fees were estimated at $44-47 per person, plus additional charges for the REQUIRED catered package. We were looking at a quote around $1,000 for two hours for a group of 16 people. Since we have dinner reservations and they advertises $47 per hour on the weeks for a bay, the $1,000 dollar quote is astonishing.   If all you need is one bay Topgolf is a great place to have some fun! More than one bay, I highly recommend you look elsewhere so you don't break the bank as it is straight highway robbery.",

There's several different game options to choose from here. This location has more than 100 bays. They are all climate controlled and have TVs. They also have a full service restaurant and bars. Your bay has a server, so you never have to leave to get anything. You can order from them (and for the love of god, please tip your server).  This place does get really packed and you can expect a wait, especially on the weekends. There is an option to reserve a bay online that allows you to skip the line. Note: there may be an extra fee for that. You can also plan and book events.   Currently, there's a promotion for half-price game play on Tuesdays and also unlimited game play on Mondays-Fridays from 9am-noon for $15 per person. I'm not sure how long either of these will last, so just always make sure to check the website ahead of time to see what kind of deals, promos, coupons are happening. Just click on the promotions tab (and make sure you're looking at the Charlotte location).",

    "text": "Nasty rude servers!! Server mixed up the bills and got frazzled when I asked her to explain certain charges. She said and I quote \"That's why large groups shouldn't do separate orders\"...She also said \"If you didn't come to pay then don't play.\"  Really!!! We had a large group but when you work with the public don't snap on customers when you are asked to explain and to separate the bills. Also, some of the food never arrived for our other group of family and friend until they were ready to leave (2 hrs later)! Reported incident to a manager, he apologized fir the situation and offered me a reservation pass for my next . He asked me to wait there because he'd be right back with the pass.   Unfortunately, he didn't come back at all. Damn that's the second strike against them. I decided to talk with another manager who in return decked to offer both parties reservation  passes. He returned promptly with the passes. I'm not certain if I'l ever go back there to use the pass. First time was awful and I don't want to patronize a business with poor customer service and rude servers!!",

    "text": "Since it is new in Charlotte the wait time is still crazy long! On a Saturday that I went with a group of 5, we had to wait almost 2 hrs for a bay. So while we waited we wanted to get some food and drinks. The service was very chaotic in the bar area and it was hard to get our server's attention most of the time. Seating wise there were not a lot of sections in the bar area for more than 4. I think if they anticipated Topgolf to be so popular they might have wanted to make 2 bar areas. I still enjoy my time every time I go to Topgolf. The front desk staff are always very helpful to keep me updated on our wait time.",

My friends and I ordered cheese fries and pretzel dippers while waiting for a bay. Both were good.  The three stars really is because of the drinks. I ordered a pineapple punch and my friend ordered a citrus cabana. The menu says they are sized for 2+ people each, yet there was little to no alcohol in the drink. My friend confirmed that there was almost no alcohol in hers either. You do get the souvenir light up cup that it comes in, but at $16 a pop I was disappointed. I would come back to Topgolf but skip the drinks.",

Manager said \"you are acting out of the ordinary so we don't know what you did before this.\" I was at school from 8 am till I came. We spent $50 for the reservation and another absurd amount on our food and then were cut off bc they did not want to serve us and  had gotten all the money they wanted out of us. Terrible service. Terrible management. Do not go. I hope our waitress and manager get fired because of how rude they were. I love all people and always have a great time so this was disgusting and shocking to me.

    "text": "I am in town for the weekend from Raleigh for Scarowinds. I wanted to have a beer and food afterwards and we do not have a TopGolf in Raleigh nor have ever been to one. I arrived at 1:20 am on 10/29 and they close at 2am. I didn't know how playing worked and thought maybe I could buy a small bucket of balls and enjoy myself for at least 30 minutes.   When I arrived the greeters were very nice at the concierge/ reception counter and were very helping and directed me to the membership counter. A quick glance at the screen and I realized that this is not how TopGolf works and I don't have enough time to sign up and play. I then headed straight to the bar and took a seat. We were greeted fairly promptly. I asked for a food menu and the bartender told me that the kitchen was closed. I then asked what time does the kitchen close and he said 1:30. I then looked at my cell phone(world wide time clock) and it said it was 1:25am on the dot. He then called for backup to get someone else to tell us we couldn't eat basically. I was annoyed as I looked across the bar and saw people devouring their food that was delivered as I sat. Another bar tender then took over in assisting us and gave us menus and basically hovered over us and really putting on the pressure to order ASAP. We order the nachos and they were delicious but our bartender never asked us how was our meal, they never gave me side plates or napkins. Another individual who was taking out trash saw us eating and in concern asked if we needed napkins or anything else.  Basically, if you are going to advertise that you close at 2am then your employees should treat your customers like paying guest until 2am. Not like we are imposing on the servers or bartenders because all they are focused on is cleaning and closing everything down. Customer service completely was not their focus, which wasn't a good first impression at all.",

    "text": "The golf portion of this place is fun and the only aspect that brings people back.   The rest of your experience at Top Golf will have you looking for the exit and other options.   Wait times are long, service is slow, customer service is entirely absent.   Been here a few times and it's always the same. Last night we had a group of 8, ordering drinks/apps/desserts, all while in our 1st hour of play when all of a sudden our waitress (who wasn't even sure how to ring in my beer or if they even had it when I could see the tap handle from where we were) comes up and informs us that our time is up and we need to clear out or pay for another hour. At this point we still don't even have our nachos which we ordered at the start of the hour. We tell her we are still waiting on food and she says ok and goes to talk to who I assume is a floor manager of sorts. When she walks away we see that we still have more than 12 minutes left on our first hour. We decide not to do another hour (they were out of the dessert we wanted, the food was taking forever (on a cold Monday night in March) and the service was lacking to put it nicely) and the server and manager immediately start to try and clear our table. We tell them that we still don't have all our food, which we have already paid for at this point (and the bills were wrong, so wrong we didn't even say anything because it would have taken another 20 minutes for them to try and wrap their heads around that brain teaser) and they kind of leave us alone for a bit. This whole time is still within our hour of gameplay as the clock is still ticking down on the computer screen...  Our second choice of dessert finally comes out (s'mores cookies, basically some chips ahoy soft bake cookies sandwiching a marshmallow and drizzled with Hershey's chocolate sauce, not worth the money or the 30 minute wait time, not even sure how that's possible) and they immediately start to buss the table again. They make me and my girlfriend feel completely unwelcome as they whirl around us trying to clean up her beer which wasn't empty and the dessert plates on the table which we just received.   Everyone in our group is in the service industry (cooks and servers) so we know the deal. The level of service and quality of most of the food at Topgolf is on par with fast food restaurants, which is kind of an insult to Chik-fil-a.  Go for the golf if you go at all.",

He asked \"You got everything figured out?!\" and I asked him what figured out? He said, \"I don't know but we need you guys out cause we have another group coming\" (as the other people sat) We asked for a box for our food that we ordered and they couldn't waste time so that all got thrown away.

I went with a group of people from work on a bit of a \"Team Building\" exercise and so we had a booth rented out for the night and so certainly we wanted service and to have a good time and that means we were there to spend some money which of course is the reason they built this place. Now please know I am super forgiving to slow service at a small place that's packed, understaffed and when people are visible trying and efficient but that is not the case here, this place has tons of staff, they are just slow AF. I mean like actually slooooow, like they move really slow, I saw maybe 2 staff out of about 50 that had the body language, speed and attitude of professional high volume F&B people. At the main bar they had 3 bartenders and one was great, the other 2 would barley qualify to be cashiers at Taco Bell. Another example is when we ordered our 2nd round of apps the person brought them out, we had to move the empty baskets on to our seats, she unloaded her tray and started to walk away and I said (nicely) \"oh hey let me hand these too you\" the response from her was just a shrug and the slowest movement possible, in and of itself not a huge deal but just a total miss for a place that was obviously highly planed to be a high volume place offering a fun vibe. Honestly I could give the place 4 stars because overall we had a good experience but they did so well in conceiving and build this place to then staff it with C-Team talent I just could not give 4 stars much less 5. If anyone from this company reads this review I'm telling you you obviously know you have a gold mine and even with everything I said here there was a line out the door for the place but instead of staying longer and spending even more money (and for our group money was no object) we decided just to go elsewhere because the service was so lame, oh yeah and the scotch options were weak, basically a cool place but could really use some high-end options and then guess what, you would make even more money!!!",

While waiting for our bay, we went to the third level bar and ordered drinks. First off there were only 2 bartenders for a very crowded bar area. Took 20 minutes to get poorly made drinks and we watched as food sat on the bar for 15 minutes as no one knew which table it went to. Once at our bay, it was apparent the communication in this place between employees was horrible. We were told they were out of straws and limes, we personally walked to another floor and found both these items on the other floor from the bar.... come on. Then our food came our wrong and at different increments. I was completely done with my food by the time my side of fries even came to the table which I had to remind our server about 3 times. Not once did a manager stop over to check in, nor did the server try to get anything done to make up for the errors and slow delivery times. I work in the hospitality industry and this is just unacceptable. I know things like this happen but it's all about how you recover by going above and beyond to make the situation better, and a simple I'm sorry goes a long way too. Tip to management, train your staff better and be more present in the evening. We will be back hoping the kinks get worked out.",

    "text": "The golf part was seriously lots of fun- our family all had a great time playing, but we waited close to an hour (literally) for our burgers that had hard buns like they had been sitting under a warmer for a long time; they really were pretty bad and everyone in our group's stomachs aren't feeling that great right now as I write this; everyone is very disappointed with that part. I had to ask our waitress 3 times to check on our food, and the 3rd time went to go find her and her manager was with her; he said he would check on our order (but didn't even apologize). It would've been nice if she took the situation in mind and (like most places that make that kind of mistake) offered to remove at least one of the burgers off our check, but she didn't. However, I will say the appetizers were good. Guacamole was outstanding - I mean really good. Overall, we had a good time, but it was SUPER expensive. Plan to bring your Platinum card. (The bill for 2 appetizers, 4 burgers, 1 turkey wrap, a couple sodas, and 7 adult drinks came out to $180- and that wasn't including the $45/hr golf bay rental, and we were there for 2-1/2hrs. So $300  overall (for 5 people)-- yikes! Expensive night!",

Then as we tried to check in the people managing the line told other people to jump in front of me checking in. When we came back from waiting 3 hours we tried to order drinks and nobody at the bar would aknowledge us. I don't know if there's take this way all the time I guess it's because it's new but the staff did say it's been a minimum of a 2 hour wait since opening. I found it very poor service and management overall.",

    "text": "I've never been to a Top Golf before, so I don't have much to compare it to but... This place was completely understaffed. Especially it being a holiday. My sister and I arrived with our parents today and waited in line to get Top Golf cards, which you need to have. Understandable. Then we went to the dining area to get food drinks since it was an hour wait for the bay. No one came over to us for at least ten minutes, so my sister and I ordered drinks at the bar. While we waited for our drinks to be made we asked if we had a server because my family was very hungry and thirsty. We were told that we should have one but that they were swamped so the bartender said she would  come over to take our food order. We sat down and a few minutes later the waitress came over and took food orders. We forgot to ask for water for our parents, but usually that is just brought to the table. Since it wasn't, we went to the bar again and waited for waters. We continued to wait for our food and were finally offered comped chips and salsa for waiting, since the server said they came out right away. Our bay was finally ready, so we headed up and told the server to transfer our food bill to our bay. We get to out bay and go over all the precautions and sign the waivers with our cards. Our food finally arrives with no utensils and no dressing on the salad...and there are no balls. Oh, and the chips and salsa never came either. Fine. They move us to the next bay and we had to ask the server upstairs for silverware.  We did not care about the salad dressing by then. Finally we think we are about ready to start, and guess what.....the balls aren't coming out. The technician comes over to fix the ball situation and we are able to start hitting balls and we had a great time.   We are ready to leave and ask for the check and it comes out with chips and guacamole on the bill but we never even ordered the chips and guacamole. Was that supposed to be our comped chips and salsa that they were now charging us for? Overall, the golf experience was good, but the food or service was not.",

    "text": "Top golf is very fun, food was okay, service was slow but they were really busy so that was expected(opening weekend) One star is for the valet company they use! After a night of fun, valet retrieved my car. Right when we saw my car I, the owner of the car, my boyfriend and my dad all saw a dent in my driver side door that was not there. It was like it was opened on a pole or something. We notified valet and conveniently my car was parked right next to the owners \"brand new car with nothing wrong on it\". Owner said he would look at the video (on the 11th) and reach back out but the end of the day. After no update I finally reached out on the 14th for one. Said he would be sending a email, which he did and of course in it it was stated that after review of the video they didn't see anything. He also said he would call(never did). On the 16th I said that I would need to see the video because how do I know they are telling the truth without me seeing it? He asked what would be a good day and I told him.  He the asked if I was available for a call that day, I said yes. Guess what? No call. A few days later was told I can't see the video blah blah blah FIGURES. Then the owner said \"I don't mind helping a bit in good faith\".  Good faith lol. I don't even care at the point after countless promised phone calls, really no updates, and them just saying they didn't do anything but I can't see the video so how do I know?? I don't need someone \"helping me a bit in good faith\". I've just learned my lesson about valet.",

    "text": "Best Friday afternoon work outing EVER. I was lucky enough to visit Topgolf on a Friday afternoon this week with some coworkers, and we had such a great time!   The taco buffet we had for lunch was really tasty - I highly recommend this menu choice for others looking to have a dining experience with a larger group (we had around 25 people altogether). We had plenty of food (chicken and beef, soft taco shells, rice, beans, chips and salsa, non-alcoholic bevvies), and everything was really flavorful, which to me is impressive given that most people probably don't come to Topgolf solely to chow down.   I can see why this place gets so crowded -- like previous reviewers have mentioned, it feels like going to a bowling alley, but... you're golfing (or attempting to, in my case!). It's a great atmosphere to come with a group for a special occasion.   Every staff member we met was very friendly and helpful - very much appreciate this as we were all first-timers.   Looking forward to my next visit!",

One thing I thought was weird was that I couldn't find the prices online per hour before arriving. The price basically gets higher the later in the day you go from $25-$45. Great for big groups (you can split the hourly price), but if I were to go with a big group again I would definitely suggest more than an hour. Went with a group of 6 and only hit about 3 times in that hour because they recommend you hit 5 balls at a time. Going with one other person allows you to hit a lot! The time that was not so great was on a weekday at about 4pm. They said the wait would be about 20mins and turned into about an hour, because they had bigger groups to accommodate that they were waiting to arrive first. Didn't feel important or that they updated us on the extended wait time enough. Luckily we could sit at the bar or we would have left.",

    "text": "Topgolf is the place to have fun while hanging out with friends.  Upon arrival on a Saturday night, cars were parked on the side street.  I was fortunate to find a space there when a car pulled out.  After walking around to the front of the building, I saw there was a very long line of patrons waiting to get in.  A staff member who came around to answer questions of the patrons in line mentioned the line was to get a membership card, which is needed to participate.  If you already had a card, you could go ahead and get your name on the waiting list for a pod.  There were three registers open but it was taking a really long time to get individuals registered.  After getting to the front of the line (via friends in our party), our pre-reserved pod was ready.  It happened to be the one right in front of the lobby area.  No big deal as the music was so loud, nothing in the lobby got our attention.  The place was wild.    There was one staff member, let's call her a guide, who came around to show us how to operate the computer, etc.  She said our waitress would be along shortly.  After a long while, I grabbed her to get the waitress and send her to our table.  Our table should have had six chairs but the pod people next to us took three of them for their party.  I had to convince the guide to get our chairs.  She couldn't do it and had to grab a manager.  He came by and got us three chairs from somewhere.    Did I mention the music was really loud?  You had to yell at each other to conversate.  We finally got drinks and food.  The food is pretty good and the prices are reasonable.  I thought the price for the play time ($45/hour for the pod) was high but I don't know much about paying to play golf.  It was a lot of fun but I could have done without the really loud music.  Maybe it's not as loud on the higher levels.   They also have a bar/restaurant area, and a DJ was upstairs playing in front of the dance floor.  If you want to hang out on a weekend night, this is a great place.  If you are serious about hitting golf balls, you definitely want to visit on a weeknight.  It's a great place for kids any day but the weekends are a bit much for the young ones.",

Each time it is the same thing... the kiosks at each bay are excruciatingly slow  and often make errors.  Then, you stand there waiting for the 0 to change to the correct score and the \"meter\" keeps running.  Top Golf is like being in a cab in a busy city with lots of lights that are red.  The seating is awkward - unless you get one of the couch bays.  The rectangular tables might be better served if they were turned 90 degrees.  As to the food, it's average pub food.  The wings which we ordered each of the first 2 visits, came out mushy and just seemed undercooked.  The brisket - which was served at the event - was the fattiest brisket I have ever had.    And to boot, the place is really expensive when you add everything up.  On a positive, good beer selection, and the wait staff is mostly friendly.  The folks at the front desk area could use a lesson in warmth.",

Playing the actual game is really fun (and not just because I'm actually pretty good) but it's just the whole experience especially with the right group of people. There is usually a pretty long wait time so now that you can make reservations online that would be your best bet. But they do charge for the most popular days/ night like Friday & Saturday's, but it's pretty busy during the week as well. The service has been pretty good with not too many complaints. And the food is delicious! I've tried just about everything and my favs are the signature nachos and the grilled backyard wings, the chicken sandwich is also on point! And yes I've been here just to eat before lol. The drinks are good as well but the golfbags could be a little stronger even though you need two people to even order it.",

Scratch that, I am basically N/A at golf because, besides the lovely game of putt putt, I have never even swung a golf club. Fast forward to end of review..... I had so much fun at Topgolf!  My husband and I came over his lunch break one Monday that I had off of work. The setup was super impressive and the inside is very nice looking. His company is a Platinum card holder so we got the royal treatment (ie. didnt have to wait in any lines and got fancy golf clubs). At first, I was barely getting the ball off the tee. However, at the end, I was hitting the targets like crazy! We played for a bout an hour and a half. Since the Platinum card comes with Topgolf games for free, it was nice not to have to worry about timing of how long we were playing.   The waitresses stopped by regularly and we ordered pulled pork sliders and chips/salsa/guac. The sliders were delicious and the guac was nicely made.   Overall, I am a huge Topgolf fan after this experience. It was a fantastic way to spend my Monday afternoon and we will definitely be back!",

However, I have to admit the drinks are very pricey. The food is delicious. No they are not large portions, but its really nice to graze while you play! Definitely make sure to try the steak nachos. They are amazing! Our last experience was less than spectacular. We were celebrating our parents anniversary. At first when we arrived we requested a lounge, were told this request could be accommodated and then when we walked up the stairs to the third floor, found that we had been placed at a high top. We had a small child with us, so we had to ask that we were moved to a lounge. The hostess insisted that I had to go back downstairs with her to be moved. However, when we went back downstairs, it turned out I was not needed. Then when we arrived at the lounge, we asked for right handed children's clubs and a set of left handed adult clubs. The host arrived with left handed children's clubs and the adult clubs were left handed however there were only 3 clubs in the bag! The children's clubs were corrected but only after quite some time but we never did get a full set of left handed clubs. Next, our server came to set us up to play. She was extremely rude to us. When we asked what the price of a certain drink was she said \"well the menu is in front of you, isnt it.\" We explained that it did not have the price and she said, \"well I dont know how much it is, probably no more than $15.\" Two players had lieftime memberships but forgot their cards and we asked if we could just pay the $1 replacement fee as we had before instead of the $5 for a whole new membership. She said they have never done that, which was strange since we had done that before. She seemed very frustrated and upset in general. We tried to order appetizers from her and she said \"wait, Hold on.\" and just left without taking the order! 5 minutes later, another server came up and explained there was a shift change and she would be taking care of us. She was very nice and we had a pleasant time after that.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I love to come to Topgolf anytime we visit Charlotte. He is an avid golfer.. I have been golfing less than 10 times in my life. We both always have a blast.   Topgolf is basically a driving range with certain targets to aim for. The golf balls have gps, so a computer in your bay tracks where you land. There are several options of games to play that you select on said computer. There are several clubs to chose from in each bay. The bays also have heaters that do a good job of keeping the seating area warm when it is cold out. Each bay also has a table, chairs, and a server for drinks and food.  While visiting this morning we ordered a few mimosas and beers, and our server was quick in bringing them out. We definitely want to try one of the \"Golfbag\" drinks if we're ever back in the evening.  It can be pricey but the prices increase later in the day, so you can plan a visit early in the day to save money. We went around 10 a.m. this morning and it was still decently busy. It was $25/bay/hour until noon. You can have up to 6 people in a bay, so you can come with friends to make it more affordable.  Overall, a very fun experience for any group. We will continue to visit!",

You pay for the bay by the hour and it's hard to judge how long you will need to finish a game especially for your first time. But you always have the option to extend it which is nice.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars are that the food options were limited and the alcohol drinks were very much watered down and not worth the prices.  My suggestion, eat after and just enjoy the game while you're there!",

I had never been to something quite like this place before, however I enjoyed it. It was very lively and very self explanatory. The staff was friendly as well as helpful. If you go to Topgolf though I wouldn't order the food unless your starving. The food was subpar. We got the bbq sliders,wing trio, salsa and chips ( which we got guacamole with and Queso) the queso was oily and the chips were the kind you receive at the movie theater. The wings on the other hand weren't bad just wasn't crazy about the sauces. Other than the food just being okay, we had a great time. Playing golf in it's self with your friends and family especially when some aren't the greatest was enjoyable. Next time I honestly just won't order the food next time and just get drinks.",

Definitely rubbed or brined overnight. The GOAT sandwich was good. Service was slow in the beginning. We were upstairs in the outdoor seating area and waited about 20 minutes with no wait staff.  We eventually gave our order to the bartenders at the outdoor bar. Food came out quick after that. Splitting the bill wasn't a big deal which was good.   We got there around 12:30 and was told the wait was 2.5 hours. There were 5 of us total so wr got drinks and food in thr meantime. They had giant bucket beerpong and other games scattered throughout the building, like foosball, pool tables, shuffleboard, etc... around the 2 hr mark i went to check up on our time and they said they could get us a bay. Service was great from there on forward. It was most of our first time playing the top golf games and it was a lot of fun. It wasnt expensive, time went by quick. Definitely a great way to spend a beautiful saturday.",

We used Topgolf as an event at the close of a corporate meeting and used the private event services.   I really liked how we had our host waiting for us in the lobby to take us to our private area along with dedicated servers.  We selected the backyard bbq menu and it didn't disappoint.  Everyone seemed really into the chicken ( as a veggisaurus I'll take their word for it) and I can tell you I think the mac and cheese was pretty good.   I'll be honest, I didn't fully understand the point system other than the concept of \"get your ball into one of the giant holes in the ground\" for points.  Apparently I was pretty good at it as I beat everyone else in the bay I was on.  I'm more of a mini golf person, so this was shocking to me as well as the people that are way more into golf than I am.  In terms of private parties, this location was great to work with and made for a great way to end a business event.",

    "text": "Ok so here's a few quick things about me: -I am super competitive -I love food -I love booze -I am AWFUL at golf, but I have the heart of a champion  So Topgolf incorporates all of those things which makes me LOVE it. The food isn't just bar food, but they have unique bites such as a donut holes that you can stuff with gooey chocolate, or charcuterie board that's a giant pretzel stuffed with all the meats and cheeses. I'm a BIG fan of the backyard baked wings,the burgers, and their new spring meatballs.   Anyone can play topgolf. You do not have to be good. You just have to try to get it into their targets. We've gone with some amazing golfers, but they cannot hit a target for the life of them. The driving range is heated, so when we went for New Year's Eve it still had the heat blowing to keep us warm. As someone who is always cold, I love that feature.  The only call out I would suggest is helping some of the wait staff. My husband and I are in a couples league at TG and we come every Monday. We grab our dinner while we're playing. Out of the six weeks we have went, two times my drink was wrong, three times my food was brought cold, and the majority of the 6 times in all the staff were MIA or bored out of their minds leaning on the wall.   Don't get me wrong, that's not going to harsh my competitive vibe. But it will def harsh me ordering more cocktails and/or enjoying the delicious snacks...which can be good or bad for me (depending on the Monday).  Pro Tip-Try to get the second or third floor bays",

    "text": "Was so stoked when I found out this place was coming to Charlotte. Even if you are not a golfer this place is where it's at for a fun time. As soon as I walked through the door I was like a kid at Disneyworld.   I started the evening at the bar for a drink as we waited for the rest of our party to arrive.  I will say that this place is always packed so be prepared to wait before you are able to enter the bay. If they build the new location in north Charlotte, I think that will help with the wait times. My recommendation until that happens would be to get the VIP pass so you can make a reservation. Hey, I am not complaining about the wait tho when you can have a drink at a bar. They also serve food here which I have not tried yet but hear it is pretty good.  Maybe next visit I will try some food.  Once we got in the golf bay on the upper deck ( they have a few levels) let the games begin. So many different games to play and for all skill levels.  The net is not too deep at 215 feet and the targets are fairly large. The  scoring is done by micro chip balls when they land in targets and the closer to the flag in the middle the more points. Those are the basic rules but don't worry because a friendly staff member will set you up when you arrive to the bay. They will explain and answer any questions. I noticed some would bring their entire set of golf clubs but I find that is a little aggressive perhaps. Personally I think the clubs they provide in the stations for both men and women are decent. They are graphite shafts and I prefer stiff flex steel shafts so next visit I will probable bring a couple clubs of my own.   In case you can't tell, this place is awesome and will be back. I have been twice now but will tell you up front it is a little pricey but worth it. Best bet is get a group and split the cost of the bay rental. It is like 45 bucks for a hour after 5 and 25 before noon. 35 I think from the hours of 12-5. Then you get food and drinks and that is an expensive outing.   Going during the day at cheaper rate is more my speed anyways as it gets really loud at night with the music and crowd. Almost feels like a club. Also, come here for the fun and not necessarily to work on your golf game- go to the range for that.",

    "text": "Such a great addition to the Charlotte area!  When I think of a driving range, I think of a slightly dingy place where you bring a couple of clubs, grab a basket of balls, and hit about an hours worth of shots off an open tee.  This is definitely NOT this place.  Top Golf is really best for groups, especially non-golfers.  They have a full set of both Women's and Men's clubs, so you don't have to bring your own if you don't want to.  I would say the more competitive groups had their own clubs, and the ones just playing for fun did not.  We were there for my boyfriend's birthday, so we had a group of all skill levels.  We chose to play the game where you just try to hit as close to the center of the target as possible (the further you hit it, and the closer to the center of the target you get, the more points they give you).  Great because you can score a lot of points hitting the center of a close target for those of us who are terrible at golf!  They also have regular games, scrambles, etc.  Something for everyone!  Form what I understand, all of the balls have RFID so it will show you where your ball landed on a screen.  I just need to knock this place for the food service.  It took almost TWO HOURS to get food, and we had to extend our time an extra hour (which they felt bad about us doing), but they were great in their response on fixing the situation.  Our waitress was certainly available when we needed her, and hopefully next time I go, the food will come out quicker.  Just a warning, it gets windy on the third level (where I was playing), so hold onto your drinks!  Overall, I had a fantastic time and I highly recommend this place if you go early.  We waited an hour on a Monday night, which was just enough time to hang out and have a drink at the bar.  I have to say my favorite part of the night was when it got dark, the targets on the range lit up, and flickered to the beat of the techno music.  Fun time and I'll be back!!!",

    "text": "Decided to go check this place out for my Birthday with my Husband.  They recently opened this location in Charlotte so I expected it to be busy.  There was a fair amount of people there for a Tuesday afternoon.  If you don't already have a membership then you have to wait in line and purchase a membership card.  This cost $5 per person and they ask for some personal information.  You only have to do this for your first visit and credits for play are added to it.   We tried to use a gift card that we had and their system wasn't working.  The manager was called over and he could tell we were getting frustrated because we got there 20 minutes before the hourly rate increases and check in was taking long.  He apologized and was very polite.  To fix the issue he credited us two hours of play when we were intending to play one and gave us the gift card back.   This was a very nice thing he did to make us feel special for my birthday and first visit.    Now onto the play.  The clubs are included but you can bring your own if you want. The technology is top notch and the games are fun even if you aren't a golfer.  Our food and drink server was very nice and efficient.    We ordered Moscow Mules, the Mushi and the Buffalo Chicken flatbread.  My Husband and I really enjoyed the flatbread and Mules.  The Mushi was good but we probably wouldn't order it again.  All in all we had a great time.  You will drop some cash at this place but the atmosphere and service make it worth it...we will be back for active fun and special occasions.",

A great weather day and the staff was enthusiastic about getting everyone checked in and in a bay.  It wasn't long after we arrived that we were enjoying some great cold beverages, appetizers and swinging away!  Our server Toni took care of us and made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. The food quality is good and the prices are a bit on the high side but it's worth it.  I've been to the TopGolf Alexandria, Va, the 1st one and also the one in Sterling, Va. This one is a little different in that it does;'t have the surround sofas at the bays. All but a couple have the high top tables which are really better if your eating.  Is you like golf and being outside with your friends, you'll like this place.",

My bf and I ordered one cabana golf bag drink for our meals & ordered another one after! Highly recommend the cabana. My fried chicken sandwich with slaw was kind of disappointing. The meat was dry and the slaw was so little. It looked nothing like the picture. The server asked if I wanted it on the side and I said no. I'll probably do that next time so that I could get more. It was literally a tablespoon on my chicken burger. We went on a Friday night and it was packed but worth the wait. It's less than 10 minutes away from my home so I will definitely be a regular there! There were other menu items that I would like to try so that will definitely be something I would go back for too!",

Once you get your card it's much smoother. The wait staff are great, at least ours was. Food is aight, I'd pass on it since it's expensive enough as it is to just play. It's much better when you split the cost per hour with friends. Hour is fun, two hours is plenty, especially if you suck at golf and bend your wrist (ouch).   I will definitely be bringing more out of town guests to play golf, it's a cool place to go!",

    "text": "The idea behind Topgolf is awesome, but the execution is lacking. We came in on a Saturday night, so we were expecting a wait but when we were told 3 hours at 8pm I felt that that was a bit excessive. But I was super excited, so we decided to wait it out. We sat in the bar area on the main floor which was very crowded and lively-had a good vibe! It took a while for someone to come up to us, a few different waitresses kept asking if we had been helped yet and we said no still to not have anyone come actually take an order for about 10 minutes. Fortunately, we didn't mind because we were waiting for another couple to join us. In the meantime, we ordered drinks from the bar(got id'd which is fine....once) but then throughout the rest of the night we all had to show our ids about 3-4 more times to different people even though we clearly had drinks and had already been ID'd. But that was the least of my concerns throughout the night  When our friends got there, they had just sat down, took off their coats and a waiter going by spilt old, eaten food all over our friend and his jacket. He barely received an apology and had to persuade someone who was the manager I'm guessing who finally came over to give him an appetizer on the house(in my opinion should have been offered right away).  Our waitress was not very attentive and in the middle of my order pulled out her cellphone. I was blown away. Being in the restaurant business for a long time, I have never seen anyone do this at a table! And as soon as that happened, I knew that our order was going to be messed up(on top of being on her phone, she wasn't writing anything down). And big surprise, our orders came out all messed up. So needless to say, we were not happy.  We had to send one plate back and by the time it came back out we were moving outside to start playing golf. I will say, once we got out there, our experience at Topgolf improved tenfold! We had a fantastic waitress and it was much warmer outside than it was inside.  Overall, I really like the idea of Topgolf, but unfortunately most of our experience was ruined by some of the staff and how inattentive they were.",

I also had the opportunity to work with Steven for our corporate platinum membership which my company is EXTREMELY thrilled to be apart of. Being able to allow our clients to enjoy a nice day of golfing and networking are two wins!   The food I really good! Be sure to try the donut holes which are addictive and fries!

Once the \"hype\" dies down I'm sure it won't be like that all the time.   There is a small seating area downstairs where you can eat with maybe 15-20 tables. They have pool tables too. However my table only ordered some fries, a burger, and wings and it took nearly an hour and a half just to get it. Again, they're new they just open but as someone who's worked as a server when you tell me your food runners/servers don't know the table numbers or where to take it that's disconcerting and not that hard to learn. Everything we ordered had issues my friend and daughter were missing items and I got something different than what I ordered. Overall, the eating experience was okay.   When we finally got our bay we had an absolute blast. We will definitely be back for that and probably recommending reserving a spot before hand but since we were able to sit down and eat the wait didn't seem as long as it was.",

This place ROCKS!  I'm not a golfer and still thoroughly enjoyed my time there. The food is excellent, they have a great drink menu and the atmosphere is fun and fabulous!   We had the pleasure of dining on the second floor and then drinking/playing on the third floor and both of our BayHosts were outstanding (Vanessa on the 2nd fl and Kyle L on the 3rd fl). They were both incredibly friendly and attentive. They knew the menu, made perfect recommendations, and they're engaging personalities genuinely made the whole experience that much better.   My husband and I had the Hummus appetizer, a burger, and chicken nachos and we loved it all. Everything was served hot and fresh and was seasoned perfectly.   We also had an opportunity to spend some time at the rooftop bar and the bar staff was also fantastic! They were just as entertaining as they were friendly. I was DD for the night so I only nursed a couple of Sangrias for my entire time there, but my husband had a few diff beers and another drink. Next time, he will be DD so I can get one of their signature Golf Bag drinks!  Everyone was raving about them!  One thing that my husband and I consistently noticed and commented on a number of times is how much the employee truly seem to like their jobs and enjoy working there. As CRAZY busy as the place was and the demand that was put on the staff, everyone that we came into contact with embraced the madness and passed along their excitement to the customers. Kudos to Top Golf for bringing this fun establishment to Charlotte and for obviously going out of your way to make it a fun and pleasant work experience for your employees.   BTW...I can't wait to go back to try the breakfast menu!",

    "text": "This was my 5th visit to the Top Golf in Charlotte and each time the service is worse than the time before. I'll admit, yes, the concept is genius and me and my group always have a great time with the golfing portion of the day, however aside from the physical swinging of the golf club the rest of the experience is needing serious improvement. The service is among the worst I've experienced. On this particular visit, my group of 8 had to wait for a bay (completely understandable on a Saturday afternoon) so we decided to grab a late lunch at the bar and have some drinks. It took about 20 mins for a waitress to even approach our table and then another 25-30 mins for us to receive our drinks. We then had to chase down another waitress to place a food order, since ours was sitting at the bar completely disinterested in the needs of the customers. After about an hour of waiting, half the table received their food then the other half of the table received their orders about 30 minutes later. Within a two and half hour waiting period, our \"waitress\" came to our table to refill drinks/ check on our food/ check on the table as a whole about 2 times. Quite honestly, I was surprised by the lack of service. The wait staff seemed incredibly young and they all just crowded around the bar talking, right behind our table (literally bumping into our table several times because the staff was horsing around and being rowdy), for the entire 2 and a half hours. The service wasn't commendable once we were at our bay, but anything was an improvement from the disaster that was our dining/ drinking experience in their \"bar/restaurant\". While my group may be back to play golf, I can guarantee you we will not be returning to the bar/restaurant. Save your time and your money and eat before you go!",

    "text": "After hearing about the magic of Top Golf from friends in DC, I was curious to know how it would stack up against their experiences. Going on a Friday at noon, our group anticipated being able to go straight in and get a bay. As we drove up and saw almost every parking spot filled, we quickly realized it'd be a bit more complicated than that. Check-in was fairly simple; first-time visits require you buy a $5 member card that you use at every Top Golf location in the country. We availed ourselves of the spacious bar area while we waited on a bay to come open. Prices are fair, and the beer is cold. Once our bay came open, an attendant escorted us to it, helped check us in, and we were on our way. Wait staff tended to us throughout the afternoon, and both the drinks and food were good. The golf in and of itself is great fun, with a variety of modes available for everyone from beginners to scratch golfers. They could do with some better fans to keep the air moving during the summer, but it did little to dampen the mood.",

We got a seat immediately and waited 18 minutes for someone to greet us and take our drink order. Many employees walked past us and didn't a knowledge. A couple more groups sat down and the waitress decided to clean tables and sweep rather than acknowledge and take orders. You could tell there were issues as other tables sent back food and management had to go to other tables. Our food was terrible. We ordered a quesadilla and pretzel bites. The quesadilla was cheese in a tortilla shell and the beer cheese with pretzel bites was sour and the worst I have ever tasted. We did not eat. I so regret spending our money on the food for the terrible service and terrible food. The hour of of went well. I would recommend just golfing and do t sit in restaurant to eat. I wish I had my $45 back.",

I will definitely return . If top golf corporate happens to read this you have a tremendous manager in Cannon.",

It's a good place but had issues with first experience. Card didn't work after we loaded money to it. Fan behind us stopped working. The app is not up for Charlotte yet, bummer. Long wait to buy membership card which is required to hit. Take your own clubs if you are a serious golfer. Theirs have very flexible graphite shafts. Wish I brought mine. Food was good. We had fun. Hope they get the kinks worked out.",

Not sure what we did to piss that little punk B off behind the counter, but their whole seating system is F-Ed. Not to mention, ONE waitress trying to take care of the entire 3rd floor bar. 30 minutes to get a bucket of beer. Probably closer to 45. The whole place is a huge joke. If you're looking to drink $6 beers with some of the largest douche bags in the city, go put that name on the waiting list and enjoy the scenery. DO NOT go here.",

I was willing to wait for my family. But they didnt want too. We are very disappointed in the maze of lines that we had would if gone thru but to achieve wat other companys do so gracefully.  Top golf thumbs down.   Well go spend our money elsewhere!",

The experience starts with there being nowhere near enough parking so you either have to stalk people leaving for 20 minutes to snag a spot or pay for valet. When you get inside, the service at counters to sign up and in the bar is terribly slow. Also, they don't seem willing to help arrange groups play together even when there are booths open side by side. Oh well, at least it's overpriced!",

We were told 1 hr 1/2 and and later requested to speak to another customer service employee and then were sprung upon the decision that we had to wait another couple hours. My daughter has never been here and we invited our former family member down for the weekend in NC to show him around. This was one of our options to have them experience and it was an awful one. I've never felt so bad in my life wasting their time when we could've been doing other things. We figured we'd eat here as well and waited patiently to be put into a bay. We were not very happy with the outcome of our Saturday evening with the family. Wouldn't recommend this at all unless you request a reservation.",
