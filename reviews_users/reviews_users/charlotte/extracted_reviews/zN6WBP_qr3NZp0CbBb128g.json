The girl helping us was short in expression, didn't say hi or thank you and just overall wasn't friendly. All of the tables were dirty (we were the only customers in there) and there was no music playing, overall just terrible ambiance. Will definitely be ordering food from here again, just to go.",

I ordered the medium (2 scoops of rice + 3 proteins/fish servings). I subbed out the rice for mixed greens and loved how customizable the process went from there. The fish was fresh, the sauces were delicious (loved the \"suggested combos\" and agree with previous feedback that the spicy mayo packs some tasty heat). The addition of complimentary add-ins (green onion, ginger, cucumber, jalapeno, etc.) and sides (cucumber salad and seaweed salad) made my lunch perfect. I payed $1 extra for the avocado and the portion and quality was well worth it! So happy you're in the neighborhood!",

When they served me my food, they didn't even try to make it look nice. The portions of the fish were small. My server just threw everything into the bowl without a care. When it came time to eat it, the rice was so undercooked, I didn't bother eating the rest of it. I just ate the fish and toppings and threw the rest away. I'm also questioning the quality of their ingredients because I felt a bit sick after eating their food. I eat raw sushi on a weekly basis, and I never have gotten sick from sushi before. I'd rather eat sushi bought at the grocery store. The only reason I'm giving two stars is the customer service was great. I'm glad that I only paid for 50% of the price though. I'll maybe give them a second chance in a few months, considering they just opened and I shouldn't expect everything to be perfect. But there definitely is a lot a room for improvement.",

Most sushi places hook you up with very little fish/protein and a ton of rice. Poke bowls are the next level. Choose your protein size up to 8 oz and 4 different kinds. I went with spicy tuna, tuna, salmon, and octopus. I highly recommend the tuna and spicy tuna. Texture and flavor were top class. Octopus was rubbery and salmon was mostly flavorless. Must try. A little on the pricy side. I went on a half price day. Usually the large is  around 12.95. Small is 8.95 and medium 10.95.",

I asked for avocado but then changed my mind when I saw it and it was brown... like they tried to get me to pay an extra $1 for brown avocado. What I actually did have was not good.

But today, my server ruined the entire bowl of food by over-saturating it with sauce.  I have not had that experience the other two times so I was eager to go back each time until today. I also felt very rushed to make my selections. There was only one person in line behind me so it want as if there was a long line. And I made my selections with reasonable speed. It felt very stressful. Not the easy experience I had previously both at peak lunch hours. So this is a note to diners and management. Diners watch your server to make sure they don't overload the bowl with too much sauce. Management work with your team on a consistent dining experience.",

Nice amount of sauces and they give you recommendations of what sauces to mix. Happy about the Atrium Health discount!",

The worker behind the counter helped the rest of the way.  She was very helpful in suggestions and explained what they all were.  I got a mix of two sauces to top of the bowl.  The flavor was great.

Anyway I've passed by Poke Bar a few times and finally found the time to visit. Parking was easy. If you know me you know that's a plus. The staff is courteous. I went in the evening and there wasn't a line or a wait. They seemed to only have two people on hand at the time. The staff is also pretty knowledgeable. I had a rice bowl with salmon and things like seaweed and edamame. They also didn't skimp on the soy sauce. They didn't skimp on anything actually. I got the small size but it was still pretty filling. I drove all the way home and it was still good. Needless to say since I do enjoy poke bowls I will be back ...maybe tomorrow lol",

Your menu is up when you walk in or you can grab one of the checklists to read off your order to whomever is making your bowl.  I decided on a white rice with two proteins (small size) so went with spicy tuna and octopus. I added seaweed salad, ginger, edamame and a bunch of other mix ins. Wasabi has a punch!  It costs anywhere from about $9 to $13 depending on what size bowl you get. I would think you could split the largest bowl with a friend easily.",

The portions are generous, the food is fresh & the employees are nice & patient. I will be coming back at least once a week! So glad this place opened up.  I moved here from southern CA a year ago and was hoping poke shops would open up in Charlotte. A few sprung up in the past several months but they really limit the sides, toppings, mix-ins and even sauces. I was used to the generous portions from Pokeland & KreAsian in Thousand Oaks, CA where for ~$11 (tax included), it would take 2 meals to finish my poke bowl. WHAT?!  I was so disappointed when I visited my 1st Charlotte poke place on Pineville Matthews Rd. I was served a sad kid size portion and was still hungry afterwards. Another poke joint on South Street is good too but they limit sides & toppings. I mean come on...how much does corn, edemame, picked onions, etc. cost? Give your customers 1 serving of each thing you offer in the price. So, BIG kudos to Poke Bar for doing this.",

I ordered a small bowl - 1 scoop of rice with 2 proteins (tuna and salmon) and then added on all the toppings/sauces/crunchy things I would typically want in a sushi roll. Here's how I see it: for $9 I am getting close to two sushi rolls worth of food that tastes very similar with exactly what I want in each bite. For this reason alone, I feel like I am getting my money's worth. I don't need to eat my meal twice to feel it was worth it. I don't need to be rolled out of a place for feel it was worth it. I am getting plenty, it's fresh and delicious and it makes me want to come back again since I am not overeating. I will gladly pop back in before heading to Trader Joe's so that I don't buy the entire store.",

This place is clean, the food is fresh and you get sides included with your bowl. Win. Win. Win.   I got the medium with 3 proteins and asked for only one scoop of brown rice (the medium comes with 1.5 scoops of rice). Everything was well portioned. The first review of this place should really have been a 5 star one, so much fresh selection! So many wonderful choices! Both of my bowls were less than $6 with the 50% opening special.   I give them a little bit of slack too because it's opening days. It was a little hard to hear the people behind the counter because of how loud the restaurant itself is, maybe it's the music? Maybe it's the sound bouncing off the walls and floor? I just had to ask what they said a few times here and there. The staff is friendly, although they seemed easily distracted. But I can't blame them on opening day, there was a lot going on.   *I'm also wondering what they do with the brown trays. Every order gets one, but then they serve it to you in the plastic bowl (which I'll probably keep and wash out for cheap Tupperware). Are they recycling them? You can compost cardboard! But I'll save that for another day conversation with a manager. Loved my experiences here so far!",

I love that they mix your toppings together. If you get a medium bowl you really get more like 4 proteins because you get sides so you can choose crab. I feel like you get a great value here unlike many other poke places. There are a few women that work here that make me not give a full 5 stars, two ladies in particular just have poor customer service... never smile or greet you. More the what do you want attitude than what may I get you attitude! I want so badly to give 5 stars but that really gets me, SMILE sometimes ladies! There's a gentlemen that works that, wish I knew his name, who is AWESOME and warm! It just makes a very big difference in the overall experience!

    "text": "NOT A PLACE FOR THOSE WITH DECISION PARALYSIS.  Poke Bar is a chain from California and I think I actually have visited a prior location and also been overwhelmed.  It's like Chipotle, but with no context- I've had plenty of burritos and have a good idea of what things will go together, but I haven't made many poke bowls (or any poke bowls).  First you pick your size, which is # scoops of protein + base.  I got a small which had a nice small bowl size of white rice and two scoops of protein.  You can choose brown rice, white rice, tortilla chips, or salad.  Then there are something like EIGHT kinds of protein to choose from.  I'm a math person so I can tell you that there are a LOT of combinations here.  I picked salmon, which is a good standby, and albacore.  Next you slide down to the mix-ins.  I picked cucumber, masago, and green onion.  Too much green onion for me, but was that my fault?  I'm not sure!  I should've picked onion, maybe?  Also there are like eight mix ins and you can pick any of them.  When they mix your proteins with your mix-ins you can also choose any combination of like six sauces?  I picked spicy mayo, ponzu, and sesame oil, and have no idea what contributed what flavors to my bowl.  But it was a suggested sauce-mix from a little laminated piece of paper they had on hand.  There were six or eight combinations of sauce mixes there too.  It was too much.  Surprise!  It comes with two sides!  Luckily there are only three to choose from.  I can unequivocally support the seaweed salad (yum!) and the crab salad.  So I would guess the third choice is also good.   Then just in case you haven't made enough choices there are toppings at the end.  Furikake, sesame seeds, nuts, crispy garlic, crispy onions (like the ones on top of green bean casserole).  I said I wanted it all, and I think I only got garlic and onions.  But those are great.  Too many crispy onions.  See my picture.  After the hassle of ordering, and they were very nice through all that, you get your poke bowl.  It was tasty?  If you've had poke before this is just a normal poke place, not super fresh and amazing and fancy but still fine.  If you haven't had it before I suggest you try it, if only for the experience.  This is how they could increase stars: have suggested bowls!  Like \"salmon+tuna+onion+house sauce + garlic\" or something.  Name them after the employees or cool customers.  It's too overwhelming as is.",

Avocado is $1.00 more and given the amount you get, it may not be worth it (unless you love & can't live without your avocado fix).  My mini ordered the shrimp bowl with rice and I was shocked to see a 7-year old practically lick the bowl - he was happy with the sesame oil shoyu sauce & all-in it was a relatively low cost dinner. We will definitely be back and are thrilled to see this has popped up in Blakeney. I sense as people catch on, this place will get uber packed",

The \"small\" options (below) are certainly generous and affordable (~$9). Given the weekday lunchtime busyness, would have picked another one to train an employer at the register to speed things along, albeit it was a cordial environment. Nonetheless, can't wait to visit again and explore the rest of the menu!",

Assembly line salad, similar to the sub and the burrito place but I think this is a whole lot healthier.  Start off the size of your meal and choose your base (rice, spring mix, kale noodles). Add your proteins (tuna, salmon, scallops, shrimp, etc.). Add your mix-ins (corn, cucumber, onions, jalapenos, etc.) and sauce (ponzu, spicy mayo, wasabi shoyu), and lastly, add your sides (cucumber salad, seaweed salad, shredded krab) and toppings (ginger, masago, avocado). And there you go.  It can be done completely keto friendly by avoiding the rice and the other starchy toppings. It's delicious!  [Review 11480 overall, 1259 of 2019.]",

I like the amount of sides and toppings you can put in as you can really customize it with something different, and they seem to have more options than other poke places I've been to in this area.    I have just two critiques: One, the amount of sauce is just too much. Maybe that was my mistake for what I ordered, but eventually the spicy mayo completely overpowered the rest of the flavors. I find this problem with a lot of poke places but I never learn my lesson and keep ordering it.  Would recommend sticking to one or two sauces.  My second and biggest complaint is that they have no signal for when customer enters and the employees have been in the back the entire time I've been here.  I had to get their attention through the window, but I watched no fewer than 3 separate customers come and leave because they waited for a few minutes and there was no one to take their order.  One guy got their attention by shouting.  Buy a simple door chime and this would solve the problem, or put a camera in the kitchen area, since this is actually causing you to lose business!",

    "text": "For someone not fond of sushi I sure love Poke Bar!!! I've been coming to Poke Bar since they hosted a Yelp event last year for Elite members and its been a great exploration into my sushi limits!  I think I love it so much because of the mix of Asian flavors in a new way and the endless combination possibilities. I'm very consistent with my order only big difference I make is the size of the bowl and the sauces I put on top. I'm stuck on the shrimp as my protein. I would love to venture out but I'm not a fan of fish and don't want to ruin a good thing.  I love the mix of the toppings and the sauces. When you eat it with the hot fresh steamed rice it's an explosion of flavors. I always get ginger and that adds to the spice and flavor.   One great thing is the checkin reward and the reward program they have. I always hate when I checkin after paying but the price is very affordable and keeps me coming back!   They are always very fast with the ordering and making of your bowl and you are in and out with in a few moments. The ingredients are very fresh and they don't keep a lot out on the line.  This location is in a great spot in the Cherry neighborhood. The only draw back is at lunch time the parking lot is packed!!!   I've recently got my mom and nephew hooked to the Poke bowl so I see more visit for us in the future.   Poke Bar  601 South Kings Dr, Ste K, Charlotte, NC 28204 Monday March 18, 2019 11:45pm",

The medium bowl ($10.99) came with 3 scoops of protein and as always I get salmon for all my scoops. Choose your base, veggies/mix ins, sauces, and toppings as you would at any other poke place. I like to keep my sauce simple with shoyu soy sauce and sesame oil so I can taste the fish. And I like to pile on the veggies/toppings, as you can see in my photo.

    "text": "I love that the poke wave has finally swept across Charlotte.   This appears to be one of the most (if not the most) affordable poke spot here so far. You can get a small bowl (4 ounces) for $8.99. Medium (6oz) is $10.99, Large (1/2 pound) $12.99. You can get as many toppings as you want (there's more than 20 to pick from), including seaweed salad, cucumber salad and crab salad.   According to the owner, they get their fish delivered six days a week from a local Charlotte company. Their options include octopus, seared, albacore, shrimp, marinated scallops, salmon, tuna, spicy tuna, and tofu. They make all their sauces from scratch and have both gluten free and vegetarian options. I love that they also have a kale noodle option.  Personally, the small bowl is the perfect size for me. Could I eat more? Probably, but this makes for a great lunch. I like to do tuna and salmon with the kale noodles, seaweed salad, crab salad, edamame, pineapple, jalapeno, and add avocado (that one is extra). I like all the sauces, but usually do a mix of the house and sweet chili.   This parking is small and it gets super busy. Add on to that, an Orange Theory just opened here, so it's only going to get worse. The good news: Poke Bar is available for delivery on Doordash, Postmates, and Uber Eats.",

Honestly, it's the combination of the fact that all their ingredients are fresh and taste fantastic, along with their price point. $10 for a bowl and a drink, and I couldn't even finish a small - their bowls are packed! I went for a small bowl with spicy tuna and shrimp (small gets 2 proteins) and then you get to pick all your sides. On top of that, you get to pick 2 salads, so you can really add a third protein with either the imitation crab or seaweed salad (they also have cucumber salad). The spicy tuna had just the right amount of spice, and their seaweed salad reminded me of one of my favorites in Hawaii. Overall, it was delicious, filling and light!   The staff was super nice, and was patient with me knowing it was my first time. Don't be surprised if its empty in there (dine in seating wise), while I was there, there were at least 3 delivery pickups and a bunch of to-go orders being called in, so they're definitely keeping busy!",

Now that I have been here, I can finally take it off. Anyway, they serve food in Poke Bowls. It's served in about 6 steps.   //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// The first step is to choose what size you want which is either small, medium or large. This is the size bowl you want. I chose a small. The second part of the first step is to choose a base which is either white rice, brown rice, noodles, mixed greens, or tortilla chips.   The second step is to choose a protein which of the following:  tuna, spicy tuna, salmon, albacore, scallop, shrimp, octopus or tofu.   The 3rd step is to choose your mix ins which is the following:  corn, cucumber, jalapeno, cilantro, kale, sweet onion, green onion, pineapple or edamame.   The 4th step is to choose a sauce which is if the following;  sesame oil, ponzu, spicy mayo, sweet chili, sriracha, wasabi shoyu, shoyu, or House.   The 5th step is to choose your sides which is of the following: cucumber salad, imitation crab, or seaweed salad.   The 6th step is to finally choose your toppings. The toppings include: avocado, ginger, wasabi, masago, crispy onion, crispy garlic, sesame seeds or furikake.  /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////  Customer Service:  Well, I was taken care fast. The person behind the counter was friendly and helpful since she knew it was my first visit. She was patient with me and helped guide me through the different steps.  On Scene:  Of course I ordered a poke bowl. The brown rice was cooked and tasted great. It was delicious. I enjoyed every bite.   One tip I would give is to be sure to use your 15 percent off check in offer. Since you have Yelp, all you do is check in once here and the coupon will come up. Just show this check in offer to them and you can save money.  Final Thoughts:  I have to say that my visit was an enjoyable one. I came here to eat healthily and I did just that.  Yep, I highly recommend this restaurant especially if your not from around here.",

I sampled a small bowl with greens. You get 4oz of protein in a small (2 each of your choice). I had the salmon and tuna which were both full of flavor and fatty. They offer sauce recommendations which were handy for this first timer. My only critique would be on how they mixed the items. It was done in a brown paper carton and then put on top of the greens. It seemed like a less than sustainable way to go.   It seemed like a popular spot for to-go and doordash orders. I was the only one who stayed to dine in for the 45 minutes I was there. It's a great casual vibe for some good healthy protein.",

    "text": "This a new-ish poke in the same shopping plaza as Mama Ricotta's on King Drive.  It's a small store, but still plenty of room to sit or you can get it to go and sit along the greenway across the street.  The staff is helpful if it's your first time in and the selection of raw seafood is really good.  A small bowl is around $7 but they give you good portions of two protein choices, two mix-ins, choice of white or brown rice and then unlimited choices for your add-in, so it can be as light, filling or share-able as you would like to make it.  The salmon was really good and fresh and I enjoyed the marinated scallops as well.  The location is fairly convenient for me, so I will definitely add this to my to-go list.",

I would say it's pretty comparable to the other options I've had around town.   I think the topping selection is a little more limited than Seoul Poke Bowl.  I do think they had the most expansive protein options that I've seen though.  The quality is good, the serving size was good, the staff was incredibly nice and friendly.   It's done Chipotle style and we had no wait when we were there. I would definitely come back again.",

The menu breaks down a 4-step process to build your own poke bowl. If you're like me and aren't sure what all of the terms mean, just ask the folks behind the counter. With a baby on the way I had to select non-raw items and went with the scallops (which the server said are steamed) and shrimp, loads of veggies, and a fun sauce combo to top it off. Everything was fresh, the serving area was clean, and gloves were worn the entire time (which I always appreciate).   The small bowl was too much food for me - one grain, two proteins, and all the toppings you could want. My husband ordered a medium (1.5 scoops of \"grain,\" 3 proteins) and also left super full.   4 stars because food was delicious and fresh, but I wasn't impressed by the friendliness of the staff and (I hate to say this) the bathroom was disgusting. Giving them the benefit of the doubt and calling it an \"off night.\"",

All said and done we ordered 2 larges and 1 to-go, and we weren't disappointed. The choices and selection are rather simple, but you do get to customize every single visit to try different combinations. There are more flavorful and different toppings at other local poke joints around town, but this place keeps it straight-forward and consistent, due to the chain status.   Future visits will likely order only the medium size due to the decent value at that level.",

    "text": "Poke is one of my favorite things in the whole world and the Poke Bar lets me get it the way I want it!  This was my first time at the Poke Bar and I was super excited to hear that there was a location like 10 minutes from where I live( I work from home so this is the best news). I went during the end of the work lunch crunch and it was very exciting to see how busy it was even at the time. The cool thing I first noticed was the fact that a lot of people ordered it to go. So people in a rush could run in, grab their poke (already made to how they ordered), and go!  So here is what you do: 1st: Pick your Base. Size of bowl and base item (white rice, brown rice, spring mix. I picked white rice.  2nd: Pick your Protein. Depending on your size of bowl, you can pick between 2-4 proteins. You can mix and match or double up on proteins like Tuna, Spicy Tuna, Salmon, Shrimp, Tofu, etc. I love Tuna and being from Florida I am so used to fresh fresh tuna. I can tell you that the tuna was fresh and very good.  3rd: Pick your Mix-Ins. You can top your poke with things like Cucumbers. Sweet Onions, Kale, Corn, Pineapple, Edamame, etc. I had them pick what to put in top and pretty sure I got it all. One item that I was surprised and liked was pineapple. It was nice to cut the spiciness of the Tuna and Jalapenos.  4th: Pick a Flavor. You can get any sauces like the their house dressing, ponzu, spicy mayo, sweet chili, etc. I had spicy mayo on mine.  5th: Pick a Garnish. You can choose between Wontons, Ginger, Wasabi, Edamame, Avocado, Masago, etc. I kind of think some of these were also in my mix in steps but I got furikake, edamame, and ginger on top of mine.  6th: Choose 2 sides. The sides include imitation crab, seaweed salad, or cucumber salad. I got the crab and seaweed salad. I love seaweed salad, but I probably wouldn't get the crab again because I just love fresh fish.  As you can tell there is so much you can get on your poke bowl and you can truly make it the way you want. Honestly you could go like every day and get something different. They also have Mochi to treat yourself after your poke. All in all it was a great experience and I will definitely be back!",

I do wish they had just a few more choices. They definitely fall short here compared to my go-to poke bar. I'm looking for you, spicy crab.   You start out picking your base, then your proteins, then your toppings, sauces & finally garnishments.   My go-to order here would be white rice. spicy tuna, salmon, edamame, pineapple, cilantro, green onion, cucumbers, ponzu sauce & spicy mayo ... with some crunchy onions to finish it off.   If you're in the 'hood, i'd definitely stop here to fill your poke cravings. I personally wouldn't drive out of my way to pick this place over any others, though.   P.S. Their wasabi sauce & spicy mayo are both HOT. Use sparingly, you can always add but you cannot take away. Learned that the hard way my first trip here.",

There was a line but the staff was doing a good job of moving the line quickly and being patient. Staff was very friendly and helpful!  I ended up getting the medium Bowl which includes three proteins and one and a half scoops of rice. I was able to eat on this for a second meal, so I do think it's worth the price.  My only real issue with the place is how small the portions are on the proteins. The protein was good, but it was chopped in a very small pieces rather than large cut pieces.  I enjoyed how spicy the tuna was and loved getting to add plenty of jalapenos for spice. Sauces were good as well.",
