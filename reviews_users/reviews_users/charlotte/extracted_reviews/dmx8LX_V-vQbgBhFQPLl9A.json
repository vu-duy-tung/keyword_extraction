Been here with large parties as well and they are very accommodating and quick with service.  Can be a bit loud but what would you expect for a sports bar.  They have outside seating which is nice in the summer so you can bring your pets if needed.",

(Fill up the cup!)   If you sit near either of the doors on a cold day, you WILL be cold.   Sports fans, there are enough televisions around the room to have you covered no matter where you sit.  If you drink alcohol, they have you covered. Big bar with lots of bottles.  Parking on the front isn't my cup of tea. If you're good at backing in, you're good to go. If you have to pull into the space, you'll have to back out into the driving area, where cars are driving in both directions and there are cars parked on the other side of the lot.   The lot is really too narrow for all that action and I wonder how safe it is at night, when visibility might not be as good and folk have been drinking.  I prefer to park on the \"back\" lot, where there's more space in the driving lanes (but you still need to be careful of those driving back and forth).",

    "text": "Been a while since my last Fox & Hound experience so I was pretty stoked for trying the new location (to me) at Northlake.  It is a bit of a haul for me but peer pressure prevailed and I ended up having a decent time here.  Our server, Meghan was super nice and friendly.  It did get a bit busy with the Panthers game on a Thursday night - also simultaneous trivia on the same night made for an interesting time.  We didn't stay for trivia but I would have been a little peeved since the game sound was interrupted by the shrill, way-to-excited voice of the woman who runs trivia.  Atmosphere is similar to a lot of the other Fox & Hound locations in Charlotte:  dim with tvs all over the place.  The tables in here are very small!  The 4 top we were sitting at was totally full once all of us ordered drinks.   Then the food came out and it was a shuffling, puzzle match as far as finding places to set things.  It worked out though.  Fish & Chips came out for me with 3 huge, honking pieces of beer battered/fried goodness that a proceeded to scarf down like I had never eaten fish & chips before.  It was nice and crispy.  The fries that came with it were okay - slaw on the side wasn't really anything to write home about.  I'd say this is a solid hangout place if you live in the area.  Unfortunately for me, I had a nice lonely 40min drive home to Matthews, but I can see myself doing it occassionally.",

I've served in restaurants from the cheap, under $10 meals to high end fine dining in DC so I get that service is not always 100% at times. But let me say that the service I had today was awful. We saw our server Chante a grand total of three times... Once for drinks, once to order (\"what do you want,\" she asked us without even a hello) and once when she ran our cards AFTER someone else brought us the check when we asked them.   We finished eating at 5:08.... we got our check at 5:28. In those 20 minutes, we watched her dance in the kitchen, stand at the bar, check her phone at the hostess stand numerous times, stand with with her coworkers on the floor and walk by us more than 5 times with no acknowledgment.   With only 5 tables in the place (and 5 servers) I can't imagine she was overwhelmed.   On the food side- very mediocre. Nothing I'd go out of my way for again.",

You could taste the beer but it wasn't overwhelming. We also had the jacked up cheese wedges, I had them before at another Fox & Hound and they were much better there. These had too much breading and not enough cheese. It may have been a one time thing.  Most of their beer selection is standard beers, not a whole lot of local options but a few.",

We are regulars here on Thursday nights for the live trivia, also because it is $2 domestic and $2.50 imports night.  The wait staff are friendly and cute, our favorite server at this Northlake store is Fran, she is friendly, fast, and remembered my drink of choice after only my first week there.  The beer selection is above average for your average sports bar, lot of choices in imports, including a couple of my favs Smithwicks and Boddingtons.  Besides live trivia on Thursdays, we have seen Jello Wrestling (check photos), Bikini contests, Karaoke (Sundays and Tuesdays), and various themed holiday celebrations.  Make sure you join the FREE All Star Brew club, after only 50 beers you get half price wings for life.  There are a lot of other benefits as well, including free appetizer parties each month.  It is valid at all Fox and Hounds in the US and Bailey's and Champs restaurants as well.  If trivia on Thursday brings you here come early, it starts at 9 but bar will be filled up by then.  P.S.  The bathrooms have mouthwash dispensers if you find yourself going overboard with the Spicy garlic wings!",

Saw numerous servers leave several times out the back door to smoke cigarettes instead of tending to customers. The server informed me that the reason my order took so long is because they forgot to put my order in when I called, and didn't inform me of the issue until I had already been waiting for an additional 30 mins on top of the 25 that they had estimated after I called in. If you are wondering why your tips are struggling and you can hardly maintain 400$ a week at your job, you should probably take into consideration the value of work ethic and pride you put into your job. The reason that no one takes you seriously is because you can hardly take yourself seriously and complete the simple task at hand.",

I am a handicapped individual so the high seats are a little bothersome for me...we went on a not so busy night and there were no low seats available..only high chairs and high booth seats, so I was a bit uncomfortable...also the seats are rather torn apart..floor was rather sticky and/or slippery depending on where you stepped...same with our table, just wasn't cleaned with much care..  As I said service was great, the food was good not great...I ordered fish and chips, something I've ordered a lot at other fox and hounds....I was able to sub out my Cole slaw for a second order of tater tots..instead of fries...fish was great and the tater sauce is good, may not be house made...tater tots were cooked poorly on some and good on others...crunchy or soggy, depending on which pile you took from...it was a TON of food..more than I could finish, but they had these mason jar desserts that I could not pass on...they were limited time so I am not sure how long they will be around for...  We will be back, I can't not come back because of seating...but I hope in the future this is something that can be addressed",

No soup, no tacos, no flatbread, no French dip. All on a Saturday night. Service was mediocre at best. No manager came out to apologize for the inconvenience of having no food to serve with the exception of fried food.

She went to the back to ask the cook what he made, and came back out saying \"I definitely put corn on the ticket and he made it flour tortillas\".  To top it off I also ordered chicken nachos, and they came out cold. My chicken and cheese were cold and hard. I will not be coming back here. Sorry Fox n Hound.",

But there are never enough servers, service is slow, crowd is often shady, and what could be a delicious menu is poorly executed.  Potentially excellent food often arrives cold.  I keep going to show support for this business that I want to see thrive, but always leave underwhelmed and frustrated.",

I was there to see the Panthers whip up on the 49'ers! Lot's of fans wearing their game day colors.  Emily was nice, pleasent & professional and took good care of us. They also have daily drink specials and daily $4 Blue Moon's.",

The mediocre food, sub-par service, and limited beer selection don't redeem this place that is calm by day and sometimes burlesque by night.  I don't like the feeling of seeing all these flyers for all these flesh fest events they have.  I don't like the Hooters experience and this place gives off more of that side of sex vibe.

They have a good selection of beers both draft and bottles so it is nice to get a recommendation when you first arrive. ( Get the first one poured and then relax and actually READ the beer menu.)  Anyone can be nice when there aren't customer concerns... It is the True judge of a place with their reaction to a negative situation.  They get 5 stars for a great attitude and quick resolution.   Ordered a beer and the flavor was \"off\".  Let the bartender know.   With a big smile she apologized and quickly offered an option for resolution. She also let her manager know. The manager personally checked the situation and verified that something was off and replaced the beer with another apology for the inconvenience.

    "text": "The food was pretty good! Id give it at least 3-4 stars however heading here on a Saturday night messed up our entire night. Destiny our server was nice but this place was actually one of the worse places I have been in Charlotte on a Saturday. The place was filthy we sat down at a dirty table (once I told the server she cleaned it off for us) and it took almost 2 hours to actually receive our food when the place was not slammed at all. Our server seemed like she got it to us as fast as she could since it was still warm. The bar looked less than 1/4 full and it took about 50 minutes to receive our adult cheer order. The most disturbing things that need to be noted 1) ridiculously under staffed 2) awfully dirty 3) poor customer service 4) wait time for food 5) atmosphere created 6) no mgmt was present so it seemed like it didnt matter that everything was a mess 7) dirty bathrooms 8) hostess stand had dirty dishes stashed there 9) no sign to seat yourself or wait to be seated 10) poor dress code   We watched four employees walk by 4 tables that were dirty the entire time we were there...people came in and would not be seated for 20 minutes but it was because all the tables were so dirty but empty. Suggestions...get a attentive manager. One who cares. Staff properly. Train your staff. Floors were not picked up and this was just unheard of in Charlotte! Not cool at all. Never going back here...the people working seemed miserable and unhappy to be there...overworked for sure and negative.our server seemed to push through all that but the rest of the folks seemed annoyed to be working.",

My family came in from NY and we decided to stop by (after their 11 hour drive) The place looked empty, but it still took ten minutes before a server came to our table. It took another (at least) twenty minutes before we got our beers, and our server forgot to put in our app order ( chips and queso.... apparently she didn't know we actually wanted it). She told us to call her over if we needed anything... at this point we realized she was serving almost all the seated tables in the place by herself. Our food came out (everyone agreed the food was A+, hence the 3 stars), and nobody ever came to see if it was all okay... my father had to walk to the server stand and get extra napkins when his burger got messy. The manager... or who we believed was the manager...was just standing around watching football and playing with the TVs, not helping at all. When she finally came back, she explained that she was taking care of a party in the back room and they kept her back for a while. My father asked for the check three tones before she realized he was asking (she was busy trying to talk). We watched her go to the computer, then walk directly past us without stopping, and didn't drop the check off for another ten minutes. At this point, we had been at fox and hound for 2 hours. Way past time to go.  I work in the service industry- I host, I've bartenders, I've served. I get it. While the server definitely could have done some things MUCH better, in my opinion the real the failure came from the management. This server had no help, we watched other staff standing around doing nothing, and there was no manager walking around to ensure all patrons were enjoying their visit. After a long day for everyone, it was disappointing to have such poor service, and for no one to even pretend to care. Love getting drinks here, but will definitely think twice about bringing anyone for dinner again.",

The chicken was not overcooked and still moist.  Crispy skin too.  The buffalo sauce had a little tang to it but not much heat.  Bleu cheese dressing on the side was largely devoid of any chunks of cheese.    Honorable mention goes to the spinach & artichoke dip.  A little better than the Costco variety but the chips were a bit salty and that made the dish.  So-so ribs and cheese sticks.  The soft pretzels weren't a very good choice as they dried out pretty quickly on the buffet.  The bar cheese sauce that was with them but this offering may be better suited to table service than a group gathering.  Good beer list.  Lots of draft options.",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to the Northlake Mall area and to Fox and Hound Pub & Grille.   This tavern features typical sports bar food, including chicken wings, fish n chips, and burgers.  Dora here. Early birds again. Instead of closing the bars, we open them. :)  Because of that, service was attentive and the food arrived before I guzzled half my iced tea.  The Biergarten pretzels, two baked and salted Bavarian-style pretzels with a side of queso were soft, not overly salty, and the queso kicked in a good way.  I ordered the Blackened Fish Tacos, cod fillets with coleslaw, cilantro-lime sour cream and pickled red onions.   These tacos were great. The spices on the fish and the freshness of the coleslaw caused the whole taco to work together. My only regret with these tacos is the cilantro-lime favor should be more prominent.   Dora here. I. Love. Chili. So if a restaurant offers chili nachos on a menu, I'm all over it. But these Nacho Muchos were mucho on the cheese, slim on the chili. No layers of flavor, in some spots globs of cheese. Cheese lovers will be in heaven with this nacho platter, but I prefer a bit more...beef. I salivated over tasting the lime sour cream, but that didn't materialize. Overall, good nachos, but didn't quite quench my chili taste bud.    We rate this restaurant 3 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving good food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

It was nearly 25 mins before our water arrived and that was only after flagging down any waitstaff in sight to help us.    We ordered the tots (average at best); the Tuscan flatbread pizza which was good and the Barbacoa  tacos which were delish! We originally ordered the southwest chicken rolls which they were sold out of but tried to charge us for them anyway   Our waitress Simone apologized profusely for the slow service but never really picked up the pace ---- I asked for ketchup for our tots n they were half eaten by the time she brought it after asking her again    Josh the manager listened patiently to my feedback and promptly discounted our food bill by 50% - go Josh and then he promised it would be better our next time!   Hmmmmm not so sure we'll return but thanks anyway.     The big take away is this if you are in no kind of hurry at all then yeah try em out but if you have things to do people to see and places to go keep moving past this place!!!!!",

We sat down, ordered drinks, appetizers, and food.  Our waitress was well informed and prompt in checking in on us.  I ordered the chicken tacos. There were three adequately proportioned tacos with cheddar and Monterey jack cheese (not too much) and pico de gallo, served with chips and salsa.  I thought this was a pretty good meal for $10.  For dessert, we shared a S'Mores Parfait.  Even though it was dark, the parfait had far too much chocolate but I enjoyed it. I had no idea the restaurant was at Northlake and am glad we stumbled upon it.  They had 18+ television monitors - I found it a bit difficult to maintain focus on one game.  However, I look forward to another visit.",

We went with the mozzarella sticks and the chicken quesadilla appetizers. The mozzarella sticks were great. The chicken quesadilla was one of the best I've had. I would come back just for that quesadilla. It's pulled chicken and not chunks of chicken which completely changed the flavor profile.

The really sad part is that she was not alone, but was the only one working. Two others were too busy playing connect four and talk on their cell phone on speaker. We rarely go for this exact reason. Can't say we will return anytime soon.",

    "text": "Turns out the food's delish, the second time your order it with a manager!! 3 stars for the Beyond Meat Burgers and Parmesan fries *only*  I feel like to understand the depth of the disappointment we experienced you need the backstory: my boyfriend found a torn piece of this place's burger menu and noticed they served Beyond Meat Burgers. As vegetarians continuously searching of the next great plant based burger and each restaurant's version of it, we went for it.   Keely, the bartender didn't seem too please to have a to-go customer, and was only halfway into taking my order. One of her regulars walked up and she immediately greeted him and started taking his order whilst in the middle of mine. Keely looked over to me as if to say \"why are you still here\" and let me know my order had been placed.. I let her know I had additional items to order, she finished with her regular, and then completed mine. She didn't advise how long or how much, just \"thanks\", and began talking to her regular.   About 25 minutes later Keely brought me the ticket for the order and walked away. I walked up to the bar and asked for the discount due to not being asked for an MVP card as the sign above the bar suggested, and Keely was immediately flustered. I was told dismissively to wait for the manager to come approve the discount.   After receiving the food I noticed some items were missing and let the manager know. Her reply was lacking in empathy, but she had the additional item made fresh, and I left with all my food in hand!  [Time to eat! Nope, time to turn around and drive back to Fox and Hound, and waste your boyfriend's lunch break because your food was made completely wrong]  After getting my order, the second time, I can say the Beyond Meat patties were cooked perfectly, and tasted great with all the correct toppings! The Parmesan fries would have tasted even better had they been hot, but were pretty delish overall.   Sadly, since this isn't the only place serving Beyond Meat this will be our first and last time visiting Fox and Hound.   If you decide to brave the waters, as a tip, order your to-go over the phone so the staff isn't forced into using customer service skills they do not have.   Thanks for reading!",

I decided to go with the Voodoo burger. You guys...this thing is serious. Fresh beef, fresh jalapenos, onion straws and chipotle aioli! The potato bun was a perfect compliment. I loved everything about it. Just the right about of flavor and spiciness.  The fries were just okay for me, I think if they had come out a little bit hotter they would have been really good.   I would definitely come back here to try something else!",

I was impressed. This place is spacious, comfortable, and clean. The food is also greasy but good: burger, Parmesan fries, pretzel bites. The Yuengling beer on tap was good as always. I usually go with Blue Moon, but that hits me harder because of the wheat.   Friendly and efficient service, from the bartender to the waitresses to the event coordinator and manager.   I tried to snag a picture of the private party room, but right when I walked over there, the first person in the party arrived. Then another, and another, and another. I'll sum it up for you: pool table and basketball shooting game. Now that's a freaking party.   Just kidding. Just add beer or wine anywhere and you have a party. It could be in a lawn chair by yourself in the backyard by yourself. What? You never partied by yourself? Oh yes you have.   Anyway, if you're looking for a sports bar, Fox & Hound is legit.",

We tried a new menu item the Guinness onion soup and the Dilema Chicken sandwich. The sandwich was delicious.  I asked for the egg to be cooked hard rather than sunnyside up and changed the cheese to  cheddar those changes made it a tasty sandwich for me. The onion soup was great. The flavor was robust and the cheese was nice and hot melty and stringy. Yummers! We only had coffee and water to drink, but we saw othes with supersized blue margaritas. The seevice started a little slow but it got much better. We miss the Winston Salem location and will travel to the Queen city when we need the Fox & Hound fix.",

    "text": "OMG! OMG! I have not been to the Fox & Hound since the one closed in Winston-Salem! My mind and taste buds immediately traveled back to when a group of my friends and I would find ourselves at \"The Fox\" the first Thursday of every month to enjoy our favorites, mine was the Hot Honey Chicken wings with Bleu Cheese. Present day, we chose to dine here right before the noon hour on a dreary Saturday. It was so eerily quiet and empty, I began to second guess my nostalgic need to taste the Hot Honey wings again. After a wait, we were greeted by the Hostess....who ended up having to be our waitress because the bartender was not having a great morning (yes, it was visible and audible) and they were down a few people. Of course, I ordered the Hot Honey wings with bleu cheese but I also ordered \"The Dilemma\" handheld sandwich because the description sounded so tasty. My Hot Honey wings came and I was like \"YAAAAAY......NOOOOOOO\" because the first one I tried to eat was pink and shiny on the inside, i.e. not completely done. I mentioned it to the waitress and she took them away. No sweat because I have my sandwich coming! Let me share the sandwich description from the menu verbatim and see if you agree....\"Hand battered crispy chicken breast, American cheese, applewood bacon, maple miso butter and a sunny-side up fried egg\". MMMMM! Well I made a few changes, switched out the American cheese for Cheddar cheese and had my egg fried over-medium and that sandwich was AH-FREAKING-Mazing!!!  I was loving up on my sandwich when the manager of the hour came by to explain the wing situation...something about they have a frozen, smoke/flash frying process that causes some of the wings to be pink but he could assure me they were done....UMMMMM, NO! He offered to cook me another order, to which I agreed so I could get back to this love affair between my taste buds and The Dilemma! Overall, the sandwich and the service of the hostess is why we could eek out 4 stars here! Oh and by the way, when I ate my wings later, they were NOT pink!",

When they finally arrived, they were cold. Within ten minutes, the cold ones were replaced with another order of cold brussel sprouts. Never mind our entree was nowhere in sight.  I realize the bartender can't control the kitchen but all we got from her was that she was \"frustrated with the kitchen\". That made three of us.

Ask for drink recommendation and was served in the same glasses I bought at Walmart with a white straw. No drink glass or drink straw..thumbs down. Ordered the boneless buffalo wings, took 20 mins to get the food. It comes out in a stand that you serve fries in. Food was awful, and was more like chicken nuggets. The drink had no liquor in it.  I wont be going back. Its too bad because I have had food there before and drinks and it was decent.  Oh yea, the cherry on top is that Ive had gas for 5 hrs since eating there. UGH!!!!",

(i like when servers say small pints are on special...i thought a pint big or small meant 16 ounces) They have a pretty decent draft selection including New Castle, Old Meck Copper, Shock Top, Fat Tire, Sweetwater 420, and others.  Our first round was slow to arrive. Our server checked on us a lot, but always gave the feeling that she was getting sent home soon, surprisingly she stayed with us the whole time we were there.    The Black Forest sandwich was pretty tasty. Turkey on a pretzel-like bun. The Queso is always a favorite for us here.    They had Tuesday night karaoke, but didn't really have the crowd for it.  i should mention they do have a beer club card and although i don't actually remember what i can get with said card, the combination of their beer special and rewards for drinking beer will keep me coming back.",

Take it from me, I know this. I sell into this industry and visit restaurants all day long. Good clean restrooms=good clean kitchen.  So the place is as dark as dark can get in the middle of the day. All the blinds are closed so TV viewing is best, I guess. Our waitress Emily L takes our order with little enthusiasm but that's ok. 20 minutes later I'm asking where our sandwich and bowl of chili are. She says,\" It will be out in a little while.\" WRONG ANSWER The correct answer is \"I'm sorry, I will check for you.\" I expect hot food to appear in 15 minutes or less - in any restaurant. That's the correct wait time. That's all! Emily L got a $2 tip...and that was generous. Never again.  Or yeah, the food wasn't very good either. There are better places.",

Although our server was nice, she was ill prepared when asked the daily drink specials. I then proceeded to order the chili nachos. We received chicken and chili nachos- a 5$ up charge for both meats. She took a while to come back and ask how it was so by then I just began eating the nachos anyways. I told her we only wanted chili and she had a confused look on her face- I explained both were fine because I was starving but I was expecting too much when thinking she would at least comp the $5 difference. The second beer I ordered was the Duclaw dirty little freak. I have only had this beer once before so when I received it I drank it anyways, not sure of the difference. Once we got the check I found out they must have switched the Dirty little freak to the Sweet baby jesus. I work in the restaurant business so I understand the beer lists are not always accurate but at least she could have told us it would be a different beer. I do have some sympathy because I could tell she was very new or poorly trained, however despite those possibilities, she should have known not to walk over to our table while texting on her phone doing so. I have been here before- and I most likely will return again because who can say no to $2 drafts. Next time I will have to sit at the bar and stare at the taps to make sure they're correct.",

We had a group of about 20 people with one waiter. She we never got any drink refills and no silverware. We had to get up to get our own silverware! But of course she didn't care about giving us service because they automatically charge a 18% gratitude on each ticket since it was a big group. The food wasn't all that great either. My burger was really dry. Overall, I will never go to this place by choice unless someone picks it as an event destination. *THUMBS DOWN*",

We had about 50 people attend.  We all thought that for $20.00 we would have had a pretty decent buffet.  We were wrong.  They had wings, cheese and crackers, chips and dip, fruit, etc.  The problem was that they only put one tray of food out of each of these items.  The food was gone in the first 15 minutes and several people had not eaten.  The majority of my coworkers had to order additional food off of the menu, because everyone was still starving or didn't get to eat at all.  We complained to the manager who told us there was nothing he could do and would not bring out any more food.  I would never recommend having a party of any sort here.  This is not my first time at Fox and Hound at Northlake and I have been disappointed every time.  I will never go back.",

    "text": "Finally, we got some food when we went to watch the game after the Carolina Beer Company brewery tour.  This place was picked solely for the game-watching aspect, but they said that the food would be decent as well.  Seeing as how we got there at 2:30pm, there was hardly anyone in the place.  In fact, I think there were more people in the restaurant than at the Georgia Tech coliseum for the GT v. NC State basketball game that we were watching.  We sat at the long table just behind the bar so that we didn't make any of the staff work too hard to push tables together.  We were prompted waited on for our beverages, but seeing as it was a large group, with all the different cars trickling in, it took a while before the server was ready to take our order.  This is bar food.  It's on the nice end of bar food, with lots of entrees of substance to choose from, but don't be fooled, it's Sysco food that's been heated.  I got the Napa salad - grilled chicken and spinach - and against my better judgment didn't ask for the dressing on the side.  Sure enough, it was coated, the way that many Americans prefer it, as my friends told me.  Jimmy got the brisket sandwich with fries.  The fries were decent, the sandwich looked a little rough, but Jimmy didn't complain (though he rarely does).  Some at the end of the table got the chips and salsa.  The salsa was good, but the chips were starting to get stale.    Jon had the worst time, since he got the chicken fingers, and being Sysco chicken fingers, they were about half chicken and half breading.  Jon doesn't like breading, so he proceeded to pick off most of the breading, mutilating his lunch.    I'd go back for a sports event - there were tons of huge TVs on every wall, but here's hoping that if we're driving all the way to Charlotte, we're going to the actual sporting event, not just going to watch it on TV at F&H.",

    "text": "We ordered two appetizers and two side salads on a Sunday when the place was basically empty and we had to pull aside someone (not our server) to ask where our salads were after about 25 minutes. Then received our food, wings were gross dried out little turds and although my friend liked her hummus I thought it was weird and chunky. I was so annoyed by the indifference of the staff here that I would never go back. Drive a few more exits and go to Duckworths, I mean it",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying that the food is not terrible (nothing interesting or special, but better than wet newspaper.)  The servers are hit and miss, although our last server was actually very good.    I'm giving this place one star because the atmosphere is trashy, loud, aggressive, and dirty.  I went into the mens room, and there was vomit all over the floor.  I told a server, who gave me a nasty look and then ignored me.    So all in all, this is a great bar to watch an MMA fight and drink jaeger till you puke in a urinal, but not so great for adults.",

    "text": "Had lunch here again today.  I think I've been over a hundred times in the last few years and I've never written a review.  Probably because it is never anything stupendous.  Just a good solid lunch spot near my office.  Sandwiches are all pretty good, service very good too.  Very solid beer list although I never partake at lunch.  So if you're around Northlake mall and need a beer and a bite, this is a very safe bet.",

    "text": "I am giving Fox and Hound 3 starts because it is truly hit or miss. The food is always ok ( just your standard bar food from a chain) but the service is what breaks the experience. I work at the mall nearby and like a lot of mall employees the girls from work enjoy going out after work. But it is clear that the service you receive is directly related to the number of drinks you order. If you order bottles of wine your server doesn't leave you alone however, if you are in to have a coke and a meal after a long shift don't expect to find your server for over 30 minutes. Disappointed because I would expect the same service no matter what my bill is this time.",

    "text": "Welp, I live right across the street from  here- I will agree with some of the other posts about this place, basically average menu/ foods found at most chains and service depends on what you get. Many drinks equaled great service, hanging out for a simple bite? Not too attentive. That proved something to me, I haven't ran back to the place because of this. The people seem nice,  they just make it obvious what they're there for... and it isn't you!",
