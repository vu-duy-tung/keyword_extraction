Sure, they all have TVs all around and decent beer selection, but the food has been mediocre at best. That is not the case here. The food is good with big portions and very decent prices, even on local beers where you are likely to pay a premium anywhere else. The atmosphere here is more of a local spot and it's a good change from the overpriced and over done places around here.",

It was one of my fav spots before.. and with this face-lift and with the great track record of the owners (The owner of Picasso's opened DB's!!) in other sister entities, we're off to a great start!  I've been enjoying chicken wings at Picasso's downtown for quite a long time!  In my opinion, they are some of the very best in town.  AND NOW, they are right here in The Fountains at DB's Tavern!  But, you MUST also try the Pizza Rolls!!  They are really good.  On our first visit to DB's we found the wait staff to be friendly and quite attentive!  Notably, other waiters would swing by and pick up/drop off when our primary was busy.  Good job!  I hope that attentiveness continues!  Oh, and they DO serve OMB Copper in addition to several other local brews!!  Several to choose from and a wine list too!  Several TVs located around the restaurant so the chances are that you can catch the sporting event of your choice while dining!  So welcome to The Fountains DB's!  We're glad to have you here!!",

Our table had the loaded tater tots and blue cheese chips as appetizers and they were both very tasty! They had jambalaya on the menu as a special for the night and it was DELICIOUS! My friends were very pleased with their choices, as well.   The atmosphere was great. I don't think there was one direction you could look without seeing a TV, which made it great to watch the football game.   As far as service goes, it was excellent! It was our server's first day working at DB's Tavern. Our table had a number of questions about menu items. She knew the answer to most of them, but if she didn't then she quickly found out and reported back to us and she had nothing but a smile on her face the entire night! She was on top of everything throughout our dining experience. Our glasses never got empty before she asked if we needed more. It may sound strange, but that is an important factor to me when I am dining somewhere. I don't like having an empty glass. Nikki took very good care of us. Oh, and did I mention she did this while the restaurant was absolutely full of people?!  Top notch service and food! Me and a 'few\" of my friends are going back today! Check this place out...you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Welcome to The Fountains shopping center!  DB's is brand new to the Ballantyne area and they have a tough road of ahead them.  When it comes to competing with Stonecrest and Blakeney for business, the pickens are pretty rare.  Having said that, I think DB's is the place to do it.  I'm definitely pulling for them and I will be out supporting.  First of all, because the place is excellent, but it definitely doesn't hurt that the place is walking distance from my house.    Absolutely love the new design of the place compared to how the Stadium bar had things setup because it just so much more welcoming.  The bar is now down on the lower level and is massive.  Plenty of space to sit or slip in to grab a drink.  They used the elevated section as an expanded area for sitting and it really works!  Overall, simply love the new setup.  Food wise, the menu has some nice variety and it will take a few more drop-ins to find that WOW item.  But overall, I really like the selection.  We had the loaded tots and wings.  Well, my friend ordered the wings but he raved about them.  Multiple flavors to choose from and they had \"a perfect mixture of crunchiness on the outside.\"  Monday nights are Wing Night and they offer 25% on their wings.  See you next Monday!  Specials -  It seems that they have a special running for every day.  Check online on their facebook page for updates.  Wing Mondays, Taco Tuesday, half price wine Wednesdays, etc.  Oh yeah... Live music on Wednesdays, too.",

We'll be back to try some different menu items!",

The only downside?  If you get your order to go, triple check it.",

Some of the food is surprisingly good such as the 'salt and pepper' wings and pizza rolls.  The mainstay waiters/waitresses are generally attentive, however can be some issues with the new help, but Maggie seems to get them in line!!

But the expected is done very well! We've tried their Panther Burger, Tavern Burger,  DB'S Angus Salad, Blue Cheese Chips, and have been really pleased.  There are great food specials to try and always beer and drink specials every day.  Prices are very reasonable and portions are very good.   Seating: About 150 or so with seating at the bar, at high top bar tables, and many regular short top tables with padded,  wooden chairs. So can stay for a short time or a long time.  DB's has been very accommodating to our family and goes above and beyond to make sure everything is right.  They are friendly and all the staff are smiling.  Highly recommended for watching a game with friends (large groups or small) or just a stop off for a quick bite. Families are welcome as well as adult groups.   Thanks DB's for great times and ROLL TIDE!",

    "text": "We were craving wings early this evening and went to \"old reliable\" (YELP) for a recommendation in our hood. Up popped DB's Tavern AND Monday's they have wing specials. Off we go..... DB's is a nice neighborhood tavern with lots of room, lots of TV's and a great bar. Unfortunately they no longer offer wing specials on Monday's but, no worries, we wanted wings.  Although a first time guest and somewhat unsure with the menu, our server worked hard to answers a plethora of questions. We tried 3 different types of wings. The wings were large and meaty but very dry as in over cooked. The wings were ordered three ways;  medium sauce (not a Buffalo sauce), Honey Chipotle and Lucifer's Own (charred).   The medium sauce wings were tasteless and very dry. We asked for additional sauce ($1) which can best be described as a bottled hot sauce but not a traditional wing sauce. The onion rings that came with the wing order were greasy and also over cooked.   The Honey Chipotle wings were covered in a flavorful sauce with enough spice but couldn't rescue the dreadfully over cooked wings. Lucifer's Own were anything but devilish. Not very spicy, dry wings that had a decent char that was a different twist.  Note to self re. DB's: no wing specials, wings are anything but special, avoid wings on Mondays, there are 7 different $1 up charge choices relating to wings and the Blue Cheese is blue cheese less! If you're craving wings crave them somewhere else!",

Sweet and spicy! Tip: if you get your wings to go, ask for the celery and sauce in a separate container so they don't get all warmed up (gross).",

She ordered it cooked medium.  It was served exactly as requested.  She gave me a little piece to try (2-3 bites).  The burger would have been great except the meat tasted funny, and it was not seasoned in any way.  Later we both got sick.  The meat tasted funny because it was bad.  I shouldn't have to get my burger well-done to kill the bacteria because the kitchen is not storing and handling it correctly.  I will NOT return to this place; you make me sick, you're done.",

When you walk in it was seat yourself, but most people were at the bar. We decided to sit near the bar and were given menus by the one and only waitress working.   It was mid-day but I think we were the only ones there not drinking wine or beer. This must be a local watering hole because the waitress was basically pushing food instead of drinks to those who were probably there since opening.   I ordered the pizza rolls which is one of DBs specialties. It was well worth it, and easily eaten. My coworker had food-envy and took home my leftovers.   I would definitely bring  my husband here. I imagine it gets really crowded for dinner and weekends as it was pretty busy on a weekday. The food was great and so was the waitress. The only request is actually having another waitress. She was swamped so lunch took a little long.",

However, we went for lunch a few months later and it was a disaster. We stood at the door for 10 min before the hostess acknowledged us, and there were only 3-4 other tables so it wasn't crowded. When we went to order beers, the waitress said they took away the beer list and hadn't printed new ones yet, and she couldn't remember them off the top of her head. It took a good 15 min to get our first round of drinks, and then over an hour to get our food for 2 adults and 2 kids. The waitress kept apologizing and said other servers keep calling out, so maybe there's a management issue there. The food was good and it's a good atmosphere, but the slow service was unacceptable.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to DB's tonight. This was our 5th time going. I'm not sure if they were having an off night, but my wings were terrible. We have not had problems the times we've dined here before. The teriyaki wing sauce was not glazed and did not coat the wings. The sauce was like water and the wings had no taste because the sauce wouldn't stick to the wings. My wing chips were burned and had an after taste. What made it even worse is I told our waitress about the food and all she said was ,\"I'm sorry.\" She didn't offer a reduction on the bill or ask me if I would like anything else in place of what I had. I thought that was pretty sad. I'll be finding a new place to go for wings the next time.",

We were relieved when we saw that there were not only great beer options for my husband, but also a couple vegetarian options here.  After making our order we were told by the hostess that everything was made from scratch! Finally! A homemade black bean burger! I ordered it with the sweet potato fries which had a sauce that was sweet and paired perfectly with the sweet potatoes! The black bean burger was smoky and defiantly freshly made. If there's one thing I wish I could have brought back with me to Florida it was DB's chef!  Thank you DB's for offering vegetarian options that are fresh, not frozen! I would recommend to other vegetarians looking for a sports bar atmosphere to go with meat eater friends!",

We split a burger, which was cooked properly at medium-rare.  Fries were decent.  So all good there.  Then we ordered some wings and one of their sides, which happened to be the onion rings.  The first set of 6 wings were garlic-parmesan, which were fried nicely but had very little flavor.  If I didn't know they were garlic-parmesan, I would have not guessed that.  The 2nd set of 6 wings were honey bbq and they were horrible. They were under-fried and literally had no sauce on them.  It was like eating a fatty wing with nothing on them.  Very disappointing.  The onion rings came out of the kitchen luke-warm at best and were very greasy.  Not a good combination.    Overall bill was like 38$ with a tip and we didn't even have a drop of alcohol.  We will definitely not be going back here any time soon.",

    "text": "I love this place. I lived in the area when DB's first opened and have always loved the vibe of the place (much better than Stadium). I moved to Washington for work a few years ago and recently moved back when that project was completed and was happy to see that DB's was still rocking.  I've become a bit of a \"sometimer\" since I moved back and thought I'd add my thoughts. As ever, the pizza rolls are one of, if not the best things on the menu. The Philly Roll will hands down change your world. The menu was described as updated and the Colorado panini has become a go-to for my lunch visits. The wings are, as always, a high point, even if the consistency of doneness, size of the wings, and how much sauce they have varies greatly from order to order. Sometimes they come out perfectly sauced and other times it's like the cooks in the back thought about tossing them in the sauce and figured that was good enough (you will be charged for additional sauce even if the indiscernible amount of sauce on the wings would make you think they were completely out of sauce). Sometimes the sauce coats the wings perfectly and others most of it ends up in the bottom of the basket. Sometimes they come with celery, sometimes with carrots, sometimes with celery and carrots, and sometimes with nothing at all. Sometimes you take a bite and give it a close inspection to make sure they're done enough while other times it seems as if they dropped the wings in the fryer a week before and they come out as if they were fresh from an archeological dig.  But when everything comes together for that perfect batch, hot diggity, they're the best wings in all of Charlotte.  The Southwest Chicken and Greek Farmer salads are delicious and the buffalo chicken dip is a gem.  Love the fried pickles, too, and the burgers are delicious (Bourbon BBQ Burger is amazing), if a bit under seasoned. Bottom line is that the food is often great, but consistency is a huge issue across the board, with your meal sometimes being the best thing in Charlotte while other times you're left wondering as to whether or not the owner bothered to ask applicants if they knew how to cook before putting them back there.  The front of house staff has always been a high point for this place, even back in the day. If you're at the bar, Alyssa, Odette, and Jimmy are some of the best bartenders I've ever had the pleasure of slinging my drinks and you can't go wrong with any of them. All three were super friendly, attentive, and quick with a drink or to check on us during recent visits even when the bar was full. The servers are great, and our last server, Jordan, was marvelous. Recommend asking if Jordan, Sam, or Joey are working if you're sitting at the tables, as they will ensure a terrific experience. The staff makes this place and we're looking forward to getting to know them all better.  That said, if you get there and your bartender is Helena, just turn around and head over to Hickory Tavern or the new Duckworth's. We've had Helena as a bartender three times and not only was she outright rude each and every time, on all three visits she was either much more interested in cutting up with the staff in the back than in being behind the bar or, when she was actually behind the bar, ignoring all of the other customers present to get some extended gossip time in with a few guys who seem to always seem to be sitting at the end of the bar. Additionally, on two of the three occasions we discovered extra drinks had been added to our check that we didn't order, and while both instances were explained away as \"mistakes\" and fixed before we paid, it hasn't happened on any other visits or with any of the other bartenders or servers. Best to avoid even the possibility in case you forget to check before you pay, and besides that, she consistently short pours your beer by a couple of ounces (not where this place finally wants to find consistency), which of all the items with higher mark ups behind the bar, seems a silly item to short pour.  They don't have a pool table, but they do have shuffleboard, the obligatory golf game, an old school looking arcade game, and one of the digital jukeboxes for entertainment.  Starting from five stars, they lose one for ongoing inconsistency with the food (indicating no apparent concept of quality control) and another for employing Helena, however the rest of the staff more than compensates for her failings and subsequently regains that star:  4/5.  Tl;dr: Awesome local sports bar with a great vibe and awesome staff. The menu is diverse and the food is great, if inconsistent from order to order, and the wait and bar staff are wonderful except for an appallingly terrible bartender named Helena, so grab a barstool (or a table if Helena's bartending) and you'll be all set to watch a game, have some tasty beverages, and enjoy some good food while being taken care of by great employees.",

Everything else is 2 stars.   Just tried to order a burger with a fried egg with runny yolk (does anywhere serve a fried egg on a burger any other way?), and was told that they ONLY do a hard cooked fried egg. Seriously? The place isn't busy enough to have such a ridiculous rule, which is apparently bc they don't take \"special orders\". We ended up leaving, which stinks, since we've been eating here or at Picasso's for 10+ years.   So, if you want wings in south CLT, and no special requests, recommended. Else, there are now a LOT more options in the area for a good burger and a beer.",

    "text": "We are new in town and decided to try DBs. It's definitely more of a bar feel, with a mix of high top bar tables and regular tables. There are a few tables for outdoor seating, but most seating is indoors. There is a shuffleboard game, and you just give your driver's license to the bartender to get the pieces to play.   We ordered our kids the mac & cheese kids meals when we ordered our drinks. After ordering our food (a chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries & a whiskey bbq cheeseburger topped with bbq pulled pork, cooked medium), we waited about 45 minutes until we asked where our food was. Moments after asking our server where our food was, our food came out. The kids food had come out earlier since we ordered theirs first.  My husband ordered his burger with no cheese, and burger #1 came with cheese. We sent it back and asked for it to be fixed. My chicken sandwich was really good. A little while later, burger #2 came out with no cheese....and no bbq sauce on the pulled pork. We confirmed with our server that the pulled pork was in fact supposed to have bbq on it, and it was. She took it back again, and finally came back with burger #3, which was correct.   In the meantime, I had completely finished my meal before my husband got a chance to take one bite of his burger. By this time, the toddlers were beyond restless and ready to go. So he hurried through his meal so we could get the check and leave.   The check came with a quick, \"I'm sorry your burger was wrong\" - nothing was comped or discounted, despite it taking three times to get a simple burger correct.   Although the food was good and my picky eater devoured the mac & cheese, we will not be back. \"Sorry\" doesn't get people to return.",

This place came up on the Yelp app. We decided to head here.  It was early afternoon on a Thursday. There was no one to greet us upon entering. The crowd seemed to be seated towards the front of bar area. No server in sight to tell us where to sit. We just asked the guy at bar and pointed were we seated ourselves. He said he will send a server our way. We waited just a few minutes.  Server was super nice and was attentive during out time there. I ordered the wings basket and my husband ordered the bacon burger. Food did not take long to come out. All of it was great!  The atmosphere is very laid back and has great vibes. TV screens at every angle showing a variety of sports games. It is somewhat dark inside but this is a \"tavern\".  Overall, we loved it! We look forward to coming here more often for tavern grub, cold drinks, and a game or two.",

The waitress was very friendly and helpful. She told us to get the wings and the pizza rolls and they both were good. We got the honey chipotle wings ( which are not spicy they just have a kick to it) , lemon pepper, and salt and pepper wings. The pizza rolls were a good snack as well. The onion rings we got were over cooked and the sweet potato fries were just okay but when you dipped them in the sauce they provided it helped. Will be back if I need something to eat late at night because they are open until usually 1 and 2 am.",

WHAT AN IMPROVEMENT!  A great variety of seating and really love the large high top tables in the middle.  Perfect for big groups or a gathering of friends from the neighborhood.  A few outdoor tables are another great option.  On our first visit the place was busy and the only negative I noticed was the chairs.  They were cheap and kind of flimsy.  But on my next visit they had all new chairs that were really great.   Glad they made the investment in the new furniture.  Its so much more inviting and comfortable.  Each time the food was excellent.  Went in with my kids and they had burgers.  Large fresh patty with a really nice bun.  I had Spinach Salad with Grilled Chicken and other fixins.  Just what my doctor ordered.    On later visits we had wings, flatbread, and recently the PIZZA ROLLS!, Everything was really tasty, cooked properly and served hot and ready to eat.  The Pizza Roll was a really big hit.  Service is how it should be.  Its is a great improvement from Stadium and certainly better than Beantown that was here before that.  Really glad to have the neighborhood bar back and thrilled they have great food.  They should do well.",

Even though the restaurant offers a kids menu, the place is not kid friendly. The place is probably decent if you are looking for a sports pub but as a family destination, not a good choice whatsoever. The restaurant has many TVs, about 20ish or so and the beer selection is good. As for food, the quality is really poor. Besides the kids meals which were your basic items you will find at other \"sports bars\", nothing special. I got a burger which not only lacked flavor but the onion rings were a huge disappointment, the coating was laced in soggy oil and not worth even looking at. The service was rushed and the place was way too loud, even for a sports bar. Maybe we were placed under a speaker but our server couldn't hear us place our order. There are so many other choices for a sports bar experience and DBs would be the LAST place I would even consider going. Save you time and money and go elsewhere. Hickory Tavern, Bradshaws or Ducksworth which are within a few miles away would be better choices.",
