Our server, Kelly, was right on point and very friendly.  The food was good, not as highly seasoned as we would have liked, but enhanced enough to be genuine.  I've never had dark flat falafel but these were hot, crunchy and flavorful so that's a plus. When we return to Charlotte we will stop by for another meal to try some other specialties and because we forgot to order the soup.  P.S: Be sure to drop by and get a drink called The Cocktail to make your commute better.",

Everyone who comes to Charlotte must drop by this place and experience it themselves I am sure they won't be disappointed. There service is also great and they r very friendly.

    "text": "This is probably the worst mediterranean food i had in charlotte.   Here's the BAD  - Poor Service: We had to sit for 10 mins after being seated before the hostess asked asked us if we wanted menu's (I've never been asked if we wanted a menu in a  restaurant...we were always given one). We asked for water and were given bottled water and when we asked for regular water, we were given water cups with something white floating in them.  - Old & Reheated food: The falafel we ordered was 99% reheated in oil. You can make this out because when you gently press on it, oil will ooze out. The chicken had this weird smell like it had been cooked and was sitting in the fridge for a day or two and then again reheated.   - Way to expensive: 4 falafel's cost 4.99+ tax. A small side of plain rice is $5. Although this looks like one of your average mediterranean food joints, the prices are nothing like it. The prices are not indicative of the experience either. Just the opposite.   I literally cannot think of anything good about this place. My wife became sick after dinner.   I am not one to bad mouth a new restaurant but if they have any hopes of doings well, they have to improve all of their departments.",

The food here is amazing and I have yet to try anything I did not like. I personally would recommend the Kibbeh (ground beef pastry) for an appetizer and the lamb chops as an entree. The kitchen here is open until well past midnight, so it makes for a great late night option as well. I would also recommend one of their mixed drinks during your meal, my favorite is the fruit cocktails. They also have a wide array of pastries to try. The hookah here is top notch and they personally ensure every head is packed to perfection and constantly change out the coals and make sure the smoking experience does not degrade over time (as is natural at most places). Their new outdoor seating is great! Grab a coach, some of the delicious food, and a wonderful hookah.",

Since we play cards on Saturday and my friends smoke, we can't just go anywhere. Unfortunately, these guys have yet to learn how to provide customer service. It's been 4 years since I first came here and the same problems continue year after year. The food is mediocre, the hookah is complete trash, the seating is awful and the service is awful. I legit made a yelp account to bitch about Albasha. Example, today, our orders were taken 45 minutes after we came and our food took 30 minutes to make (all sandwiches). Some sandwiches came cold, some undercooked, and the fries were of course stale. But after waiting an hour and fifteen minutes to eat I'm just glad you acknowledged that I'm a customer.  I love the owner and his kids and the workers, but they have deep rooted problems in the way they run this restaurant that probably won't go away anytime soon. I will officially stop my weekly patronage here and look for a new spot until they've, at the very least, fixed their customers service. I'm willing to put up with all their problems if I didn't feel so damn disrespected whenever I go.",

I wanted to give them 5 stars before we were even seated at our table. That's how attentive they were! It has a nice outdoor patio- great for beautiful nights and vibing with friends.   Food was delicious- the most satisfying meal in a while and affordable priced! I think the chefs are from Turkey & Egypt!

Katherine and Michele are the best servers I have seen in my life, they make sure you are satisfied and they keep checking on you every few minutes. The food is good and Michele makes the perfect hookah. They also upgraded the outdoor sitting which makes a perfect hangout place with friends. This is my usual hangout place now and I love being there as a customer.",

By far its one of the best restaurants I've been to that serve authentic Mediterranean food. I was offered a special named albasha Beyti kabob which was a Turkish delicacy. The food and service was amazing. Definitely coming back whenever I'm in Charlotte with friends!",

I tell my gps to take me to this place and as I get closer I am thinking am I in the right neighborhood.. well on the outside and location wise the place looks a little shady but hey we went in and tried it and guess what!!! we left so happy :)  Zidane, our server is the start of this place... so friendly and attentive and amazing personality. I would come back to this place for him. Customer service experience is a big deal for me and they made me happy. Their hookah is much cheaper than other places and is good quality. The most amazing thing on the menu that made my eyes light up was the 'kadak chai/tea'. It is the indian version of tea sold no where in charlotte at a hookah bar. It was amazing and just like how I would make at home. This is very relaxed place so come hang out and just enjoy the food, hookah and low key vibe.",

The service is amazing and they make sure we are absolutely satisfied with the food or they switch it out. My favorite dish is the chargrilled chicken over rice. After dinner we always have tea and dessert. The kanafeh and tiramisu is some of the best I've ever had, and it's all made fresh in the kitchen!! Also another great thing is that they are open late, so it's nice to come straight here after a long day at work and chill in the outside lounge.",

Definitely would go back and order those three items off the menu! The service was really great and the chef came out to check on us, which was a nice personal touch.   If you are looking to try a refreshing drink this summer, would highly suggest ordering the mint lemonade. Wow!! So refreshing, sweet and sour, perfect for a sunny day.   The chicken shawirma on top of my fatoosh salad was okay, wasn't my absolute favorite but wasn't bad either. Needed a bit more flavor so I requested a side of taheeni sauce which really did the trick.  The restaurant itself isn't super fancy or anything but it definitely has a welcoming feel to it. The outdoor seating for hookah seemed spacious and cozy, even though we were just there for dinner.",

Refreshing. 4) Listen to traditional and new arabic music. Relaxing. 5) Keep relaxing and repeat.  Kudos to Michelle, Josh and Deja for running the show and putting up with the customers.

The only downside of this place is that if you smoke outside during the winter, well... it gets pretty cold.   They had plenty of seating for their outside hookah area. If you're here during the summer or spring, it would be perfect to be outside and smoke. However, if it's in the winter, then yeah you might be a little cold as there's no heat outside. Unless, well you bring your own. The owners here were very chill and welcoming which I think would make me want to come back.  I had a cappuccino and that was amazing, and when I paid for my check, I was definitely eying at their desserts it made me think that I should've ordered one. Sadly, I didn't so this is definitely on the plans the next time that I'm here.  All in all, this place is great and I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Dont be fooled on what you see from the outside. The inside is awesome. I was in Charlotte on a mini vacation and wanted to go to a middle eastern place that you could sit down with hookah and great food. Well guess what? I found it. It was on point so much so I went back twice.  The interior is not that great I will admit. But where they lack in appearance they make up for it in food and customer service. We stopped in the first time and only ordered a hookah and some beverages. Speaking of the beverages the watermelon juice was so good. I ordered 2! The hookah was on point as well. The price for the hookah is way cheaper then what I would have paid at home.   The second time that we went back we ordered the chicken kabob with rice. The chicken was so good and cooked to perfection. It was really tender and juicy. The rice was cooked perfectly. The service was  a bit slow from what I saw because there were only two people working but I was willing to look over that because they were really nice and accommodating.   If ever in Charlotte again I will only go to Al-Basha for hookah and middle eastern foods. I would say the same for you. I promise you will not be sorry,",
