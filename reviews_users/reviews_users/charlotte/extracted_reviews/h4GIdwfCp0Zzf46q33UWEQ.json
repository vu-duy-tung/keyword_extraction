I thought the pulled pork was too mushy and bland. It didn't feel smokey or feel like BBQ at all. I was not a fan of the texture.  The ribs were good - tender enough to fall off the bone but still had some bite.  To top it off, we had their sweet tea doctored up with some unsweetened tea so it wasn't too sugary sweet.   Space was clean and airy with plenty of seating.   They had a display with various slices of cake that looked good.  Overall, an average BBQ joint with reasonable prices.",

I'm disappointed they removed online ordering - I called and got put on hold for just under 5 minutes, but still a long time to just be waiting on a silent phone line. Other than that, they've got good BBQ and great side options. I definitely recommend giving it a go.",

Unfortunately, those twelve bottles were long gone.   Fast forward to this past weekend.  I was in town to visit and of course needed a Bobbee O's fix. I went to the old location and of course saw they were gone. A quick lookup on yelp got me to the new spot east enough. Same terrific Q. Same amazing sauce.  Same outstanding service.  BUT a new, comfortable, eat in restaurant!  I was very impressed.  I had the brisket and as usual, it was melt in your mouth tender.  I needed to reload on my personal stock of sauce but alas, they were out!!  Oh no!  But not to worry. The very friendly and helpful manager told me more would be in on Monday. She took my name and promised to call me when it was available. Sure enough, the call came Monday afternoon as promised.  So this time I bought TWO cases!  A former colleague picked it up and shipped to me. Now I should be set for a while. YUM!  Thanks Bobbee and staff!",

We ordered a half chicken and rib meal with mac n' cheese and cabbage and beef brisket and rib meal with mac n' cheese and potato salad. All the sides were good. The only reason I couldn't give this spot a 5 was due to the fact the beef brisket was old and needed to be tossed certainly not served. I'm a foodie so for me I'm on to the next spot but I say check it out..just don't order the beef brisket..",

The brisket was a specially dry and pretty much Blan.  The cornbread was also extremely dry. The best part of my meal was by far the baked beans. The potato salad had bits of black potato in it so I didn't try it.  When walking in a barbecue restaurant on a Friday night at 6:30 you would expect it to be full. There were five people in the place. I must say I was extremely disappointed and unless they change the way they do things will not be coming back.",

I'm giving this place a 4 star review because it's a brand new location and in hopes that they will change their serving style and recognize that their sides are super small..( if you get the individual Mac and cheese side, there are approx 5-6 pieces of penne Pasta in cheese)",

The large sides of fried pickles and sweet potato fries are huge. Fried pickles lack in vinegar flavor, bland. Sweet potato fries were normal.  Macaroni and cheese is delicious and more of a casserole, heavy on onions.  Fed 4 with the family meal.",

After reading multiple reviews, we were a little skeptical but willing to give it a try. I ordered the brisket plate with two sides, fried okra and coleslaw. My BF got the pulled pork plate with coleslaw and baked beans. I also ordered us single sides of mac and cheese and Brunswick Stew to share. It was a lot of food. We did opt for the extra meat which was $2.00 extra, but what we received was what I would consider a regular portion and seemed small to be considered extra meat. Size aside, the both the brisket and the pork were seasoned well and flavorful with a nice balance of fat to meat on the brisket. There are a lot of bad reviews about the mac and cheese but I found it to be really good! It tasted like homemade. Perhaps most of the people who didn't like it are used to box mac and cheese. The fried okra was perfect! The coleslaw was fresh and crisp but had too much sugar. The beans also had a tad too much sugar. And finally, the Brunswick Stew. I consider myself a Brunswick Stew snob, so I was not surprised to find that I did not care for Bobbee O's stew. It was flavorful and spicy but had far more ingredients than I care for. I like my Brunswick Stew a little less crowded. Overall, the food was good. I would order there again.",

I got the pulled pork with ribs. Both were moist. The ribs were ok but the flavor was lacking for me. The mac n cheese and collards were great.   Coconut cake was delicious.  The food deserves a four. The girl who took our order made it a three.  She kept getting confused. Then she forgot to add the delivery fee.",

I tasted it in the car and rushed back in for another slice! It's really really moist and the frosting was out of this world.    It looks really nice in the there and it's very clean.

Not only did she huff&puff, she chucked and sucked her teeth, and even added an \"oh my god\". We canceled our order after being hung up on at least 3 times due to bad service and called back to speak to the manager.

I also order the Brasket salad, added on gallon tea , corn bread and order 20 wings. So my total was about 75.   Okay so I sent my hubby to pick up the food, and he was kinda late because of an accident on the highway. So he got there around 10:45. Well when he got home I was missing my gallon tea, and we didn't get any bread with our order. So by this time they are closed, and I had to work the next day so I couldn't call them.   Well I was disappointed that I didn't get my gallon tea.  But lets get to the food part. The Brasket had no flavor at all but it was moist and tender. The wings was good but it was breaded, but my kids liked them. The sides was pretty good.  The Brasket salad was nothing fancy, it really is just brasket on a bed of salad.   Well that's it, maybe I'll give them another try.",

I arrived earlier than the wesite told me to for pickup, and my order was ready much sooner than projected.   The pork was good other than the fact that it had some spices in it, which I don't care for, but I know some people like that. The brisket, cut thicker than normal, was fantastic. It had the perfect subtle smokey flavor, was really tender, and the sweet sauce they served with it matched up well. In the future, I would just order brisket and forgo the pork. The corn, cornbread, and sweet potato fries were unremarkable. All served hot. It was nice that sweet potato fries are an option, many BBQ places don't offer that choice.   At dinnertime on a Sunday night, it was not crowded at all. There were only a few people dining in. The dining area was clean and spacious, there was also plenty of parking. At $13.17 including tax, this meal was fairly priced given the moderate portion sizes.",

    "text": "The Brisket  I'm disappointed to see that the brisket is somewhat chopped - not fine - and it is covered in sauce. The brisket was overcooked, perhaps the result of arriving at 8PM, but the place advertises open until 11PM. It wasn't horrible, I'd say average. Putting some more sauce on it made it better, but now I'm liking sauce and not brisket.  Verdict: I'll not order brisket next time I come here.     The Ribs  It's ok that the ribs had sauce on them. I eat them wet and dry. And sometimes put sauce on dry rub ribs. But, they were also overcooked; and dry. The meat was too chewy.  Verdict: I'll not order the ribs next time I come here  The Chopped Pork  OK, this turns out to be the best of the three meats. The flavor reminded us of the pork that Byrum General store in Shopton - in Steele Creek - used to serve before they shut down. We liked Bryum's and we liked this. This probably makes a great BBQ Sandwich! Although I'm not a fan of putting sticky type sauce on pork, their sauce was decent with the pork. I  Verdict: I'll order this next time I come here.     The Sauce  The sauce is a thin red sauce that looks like a thin jelly when you first look at it. It is sweet, and not really hot. They say a little sweet and a little hot. probably a little less hot.     The Sides  Sorry I didn't take pictures of the sides.  The best of the sides was the Mac and Cheese, it was a little bit salty but had great flavor and loaded with cheese.  The baked bean just really didn't stand out. They were good, but were like heavily buttered pork and beans without the pork. Dropping some of the brisket and chopped pork in the beans made them much better.  The Sweet Potato Fries were, about what you'd expect  The slaw, we have is a mixed verdict on it. Becky liked it; I thought it had a fish flavor to it. Which if you aren't expecting it...  Bobbee O's is place I'd go to if I were local to the area and didn't want to drive far for BBQ.  Understand that I've eaten at many places that I'll never go back to, under any circumstances.",

So let's get to the mac & cheese cuz come on now...who can really mess up mac & cheese? Ok, apparently they missed the memo because I'm not understanding why you put large onion chunks in mac & cheese. I could've sworn it was JUST mac & cheese. Where in there does it say onions??? It was oily & poor quality cheese then add the onions. I just threw it all away because I was so disappointed in everything . We need to have a moment of silence for Bobbee O's for this.",

I loved the BBQ sauce but was a little confused about the plain bun and bread slice. Toasted bread would've been good. This place was really close to getting at least 4 stars until mid way through our meal, big groups of people started coming in for what we were told was going to be a graduation party. That's fine. We continued to eat until one of the employees (nice young lady) decided to come by our table with a poster and ask if we could stand up out of the booth so she could stand on the booth seat to hang a poster on the window. Huge NO NO. She also let us know that the graduation party begins at 7pm. It was 6:30). No one had the courtesy to let us know that we would have to leave at a certain time.   Around 6:30 a family came in, ordered and sat behind us, after sitting for a couple minutes someone came to tell them that there was going to be a party and they would have to get their food Togo. Very unprofessional.   I wanted to really like this place but this experience left such a bad taste in my mouth. Unfortunately, I will not be recommending to others.",

The wings were large, however, they were cooked either in water or steam causing the skin to become rubbery and distasteful.  It appeared they were tossed on the grill to heat them up, and then slathered 'em sauce.  Not a representation of good BBQ on any level.  Yuck.",

I've visited twice in the last month and both times have been a little disappointing. One of my favorites sides is the mac n cheese. However, recently the flavor has been altered. Not sure what it is. Too much salt or too many other seasonings ruined the flavor. I can't even get my 2 yr old to eat it anymore. Also the collard greens were bitter with large pieces of meat in it. There was never meat in them before. They also omitted one of the sides in my veggie plate which I didn't realize until I got home. Also the corn on the cob tasted old.    I really like this establishment. It's close to home, clean and the staff is pretty friendly. I just think they need to better supervise the prep staff and stick to the original recipes. The food doesn't taste as fresh as it has in the past.",

Cashier that was there had a terrible attitude as she did once before when we went up there. I put my order in first, then he ordered. We sat and waited, then once we got our food, we left,thankfully we did not get far as one of our orders was left out the bag. We drove back up there just for them to tell us that they never rang us up for both orders which is ridiculous because I ordered 1st! So how do you not have the first thing I ordered, but you put in 1 order with no problem. They did not accommodate us in any way nor did they apologize or nothing. Just poor customer service all the way around and I will never ever go back. I loved going here up until now. I will also pass the word on telling people how bad of an experience I had. Just flat out disgrace",

    "text": "Few foods cause as much rivalry, fierce loyalties, and controversy as BBQ.  Like many folks, I love good BBQ, and have my preferences as to meats, sauce, and sides.  For complete transparency, I've been eating 'Q' in various states regularly for almost 40 years, and my favorite is whole-hog pork BBQ with low country SC-style mustard sauce (it's what I grew up with, and to date, I've never had a better style anywhere).  That being said, I respect the other styles/locations, and if it's done right and with love and respect to the meat, you'll get my business.     So...   My girlfriend and I have driven by Bobbee O's many times (and always laughed at the lit neon 'OPEN' sign on the side window that is turned on during hours that the restaurant is clearly not open), and finally decided to give it a try.  We ordered through DoorDash, and the food arrived hot and well-packaged about 30 minutes after ordering (which was around 6:30 pm on a Saturday evening).       I ordered the pulled pork dinner with cole slaw and baked beans, and my girlfriend ordered the brisket dinner with fried okra and cole slaw.  We also ordered a side of Brunswick stew, a side of mac & cheese, and hush puppies as our choice of bread.  Overall, we had a decent first experience (I'd give 3.5 stars if Yelp had that option), with the following pros & cons :       Pros:    *  Almost all of the food looked fresh and had a 'home-made' quality.  I don't know about you, but the last thing I want out of my 'Q' is an industrial-scale, boring chain restaurant vibe.   *  The portion sizes were ample, a good value, and had enough for leftovers.   *  Both the pulled pork and the brisket were moist and tender, and didn't need to be covered up in sauce to be tasty.  But they did not have a massively intense smoked flavor that I've had at other places.    *  The mac & cheese had good flavor, with the addition of a little onion.  It was definitely NOT the 'blue box', and tasted more like 'somebody else's family's recipe', if that makes any sense.    *  The fried okra was surprisingly good, and I absolutely despise okra.      Cons:   *  While the vegetables in the cole slaw looked fresh, appealing, and were perfectly crisp, the dressing was so overwhelmingly sweet that my heart sank with disappointment after the first bite and I couldn't eat any more.  Please watch the sugar !    *  I know deep-fried foods can be difficult to pull off with take-out and delivery, but the hush puppies were not hot, dry in the middle, and seemed almost like an afterthought.    *  The Brunswick stew was okay, not great.  The reason I put it in the cons is that we found not one, but two big bay leaves floating in it.  While I like the flavor of bay leaf, and applaud the cooks for using real spices and herbs, they can be a little weird to swallow, especially if you're not expecting them.       * The baked beans were also a little too sweet for my taste (but nowhere near as distractingly sweet as the cole slaw).  A review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the sauce.  I found the sauce to be neither a pro nor a con.  For what it was, it was fine.  Some people will love it, others will hate it.  It is on the sweet and tangy side of things, and I personally didn't use much of it because I didn't think the meat needed it.  It's not my favorite style, but seemed to be crafted with love, so I can't knock it.  Your results may vary.  My girlfriend and I both remarked that we would like to eat Bobbee O's BBQ again, and maybe try some different items.  The potential for greatness is there with some tweaking here and there.",

    "text": "Pretty good BBQ joint that far surpasses Shane's Rib Shack and whatever else similar that's in the area. I discovered this place thanks to Yelp because I was craving a pulled pork sandwich and was tired of the places that I normally frequent.  Bobbee O's is nestled in the shopping center off Harris Blvd that includes Haverty's, a BP gas station, and Hilton Garden Inn hotel. It has a long table against a wall with bar stools and an open area with table seating.   You can place your order via phone, in person, or by an app. I placed my order in person because when I called, I was put on hold long enough for me to be able to drive there from my job. It was about quarter to 1:00 and the place was pretty jumpin.' I ordered the pulled pork sandwich combo (drink & fries) and my total was $7.03. I failed to check in before I ordered and missed the 10% offer so CHECK-IN TO YELP WHEN YOU ARRIVE TO SAVE 10%.  I waited around 5-7ish minutes and my order came out piping hot. Seriously, my fries were steaming. Bobbee O's earned an additional star from me solely due to the fries. It was a pleasant surprise to learn that they serve seasoned fries. SO GOOD.  The pulled pork was slightly spicy (which I like) and very juicy. They provide you a mini container of sauce that perfectly tops off the sandwich. I was so pleased with my meal and really look forward to coming back to trying everything else on the menu.",

The food was ok but the service was slow with no apology for the long wait-even though I called the order in ahead of time and they said it would be ready in 15 minutes and it took me 25 minutes to drive there and my order still was t ready when I arrived. And what's up with the bread??  I ordered 6 buns knowing I would be charged .30 each. When I checked my order they only gave me 2 buns. When I asked for additional buns I was told by the woman cook  (I've named her the BUN NAZI) said that they can only give 2 rolls per pound of meat ordered and since I had only ordered 1.5 pounds of meat that they could only give me 2 buns. What the heck?!  I was willing to pay extra for all 6!  At that point they graciously gave me 2 more buns and when I said that I was feeding 6 people tonite all the girl at the register could do was apologize and agree with me that this sucked. Wow!  So by the time I stopped at Harris Teeter to buy additional buns (which defeated the purpose of ordering take out to begin with because I didn't have time to grocery shop) my food was cold and my family was grouchy because their food was cold and because it took so long to get home with the the food after the long wait time and an unplanned visit to the store to buy buns. And to make matters worse-I just checked my receipt and was charged for 6 buns all along!  Not sure why they are so stingy with the buns!  Definitely won't be back!  Yep!  This business just lost someone who could have been a loyal customer over a .30 bun!!  How crazy is that?!!!",

Bbq sauce if you can call it that was disgusting. Chicken wings definitely were not smoked. They might be baked but looked boiled as well. Greens were okay and the mac and cheese was good. Overall just keep driving by this place. I'm sure there's much better bbq in Charlotte.",

Their pulled pork is wonderful, while I'm not a big fan of brisket, Bobby O's  is delicious and the people that I have taken there say it's the best brisket ever.  The onion rings are exceptional as are the fries and slaw. If you want good barbeque, go to Bobbee O's ...... my one bad experience was the exception ... not the norm.",

I had the fried half chicken dinner with onion rings, hushpuppies, and macaroni salad.  The onion rings were huge, thick slices and sweet.  They were delicious but not crispy enough for my liking.  The hushpuppies were two-bite nugget size.  I didn't find anything special about them.  It was like fried cornbread and didn't have much onion which I expected from a hushpuppy.  The fried chicken is cooked to order.  It came out hot hot hot and well, I took my meal to-go because it was still hot minutes and minutes later.  The white chicken was served as the whole wing attached to the breast.  I didn't try the macaroni salad because I didn't get a fork/spoon.  I took it home, it was warm by then, and I didn't eat it since it has hard boiled egg in it.  It looked mustardy.  Watch out for bread pricing!  If you get anything but a roll, you pay for it, even if your meal comes with it.  It was confusing to me until it was explained.  There's not much to rate on service because they don't do much.  Order was accurate otherwise.",

To avoid a long wait we called ahead and ordered 2 jumbo wing dinners and 1 wingettes with a side - we were asked for our phone number - given a total and told the order would be ready in 15-20 mins.    Now here is where the fun starts - we get there and guess what THEY DONT HAVE OUR ORDER - she checks checks again and checks again not there but admits she remembers our call.  She asks the cooks do they have a ticket - which they don't.   After ringing our order in again I politely ask what will be done for the inconvenience and - are you ready - she says I didn't have to do anything but I gave you a $3 discount - my order total was $34.97 - so uh let me get this straight I get less than a 10% discount for your mistake and you have the nerve to say you didn't have to do anything. I suggest she comp the lowest meal of our order which would be $7.99 to which she says I can't do that - some conversation ensues between her and the other 2 employees none of which could do anything   So I asked for the manager after all 3 said he was gone and not available - I ask again finally one of the cooks goes storming to the back guess what THEY FOUND HIM Bobbee himself- I explained the issue he asks me for my phone number to look up the order - I remind him the order is not in his system - he's now confused lol - so he says who did you speak to we nod toward the cashier- she admits she took it but don't know what happened he fusses at her then fights with register and finally says I took $7.99 off then tells the cashier to finish the order.  No I'm sorry no anything else I can do no I appreciate your patience since it's now 25 mins later - NOTHING he just walks away! Thanks Bobbee!!!!  We wait another 20 minutes to get our order while every one of the 3 employees ask us repeatedly what our order was!  Down to them putting it in the bag there still confirming sides and whether we had fried wings or smoked or both - AAHHHHHHH   We finally made it home only to find out they got my order wrong!   I will say most of what we had was good.  The greens are tender and full of flavor! Chicken is tasty - Mac n Cheese was oily and they threw in potato salad and macaroni salad - potato salad good macaroni salad not so much!   In the end, what should have been a 10 minute visit was an hour",

I ordered ribs and chicken and didn't even finish my food I ate about 2 to 3 bites of each and threw the rest away! Let's star with the chicken I've never EVER had a chicken thigh that dry I couldn't tell the difference between the chicken and the Togo box also the smoked chicken isn't smoked it was clearly left on a grill most likely the moment they opened and I was there at 6:30pm.  I guess when you order food to eat there they give it to you in a Togo box so it's easy to throw away.... now on to the ribs slimy wet nasty mess of fat and minimal meat and we're cold. Don't waste your Time here.",

    "text": "Good \"Q\".  Can't wait to try the rest of the menu  I originally visited Bobbee O's at their old location on Old Statesville Road before they moved to this location a couple of years ago.  Have tried to visit them at this location several times but for some reason, they were always closed when I tried.  Today I was in luck.  Must bigger and nicer than the small place on Old Statesville Road. Love the wall art and the Jazz feel.  Walked up to counter and waited my turn to order. After looking over the menu, settled on a pulled pork sandwich with Beans on the side which I upsized.  They gave me a number along with a cup for my beverage which I filled myself.  In a few minutes, the Pulled Pork Sandwich came out, nice and hot and wrapped in foil.  Sauce on the side as was were the Beans.  The BBQ is great. Nice and moist with a slight smoky sweetness to it. The sauce was interesting. Not quite a Lexington style and the sweetness was more characteristic of  Memphis style. Starts out with an intense sweetness like molasses but then the flavors blend to give an overall well balanced presentation.  Beans were the one thing I was not totally satisfied with. Their texture suggested that they were not completely done. Still have a crunch to them. Could have been a bit sweeter as well and this is where the molasses would have helped.  Service is pretty much self serve and the only interaction you have is when you order and the guy comes out from the kitchen with your order. Not enough interaction to really rate.  Atmosphere as I have mentioned is great. Nice and whimsical and and artist flair.  Will definitely be back.",

The baked beans were bland, no love were put into them, and my bread was lightly toasted when I told them no toasted bread just white bread.

They offer a various sauces such as hot BBQ, BBQ, spicy, etc. I love the BBQ it's very good when dipped into the smoked wings. I had the Mac&Cheese and yams. The Mac&Cheese is delicious and very cheesy and the yams were just ok. Customer service was great also. I got all of this whole platter for 7.99 plus tax. You cant beat the prices. I also had a Arnold Palmer to drink which wasn't the best I've had but it was okay. I highly suggest this place.",

We had the brisket platters with Cole slaw, macaroni salad, friend okra and French fries and the smoked wings. The brisket was cooked to perfection and melted in our mouths! The bbq sauce was a perfect combination of sweet and spicy! The Cole slaw was one of the best I ever had and I'm a huge fan of Cole slaw!!!! The macaroni salad had a little kick to it which made it different but good different. Okra was just okra but it was good too. The only thing I would have changed was the corn muffin was a little dry to my liking but no big deal it will be Texas toast next time. Smoked wings meat fell right off the bone! We don't eat pork so not many things beside the brisket to try on menu hoping one day they can perfect some beef ribs! I can't wait to try collard greens and Mac n cheese next time! Great experience!",

The chicken was the size of a big pigeon, the yams were of the standard canned variety, not bad but no different then you'd fix for a Tues night dinner, the pickles had a good amount of tasty breading so, I was ok with that. The BBQ sauce was very good. 2nd time) I ordered, brisket, mac & cheese and fried okra, now I asked for extra bbq sauce (cuz it was good) and some ranch to dip the okra in.  The brisket was OK, some spots were very dry and chewy, others very tender but they didn't put enough BBQ sauce on the meat,  the okra were mostly the tops of the pods so they were chewy and the breading was tasteless, it REALLY needed the ranch dressing, the mac & cheese was....um, nope!  WTH was that!!???  Greasy, clumpy, spots of white \"cheese\" and ziti noodles, with onions and bread or crackers in it!!!  Just, nope! They didn't give me the requested bbq or ranch sauces, hell they didn't even give me cutlery or a dang napkin!!!!! So, between the scrawny chicken and the WTH mac & cheese, I'll not be giving them a 3rd try.  Sorry guys, try harder.",

We ordered the Sampler Plate.  Brisket and Ribs were very tender.  Food was good and tasty, good portions and good value. Service was slow and restaurant had no air conditioning today. I think they should have offered a free dessert since our dine in experience was a bit uncomfortable due to no AC!  As a dine in not sure why our food was brought to our table with all plastic to go, plastic utensils and plastic cups. Just something to think about as you continue on.",

It was so good we've now had almost everything on the menu! Love every smoked option from the pulled pork to the chicken. Like the sides too. The mac and cheese is very good; there's a special something in the flavor that I can't pick out. Collard greens are seasoned and fried okra is crunchy. And, Bobbee O's knows how to fry chicken! It's flavored and fried to perfection. It reminds me of home in Georgia! :-) Note to the file though, the chicken is fried to order so there will be a 15-20 minute wait. It's well worth it though!  We're regulars now; Bobbee O's is dangerously close to our house!!",

The food was average. You only get one choice for bbq sauce and it's loaded with pepper. I'm not sure why I was asked to leave a tip when I payed after placing my order at the register, nobody comes to check on you or refill your drinks. Terrible first experience with this place. I think I'll just stick with Shane's Rib Shack.",

Finally I get home and I look at my food, the beef brisket was nasty, I mean really nasty. It was all fat and I couldnt eat it. The fries looked and tasted like something you buy and microwave from the grocery store, I remember the old fries they used to have which were much better. The only thing going for this place is the mac and cheese and the pulled pork.If you are going to expand then properly train your staff and serve the consistent quality of food that the customers are used to eating.

Not only did they welcome us to the establishment, but one employee realized it was our first time and went through the menu with us. He explained what certain items were, what they came with, which sides he would recommend. It was super helpful! Both gentlemen were a delight. The venue is very spacious. It didn't take too long for the food to be served to us. And the food was delicious! The pulled pork BBQ (as a dinner plate) was a little too spicy for my liking. I will probably get it as a sandwich next time. It was still good, though. The employee had recommended the macaroni and cheese side, and that did not disappoint. The employee checked on us to make sure we enjoyed the food, and when we left, offered us a great evening and hoped to see us again. My boyfriend and I will definitely be returning to Bobbie O's. It will be a new staple for us. The prices are very reasonable and affordable as well. The dinner plates offer a lot of food, by the way! (I'll probably just get a combo next time)",

I eat at a lot of BBQ joints and this was the least amount of meat I have ever seen on my \"plate\".  The sauce is fantastic and the Pork had a good smokey flavor.  The brisket was very fatty for sliced brisket.  In fact, it was mushy in spots and was of less quality than I have had even on brisket sandwiches.  The people are great here, but with all the BBQ choices around Charlotte I doubt I would return.",

    "text": "Counter gentleman was very helpful for 1st time visitors. 3 of us had different items to share. Onion rings were huge and cooked just right. I'm not a fan of their fries, but that's not the reason for coming. Coleslaw was juicy and had a great flavor. My spouse said the collard greens brought back wonderful childhood memories of her grandmothers cooking. Mac and cheese was baked to perfection and creamy and very cheesy. BBQ  one word, WOW, 1/4 chicken melts in your mouth. Brisket was tender and full of flavor. I'm usually not a BBQ sauce fan, but I tried it and doused everything with it.",

Guess what they fulfilled my order! I got there 10 minutes after they closed and they still let me in! Great customer service!!",

    "text": "We pulled up on a Saturday night for an early valentine's day dinner and they were dead. We were going to leave but we decided to try some place new and stick with our original idea. Let me tell you, I'm glad we stayed.  The macaroni salad was the best EVER. Baked beans were great. My husband loved the greens and I agree, they were spot on. Brisket was so moist and the ribs and chicken were both fall of the bone and flavorful on their own without sauce. Lastly, I agree with their motto that 'it's all in da sauce' because the sauce is slap yo mama good with a little kick at the end. We live 40 minutes away but we'll be back for sure.",

    "text": "Was looking for Texas style bbq this place says it's all in the sauce Texas style u only put sauce on if your trying to hide some thing.  But for Carolina style flavor good big servings hard to beat only complaint ordered a rib sandwich but it still had the bones ?  Had to pull apart to eat !! If I wanted to fight the bones I would have ordered a rib plate. But over all good place just a different style than I like",

The beef brisket was great, the spicy mac salad was just that: spicy (and yummy) and the cole slaw was the perfect kind of sweet. I was not particularly fond of the cornbread muffin though. Eat here soon if you want great Que!",

Took the kids to dinner anyway...we had the baby back ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and pulled chicken, plus Mac n cheese, Cole slaw and fries.  It was all super tight, especially the pulled pork and ribs.  Bobbee, you've got a new regular.",
