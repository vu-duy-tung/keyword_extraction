That said - the staff is really really nice and the patio rocks! They typically have great live music in the summer time in the open air. The food is descent and the kitchen is quite accomodating. Parking is a bit limited but there are several bars on that street that you can visit within walking distance, as well as a bowling alley.  If you do descide to check it out make sure to say hey to Vita!",

It truly tasted like fried breading and on top of that, they were cold.  SO disappointing because I love fried pickles!  Also got the Tree Hugger Veggie Burger, which is a homemade concoction that looked like it had been scrambled and then placed on the bun (rather than in patty form) and absolutely smothered in mozzarella cheese.  Should have been called a mozzarella burger instead.  No tomato, no onion, just one very thin piece of lettuce on the bun.  Very, very unsatisfying, especially since this \"burger\" cost $7.49.  It came with a choice of sides, which were several different varieties of fries.  I chose garlic fries, but that isn't what I received.  Their beer \"special\" is $2.50/bottle, which is just okay, certainly not a drawing card.  There are many other places with much better food that have better specials than that.  The service was \"acceptable\" but nothing more.  My bill was $22 and I ate less than half of my food and left sort of feeling as though I had just been robbed.  At least the beer was cold.",

Overall, I would not go to this place unless you are meeting someone for some game watching.  Even then, don't drink too much because the bathrooms are disgusting.  For months I've seen the same broken faucets, toliet paper dispensers, and even missing mirror!  Whoever the owner is..Target sells them for like $10.  Invest in a decent wait staff and non-\"porto-potty\"-like bathrooms, and maybe people would like to frequent AA more often.",

Outdoor seating, cheap prices, pretty good service.  We had a sweet little thing named LA who successfully deflected all of the pickup lines from the married men at the table next to us while keeping a smile on her face.  Impressive.  You go girl - extra points for her.  The food was nothing to rave about, but the hand cut fries were on point.  They typically have some live music (90's covers mostly), girls that are just tipsy enough to not walk a straight line, guys in pastel polos & khakis, and pounders... lots and lots of pounders.  On a weekend night this place is wall-to-wall people.  Cornhole in the parking lot.  Within walking distance to lots of other bars & restaurants.    Overall, not too shabby!",

We would go there, but always regret it after mediocre food, lunches taking 1.5+ hours, and the least helpful servers around.   One Friday a group ventured to the Angry Ales patio. Another regretful experience that spiraled into what I could only call 'near death weekend.' Angry Ales infected 19 of my friends including myself with the Norovirus . Take food poising and amp it up 10x and that's what you can expect from the Norovirus. Thirty Six hours of pure pain, vomiting, a fever, and other flu like symptoms.   All of us filed complaints with the health department. The inspector went out and confirmed multiple reports of the Norovirus being spread from a cook.",

Some with tables, some with bars, some with pool tables.  Great for mingling in crowds.  In college.    We had a coupon for Angry Ale's so decided to give it a try, hoping to find a new local favorite bar at which to hang out.  It was a nice evening, so we sat outside.  They have a big outdoor seating area, but AA was seriously lacking any atmosphere.  No color, no theme, no spark.    The service was a-ok, as was the food.  Nothing stood out.  It's your basic bar food -- apps, salads, burgers, wings, sandwiches -- but they had a pretty good variety of each item.    Maybe if they did something with the look and feel of the place, Ale wouldn't be so Angry?",

The food was decent, actually probably better than I remember, probably because I had no fork or napkin, kind of hard to eat buffalo bites without at least a napkin (especially after touching the dirty tables).

The food is good- no complaints. We've gotten the nachos, pretzel bites, burgers, ect. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because sometimes the drinks don't taste as alcoholic as they should be lol !! I asked for a double rum and coke, but it tasted like a single. But no big deal... It was on special.",

Location helps too... it's located off of Montford so it's pretty easy to walk to after some bowling or drinking at the other \"hot\" spots to go to.  A good bit of space inside as well on the colder, not so nice days to be inside.  Tons of TVs to catch sports games and a variety of menu items to keep the drinking stomach fueled and ready to process more alcohol... or whatever spirits you deem worthy.  The parking for AA's is like other places on Montford, a bit of a challenge.  Never-the-less on the street parking never fails, and there is a decent size lot around the place.  Don't park at Andrew Blairs for fear of towing (if in doubt, look for the signs).  Had some decent half priced wings on Saturday afternoon on the deck.  The atmosphere and quickly prepared wings with some extra wing dipping sauce made my afternoon complete.  You can imagine the night I had... since I left my credit card in the bill-fold.  Luckily I called the next day and it was waiting for me behind the bar after some photo ID checkage.  I did take my \"walk of shame\" back to the car the next day since I was not coherent enough to remember to get my card after paying the bill.  We'll blame it on \"forgetfulness.\"",

I have a friend that went to Queens University and he suggested I try Angry Ale's. He's never steered me wrong, except for the one time I should date a girl just so I could be eskimo brothers with his friend...not the best decision on my part. There was also an occasion where he said I should do just 3-4 more Jameson shots and I woke up on a bathroom floor. Happy New Year to me.  I went in for lunch and ate the pulled pork burger in about 2 minutes. It was delicious and the 5 local beers I had with it hit the spot. The bartender was extremely nice and didn't even throw me out of the bar after I mentioned the friends name who recommended it to me. Apparently he built himself quite the reputation during his 4 years down there.",

Orders come out wrong, etc.  Last night, a group of us went to Ales to watch the game. It probably took the waitress 20 minutes (not joking) to greet us. She seemed flustered and even without us having to say anything, she told us it was her first night. Ok management - maybe its not a good idea to have a girl start on a night where the city's professional football team is playing in a prime time game. But even then, they weren't THAT busy.   It probably took our appetizers AT LEAST 30 minutes to be brought out after we ordered them. We could never find our server to ask for anything. It was just awful.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying I'm giving Angry's 2 stars even though I've been there a TON and still plan to go quite frequently.. (it's like 3 minutes from my house, let's be honest - I'll be there again)  Positives: Has all the games, lots of TVs, almost always has a good crowd, decent drink specials, decent food, great outdoor seating area. Perfect spot to catch a game and a beer/quick bite. Decent amount of parking, good location near Park and Woodlawn.  Before now I would have seriously complained about the smoke issue, but with smoking no longer permitted inside, Angry's is a much better spot.  Middle Ground: Hit or miss service. Can be great or can be awful. Just depends on the waitress and the day.   Negatives: Constantly changing their menu. They were known for their mac and cheese - gone. Entrees constantly coming and going. I don't know if there is management issues but the menu and wait staff never seem to be the same. Only the guy at the door..   Kinda weird set up. It's divided into 3 rooms and then an outdoor area. Which would be good I guess if you had a group and wanted an area to yourself, but it's hard if the group is particularly large or if your group is in a room and you show up late and it's just impossible to fit another chair.   I would say the biggest negative is if you did not or do not go to Queens or UNCC, the people are probably going to annoy you. Young crowd that can get obnoxious at times (and I'm in my 20's so it's annoying enough to bother someone in the same demo). Very \"Greek friendly\" aka FRATastic! Clearly a flip flops kinda bar but the girls show up in their heels and pearls anyway.   All that being said.. it's not a bad place. But when I read \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" it just seemed to hit the nail on the head.  Foghorn Chicken Wrap is good... if they still have it on the menu? Good pizza, awesome potato skins (but I'm pretty sure those are gone now), Granny's Fried Chicken Salad (something like that) is really good. I'm almost afraid to recommend any food, but most likely it won't be there if you choose ot try Angry's out. (Seriously)",

The inside is decent but not overly spacious, and can get pretty crowded and definitely smoky in a hurry.   A smaller seating area exists to the right of the bar area, and a single-table pool room leads to the patio, which sports its own bar to alleviate the need to take on the crowd to get a drink.  Thursday evening seems to be the time to experience the True Ale's crowd, which ranges from scantily-clad socialites to volleyball and softball teams looking to relax with a pitcher or four.   I've only eaten here once, but I recall the menu as being largey burgers, sandwiches and bar food, but faily extensive. They do serve until 2 am though, which is great.   Toss in live music on some Thursdays as well, and its a decent place to spend a summer evening.",

    "text": "A good, solid place for multiple occasions.  I have been to Angry Ale's on multiple occasions at different times during the week.  I usually go here on a weekend night to let loose after a long week, but have also been here for a few afternoon drinks and lunch/dinner.  I am not sure if Angry Ale's is trying to market itself as a restaurant that serves drinks or a bar that serves food.  If it is the latter, then they definitely have some of the best bar food around.  It is a very diverse menu that goes beyond the traditional burger and chicken fingers that seem to be the flagship items of most bar menus.  I am a little mixed on attending this place during the winter.  One of the great things about Angry Ale's is the outdoor seating, but it is not too much fun when it is 20 something degrees out.   Needless to say, this is one of my go to places during the spring and summer months.    On weekend nights, Angry Ale's seems to attract a college and just out of college crowd, which is right up my ally, but might be unappealing to others.  During afternoon hours, it is sparsely crowded with alcoholics with very entertaining stories and other locals who are just looking for a chill spot to hang out. The pool tables are a nice outlet for entertainment if you are looking to pass some time.  Overall, I would recommend Angry Ale's to anyone of my age and lifestyle.",

Angry Ale's has lots of TVs to watch sports and a \"high tech\" shuffle board that keeps score electronically. Pretty advanced. What isn't advanced is the service. Our server, while she was very sweet, seemed to have misplaced our table and we had to wait a while between beers. Angry's seemes to be short staffed and, according to my local friends, this seems to be a constant problem. The prices and variety of bar food and beer makes up for this. Another good thing is the patio. Lots of room to escape the smoke. Just be sure to let the server know where you're going.",

Ordered the PCP burger - with pimento cheese, fried pickles and bacon. The burger lacked taste..could only distinguish the bacon..everything else had no distinct flavor. The French fries were overcooked and soggy and had a slight taste  of fish.. No kids menu so ordered them sliders. The sliders had better taste..which leads us to think that the sliders are fresh made and the larger burgers are frozen. Hence the lack of flavor on the bigger burger. Family consensus is go back to Five Guys.",

    "text": "I have gone to this bar a few times and each time I've gone there have been issues. The worst came a few weeks ago when I attended  a friends \"going away\" party. We got in and set a table, the whole nine yards. We all got food but it wasn't until a plate of some sort of fried chicken was delivered to our table that I cringed. Halfway into her bite, a friend noticed a beetle looking bug about the size of a penny in her chicken. She scraped it off thinking there was no way a bug that big could have made it, but alas, it did and she was lucky she didn't bite into it. We showed the waitress who then took the food back. That's it. No apologies, nothing.  We then barely saw her again but when we got our bill.  Upon leaving the 3 of us who had ordered food all felt sick. I spent  the next two days throwing up and so did my boyfriend and a the third person who ordered food. Seeing as how we each only got single drinks, alcohol intoxication was out of the question.  When we got home we realized that not only us, but several others sitting with us had been charged for extra drinks. When I called up to discuss things with the manager, the lady that answered informed me I must be wrong, because that waitress wouldn't deliver us bad food. The manager then said the same thing, denying there could be a bug because he \"inspected\" the kitchen the day before and we must all have gotten sick a different way.  This was followed by 10 minutes of us going back and forth with him saying that he would refund the 5 dollars for the extra drink. No real apologies, or decent customer service. This place is disgusting.",

And in my pursuit of happiness and the perfect burger, I decided to step in and try it for myself.    I like to buy groupon or living social coupons just for reasons like today. My wife and I walked in about 1130am and there were a few patrons at the bar. Waitress shouted across the bar, \"you can sit anywhere!\". Nothing like being greeted in an kind and hospitable way. Our waitress was friendly enough.     I asked for the beer special, a 32oz \"\"Blue Moon\" and it was brought out promptly in a large plastic cup. Not cute to me.     For my burger, I ordered the \"Angry as Hell\" and it did make me angry as hell, because it was not good at all.    My wife ordered the big kahuna and it was underwhelming. Very small and she didn't even finish it. She did enjoy her fries she said.   Another first and last.",

    "text": "I wish, I wish....  I wish #AngryAle's lived up to potential that oozes from its glamours and amazing patio area.   I wish all the hype and noise you hear about this place around the Charlotte area was more than just noise and hype.    I wish I liked this place more, but the undeniable fact, that I keep tucked away in the back of my mind, and that I only admit when I am writing yelp reviews at 2:00pm on rainy Monday afternoons, is that this place is a cool, hip, and popular, disappointment.    What exactly makes Angry Ale's a disappointment?  First, the service.  I've been here a hand full of times and I have NEVER had what I would call good service while seated at a table, either inside or out.  I've sat at a table on the patio area and waited for what seems like an eternity for a waiter or waitress to take my order.  There's been times when I simply refused to wait any longer and migrated to the bar.  The only hope you have of every getting a decent level of service is to sit at the bar.  The tables might have salt, pepper, and napkins sometimes not.  Sometimes there will be ketchup, sometimes not.  Too often, disorganization and slow service are the thoughts I have when I leave Angry Ale's.    Then there's the food.  Every time I look at the expansive menu, I see countless things that I want to try, and that seem like they would be really good.  Unfortunately, they  rarely taste as good as the menu describes.  Take the Big Chuck's Nacho's, for example.  Not very good.  Chips were really soggy, wasn't really hot, and the chicken didn't have much flavor (hence the need for salt and pepper).  In its defense, I can say I've had the Chicken Bacon sandwich at Angry Ale's and it was pretty good, just not close to great.   Cool bar, with an amazing patio area.  Service can be described as uncaring and lackadaisical at best, and the food is only slightly better.",

A family member flew in from out of the country to visit me and we were not allowed to go in because she did not have an \"American ID\". She's a tourist? With a valid visa to be in this country but the bouncer simply said im sorry you can't go in we only accept American Ids. I asked to speak to the manager but he was too busy to come out? To me this is discrimination, how would you feel if you're in France and cannot go in to a public bar because you only have an American passport and not a French ID. This was the same scenario for us. Before this incident I enjoyed going to Angry Ale's for lunch or drinks. However I do not support discrimination or racism therefore I will not go back to this place and incidents like this should not be swept under the rug this is why I went to the trouble of writing this review.",

When i was able to flag down a waitress, I ordered a burger (someone suggested the Carolina) and the sweet potato fries. And a PBR, because it seemed appropriate.  The kitchen was able to fast track my burger so it showed up at the same time as my friends. The Carolina is seriously messy but it's loaded with fatty meaty greasy goodness.

You might even have to get up from your table to get your own drink.   I will say the food is good though and that buffalo chicken dip is fire",

Just keep in mind, that on game nights, it does get really loud.   The staff is nice. Also keep in mind on game nights the wait staff are not as quick to serve you. They also keep the televisions quite loud. They have great drink specials.",

We are pretty much creatures of habit here. My boyfriend always gets the mac and cheese with steak, bacon and jalapenos. He loves it and never wants to try anything else. I stick with the buffalo chicken wrap. My favorite sauce for the wrap is the hot honey (or is it honey hot?). I've tried different sides but my favorite is the homemade chips. They are cooked to order and can be just as crunchy or soft (which I prefer) as you'd like. The portion sizes are huge and we've never been able to finish what they give us.   Fancy? Nah. But tasty and consistent? Yes. Therefore, it's a win in my book.",

    "text": "12/4/16 Great wings and I'll admit it and eat my words, it's a Packers spot to watch the game. My original review was based on preseason which wasn't completely wrong but regular season the fans come out to support America's True Team. With that being said, AA is a cool spot to watch the Packers. I was contacted by someone on Yelp saying it's a Packers bar, so I felt the need to update my review. I stick with my review in part of the NC Panthers love this spot as well but there is a dedicated Packers room but they should deck it out in Pack gear and truly support the team. The room is always Pack only so I've officially dumped Blackfinn in Ballentyne for AA.  Blackfinn was cool but sometimes I need to curse when the boys are playing bad and Bkackfinn is a family spot.  Original: 8/12/16 NOT A PACKERS BAR!!!! It's a Panther's bar.  Not one Green Bay Packers anything on the wall just nothing. They claim to have a Packers section and that's BS, I saw more Panthers crap than anything.  Go Pack Go, still trying to find a True Packers home, the hunt continues.  Now my personal feelings aside, their bartender was attentive and I enjoyed the diversity here. Their outside patio has several wide screen TVs and a full bar. I didn't get to try any of their food but the folks there looked to have enjoyed the food. My main reason for going was bc they said they were a Packers bar. I'm going to give Angry Ale's another try during a regular season game just so I get the full experience.  To any Packers fan reading this, Blackfinn in Ballentyne has agreed to host all Packers game and currently working towards becoming a Packers bar.",

And then continued to walk away after we asked if we could order a drink from her. Our appetizer also came after our meals did. Our server didn't even know who ordered what at our table and told us after 20 minutes of waiting for the tab that \"it'd just be easier for her if we would split the bill in half\".",

It took over an hour for someone to finally tell me that the only tv we could turn it on is the one where no one could see it.

The bar specials are pretty decent (Thursdays 32 ounces of a variety of beer, Blue Moon included for $4), but the bar gets so crowded it is a liability to walk around with a beverage. They also have a single bathroom for women which is never enough especially for a bar this size. The inside of the establishment always seems unnecessarily dimly lit as well.  The menu, however, does offer a good selection of food for a very reasonable price. My favorite entree is the $9 protein plate - chicken skewers, zucchini with onion and spinach sauteed with tomato.  I love that this bar has a healthy option that does not involve paying $$ for a bag of salad mix like many other bars. And this way I can feel better about downing my 32 ounces of beer.   I also love that they allow pets on the patio and they brought out a pitcher of water just for our dog.",

I sat down by myself on my lunch break and was waiting to be greeted but it didn't come until a couple came and sat directly behind me and THEN a waitress sauntered over, I completely understand having a large lunch rush and I have no problem with waiting but what really ticked me off was the fact that she came over promptly and greeted them and said nothing to me as if I wasn't there. And then happened to look back at the table and then see me and just said \"I'll get to you in a few minutes,\" reassuring isn't it ? Not at all.

While standing near the next scuffle our drinks were spilled all over us and we were shoved during the process. When I attempted to share my concerns and frustrations with the manager he told us that we can just get the fuck out and that he didn't have the patience to deal with our problems. After paying for multiple drinks this is not how I was expecting to be treated. If you want to be treated with an ounce of respect do not go to this bar.

It has the right consistency and has the right amount of ingredients. I have had spinach dip with too much artichoke, but this is perfectly balanced.

I was coming from out of town and wanted an easy way to get some bar food for the party.  When I went to pick up the order, I went to the bar and paid and they kindly offered me assistance to carry the food out to the car.  So far so good.  Unfortunately, as I was unpacking the food at the party location I saw that one order was missing and three orders had the wrong side.  The food was fine but I made the mistake of ordering items that didn't hold for very long in to-go containers.  Nothing was crispy and the food got cold quickly.  I reached out to the restaurant through a link on their website to see if they could give me some of my money back for the incorrect order.  It's been a few weeks now with no contact.  My experience was disappointing to say the least.",

We typically sit outside and never have a problem getting a table. The staff always brings water out for our pup which is a nice touch.   Most recently we came on Sunday for some Bloody Mary's. On Sunday the mimosas are on special (I believe it is $3 or $12 a bottle) and the bloodies are $5. Their Bloody Mary's are simple but very very good. Not sure what mix they use but it works.  All the food is pretty decent. This past Sunday we just got a side order with fries. They have the good ranch, btw. However, I also like their pickle chips, protein plate, and burgers.",

One of my favorite things about this place is the patio area, it's huge! Plenty of seating and TVs to watch for any kind of sports you want, and the inside is always nice and filled with great service. It's one of my go to spots in that area and recommend you check it out for a great time.",

They did do a nice renovation/makeover.  The patio is gorgeous with lots of seating so they are dog friendly should I want to bring your fur baby.  We took advantage of the happy hour specials.  All appetizers between 5pm-6pm are $5 and between 6pm-7pm are $6.We ordered a couple of things off the menu to share.  First off, we split an order of wings.  Those must have been he wimpiest chickens to roam the area.  There was BARELY any meat on the bone.  (wings are not part of the happy hour special)  We tried toe totachos which is basically nachos on top of tater tots.  I don't know why we ordered it but it didn't taste good.  Tots were soggy and there really weren't many toppings on the tots.  We did enjoy the eggrolls.  I didn't know about the corn and my friend doesn't like cilantro but they were our favorite thing we sampled.  Look, Angry Ale's wasn't a bad experience.  The waitress was great and they had good drink specials.  But...  their food is really lacking.  Everything was bland and we actually left still hungry because the wings were so tiny and we were unable to enjoy the totachos.  I doubt I will be back.  There's so many other restaurants that have better food on Montford so I think I will stick with them.  Also, just be aware this is a Packers bar so don't come here to watch a Panthers game when the Packers are playing.",

When we got home we realized we got (terrible) nachos and only honey mustard wings. We do not typically complain but the nachos were not edible at all. They were stale and tasted like they had been sitting out for a while. I called and spoke with Nina who informed me that it was my fault the word tatcho sounds like nacho and it was trivia night so I should've expected my order to be incorrect. I will not return to this bar due to the way this issue was handled with Nina. She did not offer to help or for me to speak with a manager, she seemed extremely bothered by the phone call and uninterested in solving the issue.",

Some waitresses are great and some barely acknowledge you. I did hear that there were some renovations so I'll have to check it out when I have a chance.

Finally just cancelled the order.  She was also MIA during the game so reordering drinks took forever.  Before Ales remodeled we didn't experience these issues. We left at halftime.   Went across the street to Carmella's to finish the game and the waitstaff was much more attentive and we could hear the games. Our order was right and beer was ice cold.

My personal favorite time to go to AA's is in the afternoon to grab a drink outside and watch a game. The patio is dog friendly, which is a big plus for us as we often walk over with our dog from our house. Draft selection is decent and the food is what you would expect with pub fare. My favorite are the 'tot-chos' - better known as nachos with tater tots substituted for the tortilla chips. There is a reason why it has been around so long, definitely worth checking out!",

At one point, I mentioned to the server about my legitimate service animal (that was wearing her vest) and she said \"yeah, I'm lying to my apartment complex about mine too.\" The service was HORRIBLE - wasn't checked on at all, took about 20 minutes for a beer, and at LEAST 45 minutes until someone asked for our order. The food was great, but the whole process of getting it? And the service? Terrible. On top of all of that, I nicely asked to speak with a manager and kindly told him it just wasn't up to par with what we were expecting, to which he agreed. Nothing was compensated, nothing was done to fix the service. When they ran my card, the charge showed up FOUR TIMES and when I showed the manager the charges he said \"it was declined on our end.\" I then responded and said I would go get another card for him, but this would be the last time I'd be there and that I would let everyone know of the horrible experience I had. So DO NOT recommend this place. No compensation, follow up, anything.",

    "text": "On recent trip to Charlotte, I found myself at Angry Ale's on no less than three separate occasions.  Away from my home turf on the recent Nuggets playoff run, I found AAs a go to spot to watch the game.  The staff and crowd was friendly and accepting of my explicit Nuggets fanship, as I was clad in a jersey and not without boisterous comments.  Also, I made it here on Wednesday for trivia night, which was awesome.  I am a regular trivia geek at Woody's Pizza in Arvada, CO...thus it was quite interesting to be exposed to a different format.  I found the competition stiff, the questions written with wit and intelligence, and the overall experience quite invigorating.  Finally, on this most recent trip to AAs I noticed how friendly the wait staff is.  They truly do epitomize a sense of Southern Hospitality that is difficult to find elsewhere.  Lindsay is awesome!",

No matter if you want to come here to grab a drink and chill or go for a full-out meal, Angry Ale's is awesome.  My husband and I routinely go here once or twice a week, and we've never - NEVER - been disappointed.  The service is fast and friendly.  The prices are fair considering the quality and amount of food you get.  Drink specials are AWESOME, especially on weekdays.  Haven't been for the trivia yet but I plan to!  The food is STELLAR.  Get one of the burgers - any one will do - or some Redneck Fondue.  The fries are great, crispy, and the salads are pretty rockin' as well!  Best thing, for us, is that we can bring our dogs on the patio.  We have an elderly Golden retriever who loves her weekly trip to Ale's (as well as some occasional cheesy fries).  :)  An all-around great neighborhood grill that I'd recommend to anyone!",

The night we went, they had two alcohol promoters giving our free alcohol, so our tab was nice and cheap even with everyone enjoying their fair share of booze. They have local beer and lots of drink specials, even on weekends, which is a plus. They had TVs showing March Madness, a nice outdoor area for warm nights, and servers that came to your table so you don't have to fight for a spot at the bar. Not the kind of place that would become my favorite bar, but just fine for a few drinks with some friends.",

    "text": "Yes, I have become one of those sports league people who hang out here after a game.  Quite frankly that free pitcher of beer (Angry Ale's partners with the league organization) is the highlight for us (look... it's our first year and we don't \"suck\" per se, we just haven't quite figured out how to win yet, haha).  There's always a decent crowd for a Tuesday night.  One reason is music trivia, which is fun if you like that kind of things (winning free beers and gift cert can be motivating).  However, it's loud, and they play inside and outside so there's no place to hide.  The most disappointing thing of this place is the service.  It's fine when you're with a group of friends, or watching a game, not in a hurry and just enjoy being there.  But if you want to order food right away because you just broke out of prison starving, or if you want a cold beer PRONTO because... heck that's why you are at a bar to begin with, well, good luck buddy!  My advice: go up to the bar and do it youself.    Food/drink are your typical neighborhood bar offerings.  On Tuesdays they have $1.75 silver bullets (Coors Light). Tater tots are awesome (I had the loaded one as well... I wasn't too impressed, the melted cheese was just there on the top, not evenly distributed).  I just tried the Ale's Burger, which has fried egg along with 1 onion ring, lettece, tomato, cheese & mayo (I skipped the pickle).  It was pretty good.  I ordered the small portion (1-4oz pattie instead of 2) and it's plenty for me, $6 for a burger with tots.  Before the fire, they had the most awesome onion rings, I haven't tried it yet since they re-opened.  I give it 3-star instead of 2 simply because I do like it enough to keep coming back.  It's a good chill spot on a street where drinking has become a little high-end.",

Or maybe it is because you got a mixed drink here that tasted awful?  That is why I am...well, I guess more bummed than angry.    Atmosphere -   college kids, softball leagues, occasional trouble maker, red and lots of black paint, same setup as before, cool deck area w/ TV's, pool area (fyi, not for swimming).  Food - I ate here pre-fire and the food was okay bar food, as in I loved their tater tots.  They were really good tots.  I have not eaten here since the renovation.  Drinks - This review is on the drinks, which when they were of the mixed variety were bad.  I am not sure what was wrong.  Maybe the syrup mixture was off or the bartender was off.  Whatever it was, the mixed drinks went down like broken glass.  Speaking of breaking glass, that is not a problem here.  The cups and pitchers they serve in are of the plastic variety, which is probably a good thing when a rowdy softball group shows up after a game.    Price - I forget...it was either the same or cheaper than Brazwells.  So you got that...  Overall - I would come here for the drink specials, as in domestic beer drink specials.  As for anything else, I am not sure about that because I would not want to make you...bummed.",

College Kid Review: Man this place rocks pitchers of beer galore- plastic cups oh my! When drunkenness sets in there is nothing to break! Lots of younger twenty somethings where you are bound to meet someone new and makes lots of noise. A plethora of TVs for numerous college sports viewings and cheapish bar food tops the list. When the weather is nice the large outdoor patio can be used as a giant outdoor party.   Anyone else other than a college kid review: Two words to describe this one: scary larry. One of my coworkers got sick from the wings. I don't recommend it if you have some expectations. This place serves your typical sub-par bar food. The same goes for the drinks. My review may be skewed because once someone I know gets sick from the food is warrant enough for me to stay away. The only positive I can see is the large outdoor seating area which is why I gave two stars instead of one. If you go there good luck and lower your expectations.",

Went there recently to watch the Wisconsin game and after about 2 minutes we figured out the spot and the waitress was kind enough to change the the TV for us. Wasn't too busy, which was a nice change as some bars on game day just get ridiculously busy and it's hard to get good service. That said; it wasn't slow by all means, just a good crowd.   Ordered the chicken nachos, which were OK. Came on separate tortilla chips with all the fixings. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but when I think of or want nachos, I want a stack of chips with the ingredients dumped on top, but that's just me. Had a bite of the wife's burger and it was good as well. Menu is full of special sandwiches and burgers as well as salads and apps.   Only negative was that the PBR was $2.50...now that's steep for a PBR, even knowing how much I love it.",

I went in with modest expectations - I wanted some good bar food, a table and a chance to watch the game. Overall - Angry Ale's delivered. Now, don't get me wrong - it's a sports bar with a menu. It's not a place to bring children or expect gourmet cuisine. It's not the nicest sports bar I've ever been to, but it's certainly not the diviest. The bathrooms were clean, the waitress (Lindsay) was nice and attentive and the food was pretty good!  I ordered the Baby Burger w/cheese - A 4 ounce patty with cheddar, lettuce, tomato on a toasted bun. I choose sweet potato fries as my side. The juicy burger was just enough to satisfy me and I adored the toasted bun. The fries were a total winner - nicely cut sweet potato fries with cinnamon sugar dusted over the top. NOM.  Prices were affordable for food and drinks and TVs were plentiful. I'll definitely come back to Angry Ale's to watch another game - as long as it's not super crowded!",

I said, that's fine, okay, please step away from me. He said, I'm the general manager, are you going to be a problem? Escalated the whole thing way beyond a simple question.

Its got a \"hole in the wall\" feel inside but that's not a bad thing.  The outdoor patio is huge and great on a warm summer night.  The staff has always been very friendly.  The servers are alway great and friendly and I've never had a bad server experience here.  Same with the bartenders.  Always attentive and friendly.  If someone is at the door checking IDs those guys are always great also.  No \"meathead attitudes\" that I've seen. Only reason I give 4 stars is that the bathrooms are pretty gross.  But what do you expect from a hole in the wall?  Luckily, I've never had to use the bathroom to take care of any serious business.  I would probably go home instead!  Haha. The food here is very good, too.  It's your typical \"bar fare\" and I've never had a bad snack here.  Burgers are good, love the pretzel bites, nachos are on point (they build a whole nacho on each single chip, pretty cool), and the buffalo chicken bites are great. They have tater tots, too.  Who doesn't love tater tots?  They have great fries, too.  They have a crunchy coating on them which I love. Highly recommend this joint to kill an afternoon or night watching sports and relaxing in a chill atmosphere.",

Our server was extremely rude and short with us- acted like she would rather wait on the table or mid-twenties men instead of pay us attention. She then took our cards for payment and took fifteen minutes to run them. She instead flirted with her other tables until we reminded her that she had our cards. The food was good but the terrible service killed our experience.",

I don't even remember  Service: Good and attentive - the bartenders that is.  Place: Typical bar place, but feels blah. Another 2 restrooms place for the women's while there is a long line to wait..  This place is fine just to go to for a change of scenery from Andrew Blair's and Brazwells.  But I don't like staying here too long since its just not my cup of tea. I can tell you this, the boys loved the place - guy's hangout place :)",

They arrived warm, too. I also ordered the nachos which were great! With ground beef, they did a great job of distributing the items among the chips, meaning, every chip was covered! I'll order again for sure.",

    "text": "The place to chill with a few pitchers of beer after a group sport. I've only ever sat in the patio and it's wonderful when the weather is mild, i.e. not humid. Couple of TVs spread around, always tuned into some sports game. Service is really friendly but can be slow, so expect to wait if you need anything from a waiter/ess, unless you chase em down. Food is just aiite, they no longer have the tree hugger burger or portobello burger. Veggie wrap is just okay and fish tacos would be much better if they provided a lime to go with it.   Great place to just hang out and watch a game. You can probably find me here at least once a week...but don't, bc that'd be stalking.",

    "text": "Yep.  Four stars my friends.  It started as a party of four at Good Food on Montford.  Yes, I know the place is fantastic, but after we had spent a lot of money already and were still somewhat hungry.  What is there to do?  Yep... Angry Ale's.    We finished off the night with an order of Chicken Fingers.  Some tossed in buffalo, some basic with dips.  I know I was already a few glasses of wine into the evening, but I know great chicken tenders when I eat them!  These tasted so fresh, so moist, and perfectly fried crispy.    We have been here before and support the local bars, but this stood out and I had to leave a review.  Great beers and well-above-average bar food!  The menu gets creative and the staff is excellent.",

Got wings, burgers, fries, nachos...normal bar food that SHOULD be easy enough to cook right. Food was decent enough going in...not so much COMING OUT!  Spoke to my buddy and he's having the same \"issues\".      Our bathrooms are on different floors of the house, so I haven't seen my wife in about 12 hours. I hope the dog doesn't need to go outside anytime soon or we may be dealing with more than just my wife and me.  Food poisoning on an Italian cruise ship run aground or a North Korean labor camp may be the norm, but I thought this was America!  Clean it up Angry Ale's!",
