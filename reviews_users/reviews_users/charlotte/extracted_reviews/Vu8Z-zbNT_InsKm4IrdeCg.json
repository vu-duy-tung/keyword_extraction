    "text": "Pretty good burgers. They tend to be a little salty sometimes due to the cooks getting a little overzealous with the seasoning when they are cooking up the patties. We have started to request no seasonings on the hamburger meat and that has solved that problem. I'm giving 3 stars because I'm not a huge fan of the shoestring style french fries and although they have a few flavor options for the fries they don't offer anything other than shoestring style fries. My wife got a salad once and it was pretty big and she said it was good. Overall, other than the fries we really like this place.",

    "text": "The first time I tried Smashburger, I wasn't expecting a \"chain burger\" to be so good. In fact, I went back a few more times to make sure it wasn't a tasty fluke. My burgers took about 5 minutes each to arrive, but were worth the wait and tasted much, much better than any fast food burgers you can get in 2 minutes. I left the last visit thinking out loud that Smashburger is the \"Starbucks of fast burgers\" because their customization, options, and consistent execution are where they really shine.   The burger patties themselves are good - not the best I've ever had, but a tasty, solid option. Their avocado club burger had fresh cooked bacon and what looked like a half an avocado on it. The  bbq, bacon, and cheddar burger was sweet, smoky, and salty all at the same time. The truffle mushroom swiss burger is on par with what I'd expect to eat at a much fancier farm to table place. Their (very skinny) fries are tossed in olive oil, rosemary, and garlic and come in multiple variations.  If you don't see something you like on the menu, customization is the name of the game. You can order custom toppings, sauces, breads, or even sub out the burger for chicken or a black bean burger. This is the first fast burger place I've felt like I can order my food in any combination available and be fully satisfied with the results.  Update: Stick with the burgers, I tried the chicken and it was a sliced patty that was dry and overly peppery.",

They have several standard burgers, but you can also custom order your burger and have your choice of bun, cheese, and 15 sauces and toppings. The sweet potato fries were also very good. The milkshakes were homemade with several different flavors available beyond chocolate & vanilla.  Yummy! If you want a premium burger, fries and/or milkshake experience, this is it.  However it's not cheap.  Expect to spend about $11 for a burger, fries and soda.",

Think of it as a cleaner steak-n-shake with better food.   The burgers really are pretty darn good. Not the best I've had but better than say 5 Guys. I like their fries as they are really thin a crispy. Their shakes are very good as well.   The only catch is the price. It's around $10-11 for a burger a fries. That is a problem as I can go to say a place like Kickstand and get a better burger for about the same money.   Also at this location the parking is not ideal so be prepared for that. A bit of a pain to get in and out.   So yeah 3 stars. Maybe 3.5 but that's it. I wouldn't drive out if of my way but if you're in the area worth a try.",

My initial thought was how cute the restaurant is. It's kind of in its own little nook in the far corner of Cotswold shopping center. The staff were all very friendly and though they were crowded, the food was served quickly.   I ordered a classic SmashBurger with sweet potato fries. The burger itself was a good size, flavorful, and quite juicy. The egg bun was a nice touch. I will probably customize my burger a little more next time, but wanted to see how the classic would stand on its own. I was not disappointed. The sweet potato fries were fresh, not soggy and had the lightest dusting of sea salt. I'd give the fries a 3 out of 5.   All in all, this was a good first experience and I'm looking forward to returning.",

I'm glad that I decide to order takeout. It might be odd that I come to this place just for a chicken sandwich. The buffalo and blue cheese, grilled chicken sandwich is phenomenal. I know this is a burger joint, but trust me when I say that the chicken sandwich is worth paying $10. I also enjoy great french fries which Smashburger's has. The Smashfries, which are coated with rosemary and olive oil, are some of the best fries that I have ever consumed. Just as a side note: make sure that everything is correct in your order because accidents happen when business is booming. Eat here if you have not!",

Because their burgers are DARN TOOTIN GREAT....that's why!  You know, upon thinking about it, you've got to believe that the reason a brand becomes a \"chain\" is because they have a pretty good product to being with, right? Think of The Cheesecake Factory. Yes, I'm a BIG FAN! Like I am with P.F. Changs, Five Guys Burgers. GREAT food and service (usually). So why not Smashburger? OK Smashburger, you WIN!  Had their \"Big\" Mushroom Truffle Burger on an Egg Bun. Added bacon and grilled onions. MAN was this ever a SLOPPY burger....just the way I like them! Very juicy and very \"BEEFY\" meaning, plenty of FAT and not lean. Hey if I wanted lean I'd eat Chicken Breast, right? No Sirloin Burgers here....must be Chuck or something like that. Nevertheless, it really was great!  Oh, their fries are parmesean herb shoestrings which were REALLY good! I love shoestrings because they remain crispy, and the flavor that Smashburger imparts on them are really great!  Overall a 4.37 STAR experience! I just wish that they'd offer a Double Burger for us True Meat-a-tarians!",

Don't get me wrong, the food was still very good although I think it had sat for a while before getting to my table. The big issue was that it took 25 minutes before they delivered my cheeseburger and fries to my table. They were certainly having some sort of issue because the restaurant was not crazy busy. I think it was system or kitchen related. Others around my table had problems with their order and delays.  With this said, I definitely will return. Problems happen sometimes - I won't hold this against them.",

    "text": "Today was mine and my family's first experience with smash burger. We decided to use the online ordering and pay in advance and pick up at a certain time. That feature was nice and they had it all ready by the time I got there to pick it up. Or so we thought all of it was ready and there.   We got home to realize that the salad dressing for one of the salads was missing and we were missing a smash fry as well. These are both small items , but still frustrating since, to correct this issue, we would have to get back in the car and return to where we had just came. With NCAA final four happening - who wants to do that? And I'm sure the smash fry tastes glorious - but I was shafted from that experience unfortunately.   Secondly, we got two house side salads and they looked completely different. There wasn't any consistency. One salad looked to have all the toppings while the second one just had lettuce and nothing else. Pretty disappointing. And since I didn't have dressing - I have to wait until I go to the store to get some.   Thirdly, the chicken sandwiches we got was explained as 'they flattened chicken and threw it on a George foreman grill'. There was no marinating and it was about the thickness of a piece of paper. There were times my friend was eating the sandwich and could not even tell if he was getting any chicken.   I would say that I would likely not go here again just from this one experience. The burger that I had tasted fine and wasn't bad quality - but not worth the price considering these pit falls.",

If you're gluten free like I am, you're in luck. The GF buns are delightful. They're large and soft, which is a hard combo to come by. GF buns often come out stale and crumbly elsewhere, but Smashburger has always been on point.  The milkshakes are fantastic, and if you mention you'll be sharing one they'll bring it out in two separate glasses, each with their own whipped cream and toppings. This is one of those little things that makes a big difference as it comes to service.  I've ordered Smashburger in-store, through Postmates, and called for pick-up and every time my order is perfect. I can't say enough great things about this place.",

And that's just it: at this price, I need burger to be BANGING!  Don't get me wrong, the burgers are good and juicy as they state. Today, I opted for the bacon cheeseburger with all the fixings - onions, pickles, ketchup, mustard plus grilled onions. The pickle had a bit of a strong flavor for me but wasn't bad. The thing that threw me was the egg bun. The flavor of the bun was nothing special, but it was a little tougher than I'd like. To me, the best thing at this place is the Smashfries - tossed with olive oil, rosemary and garlic. Mmmm. I'll return on another coupon offer - I am a member of the Smash Club.   Overall, it's good.

They were thick cut though. I like thick cut fries better... if you like the skinny fries then you'll like this joint.   I had the Carolina Classic... which was decent. Dude at the restaurant told me that he put a fork in my bag because the burger can be pretty messy with the chili. Welp! Guess someone forgot to make it extra messy that night because the chili was perfectly contained... and he forgot the fork.   My dude had some chicken burger. It wasn't memorable.   I also had a chocolate cookies and cream shake. It was aight.   Still can't touch Bad Daddy's... I go hard for a bean burger. That's saying something if I prefer their bean burger over this place beef burgers. Perhaps it was the prices too. Eh... at least I can say I tried it.",

If you are dining in it's easier to park closer to Harris Teeter and walk across the lot than use Smash's little lot and fight for the light when you leave.  Burgers are good and come in regular or \"big\" sizes.  The classic smash is tasty.  Fries come in plain or \"smash\" seasoned.  The veggie fries are not my thing, just taste like half-cooked greasy carrots and string beans.  The organization inside is bewildering.  You're forced to enter one way and exit another which really doesn't help anything.  If there isn't an expediter at the pickup window, which is apparently often, it's like fighting through a pool of piranhas to get your food when it's called.    The kitchen is not great at special requests like \"hold the onions\" and \"no cheese\" so it's better to order something simpler and add on special items you want.  But all in all not bad food and I would brave it again to give them another chance.",

The registers for ordering are right next to the door, creating a very tight environment, won't be fun come winter time. Booth seats seem abnormally low. My husband got his usual BBQ, bacon cheddar and seemed pretty satisfied with it. I tried something new (the burger with mushroom and Swiss) I should have stuck with my usual of the baja burger, this new one lacked the flavor I'm used too. The smash fries were really good as always. Service was also great, everyone was so curious and constantly checked on us. I am glad there is now a location closer to center city.",

If you don't like one of their 7 suggested burger options, you can alway build your own. Plus, if you're GF- have no fear! They even offer GF burger buns! Gluten fans rejoice! There's also a pretzel bun available that is a game changer to any sandwich.   They have a variety of different sides including buffalo fries (yes please!) and fried pickles! There aren't many fast food places that serve fried pickles so this is a win for me! I got the pickles (duh) and split the original fries with my husband, which have garlic and rosemary on them. Very delicious.  I didn't order one, but they do have some pretty bomb milkshakes on the menu. Next time I'll have to try one! Almost everyone in the restaurant had on- fail on my part.",

    "text": "1st of all let me say that Smashburger Corporate customer service is amazing. I had an issue when I signed up for the Rewards and went to the Ballantyne location, but they solved it ten fold. Now customer service at this location wasn't that great, which is sad, because I only got take out. When I walked up to the counter, I showed him my reward on the App and he responds \"Ok\". So then I say\"This is my 1st time here\", because I didn't know their process for claiming rewards and he just stared blankly at me. So I think to myself I guess i'll just order. I ordered the Big Create Your Own Beef Burger with Cheese, Bacon, Lettuce, Spinach, Cucumber, Onion & Pickle, Regular Smash Fries and a Regular Drink. So once I complete my order he tells me to scan my reward, which I didn't know where the scanner was. Being my 1st time, he could have at least pointed to it. But he just stared at me as I searched. Then once I find it, its turned backwards, instead of positioning properly for me, of course I had to do it myself. So I was annoyed with this entire interaction. But the food made up for it. I loved the nice grilled taste of their hand pattied burgers. The fries had a very unique flavor that i could see myself craving later. They were also fried perfectly to a crisp. I will definitely return and hopefully since I figured everything out today my ordering process will be better.",

The first is out in the Stonecrest Shopping Center in Ballantyne. So excited to have one near me.   My current favorite burger is the truffle mushroom swiss. The barbecue, bacon and cheddar bacon a close second. There is even a regional burger: the Carolina chili. Warning: get extra napkins. You can also create your own burger and have the option to pick whichever bun style you want on existing menu items.  Don't do burgers? Get a chicken sandwich. They smash those, too!! The spinach, cucumber, goat cheese and the avocado club are both delicious. Refuse to eat something that use to have a face? Go with the avocado ranch black bean burger. Interesting texture and flavor. The salads are HUGE.   I recommend going here with a friend(s) so you can share sides. The smashfries are tossed in olive oil, rosemary and garlic. You can't go wrong with that. Haystick onions are delicious. SECRET MENU SIDE ITEM ALERT: fried pickles.   This place is slammed at lunch. The parking lot is kind of small and awkward to get in and out of when it's busy. Note: there's only one way in and our of the lot. I learned that the hard way... twice. Both times while driving with one arm. #slinglife.   The workers are all really helpful and come to check on the tables often. Your first visit you may sit there and try to remember what use to be here. Spoiler alert: it was a bank.  Great addition to this neighborhood. I think this location will do well here.",

    "text": "We hit the new Smashburger off Randolph (behind Harris Teeter) on an \"off night\" once the grand opening crowds died down a little.  It's a nice spacious restaurant with ample parking behind it (who knew?).  It just sits at a very crowded traffic signal, and many times I've seen lines out the door.  Literally.  Out the door.    Since there was no line, we were able to order pretty quickly at the counter and grab a booth to wait for our food to be delivered to us.    Smashburger is a chain restaurant, yet its burgers (thankfully!) taste nothing like your typical fast food burger joints.  Yes, I'm calling you out McDonald's, Burger King, etc. with your pseudo-burgers.  The burgers are big, flavorful, and, yes, real.  I also like that they offer \"gourmet\" burger toppings, as I like some variety.  I opted for the Spicy Jalapeno Baja burger.  It wasn't super spicy (at least not for me), but it did have a kick, was juicy, and had lots and lots of flavor, both the toppings and the smashed burger itself.  The skinny fries have some great spices and herbs on them, too.    The prices are a bit high for fast food, but I guess compared to the \"competitors,\" you get what you pay for, so it's worth it.   I've always thought Five Guys was pricey, too, but I think Smashburger has them beat in both taste and atmosphere (although no free peanuts!).    Would we return?  Definitely.  As long as there's no line out the door.",

The Carolina Chili burger and the Spicy Jalapeno Baja burger were great! The fries are too thin in my opinion, but if you get the Smashfries you are in for a tasty treat. The burger patty itself was so juicy and delicious. I removed the huge jalapenos from my burger just because they were so big, and the sandwich was still spicy to my liking without them.   The prices are reasonable, but it would be better if a small side of fries came with the burgers instead of having to purchase them separately. What's a burger without fries? The staff was nice, but had an issue when my husband and I wanted to order our sandwiches before the fries. For some reason, that complicated things?   My only complaint is the booths are not high enough for the tables. They are terribly uncomfortable. I recommend the restaurant get that situation fixed. I am average height, 5'7\", so I can't image a shorter person or child trying to sit there to eat.   I recommend Smashburger when you want a quick bite to eat. A little better than fastfood, but you also pay for it.",

The food was very comparable to what you would get at Steak N Shake, but twice the price.  We werent able to get a combo meal since we got shakes.  If the changed that policy it would make them more competitive.",

    "text": "I've been in and around the Cotswold shopping center a lot recently and I figured it was time to give this place a shot.   Walking in immediately gives you that fast casual vibe. Lots of seating, check out counter off to the left, drink machines and napkins and such in the back. No line when I got there (just after lunch rush) so I went ahead and ordered a double hamburger with fries and a drink. Go over to grab my drink and see they have those wonderful Coke Freestyle machines. More options to choose from is always a plus in my opinion.   Go to find a seat and wait on my order and I come to my only real problem with this place. The tables were not great. Crumbs everywhere, both on the tables and the seats, some with random liquid spots plopped about. I found one of the less crumby ones and made due with some napkins but its not exactly what you want to see when you're about to eat.   The food itself helped make up for my issues though. When it arrived it was piping hot. Oil still shimmering on the surface of the fries because were that fresh out of the fryer hot. Unfortunately my fries were unsalted but they have salt on the table so I suppose its not that big an issue. Flavor was there though. Not sure what oil they use but they managed to produce almost perfectly crisp little potato sticks. Burger itself was very good. Bun was soft, patties were flavorful, meat wasn't overcooked. They actually season the beef it seems. I had visited a similarly styled competitor not too long ago and their burger just didn't seem to match up to the flavor here. I notice a lot of other peoples reviews mention problems with overly greasy food, and while a burger is always going to have a little bit of grease I didn't have those issues.  I think if the management of this store had a bit of a refresher course with their staff about keeping the dining room clean this place could really shine. Whoever is running the kitchen in the back knows how to make a delicious burger and sometimes that is just what you need. There is room for improvement, but overall not a bad place to grab a bite.",

It was that kind of night. Crave a burger night. I went to Smashburger just expecting to get something basic. Instead I opted for the Spicy Jalapeno Baja. It was your basic burger, but added in were freshly sliced Jalapenos, chipotle mayo and pepper jack cheese on a rustic bun. It was great and so fresh! The fries weren't nasty and greasy, and went perfectly with a side of ranch dressing.  Overall, I'm back on the burger bandwagon, and I don't have to settle for some greasy fast food mess if I want something quick to eat. The staff was also very friendly, which was surprising considering I walked in about 30min before closing. I'll be back!",

Was with a friend who explicitly ordered a gluten-free bun with her burger because she has celiac disease.   After her eating some of the burger, she realized it was not gluten-free and went to ask for a refund. The manager and staff were terribly unprofessional and dealt with the issue horribly. They were argumentative with her about the validity of her allergy, and they were hesitant to give a refund or deal with the issue properly.   I would not recommend this location if you have any dietary restrictions because they completely ignore their responsibility to respectfully deal with any allergies.   Her allergy is serious, and the fact that they placed the blame back on the customer was absurd. Very disappointed with this Smashburger location and all of the staff. I'd never expect a manager to be so extraordinarily unprofessional and disrespectful. I will not be back here again.",

Everything is just so good, the workers are nice and patient and willing to help get you a coupon or something by taking like a survey for a side, downloading their app for a free entree if you order a side and drink and yeah. I've gone here 3 times and the quality hasn't dwindled yet. The smash fries are probably the best, if not one of the best, out of any place I've been to. The difference between them and their normal fries is that they are tossed in garlic, olive oil and rosemary which you can definitely taste, they're also somehow not soggy. Just dang, everything is put together perfectly. The only downside is it's a bit expensive. It's like $10-$12 just for a CYO burger with cheese and a large pack of fries. It's worth it by all means but it's just not somewhere you could go every day unfortunately(which you would want to do because it's so good). They also play my type of music, like the first time I noticed they were playing my favorite band, Bastille and it wasn't even their most famous song.",

Although I wasn't a huge fan of the smash sauce, the burger was cooked perfectly. The cheese covered the burger and was melted too perfection. And, the pickles, OMG, classic dill, great on a burger! As for the fries, I could eat them everyday.  Shoestring fries perfectly cooked, a little crisp but soft on the inside. As others have mentioned prices are high for a fast food burger chain, but knowing the burgers are cooked fresh upon ordering and definitely don't taste like other \"fast food\" burgers, they are worth it in my mind.

Love love love. Ignore the chain haters and those who say it is too expensive. You get what you pay for. Oh! And get the Smash fries. You can always work out tomorrow...",

    "text": "I waited for this Cotswold Smashburger a long time. It's nice knowing I can stop in, so close to home, and get a fresh-cooked burger made like I choose. It's especially needed here in the Cotswold n'hood. The burgers are nothing all that 'WOW' and I think they're quite high dollar ($7) for a burger. Fries of any kind are extra $ and the very skinny fries. I DO like their Smashfries that are tossed in rosemary/garlic/oliveoil. They have lots of other foods and ice cream shakes, too! I'm sorta limited to what I can eat, as I'm a gastric bypass survivor. They DO allow me to eat off the KidsMenu, as do so many other great CLT restaurants, which I am thankful for. Even a kids meal burger is 2 meal for me. I'm going to adventure the menu more soon! Of note is they have one of those 100+ kinds soda machines and while I am not a soda drinker, the machine also has flavored waters and a Segrams Lemon-Lime in it! The Smashie workers are all polite & mostly college-aged...and appear happy at work.  The Take-out Bar/waiting section could/should be redone...as it's in a strange place and when the place is busy you are always in someones way. Parking is there behind the place, BUT if you visit know the in/out are ONE...and difficult to get out of behind th HTeeter. Park on the Randloph Rd side of HT for better escape once done with your Smashburger!",

    "text": "A little disappointed with SmashBurger. Today was our first time and we ordered food to pick-up. We got there at the pick-up time and they said a few more mins. After waiting 20 mins past the time, I asked someone else who said \"Oh, you're ready\" and handed us a bag. They made mistakes on two of the four burgers we ordered. I am giving a three because the burger tasted very good. Since mine had the wrong bun, could've have been better.",

It was pretty good this time around, definitely will go back there again. I got the bbq bacon burger and fries and a kids cheeseburger. The kids meal is a bit pricey even compared to restaurants but they do give you a ton of food, and we had plenty to take home And make two meals out of it. The service was great while in there, people always walking around asking if you need anything.",

Spent almost $60. On \"fast food.\" At a burger place. And we're not piggies. Got regular meals. I think one of us got a shake. It's just so expensive. Esp for food you don't want to eat. And it's SUCH a disappointment. Waited soooo long for this place to open. And...um...no. Customer service is spot on. But for $10-$12 burgers/sandwiches you can't eat?? Boo. No thank you.",

I travel to this side of town for work and love when I get to stop in and have a fresh made smashburger. They even have a patio to dine outside as well. I would recommend this to anyone. Combo meals range around $11-$13 if you go big and get the smash fries which I would recommend. I would take a smashburger over five guys any day of the week...not that five guys is bad just comparing price range to quality.",

And that is what it is, fast food joint; but its very different and they actually have great burger combinations (both chicken or beef) and their fries and amazing!, specially because they have sweet potato fries!. Their shake are pretty sweet!, but at least for me still dairy queen has the best shakes. As for the service I like that they are very quick at it, even on crowded days.",
