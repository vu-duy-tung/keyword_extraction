For our entrees we had the shrimp and scallops burger, the cracked lobster sandwich, and a Cajun grouper sandwich.

I started off with a dark and Stormy cocktail that was perfect, with just the right balance of Rum, Crabbies ginger Beer and lime juice. Then we got the Conch fritters, best I have had since Key West. We talked to the owner, seafood is fresh everyday and everything is made fresh in house. Also try the smoked fish dip, heaven on a cracker. Main course I got the cracked conch pounded out nice and thin then fried in a very light batter, no grease at all. Served with a wonderful dipping sauce and peas and rice with your choice of another side. Try the Caribbean pickles, pickled cucumbers with a hint of sweet and heat. My wife got the chicken Roti, huge flakey pastry very flavorful curry mix inside ask for the mango habanero sauce to set it off perfectly. Save room for the Key Lime pie, you won't be sorry!",

If you are going to have upper price points for both entrees AND wine/drinks, you are going to limit repeat visits. We aren't going to be regulars for weekly/weekday dinner with $23 fish/two sides plate and $9+ glass of wine.  Again, the fish has been great!

You immediately notice ALL the people here are friendly and happy.  Not a put on just nice to the customers and each other (makes you realize how other places operate differently).  You won't have a dozen choices for fish, maybe 4-5 but you will find something you like. Serve clams, oysters, conch too.   Truly fresh fish, did the grilled (several other options Blackened, fried, garlic butter, etc)  (Hog Snapper fresh catch this night) it was cooked & seasoned perfectly as a platter ($26ish) vs with a sandwich or salad.  Had the Pikliz cabbage salad as an optional side was warned it would be hot, it was, wasn't my thing but tried it.  Would have liked a little bigger portion.  Rice with snapper was flavored mildly good not great.   My wife had the Hog Snapper sandwich ($16ish) and really enjoyed it.    Talking to staff after dinner, this is truly a labor of love and they are striving to give an excellent food experience.  Owner, Earl, told us his priority is quality and consistency over speed.  So sometimes the wait for food may be longer, but he believes it will always be worth it.  Our Fri night wait for food was normal.   They raved about Michelle's desert but just too full.

That is, the food is fine in general but naming dishes after Caribbean cuisine may set a bar too high. The conch fritters are fine but if you've had conch fritter made by someone from the islands then there they fall short. The jerk chicken again is fine as a spicy chicken dish but I'm Jamaican so I'd caution someone expecting Jamaican jerk chicken to calibrate their expectations.  The pickliz wasn't pickliz...my Haitian husband confirmed. My recommendation:  hire a consultant specializing in authentic Caribbean cuisine for certain dishes.",

We have had cracked conch in Florida, Bahamas, and Turks & Caicos and this was spectacular.   They fly in sea food fresh daily and that is no False advertisement. From the conch appetizers to grilled Mahi entree with rice and mango salsa it was the freshest ingredients I have enjoyed at a restaurant in a long time, and for an incredibly fair price.

The food was delicious. Sides were really good, we had rice( a must have), potato salad, yucca fries and regular fries... all very good.  My husband had jerk chicken and I had grilled shrimp, both were very good.  Only complaint was the jerk chicken was fresh or hot( was room temp and had consistency that it was prepared the day before.  Still the flavor was on point.  We will be back, next time I can't wait to try the lamb shank and Caribbean pork.",

I am not exaggerating. The owner is a friendly fellow that often check on tables. You feel like family after a few times. There are not a lot of experiences I have had that rate this high.

Choose the fresh fish - we had snapper that was a very generous portion, well seasoned and fresh fresh fresh. Big side salad - plenty of food we probably could have shared an entree fish sandwich.

    "text": "This fantastic new restaurant has only been open for a few weeks, and I've already been back four times! The focus is on seafood with fresh fish flown in weekly. The menu features a \"Fresh Catch\" selection which changes weekly. The fresh catch can be ordered as part of a salad, or on a sandwich, or on a platter with two sides. There are also other items on the menu if seafood isn't your thing, or just not what you want today. Check out the Jerk Chicken!!! \"Raw Bar\" selections are available along with several starters and sides, and some very good desserts!   From the starter menu, I've had the Conch Fritters and the Conch Chowder - both are excellent! As noted earlier, there are several  sides to choose from, but my favorite is the Caribbean Rice! From the fresh catch list, I've had the Mahi, Swordfish, and Halibut - all excellent! You can select your catch from the availability of the week and then have it prepared how you like it, including blackened, grilled, or fried. Most (if not all) desserts are made in-house, but do yourself a favor and try the bread pudding!  It is no doubt some of the very best bread pudding I've had anywhere!  They also have a full bar with a variety of beer, wine and other liquors.There is also a patio for outside dining.  Chef Earl and his wife Michelle have put a LOT into this new venture and I'm clearly impressed. It is not part of a franchise or a chain. The island \"vibe\" in the restaurant is very nice and service has been excellent!   This gem is a little hard to find, but they are in the Fountains Shopping Center at the corner of Ardrey Kell Road and Tom Short Road. It is located back in a corner, by the fountain, with colorful umbrellas outside on the patio. KEEP LOOKING, it's worth it!!",

We've tried almost everything on the menu and have not been disappointed.    Some of our favorite appetizers include conch fritters, fried oysters, smoked fish dip and island-style bites.    We've tried all of the fresh catch specials, preferring that they be simply grilled so we can enjoy the flavors of fresh fish.   And the fish is fresh, not frozen.  If the  oyster roll is on the menu, I'm ordering it!    Wonderful roll loaded with perfectly fried oysters!   Earl, the owner and chef, knows how to prepare fantastic seafood!  Our favorite sides are the Key West slaw, potato salad, and the sweet mango salsa, as mango salsa should be.  We're usually too full to eat desert there, so we often take it home to enjoy later.   All are made from scratch by Michelle and are simply amazing!  We've eaten them all.  Sometimes we sit at a table, but we also like to sit at the bar so we can talk to our favorite bar tender, Michelle.  She makes awesome drinks and is just a really fun person.  We've taken friends and family there and all agree that Island Thyme is the real deal when it comes to fresh, flavorful food, great service, and a really fun atmosphere.",

The location is well hidden, not easily seen from main road and is hampered by the Landlord ban on overt advertising and outdoor entertainment. Unfortunately since The Irish pub was let go from this location many years ago, several ventures have failed.   Inside the decor and music carry an Caribbean theme, and are pleasantly welcoming. It is good to see the bar from O'Shea's still in use and in fine condition.   We ordered 3 starters and two sides and a desert (baked banana and Icecream- it was awesome). The West Indies BBQ shrimp, smoke fish dip and shrimp BRUSCHETTA.   Though I thought the price of the food items was a little high, the quality and taste was very satisfying and clean and flavourful. I will return to try other items on the menu.   Also order a pina colada, which lacked coconut and any rum flavour. Next time I will try the local Charlotte breweries beer.",

Nice taste, I expected stronger flavors, not impressed by their size (40/lb?)  3 stars -1/2 Jerk chicken, not well marinated nor nicely roasted either. The skin was pale, the flesh pinkish and the jerk was slathered on top. The worst part was the rice which came with it, it was cooked to death and mushy, frankly disgusting.  2 stars for the chicken, negative for the rice.

My hubby had the bbq shrimp platter. The shrimp was fresh also. The rice & peas were a little under seasoned but very tasteful if ur having a blackened fish because it bring balance.  Well...dessert was a hard decision but we decided upon Keylime Pie & Bread Pudding. The keylime pie was a great combo of sweet & tart. The Bread pudding was very tasteful. It needs extra sauce because the bread absorbs the sauce quickly. I recommend this place & we shall return again.",

If your in a rush this is not the best choice. The name \"Island Time\" should be your first clue. This is a place to have a relaxing time with friends - which we did.",

    "text": "I am not an avid review writer for YELP. But, whenever I travel a fair amount and I do use YELP. If I have great food or great service, I enjoy writing a complimentary review. This is the first time I have written a negative review on YELP.   I took my wife and children(ages 16,18 and 23) to dinner to celebrate my 52nd birthday. It was my idea to try Island Thyme based on a 4/5 YELP rating. For background, my wife and I are from Louisiana, and we know good food, and we know good seafood. South Louisiana has a French to Caribbean feel to a lot of the cuisine. We use rice in numerous dishes. I have travel to the Caribbean a dozen times or more and eaten authentic Caribbean food as well. Island Thyme is not on point.   The hostess was nice, stating that they are not a franchise, they are from South Florida and bring in all their seafood fresh from South Florida. It sounds great! But, the food tasted pre-frozen to me and my entire family.   I had the Triple Tail with Caribbean Rice and Yucca Fries. My wife had the Shrimp Platter and my daughter had the Crab Cake Platter. The Yucca fries were all the exact same size and shape(suspicious). The fries were crispy on the outside, but not soft on the inside, like fresh cut Yucca fries usually are. They were a bit chewy. I don't know if they were pre-cut/pre-frozen fries, but they presented that way. The rice had a musky taste, almost like burnt oil. My wife's rice tasted the same. My daughter's crab cake tasted like the crab cakes you can buy frozen from an number of grocery stores. The Triple Tail had a bit of a \"fishy\" taste to it. I literally sprinkled it with Tabasco to get 1/2 of it down. We were all really trying to make this work, after all it was my birthday and we are a pretty positive bunch. But, finally we just had to admit that this was awful food.   In short, if they are using fresh fish and fresh Yucca, it did not taste like fresh. The service was great, the staff was cheerful, the decor was cool. But, we came for fresh Caribbean food and Island Thyme did not deliver.",

Everything (well food-wise) I've missed about my home town in South Florida, summer trips to the Keys & Bahamas.   This is a small family-owned and operated business and they really have something here.   I honestly can say that this place is on par with food I've eaten in the Caribbean, if not better!   You can't even get cracked conch in the keys...but here it is in Charlotte! What was once a special island vacation treat is now 10 min from my house and it is FRESH!   Speaking of fresh, EVERYTHING was super fresh as this fine establishment actually makes daily trips to pick up their shipment from the airport!   They have excellent, friendly staff with a fun Florida style atmosphere. Really reminds me of home.   I can't say enough good things about them. Go give it a try!",

Simply, I liked the place i.e. decor, service, friendliness of the staff etc.....I thought the food could use some work. Went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch as we were passing by and Sweetie LOVES a fish sandwich.   Nice young man greets us and made some recommendations.  The menu was nicely done and they had a \"fresh catch\" menu which was a nice touch. I decided on the Hog Swordfish which I know is a hot commodity this time of year.  You can have it fixed a few ways, I chose cajun or blackened on a salad.  With the salad I think he said they have house made dressings so I went with soy ginger.  The salad came out and it was \"OK\".  The lettuce was HUGE, big leafy greens which needed to be chopped before they get put in the bowl.  The soy ginger? Flavorless.  As I have learned from watching years of Gordon Ramsey shows, you have to taste it before you send it out.  If someone had, it would have been jazzed up.  The fish?  It was cooked well, plump and juicy and the fish itself was very flavorful.  The blackening spice?  Flavorless.  I just tasted the fish and it was completely void of any blackened flavor.  It looked like it had plenty of seasoning, but it the flavor flashed off.   All that said, I like the concept.  Fresh, cooked to order seafood and some meat options.  Sandwiches, plates, and good friendly service.  I'll go back and try the food once again.",

The couple who own it are always there anf so fun and chatty.  BUT recently it has gone downhill on the food front. We went with a party of 3 a few weeks ago and ALL of our fish was overcooked and they messed up two of the orders. Its surprising given the menu is fairly straightforward too.  plus the prices seem to be getting more steep. the fish dish is now $25. I am not sure this will remain on our staple list...",

Serving up fresh fish daily on sandwiches, salads or in a combination with two sides in a casual environment that Jimmy Buffett would undoubtedly approve, this joint gets a lot of things right! Starting with the fresh fish (and ending with the house made desserts.)   The 25 minute wait time that our excellent waiter, Aaron, informed us about in advance was worth it (well, amost). I went with the grilled grouper salad with ginger dressing. It was perfectly prepared. The only real shortcoming was that, at $17.95, the tomatoes should have at least been bought at a local farmer's market. They are just too plentiful in our area for that not to be the case.   My wife went with these grilled pumpkin swordfish at $23.95 and two sides, the collard greens and mango salsa. The collards were a little spicy and the salsa was a little on the sweet side, but again, the fish was perfectly prepared.  We closed things out with an ample sized slice Michelle's Key Lime Pie for $5.95. It was very tart but pleasantly so. Overall, it was a good experience, the place had a 94.5 sanitary rating, the service was excellent and I'd say they're off to a good start.",

However, while we were eating, the owner walked over to the window that opens to the kitchen and began yelling and berating the cook. Very loudly. The entire restaurant could hear him.

However, I had to leave my lunch early, because of a loud argument between the manager/owner and two of his staff members.   Personally, I don't really care what the staff members did incorrectly. But, this man used profanity and I could hear him precisely. This was incredibly uncomfortable. We tried to get the attention of the man, but his back was turned to us. His employees stood and listened to him for the entire monologue. I'm hoping that this was a one-off and that the owner was having a bad day. I did stop to speak with the employees on the way out, who all apologized to us. Imagine getting yelled at by your boss and then apologizing to the customers. It made me sad for them. Yet, they didn't say a word about him. They just smiled. They're better folks than I could have been under that same circumstance. They could have told the owner that I was leaving, but it's not up to them. How would you go about telling your own boss that someone's leaving because of their actions? The staff was amazing.  I have worked in restaurants, I understand the stress. My first impulse was to call the restaurant and speak with the owner. But, I felt it would just end there. I'd like folks to go to this restaurant to just make sure it stays a friendly environment for everyone. They have a good thing going, I'd hate for them to get a reputation.   If the owner reads this: I love a locally-owned restaurant. Your employees are the number one reason for success. They cook the food, if they're talented and happy, then you're going to do well. There will be difficulties, but you need to keep your calm.   The food was excellent. Our waiter was so much fun: Josh. That guy has a ton of personality, and he was efficient and attentive. The atmosphere, and decor are super cool. I'd love to see what it would be like on a weekend night. I bet it's packed. The menu had price ranges from $8  - $ 23, so there's something for everyone. The food was excellent. Please take the above comments as constructive criticism. I did enjoy my meal. At home.",

    "text": "Was in the mood to try something new and different for lunch on Sunday, so decided to check out what was new on Yelp and that is where I came across a place called \"Island Thyme - A Calypso Grill & Pub\".  Hmmm, I thought, how timely, given that I will be heading to the Caribbean next week, and one of my most favorite things about traveling there is the amazing food I get to sample on the islands.  Given the fact that the place noted on their website that they are locally and family owned, I considered that a huge plus as I am always looking to support original places, as while I am not anti-franchise, I enjoy the variety and diversity that local original concepts offer, especially here in South Charlotte where that can be lacking at times.  In terms of location, you really have to be looking for it to find it, as it is located in the back section of the Fountains at Ardrey Kell.  The actual location is in the spot that I personally consider the Bermuda Triangle of restaurants as I am pretty sure that 4 or 5 other places have failed to last more than a year or two in this very same spot.  Outside, the decor definitely tries to give off that island vibe as all the expected accompaniments can be found including porch chairs, colorful signage and even a tropical feel cornhole set which is a nice touch.  Plenty of outdoor seating is available, but no awnings at present to keep the sun out of your eyes, so probably best to choose inside unless you are dining later in the evening, although I should point out that they close at 7pm on Sundays and at 10pm during the week and on the weekends, which is disappointing considering they have a full bar and could potentially be a fun spot to have a few drinks on a Friday or Saturday night.  Started off with a Pina Colada which was not good at all as it was very heavy on the pineapple juice to the point of being orange in color.  No coconut flavor at all even after I pointed out that the drink was very heavy on the juice.  Menu says it is made with rum, cream of coconut and pineapple juice, but unfortunately it tasted like an $8 dollar glass of Dole, so was very disappointed especially considering the \"island theme\" of the restaurant.  Strawberry Mojito was similarly disappointing as it tasted more of Strawberry juice/syrup than anything else, although I do give them credit for the use of fresh mint, as many places these days seem to think that Mint is an optional ingredient in Mojitos, so kudos for not skimping on the mint.  Again however, for $8, it is disappointing to have a drink taste like fruit juice as even the mint couldn't save this one.  As far as the food goes, some hits and some misses...    The jerk chicken was very good with an authentic Jamaican jerk flavor and nice spice level throughout, so definitely a nice job there in terms of overall presentation.    The Yucca fries on the other hand were not good at all, as they were too reliant on breading instead of letting the natural flavor shine through.  Yucca is a very underrated side in my opinion as it has some health benefits and a great flavor, but lathering on the breading makes it just like any other \"fry\" in my opinion.  I think the Yucca would be much better served in it's natural state vs the breaded and fried route, as the wonderful flavor of Yucca is enough to stand out on it's own without a bunch of breading.  The Crab Cake Sandwich had an abundance of crab meat inside which was a pleasant surprise as far too often, places rely on a large amount of filler, but no so here, so nice job in that respect.  Unfortunately, again the breading is the culprit, as the heavy reliance on Panko breading actually takes away from the flavor of the crab meat and takes the sandwich down a notch, whereas if a different lighter type of breading were used, this sandwich could have really stood out as the crab meat tasted very fresh.  The West Indies BBQ Shrimp was served in a sauce that the server described as sweet with some heat, but unfortunately the sauce was underwhelming to say the least, but the shrimp were very fresh and juicy, as I could tell that they take their commitment to fresh seafood seriously, which will definitely serve them well moving forward.    Overall, as much as I want to support local establishments, I also am aware that there are way too many other options out there to just give a place a pass simply because they are not a franchise.  The drinks were not good at all and the food was ok, but at the price points charged, weren't really a great value, although the jerk chicken was very good and worth giving a try if you have never experienced it before.  I would probably be willing to give it another shot, but wouldn't go out of my way as we have so many restaurants here in South Charlotte that a new place really needs to differentiate itself more than just in name only to get added to the rotation.  With all that said, I really hope they succeed as variety is the spice of life.",

The fried conch was amazing and the batter is light and tasty.  Even the desserts are all made in house and delicious.  And they also had fried plantains as a side; haven't had those since visiting S. Florida.   Definitely the best seafood I've had since moving from Florida. .",

We waited for a table for about 15-20 minutes on a Friday evening around 6pm and enjoyed expertly made tiki drinks (the Painkiller was especially good) while we waited at the bar.  For dinner we had conch fritters and the mahi-mahi platter (prepared with Cajun seasoning), with sides of rice, fries, and collard greens. All was amazing, and we would definitely order this again. For dessert we had key lime pie and the banana cake brownie -- both made in house and wonderful.  The service was perfect, and all the staff were very friendly. We can't wait to return!",

    "text": "Recommend patio seating. Table immediately in front of the patio door gets the brunt of the fan. So, if that isn't your thing - steer clear and ask for a different table. Fun atmosphere and excellent, good quality food - fresh and from scratch. Party of 4 and every one of us really enjoyed our choices. For those in the party that are non seafood eaters, options are a little more limited than usual. Be sure and check the menu ahead of time. This was our first time there and we'll definitely be going back. Hostess stand is inside and indoor waiting space is tight. When people are waiting, it makes it tough to get through. There is plenty of waiting space outside though.   Definitely check them out!",
