Then they expanded and double the size of the inside as well as a significantly larger patio area. Service has taken a dramatic turn.  We have been back many times post expansion attempting to give them a chance for redemption and the trend continues.   The waitstaff is not attentive and average wait from seating to food is one hour plus.  Our most recent visit was a one hour plus wait for two meals.   Food is still good, although in busy times the quality dips down.   Expansion has ruined this place.",

    "text": "I live a mile away and have always longed for a place close by I could get a good beer and some good food.  We visited last week to give it a go...didn't get a beer since I saw the taps and know what they taste like (good selections!) and we wanted to spend more on food. So we ordered:  First we ordered the guacamole deviled eggs, taste was very bland and needed help.  Didn't taste like a deviled egg and didn't really taste like guacamole either...needed something to get it off the fence, maybe lime and a little sea salt or something.  Next we got the Italian flat bread, the topping tasted good but considering on 2 different locations pepperonis were still stacked on each other 5 high I would say someone in the kitchen wasn't paying attention.  The bread was \"sorta\" flat but was still thing and chewy...I assume they get this and just put the toppings on it.  Didn't like the rubbery chew to the bread and it's obvious the bread is bought elsewhere.  Lastly we had the blackened fish tacos and house chips.   Some of the chips were really good and cooked to the browner-burned color I liked, others were VERY undercooked and had grease puddled on them which we didn't eat.  The fish taco's were just awful.  A little seasoning on them, not blackened at all and was a small piece in each taco with a little cabbage and I didn't see any cilantro at all....this and chips for $9???  (I admit when it comes to fish tacos I go to Cabo Fish Taco in NoDa but still....)  Service was very good and attentive, we sat outside which was set up really nice and besides the 3 older guys (regulars you could tell) sitting near the door that were talking like they were a mile apart and cursing like sailors the patio was really nice.  Maybe this was a bad night, not sure as we expected WAY better considering the reviews here.  Were giving it one more shot on the 30th of Aug for the benefit for the 5 year old cancer patient (AWESOME for Moochies to host a fundraiser for this girl!!) we hope for WAY better.",

I don't want too make a seen so I take my plate to the manager and she offers me another salad. I refused. Then she wanted to give me a gift card, this is after I already started to eat my salad!  I asked about comping the bill. She took off our entries and that's all. I'm retired military and I've eaten what a Billy goat would barf. No worries but, she only comped our dinner. Very disappointed, makes me wonder what else your eating!!!!!!# CJ",

    "text": "This is our new local hangout!  We went here once under the old management are weren't impressed. When it changed over to the new folks and was rechristened Moochies, we tried it again. It's one of the local places, some people always at the bar in the middle of the small restaurant at the edge of the shopping plaza. Lots of TVS, booth seating plus a really nice outdoor area that also has games. The perfect neighborhood not-a-dive. My husband orders the same thing: fried chicken sandwich which is golden brown and crispy and then dunked it a sauce of your choosing (he likes mild which is more like a medium to me).  I order the same thing 90% of the time! too. Fish and chips. Yes, fish and chips.  Being from New England, I ordered fish and chips at the PIZZA place so having it at a tavern-like pace makes perfect sense. Their version has two golden brown, crunchy fish pieces, a pile of seasoned fries and 2 wonderfully addictive hush puppies. I sometimes mix it up with their burgers which are huge and very good.  We've gotten to be regulars here and they even know our order. Nice people, a menu that covers pretty much everything but focuses on what people going to places like that want: good wings, lots of interesting appetizers and plenty of choices on tap.  My one suggestion: I'd like to see a sampler plate for an appetizer. Sometimes you can't choose just one thing and it'd be great to throw together a sampler with a couple hush puppies, some wings, a deviled egg, a couple pig wings, Mac and cheese bites, sweet potato fries...they have some great things to choose from.  A,good little place, friendly, doing what you want them to do: serving crunchy brown food and a cold drink. Love it.",

Our bartenders were very friendly, and they made a great margarita!  We came on a Tuesday evening, so it was open mic night. So much great talent in this bar! I wouldn't go up there unless you got serious skill, because this isn't amateur hour. Also Tuesday's are $4 margaritas!!!  You really can't go wrong with anything here!",

We expected a very basic menu, but we were wrong.  It is quite varied.  I had the Eggs in a Basket with bacon and home fries.  The Eggs were perfectly cooked and the bacon was very good.  The home fries were the big surprise.  Soft but still with some texture and had peppers and onions and a little bit of a bite to them.  Not enough of a bite to mask the other flavors but enough to notice. My wife had the Bananas Foster Waffle after the server recommended the waffles.  The waffle was light and fluffy and had just enough of the bananas and sauce. In an area that has several breakfast places that are worthy, we will be making Moochie's part of our weekend rotation.",

The food was not good by any stretch. Had chipotle sliders and wild boar sliders. Question if that was even wild boar...it was so overcooked that it was basically dried beef with sweet chili sauce.  Chipotle sliders had a splash of chipotle dry seasoning on them. Was not mixed in w beef. Fries and onion rings were OK...nothing special, nothing bad. Beer and whiskey selection was better than applebees or such, but it's Charlotte and most eateries have the same local stuff.  Very interested to see how this place ends up because it seemed like a bar for older people to drink stubby natty ice bottles and never enjoy the craft beer or whiskey part of the bar. This place was neither a restaurant or bar and needs to decide what it wants to be before it even approaches mediocrity in either category.",

Deviled eggs are very good and most of the apps. They have good drink specials. The gentleman who is always behind the bar makes good drinks and is attentive. They have bands every week if you like live music but it is very loud so don't expect to go here and have a conversation. Acoustics need work.   The bad- most of the bartenders seem to be in lala land and it takes effort to get service. The servers could be more attentive too. There is one girl that is really good but i don't remember her name. I wouldn't go for the wine, it always tastes old. Almost every night they have a \"theme\" going on that can be annoying if you don't want to listen to karaoke or open mike bands. If you go on the weekends they have band inside and outside so you cannot escape the noise. I wish they would stick to one.   All in all they are very busy but i think this is more so because of lack of competition. Not many choices in this area.",

The food and execution have taken a step back, however. Looks like they are now ordering pre made frozen burger patties. Also, leaving ingredients off entrees that are written on the menu has happened the last couple visits. We were there with the kids and left just before the band started playing, which was a good thing since they had set up a large speaker next to our table. I'm still wondering what target audience they are looking for. Is it a bar with live music that serves sub par food? If so, I can see why the previous owners went a different direction with their other restaurant concept located in the same shopping center. I will say that both times we have been there since the ownership change, the service has been very friendly. I think the things that they struggle with are easy to overcome and hope they get it straightened out. We would love to have a decent neighborhood place to go with the kids without having to drive a longer distance.Our bill is about $100 each time we go out and I imaging there are other families that would spend the same. Sounds like a good target audience to me.",

We ordered alot of drinks and they all came to us in a very timely manner, which was very suprising seeing as they were swamped. Our waitress christa went above and beyond to make sure we had what we needed and constantly checked in on us. There wasnt a time where we were sitting around waiting for her to come to us.

There's been a handful of times where certain side items have been questionable, but they've always wiling to remake them for us. The hush puppies and onion rings are our favorites!! Every main dish we've ordered from the menu has been fantastic from build your own burger/ wrap/ chicken sandwich to Reuben, lobster grilled cheese, fish tacos and much more. It tends to get a bit busy/loud here, but if you're OK with that then I'd absolutely recommend giving this place a try.

    "text": "So far we have been twice, and this place is a 2/2 for me and my family.  The atmosphere is great both at 8ish on a Saturday night with live music and at 6 on a week night without.  The first thing that stands out to me is fresh ingredients.  I ordered the Shrimp Scampi pasta dish and the spinach/mushrooms etc were very fresh.  My wife got the buffalo chicken sliders with onion rings and loved them as did I since she couldn't even finish.  For reference the onions ring are done in a batter similar to a \"blooming onion\" you'd see at a franchise steak place.  The appetizer was also good, the fried mac n cheese.  So a meal for 2 with an appetizer ran $35 and that is a great price imo.  The second time we went we brought more family in tow including my picky 3 yo.  Again they didn't disappoint with a great wait staff making the larger party unnoticed.  We tried fried mushrooms as the app and with the ranch and horse radish sauces it was very good.  I tried the Black Angus sliders which were spot on and very filling.   My mother tried the shrimp tacos and they were very good, only complaint that it needed more shrimp (3 each).  Something we noticed the first tome os they have a very nice and diverse kids menu which is refreshing.  My daughter had steamed broccoli, fresh fruit, and a grilled cheese, she was a happy camper.  Their menu is diverse with lots to choose from.  So I plan to continue to work through their menu and I hope they keep up the consistently great service and food.",

Drinks arrived promptly, waitress said she'd return \"in a minute\" to take our appetizer order. Nearly eight minutes later, she returned. We decided to err on the side of caution and order the appetizer and entrees at the same time. When the appetizer came out, we were given no napkins, no silverware and had to ask for small plates. THREE plates (mismatched sizes) were brought out for our party of SIX. Still no napkins or silverware. Food arrived and again, we had to ASK for silverware and napkins. Hard to eat a salad or Mac and Cheese without a fork. Pretty messy to eat wings without napkins. The Cobb salad was served with a paltry two slices of avocado which were hard, they were dark green....the avocado clearly wasn't ripe and should not have been served. The macaroni and cheese that came with one of the kid's meals was inedible. The cheese (which we were told was queso cheese, but it couldn't possibly have been.) was chalky and tasteless. The chicken strips had no seasoning at all. The restaurant was not busy. I don't understand why service was so slow and why the food was so subpar. The server did remove the kid's meal with the Mac and cheese from the bill, but it was too little, too late by that point. We won't be returning any time soon.",

Wait staff are overall awesome however, food constantly come out wrong, cold, late, etc.  The owner, Rhonda, is awesome, attentive and cares.  Love the food, great beer selection and live bands are an added bonus.  I truly think this place will one day rock but the kitchen needs to get it together.",

Roll ahead a few years and here I am extremely pleased.   We got here on a Monday evening and they were reasonably busy. The atmosphere was pleasant and upbeat with a good mix of popular music.   We were sat right away in the newer broken out section. Our drinks were taken and delivered right away. Very tasty mixed drinks. My wife had the Raspberry Lemon Drop.   We shared a dozen medium buffalo wings that were a good size, crispy and saucy.  Great dippers. It was served hot and fast.   The food was well presented and tasty. I had the honey siracha tacos. Yum.   My wife had the tilapia sandwich.  It was tender, flaky, and flavorful.    The kids enjoyed their meals. (Kids hotdog and hamburger with fries)   We all shared the Brookie, a very large brownie/cookie with ice cream and whipped cream, with caramel and chocolate drizzled over top.   All said and done, I am going home with a full belly and happy family. I will be back.",

Cool outside area where the band plays outside occasionally.  Large menu with tons of options.  The food does take some time to come out but it's worth it. The WINGS are the best in town!  Go with the bone-in.  Very friendly staff.  Highly recommend Moochies if you are in Matthews!",

This seems to be more of a local watering hole and probably pretty busy at night by the looks of how beat up the furniture is. The service started off a little slow but the server was very nice and gave honest and good recommendations. I had the wings which were really good and my husband had a chicken wrap with fries. We also had the guacamole and chips to start. We didn't care for the fries or the fact the the bartender sampled some of them when the food was sitting in the kitchen pass window waiting to be delivered to our table. Honestly that bothered me more than him. He was really happy with his wrap and I liked the guacamole however I wish they had warmed up the chips instead of serving them room temperature. I give this place a four because the food was pretty good and despite a slow start our server did a good job and I appreciate that she knew her menu!",

New to the area, maybe a California snob writing here but I wanted to believe...Given that they have an unusual, very long list of taco plates that they just may have tasty tacos? No. I was just reminded that we're not in California anymore. Not worth it. Not even the beans or the rice. It all tasted like spicy old el paso taco mix was added in huge amounts into all of it.  I'd say if you don't know how to cook something, just don't offer it and focus on what you can cook.   If you insist on making those, May I suggest cole slaw for the tacos? Could do wonders! May I suggest a lime on the fish tacos? It will blow your mind!  I heard the burger was ok.",

It was a HUGE Softshell Crab - fried with a great crust, served on a Brioche bun with beautiful leaf lettuce a huge slice of Tomato and some buttery sauce!  Really one of the best ones in my whole life. This is a Steelers Sports Bar..with live music and a huge menu. Their Beer menu is full of great Local Craft beer..including Wooden Robot which I adore! Great Patio area and it is always a fun bar. They are also famous for their Huge Chicken sandwich, which my husband and son got with a Bourbon Butter sauce! They have lots of appetizers and burger and wraps. This place is in a Strip Mall ..Lots of TV's for Sports fanatics too! Try it...its great!",

The waiter said \"thanks for the input we will have to change the frier oil\" I'm not expert but I would think the money is made from drinks but the time to get a beer was what too long. The excuse was \"had to change the tap\".....I was drinking Blue Moon from a bottle!

The place was packed and our waitress was completely swamped. Luckily another waiter was able to jump in and take care of us.  The wedge salad was great and so was the blue cheese dressing. It was full of blue cheese crumbles and tasted homemade. It was excellent especially for the price. My dad really liked his side house salad.  The oyster po boy was my meal. The oysters themselves were fried perfectly but I was turned off by the bread. It tasted like they drenched it in margarine or I can't believe it's not butter. I would also like to see them offer a remoulade to go with the po boy. The fries were terrible and tasted like they used bad oil.  My dad got the Reuben. The meat was sliced extremely thick and much thicker than he had expected. The sandwich itself was average. However he absolutely loved the onion rings and so did I. They were perfectly fried and the breading was great. I don't know how the fries tasted so bad and these tasted so good.  Overall hit or miss. I will give it another try. It seems like there are some really amazing items mixed in with some not so great/average ones.",

The menu is a bit different which soups and sandwiches.  There is heartier fare and entrees to order: fish and chips and steak options on the menus. The app that caught my eye were the truffle deviled eggs which I will be trying soon.  I do miss the large beach chair booths but they used them in their remodel.",

A good ol' blue agave margarita to enjoy the night out. Food was superb!! We all enjoyed our food items but a concern is that one person in our group ordered a cheesesteak but they did not get their order til after the fact the rest of us had everything from appetizers to entree. A simple food item that you would've expect to be out to the table quicker.   They have outside sitting, sitting at the bar or tables. Perhaps some tables may need some TLC as there were two tables we sat at that wobbled. Service was quick and great. I would love to come back and enjoy live performances and the food.",

Please teach your kitchen staff what the menu items are before switching to another new menu. It will help keep you guys open as a restaurant, and not just a nightclub with cover bands.",

They don't have predetermined salad options anymore, just make your own. In a place that's typically very busy, the complications of building your own salad is not a wise business choice. They forgot the 2 of the toppings on the salad (cheese and green peppers) and didn't toss the chicken in the hot sauce. When I picked it up I noticed immediately the chicken was plain. I told the hostess and asked for 2 cups of hot sauce. She brought one. We also ordered wings. I ordered 6 Cajun garlic parm and 6 spicy honey bourbon bbq. The Cajun garlic parm didn't come out as cajun, just garlic parm. The spicy honey bourbon bbq tasted like honey bbq. No spice or bourbon. The wings were also COVERED in feathers. I've never seen wings with that many feathers still on them. I didn't even eat some of them. We were very disappointed in such a simple simple order.",

The food seemed extremely fresh along with the dipping sauces. I would recommend giving this place a try if you have some time to kill and want a good bite to eat!",

The egg on top of mine was overdone... no yoke left so the burger way dry and tasteless. They also forgot my infant daughter's meal which by the way never came. The waitress said she would bring it and the  disappeared for almost 20 minutes. Not a single word of apologies and then get this... they had the audacity of trying to charge me for the food we never received. I will not be back.",

Last Monday we were there and they were very short staffed. If he is going to make it he better get good people working for him.  Lots of turnover. Would love to see him check out Stacks they have great food great service and keep their Waite staff. Not sure what the problem is but better get it fixed.  Won't be back now for a while!",

    "text": "This is not a rating on their food because the food is definitely 5 stars. This is however a rating on my service. I ordered food online for pickup. When I arrived the girl asked for my name and proceeded to go to the kitchen to check on my order. She came back out, grabbed 2 bags from the rack behind her and walked around the hostess stand and handed them to another woman sitting at the table next to the door.  That woman then left.  The hostess then told me they were bagging my food.  Another girl walked out and tried handing me a bag which had 2 meals within (I ordered 4 at a $50 value). I knew it wasn't my bag and told her that. They immediately realized they gave the other woman my food and chased her down in the parking lot. The hostess came back in after exchanging food with the other woman who was already in her car trying to leave and comes back in and gives me the other bags. Really???? Why would they not offer to remake my food. My food left the site of the restaurant with a stranger and no offer to remake. I won't be eating here again after that. I spent $50 for food that left the building with another person only to then be handed to me. McDonald's doesn't even do that.  Shameful!",

Our waiter never even greeted us.  Hostess ended up getting us drinks and took order after we sat for 20 minutes. After 45 minutes our food finally came.  Compound the terrible service with some merry go round of terrible bands going through blasting music way too loud . Couldn't get out of the place quick enough.  Food was good, but kids meal was lukewarm.  Thankfully my kid isn't picky.  Probably won't be back after that experience.    Came again, service was on point.  Food was awesome!  Honey sriracha chicken tacos were wonderful and flavorful.",

Me... never addresses me.... Just took my tea away without asking me or addressing me at all. I didn't want more tea... trying to leave as fast as possible.
