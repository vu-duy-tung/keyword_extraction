Service was prompt and everyone's food came out at the same time. Good selection of items. I sampled the calamari app which as tender and very lightly fried, not overly breaded. Had the filet which was cooked perfectly and very tender and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were also excellent. Had chocolate mousse for dessert that I took home. Rich and creamy! The private dinning room was beautiful and I would recommend it for meetings and presentations!",

Steaks were great but we sent two of the five we ordered back because they were over cooked, so some of us ate while the others watched.  Our server said the appetizer crab cake was prepared differently than the crab cake that came with the steak dinner - it didn't and we ended up with a double serving of the same, an ice-cream sized scoop for $19.95 from the appetizer menu.  I ordered a 12 oz. filet and received an 8 oz.  One of the five half-empty sparkling water glasses was filled with tap water part way through our meal, still not clear why she didn't fill the other four (or ask what was in the glass before she filled one).  No presentation on the plates that you would expect from a dining experience in this price range.",

However, the service is outstanding, which is why I don't give just 3 stars.  I went with some friends on a week night.  I tried the large stone crab claws for an app, double 4oz medallion fillets for main.  I coupled this with a delicious pinot noir (don't remember the name) recommended by our server.  We shared a huge wedge of lemon cake for dessert.  I liked the design of the restaurant with vaulted ceilings.  Sometimes in other chop houses you have lower ceilings and wood paneled chair rails that causes the sound to bounce around.  You have good space between tables but can't carry on a converstaion other than the person next to you.  White table cloths and a sharply dressed wait staff added to the professional ambiance.  On a service note, I did appreciate the concerted effort in serving food and removing dishes.  This isn't an everyday place to eat at but certainly fun for special occasions and business outtings.  Will have to come back again soon.",

    "text": "My fiancee and I went here a couple nights ago with some friends for Restaurant Week. Let me first say that, having worked in the service industry before, I'm very aware that Restaurant Week can be hectic, so any review I give will have taken these things into consideration. That being said, our experience here was awful.  Given that it was Restaurant Week, there was a predetermined menu of items to choose from for appetizer, entree, and dessert. To start out, when we placed our order, my friend asked if there was any way we could get a soup instead of a salad (their only appetizers were salads and a few of us didn't eat salad). They said they wouldn't swap anything out. So we both (myself included) ended up ordering a salad that neither of us ate. When the salad did arrive, the server reached over me to serve my fiancee her salad and he clearly had not been bothered to apply deodorant that morning. Needless to say, it was rather unpleasant.  For me, the worst part of the night was when my fiancee (who happens to be vegetarian) asked what vegetarian options they could come up with for an entree since they had no vegetarian options on their Restaurant Week menu. After speaking with the chef, they came back and said that she could have 3 vegetables from their side items menu as her entree. Seriously?! A high-end restaurant with an executive chef can't come up with some pasta dish or something creative for a vegetarian?! So my fiancee ate mashed potatoes, asparagus, and some mediocre macaroni and cheese. This just showed a total lack of preparation and care on their part and severely ruined my opinion on Del Frisco's. Had she been vegan, fine.. I get that could be difficult, but vegetarians are fairly common nowadays. How could you not have some backup plan for them?  In addition to the poor lack of preparation, the service was pretty poor. Our water glasses, while not empty for too long, were still empty numerous times throughout our meal. And since the server and moved the bottle of wine that we'd ordered to a wine chiller against the wall and was routinely gone from the table for lengthy periods of time, I had to get up and get the bottle myself to poor my fiancee and me some more wine.   The only silver lining in our entire experience was the dessert. While the cheesecake was fairly poor (everyone at our table was disappointed in it), I ordered the banana bread pudding cake and it was incredible.  Honestly, if you're going to spend this kind of money, there are plenty of much better options in the Charlotte area. Needless to say, we likely we not be returning, and will likely point any friends in another direction when looking for a nice place to eat.",

The service was impeccable and our waiter was super friendly and did a great job explaining the menu. The steak was fantastic and cooked perfectly. My husband had the special Cajun tuna which was very under seasoned. All of the sides are served family style and we especially enjoyed the shaved Brussels sprouts and lobster macaroni and cheese. The onion rings do not belong on the menu. They are huge and tasteless. It is hard to have  conversation  due to the high ceilings and quite expensive but a wonderful place for a special occasion",

That wasn't a problem.  We ordered and were brought two separate salads, an extra plate for entree and a 2 spoons for dessert.   The filet medallions were superb.  And the banana bread pudding to die for.   Service was out of this world.   I ordered a drink the server gave me this face and said not my favorite and a lot of people don't care for but you should try, if you don't like we will get you something else.   Sure enough I hated set it to the side she came by and said what else should we try.   She was great.",

    "text": "This was my second time dining at Del Frisco's in Charlotte, NC. Both times I have left pleased with the experience. This night was a dinner for my wife for Mother's Day and a birthday dinner for my brother. We arrived a little early and decided to have a drink at the bar, a nice old fashioned started off the meal right. after only 10 minutes or so we were shown to our table on the upper level of the restaurant. The restaurant sits in a lovely area known as South Park and it really is a nice building. \"Old\" dark wood, brass, huge windows, etc. give an impression of elegance and adds to the ambience.  The meal started with 3 appetizers of Sesame Tuna cooked perfectly with two sauces of soy/ginger, 1/2 dozen of raw oysters (they were ok), and the beef Carpaccio topped with micro greens and a creamy sauce. Tuna by far was the best app. The entrees arrived and the steaks were again cooked perfectly (12oz ribeye, dry aged Strip). I ordered the veal porterhouse, but they were out of that as well as the Wagyu beef, so there was a bit of a disappointment in that I had to go to choice number 3, the double cut lamb chops. They were good mind you, cooked great, but I really wanted that wagyu beef! We ordered the family style asparagus and the other worldly lobster mac and cheese as sides. Guys, that lobster mac-n-cheese is something pretty awesome and deserves a shout out all on it's own.  We washed the meal down with a bottle of Cade Cabernet Sauvignon. Dessert? Yes sure of course! She ordered the Strawberry Roman (basically some vanilla ice cream with Gran Marnier and fresh strawberries), He ordered the chocolate cake, as my brother is a world renowned certified chocoholic! I opted for a glass of the 1908 D'Oliverias Boal madeira. That's right a glass of 107yr old dessert wine! Super good stuff and certainly topped off a memorable evening. Now it definitely wasn't cheap, as the bill approached $600 with the tip, but in life you have to live every now and then.  You need to go there and live a little bit too, I know I'll do it again.",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to do a night on the town and got a car and driver and made reservations at Del Frisco's.  I had told my husband what a great meal and great service I received when my daughter and I had gone there on July 4th and he had been anxious to try it out ever since.  The evening did not start out well, as the driver was almost a half an hour late and I thought that it would put a damper on the entire night.  Once we arrived, due to our tardiness, we had to wait a bit; so we decided to have cocktails at the bar... Ray, the bartender immediately lifted our spirits with his jovial mood and great cocktails - I am not really sure if his jokes were exceptionally funny or if the drinks were just really good. But we were seated without a very long wait, and we were almost sad to leave our new bartender friend.  Our server was professional, yet friendly and even knew that we were from Southern California based on notes that Buddy, the GM had taken when my daughter and I had dined there.  My husband ordered the ribeye, but they had a special that I decided to try, which was the bone-in filet...  The Bone-in Filet  THE BONE-IN FILET!!!  T H E   B O N E - I N - F I L E T!!!!!!!!!!!!  Did I mention the frickin' BONE-IN FILET????  Enough said!!!! One of the best steaks I have ever had and we dine out a lot and frequent many high end restaurants.  This steak was seasoned and cooked to medium-rare PERFECTION. And although my husband's ribeye was tasty... T H E   B O N E - I N - F I L E T is the steak that young cows still grazing in fields aspire to become!!!  The only down side of our visit was that Buddy was not working, so I didn't get to introduce my husband to him as I had hoped to do. However, I am not concerned about making introductions, because as my husband continually dipped onto my plate to help me eat T H E   B O N E - I N - F I L E T, there was a gleam in his eye that told me that he would soon return for one of his very own and he could meet Buddy then.",

I made reservation for 9:30pm because it was the closest time to 7pm that was available.  Fine enough, must mean it is worth the wait...  Not so much.  We waited over 30 minutes for a table.  They did bring out a few appetizers to sample for the crowd that was waiting, so nice effort, but it was extremely salty and not very tasty.    Upon seating, we decided to order off the menu (which our waitress told us was rare for the night - everyone wanted the $30 prix fixe).  It started out decent enough.  Tomato-mozzerella salads are hard to get wrong.  The crab cake was unlike our mid-Atlantic palets were used to, but we liked it.  Until we found a hair in it.  Ooops.  The server apologized, the manager apologized, the food was comped.  All is well.  Our dinner was average.  My boyfriend's steak was good (8 oz filet), but I've had some pretty amazing scallops in my life and these didn't even crack the top 20 (Whole Foods serves better scallops).  Definitely not worth $33.    Desert was a strawberry cheesecake concoction.  Decent, but nothing I can't find anywhere else.  Overall, the service was okay, the food was average, but it definitely wasn't worth the wait, the price, or the overall experience.  Crowd is somewhat \"trendy\"...we wore jeans with nice tops, but I would probably suggest casual pants for the male contigency.",

    "text": "Great steaks & ambience, but lacking everywhere else.  Full disclosure, we went on New Year's Eve so exceptional service wasn't expected to begin with, but our server was ridiculously pretentious and it didnt start the night off well.    The steaks were prepared very well and were everything we expected, but then the side dishes were awful.  Asaparagus was under cooked and when we ordered \"skillet potatoes and onions\" we weren't expecting them to be fried to the point of being potato chips.  Granted, they were good potato chips, but not exactly something your pair with a fine steak and good wine.  This is a chain restaurant, and for being at the same price-point of Ruth's Chris, I'll choose to spend my money there instead.",

    "text": "Good steak in Charlotte? I was craving some meat and about to find out how they do it down here. Coming here on a rainy Friday night, we grabbed a valet to park our car. Given an umbrella and went inside. Nice fancy looking restaurant. More open with 2 floors and lots of glass windows as opposed to your standard boys club stuffy wall street steakhouses.   Not to say anything is wrong with that but a nice change of pace. We were brought to a table on the second floor and this is pretty much when things started looking real good. Waitress was top notch, service friendly, attentive without being pushy. Explained everything on the menu, including the degree of redness in the cut when asking for medium rare which some ppl might take as offensive if they know their steak and assume it's an insult to their knowledge. I, however, think it's a nice attention to detail and being to many steakhouses, I know that medium rares vary widely from place to place even though they shouldn't and it's good to know right off the bat they are going to bring you what you want.  The specials at this place are insane! Prix fixe power couple special is 99 for 2 ppl for salad, filet mignon plus crab cake, a side and dessert! And my favorite cut being ribeye for it's flavor I was able to substitute a 12 oz ribeye for an 8 oz filet mignon for no extra charge. Hell yeah! Also it being Friday night, there was a half off bottle special (on select bottles of course) and half off glasses of wine. That is just too great. Most of the time specials are saved for weekday nights when business is slow but a Friday night? Unheard of. Food was great. Caesar salad was tossed very well and everyone knows a good toss is needed. Ribeye was flavorful and cooked to perfection. When it was brought out they asked us to cut into it to assure it was cooked to our liking before walking away. I have seen this done at some steakhouses but not all high end steakhouses and it's always appreciated especially since we had 4 steaks and all were cooked to the right temp already.   No sauce on the table meaning they expect the steak to stand on its own.  Dessert was good, my father in laws bday so they hooked him up with a dessert. Another high point was that they didn't get him just a pre selected standard dessert but let him choose off the regular dessert menu and it came out with a candle and everything with a standard happy bday and no embarrassing scene. Definitely recommend the molten chocolate cake. This restaurant definitely has it going on and I will have to visit the one in New York to see if the southern hospitality carries over.",

    "text": "I can't believe no one has reviewed Del Frisco's yet.  Perhaps no Yelper feels it needs a review, since it easily does well in the paper and other official reviews around town, and everyone \"knows\" that it's good.  But, I feel like it needs to be done, if only to get me more compliments, and \"1st reviewer stars\".    When you walk in to Del Frisco's, you know you'll be paying a lot for the dinner you're about to have.  Rest assured, however, that it will be very delicious. It's worth at least a visit for a drink or two to see the beautiful staircase, dark woods, wine cellar, and beautiful windows with views of SouthPark, if you can't afford to have an entire meal there.  They certainly captured the look of a luxurious high-end steakhouse.  If you do choose to dine at Del Frisco's, you will not be disappointed.  We've eaten there twice--once on our own tab to celebrate our recent move to Charlotte, and the second time with my husband's parents--and both times we left saying it was the best steak we'd ever had.  Both times I had a filet.  The first time, I had an 8 oz filet that was like cutting through warm butter. I believe in the power of the rare steak, since the flavors seem to be bigger and brighter (and in less refined establishments, it ensures that your steak is fresh and not someone else's mistake).  This steak was perfectly cooked, well-seasoned, and a total 5-star steak.  The second steak I got was a 6-oz filet from the \"Lagniappe\" section ('small surprise for the customer') that included the Chateau potatoes. The steak was again ridiculously delish.  Steaks can run around $40, which seems reasonable, but this generally does not include a side.  Del Frisco's serves their side dishes family style, so they are ordered for the table since the portions are large enough for three or more.  Dishes in their \"Lagniappe\" section come with Chateau potatoes (barely-mashed potatoes, almost like the filling of twice-baked potatoes).  I wasn't the biggest fan of these; they were a little dry.  Other side dishes I have had and enjoyed a lot were the sweet potato casserole with crumble topping and the asparagus.    The cocktails deserve a section of their own here.  My husband got a VIP cocktail, pineapple-y and smooth, and it was fabulous!  I ordered a Cosmopolitan, because I always channel my inner Carrie Bradshaw via alcohol and shoes, and this one was certainly no disappointment!  Jim's parents had Manhattans, and loved them--believe me when I say, they know a good Manhattan!  The service has always been excellent. The staff is very knowledgeable, visit the table frequently to check on drinks, and really friendly.  At the end of the meal, they will give you a card to fill out your address and information, and a few days later, you will get a Thank-You card in the mail from them personally!  I was shocked the first time that happened!  Our waitress even alluded back to our conversation with her during our dinner--a real pro!  Overall, I would say that Del Frisco's is one of the best dining experiences I have had.  There is no rushing through the meal, it's a beautiful atmosphere, and you are made to feel like a VIP through the whole experience.  Definitely a great date night, and you can make reservations on-line at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a>.",

There is nothing better then sitting at a rich wood paneled bar drinking a first rate scotch to put you in a good mood and feeling all is well with the world.   I agree with Megan, this is a top steak house for Charlotte (part of a chain, that are all good). I have had several dinners here plus I have eaten at the bar (there is a bar special prior to 6PM).  All the food is very good and the service is excellent. There is a small steak plate that is very good and also is inexpensive, but at least once go for the big ?? oz. steak. The drinks are generous, my scotch on the rocks looked like a double to me. They also have a frequent drinker/eater card. I am not sure what you do with all the credits. but when I cash mine in I will update my comments.",

    "text": "The 4 stars is more for the food than for the service.  We went this past weekend with a party of 10 for a special event.  The food overall was very good.  We had the strip steak, rib eye, filet mignon, tuna steak, lamb and several sides.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  The steaks were as good as the ones that I have had at the other top steakhouses in Charlotte.  The desserts were excellent too.  Although I don't have any complaints regarding the food, the service was hit or miss.  The service that I received at other comparably priced restaurants in Charlotte was much better. It was not what I expected for such a high priced place.   I found it sub par because of the following:  It was a very, very long wait for the food. I was about to lose my appetite.  It may not have been the server's fault, but she never told us why it was taking so much time.  In fact, she didn't check on us as much as expected.  I had to look for her.  We had several children with us and they can't wait up to an hour to eat.  Another detail that I found unusual for such a high-end restaurant was that the server didn't explain the items on the menu.  I had to ask her to go over the menu options which is usually done automatically at an expensive steak house.  She may have had an off night and did not seem interested in giving us the attention that one deserves when paying  hundreds of dollars for a meal.  I have eaten several times at the Palm Restaurant down the street from Del Friscos and they give you the total dining experience.  The better half of the service included several comped desserts for the special occasion. They handled the special request concerning the billing and we also brought our own cake which they took care of.  It is a beautiful restaurant to celebrate a special event and the service should match the food and surroundings.",

My son was treating his dad for fathers day, after waiting another 15 minutes after the bill was delivered, he decided to just take the bill to a manager because we had to go. He met the server at the steps as he was going to find a manager to take the credit card.  He gave her his card and our ticket for the valet.  When she returned with his card, she asked him if the card that he gave her was his card.  Not sure why she was asking WHY.

I ordered the Filet Oscar style. Our steaks were cooked to perfection. We indulged in a bottle of wine, Trefethen Double T, which was opened by the house sommelier.   I did spot the dessert I ordered being delivered to the table next to me and notices that it had nuts on it. The menu didnt list this and I am very allergic. The server offered me sorbet in place of it. I was slightly disappointed that the menu didnt say pecan crusted because that is a very common allergy. I so suggest that they add that to the menu from now on!   We didnt feel rushed in anyway. We toom our time to enjoy our wine. The atmosphere was wonderful and even with a packed restaurant it wasnt too loud!!   We will return for sure :)",

He was attentive, funny and took the absolute best care of us.   I am a creature of habit and generally order the same thing everywhere I go. Why fix what isn't broken? I selected the crab cakes for my appetizer...nothing but the perfect seasoning and lump crab meat! No fillers! Our friends had calamari which had a great flavor, too.  Then Tyler appears with shrimp cocktail for my birthday! The shrimp were HUGE and tasty. It was such a sweet gesture, too.   For my entree, I had a ribeye with oscar topping(yes, they will top steaks other than filets)! Because it was my birthday, I was charged with selecting side items. I went with corn and shaved Brussels sprouts. My steak was perfection. I have never had a bad one. Sides were great as usual.   It was my birthday so I knew one dessert was on the house. But Tyler remembered us from before and that we loved the butter cake. He came to the table with TWO for us, on the house. Another sweet gesture.   I love Del Frisco's. Always 5 stars for me!",

    "text": "O.M.G. THE BONE-IN RIBEYE IS DIVINE. It simply raises the benchmark upon which all other steaks are measured, it is THAT heavenly.  The way they season the steak is so incredible that it makes all other steaks seem naked.  It's like flying business class on a flat bed; economy just seems anticlimactic and lackluster once you've had a taste.  As a carnivorous steak lover, since eating here, every steak I've had just \"isn't AS GOOD as Del Frisco's.\"    4.5 stars and rounding up to 5 because that elusive 5-star restaurant rating implies perfection.  4.5 star rating for: fabulous ambience, stellar service, wonderful food.    Parking: there's complimentary valet by a third-party company that also serves the other restaurants.  It can be a little slow but that's not within Del Frisco's control.    FABULOUS AMBIENCE. It's located in a roundabout.  They have a patio outside and as a lover of outside dining, it seemed like an afterthought, like a red-headed stepchild -- a mere obligatory presence.  Inside, it's quite upscale; there are two floors with a rather grand-esque staircase. There are large-scale floor-to-ceiling windows. The decor is traditional contemporary dressed with dark wood walls and white linen tables.    STELLAR SERVICE.  The service is done in pairs, which creates a seamless transition between courses, your drinks are refilled consistently and you have what you need, when you need it.  Chuck was our server; he was prompt, attentive, courteous and truly went out of his way to ensure that we had a pleasant and enjoyable dining experience.  We indicated that our lobster bisque was too salty and he proceeded to have it taken off our check.  It's like Nordstrom, if they stand behind their products, it instills trust and customer confidence.  You may be paying a little more but it's worth it.  On our second visit, we got the same level of superb service and attention.    WONDERFUL FOOD. In general, the cuisine is artfully prepared and delicious.  They start off with warm sesame-covered bread and butter, which is good (I like Capital Grille's bread basket better). We had:   Alcohol.  Heavy alcohol pour but still mixed deliciously.   AMAZING:  +++  bone-in ribeye.  It's a big portion that my BF and I ended up taking home (but we did order a few appetizers). The steak is tender, moist, and juicy but the seasoning -- it is coated with blissful seasoning that is evenly and skillfully distributed throughout the steak, even on the bone. It was SO good, I gnawed all the seasoning and meat off the bone in the privacy of my home the next day and gave the bone to my Yorkie to further enjoy.    VERY GOOD:   +++ crab claws: we were told that ordering these at the beginning of the season are best.  THEY ARE BOMB with the mustard!   +++  Alaskan king crab: fresh, sweet and very meaty.  They serve them with butter sitting over a flame so it doesn't harden.  +++  deconstructed caesar salad. Steakhouses really know how to deliver on their caesar dressing, which is a nice blend of creamy, lemony and salty from the hint of anchovy.   +++  oysters.  The oysters are fresh and buttery, not briny at all.   +++  shrimp cocktail.  The shrimps were plump and succulent and great with the tangy cocktail sauce with a kick to it.  The portion is most generous between Capital Grille (5), BLT (4) or Bentley's on 27 (3). +++  cheesecake.  The cheesecake is fluffy; one part cheesecake, one part whipped with white chocolate infused in it.  It's perfectly sweet; not too rich.  GOOD:  +++  escargot.  This is a very watered-down version and would be considered entry-level escargot.  The cream is pretty good but I found it to be a little bland for my taste (Bentley on 27 has the consummate flavor).   PASS:  ---  Lobster bisque.  My favorite in Charlotte is at Capital Grille. This was way too salty and I LOVE salt. I think it may have been an off night because I can't imagine what we had was their recipe.  The lobster was very fresh and sweet but the overly saltiness killed it.    STEAKHOUSE COMPARISON.  Which steakhouse?  Del Frisco's, BLT or Capital Grille?  Each national chain has its idiosyncratic flair and is good for different reasons.   BLT. Trendy upscale contemporary twist; has a fusion undertone; steak served on a skillet, has garlic flower, herbed butter and delicious steak sauce. Pre-dinner popovers and chicken pate.  No patio.  Del Frisco's.  More traditional upscale; has French influence; steak is thoroughly marinated and served with outside layer of seasoning. Pre-dinner sesame bread. Patio seems like an after thought. Capital Grille.  More casual traditional country club vibe; steak is marinated but served bare. Pre-dinner bread basket. I love the patio there.   Overall, we will definitely be back because I seriously can't imagine steak any other way.  Del Frisco's aptly sets the bar for how steak should be served and is absolutely worth the hefty price tag.  My mouth is watering just thinking of that foodgasmic steak...",

I had the uber fantastic seared chilean sea bass. It was served atop a bed of crab fried rice and an incredible black bean garlic sauce. It was one of the best fish dishes I've ever had.   BOTTOM LINE: Del Frisco is fantastic in every way... even when you're not ordering steak.",

    "text": "We came here last night for my husband's  birthday. This place is definitely a splurge/special occasion type!  We were immediately seated and given some delish bread and menus. The wine list is crazy extensive. Our waiter helped us pick from the 3 options we narrowed down to. We decided on a Zinfandel that was absolutely delicious.  To start we got the lobster bisque and the Del's salad. The lobster bisque was crazy rich with a good amount of lobster chunks in it. The salad was probably the highlight of the starters. The avocado dressing on it was perfection and that thick cut bacon just made the salad!   For our mains, I got the 8oz filet mignon and my husband got the ribeye. I think we decided the filet was better. Though, both steaks were superb. Perfectly cooked medium rare with some tasty spices on top. We split the side special for the night which was lobster mashed potatoes. A good amount of lobster chunks in it. This side was amazing!   For dessert we got the chocolate souffle (I believe the comp'd the dessert for my husbands birthday). I was nursing a liquid dessert of Frangelico (on a side note, I asked if they could warm it. Since they didnt have a microwave, they brought out this candle contraption to warm it up...so cool!) so I only had a bite or two of the dessert. Crazy chocolaty and rich!   Absolutely amazing meal. I was also very much impressed with service. The food was spaced out very well and I think half the waiters in the restaurant said happy birthday to my husband (I had simply noted it on our reservation). Such a fantastic evening!",

From the hostess to the manager and everything in between.  Service was phenomenal and the food matched the service. We both got the filet, husband got the lobster bisque and I got a salad. Couldn't pass up dessert so we got the amazing banana bread pudding. The staff that brought the entrees out didn't leave the table until you approve the temperature of the steak. The manager came around twice during our meal and made sure we were happy. I can't say enough about this place. After a terrible wine and dine experience at Ruth's Cris - This renewed my faith in fine dining. We will be back!",

Tonight they returned to announce to our family that my sister is pregnant. We made a reservation for 8:30 and showed up an HOUR early. When 8:45 came around we were told we'd have an additional 30 minute wait (as we proceeded to see multiple parties of the same size be sat in front of us).  My newly pregnant sister couldn't wait until after 9pm to eat and we left.  We ended up leaving and walking to another steak restaurant, completely ruining the surprise for my parents.   I understand that the PGA is in town and it was busy but when someone has spent five figures at your restaurant and notes that they're spending another special occasion at your restaurant, I'd make sure to take care of that customer.",

I placed my order at 8:50 p.m. 1 lemon cake, 1 chocolate mousse, and 1 pineapple upside down cake. My order was not brought out until 9:34 p.m. ALL of the deserts were horrible!!! Lemon cake was wet as if it had been defrosted inside of a microwave, the pineapple upside down cake was their butter cake with crushed pineapples smashed into it, and the chocolate mousse was disgusting. I threw every dessert into the garbage as they were unfit for human consumption. Additionally, as I stood patiently waiting for my order near the bar, I observed waiters, waitresses, and the bartender scratching their faces, picking their noses, wiping sweat from their brows, and scratching their scalps ALL without washing their hands as they continued to make drinks and bus tables after using their bare hands to make drinks and add garnish to those drinks. Nasty! NASTY!!! NASTY!!! Customer beware!!!",

I ordered the filet, medium and it came out hot, fresh, seasoned well and juicy. The butter and chive sauce that accompanied the baked potato left no room for sour cream or any other additive. The service was impeccable and the wine suggestions were on par. I would definitly recommend and will be returning in the future :)",

Here are my tips if your going there.      -Don't go with a group of more than four.    -Request a table downstairs, the upstairs area is more like a sports bar than the opulent dining room downstairs.  Also, we  have ALWAYS had bad service up there, don't know why.     -Try sitting at a bar table if you can, during happy hour they have great food specials that are more inventive than the appetizers on the regular menu.    We really do love this place when it's on, but when they are off its a really expensive long off.  The last time we were there it was a party of 8.  My fish was served cold, we had to get up and get the waiter to come to back to our table to actually take our order.  Several peoples steaks were't cooked right.  The waiter also upsold us on the sides.  He told us for the amount of people we had we needed two of each side we ordered, seriously we had so much left overs it required to multiple bags to take home.",

My parents had been here before and they had never raved about it, but when my friend group suggested to try it for restaurant week, I was up for it. I understand restaurant week may mean a lower price point, especially for steak houses, but with the volume that they get in reservations, I am sure it all evens out. Our reservation was at 8:45 and since the entire party did not get there until 9, we were seated around 9:10. We were led all the way downstairs to the basement wine cellar where there were about 5 other tables. A really confusing part of our evening was the fact that we had about 4 different people attending our table - only one of them was nice. We asked for bread, and one of the waiters THREW it on the table in front of the person who had asked. So incredibly rude, appalling and horrifying!   With the 3 course menu & 2 glasses of wine and tip it was almost 80 dollars - which I will happily pay at Ruth's Chris or The Palm where the service is always flawless and outstanding. The food was good - not going to lie, but it was overshadowed by the terrible way we were treated. I have never experienced such horrible service and rudeness from waiters! I can understand their stress for restaurant week, but it truly ruined our night. Please Del Frisco's - do not participate in restaurant week if you do not have the proper staff for it. Our night would have been a great night if we had just been treated with respect.",

The seafood platter appetizer is excellent.  Ask for the VIP (a special off-menu pineapple martini).  The wait staff is friendly and the sommelier is very knowledgeable and has great wine recommendations.  The atmosphere is quite interesting.  Rick Flair always seems to be at chilling at the bar there.  It's also fairly common to see star athletes dine there.  Their Wednesday happy hour seems to attract a lot of good looking women for some reason.  All these things makes for an interesting people watching scene.",

Au Gratin potatoes have bacon flavoring. Very tasty. Lobster Mac & Cheese very good too.  The soups are average.  I had the chicken & sausage. My wife had the seafood soup. Nothing special.  This place is rather noisy.  We had 8 people at our table. Hard to hear people at the other end of the table.  And yes, this place is very expensive. Bring your trust fund.",

I will set the scene for you--me, Montes Wine and Del Frisco's--two of my loves coming together for one night in Charlotte.  A girl just simply couldn't ask for more.  When I first learned about the dinner I had to get a sneak peek of the pairings.  One has to be prepared for such things.  I was willing to starve myself for a full week in preparation for all the eating and drinking I intended to do.  A mouth watering four course dinner along with an appetizing reception was set for the Montes Winery Dinner at the Charlotte location of Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse.  If you have not gone to a wine dinner at Del Frisco's you really don't know what you are missing!  You are missing a lot.",

This place is gorgeous and we were seAted in a lovely booth. We started off with their plate of sesame bread and smooth butter and their succulent crab cake with tons of lump meat. I also had the del salad with creamy avocado dressing, bacon, and tomatoes. My son had lobster Mac which was one of their sides. It was very rich and creamy, just how you would imagine it to be, son loved it, but too rich for my blood. Hubby ordered the 12 oz filet with peppercorn sauce cooked medium rare. Looked beautiful, tasted heavenly, a little on the seasoned side though but melted in your mouth. The sauce was overpowering though, although on the side, a little dab will do you.    I ordered their special, sea bass with pesto fingerling potatoes and balsamic cherry tomatoes. The fish was cooked perfectly! Skin was left on for crunch And seAled in flavor but I don't prefer eating the skin so I peeled it off. It was a juicy buttery fish with cooked center how I like it.  For dessert we had creme brulee and took home their lemon layer cake. The creme brulee is Belgian white chocolate with some hint of cinnamon to it, nice and creamy but I have had better. The lemon cake is just right. Not too heavy, not too sweet. The icing is like glaze on a lemon bundt cake, the cake isn't too rich. Very good!  Service was great! We had a cute young waitress and this place was popping for a Thursday night at 5:45!  Def recommend!",

High ceilings, rich woods, classy well-dressed staff.  We arrived a little late unfortunately but only had to wait for a few minutes - some of our party arrived earlier but they were told they only seat everyone once the entire party arrives. They were able to sit out on the patio area until the entire group showed up. It was a beautiful evening so no worries in that department.   We ordered the \"Power Couple\" for $99 you had your choice of the Del's salad (with amazing avocado dressing and thick sliced bacon), or a Caesar. I went with the Del's which was delicious and very big - definitely larger than your average side salad. The main entree was an 8oz filet mignon and a huge lump crab cake. The filet was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious, and the crab cake was rich and filled with tons of crab (the least amount of filler I've had in a cake). Next we had our choice of sides which were served family style (our whole table had some of each of the sides). I loved the chateau potatoes served with white pepper and whole sauteed mushrooms. Finally we ended the deal with a choice of amazing desserts. Luckily my group all likes to share and the portions are HUGE so I tried the cheesecake (wow), bread pudding, and chocolate mousse.  We went with their featured wine selection which was a Benziger Cabernet. I loved the wine and it went perfect with my steak!   For $50 per person you absolutely cannot beat this deal - the portions alone are worth coming as you easily can make two meals out of this.   I cannot say enough about the service- fantastic! Everyone was so attentive and went out of their way to make my day great. I swear I was wished a happy birthday by six different staff members! They serve at a slower relaxed pace which was perfect for our group as we are talkers. When they cleared the first round of plates I honestly heard \"be our guest\" playing in my head - five servers clearing plates at once is a sight to behold !  I will absolutely be back as this has been one of the nicest dining experiences I have ever had. Thank you Del Friscos !",

Let's start with the scenery the restaurant is beautiful two floors in a wide open space and a great bar area.  We lucked out with a really great corner booth and a great waitress. For me it's not an every night dinner kind of place only because I could never afford it, but for a great date this is the place to go.   I ordered the filet and au gratin potatoes each plate came out hot and were cooked perfectly.  A dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives oh yeah.   Del Frisco's is a great treat if your looking for somewhere really nice for dinner I would put this place in my top 5.",

However, it isn't so much wasting it as it is enjoying the finer things in life...or just seeing, even for a brief fleeting moment, how the other half lives.   Might I suggest the Prime PorterHouse? 24 ounces baby...Go big or go home...what, you thought I was gonna recommend the chicken breast in a place like this? Get real. Any of their sides that include cheese in the name, whether it is spelled in French or English, are winners (Mac N' Cheese and Potatoes Au Gratin). Ok, so I just googled \"gratin\" and it doesn't mean cheese; it means \"with pan scrapings, or gratings\". Sounds better than cheese, right? Basically, load up on starches and red meat, doctor's orders. I'm just kidding...I'm not a real doctor. But my dad is a cardiologist, so my future inheritance will thank you for taking my menu recommendations to heart....literally.   Let's be honest, this is a high end steakhouse, and with that label comes the typical smattering of schmucks who think they are better than the rest of the world, but for some reason, every time I've come here, whether it be for drinks, dinner, what-have-you, I have always had a great time dealing with down-to-earth servers, bartenders, and management.  Far better than some of the other high end joints in town.  Maybe I just got lucky?   Ah Del Friscos...you actually get 4.5 stars in my book...you lose half a star due to the fact that I get jealous that I can't enjoy you as much as some folks in the world, and I don't like feelings of jealousy towards my fellow man. Bad Karma.",

We had a reservation but when we got there we still had to wait 5-10 minutes for our table. I was really shocked the manager walked by us several times and didn't even say hi. When we got out table it was completely unstable. When any amount of wait was put on it the table would drastically tilt to that side. Our waiter was nice but other than the steak being cooked right the food wasn't that impressive. The creamed spinach was pretty flavorless and the onion rings were unmanageable do to their size. It's cool that they are huge but from a eating perspective it makes that hard to do. We ended up barely touching them. Sadly, we didn't get to mention any of our concerns because while the manager did walk by several times, he failed to stop by our table even once.",

Honestly, for my money I'd rather go to Ruth's Chris, which is right across the street.  This is just my opinion, but I think the steaks are better, and the price is better.  They're both high end steak houses, but there's a certain pretentiousness that I feel at Del Frisco's that I just don't get at other steak houses, almost like if you don't order pre-dinner cocktails, good wine, a large steak and a few sides then you're not doing your reservation justice.  Don't get me wrong, Del Frisco's was a more than adequate meal.  Service was on the ball, the food was very good.  But for me?  I'd take my steak dollars elsewhere.",

Let's be honest, the rent on the space they occupy is enormously high, and the only way they are breaking even is by charging astronomical prices for very mediocre food.  I can't fault them, and they have a great atmosphere and customer base, so more power to them. But do not come here if you want good food. Come here if you want to wine and dine or impress, as that is the only thing that is worth the price tag of the bill at the end of the night.",

After saying all of this I must add one small complaint.. I arrived a little earlier than the rest of my party this year and ordered a sweet tea at the bar for the wait. The bartender handed me the tea and then told me it was $4.32!! Haha!! I quickly asked if there was alcohol in it, which there was not. I paid the man under the impression that I was about to have a glass of perfection, the nectar of the gods, at the very least the best damn sweet tea known to man!! Sadly it wasn't even homemade. Hopefully they can fix this little hiccup. I figure when they know you are about to spend a lot on dinner they can swing the price of a fountain drink.  Now to end on a positive note I would recommend this place to everyone who is looking for fantastic food and a great dining experience.",

Sent up another manager, the Wine Sommelier and revisited our table one last time for good measure.    Steak was delicious, as was the spinach.  Had a delicious bottle of wine and enjoyed our meal thoroughly.  It was expensive as all hell, and don't expect to spend less than a $150 if you're drinking (our bill was considerably more than that).  If the manager does swing by your table and you get to chat, ask him to show you their private wine cellar in the basement.

    "text": "I saved my 100th review for del Frisco's for a reason! This place is so special to me and my husband. Our first experience was at the DF in NYC and we haven't been able to stop since then. When we moved to Charlotte, we were beyond thrilled when we found out there was a DF here. We weren't sure if it would live up to our expectations. NYC was beautiful and grand and the food was fantastic, as usual. We had a completely different experience at the DF in Las Vegas. Don't get me wrong, the food was great, but the restaurant itself was seriously lacking the DF grandeur with it's low tiled ceiling and lack of windows. Then came Charlotte and we were not disappointed! It's just like the one in NYC, but facing Fairview and Piedmont Row instead of 6th Ave.  We've been to this location a lot and the service here is excellent. The hostess are always really friendly and accommodating. We normally get there before our reservation to start out the bar for a cocktail then head to our table once it's ready. Again, the service is excellent. When we were here during our Charlotte scouting trip, our service went above and beyond to sing praises of Charlotte and even wrote out a list of things we should check out once we moved to Charlotte. Very sweet. As usual, he food is delicious. The wine list is extensive and impressive. I always find something that I like. We usually start out with the crab cake appetizer or we each get salads. The crab cake is one of the best I've ever had and my favorite salad is the Del's Salad. Our entrees always vary. Sometimes steak, sometimes fish, sometimes I'll even have the crab cakes again for my entree (they're that good). We'll normally order two sides - a carb and a vegetable. One thing I really really wish they had was the cauliflower gratin that, I think, they only serve at the DF in NYC. No matter what, we save room for lemon cake for dessert. Even if it means we take a slice to go. We've been known to even have a slice at the restaurant and have one to go for the following day. Neither one of us are huge lemon flavored dessert fans, but this cake has us singing a different tune.   This restaurant is one of our favorites and I'm so glad we have one in the city in which we now live!",

    "text": "Date night with flair !  Enjoyed a fabulously seasoned and prepared filet with garlic mashed and asparagus. Not even a crumb left. Even the cheesecake was some of the best I've had.Best wine selection this side of Pluto !  Dined in the wine cellar, which I didn't even know existed (tucked away with an escalator in the corner) Was very quiet, and intimate as there are only about ten tables downstairs. The wine cellar wraps around three walls of the entire room, and private restrooms downstairs as well. Also much quieter than the main large upstairs open dining room with a large bar and  nice view (huge floor to ceiling windows) of the Piedmont Row neighborhood adjacent to Southpark Mall (great shopping) and a mezzanine level with bar also I believe (was crowded on a Friday evening) Recommend reservations or there will be a significant wait(thus the large bars...lol)   Valet parking available, but huge parking deck across the driveway always has ample spaces available. There is usually a celeb or two in the house, so, dress to impress...   In summary, food , wine , ambiance and service spectacular !  Pricey, but you get what you pay for these days.. Bon Appetit !  PS: Got a Thank You card from the waiter a few days later.. That's a first !       Do you think the sixty dollar tip was too much ?          Woooooooo",

    "text": "Beautiful place!!!  The building is impressive, service too.  Rich uncle took me and the family, he frequents the place.  We were there on a Tuesday evening and it's clearly a business kinda place.  While all the tables were filled , we were 1 of a few 'families' out to dine.  80% were clearly people on business.  I had the filet trio - It was presented quite well.  The veggies were all served on  plates alone and set in the middle , family style dining - we liked that very much.  I was most impressed with the temp. of the food, I am quite particular about my food ( and plate if I can get it) being hot as possible when served.  I suppose all 6 people are brought their plates at the exact same time by a 'team' , it helps ; ) ............. I am always impressed by that performance the few times I've been fortunate enough to receive it. ; )    The toppings of my trio were ALL expertly prepared, shrimp, foie gras, and the reduction.  The actual meat was not my favorite part of the meal.  It was good, chewy ( not tough at all) , but chewy. It was not the aged beef taste I expected from such an expensive restaurant.  BUT - I am far from an expert on red meat as I eat it on rare occasions.  While being a $$$$ place it was quite relaxed atmosphere and  service, you don't feel like you should whisper and keep your napkin folded perfectly in your lap at all times.  great dining experience - would definitely return but only when that 'rich uncle' treats.",

    "text": "Last night I had the best experience I've ever had at ANY restaurant.  The night before I had called around to different places trying to find a restaurant that provided birthday menus to do something special for my boyfriend.  I called Del Frisco's to make a reservation and spoke with Charlie, who was so pleasant on the phone!  I asked about the birthday menu and she let me know that they wouldn't be able to create one but they could give him a birthday card and a complimentary dessert.  She told me to call in the morning to see if they could maybe make an exception.  I asked her if she could put the birthday card on the table before we arrived and she said sure.  The night of our dining experience, I called to push the reservation back half an hour because I was running late and they made the change with no problem.  When I arrived to the restaurant, I was greeted by the two ladies at the front desk, and I asked if one of them were Charlie, the young lady told me Charlie had gone to place the card on our table. **all smiles**  They seat us and a gentleman poured our water and said our server would be out.  We didn't wait long before Kristin came to greet us and take our drink orders.  Our drinks came back in less than 5 minutes which made me immediately feel good about the service we would receive.  Now, it was hardly busy in there on a Tuesday night, but I've been to small, inexpensive chain restaurants that have been dead and waited 10-15 minutes for a server and another 10-20 minutes for my drink.  Kristin came back, helped us decide on what we wanted to order.  She brought the bread out, our appetizer came, and the food shortly after... She checked on us throughout dinner... Everything was great.  We ordered the marinated shrimp appetizer, I had the crab cakes and brussel sprouts, and he had the lamb chops and spinach, our food was delicious!!!!  We were at the table taking a selfie when a server walked by and offered to take our picture which I thought was nice. Kristin came back out with the complimentary dessert and took a few more pictures of us... and when we were leaving Charlie told us goodbye, remembering our names... All in all, I had a great experience from the time I called until the time I left and I would like to thank everyone I came in contact with that evening.  They definitely helped make my boyfriend's birthday special.  Special thanks to Charlie and Kristin!!!",

While being seating at a table that looked like it had just been eaten at with a wrinkled dirty table cloth and candle not lit. I asked we be seated at a table that was clean and set up. The hostess said to stay where we were and she would ask the waiter but it shouldn't be a problem. My wife leaves to use the restroom, upon her return I am still waiting to see someone. No help, no water, no nothing. Finally a gentleman arrives to help, after conversation he leaves to get the hostess back who seated us and she now moves us. Now, after a new table we are waiting nearly another 10 minutes before getting up and walking out without seeing a sole. This isn't the service I was looking for from a del Frisco's.",

As we walked in, I asked the hostess if the tables in the bar area were open for seating and she said absolutely.  So, we sat ourselves and then proceeded to wait for about 10 minutes.  Wait staff and the hostess walked by us multiple times with no attention given whatsoever to our presence.  I was prepared to leave, but my friend said we should move over to the bar itself.  So, we did.  As we tried to make eye contact with either of the 2 bartenders, they waited on patrons on both sides of us with no attention given whatsoever to our presence.  OMG.  After a few long minutes, I said, \"Excuse me,\" as the female bartender walked by.  She glanced back and said, \"I'll be with you in a moment,\" and kept on moving.  The male bartender returned a minute later and asked what we wanted.  We noticed a male patron walk in, sit down at the bar, await service for 5-10 minutes, never received any acknowledgement, and then walked out and left.  We finally received drinks and an appetizer, but the experience was less than stellar.  We won't be back.",

He had an attitude and was not attentive at all our other sever, yes we had 2 servers was much better. She at least checked on us one smiled and was friendly. But service was slow, not very attentive and we were packed in to where we had no privacy. Food was ok not the best we've had. Maybe if we go not during restaurant week it would be better.

When we arrived, there was quite a long line to check in with the hostess. The line went quickly, and the hostess was very friendly and welcoming. We were seated within 5 minutes. The dining room is a mix of regular tables and booths. Our table was a round booth in the corner, very intimate. Our waiter was knowledgeable and professional - top-notch.  Food wise, the meal was fantastic. We decided to order from the Restaurant Week menu. We started with a salad, followed by the filet and mashed potatoes. Our waiter defined the doneness of the meat when I ordered it and ask me to verify the grill work by slicing into the steaks once they were brought to the table. The tender filet was spot-on medium rare...perfection. The mashed potatoes were buttery and melted in my mouth. For dessert I got the chocolate mousse. A satisfying end to the meal. It was creamy and smooth.  I look forward to my next dining experience at Del Frisco's.",

I assumed Del Frisco's would mimic other chain restaurants as far as replicated food and mediocre service with a luxury price tag. Boy was I wrong (minus the price tag)!   A group of about 12 of us came to Del Frisco's for a friend's birthday dinner. We were politely greeted by the hostess and led to our table. There was a personal birthday card on the table from the Del Frisco family. It was a little, but very sweet gesture! I ordered steak (of course), rare. Best steak I've ever had the pleasure of encountering.. Hands down! Who knew this is how steak is supposed to taste?! Sides? The corn, the potatoes and spinach = all amazing! Again, how do you make these simple veggies so devine? The meal only made me wish I could frequent Del Frisco more often. The price tag is definitely worth every penny, but boy is it a luxurious one!

The ambience is great, service abundant and attentive (though the head waiter somewhat mocking the gift we got my mom was overly familiar and unprofessional). But the food is just ok. My steak was very salty, and for that price it really needs to be perfect. The sides were all fine but most of the flavor seemed to derive from an overdose of butter. The whole vibe kind of sweeps you up and envelops you in the swirl. It's fun and intoxicating. It may be that the food being of the utmost highest quality isn't entirely the point.

Our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly. He gave us the run down on the special courses not in the menu. He handed us each our menus individually. He then helped us make an excellent wine selection and informed us of the by the glass deal on Friday nights, wines by the glass were half off! When we ordered our tomahawk steak, my husband and I informed him that we had intentions of sharing and that we liked our steaks medium. He stated that there medium is red and we might consider going medium well. And he was right! Medium well was a perfect pink all the way through and unlike most steakhouses, it was seasoned perfectly. We never once had to ask for anything. The break was amazing and hot also served with hot butter. For sides we ordered Brussel sprouts and lobster Mac and cheese. The Brussels were prepared with bacon and grilled perfectly. The lobster Mac and cheese was rich and the lobster was fresh. Every time I took a sip of my water, someone walked by and refilled it.  From the atmosphere, to the service, to the food, there was nothing lacking.  Lastly we informed the restaurant when making a reservation that we were celebrating an anniversary. Our waiter brought out complimentary dessert. Not just one thing, but a chocolate mousse, butter cake and vanilla ice cream with four plates and four spoons, enough for all of us to share. It was an awesome experience and you will not be disappointed when looking for a nice dinner or to celebrate.",

We went to the hostess stand and we where greeted with hey GUYS. They then showed us our table right on a main walk way. I was shocked as I asked for a quite table. The waiter seemed to rush us thru the entire dinner and we had to wait for senecal items.  We always go to Capital Grill for special events and I decided to try something different. I will go back to a place where they always have treated us special on our holidays.",

And I had to get hot tea because it was SOO COLD, I like cold but had a hard enjoying myself because it was too cold! I almost felt as if they had it that cold so people could hurry up eat and leave due to restaurant week and they was busy ....WELL IT WORKED!!! I did not even eat my dessert there because I was just soooo ready to go and warm up! So bring a jacket with you. The waiter was really nice!",

    "text": "I was in Del Friscos about 3 weeks ago with my date visiting North Carolina. We heard great things about this place so we couldn't wait to enjoy dinner here. It started out a good night the drinks (some pineapple cocktail) was awesome and we ordered apps they were ok. We ordered dinner as a couple came in and sat next to us they were clearly regulars with the attention they were being shown even a manager came over and talked to the couple next to us. We sat there and sat there and finally asked the bartender about our order (we dined at the bar) she said it was up next. After the couple next to us who came in over 30 mins after us was half way through their meal, We asked the waitress 2 more times and she says \"oh they got there food first because you guys wanted your steaks medium well.... \"are you serious? After waiting an hour after appetizers for our food my date asked to speak to the manager. The manager who I guess was briefed comes right over and says oh guys some how the kitchen forgot about you I'll comp you for an appetizer.... APPETIZER after we sat there 2 hours almost. How the hell did the kitchen FORGET our order???   So we sat there watching everyone around us eating for another 15 mins when finally our pricey steaks come out. We both cut into the steaks and BOTH of them were raw on the inside not how we ordered it at all. The bartender looks at me and said \"you look pissed you ok?\" No I'm not ok!  I've never been treated like this at an establishment before. Where everyone just forgets you exists when you're literally in their faces. Not a lot of people happen to look like us when I looked around either so it made me feel like this was done on purpose. We paid the bill and left extremely disappointed. This could have been handled so much better and it might of been with different people who knows. We travel Often and dine in amazing restaurants so this was shocking to me. I will not return.",

We've dined here numerous times & I hosted a birthday party for my husband in the wine cellar downstairs.  The quality of the food is always consistent (if not they'll surely make it up to you).   My husbands fav is the bone in rib-eye. I'm actually not a big steak fan so I always order the crabcakes. They're delicious!    For dessert their banana bread pudding is the best in the city.  We also like to hang out at the bar. For a casual dining experience or something quick check out their bar menu. The portions are generous & very reasonable compared to the main dining room menu. The sliders & fish tacos are really good!",

The steaks were cooked perfectly and the baked potato I had was also probably one of the best I've had in a restaurant.     Their wine list is also very large and overwhelming.  However I would comfortably trust their staff to pick one out for you based on your tastes.  Overall it was a great experience, you really can't go wrong here.",

Before I had never thought of Del Friscos as being better than any other upscale steakhouse, but this time I had pretty much the best filet.  It was perfectly charred and the medium rare, was actually medium rare.  Even the asparagus was perfect, not a single one being mushy.    I was slightly disappointed by the upcharge for the wine.. our bottle of the Frog's Leap cab was $100.. yea exactly.  Thankfully the staff was nice enough to deal with our slightly rowdy and inappropriately dressed table.  They overlooked the fact that I was wearing shorts (I had no idea we were going here.. thus the lack of appropriate dress).  I never thought I'd do this, but 5 stars for the best filet I've had in recent memory.",

Our table shared the ahi tuna, a salad and lobster mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was the BEST I have ever had!  We also shared the filet and crab cakes.  Steak cut like butter and the crab cakes might have been close to the best too which is a strong statement seeing how I live close to MD. Our third party had chicken which I didn't taste and the broccolini (this is what happens when you bring a health nut to a steak house)  but he enjoyed both.  No room for dessert!  I am happy they have a location in Philly!",

The only reason for my 4 stars is due to their Mothers Day brunch .. I don't think they have the brunch thing down too well.. We had to send my fiance's steak back as it was under cooked a little but they left the rest of his food on the table to get cold and he kind of wanted to eat it all together. For dessert I ordered the Bananas Foster French Toast which would have been amazing if it was not cold when they brought it out. I think it had sat in the window a while. The Bloody Mary bar was amazing and the service and staff were great as always .. I had an incredible birthday dinner there with oysters, steak and wines and was very impressed.. Just a little disappointed with the brunch as I expect a little more when I go out to spend some money ... We will be back though (:",

Over the years, we have always enjoyed our dining  experiences- that is until we went to Del Frisco this year. My friend and I always order a rib eye or NY strip. Every so often, we'll have prime rib. Our wives invariably order lobster, etc. This evening, the waitress convicted us to order their special 12oz. Rib eye and crab cake including veggies and dessert. We thought it strange when she told us we could get the promotion for only $99 per couple. We questioned her about the quality of the meat and amount of filler in the crab cakes. She assured our every skepticism, so we agreed to the special. The steak was thin and so over seasoned that my wife, who never complains, called for the waitress. An assistant manager came over and was very apologetic, replaced her steak, and sent over the manager. When we questioned him about the steak quality, he began to explain about butchering. Since we weren't interested in his explanation, he  comped the meal. We thought that was the right thing to do under the circumstances.  When I go to a highly touted Restaurant, the last thing I was is to be comped because the steak is not top quality. It is an admission of their failure to live up to the billing.",

During Restaurant Week we decided to try a new restaurant and I am glad we did Del Frisco's because their steak was delicious. Unfortunately, our waiter was horrible!! My friend ordered some extra bread for the table and the rude waiter came and placed it right in front of her in a rude way without even saying a word and walking away. Why place it right in front of her as if she was going to eat it all. She just ordered it for everyone? Is everyone going to get a loaf of bread chubbed in our face too? Everyone in the table felt offended by his attitude and made it very unconfortable. He never came to check on us and we had to keep asking other waiters to fill up our cups. He was rude and made our dinner experience not enjoyable at all! He made us not want to come back on a regular day to pay regular price and get BAD SERVICE!!!",

For 49.95 per person, you get a full size Del's salad (huge portion, house made dressing and bacon), an 8 oz filet with crab cake, a choice of side, and a full size dessert. ( cheesecake, chocolate mousse or bread pudding). There is absolutely no way you can find better value at a restaurant in Charlotte...the food quality is exceptional and the portions are significant...seriously, two people could share one meal and be full. For those curious about this restaurant, but apprehensive about the price, go try this special....best deal in town by far. I will definitely be back!",

The lower bar area can get a little crowded and can be a wonderful place to mingle but if your looking for a little more room the upsatirs bar is the place to go.  Dinner can be quite expensive but also well worth it. Great selection of steaks and sides. They also have nightly specials that have never let us down.   By far the best deal at Del Frisco's is the bar menu where everything is $7 from 4:30pm-7:00pm. I suggest the burger and popcorn shrimp with a couple drinks and you can walk out for about $30 after a great time.",

The decor is perfect and beautiful, food is excellent and Rick (manager) goes out of his way to make it a great experience. The service Is top notch and they have a wine deal on Fridays that is hard to beat. I have been meaning to write one up for them for a while, but better late than never. I never regret money spent here and be sure to get the lemon cake to take with you. It makes getting up early the next day quite worth it!",

The best Ceasar salad I've ever had. The cheesecake is so light fluffy.  I suggest eating on the first floor or up top. On Valentine's Day, we tried the bottom floor seating, I guess you would call it the Wine Cellar area. It was crowded and noisy. You get a more romantic feel if you go upstairs. The scenery is especially nice with the large windows.",

Also, the lobster mac & cheese was delicious. The sides are family style so they can feed up to 2 to 3 people. It's definitely pricey but when you try the food it'll be worth it.

The decor and layout definitely beats the one in Boston.  No need to get into the menu as it's pretty standard and alike the other locations.  However, I do highly recommend you have the Thick Cut Bacon Au Poivre.  Holy cow, this is one of the best bacon dishes I have ever had in my life, no joke.  Service here is phenomenal, us usual.  All the stars were aligned.  Just one tiny thing bothered me and made me take away one star: it was my father's birthday celebration dinner.  They were really kind and gave my Dad a greeting card signed by a number of staff.  However, they did not sing him happy birthday or offer any birthday desert.  We saw another table that night get sung happy birthday to and offered a small desert.  I found this very bizarre, and I was somewhat disappointed, because Del Frisco's usually doesn't make slip ups like that.  Oh well.  So if you are there for a birthday, make sure you remind them to do what should be done for a birthday :-)",

There was a couple of woman who were so scantily dressed it was embarrassing. All they did was take selfies of themselves with flashes all during dinner. The management should have asked them to stop. If your going to charge prices you charge you should be more responsible and considerate to your patrons.",

John Miller over books the restaurant so you will not get your reservation time, the hostess station area at the front of the restaurant will be slammed and the food quality will suffer as a result of too many people. We dined on Saturday evening (1/20) and the restaurant was way too busy to enjoy your meal. We had to wait 30-45 minutes after our reservation time to be seated. The bar was slammed and the waiting are is non-existent so we waited among a crowd of people at the front. We ordered off the regular menu and were disappointed in our meals. The kitchen is simply to busy. I have eaten here over 10 times and it is completely different restaurant on a normal Saturday. Again if you want a nice steak dinner avoid during Queen's Feast.",

I ask for it in an old fashioned glass because let's face it, it's a girly drink everyone can enjoy...just not in a martini glass. The appetizers and salads are solid, I'm a blue cheese wedge fan.   While the other protein in this place is ok (fish, chicken, seafood...) you are here for the steaks... and they are good. Every time I've come here they have been well prepared! The stakes are a little on the expensive side, but not astronomical.   What you save on the steaks they will take on the wine. They have a very impressive wine list, with a very impressive price tag. Finding something decent less than $80 takes a little bit of effort. The sides are not to be forgotten. I particularly like the lobster mac&cheese, mushrooms and spinach. The service in this place of above average, good wait staff.   Overall, solid choice any day of the week... or everyday of the week depending on your budget.",

    "text": "We went to Del Frisco's for 2 reasons. 1. Queens Feast (their menu selection). 2. Our daughter's birthday.   Due to the promotion I couldn't place a favorable reservation for over a week. Upon arrival I still had to wait an additional 15 mins past my reservation time to be seated. I found this very annoying.   We already knew what we wanted to sample from the menu (which is why we chose DF); however, it took extra long for the each course of the meal to be brought to the table. I also noticed that all the surrounding tables were on the same time frame as us (think of cruise ship dining).   We were highly disappointed with our meal. None of our steaks were cooked appropriately. From the long wait we didn't want to send them back.  The food runner did suggest that since our plates were 500 degrees that if we cut our steaks and place them face down on the plate they will continue to cook to our desired temperature.   Needless to say, after finishing this meal, I came to the conclusion that - I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this meal. It was on par to Outback IMO. Second, I'm glad my parents decided not to join us for their first experience to DF.  Third, my last meal there was my best and DF made MY b day special and since they didn't even acknowledge my daughters b day though mentioned in the reservation, I doubt highly I will be going back in the near future.   Lastly, I feel that Queens Feast is a time for local Charlotte restaurants to shine. Not feed the herd like cruise ships. Also, they should make the same impression as they would on during a full price meal so that the patron will come back and spend the money for your meal and price point.  Every experience should count.",

We've recently been sampling high end steak houses in the Charlotte area and Del Frisco's disappointed. Service was extremely slow, waiter was inattentive and uninformed.  My mom asked the waiter if they had a peppercorn sauce for her steak, in which he immediately replied \"yes\" and that it would \"come on the steak\", which I thought was weird since the menu said it would have a \"red wine demi-glace. I figured he knew what he was talking about. Once we received our food, there was no peppercorn sauce. The steaks were way too salty and chewy, making it hard to eat. My mom also had multiple pieces of gristle in her medallions, which she had to spit out. We tried to eat what we could of our meals. When the waiter finally came by to check on how are meals were, my dad complained about the amount of salt and we showed him all the gristle. The response was that \"we do use lots of salt in our restaurant and should expect gristle in a filet medallion\". He also said \"we should have told him sooner and  he would've brought a new steak\". The problem was this was the first time he checked on us the entire meal. After complaining, never did a manager or kitchen staff come by. Stick to the sister company, Sullivan's in South End. Their service and food are great. Del Frisco's was a big disappointment.",

My favorite beer was on tap so that was definitely a plus (Wicked Weed - Pernicious). Our service was great, it was the main course that I was not impressed with. I had the Caesar salad (excellent!) Filet Oscar style with mashed potatoes. I personally, do not like RED steaks. Some people believe that anything more than medium ruins a steak, but there are those of us who prefer a steak to be cooked more. At a restaurant like this, I should be able to get my steak however I offer it. With that being said I was previously warned that the steaks are undercooked so I ordered mine medium well, hoping to get medium. What I received was medium rare, so my first steak was sent back. Second one that came was cooked a little more so I kept it. It was still not med-well like I ordered but luckily it was so dark in there I couldn't see if there was red leaking on my plate. Potatoes were very peppery. For someone who doesn't love pepper, they were just okay. Not as great as I was expecting. Desert, I had the bread pudding and it was fantastic! Only downfall here was the main course, and to me that is the most important. I probably won't return, there are other places I can get a steak of the same quality and have cooked the way I order.",

I had noted it was our anniversary when I made the reservation. We had an excellent table and when we were seated, an anniversary card signed by the staff was on the table!  Our server, Thomas, was wonderful.  He was attentive but not interruptive. He was happy to answer any questions or make suggestions.  He guided me to a good value delicious Cabernet.  The food was fantastic. The crab cake was delicious - not so much a cake as a lot of top quality crab meat mixed with some vegetables and sauce, mounded together.  The sauce for the crab cake was amazing.  Lobster bisque was rich with large chunks of lobster. Loved it.  We ordered two steaks - the prime ribeye and he bone in ribeye. Top notch. They are salted and seasoned, if you are sensitive to the taste of salt it might be a bit much. They will not salt it at your request it. Regardless, they were cooked to perfection and delicious. The truffle butter crab topping put the bone in ribeye over the top.  We had a couple sides - potatoes at gratin which were fine (a slight smoky flavor due to the bacon) and lobster mac & cheese, which was a bit sweeter than expected but still quite good.  Lastly, they surprised us with a complimentary cheesecake dessert. Heaven on a plate, with strawberry sauce.  All in all, a wonderful experience. The cost can get up there quite quickly, but definitely an excellent special occasion choice.",

It is very noisy here I might add.  Once seated we were given the menu and drink specials. Only 2 of us ordered alcohol from the drink menu which were very good although they took quite a while to come out maybe 20 minutes and we sat across from the bar... The appetizers we ordered about 4 items took almost an hour to arrive so we filled up on bread. The main courses took almost as long and were not even hot when they arrived and still we tried not to complain. Even as a table across from us got their food before us and arrived after us.. Started to feel a little personal at that point.. My food was tasty. I had fish, and the other 3 people in my party had steaks and they were very dry and overly cooked. The manager did come over and apologize and comped us for our appetizers and dessert. I appreciated that. This is the reason for the 3rd star. (I almost wanted to give it 3 1/2) I liked food choice I made  but I don't know if I will return. For these prices the service and wait staff needs some improvement.",

When I arrived I approached the hostess desk. My husband told me to tell them to point me in the direction of where he was seated. All he could tell me was that he was downstairs. I told the hostess that we had reservations and I need to know how to get downstairs. The hostess said okay we will have someone to take you there. I waited and waited. Even tried calling my husband for him to come and get me because I was still waiting. Cellphone service was not good downstairs. Needless to say, I waited until the hostess says oh can you take her to the cellar. So my rating is based on the initial customer service. Everything else was beautiful. We will return!",

Our waitress was very pleasant and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. Since we were not truly hungry (hence the impromptu), we opted to order just desserts. Our waitress spoke highly of everything but we opted to try the butter cake and cheesecake! Holy coy, I kid you not, these had to be the best desserts I tasted it years. My husband had the the butter cake, which was topped with butter pecan ice cream and was simply Devine! I had the cheesecake which tasted like Heaven on a Plate!!!! I mean it just melted in my mouth. The dessert wine she recommended was delicious as well. Overall, I'd give our desserts a 10/10!!!!",

My guest's steak was served nearly raw, and after being refired, it was returned the same way. Asparagus also undercooked. No trace of lobster in the lobster mac and cheese. Mashed potatoes had the consistency of paste. I was given the weekly wine list at the bar. They were out of my selection. During dinner they informed me that the bottle I selected was the last of their stock and that I'd need to select another if we wanted a 2nd bottle. I selected another bottle and was soon thereafter told that they were out of stock of that as well.",

This place was recommended and highly spoken of so I finally ventured to the place. There are two free parking lots and they have valet in front. I made a reservation and they would not seat my party until everyone was there. We were seated soon after everyone was there. The waiter was knowledgeable. I had the VIP martini which I couldn't taste the vodka. It goes down smooth. I was told it was infused with pineapples for 14 days. It tasted like pineapple juice. It creeps up on you. I had the lobster bisque for appetizer and it was yummy now the best lobster bisque I have ever had, but hit the spot. The 8 ounce steak and potatoes were delicious. I absolutely loved the cheesecake. It was light and fluffy it was some really good cheesecake. I had another martini the pomegranate martini. It was strong and you can taste the alcohol with a bit after bite to it. I feel the customer service was the best I have had in a long time and really value and appreciate that. It wasn't fake, but genuine. I will definitely return and recommend.",

    "text": "I have been told about Del Frisco's from someone who visits there just about every week, so I thought this would be a great place to have my Dad's 65th Birthday Dinner. I was wrong and I definitely should've went elsewhere. On Friday, 6/29, my family and I visited Del Frisco's for dinner, to start off, I noticed that majority of the melanated races were asked to sit upstairs, while very few were able to sit downstairs. That caught my attention immediately. Once we were seated we were greeted by an amazing waitress, Kim. Kim was the best part of my experience and I truly appreciate her for everything she did that evening. My unpleasant feeling towards the restaurant and the staff came in when we started to receive our food. I noticed that customers who sat down after us had quick and hot food, while our food was continuously cold. To start, the appetizer, we ordered the Calamari, while the flavor was amazing, it was cold. I let Kim know it was cold and that we ate it because we had already split it up and were hungry, however, we just wanted her to know for the next time it was ordered. She came to let us know that the manager removed the Calamari from our meal, I advised her,  thank you but not necessary. I immediately did not want the waitress or staff to feel like, we purposely ate it and complained to get a free app, it was simply an for your information. However, we were appreciative that they did take it off. The issue was that Kim's manager asked her \"Did she not check on us after she brought it out\", which implies to me from my previous restaurant experience, why did they not tell you that before they ate it. I advised Kim, I did not see her after the food was dropped off but she was very busy and that's okay. Secondly, we did not receive any bread as other tables immediately recieved bread upon sitting and our salads took forever to come to our table. The drinks were not worth it and very watered down and It only goes downhill from there. My family and I noticed that a particular manager would go to every single table around us to check on them, but he never stopped by our table to ask. We watched him walk towards us on multiple occasions and once complete, turn around and walk back to where he met his counterpart. This was completely unprofessional and very disturbing in a restaurant that you are spending close to $400 on a meal. Not only was he rude, our actual food for dinner was also cold. The plates were hot as though they were sitting on a warmer, but the food was cold and unpleasant. The spinach and lobster mac was cold, so this time, we sent this back. We received another plate of both, and they were both a little warmer than the last, but not hot as though we continuously received sitting plates. This infuriated me and I was completely against coming back to the restaurant. To have your food cold 3 times and you are spending the amount of money to eat at a restaurant of that caliber, I would expect a little more courtesy from management. I will not go back to this restaurant and I encourage this restaurant to engage in anti-discrimination classes on how to treat their guests and understand that melanated skin doesn't mean you have to all sit upstairs, this is 2019, not the 40s-50s. I was very disappointed as I had hoped to have an amazing experience there that would become a regular visit for me, but with the experience I received I wouldn't even recommend anyone I know of caliber to eat there. The only reason for a 2 star is because Kim was the best part of the visit.",

I've been wanting to compare Capital Grille to this establishment for a while, in case anyone was wondering which was 'better'. I preferred CG's calamari with the peppers, but both of them are delicious. DF's calamari is fried and comes sans marinara sauce, but there is some sauce on the coating. It was fried slightly crunchier than I prefer, but my date and I ate every piece- actions speak louder than (written) words.  The Chilean Sea Bass and crab cake entree was delicious. At Capital Grille I had crab and shrimp cakes. While that was also good, it paled in comparison to the half of crab cake I ate here (my friend and I split since she couldn't finish it all). This is the bar by which all crab cakes should be judged. Seriously, I think back to some I've had in the past and feel ashamed that I enjoyed them that much.  The lobster bisque......deliciously smooth with chunks of lobster. It can't get much better there. I can't wait to return.",

The butter cake for dessert was so delicious, I'll probably stop in just for that if I'm anywhere near the vicinity. I would definitely return. The restaurant would be great if you are trying to impress anyone, the ambience is perfect for a date night, girl's night, or even a business meeting. I would choose dressy/business casual attire, due to the upscale nature of the establishment, complimentary valet is available, and although there are no rules regarding the kiddos, I'd leave them at home with the sitter and enjoy a grown up night!",

    "text": "Tonight was my first time dining at any Del Frisco's location.  I have been looking forward to trying it and thought I'd give it a whirl during restaurant week so I made reservations.  They have valet available curbside.  We arrived at 6:45 for our 7 pm reservation for three people. We were seated at 7:05.  Unfortunately, they seated us at a table upstairs which did not work for us as one of the diners in our group cannot walk long distances or climb stairs due to health reasons.  This isn't the restaurants fault and I didn't know there were two floors or I would have asked for a table downstairs upon making the reservation.  They have an elevator but unfortunately, in order to get to the elevator you have to walk all the way through the restaurant.  Wasn't a big deal for me personally but was for one member in our party and could be for others in the future if you aren't aware.  We dined during Restaurant Week and ordered from the special menu. I ordered the seasonal salad, 8 oz filet Oscar style with potatoes, and cheesecake.  They brought complimentary bread after we waited for service at the table for 15 minutes.  It was a loaf of white bread covered in sesame seeds. Basically a glorified sesame seed bagel.  It was a Monday night and they were busy because of restaurant week but the service was ridiculously slow. It should not have taken 2.5 hours for three people to eat.  It was a 30 minute wait from the time we ordered to receive our soup/salad.  The salad was very dry.  The lobster bisque was extremely salty.  I've had better off the hot bar at Harris teeter down the street for a lot less.  It had exactly two small pieces of lobster in it. It was another long wait for our entrees to arrive.  The chateau potatoes were delicious and the steak was cooked perfectly.  I ordered mine Oscar style like I have many other times at other dining establishments.  I think it ruined the steak at Del Frisco's.  You couldn't taste any crab and the asparagus was extremely undercooked.  All I could taste for the remainder of the meal was the undercooked asparagus unfortunately.  Hours later and I can still taste it.  Waited another 20 minutes for our deserts even though we ordered them at the beginning of the meal.  Don't get me wrong, the cheesecake was delicious but it didn't taste like any cheesecake I had ever had before.  It was light and airy.  I really enjoyed it.   I've heard such amazing things about this chain and how I have to check it out.  All three of us were very disappointed in the experience.  The food was we subpar, the service was slow, it was extremely loud and crowded.  I have read that they have good happy hour specials so I might give them another chance and try those out one night.  It's nothing special and especially once you take into account how expensive the meal is.",

The service was wonderful and their selection for drinks are over 1200 choices. I didn't have anything to drink but enjoyed the atmosphere and mood the place set from the moment you walk into the door.   Service was awesome and very friendly. Even though It is restaurant week the quality is just as good as none restaurant week. I got the 8 oz filet med rare and it was cooked perfect!!! It was so full of flavor in every bite!   I honestly don't see or believe that people rated this less than five stars!   The cheesecake was really good for dessert!",

It is my favorite item on the menu but the lobster mac and cheese is a close second.    To be perfectly honest the steak was very good but not amazing as it didn't seem to be seasoned at all.  Almost like they forgot, but the temperature was perfect. I ordered my steak medium.    All the seafood on the menu is very delicious.  I do plan to try the steak again at some point to see if they were just having an off day.  Everything else has been so good there, I think it may have just been a one off experience.  I have to give them 4/5 stars because they are a steakhouse and the steak was the one thing that I wasn't in love with.",

I also tried my fiancee's crab cakes and I have to say they were the best crab cakes I have ever had.  True \"JUMBO LUMP crab cakes\".  The service was good, but a little slow, and maybe not to the level of professionalism you would expect.  If you want to way overpay for a fantastic bottle of wine and get the whole 5 star sommelier experience; that option is available.  The brussel sprouts had a unique smoky flavor I have not tasted before and were cooked perfectly.   I highly recommend he Butter Cake dessert--it tastes so much better than just a buttery pound cake--it's probably not on the Keto diet though.",

    "text": "We dined at Del Frisco's in NYC earlier this year, and enjoyed our meal enough to dine with them again in Charlotte. Let me set the scene for you. A sudden thunderstorm popped up, making our journey to the restaurant difficult- then upon arriving and seeing there was no awning, we waited in the car as the storm raged around us, hoping it would let up. Then the Maitre'D comes out, with an umbrella to escort us in. He got completely soaked. The valet must have been held up by the rain, and noticing this, he stepped in to help. That is above and beyond. It would not be the last of the great service we had at Del Frisco's.   Food  Appetizers- We had the calamari and the shrimp cocktail. The calamari were VERY spicy. No one had a problem with it, and it was certainly different that what we normally get elsewhere. The shrimp cocktail were indeed JUMBO, and everyone was happy with them.   Entrees- We had 3 bone in filets- this is one of the best cuts of steak on the planet. If you dine in a steakhouse that offers one of these, you should get it. We also had a regular filet, and a filet trio. The filet was very good. My Dad was not however totally sold on his trio once it arrived and he got started on it. It included filet Oscar, a filet with a mushroom topping, and one other, that I cannot remember. His favorite was the filet Oscar- I'm not sure that he liked the flavor of the topping on the other two.  All of the steaks were cooked perfectly.   Sides- We had the Mac and Cheese, sweet potatoes, asparagus and creamed corn. The mac and cheese was the STAR side in NYC when we dined there. So we were expecting the same greatness. Nope. The Charlotte mac and cheese had jalapenos in it!! We were shocked. I have terrible heartburn and cannot eat spicy food- but our incredible waiter discovered this, and brought us another mac and cheese sans the peppers. Even then, it still wasn't quite as good as we remembered. The sweet potatoes were fine, and bit runny actually, and not quite sweet enough. The asparagus was good, and everyone enjoyed the creamed corn. I am sorry to say I cannot make a GREAT side recommendation for this Del Frisco's.   Dessert- Incredible. They had some really fantastic items. I had the Lemon doberge cake- which was HUGE, and AMAZING. The cake was moist, the filling was the perfect balance of sweet and tart, and the frosting/glaze was delicious. We also had the cheesecake- which was very good, and much lighter in texture than your average cheesecake. It was whipped. I thought it was a great take on the dessert. We also had the chocolate lava cake, the chocolate mousse, and the mango sorbet. Both of the chocolate desserts were very good. We were a little disappointed that all the restaurant had left was the mango sorbet, as the other flavors were something we had really enjoyed in NYC. I would certainly advise that you save room for dessert.   Service- I already mentioned the Maitre 'D. The waiter or waitress you have can really make or break an experience in a restaurant. We had a great dinner, and it was only enhanced by our INCREDIBLE waiter, John. He was very knowledgeable about the menu, and wine list. He was friendly, witty and funny. Should you choose to dine here, you would be so lucky to have him as your server.   Overall the service was a 5 star experience. I am going with 4 stars since we were a little disappointed in a few of the items we ordered. We would go here again if we were in the area.",

    "text": "In a town where steakhouses have traditionally ruled, this SouthPark staple is king. A sweeping staircase, dramatically dim lighting, and an excess of mahogany make this gorgeous steakhouse the most elegant in town. And while its grandeur may evoke nostalgia for the city's boom days of dining, Del Frisco's retains its status as a place to spot the city's most powerful with steak knives in hand.  What to get: The filet, rib eye, prime strip, or porterhouse. This menu is a beef lover's dream, and beautifully marbled slabs of meat are perfectly cooked and simply served.  Don't skip: The first course. The fried calamari comes in a slightly spicy Asian glaze and the steak tartare is served in a cool mound alongside slivers of crisp potato chips.  Best bargain: On Sunday nights Del Frisco's offers its Restaurant Week menu--and therefore the chance to sample without breaking the bank--with three courses for just $30.",

This place also have a dictionary book 9f wine and champagne list.  Price per bottle minimum is 60 but it is embarrassing to ask for that one,  so it's safe to spend a 100  dollar bottle of wine.

If you have never seen the Wine Cellar on the lower level of Del Frisco's ...let me tell you ....it is an absolutely gorgeous setting.  We preset a menu, from which guests could choose their meals. They were all pleased with their food, including lemon cake for dessert.  What really set the night apart was the staff. Natalie the event planner was great with offering suggestions that fit our style and budget...never trying to push one item over another.  Bobby the service lead for our event expertly guided the staff throughout the night. The whole service team was friendly, engaging and responsive to our guests' needs and requests.

    "text": "Am a little late on this update as it's about our Fathers Day Brunch experience and that was a few weeks ago but, still felt compelled to type.  Went to brunch with my wife, her sister, and their parents.  The brunch menu was pretty extensive and covered an App, Entree and Dessert for $35.    First good news.  Not being a dessert person, I asked if I could sub two apps instead of one app and one dessert.  \"It's fathers day sir, absolutely no problem\".    Second good news.  Just the quality of the food.  From the giant, delicious bacon slabs that adorn that house salad with the sinfully good Green Goddess dressing (Quick Tip... go at night, order the house chips, a side of the GG dressing, a side of the Blue Cheese dressing and go to town. O-M-G), to the steak which my father in law decreed, \"the best steak I've had in 10 years\", to the Shrimp Scampi.  Yes, I ordered Shrimp Scampi at a steak joint.  Why?  Cause I love it and its hard to find done well around here and I knew it would be great here.  And...... It was.  SHOCK!!!  Third good news.  The service.  Extensive knowledge of the menu, the aforementioned flexibility on the brunch items, the way they team up at just the right moment, swoop in and clear everything away.  One really feels well taken care of here.  Final good news?  The check.  At $35 per for all that food, I've never gotten out of Del Frisco's that cheap before. OK, they aren't perfect...  They need to go fresh squeezed on the Mimosa OJ.  131 Main does it, I know they can too.  But, Tropicana in my drink pales in comparison to all that is wonderful here.  We'll be back...",

Ok, it is a chain but a very expensive chain. Sorry to sound uppity, but I expect nothing but long term, tenured wait staff. You know these folks, they make top dollar and are True pros. We had good service, but does not compare to what we had in Greensboro at Flemings.  Direction: 1 Star. I reserve a week in advance as I mostly have groups. In this case 18 people. Requested a private room, ended up with a \"Sorry, but upstairs is now booked (Thanks for Calling!) but we will sit you in the crowded corner. So much for the private business dinner meeting.   Food: What is happening? Down to 2 stars. Had 8 dishes sent back. Mine was really a disappointment. How to begin, ok the beginning. We ordered starters, which one item was crab cakes. Ok, that was fine but I do not eat red meat. I like it, it don't like me. So for my main course I ordered the crab cake dinner. Yes, three time the price of the starter! Expect something dinnerish? Yes. What was delivered? Two crab starter cakes with a blob of slaw in the middle. Hyper inflation anyone?  Overall: We are down to 3 Stars folks. Must be why the restaurant was only about 50% full and even had open bar stools at prime time.   Del! Oh Del! Your lemon cake is still the bomb!!! Please work so the rest of the menu don't turn into a bomb :-( Frankly, I have had better at Chic-Fil-A at a whole lot less.   BTW, 4 of my customers stated the same and being Charlotte residents the comment was made \"Nevermind taking me back here, save your money\"  I will return Del, but your on probation.

We went there last night (it's been at least a year since a mediocre experience there) and that was the best dining experience I've had in a looooong time.   The service was insane - the sommelier came over to explain the wines twice, the waiter was constantly checking in (not obnoxiously) and had in depth explanations of the menu as well as items that we could get that weren't on the menu.  When we were finished, about 5 people swooped in and cleaned up our table in less than 5 seconds.    To drink we had the VIP martini (pineapple infused vodka) which was frothy and VERY tasty (and strong).  I ordered the shrimp cocktail, which you can get with a bunch of different sauces but I got the traditional cocktail sauce and asked them to make it extra spicy and it was great. Got the scallops which were succulent and there were plenty of them with the perfect amount of a delicious sauce; we ordered the 3 fillet medallions and the petite fillet, baked potato, and mac and cheese (we brought the kids) and they were deeeelicious.  They were very accomodating in terms of providing the kids with a \"vanilla\"/not to spicey version of the sides.  And we ended with one of those molten chocolate cakes with vanilla bean ice cream which we ordered for the kids, but I ate almost the whole thing.  And I don't even like chocolate that much.  They knew it was my birthday, so maybe that's why the service was exceptional, but I doubt it.  Looking forward to going back after a long break from this place!",

If you can time it right to get there for the appetizers and wine, you can go crazy and not spend much at all. They had one of the best burgers in Charlotte on the menu, but sometime this year they did change the bar menu and altered the burger and it mad me sad. Now its a double burger and they changed the quality of the meat. I will still go because the service is outstanding and the ambiance and wine are great, but come on Del Frisco's! Bring back my burger.",

Got great recommendations from our excellent server and was very pleased with my meal (Filet with mushroom sauce).  The desserts were ah-mazing - both the Bread Pudding & the Cheesecake.

    "text": "I've been here about a half dozen times. And been to the one on NYC. They're both very similar in that the interiors are so lavish and huge that they have no choice but to charge the highest prices in the area for anything (everything) on their menu.   And that would be fine if everything on the menu was of the best quality and flavor.  Unfortunately my experience has shown me that is not the case.   For some reason, they just can't serve a good ribeye. I've sent back about half the rib eyes I've ordered here. Either not cooked to right temperature, overly tough and fatty, or someone didn't hear me say Pittsburgh style. Or maybe it's so loud in there I just wasn't speaking loud enough.   Have enjoyed better steaks at Beef n Bottle, Capital Grille, The Palm and even Ruth's Chris.   If spending too much on average food doesn't bother you than this is is great place to visit for the healthy bar scene, people watching and great service.   Yes. The service is great. Personal. Real. Friendly. And the people working here look like they're having fun. And I may have a crush on Sandy the bartender.  But honestly, I'm happy they all love their jobs. And that many people are probably so hammered they don't realize they're eating average food.   I'll be back. Largely to flirt with Sandy. But I may just settle for a few drinks at the bar and take an uber across the street for a steak at Ruth's Chris after.",

    "text": "When you go to an upscale place like this and pay the prices they demand you have high expectations. Our group of four had dinner on Christmas Eve. The wine selection, ambiance, Brussels sprouts, bread, and water were excellent. I had the medallions and they were good. My wife, daughter and son-in-law all had fillets. We went through the somewhat silly ordeal with the server, cutting our meat at his insistence to determine if it was cooked properly. Well, this is fine if they are going to do something about it if not cooked as ordered. My daughter ordered medium well and it was served red in the middle. Due to medical reasons, she cannot eat RED meat. She explained this to the server and he took it back for another try. In the mean time, everyone else is eating while their food is warm. Eventually her steak returns and low and behold it's still not right. Half of it was better but the other half still red. She showed the server again and his response was that medium well was pink in the middle, blah, blah, blah. Well his flashlight (obviously a necessary tool to show customers how smart they are) revealed it was RED! He offered to have it recooked again but of course by that time everyone else was almost done eating. My daughter said no, she would just eat what she could. Then, to add insult to injury he offered to give her something she could take the red meat home in. The worst part about the whole ordeal was the waiter actually insisted the customer was wrong in front of everyone else that could see my daughter was correct. I have been in restaurants that have had issues before and they most always attempt to make sure the customers leaves happy, one way or another. We all just left disappointed with the service and paid way too much for food that couldn't be eaten. Kind of put a damper on our Christmas Eve family dinner experience. Not likely to return. I am amazed at some of the reviews for this place.",

By 7pm, however, it was packed.    $99 power couple meal is an absolute steal when the food and service are this good:  one salad per person, steak and crabcake per person, one side dish per person but large enough to share across 4 people, and one dessert per person for $99.  The steak literally melted in my mouth.  We added stone crab claws as an appetizer, but that was a mistake.  They're ridiculously delicious but really expensive and you get so much food with the Power Couple meal, it just wasn't a wise decision.    Highly recommend this place for a swanky once in a while dinner location.  I",

No matter, it was worth the trip and every penny.  I really wanted stone crab claws but the waiter told us they were out do to a shortage. We shared an ahi tuna salad with the tuna cooked just perfectly rare, and the most amazing lobster macaroni and cheese I have ever tasted.  My friend and I shared an 8 oz  filet and crab cakes with Jicama Slaw & Cajun Lobster Sauce. Our 3rd friend ordered chicken and broccolini because he only eats healthy, unlike Nicole B and me! The filet literally melted in our mouths, and the crab cake was all crab and no filler. I had a $15 A Breath of Fresh Pear, Grey Goose La Poire Vodka, Cointreau, white cranberry juice which was pricey but very good. This meal ruined several others because nothing could compare to the deliciousness we experienced at Del Frisco's!",

The setting was also wonderful, with high ceilings and tables spaced comfortably apart for privacy. A little on the pricey side, but no more expensive than any other top-ranked steakhouse chain I've been to. Their Friday Night wine special knocked a $95 bottle of Cab down to around $60 -- a great value. All in all, Del Frisco's made for an outstanding meal and a very special birthday celebration.

The menu is quite pricey, but this restaurant is upscale along the lines of Morton's or Ruth's Chris. Dress nicely when you show up here.  The service was attentive, professional and polite. It's exactly as great as you'd expect for a high end restaurant. The food was also a highlight. The appetizers we ordered were delicious. The fried calamari looked and smelled so delicious that I broke my \"I'll never eat *squid*\" rule and tried it. It tasted fantastic.   Shockingly, I discovered at 40 that apparently I am incredibly allergic to calamari, as I went into mild anaphylaxis (it was my first exposure ever to calamari or any mollusc). Nevermind that, it was delicious! However, I've been informed that I am to never eat calamari or any other mollusc again. So sad. I'll say this, fried calamari was never tempting enough to even try until I it was in front of me at Del Frisco's, so there's that.  All in all, a wonderful dining experience. Just a little pricey for my wallet at the moment. Highly recommended!",

The decor is absolutely striking!  The bar is well stocked and the service is impeccable.  I ordered the grapefruit habanero margarita...strong and sweet at first, but then the flavor of the habanero comes in with a pleasant, yet not overpowering spice.  My dinner guest and I ordered different first courses: I requested the classic Caesar salad and she ordered the lobster bisque.  Thankfully, I was able to sample the lobster bisque and it was phenomenal.  The creaminess of the soup and flavor was exquisite.  We both ordered the filet with the mashed potatoes.  The steak was cooked to perfection.  I noticed the crispness of the sear and the seasoning made this filet absolutely wonderful!  Cutting into this filet was a soft pink center...just the way I like it.  The rest period allowed the steak to be juicy and tasty.   Our final course was dessert.  I selected chocolate mousse and my friend ordered the cheesecake.  The chocolate mousse won me over, because there was a salted caramel sauce spooned over top.  Chocolate + caramel = a very happy me!  The cheesecake was no-bake, so it was very light and fluffy.  Not too sweet and not as dense as you would find in a baked cheesecake.  On a side note, I have disdain for people that order steaks well-done and/or have the audacity to ask for steak sauce!  You will only receive the best quality piece of meat at this restaurant.  They are the experts at cooking, why would you be steered wrong?  The lady at the next table ordered her filet well done.  The waiter suggested that it wouldn't be a good decision, but alas, the customer is always right.  When her steak was brought out, she complained that it was tough!  Really, lady??? They tried to tell you!",

    "text": "So, you know me, I'm pretty particular about experiences.  We stopped into Del Frisco's on the second Saturday night of Restaurant Week.  Some restaurants really struggle with service during Restaurant Week and that's ok, I can actually understand that because they're slammed for 10 days straight.  Del Frisco's, however, not only didn't struggle, they did a really impressive job for such a busy night.  We stopped in about 60 minutes early in hopes of getting bar seats and having a drink.  Check in at the hostess stand was easy and I was told we'd get a text closer to our reservation time.  We went to the bar to find a couple available seats peppered here and there.  Some nice guy at the bar changed his seat so at least the girls could sit down together.  I was pleasantly pleased.    We ordered a Pomegranate Martini, $15 (360 vodka, pomegranate liquor and splash of cranberry) and The V.I.P. $14 (Svedka clementine vodka infused with Hawaiian pineapple.)  Glasses are large, the VIP tasted of pineapple only, the martini had some bite though.  The bartenders didn't really engage with us but we were a group of 4, we were happy talking to each other.  The couple next to us got up to leave and offered the men their seats as well.  A couple my parents age got up when their table was called and patted an arm of one of our group and told us young folk to have a good dinner.  Gotta say, the clientele here is great.  (She called us \"young folk\"!!)  We were texted 10 minutes before our reservation and walked to a very desirable banquette table on the lower floor overlooking the floor to ceiling windows.  The hostess pulled the table out for us to get in the back and offered to come back later for pictures if we wanted, after we'd commented on how much we liked our table.  The floor under the table needed a good sweeping, but it was a busy Saturday, no biggie.  Water was quickly filled and we had a few minutes to look at the menu before we were approached by our front waiter Khaleel.  Personality plus, he confidently walked us through the menu and offered time for questions or explanations of the menu, refills on the drinks (recognizing at a glance what each of us were drinking).  He mentioned his back waiter was Courtney and that they'd be serving us as a pair.  Piping hot sesame bread arrived from another person (oddly uncut, guests had to either rip or cut their bread with their table knives) with some whipped butter.  It was mentioned online that all the sauces, salad dressings and breads are house-made every day.  We all opted for the $35 Restaurant Week menus (how could you not?  The filet alone was $42.95 on the regular menu!) with the men opting for the $15 upcharge to get Prime Ribeye. Our starters were the deconstructed Caesar salad or the spring salad.  Both were nice small salads with homemade dressings.  The Caesar dressing had a snappy anchovy taste and I LOVE that.  Don't be afraid of anchovies in Caesar dressing, it's the secret behind it's delicious taste. I tasted my husbands Spring Mix salad and his Balsamic Vinaigrette was delicious, too.  Our entrees arrived and the server invited the three steak eaters to cut into their steaks to check temperatures.  All three (2 Prime Ribeyes, 1 filet) had been ordered med-rare.  One ribeye and one filet went back to the kitchen because they were still rather cold and blue inside.  The server (I guess his job was to serve entrees) was surprised and not happy, not unhappy with us, but unhappy the guests weren't happy.  He took them back and we had them back on our table in about 5 minutes.  The manager and Khaleel both had been told that two steaks went back and both came over to our table to check on them.  I like the service here. !!    I had ordered crabcakes and I'm iffy about them.  I guess I'd have to say the freshly handcut veggies sprinkled within them were a little too large and ended up overpowering the taste of the delicate crab, as did the Cajun lobster sauce.  But the crabmeat was silky and chunky and these lovely, hand-formed, un-uniform patties showed they were made in-house.  My one complaint of the night is the heavy hand on the salt shaker in the kitchen.  I'd read numerous reviews about how salty dishes are here.  I had opted for the housemade Chateau potatoes as my side because of how chunky they were and had skins .  They were yummy but had a lot of salt, my salt headache before I'd finished the entree was testament to that.  Same complaint from the other 3 diners.  Dessert was a choice of a lovely, light, airy cheesecake with strawberry sauce or a salted caramel chocolate mousse.  I'd asked Khaleel for his opinion earlier and he firmly said the mousse.  We got two and two and I actually was much more a fan of the cheesecake.  Checks were brought promptly.  Service for the most part was impeccable on a very busy Saturday night Restaurant Week.  I look forward to going back on a more traditional night because I imagine it's even better.",

I had to clutch pearls when the bartender filled a nice glass of water---for HIMSELF!!! I eventually asked for one for myself after it became abundantly clear he was clueless.    The look of dismay tipped off the co-bartender who actually introduced himself! Wow...way to go Michael!!! Michael is the only reason I did not reach out to management...  So as others around me are enjoying bread...I just chill---mine never came and finally my sea bass arrived and justifies enduring this foolishness!  Amazing!!! So in a nutshell---lower your expectations if you've had the privilege of experiencing  Del Frisco's  in larger cities ... they can but for whatever reason choose not to  represent the brand to its fullest potential.    I finally figured it out---co bartender had something else to do and only was there to tolerate diners on his shift and disappeared towards the conclusion of my meal. Hence the lackluster delivery...",

Was pretty busy when we arrived. Reservation was at 8:30PM didn't get seated till 9ish (no biggie) the place was clearly busy.  Once seated we ordered the charred Octopus DELICIOUS!!! I specifically told our waitress I DO NOT EAT MEAT/PORK I ordered the Lobster tail w/mashed potatoes she also recommended the spinach (I didn't know the spinach had pork in it, I'm guessing the waitress didn't know the menu or she was rushing to take our order) thank goodness I didn't get to taste the spinach but some friends I came with that do not eat pork either were less fortunate,we asked for the manager & he substituted it with asparagus & corn that we STILL PAYED FOR! My friend said something & they gave us a free dessert (Cheesecake is definitely recommended, very moist) The manager was more pleasant than the waitress & interactive because our waitress never came back to see if everything was alright.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite restaurants in the City. Sadly I am going to give them an overdue break.This particular experience is now the third consecutive in which the food preparation or service were far beneath this restaurant's stated standards and certainly well beneath one the cost of dining here demands. No longer isolated incidents I brought my family here for an a Sunday brunch; it was not busy and relatively quiet. Our waiter was a train wreck; shockingly. Not well trained, ignorant to daily features and fine dining norms and struggled to have a conversation in English longer than a couple sentences. I could honestly go on about the service but just assume there was no aspect of his contribution that was on the level. At one point my wife and I became disappointed as we listened to a waiter present daily features to a neighboring table and there was a dish I would have definitely ordered had a known about it. When our appetizer arrived it could not immediately be placed because our waiter pre-placed a dish setting that didn't belong with our order and the delivering staff had to stand there with our food for a bit while a colleague ran to get something appropriate. When our meals arrived they were cold. Cold. Not \"I wish this a bit hotter\" cold; I mean 'left in the heat lamp window at Denny's while the wait staff finishes there cigarette by the dumpster' cold. One of the meals was an aged prime strip! Boiling hot sides and cold entrees. Frustrated I asked for a manager, who ended up being one I am not familiar with, and he creepily stared at me from an uncomfortable close distance while I explained our issue. Could have just been me at this point except my 9 year old daughter remarked on the man's behavior. They recooked my wife's Benedict and I simply asked them to put mine on the grill for a minute to get it hot. To recompense they comped our appetizer, which unfortunately felt hollow as I can't remember a single apology from our waiter or the manager.",

The only reason I am giving Del Frisco's 4-Stars is because of their pricing. Their steaks are fantastic and definitely worth the price but their are a few items that are not worth the price. For example, the lobster tail at MP was $120 for the night I attended; the lobster was decent but slightly over cooked and the flavor was not wowing. Most recently I had the Sesame-Seared Tuna, the presentation was nice and the Tuna was well prepared, needed approximately 30 seconds long on the grill. The sauces on top of the Tuna was very good but not enough to get the full effect of the thick piece of Tuna. I also think they could come up with a few creative specials for the night/week. Overall I do enjoy Del Frisco's and would recommend this restaurant.",

We'll start with the Chilled Shrimp Sampler the shrimp themselves were amazing, the sauces that the shrimp were pre-dipped in not so much, namely the cocktail sauce which was really nothing more that Hunts Ketchup... 40 minutes later our salads and soups (lobster bisque) came, the soup had a great flavor and a large amount of lobster, would have unfortunately been the highlight of the meal had it been hot, soup was lukewarm at best.   For my entree I ordered the 45day dry aged ribeye, which I was pretty excited about, however we waited over an hour from the time we finished our cold soups for our entrees to arrive, 30mins of which we spent with no drinks. So here we are 2 hours and 20 minutes after being seated the food finally arrives,. I ordered the ribeye medium rare and this steak was less than rare(purple no juices), and completely cold to the touch, but the 2hour wait killed my appetite as well as my motivation to eat, let alone complain and wait another 45min for the new steak to arrive.  So $194.00 and 3hrs and 10min later I finally got out of there. But then again... It Was Restaurant Week, so really this is all my fault. #sarcasm",

Lucked out and the Warriors game was on TV right in front of us which made this California transplant super happy. We ordered a few drinks and food off the restaurant week menu. Loved the habanero grapefruit margarita, I'm a big tequila fan. We ordered the salads to start which were lovely and basic and done well. For entrees I had the crab cakes and he had the filet medallions. Love love love both, filets were cooked perfectly and crab cakes were so much crab and not filler and delish. Took our dessert to go, after a bite, the cheesecake, yum! A great meal but really great service to go with. Michael at the bar was very attentive and personable even when they were packed earlier in the night so props to him. Manager even came over to apologize about the reservation which was so nice since it was 100% our fault. Phenomenal food and great people, love it!",

Arrived early and hung out the bar, where the girls were fantastic! They were very attentive and carried awesome conversations. All drinks we ordered were great.   Once we were seated the great service and drinks continued. The tables were elegantly decorated and the service was even better.   Decor-very fancy and elegant. Dark mahogany wood adorned the walls and they had subtle lighting throughout. Two stories of tables and even have additional bar upstairs.   Service-Fantastic! It's definitely amount the best I've ever experience. Waiter was polite, helpful, and had a smile on his face. They served us promptly and continued to bring what was asked of them.   Food-again, amount the best out there. Rid eye was perfectly cooked and seasoned just right. Meat was tender and juicy and packed with flavor. Lobster Mac and Cheese was rich and creamy. Everyone was extremely pleased with what they ordered.   Tip-enjoy the bar before being seated and engage in great conversation.",

Lots of low lighting. Server and additional staff were good. Ordered: spring mix salad w/green goddess dressing.  Very good & large portion,did not finish it all. (May have been full on bread) The Filet Duo - one filet medallion had Bearnaise sauce (tender and delicious) the other had mushroom sauce (rather dry and required a litter extra chewing, accompanied w/chateau potatoes and sauteed green beans. Dessert (to go)- the banana bread pudding - outside crust one step above burned, was glad I had my own ice cream at home because it along with the Carmel drizzle was definitely needed. Slightly taken aback at the $4 unsweetened tea.  This was my second visit during Queen's Feast.  Last year was definitely a better experience as far as my taste buds were considered.  (Should have gone with the crab cakes as before).",

I was dinning with my boss in June of 2017.  I ordered a special that night and when it arrived, it was horribly over seasoned (salty!).  I wanted to be sure it wasn't me and my boss took a taste and agreed with me.  By the time it got resolved, my boss had already eaten most of his meal.  I thought I'd just get a bowl of lobster bisque.  When that arrived it was cold.  My boss had finished, I was fine with what I had already eaten.  I'm sure they took care of the check as I wasn't paying and didn't look.  All in all, that night, at our table, the food was not what I expected and I'm sure not up to Del Frisco's standards.  Again, I know they are an amazing place, I just happened to be one of the unlucky that night.",

Charie and Pam were the best servers from the time we walked in including others that served us as well. We thank the Manager for giving us the private room.

I save this upscale restaurant for special occasions. My husband and I stayed in Charlotte over the Christmas holiday this year and decided well in advance that we wanted to return to Del Frisco's for our special holiday dinner since it would be just the two of us.   The original server we had over a year ago got a promotion and went from server to manager (at least that is what it appeared)...too bad for us because I remember he was an excellent server. The guy we had this time had a pretentious disposition about him and it made us uncomfortable. Plus, our server had another table next to us of approximately 6 people and his attention was definitely focused on them. However, the rest of the staff were pretty courteous and attentive.   We ordered the special seafood for two course meal. It was okay, but for the price it really lacked the extra special holiday dinner feel. I was actually pretty disappointed and wished I would have ordered something more like a signature dish.   Needless to say this holiday dinner was quite the disappointment from service to dinner especially because we had already experienced fine dining and service from here before (so we know it can be done).",

We snagged a table about 3 hours before we stopped in no problem, but it does fill up by 6:30pm.   They synchronize their hostesses in an all black uniform... and blonde hair. You heard it, blonde hair. Our waitress Rachel was very nice and the 2 boys at my table approved.  Wine. There are 2 huge lists but they have affordable ones that start at around $30.  Bread: Mortons-style. There is one huge, round piece of sesame crusted white bread in the center of the table that you can rip pieces from. The butter is whipped.   8 ounce fillet: YUM YUM YUM. So delicious.  Chateau Potatoes: Decent.   Garlic Broccoli: Their special side of the day. Very good garlic broccoli.   Chocolate Mousse: Very chocolatey, smooth, and generously portioned!  Strawberry Cheesecake: It's a lighter version of a cheesecake, not as dense. I kind of prefer the dense Cheesecake Factory style NY cheesecake =X   Great meal for a great price. I'm so glad I came for Restaurant Week!",

This is the kind of place you would want to go to for a celebration or a nice evening.  On Sunday's you can order a 4 course dinner for $49.50/person, but I split it b/c it is a ton of food....so it is more like $24.75/person (not bad!). Plus you get delicious bread and butter which you will devour by the loaf.  Courses: 1. Del Salad- This is way better than you would think.  The bacon avocado ranch dressing is nice, but the giant piece of perfectly cooked bacon set on top of the salad is what makes it.  2. 8oz Filet & Lump Crab Cake - Self explanatory....both were really good. 2a. Steamed Broccoli - It had lots of garlic and some light balsamic sauce...I ate the whole thing...  3. Cheesecake w/ strawberry sauce - It is so light and tastes great.  Hybrid of cheescake and whipped cream.  The wine and service was great as well.  I do not like it as much as Ruth's Chris...but it definitiely surprised me.",

It looks like a fancy restaurant that you might see on your favorite daytime or nighttime TV soap opera. After the valet takes your car, you walk into the soft lit restaurant and are warmly greeted by the hostess. There is an impressive sweeping wooden staircase that commands one's attention. My sweetheart and I sat in an oversized booth with a linen tablecloth and candlelight. The waitstaff promptly addressed us.  I  ordered the salmon medium well. I substituted the regular tomato and capers sauce for the soy ginger and wasabi pea sauce with a side of braised red cabbage with goat cheese and walnuts. Absolutely the best salmon I've eaten! The cabbage was an unusual combination, but one I hope to duplicate at home. It's was quite tasty. My Hunny had the beef medallions, green beans and potatoes. It was also very good! I ordered one cocktail, which was perfect! Be prepared to spend some dough!! Our bill came to $98 before gratuity!! It was a wonderful dining experience. My Hunny warned me not to make this my favorite restaurant, but of course it is!!  :-)",

We walk in to a bar crowd that was sketchy (kindest adjective I could come up with).  After waiting in the edge of the overflow bar crowd for 25 minutes, and constant prodding of the unsympathetic, excuse-filled hostess, we were finally seated (on a Wednesday, with a reservation).  They had a two server concept going on.  Both were friendly, but neither knew what the other was doing.  They pushed the Wagyu Tomahawk Chop, 32 oz. Ribeye Long-Bone.  We were told it was plenty of steak for two.  We took their advice.  When it came out, we literally said, \"Wow, that's great that they went ahead and divided it into the two portions.\"  But that wasn't the case.  That was our entree to split.  After a few bites of the steak, which was half fat, we were still starved.  We ordered deserts all around.  After about 20 minutes, we had a server go find one of our two servers to bring the check, oh yeah, and the deserts. There is more, but I am tired of typing..... When we left and were asked about our experience by those at the hostess stand, we express our discontent.  No apology.  No empathy. NO RETURN!",

There are a lot of people complaining about the price... seriously? If you would like a $9.99 steak go to Outback. This is a prime steakhouse, prime steakhouse has prime service and prime food, that costs money and in exchange has excellent quality.

Said it was as good as Flemming's,  better than Ruth's Chris. Chalet Pot. were too peppery for my taste.  Dessert and coffee, normal.  Overall, I would say the food were on the acceptable caliber for the style of restaurant.  It is in the South Park area, so the clientele was of THAT level. Service was outstanding.",

I will not necessarily grade the beef higher than some of the quality Fleming's establishments I've eaten at, especially since I had a trio of 4oz. filets; however, the overall quality of each of our courses was stellar.  I absolutely recommend this in Charlotte for business entertainment or a nice formal dinner. Bring your checkbook, but it's worth it.",

    "text": "The two stars are only for an exceptional steak.  Appetizers, customer service, and sides were beyond sub-par, particularly for the price.   We asked for a sommelier and instead were delivered a bottle of wine that we did not order.  It was fine, but not great.  It took nearly 30 minutes to arrive after asking for the sommelier.  The tuna tartar appetizer was swimming in a soy-based sauce.  The tuna could not be tasted.  We asked the waiter whether an empty oyster shell was acceptable.  Without speaking, he took the shell in his hand from the table, then delivered another after several minutes.   Our $50 steak and lobster combination with no sides provided a terribly overcooked lobster tail.  Had anyone asked how my meal was, I would have let them know.  Sadly, I was never asked.  The mushroom side was also overcooked and swimming in sauce.  The manager offered to let us choose two desserts as an apology.  We were never provided a dessert menu.  Two desserts that we would not have ordered arrived without comment. The list goes on and on.  This was a tremendously disappointing $500 dinner in Charlotte.",

It was pouring outside so we were stuck standing awkwardly with our drippy umbrellas. Good thing the service got alot better once we reached the dining room  Our waitress was phenomenal. She told us all the specials and was very attentive through out the whole experience. It was my dad's birthday and she made sure it was a special night. We even got dessert on the house. She deserves a raise.  Now the food was pretty great too. We shared the Caesar salad(nice zesty anchovy dressing) filet mignon(tender) ribeye(fatty and flavorful), Australian lobster( huge! 14oz tail of a monster) Seared tuna( didn't try this but my mom liked it) and sides ( mushroom and creamed spinach) The portions were huge. My brother said the croutons on his salad were as big as ice cubes! the waitress also told us to cut into the meat first before eating to see if the temperature of the meat was cooked correctly.   Very extensive wine list and 1/2 off glasses Fridays meant I got my fav napa valley cab. I also managed to tip over my glass which is a testament to the fact that I had one too many.   The chocolate lava cake they brought out at the end with my dads bday candle was so nice!   All in all it was a great experience. Now we just have to visit the one in manhattan.",

    "text": "Brought a couple clients there recently to lock a deal. It was their choice and I was fine with it because I have been to DFDE in Boston, NY and Philly and all great experiences. I ordered the ribeye medium-rare, as I usually do, and regret was disappointed. I understand that medium rare keeps the center not as hot as a more \"well temperature\" however, the whole steak was actually cold even the outside and I couldn't even enjoy the delicious crusting from the sear.   The potatoes au gratin also came out pretty cold which led me to believe that although the food was prepared by good chefs, they might have prepped some of it it a bit too early and maybe had no room under the heat lamp.   When I told the waitress about my steak, she quickly Tried to make an excuse instead of just offering to send a new one or heat it up. She said \"Perhaps the steak was cool because the others in your party (my clients) ordered their meat well done and since their meat cooked a little longer maybe mine sat because the staff made an effort to ensure we all got served at once...  I was shocked! Correct me if I am wrong to assume but shouldn't an establishment of this caliber regularly be serving the food altogether as it is surely a common practice? Nevertheless saying that to me in front of my clients was completely embarrassing, especially after I spent $1300 on five (5) total people.  I really don't know but definitely not a normal experience at a DFDE.",

    "text": "What can you say...it's Del Frisco's!  For those unfamiliar, DF is a chain steakhouse that is anything but your standard chain.  The food is immaculate and consistent whether you're in Vegas or Charlotte, NC.  There are two must-haves on the menu: 1. The crab cakes and 2. The VIP martini.  Fair warning, it's not cheap, but you definitely leave satisfied.  We had the pleasure of being served by Kevin, a short guy (sorry) with a big personality!  He was attentive and went above and beyond to make a special day, our 10 year anniversary, incredible.  Simply, DF is a place to go if you want a really nice meal.   Pro tips: 1. Be sure to let them know if you're celebrating something, they have a surprise for you. 2. Try going during summer or when they have the \"prime pair\" ( a limited dinner menu for $60ish that includes a salad, cut of meat, crab cake, side, and a dessert)",

    "text": "I was not impressed with the staff at this restaurant. I called to inquire about the happy hour food specials at the bar and they told me they have $8 bar bites from 4:30P until 7:00P. Cool.   When my friend and I arrived to the bar, we were informed they haven't had the $8 bar bites for 6 months. they do have bar specials for food, however, they are not $8. That is fine, but the staff who answers the phone should know this. Secondly, if someone chooses to get the bar specials and sit at the bar, they should not be treated differently than customers buying complete meals. I felt as if the bartender was not interested in helping us because we did not order a $40 steak. My friend and I were catching up, having some wine and wanted something to snack on. It has nothing to do with what we order or how we should be treated because of it.  The bartender rarely checked on us. We had to flag him down if we needed anything. He did not offer us water when our food came, I guess because we had wine. Well, I enjoy to have water just in case while I'm eating. He didn't even bother to follow up when we got our food (from someone else who delivered it).   I have no problem spending money on food. But seriously? If you don't want to care about customers who order something on \"special\" solely for that reason or because you're afraid you may not get tipped well, then don't have specials at all.   I was surprised and pretty disgusted with the customer service. The food was decent. I enjoyed the Philly steak eggrolls, so I gave 2 stars. I won't be back here again.",

We had reservations at 7 on Saturday. We had to wait a little bit and the bar was crowded. However there is a bar upstairs that was empty. We ordered the lobster bisque which was a little salty but still good. We also got the 8oz filet and crab cakes. Our medium rare filet was melt in your mouth with the perfect amount of seasoning. The crab cakes were mostly lump crab meat unlike other places were it's mostly breading. We also got the strawberry cheesecake and the banana bread pudding with vanilla ice cream and caramel. We loved the latter! Definitely a nice date night place :)",

We were asked  at phone confirmation for the reservation and twice during dinner if we were celebrating anything special. We noted each time that it was our anniversary. We were asked to save room for a complimentary dessert to celebrate our evening. Nothing... I mean nothing came as we observed other tables with a card and really nice dessert plate. No big deal. We didn't chose this place for a freebie. I have a habit of a wanting a Coke with my steak. I reminded our waiter 3-times before the steak and he still forgot. My wife reminded him after the steak arrived after I opted to give up.   I had $500 in a dinner experience for two people that was not up to par. I have visited two other locations (Philliy / Dallas) and this was just disappointing. Too many other places in Charlotte that offer a better experience.   The highlight of the meal was the lobster Mac and cheese. The rest was pretty mediocre.",

    "text": "Kevin and I normally go to Ruth Chris' for our birthdays as they are a day apart.  My sister got us a gift card to Del Frisco's to give them a try instead as they enjoyed it in DC.  We tried to call a week early for reservations on a Saturday and all they had was an early bird special or last of the night reservation.  We declined and waited probably over a year until we thought about it again earlier this year.  We decided to try them for our anniversary two weekends ago and this time called two months ahead in order to book.  When we arrived, we were a few minutes early but we were seated right away.  We were brought water and bread as we browsed the menu.  The bread was great, nice and light with spreadable butter!  I decided on a glass of wine, which turns out to be my new favorite wine.  It was awesome - and Del Frisco's almost made me upset as I could not find it locally and the big box wine stores would not order it for me.  Luckily I found a local store that would order it for me, and I am now happily enjoying more of it!  We decided to split the ribeye with two sides - au gratin potatoes and creamed spinach.  The steak was perfectly cooked and tasted great, although I have to give the edge to Ruth Chris here because I think it was almost too peppered down.  Chill out on the seasoning and just let the steak be the steak, and I think it may have had the edge.  Ruth Chris and Del Frisco's have both of the sides we had.  The creamed spinach wins easily here, it was wonderful.  It's hard to say which of the au gratin potatoes I liked better as they are very different.  Ruth Chris has more creaminess with sliced potatoes, while Del Frisco's isn't as creamy, just very cheesy with cubes of potatoes.  I think both are great for what they are.  Lastly, we ended with dessert - the chocolate molten cake with ice cream and the butter cake with ice cream.  This is an easy decision, the molten cake was awesome.  I think the butter cake would have been better if it were a soft cake warmed up with the ice cream melting on top.  Instead, it was a thick dry cake, and almost crunchy on the edges, as if the cake was overdone.  Would not order that one again.  My issues: The music was LOUD.  When I go to an upscale restaurant, it should be nice and pleasant, and people are having to talk louder because the music is so loud.  Also, it's not as if it is pleasant classical music or what I would call fine dining music, they were playing current music like Maroon Five.  My other issue:  I don't like how a couple guys come to the table to bring you your food, and then they start serving you your sides.  It just feels chaotic moving around the table.  Just set the sides down, let us have our peace and serve ourselves how much we want of each side.  Overall, very good meal.  Just wish the music and service was done a little bit differently and I would give them the edge over Ruth Chris.",

The restaurant wasn't crowded at the start of dinner around 7pm but by the end of the evening not an empty table in the house.  Complimentary valet is a plus.  Staff was very attentive, very friendly  & welcoming.  Very elegant restaurant with a nice ambiance.  Food was superb, I ordered a pre-fix option which started with ceasar salad, main dish salmon & 1 lump crabcake with a side of asparagus it was delicious. The  waiter was kind enough to advise that the side portions were shareable so we may all want to get something different so we'd have options which we did, so I also had garlic potatoes & creamed spinach.  When we first were seated there was a Bday card on the table signed by the individual staff members that evening and the end of dinner she received a complimentary dessert. Valet dude even took a group pic for us in front of the restaurant. Looking forward to my next visit.",

The crab was already cracked and open, so definitely a convenient way to eat crab at a nice dinner. Dinner: The Sesame Seared Tuna steak was the best I've had! Loved the temperature and the wasabi creme was a perfect match!  Side: It felt like Thanksgiving picking the loaded sweet potato.

Our waiter was preoccupied serving the table of 4 beside us whom we tried not to but ended up complaining about on our way out for yelling and the incessant stumbling into our table and knocking my purse over and a drink. We didn't eat dessert because we were extremely fed up after 2 1/2 hours of trying to enjoy an intimate dinner alone. We were passed off to another waiter to bring us our drinks and food for the entire night. But when it came time for the check our original waiter was taking credit for the night. Im trying to stay positive because I believe we just had a bad experience due to the people around us. Might try it again in the future.",

My boyfriend made a reservation for Valentine's Day a month in advance, & we still had the only options of the 3:00pm or 9:15pm reservation. No big deal, we understood that this was a busy night for them. When we arrived the restaurant was half empty.....  The Valentine's Day menu did not offer much in the way of options. Steak, steak, & more steak. I get it, it's a steak house. I decided to go with the 8oz lobster tail. Which was surprisingly HUGE, I was not complaining. Boyfriend got a steak cooked to perfection. The table stayed dirty. If at a less expensive restaurant, I would never even comment on this, but this stands out to me when the check is going to be $150+. Drinks were very weak, but of course very expensive. So now is when things really started spiraling down.  When we received the check my lobster tail was $120!!!!! Jeeze!! I asked the waiter to explain & I guess he had rang in the 20oz tail. They did correct this, but blame shifted it on us. I WOULD NEVER EVER SPEND $120 on a lobster tail.. That's just bonkers. Before we got the check, my boyfriend went outside to inform valet that we were ready to go. I noticed a long line of people at the bar waiting for their cars. 30 MINUTES LATER! Still no car. 45 minutes later NO CAR! Boyfriend outraged spoke with the manager, who was sarcastic and had a serious attitude. Valet lied and said that they had pulled the car around, but reparked it due to no one coming to get it. Lies! The manager could only respond saying it was a 3rd party valet company.... Okay so what? If they suck this bad, get another valet company.  We will not be back. There are plenty of high end steak houses, with more class in Charlotte fortunately. Capital Grill remains my favorite.",

    "text": "This review is based on two visits here recently. I had never been here before and had heard great things from most people. I was a little torn with the 2 star review, as the service was definitely very good and attentive, but overall I have had equally good service and better food at many other steakhouses. The decor is nice and fancy, but I just can't get past the food.  For the first visit, I naturally went with a steak and chose the ribeye, which turned out to be an average cut and preparation of meat. It was marginally overcook past my desire for medium rare. My criteria has always been, if I can make a better steak at home, why am I bothering to go out and pay extra for it, and this steak fell into that category. The fried oyster appetizer seemed to be thrown together with poorly fried oysters. The best thing on the first visit was probably the calamari.  On the second visit, I thought that I would try a special for the night and I went with the scallops with ramps. This meal wound up being a tale or meal of two stories with half my dish being bland and the other half being over salty. By this I mean that half the scallops were under seasoned while the other half were over seasoned. I am not even sure how this is possible. I was halfway through the dish by the time I realized this was the case. Again the calamari was the star of the evening other than the fancy wines being ordered by others during this business type dinner.   One last thing, I just wish that one steakhouse had the guts to try and venture out with some new side dishes other than the tired same ones found everywhere. I guess the star of the show is the steak, so they can't or don't want to change the approach. I think based on all that I have expressed \"meh, I've had better\" is appropriate.",

    "text": "I am writing to make you aware of the poor service and food quality we received on Sat  September 30, 2017 at the Charlotte, NC location. We were a party of 10 that was in town for a work related conference. One of our customers suggested we give your restaurant a try. Our evening started out pleasantly. After receiving appetizers, it took almost 45 minutes for someone to return to remove our dishes . We waited at least another hour before our entrees were served. Our entrees and most, if not all, of the accompanying sides were lukewarm at best. Steaks were not prepared as requested. Some of the vegetable sides were cold. Upon asking for the manager, our host was told they would \"comp\" us a few bottles of wine. When one of the other guests suggested that the food was not prepared per NC food codes and in fact could have caused illness. Another manager offered to remove the food charges.  I'm am quite sure your company would be as dissatisfied w/the poor level of service as well as poor food quality. Unfortunately, as the meals took so long, we had time to talk w/other diners and we saddened to hear at least 4 other parties had experienced similar experiences that evening.  I'm very disappointed in the extremely poor quality of food and service for what is known as a top tier restaurrant.  Perhaps your corporate office should investigate this location,",

The fillet was cooked perfectly to order but I did not have anything that really knocked my socks off. One minor complaint is that cokes are the little glass bottles, which in my opinion, is awesome, until you realize that the coke is not chilled and it is poured over ice in a glass. Come on, who doesn't like a cold coke straight from the glass bottle.   I will say that the cheesecake's crust is very good. It must have some ground nuts and a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg in it. Most of us as the table took a few bites of the actual cheesecake filling, which was fine, (I prefer dense cheesecake rather than airy) and then ate all the crust around it. Now if they just served that crust crumbled over a housemade ice cream, that would have been worth another star.",

    "text": "I have to say I expected a one of a kind experience and I was underwhelmed. Whether it's Tuesday or a Saturday, if you are charged top dollar you expect consistency. I was dining as part of a work function so I didn't make a big deal, however I will think twice before returning. I asked for a sparkling water with lime, the server didn't bring the lime on a plate and forgot to bring me a new one for twenty minutes.  Two other ladies at my table had to wait just as long for their wine order and had to remind the server multiple times before she delivered.  I was also confused by their explanation of how they cook their steaks. I was a professional cook in a kitchen for a year and if you tried to tell my chef that medium was essentially more like a medium rare she would laugh in your face.  Four of the steaks at our table were undercooked considerably, and I love a well prepared mid-rare steak. The last thing I will mention is that as the servers were coming around to take the plates of those who were finished, I asked that the remainder of my steak be boxed up. I was very disappointed that no one returned with my steak.  Maybe this evening was just a perfect storm of coincidental mistakes, the restaurant is beautiful and the steak seasoning is like no other.  I typically wouldn't take the time, however Del Frisco's is a popular destination in our beautiful city, and if the consistency becomes priority it will flourish even more.",

Indeed it was!  Beyond a doubt, it IS pricey.  We both ordered the 12 oz. filet mignon, shared a bottle of Robert Mondavi '05 Cabernet and thoroughly enjoyed every minute.  The meat was cooked exactly as ordered and was DELICIOUS.  My husband is certain it's the best steak he has ever had.  In addition, he tried their VIP Martini . . . pineapple infused with Vodka - WOW!  It was the tastiest martini ever.  (So tasty, we're going to try our hand at making one at home.)  Our waitress, Kenyatta, was delightful - personable and very efficient.  We observed all of the wait staff working seamlessly in unison . . . all of the employees seemed to get along perfectly and serving us was their foremost thought.  We were happy to tell the manager about our great experience, and he also was a delight, kind enough to come by our table right away, at our request.  We will look forward with great anticipation to our next meal here. WORTH EVERY PENNY!",

We had a reservation for 8pm and it took about 15 minutes or so to get our table - however, we pleasantly passed the time at the bar. Being 7 months pregnant the busy bartender whipped me up a delicious juice cocktail and only charged us for my husband's drink - unnecessary but really nice. Thumbs up from the start.    Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu, making mostly excellent suggestions and even offering to split our salad knowing I was hesitant to order an appetizer and a salad before my meal. Our waiter suggested my husband and I share a crabcake and a 6 piece shrimp cocktail - each shrimp with a different sauce. Fabulous suggestion - great way to start the meal! The only hiccup at this point was that we were not served any water for at least 20 minutes after being seated. My husband had a drink so he didn't care but I was parched!    For dinner, I ordered the 8 oz filet and my husband ordered the strip.  Our waiter suggested the creamed spinach as a side dish. By far, my filet was the best steak I have ever had. Perfectly cooked, beautiful light pepper crunch in every bite. I savored every forkful! Unfortunately,  the spinach was kind of bland so I took one bite and decided to enjoy my pure-beef meal instead of lessening the experience with my mediocre side.   We opted not to have dessert - maybe next time we will skip the apps and give dessert a try. When our check came we were double charged for our appetizers but our server apologized and quickly returned with an amended check.    The service was truly seamless and never stuffy. Great food, great service. Fantastic place for a special night out.",

While we were waiting outside the hostess gave us ice water and checked on our table which was very considerate. Atmosphere was great! Nice and open, floor to ceiling windows with a dining area on the main floor and upstairs. Very clean, organized, staff was welcoming and accommodating. The bread and whipped butter was amazing. I would have liked it pre sliced instead of whole. That way your party won't have to put their hands all over the loaf. Cutting the soft warm bread was a challenge with a butter knife that was not sharp enough causing the the bread to flatten and compact. My wife, daughter and I ordered the filet mignon medium rare with Ceasar salad and cheesecake or bread pudding for dessert. We did not care to much for the Ceasar salad. It had a slight bitter taste taste to it but was not horrible. Our filets were cooked and seasoned perfectly! The filet was extremely tender and in my top five of best filets. The mashed potatoes were slightly lumpy not the worst I have ever had and a little to much pepper. I recommend asked your waiter/waitress to hold the pepper on the potatoes and add pepper yourself. As far as the filets, they nailed it perfectly. For desert, my wife ordered cheesecake and my daughter and I ordered the bread pudding. Many posts on yelp say the bread pudding is amazing. This is the first time I ever had bread pudding and my daughter and I did not care for it. So I would say it's a personal preference. I did not order cheesecake because I'm one of the rare few people on the planet who does not enjoy cheesecake. I tried my wife's cheesecake and I was blown away. BEST CHEESECAKE I HAVE EVER HAD! The cake was not rich and tasted creamy like a very heavy whipped cream. Regular menu prices were pretty expensive. Unfortunately it's a place I would not attend on a regular basis and only special occasions but they are a good bet. I did feel a little rushed by our waitress maybe because it was restaurant week and they were a little busier than normal. Check was delivered before I was finished with dessert and bread was taken away toward the end of our entree without being asked if we were finished. Overall, I was very satisfied with their hospitality and the quality of the meat. I would recommend them and I go would back.",

Apparently know one has ever been to a real fine dining restaurant as this place would have 2 stars consistently. This is essentially Olive Garden but more expensive.  Servers, you set with the left, you crumb every meal, you take with the right.  Serve the sides with tongs instead of two upside down forks.  Fundamentals!  Also, when I ask you the size of the scallops (U10), you should know that off the top of your head.  And scallops are cooked to temp so ask!  I don't want to know about your kids or have a long conversation with you.  You are here to be the backdrop to a fantastic experience instead of endearing me to your personality for a tip.

    "text": "For the past two years I have taken my son here for his Birthday. For that special occasion he loves it.  I travel nationally and have spent 30 years eating at every kind of restaurant imaginable.  Del Frisco's knows how to wait on a table. They bring out a server for each person at the table so you are all served at the same time. I have always thought this is a great piece of theater for any restaurant.  They serve good steaks - good quality meat.  They have an extensive wine list.  The food other than the meat is nowhere near the quality of the meat. I know this is a steak house and so maybe no one else cares. But over the past five years or so I have enjoyed watching restaurants  set themselves above their competition by paying a lot more attention to the rest of the meal beyond the meat.  We had mushrooms and creamed corn. I would guess that both came out of a can or jar from Institutional Food House. The mushrooms seemed micro waved. The creamed corn traded some spices for being actually creamed. No cream anywhere near my corn.  I would enjoy Del Frisco's much more if the sides were fresh and local.             Maybe from the local farmers market.  If the sides were as good as the steak it would certainly make this more of a destination.  At this point it is a place to take someone once to impress them with how much you spend, not with how much you enjoy great food.",

Staff was excellent - they knew the menu and options, served everything together and were quite friendly.  Appetizers were scrumptious - esp the tuna, and served in a great spread.  Dinner options were beef and salmon (9 out of 10 had beef).  It was perfectly done for each person (but a bit salty at our table).   Highly recommend.",

Their steaks are always melt in your mouth, even their salads are some of the best I've had (Del's salad is a must try), amazing crab cakes, the best banana bread pudding, the list goes on. The only negative is the price. However, they do have a Prime Pair menu in the summer, and they participate in Queen's Feast.",

    "text": "Made a reservation and showed up on time. I still had to wait twenty minutes while they seated five other groups before me. All without acknowledging me, I finally asked how much longer and the hostess had said they were waiting for a table to open up and again seated two other groups. Getting frustrated I told her I would wait outside since there really isn't any place to sit and wait besides the bar she then said my table was ready.             Mind you I went in for date night on a Sunday, ordered a steak and potatoes green beans. Green beans were crunchy and flavorless the potatoes were awful bland mixed with skins . The steak was the best thing on the menu. Lobster bisque Soup was salty I about died of thirst during dinner.  But here is the kicker : how long we had to wait for our food I watched people get sat down after us and their food had came out before ours. I am talking about at least four other tables, We waited 30 minutes for our soup and salad and an additional 45 minutes for the steak.  In which a manager comes with his flashlight to ask if it was cooked to our liking, Not I am sorry for your long wait. I mean this is an upscale restaurant we shouldn't  have to wait over an hour for our main entree.     The service: waitress never came buy to check on us had to track her down so we could get a refill on drinks. Even then she was a bit rude and acted as if we were bothering her. I had told her I wanted a glass of wine and with that she opened up the bottle section were they are selling the 2500 dollar wine bottles. I just wanted a glass of wine not a bottle or a 2500 bottle at that. She had taken our order and that was the last I would not see her again until the check, she didn't ask if wanted so nothing else or if wanted more drinks nothing. The service was awful do I have to buy a bottle just to get my drink refilled? Service is sub par and the food mediocre.",

The steaks  are very inconsistent with how they come out. The drinks are way overpriced for what they are. Overall the food is tasty but not worth the price. Now the atmosphere is wonderful and it is generally a great vibe in there. And, if you're spending a lot of money, they would definitely tend to you great.  Del Frisco's, please consider this; If a customer is sitting at the bar and they order a cocktail or glass of wine, it would be so nice if you offered some complementary olives or chips as many other fine dining restaurant that I've been to seem to do that.        To pay what you charge for a cocktail and it's not even overly strong, you need to offer a little bit something more.  I stopped going here because of how overpriced they are. I would love for them to rethink about some fun perks at their bar to get a newer and more lively crowd in there.",

We had a group of 10 so we split a number of the appetizers and sides. All of them were good but the real stand outs were the calamari and the lobster Mac and cheese.  I cant stress how good the lobster Mac and cheese was. I tried both the VIP martini and the bacon and barrel cocktail. The VIP martini was fantastic, that is a strong recommendation. For my meal I had the dry aged rib eye. The quality of the steak was of the highest quality and it was cooked well.  I have eaten steak all over the country and this was easily in the top three I have had.",

I must have picked all the wrong items last week.  First, the bar menu has a shrimp and scallop ceviche which sounded delicious.  On arrival it was clear that this is not a ceviche, but a mayonnaise based shrimp salad.  Upon inquiry, the manager admitted that the seafood was boiled and not cooked in citrus acid and the description was misleading.  Second, I was trying to choose between the heirloom tomato and burrata salad or the beefsteak tomato and onion salad.  The waiter recommended the burrata.  Upon arrival, the tomatoes were roma and cherry tomatoes, not heirloom.  Another apology.  Lastly, the wine I ordered was a 2012 Napa Cabernet (a fine year for Napa Cabs).  The waiter brought the 2013 because they were out of 2012.  Very sad.  A fine dining establishment like Del Frisco's should not be misleading its customers.  I eat here all the time but its going to be a while before they regain my trust.  Shame, shame, shame.",

    "text": "Del Frisco's will always be an above average dining experience, but this particular location never disappoints. It's convenient location makes dining an easy ritual after a day of shopping at SouthPark.  From my experience, it's best to make reservations.  I've almost starved waiting during \"high volume times\" lol.  Their lobster tails are huge, tender, fresh, and cook to perfection.  Pricey for a normal dinner, but definitely worth sharing for special occasions.  The filet and ribeye are great, and the salmon on the menu is great.  The special I had this weekend was less favorable, but still good.  Crab cake has virtually no breading.  I'm not even joking when I say the wedge is noteworthy (I know it sounds retarded to mention, but seriously.  I think it's their blue cheese dressing I'm in love with).  They have family style sides, so show you care...share.  Additional thoughts: -I'm not crazy about the creamed corn; it's a little bland compared to others I've tried. -The sweet potato casserole is a must!   -The spinach is creamed, so for those carb conscious diners like myself should get the asparagus. -If you start on the bread you probably will never stop. -Creme brulee is **white chocolate** (OMG) -PRIME PAIR is an AMAZING deal, but theres significant up charges for some substitutions.    Oh, and the wait staff is a hit or miss, and the floor has been a little slippery at times so be mindful of footwear.  Ladies parts of the Barclay Downs shopping plaza is also hard to walk through in heels.",

We started with the Beef Carpaccio. Highly recommend. It was so delicious. I ordered the steamed lobster tail... this is the only reason I'm knocking off a star. I took one bite and was overwhelmed by the taste of what seemed like cleaner or bleach. I could barely get the bite down. I asked my boyfriend to try a bite and he tasted it too. It was so bad that it burned my nose a bit. I had to send it back, which I have never done in my life. After we left I looked up \"chemical taste in lobster tail\" and it looks like an ammonia taste is a sign the lobster was not sourced from cold water and was not frozen quickly enough. I got an 8oz filet instead. Best steak I've ever had, hands down. The staff was extremely accommodating considering I was sending back a $120 item and replacing it with a $45 item. We will be back, but definitely won't be ordering the lobster.",

The whole plate was room temperature and took about three minutes to eat.  My husband ordered the lamp chops that cost $49.00 and that was all for that price. No side dish, just the chops and they were cooked to almost well done and he ordered them medium. His side dish was $15.00 extra.  My son enjoyed his 2 crab cakes, but for over $30.00, they were a small portion also. 3 domestic bottles of beer was almost $20.00? Why? We sat with empty dishes for over 15 minutes before someone came to clear them away and waited another 10 minutes before our waitress brought the check.

    "text": "So, turns out I forgot to write about this restaurant... Interesting. Anyways, my most recent at this restaurant was just this past week and this was my second time visiting this restaurant. Going inside, you definitely know that this place is a high class type of restaurant (at least going by the way it looks). Both times, I used the valet service because well, I'm too lazy to figure out where to park as the parking lots are a little hidden from the view. My suggestion is to go find it. Reserve your spot and arrive a little early to just do that.  The first time, when I ate at this restaurant it was busy. Our food came fast, it was good. No complaints there. If I did write my review then it would have been 4 stars, easily. This time though, lets just say as you can see my rating I wasn't so fond of it.  So sitting down we were given our menus and were told the prices of some of the specials they had. They had lobster tail specials, and were they expensive. $6/ounce and it goes up to $150 for I believe 24 ounces. Now, you must be wondering why so expensive? Well, they're \"Australian Lobsters.\" Yeah, you heard it. Luckily my father had a mad craving to have lobster so he just bought an 8 ounce lobster tail for $48.   Now when they say just lobster, it seriously just a lobster. If you ordered it you would probably have went to go take out at a fast food joint right after this expensive meal. I mean, $48 at least they could have gave him a side dish or something to go with that lobster. Just a heated dipping tray of butter and well, an 8 ounce lobster. But, I guess that's something you sacrifice when you go to expensive restaurants. Money, for less food.  I ordered the special, pan seared scallops with basically mashed potatoes (which they named it a little different, something with \"au gratin\" which is actually just a way to prepare it.) The scallops weren't bad,  just nothing special in my opinion. I also ordered the Strawberry Romanov dessert which was actually just 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream with a few slices of strawberry and a piece of mint. For $8, that's really high class there Del Frisco, really.  Now, lets go onto the service. Note, my first time when I came here it was really busy and my food came out really fast. On top of that my party size was the same. This time, we got served an hour later. Within that hour, 30 minutes of that was with no bread, no asking of what we needed. Nothing. So, stupidly we just sat there talking and wondering where our service was. We had a table that sat behind us who came in about 30 minutes in and get their food faster than we did.   I think I have come to reason why this happened. When we were ordering our food we were a little picky on what we ate because of the price. So, I guess this is the backlash of trying to be somewhat reasonable to spend. Discriminating against those who didn't want to break their savings account for a meal.   I wish this review was only about the food, as I really don't like to complain so much on service. But, at the price we were paying for eating there I think everything should be perfect. Especially on a night when no one was there!   I won't come back here, unless someone else is picking up the tab and its a party. You can spend your money more wisely and if you do want to go to a high class restaurant I recommend you to go elsewhere. Big disappointment on the second time here, I guess this restaurant is one of those \"One hit wonders\".",

We arrived on a busy Friday night to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary. We were seated right away and was given a nice card wishing us a happy anniversary - Nice touch!  We decided to forgo appetizers because we knew we were going to double up on some side dishes. I chose the salmon and my husband chose the shrimp scampi with pasta. Both of our entrees were great - cooked perfectly.  And the shrimp in scampi with pasta were gigantic! Now for our side dishes - we had the onion rings and the lobster mac and cheese.  Those two sides alone could make a meal!  The onion rings were down right huge!  They were crisp and hot.  And the lobster mac and cheese is the best in my opinion.... creamy and oh so decadent.with chunks of lobster - tails too, not just claws!  The service was very attentive and friendly. They treated us to a dessert for our anniversary and we chose the special butter cake with butter pecan ice cream.  Oh my! That butter cake needs to be a permanent fixture on the menu.  We'll be back - even just for onion rings at the bar!",

Unfortunately, we went during one of the busiest time of the year- Restaurant Week.  Upon arrival it was extremely packed. The waiting area didn't have any seating and was fairly small for such a popular restaurant. On a brighter note, there were no buzzers or any mechanized reminders to gold onto when your table was ready. The Hostess simply approaches you, asks your name for verification, and escorts you to your seating area. Not quite sure how they remembered which party was which but it was very unique. The upper lever was approaching capacity so we were taken to the lower level where they have another bar downstairs, a large area for seating, and a great view of all of the wines they have to offer neatly organized behind a glass wall. A sight to see for a first timer.  Our waiter immediately greeted us and began taking out order. We both ordered the Pineapple \"VIP\" Martini. They brought out a small sesame seed bread loaf with a small side of butter while we awaited our food.   The Chopped Ceasar Salad was simple, with lettuce, shredded cheese, and the dressing. Nothing too overbearing. My main entree was the North Atlantic Salmon. It was slightly bland in flavor but was cooked very well. Very tender and juicy. I came with some delicious mashed potatoes, a lemon for the salmon, and a soft cream sauce. For desert, the Banana Bread Pudding was absolutely extraordinary. Topped with whipped cream and drizzled with caramel, served at a pleasantly warm temperature. An absolutely delicious full course meal!  Of course the check can always bring disappointment at the end of a great evening. Overall, I would give this restaurant a 4.25 out of 5.0. Great ambiance, tremendous service, and delicious food. Definitely not a restaurant I would go to on a consistent basis, but the perfect place to celebrate any occasion. Just try not to celebrate it on Restaurant Week.",

    "text": "I am updating my review for Del Frisco because I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. We went there this weekend for a special occasion and could not have had a better experience.   We showed up a few minutes early for our reservation and we were promptly seated. The hostess asked if we were celebrating anything special, information that she relayed on to our waiter so his first greeting was of congratulations, which was a small touch that went a long way to give the night that extra unique experience.   I started with the pomegranate martini, which was strong but smooth. We both opted for the prefix menu and I ordered a caesar salad, 8 ounce filet with scallops and the chateau potatoes. The salad was excellent, a rather large portion for a starter but I love the dressing and the extra-large croutons. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium, and the waiter who brought our food asked us to check the steaks before he left to ensure they were cooked properly. This was a great customer service experience that made me feel like the restaurant wanted to put forward their best on every plate. I am not sure how they accomplished it but the steak had that great chargrilled taste and crisp outside while the middle was tender and a perfect warm pink. The scallop pairing was sensational with a light drizzle of a delicious creamy lemon garlic sauce. The potatoes were creamy and well-seasoned and there isn't much more to say when you set them next to such an excellent steak and scallop combo.   We finished our meal with a decadent slice of cheesecake, and the manager stopped by our table to ask how our experience was and if there was anything else we needed. Del Frisco's definitely takes care of the diner from start to finish with excellent customer service and phenomenal steaks.",

I've had the pimento cakes - I cannot keep away from cheese and grits! - and this time lamb sliders.  Great wines by the glass, a little in the pricey but worth it. I'd like to see more craft brews but still a good selection of beers. The lamb sliders were perfectly seasoned and accented with I think goat cheese but I swear said tzaziki sauce on the menu in a yummy soft yet crunchy where it needs to be little bun.  The bar seats are actually comfortable. I can't stand wooden chairs or stools with no backs. A couple TVs showing sports and HUGE windows to enjoy the Piedmont Row view.",

    "text": "To the Chef and Manager,   On your website the first thing I see is \"...an Unparalleled Experience\"  I've had some of the most exceptional and memorable meals at Del Frisco's throughout the years, (Dallas, Houston, Orlando) so it pains me to have to write to you anything but my utmost admiration. However, my disappointing experience happened during the dreaded restaurant week in Charlotte, NC between January 19th - 28th - our group of 6 came on a Thursday evening for an 8pm reservation.   *** Initial seating and ordering were as expected.   *** Some of our member ordered Ala Carte, some off of the RW (RW = Restaurant Week) menu.   The 3 men in our group, including myself, ordered the filet. The RW menu offered an 8 oz filet but I opted for the Ala Carte 12oz - Ordered Medium Rare.   All 3 steaks came out 2-3 minutes undercooked and lukewarm to the touch. The gentleman that brought the steak over to me asked me if I was satisfied after seeing me cut into the steak. I let him know I ordered the steak Medium-Rare and asked him if he thought the steak passed as medium-rare and his response was \"it's very close, sir.\" (later in the evening the manager apologized to me and said the steak was indeed very rare as did one of the other servers). I let the server know I would not be accepting the steak as is and would like a new steak cooked. His response,\" Sir, we can re-cook this steak for you to your liking but normally we would not cook a new steak.\" This is honestly where I lost respect for not only the server but the restaurant as a whole.   No self-respecting Chef in the world would ever allow their staff to suggest re-cooking/heating up a filet mignon and reserving it to their paying customer. Once the cook is done, that's it. If you've messed it up - do it again with a new cut. This is why you pay the prices you pay at Del Frisco's because as a diner you are there to experience professionalism in dining. If the chef fails to deliver that experience on the first try I should never be asked to sacrifice the quality of the meal or the quality of my experience. I've held up my end of the deal. I've gotten dressed, I've put on some respectable dark jeans and dinner jacket, I've coordinated with the other 5 people in our party for transportation and timing. The culmination of events that led up to this moment is now in your hands. The experience and or lack thereof is now in your hands. You failed. Not me. Don't ever suggest to another customer that they should allow you to \"warm\" up their Steak because you and I both know that should never happen at Del Frisco's.   The manager suggested a 12oz steak would take 20 minutes to cook ( should be 8-10 minutes max) and that they had an 8oz steak ready to go that they could bring out to me. At this point I was so embarrassed with the exchanges back and forth that I just agreed. 4oz's of meat, whatever, just bring me what you have. I'd like to point out that none of our exchanges were ever heated or rude or anything like that but it was just embarrassing to have to ask for you to make things right by just bringing me what I originally ordered and to bring it to me cooked the way I asked for it to be cooked. I mean that's just like the basics of actually dining, right? All the rest of it like what color tablecloths and chairs are and color of carpet and what kinds of wine to stock, that's stuff sort of comes 2nd to actually cooking the steak correct, right? Correct me here if I'm off.   I will give some benefit of the doubt to Del's that RW is crazy and insanely hard to manage but this is still no excuse for poorly prepared food. If the food isn't perfect, don't serve it. I would much rather wait extra minutes for the meal and be satisfied with the Chef's accomplishments then to be sorely disappointed by a poorly executed cook.   Recap: (My fiance's Crab Cake were on the coldish side. She did ask for a new plate and they brought a fresh plate.  (RW Menu)  Gent's #2 and #3 filet's were undercooked and lukewarm (8 oz RW Menu). They did not ask for new steaks.  Lady #2 Sea Bass or maybe Halibut was delicious - well cooked (Ala Carte) Lady #3 Filet Medallions (RW menu)- I believe she enjoyed them but she did mention it was a bit on the cool side.",

The first time we each had uncooked beef even though we detailed our desire.  The second time it simply felt like used food.  I didn't even taste it, my partner said it was not good.  Also, the shrimp appetizer was over cooked.  The bacon appetizer was good.  The $11.50 creamed spinach was cold.  They sell a baked potato for $10.50! Lol.  Must be one heck of a Spud.  They were all very nice.  The Manager came over and paid our whole tab (except we bought desserts we we're still hungry, and they didn't offer us an alternative). Naturally we tipped on the full bill as it wasn't the Wait Staffs fault, they were quite good.   The kitchen blew it twice... No three times.    We eat right across the street regularly at another well known steak house.  They never a miss opportunity for perfection.    We'll give them one more shot hoping for a meal worth the price and reputation.",

    "text": "My wife and I went here for my birthday and I was very impressed with the overall experience. While I would reserve to special occasions (unless your pockets are much deeper than mine), I will say that not only the meal was top notch for the price, but the experience is what would bring me back.  Upon arrival it was apparent they do some kind of pre-dinner meeting as every one of the wait staff I would randomly pass wished me happy birthday. It was a nice touch. After perusing the expansive book of wines they have in house, I settled on something that fit what we were looking for with the help of our knowledgeable waiter. From there I helped myself to too much bread (seriously, it was amazing) and an appetizer of a house salad for me and lobster bisque for my wife. Both were very well done and I was impressed by the amount and size of lobster chunks in my wife's bisque.  For our mains she did the 8 oz fillet and I did the 16 oz ribeye. Both were cooked perfectly to medium rare and I found both quite flavorful and not too drowned in butter like many high end steak houses tend to do. We shared a dessert and some after dinner cocktails, which the waiter heated my wife's frangelico with a neat apparatus that held a candle. Overall the pacing of the meal was very well done (you know it's good if you don't notice it until after the meal is complete) and we thoroughly enjoyed the evening.  Upon the ride home we received a call from the restaraunt as my wife had left her purse behind. I can say that neither of us have had a restaurant call us before, so it was a nice touch they figured it out and reached out to us. Small things like this along with the meal itself  helped me justify the price tag for special occasions. Thank you for helping to make our evening out memorable and I will certainly keep this place in mind for recommendations and future special occasions.",

The hostess was kind and quickly escorted us to our table in the wine cellar. It was a very nice space, but because it's so small it can tend to get very loud. However, our waiter arrived and was exceptional! He paid very close attention to our needs and offered great suggestions after we told him it was our first time dining there.   I started with the VIP Pineapple martini and it was delicious. Just the right amount if pineapple to compliment the liquor. For my salad I chose the Spring Mix which comes topped with blue cheese crumbles, onions and balsamic dressing. For my meal I ordered the Filet which come with the standard chateau potatoes and for dessert the cheesecake.   The filet was cooked as requested, very tender and well seasoned. The potatoes were a nice compliment. The cheesecake was classic and delicious.   I'd definitely return to try some other menu options....and to try the lemon cake....I hear it's amazing!!!",

    "text": "\"Words are just words when written but STEAK is DARN good when eaten\" by BianKa Milton (ME) I'm a pescaterian so I don't eat any meat other than seafood however while pregnant I did enjoy a filet here (during restaurant week 2014) and it was DARN GOOD. I've returned on two separate occasions and was impressed by my other tryings. I just ate here during restaurant week 2015 ( I'm from Chicago so we call it restaurant week, however here it's call Queens Fest) and indulged in a great salad, a perfectly prepared salmon filet and enhanced my salmon for $10 to Oscar style (Lump crab and asparagus with yellow sauce which has a name but I can't think of the proper spelling so I won't attempt it).  The dessert was the highlight of my evening. I indulged in a banana bread pudding the only downside of this was the fact that there was no ICE CREAM offered. I was so SAD about this as that would've made the dessert PERFECT, instead it was GOOD and a couple of points away from PERFECT.  Since I've had dinner here several times my rating is based on overall experience from eating to drinking to hostess experience.  Be prepared to spend a pretty penny if you don't go during restaurant week.",

Everyone was quick to congratulate and Champaign on the House was quickly brought to our table.

My only complaint is that they seemed understaffed and there were times where we were wondering where our waiter was. I also had to send back my steak twice because after sending it back once it came back looking exactly the same, I wanted it cooked a little more. I also suppose they're so busy that they can't keep up with who ordered what because I ordered brussel sprouts as my side and our waiter served everyone at our table my brussel sprouts and not me. The sides are portioned in a way that is meant to be shared but I was like hello?? I ordered those. The food and atmosphere is good but for the price I do think there should be better and more attentive service.",

We were seated, our waiter came over, introduced himself to and gave us the specials. After that, about 15-20 minutes later, we had to get his attention to take our order. Once our order was placed, we waited until after 10pm for our food!! Out of the six of us, two of the orders weren't correct. The manager came over at our request and offered desserts to our table. It should not have taken that long for us to get our food. We won't be back!!",

Our server Sasha was the perfect amount of attentiveness without hovering. Bread was nice and warm. Steak was cooked perfect and seasoned nicely, although no sauces such as Bearnaise were mentioned. Sasha treated my wife to dessert for our anniversary which was a nice touch. We will be going back to try the bar menu soon!",

He loved the potatoes augratin(I don't do bacon and they are cooked with that) we had a side of mushrooms too which were delicious!   Oh let's not forget the sesame bread!!!!!! YUM And we finished with mango sorbet which was the best I've ever had!   Great for special occasions. Too fancy for everyday but date nights or celebrations it's perfect!!!!!

I still love this place but even though I live in the building next door to it I don't get to drop in here as much because all my friends live and work farther away now. Sad face. However, two years in a row it's been a little tradition to bring my Mom to their Thanksgiving dinner since I have been back. She loves not having to cook and I love being able to have DF Cabernet and the Del Salad with avocado dressing and of course my fave lemon cake! It's win/win.  She loves their full 3 course turkey dinner with all the trimmings including starting with a nice butternut squash soup and ending with the choice of pumpkin pie cheesecake or pecan pie. She says it's great.   Service as always was top level. I am always surprised how busy they are on this holiday. I guess a lot of people don't do the traditional thing or celebrate it or prefer just not to cook and clean up. Any other night of the year though this place is awesome as well.",

    "text": "We went here last night for Charlotte Restaurant Week and it did not disappoint! I love how this restaurant looks with its high ceilings and warm woods and lighting, and the metal detailing on staircases and railings were pretty cool. Everything feels very new, rich and comfortable. The food was very good, although it wasn't even a consideration that it would be anything but delectable given this restaurants reputation. I had the mixed field greens salad, filet, chateau potatoes and chocolate mousse. Everything was well prepared and delicious.  I don't know if this is new, or something they always have since this was my first time at this restaurant, but they offer the Del Frisco's Power Couple meal (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.delfriscos.com%2Fwhats_happening.php&s=aba4798d5676a1919ccc83b3e2548d36359e85693663b33c112871d595363c5f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">delfriscos.com/whats_hap...</a>) that you can order even when it ISN'T restaurant week. The menu is nearly identical to the restaurant week offering, but is a little pricier at $99 a couple instead of the $60 restaurant week price. Still though, given the atmosphere, service and quality of the food I would consider that a pretty great value.  This IS the type of place where they come by with the table sweepers to remove the crumbs every time they lift a plate, but not at any time did I feel like it was overly snobby or pretentious. If you crack a joke with the guy filling your water, he will most likely laugh instead of shooting an appalled look down his nose at you. Also, it's \"dressy jeans\" friendly during the week, which is nice, although the majority of the patrons were dressed in their \"customer entertaining suits\" or their \"I came straight from work\" khakis and button downs.   I think we'll definitely make this a must visit at least twice a year during restaurant week. It's too good a deal at that time to pass up. Book early though, because those reservations go fast!  *Favorite thing: that hunk of meat can't be beat.",

This evening steak was ordered medium well and served rare. I could not eat it and ended up bringing it home for my dog. Servers always tell you that plates are very hot but they never are. This is not the place to eat if you like vegetables. Vegetables are ridiculously sparse. Steaks served with mashed potatoes filled with butter. Desert are good. Caesar salads very average- 131 Main are much better. Be warned this restaurant is expensive for what you get a big steak. If steak is not great it is a rip off. You will not be able to leave there with a bill less than $200. Do not believe reviews that food is always cooked to perfection because they are not.

I was very surprised to see skillet potatoes & onions on the menu @ such an upscale place, they were very good and the amount they give you is plenty for 2/3 people.

    "text": "I have eaten at several Del Frisco's and my experience at this location was really disappointing.  My husband has been raving about the DF ribeye that came sliced that he had at the NYC location.  We sat down at the bar since it was the two of us and he spoke highly of it to the bartender.  We mentioned the \"sliced\" ribeye several times with emphasis on this preparation.  He said no problem.  He recommended some wine, we each got a glass.  We added a lobster tail and he asked what size, we said just enough to go with the steak small to medium.  Steak arrives, not sliced and close to half was practically inedible with it's toughness/gristle/sinew etc.  We order MR so it wasn't because we ordered it well done or anything.  I had lamb, it was tough to eat as the meat was riddled with sinew.  They carry standard mint jelly, nothing special.  Had the creamed corn, almost no flavor.  Lobster arrived, it was good quality.  Finally, since I was still unsatisfied with dinner I got a dessert menu.  They had a chocolate mousse with brandy soaked lady fingers and pear.  I specifically mentioned to the bartender that I liked the flavor of rum and brandy in desserts and that I was excited to try it.  We ordered it to go.  When I went to eat it later, they didn't include the pear or lady fingers, just bland chocolate mousse.  The bartender was very nice but didn't listen to anything we said.  Wine was 18$ a glass, which I wasn't expecting and we had 2 each.  That is fine, because I didn't ask,  but it seemed a little high considering we told him we were just wanting a Cabernet.  The lobster ended up 96$.  Again, my fault because I didn't ask, but between that and the wine, I got the impression he was more concerned with running up our tab than actually caring about our experience.  We eat at lots of good restaurants and I have never been so disappointed in a $350 meal for 2 in my life.  At this price, I expect great service and attentiveness to the food, but I guess they disagree.  Will never return.",

    "text": "Hold up, hold your horses, not another Del Friscos review! This one isn't all rainbows and smiley faces though. Well, all things considered, they're still receiving 4 stars and I can honestly say at the end of the day, the Del doesn't disappoint.   The stage is set once you browse the menu. It describes how to eat the bread, 'with your hands' and clear as day lets you know that YOU, \"you mean me?\", yes YOU control the pace of the meal. Maybe that's the reason for such limited reservations spots? Most definitely not a detrimental way of doing business.   Del Friscos truly is a \"can't miss\" for restaurant week. Their version of turtle soup was yummay. Perfectly seasoned and quite filling. The steak - even hooked on phonics couldn't educate me enough come up with adequate adjectives to describe it. Unlike Del's adopted stepbrother Sully, the steak here is seasoned just right.   The potatoes were good but nothing to call home to momma about. But that strawberry cheesecake...oh man. Do you like Strawberry Shortcake ice cream? This guy right here sure does and that's what that cheesecake tasted like. Now that's how you finish off a meal.   As stated, it isn't all praise and worship though. Upon our arrival, we didn't even get greeted. Wait, are we at the right place? Is this the Westin or Del Friscos? Can I get a hello, bienvenidos, aloha, anything? Nope. We had to approach the hostess and introduce ourselves and reservation. Our first cocktail waitress wasn't all that nice either.   Normally I wouldn't even give a rat's arse or give it a second thought but these two were almost, almost rude - at least by Del Frisco's standards. If it was any other place, I'd pay it no mind. But it's Del and let's face it, we all expect perfection. See what you guys have done Del Friscos? You're too damn good for your own good.",

    "text": "What was supposed to be a joyous celebration Saturday night quickly turned into a disaster with my party of six leaving Del Frisco's hungry, frustrated and unhappy.  Having dined at Del Frisco's locations in Charlotte and New York City numerous times, we looked forward to a nice evening with friends and good food. The weather was perfect for outdoor seating, but after awhile our server obviously forgot us and focused on her patrons sitting inside.  Repeated requests for water were ignored.  Our food was delivered from the back door 45 minutes after we placed the order.  Every entree and side dish was cold, not warm temperature, but cold.  Two of the steaks ordered medium were completely raw.  Our server never returned to ask if our food was prepared properly, so I went inside to speak with a manager.  As I was telling the manager what happened, another man approached, pushed the first man aside, and told me he was the manager.  (Who's in charge?) I explained the situation and the \"manager\" asked me what I wanted him to do.  It was 9 o'clock in the evening, our food was inedible, and he asked if he could buy us dessert!  Evidently, while I was inside speaking with the manager, our server finally showed up at the table and initiated a heated conversation with my boyfriend because I was inside speaking with the manager.  Did we pay for our meal?  No.  Was it worth the free meal?  No!  Thankfully, Charlotte offers a fine selection of restaurants far superior to the establishment we patronized Saturday night at Piedmont Row.  My next dining experience will be to a first-class restaurant where the servers are properly trained and my perfect steak will arrive sizzling in butter.  A message to the manager - I didn't take home the bag with the two slices of lemon cake that you had delivered to our table.  Lemon?  Really?  At least make an effort and toss some chocolate our way!",

Unfortunately on my two visits to Del Frisco's I was left with a \"not-bad\" feeling. I know everyone in loves this place and it is considered the best in Charlotte, but I just have to disagree. I'm not saying that it's bad by all means. I'm just saying there are better. I consider myself a man of steak and on my first trip here I had the filet. Prepared well, but a little under-seasoned. The sides were good and plentiful and the place is beautiful inside with a 2 story feel for most of the restaurant. Feels rich and the bar area is nice and open.   On my second visit I went with the lamb chops and they came out so hot, it was hard to imagine that they rested for any sort of time. I say this because my wife's scallops were lukewarm at best. My only assumption was that they didn't cook the \"1st order\" correctly and rushed to make the 2nd one while the scallops waited. I could be wrong too...who knows. The lamb tasted ok, but I couldn't get over how it was presented. We also barely saw our waiter and he walked by a few times when I tried to track him down. Wasn't overly busy either. Desserts were good. Nice wine list too!   Overall, this is #5 for me in Charlotte. Will I return...sure, but there are 4 other places I would go first. But that's just me. I have been by several times to enjoy some scotch at the bar!",

    "text": "This was such an amazing experience - the food (with one exception) was top-notch - taste, presentation, reality matching menu description!  The exception - my mom and sister each got shrimp appetizers and the large (!) shrimp were tough.  My app. of raw oysters was fantastic; the drinks were made well (our group had:  raspberry martinis, lemon drop martini, and margarita on the rocks w/salt) and the wine was good as well (pinot noir and malbec).  Everyone's main course was fabulous, and the side dishes were just as amazing - cauliflower gratin, creamed spinach, macaroni and cheese, and steamed asparagus.  And that last one - hot, tender-crisp and a lovely shade of green!  Our waiter (and the other staff we met) was excellent, attentive, friendly (but not intrusive), and helpful.    Just wish I had the income to be a regular visitor (on second thought, it's probably good I can't be - I'd weigh 300 lbs. in no time!)",

    "text": "My mom, dad, husband, and I went here for dinner for my mom's birthday last week and it was nothing short of fantastic. We sat upstairs near the bar where we could still watch the Panthers/Saints game, but it wasn't the star attraction. Our waitress Erica was attentive, knowlegdable, but not too over-bearing. I had the tomato-onion salad with the blue cheese crumbles and vingarette dressing to start, and I could have eaten just that for dinner it was so amazing. For dinner, I had the seafood dinner entree special of a crab-stuffed sole with a spicy tomato jam-to die for! For a steak house, they out-did themselves on their seafood! My dad had a trio steak special, with 2 types of filet and a short rib that I kept stealing samples of. And my mom and husband had 2 of the most delicious rib-eyes Charlotte had to offer. The drinks were strong but not powerful, and the wine list was a novel with a selection for every palate. We love this place for special occasions and wish it was more budget friendly for more regular date nights!",

I visit Sullivan's quite a bit and understand that both are owned by the same company, however I will not return to this Del Frisco's",

The service from the Maitre D, to the Bartender and the waitstaff were all elegant, professional in unison with the ambiance and the customers. Now! unfortunately I will have to set a Budget for every two weeks to return but careful not to get use to it. As it is an experience I never want to tire of.",

    "text": "5 stars you say?!?! Absolutely I DO!!! There is nothing I didn't love about this place and that is saying a ton. This is not a place to go on a whim unless you have that kind of money to throw around for everyday dinner, I personally save it as a go to special occasion place. The atmosphere is everything you could want it to be and the individual attention you receive from the staff whether you had reservations or got lucky with a table when you got there is nothing short of aces! The wine list is extensive and they do not mess around on their knowledge of that wine. If you like to start with a cocktail I HIGHLY recommend an extra dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives, this alone keeps me coming back! As for dinner I started with the salad with avocado goddess dressing and what a treat it was! The 8oz fillet was by far the greatest steak I have ever eaten in all my life.... I have lived in Texas and Alberta where beef is key and though things I had there were great they still didn't beat Del Frisco's fillet! The sauteed mushrooms as a side were a perfect compliment. As for dessert.... Chocolate mousse! Heavenly and silky sweet! Please give this place a try, I promise.... you couldn't possibly regret it!",

    "text": "We go out every year with longtime friends to celebrate their anniversary. Last year was a wonderful experience at the Palm. Not so much for Del Frisco's this year. Our friends were brought their steaks which were fine. My wife was brought a ribeye when she had ordered a filet. I was brought nothing and told there was a mixup on my order. Fifteen minutes later with others almost finished, I was brought a rare filet. I had ordered medium. It was taken back and recooked and reserved in a few minutes, but it was so dry and tasteless. Very disappointing all around. Our main waiter was excellent but one of the food servers had smart comments about everything. We did not find him amusing. The manager ultimately came over with extreme apologies. Apologies were actually coming from everywhere, but that did not make up for ruining a special evening. My steak was comped, which was fine, but I would have rather paid and had a great experience. We were brought desserts as well, but I paid for my wife's dinner and our friend's check was almost $200. It was embarrassing to endure this experience in such a beautiful setting. For the record, we have been there three times and had one amazing experience and two disappointments. It is not likely we will be returning unless something changes. My friends evening was ruined just like ours and it cost them a lot of money to watch this fiasco.",

I have to share this experience because of the fact that there are many restaurants with good steaks.  This was by far the best.  The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and elegant.  The staff was very professional and obviously well trained.  Del Frisco's is definately the restaurant to go to if you want to be made to feel like a king or queen.",
