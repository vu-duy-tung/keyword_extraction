    "text": "As soon as I walked in I was awed by the amount of people on both levels. This is always a good sign. We were seated quickly (party of two). The waiter was very swift initially and quite friendly. I ordered the (house made) sausage egg and cheese buttermilk biscuit which came with a choice of hash browns, grits or fruit. I went with the hash browns. My cousin ordered the red velvet waffle with chicken - I should've ordered that! The biscuit itself was just ok and so was everything on and around it. I was thinking house-made sausage had to be something spectacular like Neese's... not so much. To be honest, Bojangles has a better patty. Of course I had to taste the chicken and waffles and the chicken was so tender and moist and the waffle was just sweet enough to not need any syrup but not so sweet that it caused a diabetic coma. As we were waiting for our food, I noticed the hostess walking with a half-empty plate of food ( I guess she was headed to the kitchen??) and she grabbed something from the plate and ate it! That threw me for a loop considering the ambiance given off by the restaurant. Other than that, I was pleased by the wait staff. One waiter who was not serving us even offered to check to see if our car was still on the street - apparently there are certain hours for parking on the street without being towed. Overall, I had a good experience and I will give it another try. I just know to avoid the basics and go for something more extravagant if I want some flavor.",

    "text": "The service here is awful. Walked in and asked for a table for 5... the hostess didn't take my name and said to hold on 'right there' for a few minutes. I literally stood about 5 steps in front of the stand. After about 15 minutes I went up to her and she stated, \"oh I thought we seated you.\" Then she took my name. We waited for about 15 more minutes and in that time one of the members of our party began feeling sick. He went to lay down in the car when they called our name. We stated that we had four people now - and they said they could no longer seat us because they had a 6-top... and we would require a 4-top. We did not want to be moved to the back of the list AGAIN, so we went to get our friend from the car. After about two minutes, our friend returned and when they brought us up to our table... we were at a four seater with an additional chair jammed into the corner.  This is after them telling us they could not seat us w/ only four people because they reserved a larger table. We saw the larger table open and asked the hostess if we could move there and she said, 'she's just doing what they told her' and when someone in our party suggested we should leave after all this she said, 'that's fine' and walked away without saying anything further. We were left standing in the middle of the restaurant. We looked over the banister and saw they had moved on, seating other parties. It should also be noted that there were MANY MANY open tables. As we walked out, the manager saw us leaving and didn't say a word. A member of our party had to ask if he was the manager. As she told the manager what happened and he did not say sorry ONCE. I have been here before... and the food is good... but it is not worth the headache. The hostesses clearly do not give a sh*t and have no idea what they're doing, and the manager doesn't seem that concerned either.  We went to McDonald's across the street instead and received better customer service there. Seriously.",

We have eaten at the Ballantyne location and it's always been good but food here was mediocre at best. All the salad dressings were like custard and the waiter said there was something wrong but never offered to change out meal. Kids meal clearly stated milk was included but charged extra because chocolate milk was ordered.  Worst part was when we told manager about issue with drink price, charging extra for chocolate milk and the salad dressings being bad he could care less.  Being a business owner I would never let a person like him deal with my customers let alone be in charge! Now it makes sense why place was empty while restaurants all around it were busy!",

However, I will add the young hostess should be a bit more attentive as they check in and seat guest. Two couples that arrived after us were seated before us and the buzzer they provided didn't go off. All in all, I'd still return.",

I went a little early and put our names in, so we were seated almost as soon as the rest of the party arrived, but I heard wait times of up to 45 minutes quoted and people were actually staying! What does that tell you about how yummy their food is? That people are willing to wait & have a morning beer at Taco Mac just to eat there? Worth waiting for!  Anyway, I went for brunch with 3 other ladies and we all found something that sounded (and tasted!) excellent. However, I think I've written before about how good their food is, so I will take this opportunity to highlight their coffee. I never thought of them as a place to go specifically for coffee, but wow, they have upped their game on that front. My latte was perfection and one of my friends called her cappuccino \"the best she'd ever had.\" Yum, will return. :D",

    "text": "Red Velvet Waffles. S'mores French Toast. I love how when it comes to breakfast, you can add tons of junkfood to any staple and suddenly it's a perfectly acceptable meal. It's like calling something a muffin instead of a cupcake...no guilt when you eat your non-cupcake at 7:30a.m.   Thanks to the fabulous Yelp reviews we used the occasion of out-of-town friends passing thru CLT as an excuse to head south and meet the fine people at Terrace. Here are the reasons for my four stars and new devotion:  1: Call ahead seating and very sweet and efficient hostesses. Makes life MUCH easier when the wait is 45min, it's sahara hot and you're schlepping two toddlers.  2: Samples of fresh, warm, house made donuts while you wait.   3: Contemporary yet comfortable atmosphere. You are equally at home in shorts/tee or a cute summer dress.  4: The service was outstanding.   5: The food was, quite simply, delicious. I do think the Red Velvet Waffle was a bit overpriced for what it is, but the S'mores french toast are so rich and gooood. The omeletts are big and full of whatever your heart desires. Shrimp and grits had a nice flavor and texture BUT isn't much food if you have a big eater in your party.  They bring snacks for the kids, deliver their food ASAP and are very engaging w/them. The servers are all helpful and concerned about your experience. Overall, a great dining experience and our friends are looking fwd to heading this way again soon for another go 'round. :)",

I'm a big fan of red velvet cake, so when I saw they had a red velvet waffle, I had to try it. In a word: AMAZING. Not too sweet, light fluffy batter, cream cheese \"syrup\".... Like nothing I've ever had before. I ordered it with fried chicken, which was a boneless, generously sized crispy piece of all white meat, served on the side. I put it on the waffle for a pure decadent taste experience. Yum, yum, yum!  And as a side note, my order came with hash browns, which were some of the best I've ever had. Obviously they were fresh, shredded by hand with just the right amount of onion mixed in for flavor, and fried to a crispy golden finish on top. My boyfriend is kind of a picky eater, and he could not stop raving about how great the hash browns were.  Excellent service, full bar (I had a mimosa), and a nice comfortable atmosphere (we ate outside) all make this place a \"must visit\" whenever I'm in Charlotte.",

We stopped for lunch today prior to a nearby doctor's appointment and ordered the Angus Burger along with the Creole Filet Medallions.  I should have said something immediately when the latter arrived, as the meat was most certainly not filet.  I think it was sirloin.  It also was not medallions, as it wasn't a round cut, the sirloin was simply cut in half.  My companion said that the burger did not seem to have the taste or texture you would expect of Angus meat either, while the fries were too heavily salted.  The service was fine but having sirloin passed off as filet is pretty inexcusable.",

The service good , and my food was yummy I ordered the Banana pecan French toast with fruit and a side of ham. The ham was way too salty .

    "text": "S'mores French Toast. I'm tempted to leave it at that, but I guess not everyone is as taken away with sweet and gooey breakfast goodness.   It was Sunday morning around 10 and we probably should have opted for a faster meal so as to get on with our 11 hour drive, but we (I?) wanted a tasty breakfast. With Yelp as my guide, we set off to Terrace Cafe. First off, the parking garage is a wonderful convenience, it's not creepy or smelly like some can be and free, as well as perfectly located so finding a spot was stress-free, at least on Sunday morning. I mention this because one of my most common culprits of a ruined day is fighting over parking. The restaurant is a classy, fun cafe, with the restaurant seating taking most of the facility, with a decent bar at the enterance. The bathroom is clean and updated, and oddly well supplied (mouthwash?). The tables are all adorned with NASA issued salt & pepper shakers (or at least they remind me of space travel) and spiffy utensils. Enough about the scenery. The food is what we were hungry for, and a quick glance of the menu led me totally devoted to s'mores french toast. A sweet smell of amusement parks accompanied the three thick slices of fried (unconfirmed) french toast, smothered in marshmallow goo and chocolate sauce topped with graham crackers. I easily removed the crumbles (I'm not a graham fan), and quickly forked in. I savored each bite until I could eat no more. And I was sad. Because there was still one more piece. And I wanted it. It was so good. But I had to leave it, and it made me sad. My fellow breakfasters had Banana Pecan french toast, waffle w/strawberry, and hash browns, all of which they were very pleased (especially the french toast). The coffee was weak/bitter, but they offer espresso drinks as well so that might have been a better selection (though... if they can't get drip coffee right, I don't have tons of hope in the mochas). The service was friendly and prompt, nothing outstanding, but definitely no complaints.   Oh, and there was a note in the menu regarding only serving breakfast, I'm not sure if that's just Sundays or weekends.",

    "text": "Lunch Spot when in South Park!  I was eager to try the Terrace Cafe having gone to school with the guy who now owns it and Ive been promising to try it.  I took my grandmother to lunch there on a Thursday around 12pm and walked right in. The front door staff seemed a bit distant and robotic, but walked us to the table up the stairs. We sat overlooking the first level and were approached by our bright and friendly server, Vivian.  We looked over the VAST menu and teetered between lunch and breakfast. Both looked Great.  We chose lunch. Granny ordered the Hawaiian Chicken Salad-Salad and I ordered the Mighty Corned Beef. Both were of good size when they arrived. Granny's salad was a Large scoop of delicious, Pineapple-laden creamy chicken salad that was Super fresh and light, over top of crisp mesclun greens. I wasn't sure what the dressing was, but it was sent on the side (love that) and granny didn't even use it.  My Mighty Corned Beef was just that! A beautiful sandwich of HOT Corned Beef, Chef's Slaw, Russian dressing, on perfectly toasted Marble Rye. Served with Thick Cut Steak Fries, this was a MEAL to write about (that's why I'm doing it). Although we were full, the dessert tray (nothing beats a tray) was brought over. The dessert portion sizes were great, small enough to have a few bits if sharing, and large enough to not feel ripped off! We shared the Blondie and it came out HOT, with a perfect scoop of vanilla and flavorful.  Service was perfect, food came out fast, drinks stayed full, it was overall a wonderful time.",

Called the day before spoke with the Manager who told us to come in with our party of 15 and they would make sure we sat together.  Showed up waited for all 15 people to make it, when they did not show we ask for a table for 10.  They split us into two booths.  The whole idea was a get together.  The managers response was \"what do you want me to do\", nuff said.  When a manager of a restaurant says that the other obvious problems become much worse.  The 4 hostesses never smiled welcomed us or said goodbye or thank you.  The waiter had a lon gotee that everyone was afraid would fall in our food.  He never smiled and never said thankyou.  If semi-good food with real bad service is what you want I recommend this restaurant.  The owner needs to hire workers that smile and thank the customer who pays their wages.",

Stopped for brunch.. walked in the door and there were leaves all over the entrance (no biggie wind blowing, its fall).. that mess just carried on into the dining room. There was straw wrappers and a straw on the floor the entier HOUR we were there... tables sat dirty for long periods of time, the table we were sat at was 1/2 wiped off (the 1/2 closest to the end)... our server took our order and NEVER came back... the runner brought the food, I could have used some ketchup but nobody came by to refill drinks or check on us... eventually the server came back to see if we needed anything (we were done eating) and we asked for the check. The staff there appeared young and not very experienced, there were two hostesses and it appeared their job was to clear tables and clean the dining room... our server didnt seem to have a clue wondering around the dining room. We were there an hour due to the slow service... I noticed a lot of other tables sitting and waiting for boxes/checks. Anyways, the food, BF had shrimp and grits which is his usual... excellent as always, I took ONE bite and got a piece of shell, yuck. I had a BEC biscuit which was excellent.. the biscuits were defiantely made in house and super huge fluffy and delishious. It was too bad the service had to put a damper on our otherwise great meal",

I went in there once and the server was so unprofessional me and my friends didn't even see him other then when he took our order, the server serving at the table beside us had to go get us our drinks. Then when it was time for the tab the server charged me and my friend for the same tab, I called back twice to tell the manager what happened the first time he told me to wait second time I got out on hold then hung up on. If you are gonna eat here just get the food to go. Me and my friend both have bank account statements to prove that we were charged twice. The server that we wanted to tip didn't even get the tip that we left for him because the server messed up while charging the cards. I am a broke college student and now I am $67 short. That was going to go towards my water bill. Never again. The server should get fired, he started cussing right when he got to our table smh. HORRIBLE service.",

    "text": "Ok, so we had been trying to get to this restraunt for a few months. We decided to go last night for my fiancee's birthday, and was that the biggest mistake we ever made? Yes. The night started off with ham and pimento cheese sliders which were so salty, I must have gone through 2 waters and an unsweet tea just to wash the taste out of my mouth. The barbacue sauce on the frenched chicken drummette's was waaaaaay to sweet and overpowered by the amount of ketchup and sugar they must have made it with. For dinner, the fried southern chicken came with green beans that had absolutely NO seasoning, mashed potatoes that were too salty, and gravy on the chicken that was salty. The filet came with a sauce on it that tasted like sh*t. I mean, there was no other way to describe it, and when I'm spending $25 on an 8oz filet, I at least want to be able to eat it. I mean, it was so disgusting. The sauteed mushrooms, I actually had to put salt and pepper on them. I have NEVER EVER done that at a restraunt. It's like they don't season half the food and overseason the other half. No balance anywhere. The dessert wasn't as bad, but how can you mess up a cookie? Especially one that Cracker Barrel also has but their's is way bigger and costs $5 less. The red velvet bread pudding wasn't that bad but it was way too thick and pastey. It was the WORST experience I have ever had with food at a restraunt. They need Gordan Ramsey so bad, wow. DO NOT EAT HERE. I'm paying for it today. O, and the waiter was so awkward, just kind of hovering around our table. Really strange.",

First of all the red velvet waffle just tasted like a regular waffle, it needs more cocoa in their batter to give more of a taste. At least their cream cheese syrup wasn't too sweet. Their hash browns could have used some seasoning. And the fried chicken, is really a chicken breast cut in half and battered and fried. I have had better brunch at the Cheesecake factory, Bistro La Bon, 131 Main, and Pike's Place. It just boggles my mind that there are so many good reviews when their food is just average. Also we ordered a hot chocolate and vanilla latte. The hot chocolate was just water with some cheap cocoa powder, I could have made a better hot chocolate with my godiva cocoa powder mix and the vanilla latte you could just taste a cheap vanilla abstract. I am not trying to be negative I am just keeping it very honest so others will not get disappointed like me. However, the wait staff was great.",

So we ended up at terrace cafe. From the outside it looks like a small store type place but the indoors is huge with an upstairs loft like feel! We had to wait a few mins so I got a mocha royal espresso athe bar and the huuby got the bloody mary! They were pricey but very yum. Once we were seated, hubby ane I quickly decided on shrimp and grits for him and the full breakfast (eggs, bacon, pancakes, hash browns) for me. The shrimp and grits were phenomanal. I might get the next time. My breakfast was good too....you can't really go wrong with the classics. The star on my plate was definitely the pancakes. Sooo good. All in all a good brunch experience but the drinks are a lil pricey for the size. Will be going back to try other meals.",

I ordered the full breakfast which comes with a pancake, scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon and fruit.  Well I substituted the pancake for the french toast and I was uber pleased with my decision (I'm not a fan of the pancakes, but mom's enjoyed them) and instead of the hash browns I ordered fruit and substituted the bacon for the chicken apple sausage (which is a hit BTW).  This place tends to get busy around 11 am so in order to beat the crowd, you have to get up!  They have a parking garage and all of the times I've dined here, never had an issue with parking.  One last thing, sign up for their rewards program and you will receive a free appetizer (however, you might want to redeem the free appetizer for lunch/dinner - which I have yet to try - but they have more to offer for an appetizer during those times versus breakfast).  Great to enjoy with family and friends.",

The chicken was cooked to perfection as well. My friend had the shrimp and grits ( which by the way was pretty good as well . I tasted some of hers. Nice flavor ) we decided to go the the restaurant the next day since it was close to our hotel and I had the chicken and biscuit with ghost pepper pimento cheese and jalapeno jam. Instead on placing the cheese and jam on the biscuit I asked for it on the side so I can place it on myself. However, the ghost pepper pimento cheese and that jalapeno jam on that chicken and biscuit was the right call!! It was one of the best chicken and biscuits I had .. ( chicken was cooked just right and the biscuit was good ) but it was the added extra that made it what it was !!! The server was very attentive and friendly even for a weekend. The place was extremely busy . If I ever visit Charlotte again I am going to make sure I come by this place!!",

They had everything prepared. But that's not the way life is. My blended review would be to say the restaurant is a three star. I say that because on top of the wait, it took us forever to get our food. We sat there for 40 minutes with no food in sight. When the food did come out, the avocado put on one of the plates for garnish was rotten. Most of our food were luke warm and the service just want present.

They are suggestive and always on the money with them. They have consistently fresh ingredients that always come through in whatever you have there. If you happen to be a frequent patron there you will feel welcomed as if you were family and friends each and every single time.

Food: chicken waffles - flavor is decent, but was dry BLT sandwich - Looked and tasted as if a 10-year old child made it Soup - Can't remember what type, but do remember it was lukewarm Steak fries - Had to chase down the waitress to get it. 5 (literally) bandage-size fries came out on a small worn-out side plate...  Bill - Waitress told us fries was included as a side, but then charged us $5. Had to ask her to remove it. 5 for 5 bandage-sized fries???",

When it's on, it's on - particularly for breakfast. Omelettes are not the best in CLT, but not bad. The waffles are impressive. And, for lunch, the Cobb salad is really good. There are many misses here though. The fruit is sometimes just not fresh. The cheese steak is flat out bad. The service is so-so: orders are regularly messed up. The decor is bland. As are the regulars, who seem to be mostly the sort of golf-playing sales guy that are so ubiquitous in Charlotte, making their sales breakfast quotas. It's just ok. And it's in a little office and restaurant center where everything is just ok to bad: it sits next to the flat out bad Brio, the mediocre Taco Mac, and the \"why is it still in business\" J. Sams. George's Brasserie used to be another \"just ok\" restaurant next door, but it's now (for good reason) recently out of business. Compared to the options immediately around it, I'd say this is the best choice. But that's not saying much.",

    "text": "Popping into Terrace cafe during the early afternoon lull on a Saturday was (and is) a good decision. Previous reviews and co-worker experience frequently mentioned THE WAIT during peak breakfast/brunch hours. Thankfully, Terrace serves breakfast all day and I can eat breakfast any time of the day so being there during 'normal' brunch hours really doesn't mean much to me.  We were greeted by multiple staff members and seated immediately upon arrival. We were informed of the drink and food specials of the day and I decided to start off with a glass of pineapple-guava sangria. OHMYYUM. I inhaled this drink, it was so good. I wish I had written down the ingredients in order to recreate it at home...and I wish the glass was bigger.  I had a hard time deciding between the eggs benedict and omelet options so I decided to get some helpful advice from the friendly (and patient!) waiter Ian. I ended up going with the crab cake eggs benedict on a biscuit - per Ian's advice - with hash browns.   While I waited for the food to arrive, I took a peek at the other diners' meals and everyone else (well, it wasn't that many people) was ordering breakfast, usually one of the waffle dishes.   The eggs benedict was delicious! The crab cakes were meaty and the biscuit was a nice touch. I opted for the hollandaise sauce on the side and that was good too. The hash browns were crispy and came out already seasoned with salt + pepper.  This probably had a lot to do with the time of day that I visited but service was so well-paced and friendly. Oh as a random aside, I noticed that they keep stevia in the raw packets on the tables. I happen to use stevia in the raw on a daily basis for my everyday coffee so seeing it available at Terrace made me irrationally happy.  Terrace cafe was delicious and I really enjoyed my time dining there. I cannot wait to go back to try more!",

Service has been great. Today though I couldn't because the competition for a bar seat was stiff. As I am waiting though I notice they were taking parties that came in after me. First 2 parties of two (one that put their name on the list immediately after me), then a party of 4. It wasn't until I said something about it that they decided to look for a table stating they were waiting for a two top to open. What do you mean? 2 parties of two that entered that door after me were just seated at a two and a four top. It would be one thing if they had call ahead seating but Terrace does not. Yeah I get that servers typically don't want to wait on a party of 1 but it's not about them. It's about the customer. Puts a bad taste in my mouth that they didn't feel they need to seat in the order I came in whether I was one or two ppl. I'd get it if I had 3 or more ppl and you needed a larger table but they literally could've sat me anywhere in the restaurant as a single party. Might have to find a new breakfast spot that's on my side of town.",

I guess there has always been a good reason why I never tried this place. After coming here for lunch today with a friend, I am unimpressed.  We came during prime time weekday lunch hour at noon, but most of the cafe is empty...I'd say only 1/3 full. When we entered, we were greeted and seated promptly. I did like our waiter a lot, he seemed professional, good-command of the manner, efficient and courteous (epitome of a good waiter). My friend and I haven't seen each other for a while so we were busy chatting, he told us that whenever we were ready to order we just need to close our menu, that way he'll know we are ready so he would not have to keep coming by to disturb us. This is a very smart idea, more restaurants need to do this!! I ordered the 1/2 soup half sandwich of chichken salad on a croissant and italian chicken noodle soup. I was not very happy with neither the sandwich or the soup. First of all, they only have 2 soups for you to choose from, there is no soup menu, it is just whatever soup is designated for soup of the day. I've had way better chicken salad sandwich, the filling was pretty bland, I did not like the flavor. My soup was very greasy, it came out red, I've never had red chicken noodle soup.  My friend ordered the pimetto tomato sandwich with bacon with a side of fruit. Her sandwich also looked dry. The fruits that came as a side looked ok, but they are just fresh fruit, a combo of sweet melon, pineapple and large blackberry.  We ordered a lemon truffle to share for dessert. That was the BEST part of the meal. The dessert was very rich. I really like the layered presentation, the top is shredded pieces of lemon, then whip cream, then cheesecake, then lemon tart, then ground pecan. Awesome. I will be willing to come back here for dessert but definitely not for a full blown meal.  Also, they serve breakfast until 2:30PM.",

My hubs had the shrimp and grits and they were good. We will return here and it is a good place to try out.",

There was plenty of shrimp, the grits were cooked perfectly and the onion peels were a really nice touch.  The shrimp and grits are also great, however the Tuna is probably the best thing on the menu. The kale & cranberry salad complements the tuna perfectly.  Definitely would recommend to friends.",

Our wait wasn't long and the server was fine. However eggs benedict was TERRIBLE. Absolutely no flavor in the hollandaise  sauce and the meat had less. Come on meat in the south without flavor seriously.  Now this might not be what they are known for and you are thinking why would you go here if that was your order however when you go to a place that specializes in variety plates someone in the party might just want classics. I had the lemon poppy seed French toast. Very over powering and sweet. Even for me who will go out on a limb and try creative plates. OH coffee was good that is why the second star.",

Generally, it comes with a side of greens and fruit. I substituted the fruit for hashbrowns. Everything was wonderful. The food came out rather quickly and our waitress was very friendly.

I ordered the popular red velvet waffle with chicken and cheesy grits! The chicken was really good and seasoned I pretty much forgot about the waffle lol it was about $17.50 for my food alone kinda pricey. I liked the chicken I don't think I'll get the waffle again.

The food was good -- I had the steak and eggs with coffee.  The steak was delicious; the coffee too strong. My friend had another breakfast which she said was good.    I'll definitely eat here again on another trip to Charlotte, but will hope for better service.",

I also tasted the filet medallions and eggs meal, the steak was cooked perfectly and was tender. My shrimp and grits was the highlight, however. I got the sauce on the side (I do not like very spicy food, and that BBQ sauce WAS spicy), and it was perfect. The chorizo and fried okra were delicious in it. Such an innovative dish.

The Monte Cristo was on the soggy side - so it made the sandwich hard to eat. The portion was huge, but the sogginess hurt the overall experience.  The Chicken & Waffles were great! They come highly recommended, especially if you pair it with their famous Red Velvet Waffle. However, the side of hash browns we both got were really disappointing. They were only crisped on one side, so the interior of the hash browns were soggy.  Get the chicken and waffles - but otherwise, look elsewhere.",

When we walked in, they had a 15 minute wait, which is not too bad for a Sunday brunch time. We were seated quickly and placed our order for drinks. The guys got French Press coffee. Only snafu of the day. Even after sitting for 5 minutes the french press coffee was the color of tea and had no coffee flavor. The waitress said there was new bar staff that day and they had been messing up drink orders all morning. Fortunately she switched it out for regular coffee for them.   My husband and I ordered an omelet with chorizo, salsa, and goat cheese with hashbrowns and a side order of biscuits and gravy. Our friends order the hash scramble of the day and a chicken and egg biscuit. The omelet was fantastic!! I also appreciated that they gave us some type of jam for the bread. It seemed and tasted homemade to me. The biscuits and gravy were definitely the winner though! Our friends even ordered one when they saw ours. Super delish!  Overall fantastic service and meal.",

The first time I Stewart Penick's Terrace was a couple of years ago for my daughter's birthday and every time there after the service, staff and was food was still good. There is a variety of of choices on the menu even for vegans. The owners came out to greet us. The only complaint in all my visits was the fresh fruit. So yes I would recommend Stewart Penick's Terrace for excellent service we have, good food and great hospitality just don't order the fruit unless it's in season.",

    "text": "Has Potential  The Terrace Cafe in South Park has a good foundation going but could use a little polish. The inside is decorated tastefully and the restaurant itself was clean. The waitstaff was very nice but it was slow considering the fact that it was a Thursday and the restaurant was somewhat empty. I ordered the Bavarian Stuffed French Toast Sticks, while the flavors and spices were delicious and it was cooked very well, there was very little cream inside the toast itself and only stuffed on one side. One out of the three sticks didn't have any cream in them at ALL. Second, I also tried the house made sausage which flavor-wise was amazing! But they were extremely over cooked and very very dry. My friend ordered the Red Velvet Waffles which I had a bite of, they were very good and well cooked so no real problem on that end. Has potential but could use a bit of polish around the corners.",

    "text": "Heard alot of good reviews about this little brunch place. I was so excited to take my family to check it out. The atmosphere was very nice and cozy. Food and drink presentation was really nice. But unfortunately everything lacking in flavor. I ordered a cappuccino which didn't come until right before my food and it was just warm. I like my coffee nice and hot, so it left me wondering if it had been sitting for awhile before it was brought to me. Thank goodness my mom spoke up and they remade our cappuccinos. I love carrot cake and chicken and waffles. So I asked the server what was better their chicken and waffles or carrot cake pancakes. He convinced me to order the red velvet waffle with chicken. I was told previously the red velvet waffles were good so I went with the suggestion. My waffle was too soft and flavorless and the chicken was under seasoned. Everyone else's food was in that same category under seasoned. I was so looking forward to loving this places because we are moving to the area and it will be in walking distance. But unfortunately I don't think we will be back as often as I was hoping for.",

    "text": "There aren't as many great places to eat in Charlotte, so the few that taste exceptionally good, are usually busier than the rest.   The Terrace Cafe gets super packed during the weekend brunch service rush, so get ready for a bit of a wait.  PROTIP: The tables in the front near the bar, in the waiting area are first-come-first-served; so if you want to avoid an hour plus wait, snag one of those seats.  Onto the star of the show: the food is pretty solid here. The red velvet waffle was delicious and would highly recommend adding the fried chicken to that order. Otherwise, the food is very much brunch-like foods.   The service was spot-on and we didn't have to wait very long for help. The coffee here is superb as well and tasty.  Pros: great food for Charlotte Cons: the wait during the weekend is absurd",

    "text": "This edition of \"Excited about Eating\" takes us to the Terrace Cafe located in the Piedmont Town Center in the heart of SouthPark. This multi-use Town Center features shops, restaurants, offices, and residential properties arranged in a walkable community.  We arrived at 12:10 on a Saturday to a 75 minute wait. Honestly, we debated leaving but decided to wait and that was a great decision because it turned into a manageable 40 minutes. We had a great view of the industrial style loft area and the charm that comes with this type of structure.   Terrace Cafe offers a wide variety of options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. While waiting, we noticed that most of the dishes coming out of the kitchen were breakfast. Although they looked appetizing, we opted for lunch.  We started with an appetizer of Fried Green Tomatoes served with a warm pimento cheese dip.   The Fried Green Tomatoes arrived quickly and were crispy outside and tender inside with a slight vinegary taste. They were great. Even my wife, who really doesn't like tomatoes, enjoyed them. I think they could serve the cheese dip on anything and it would be great.  I ordered the Nashville Fried Chicken tossed in hot sauce and served over braised collard greens and mashed potatoes.  The chicken was outstanding, crispy and tender, but the mashed potatoes took the prize as the best component of this dish. They were light and creamy with just enough lumps to let you know they were freshly made. The collard greens were a combination of sweet and vinegary, and tasted great. The portions were huge, and definitely not for someone who doesn't like heat as the Nashville hot sauce lived up to its name. Dora here. Definitely a \"forehead slicker.\" lol.  My wife ordered the Chicken Salad Croissant, a Hawaiian version of chicken salad on a fresh croissant served with lettuce and tomato and sweet potato waffle fries.   The chicken salad, made with cream cheese instead of the normal mayo, included grapes, pineapple, pecans, and mandarin oranges. The sweet potatoes waffle fries were a first for us, but something we'd definitely order again.  I finished off my meal with a Peanut Butter Cup Latte and my wife chose the Tiramisu Latte. Both were excellent and a great way to cap off our meal. Dora here. Lip-smacking yummy!  Overall I would highly recommend this restaurant for someone looking for a unique restaurant offering exceptional food. I would rate this establishment 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. The restaurant was reviewed by Food Blogger Ernie Hiers.

We got the eggs benedict, hash browns, cheese grits, and red velvet waffle. I wasn't a fan of any of the savory items and I usually like eggs benedict. Again, my husband loved it though. The red velvet waffle was the only thing that wasn't just below 'okay', it was delicious!

The beef soup surprisingly came with collard greens in it, and the turkey sandwich was filled with grilled onions, melted cheese, chopped turkey, and crispy bacon.  I ordered the Egg Benedict Floratine and I appreciated the care that was taken with the dish. It came topped with crispy fried onions, and the spinach was correctly sauteed.

    "text": "Ok Terrace Cafe. The food was pretty good. The hash brown are shredded and they don't have any onions on them, I suppose you can ask for that if you wanted it. I ordered the steak benedict, the steak came out cooked the way I asked. Unfortunately it came out with scrambled eggs, I sent it back and it came out like it was supposed to. My friend ordered the strawberry and french toast, it was decent. The BLT \"was good\" \"it tastes like a BLT.\" That was the feedback from the BLT. I ordered an iced coffee with the brown sugar flavoring. It was decent. Our server was slightly forgetful, he jacked up out order and it took him a while to bring things we asked for. All in all the consensus at the table was our food was good. At the time we got there we didn't have to wait, if we would have, I think the rating would have been lower.",

I took a seat at the bar while I waited for a table during a busy Sunday brunch. Service was good and I ordered a Terrace Bellini which was fantastic. After a little while, the table was ready so we were sat in the dining area. I ordered the red velvet waffle with fried chicken (which I had eyed hungrily while sitting at the bar with order after order of these going out) and my girlfriend ordered a build your own omelette with vegetables. My food arrived but it was a little cold and not as good as I had hoped. The chicken skin wasn't crispy but had good flavor. I tasted my girlfriend's omelette and it tasted like they hadn't used any salt at all. This place definitely has potential but they need to work on their execution.",

I was looking for a breakfast spot on yelp and stumbled upon this place, known for their red velvet waffle.  Yes please!  BF arrived here at almost 9am on a Friday and did not have to wait.  We were hoping to be in and out in less than an hour because we had a flight to catch.  Service was quick and on point throughout the meal.  Not only did they have red velvet waffles, but you could also order it with fried chicken!  So of course I had to get the fried chicken n red velvet waffle.  BF ordered an omelet with a side of fried chicken (one thing I love about the South: you can order fried food anytime of day!). My red velvet waffle was topped with cream cheese drizzle which complimented the waffle well.  The fried chicken was mediocre, but still a pleasant meal nonetheless.  There were a lot of other yummy breakfast options on the menu that looked pretty good too.  I may need to come back if I'm ever back in Charlotte for business.",

I didn't realize the restaurant was as big as it is but they sat me at a 2-seater table that was crammed between two other larger tables and it was a bit uncomfortable.  They have a broad breakfast menu and I asked my server for a recommendation and she said everything was good.  Geez, that didn't help me much.  So I went with the \"Full Breakfast\" option which came with 2 eggs, meat of choice, side of choice and a small green salad.  Also came with a couple of pancakes.  My choice of meat was turkey bacon and the side was the hash browns.    The eggs were decent, the hash browns were made in a round patty.  The best thing was the crunchy outside and presentation.  The inside fell apart as soon as the crust was gone.  The turkey bacon was tough and the salad was a nice inclusion.  My pancakes were a bit rubbery and made me long for the ones at Toast.    Not a great first impression with the food.  But they get higher marks because my server was extra perky!  Presentation was wonderful.  And for your sweetener options, they have stevia.   Also on the menu are YMCA recommended options.  Might be worth another try if I'm in the area.  We'll see.",

My favorites are the biscuits and gravy, red velvet waffle, egg casserole, and usually any hash special they have. The Bavarian cream stuffed French toast is all out of this world, though it is extremely rich. The red velvet waffle is very unique and delicious. It is perfect even for those who don't like super sweet, the cream cheese frosting drizzle adds enough sweetness to not need syrup but doesn't over do it. Really you can't go wrong with anything here. Drinks are great too! Service can be slow on occasion and there is always a wait, but in my opinion the food is worth the wait!",

We ordered from Brio and returned to our office. Come to find out our  colleagues  had the same experience with customer service and decided to go to Brio as well.

    "text": "I love this place! I loved that we were able to grab bar seating on a Sunday at noon the moment we walked it. We were able to \"skip\" the line because of bar seating. YES! I felt awesome because of this. Bar seating was definitely a great experience especially for our first time at Terrace Cafe as the bar is right next to the kitchen. I can see the chefs working hard to ensure that the plates of food are set correctly before sending them out to patrons to enjoy. I enjoyed observing the chefs work while I enjoy my meal.   FOOD - Steak & Eggs || two perfectly cooked filet medallions, two eggs, and choice of either grits or hash browns -- I ordered both. I requested my filet medallions to be medium and they were just perfect. I ordered my eggs over easy and placed them on top of my sliced and toasted croissant. I was scared my hash browns were going to be soggy and not crispy so I ordered them to be well done or extra crispy; however, I found out that this is not needed as mine were too crispy. The Steak & Eggs were just perfect. It's a must order. I'm craving it at this moment! - Eggs Benedict - Filet || two filet medallions, two eggs, and hollandaise sauce all on top of biscuits with a side of hash browns. Very nice twist to eggs benedict. If you're craving steak and eggs benedict at the same time --- you should try ordering this.  - Long Island Peach Tea || Adult Drink -- very good and very strong. i love the twist that they have to the traditional Long Island by adding Peach flavors. - Pineapple Guava Sangria || Adult Drink -- this drink was very light as it only has white wine and is mixed with lots of fruit juices like guava and pineapple. Something you should order if you're looking for a light adult drink with your meal.  SERVICE/AMBIANCE/LAST NOTES Service was impeccable. I know we sat a the bar and service should be the best since we are right next to the kitchen, but I can see that if we sat at a regular table, our service would be impeccable as well as you see the servers working hard to get food out to patrons. The restaurant is surprisingly very spacious as there are tables upstairs and downstairs. Parking is free as you can park around the complex. If there is a wait, please see the hostess, give your name and phone numbers and she will text you when you're table is ready.   Overall, this is my favorite restaurant by far this weekend and I will definitely come back to visit Charlotte because of Terrace Cafe. Many friends suggested that I should try the Red Velvet Waffles with a drizzle of cream cheese -- which I will try on my next visit as it is a very popular item!",

    "text": "I went here for Sunday brunch last weekend with some friends. I've been to Charlotte many times before but never tried this place before but read good reviews about it! There's a parking deck right beside the restaurant which was very convenient. It was a 45 minute wait but the area the restaurant is in was very nice and it was a nice day outside so we decided to just walk around while we waited. After about forty minutes we got a call that our table was ready. The inside was very nice and quaint. There is an upstairs area that allows for more seating. I ended up getting the red velvet waffle with chicken and a side of fruit. Also I was stuck between getting the dueling mimosa and the regular mimosa. I asked the waitress and she told me the dueling mimosa really wasn't that great and recommended the sunshine mimosa so I ended up ordering that and it was great! Also my food was absolutely delectable!!! The chicken was boneless and very tender and well seasoned. The waffle was soft, light, and fluffy and the fruit was ripe and not too ripe! All in all, this place is a great brunch spot with delicious food!",

Our waitress came over quickly for our drink orders and then disappeared for about 15 minutes after giving us our drinks. We did not receive refills our entire meal. By the time we received our food it was cold. The red velvet waffle is overrated but it probably would have been better if it were hot.  Our waitress never came over to check on us or to ask how we were. We had to ask another waiter for ketchup.   We ended up waiting for our check and when we tried to get her attention, she blatantly ignored us. I would not return to this restaurant and I am glad we didn't have to wait for a table.",

We sat upstairs and had a great view of the restaurant. The food is incredible. We ordered a variety of items all of which were comparable (if not a bit better!) than some of the eclectic breakfast joints in Asheville. Between the three of us we shared the red velvet waffle, banana bread French toast, bacon egg and cheese biscuit, and the egg and cheese biscuit. All were some of the best we've ever had. We will definitely be coming back to the terrace cafe. It is a must stop while in Charlotte.",

The cream cheese drizzling makes em extra yummy. You can always ask for extra cream cheese . The chicken was the regular fried chicken.

    "text": "Super cute, well decorated restaurant. Was more upscale and put together than typical breakfast places without the stuffiness. Had a cute upstairs seating area as well that overlooked the bottom level. There was also a small bar area too. The parking deck was right beside the restaurant and provided easy parking and access to the restaurant. Also appreciated that they text you when your table is ready.   FOOD:    I got the spicy chicken biscuit with hash browns (I added the peppers and onions to mine for $1 extra). And it was okay. The biscuit was awkwardly large and crumbly to eat like a typical biscuit, would have been better suited as an open face dish. But the flavors were good, was a little spicier than I had anticipated. My boyfriend ordered the full breakfast and absolutely LOVED it. He isn't a huge pancake person but said those were some of the best pancakes that he had ever had!  SERVICE:    The two hostesses at the front were very friendly and gave a very good first impression. Our waitress was nice, and did a good job. Nothing over the top. The manager did come over and check on things, which is always a nice touch. I feel that the manager coming around isn't as common anymore.   OVERALL:   It was a nice, enjoyable breakfast. Will we be back? Yes! Will I order the same thing? No, it was good just not amazing and would like to try some of their signature waffles next time.",

    "text": "Every Sunday I try to convince myself to branch out and experience a new brunch place in Charlotte. And every Sunday without fail I'm back here again. I just can't get enough of this place. The Bavarian Creme Stuffed French Toast and Red Velvet Waffle are currently dueling for top spot on the sweet side. The Southern Biscuits and Gravy reigns supreme as far as savory is concerned.   The food is 5 stars all the way, but the service has often left something to be desired. Granted, I'm going during what I imagine is their busiest time on their busiest day of the week, but I always feel a bit like an inconvenience to the wait staff.   I also struggle to understand a brunch place that doesn't incorporate bacon as a preset side, particularly with their sweet dishes. When asked if the hash browns or grits that accompany the waffles could be switched out for bacon, I've always been told no, not even for an extra charge. And $4.25 is just too extravagant a price for a few strips of bacon.    Apart from those aspects though, I've always left overly full and overall pleased.   Pro tip: if visiting on a Sunday at prime time, put your name on the list and walk around the corner for a manicure at Cachet. By the time your nails are drying, you should be getting a text that your table is ready.",

    "text": "From the look of the place I thought the food would be better. Why a 2 instead of 1? Because at least my friends had better food, and the hostess was a nice girl.   1) I don't know why the waitress did not like me, but she was curt to me. She was not with anybody else at the table. My friends did not appreciate that either. When I ordered my food, she did not let me finish what I was saying. My boyfriend had to basically tell her I was not done ordering.   2) What I ordered was not as advertised. Don't call something Nashville hot chicken, or chicken with Nashville hot sauce when all you did was use buffalo sauce. I have actually had great Nashville hot chicken and this was not even close. There was not a hint of Nashville sauce on it. My fries were also cold.   3) I ordered the dueling mimosa. I saw the pictures of it and mine did not even resemble that. What I got was a plain mimosa. I was very irritated about that, and my fries being cold.   I will not be back here. If the waitress was not rude to me, maybe I would consider it but that was not a good experience for me. If you have mediocre food, your service better be perfect and this was far, far below that.",

Enough time to call it in and wake down to get it. Usually I can call it in and place the same order with the same waitress/bartender. Perfection! Today I decide to go grab a cup of milk to have with my breakfast. I walk in with a co worker and ask the waitress for a cup of milk. She said \"Ok, $4.87\"...as I'm reaching for the $3.00 cash I had in my pocket.  I repeat back to her..\"did you say Four Dollars and Eighty-seven cents?\" I was hoping since she had just made a messed up on the order before mines and she was clearing have a bad day, that she was wrong. Nope, she continued to grab the 16oz(at the most) cup and the gallon of milk. I quickly said oh nevermind. And walked out. Who charge $4.87 for a small cup of regular/whole milk...a gallon is $2.50 with tax in any grocery store. To Panera Bread I went($1.79).",

The first time we had the stuffed french toast. IT WAS AMAZING! When we returned, it said they were french toast sticks, not sure why they changed it. Also, the first time we had the chicken and waffles. IT WAS AMAZING! The chicken was fried to perfection and the waffle was so yummy.   This recent time we ordered the Lemon Poppy french toast, which tasted more like a pound cake, but it was AMAZING! We also ordered the special for that day which was a chocolate chip waffle, with white chocolate drizzle. I was also amazing and not super sweet or chocolatey.   This is in our Yelp \"Favorites\" collection.",

We were immediately seated and our orders were taken. Although the waitress took quite some time to bring our drinks, the customer service was overall good.   I ordered the red velvet chicken and waffle with a side of cheese grits. The red velvet waffle was really good and the cream cheese icing on the waffle was not overly sweet, so it was perfect. The chicken was crisp and well seasoned. I asked for cheddar cheese on the grits but I could tell that it was American cheese, but it still wasn't bad... I ate all of it. The peach moscato punch i ordered Was terrible. It almost tasted like a mildly flavored beer. the red velvet  waffle itself was $11 but if you get chicken added that's an additional $6... I find this strange because generally people order chicken and waffles together so the up charge shouldn't be so high but other than that, I have no real complaints.",

One 4 seater remained empty for the enitre hour my husband and I were eatting, yet there  are like 15 people outside (including toddlers) in heat desperately waiting to sat in nice cool AC. I was a hosteess for many years and don't feel that it was explained to these girls that  servers can't make money unless you seat their tables. These girls are costing this resturant and it's servers money, in this economy not a joke.",

I've been to the Ballantyne location several times and have loved it.   Ordered the BBQ Chicken quiche for my entree and where I can say it had great flavor, it definitely lacked in structure. Think it was just a matter of being cooked long enough, but it was definitely falling apart. Also, the dressing on the salad as a little wonky. I did love that the fruit on the side had the option of being all berries. Big plus.   The rest of the meal was stellar per usual. Killer oatmeal, hashbrowns, orange juice, and silly, tilty glasses.   Keep it rockin', Terrace. You've got a space in my heart. Cheers.",

The lemon poppyseed French toast was amazing! I will definitely order it again! The breakfast casserole was very underwhelming- there was nothing special about it and it was quite bland. We both took a few bites of it and left the rest on our plate. The cheese grits tasted decent, but had a film over the top as if they sat out for a while. Our table was pushed against the dining room wall- and we noticed the wall could use a good cleaning as it was pretty dirty with splattered food/beverages that looked to have been there for quite some time. Overall, our experience was good, not great, and if it weren't for the delicious poppyseed French toast I'd probably give this establishment 3 stars.",

    "text": "Maybe I came on an understaffed day or a bad day in general. I arrived on a beautiful Wednesday around noon craving breakfast after reading the rave reviews. The decor was lovely- the general ambiance was very intimate and upscale without being stuffy. The hostess and server were okay. Not the nicest and friendliest but not the worst service either. Downfall was that it was extremely loud even though we were seated upstairs.  My boyfriend loved his bacon waffle with fried chicken and a side of fruit. He wished that there was more bacon inside the waffle, but he did thoroughly enjoy it. I had a lot of problems with my food. I ordered a cappuccino (yummy!), the strawberry pancakes, side of fruit, and 2 sunny side up eggs. I could tell my food was ready first and sat for a while because the strawberries inside the pancakes made the pancakes soggier than they should have been- they were also lukewarm but I was starving so I just ate them. My eggs were also stone cold and I had to send then back. I can't comprehend how kitchen staff can send out cold eggs; sunny side up eggs are the easiest type of eggs to cook! After waiting so long on my meal the first time, I didn't even want to waste more time getting a replacement side for the eggs. Our meal came out to $32 which wasn't too bad at all.   Maybe I'm a little biased since I work in a restaurant myself and am super critical due to that. I've had a better breakfast at IHOP than here and that's saying a lot! I will probably try to come here again on a weekend and try to get the amazing, delicious food that everyone else has enjoyed since I have apparently missed out on a good thing.",

    "text": "Thanks to Yelp, I got a chance to check this place out during restaurant week.  This place is really tasty and I can't wait to check out brunch sometime!  Here's a breakdown of what we got to try:  Fried Green Tomatoes (4/5): Great level of crispiness in the batter, which was a little plain-tasting.  However, the pimento cheese served with them adds a great touch and makes them much more flavorful.  Biscuits (4/5): I love that they are served with some sort of pepper jelly.  They are so tiny, maybe 2 inches in diameter.  They were not dry and surprisingly flaky.  Blue crab bisque (4.5/5): Very rich and flavorful.  Full of great crab flavor.  The sherry really complemented the flavors.  Wedge salad (3.5/5): The bleu cheese is relatively smooth in this, so I appreciated it.  I loved the crispy red onion - they were the BOMB!  However, it's a little too much wedge and not enough of the delicious toppings.  Terrace fried chicken (4.5/5): The fried chicken was excellent!  The batter was great, it was a good size, and the gravy was fantastic.  The mashed potatoes were rich and creamy, just how I like them.  The collard greens were good as well, and they reminded me of these fantastic ones that made me fall in love with cooked greens.  Chicken and Waffle (5/5):  Ok, this was seriously amazeballs!  The watermelon salad paired so well and was so refreshing with everything.  I could have eaten a whole plate of this alone.  The waffled and chicken were good on their own, but then came the red hot syrup.  Holy guacamole!  It had the perfect level of spicy sweetness that just brought the whole meal together.  This is my favorite chicken and waffles dish I've ever had.  We also ordered drinks, and mine came out a great electric green, which ruled.  Since we came on a weeknight, it wasn't too busy, which was fantastic.  I am glad I made a reservation just in case, though.  The service was good, but some weirdness came when the bill got there.  I had a gift card for $60 and with the drinks it should have come up to around $75.  However, the bill was around $85.  I called the waitress over to ask about it, and she never really gave me a very good explanation about what the extra charges were.  It was not added gratuity because I asked.  I did not see a manager or anyone else around, and by that time we were headed to a movie we did not want to miss.  It never did get resolved and I'm pretty sure we got overcharged.  I would just caution people using a gift card to watch out what the final bill ends up being.  This was very annoying.  Still, the food was good and I think I would probably come back.",

    "text": "This place has been on my bookmarks for the longest time.  Whenever it is expected for you to have a wait for brunch, seems like they have a good thing going here.  Overall I was pretty impressed with the place despite all the buildup and anticipation I had.  Our group of 5 was seated after about 45 min of waiting for a table (the hostess was actually dead on with the wait time which was pretty impressive).  The unfortunate thing about Terrace Cafe is that they do not take reservations, you can call ahead if your party is more than 6 people (we were almost tempted to grab someone off the street to eat brunch with us to save us on time, but that didn't happen).  After we were lead upstairs on the terrace level to a wide booth, our server got our drinks and went through the specials.  It took us a while to decide on food but when you want to try everything on the menu, it's a good problem to have.  You could tell that the servers here have to work their butts off due to the stairs (I'm assuming the kitchen is all below the terrace level seating).  I had the Southern Sausage Benedict... and I about had to change my pants once I cut into the perfectly poached egg and watched it soak into the muffin and sausage below it.  My plate was cleaned in about 10 minutes and I was full to the brim.  The other (slight) downside is that we were looking to get mimosas and get our drink on, but we forgot about NC laws that prohibit the sale of alcohol before noon on Sundays.  DOH!  A slight hitch in our plans, but we just rolled with it.  Next time we'll just meet \"later\" but it seems like the crowd doesn't really die down.  We were trying to beat the church crowd, but I think everyone else had that same idea as well.",

When both of them mentioned Terrace Cafe's Red Velvet Waffle, I knew a meeting with said waffle would be in my future.   And today was that day. When I rolled up to Terrace Cafe, it was right before the churchie crowd and for some reason, I was expecting them to have a huge patio but no dice--just an inside dining area with an upstairs and downstairs.   I shouldn't have even looked at the menu but did against my better judgment and started to feel conflicted. I've been wanting that damn red velvet waffle for the past few months but then I started to see other tasty items like S'more french toast, a variety of eggs Benedict, etc but stuck to my guns and got the waffle.   It was everything I dreamed of and more. And from fear of going into sugar shock, I finished 3/4 of it and threw in the towel.   I had a skim latte which was smooth and light and priced the same as a Starbucks latte. The french press wasn't too shabby either. Service was fantastic and right on point. I definitely recommend this place for brunch--be sure to get there early though--they don't take reservations.",

We ordered their pancakes, fruit, shrimp and grits and a few other items. They were all amazing. We had a bit of a wait for our table but it was well worth it. (This was the South Park location). Then we went a second and third time and the wait was particularly long, the service was very average and while the menu didn't seem different, the quality of the food was significantly different. So we decided to try the Ballantyne location and we were shocked at the difference between the two locations. The Ballantyne restaurant didn't have as long of a wait and the menu was the same, but the restaurant itself was not very clean, the food did not taste good and the atmosphere was crowded and not very friendly. I have not since returned to this restaurant at either location.",

I actually prefer this waffle over a slice of red velvet cake, which I don't really like. The hash-browns were pretty good, very circular, lol! I've tried the turkey sandwich, and it was fine, but I wouldn't get it again. My servers have always been very nice and helpful. Whenever I go, I like to sit upstairs because I like the quaint, intimate feel. I've never experienced an outrageous wait or an unsatisfactory experience. Their prices aren't too bad either.",

My sister ordered the red velvet waffle, good as always.  My brother in law ordered Eggs benedict and a side of the biscuits and gravy.  Their gravy is one of the bests that I have ever had, I will have to remember to get a side of that in the future!  Kevin has some pork quiche.  I liked this much better than the quiche that I had last time at the other location.  This one was cooked better and just had a much better flavor.  Fantastic!  I had the special waffle - it was a cinnamon bun waffle.  It was the best waffle that I have had, and I really wish they would put this on their regular menu, it is fabulous!    My only complaint was that it took awhile for us to get seated, but food was fast and excellent!",

We waited about 30 minutes to get seated because many people on the wait list had left.  When we were sat we all ordered waters and one person ordered the house Bloody Mary.  Waters came out quickly but the Bloody Mary took about 10 minutes.  When it came out it had no garnish and looked lack luster.  We ordered our food, a Monte Cristo and two chicken sandwiches.  I was really excited about the Monte Cristo because I used to get one at another restaurant but it was taken off their menu.  The chicken sandwiches were described as served with skillet potatoes.  We waited close to 30 minutes for our food.  When it came out they told us it would be a few extra minutes for the skillet potatoes.  My Monte Cristo was so salty it was almost inedible.  The hash browns that came with it lacked any flavor and were more like the consistency of mash potatoes.  The chicken sandwiches were okay at best.  The skillet potatoes came out and also lacked flavor and were sitting in oil.  When the bill came there was an extra dollar charge for the skillet potatoes...that were described as served with the sandwich...and came out late...When we asked about the charge the answer we got was yes they come with the sandwich but there is an extra charge.  Needless to say we were very underwhelmed and will not be back.",

Our Canadian bacon eggs Benedict came out with Crab Cakes, the plain French toast came out as toast without a French toast batter to be seen, the Canadian bacon was super thick, very disappointing bs thingy sliced and crispy, the grits came out with cheese twice we ordered without cheese, the onions added to the top of our hash browns were not grilled and mixed in, the arrived as a glob on top so mushy twice, I sent those back as well.  Not to mention we waited for our meal 40 minutes. We had 5 different people dealing with our table however no where near organized like Famous Toastery one of the 5 we found out was the manager, we didn't realize it. We had to even get up and ask someone for the check. Nothing was resolved for such a disappointing breakfast outing.  We simply had a lady say \"I'm so sorry for all the mix ups.\"",

    "text": "My experiences at Terrace have come up a bit mixed. The first time I went it was good and the second time less so.  On both visits I ordered the red velvet waffle with chicken breast. A figured this would make for a very unique chicken and waffles experience. I was not disappointed the first time. The waffle was crisp and glazed in a delicious cream cheese icing and the chicken perfectly fried for a delectable combination. My friend got quiche and while it didn't look anything spectacular, it tasted good. On my more recent visit the waffle was barely cooked - mushy and unsupportive of the chicken. The chicken was not crispy, but otherwise not horrible. The cream cheese glaze was close to non existent.  On my most recent visit the waitress was not friendly at all. Basically she just didn't even care. Never presented us with the specials menu; it was not service with a smile. My friends complained that the shrimp and grits were too salty. I didn't mind them, but admit that it didn't taste cohesive. More like grits plus chili plus shrimp. The mimosas with a \"twist\" are pretty dang good. Like a standard mimosa but with some other kind of juice - creates a cool separation in your glass that's both neat to look at and to drink. Another ding for the waitress - she never once asked my friend if he didn't like his drink (it was still full to the top) or offer to replace it. I felt sort of sorry for her, starting a morning off in such a bad mood.  Inside I feel like the ambiance is a bit awkward. The restaurant feels too open while the food is meant to make it feel cozy. But, what can you do? They're super popular despite the small size and at brunch time you're destined to be waiting to get a table. I won't write them off, but I doubt I'll come back for brunch. I guess they were just overworked with the crowd and it showed in the quality of food and service. I recommend picking a more obscure day and time to eat here.",

I got the Bavarian Cream Stuffed French Toast Sticks, with a side of hash browns and both were delicious! My friends had the chicken sandwich, basic french toast, and the croissant sandwich. Everyone enjoyed their meals. I could not finish my whole meal, as the portions are pretty huge. Our waitress was so nice and attentive and the manager, Randy, came by halfway through our meal to see how we were doing. The ambience is great. This is a great place to bring family, or visitors for a nice brunch/breakfast, but no need to dress super fancy (although you can, and that wouldn't be weird either). There is a wide variety of food on their menu, with differing price points. You can find something cheap like a basic omelet or french toast, to things like crab cakes and salmon burgers. Loved it! Will definitely be back.",

On our continuation of exploring Sunday brunch places, we put our names in at the South Park location (sits in that little circle of restaurants off the beaten path) and were told 45 minutes, which we were expecting. We wandered over to Cast Iron Waffles (also on the list) and checked out the menu there, just to be gluttons for punishment and torture our already-rumbling stomachs.  Anyways, after about a half hour, we were seated. Gorgeous interior, two stories and wicked high ceilings. After deliberation and compromise, I decided that I was going to get the Lemon Poppyseed French Toast, while the Lady would order the Banana Pecan French Toast. We both thought they looked delicious, so we thought we'd eat half and then trade.  Bad decision.  The lemon poppyseed toast was out of this world! It was super moist and had an incredible flavor, and the berries that went with it were a fantastic compliment. The banana pecan was good, don't get my wrong. But wowww.   I was in a group of 6 and I don't think there was a single complaint. The benedicts looked wonderful, chicken and waffles was a really generous portion. Will definitely be back again to try out other things. Prices are reasonable for Sunday brunch, comparable to Toast I'd say. Enjoy!!",

Presentation was enough to turn us off, from the dried up\"fresh fruit\" dish to the \"skillet potatoes\" that turned out to be undercooked frozen cubed potatoes, eggs were dry, the Florentine Benedick was less than sub par, truly unappetizing. I left most of it on my plate and I was hungry. When the manager came to the table to ask how everything was, I pointed to the fresh fruits which was obviously cut several hours before and told him that I had asked the server if the fruit was fresh. He offered to go get me a new serving and he did and that fruit proved to be Shriveled up as well. Neither the manager or the server appeared to care that we left most of our food on our plates. I asked our server if the ownership or management had changed recently, it was that different from our last experience. When we left I gave the manager our comment card and told him that we had been to the Terrace restaurant earlier in the summer and had a wonderful breakfast and that is why we had returned. When I told him how disappointed we were, he told me that he was sorry that I felt that way. We felt patronized. The date and time of our visit was October 27, 2018, 10:00 AM",

There's a lot of other restaurants there like Taco Mac so parking can take a little effort sometimes.   Atmosphere / Ambiance: 3.5/5 Pretty simple. Think American diner decor, not too dated or contemporary but not really modern.   Cleanliness: 4.5/5 No complaints. The establishment was pretty well maintained. Minus the RSVP buzzers. I think a couple of them were broken so the host/hostess had to come outside and yell out the names of the parties a couple of times. Not a big deal.  Service: 5/5 Our waiter was really attentive and nice. Water was refilled and orders were taken promptly even with a full house.  Food: 5/5 Biscuit and Gravy - Phenomenal. I mean super delicious. You can get a half order for $3. It's well worth it. (Southern Fried) Chicken and (Red Velvet) Waffle - The potential diabetes is well worth it. I kid. This sweet, savory waffle is amazingly delicious and the perfect combination for the tender chicken breast. A filling brunch for the fat kid in all of us.",

The hash browns were the ordinary shredded potatoes without much flavor. The toast was dry. For a place with an interesting menu with things like a red velvet waffle and shrimp and grits, the sides served with my omelet weren't up to par. The place has a lot of awards displayed around their doors and a large group of regulars that come for takeout before work. The staff knew their standard orders and prepared them quickly for these folks on the way to work. All in all, the coffee, atmosphere and service will keep me coming back but I will avoid the ordinary sides and order the more unique items off the menu.",

She had suggested it, raving about their brunch on Sundays, so it sounded wonderful.  The atmosphere is quaint and lovely, charming in a \"brunch-ey\" kind of way.  We were seated quickly and the lunch crowd was already in full swing.  Our server was prompt and attentive and didn't rush us, which was nice because we were catching up, leisurely.  I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich with a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette.  My friend ordered the BLT with extra bacon and fries.  My sandwich was delicious, although I asked for the blue cheese sauce to be put on the side, as I am more of a ranch dressing kinda girl.  Glad I did....the blue cheese sauce (or fondue as they called it) was too overpowering for the delightful breading and tasty wing sauce on the chicken.  I dipped it in ranch and was quite happy!  The salad was yummy, although the dressing was too oily, so I would suggest sticking with the ranch, as it was delicious!  I sampled my friends' fries and they were quite nice, too!  Overall, I would like to come back for the brunch here, as the red velvet waffles sound to-die-for!",

    "text": "I hate writing negative commentary on local businesses, but I was really disappointed in how Terrace Cafe treated us at breakfast.    We are big groupon users, and I have NEVER had an institution think twice about fully honoring a *purchased* groupon just past its expiration date before now.  There is a first for everything I suppose ... this is just incredibly short-sighted.  The whole point of a groupon is to get someone to try something new, in hopes that they will become something of a recurring customer.  I regularly hold breakfast and lunch meetings in the South Charlotte restaurant scene, and thought Terrace Cafe might be a good place for such meetings.  But they have lost my business with this foolishness.  Incredibly frustrating.  The food itself was fine, though I think the hype has more to do with the nice ambience than particularly wonderful food.  I had the acclaimed red velvet waffle and found it ... okay.  Just okay.  It was dense (which makes sense for red velvet) and dry.  It certainly wasn't *bad,* but it just didn't come across as anything special among waffles.  Different?  Yes.  Delicious?  I wouldn;t go nearly that far.  My wife thought her eggs, biscuit and grits were done nicely.  And we both enjoyed our fru-fru coffees.  The presentation was attractive and the service was better than the somewhat mixed comments you read about this place, probably because we went on a Tuesday.  So overall it was good, but not the *amazing* we were hoping for.  (These are honest opinions on the food and experience, formed BEFORE the groupon nonsense occurred at the end of the meal.)  Honestly though ... if you're rating this place specifically on food is it meaningfully better than the nearby Original Pancake House?  Not based on what we tasted today.  Now the setting is in a difference league entirely ... but the food itself wasn't a special draw.  Given the OPH's standing as an excellent place for customer service and a good place to do business breakfasts, Terrace Cafe might be well served to think a little more broad-mindedly about how they treat their would-be customers.",

The pancakes were the best I have had in any restaurant in years and the quiche is beyond description.  No doubt why this place was voted best breakfast in Charlotte. At lunch, my dad had salmon with steamed veggies, which was a genorous  and very tasty lunch portion, and I had the hummus appetizer and grilled cheese.  If you enjoy hummus, this one is not to be missed.  Portion size was LARGE and hummus was delightful.  At dinner, we ordered from the Valentines price fixe menu; we each had crab bisque, filet mignon, lobster and dessert; all were exceptional.  Breakfast, lunch or dinner, you will not be disappointed....TRY TERRACE CAFE!!!!!!!!!!!",

The fried green tomatoes were nice breaded and seasoned and not at all greasy, served with a remoulade sauce and pimento cheese (yum!).  The pasta was prepared perfectly, large shrimp, al dente pasta, wilted spinach and diced tomato.  My daughters enjoyed their entrees, including the side of cheese grits and hashbrown patty that accompanied their meals.  We shared the bourbon pecan tart with vanilla ice cream which was absolutely divine!!!",

When it finally came out, it was not only overcooked but it was ice cold. There was also some sort of orange sauce splatted on my plate from someone else's meal. It was gross. Obviously, it had been sitting there for a long time. I didn't have another 30 minutes to wait for them to remake the food , I just wont be returning.

From the outside the restaurant looks like a small storefront, but when you open the doors you can really see how grand the place is.  We were seated on the second floor and immediately greeted by our server.  Looking at the menu, I was impressed by the array of options.  We ordered the onion rings and red velvet waffle as an appetizer (not exactly logical, but delicious).  The onion rings are tempura battered and obviously fresh made, honestly some of the best I've ever had.  For my entree I ordered the smores french toast.  Let's be serious, I can't say no to anything smores.  It was a very heavy dish but well worth the caloric splurge.  My friends tried the typical brunch fare and were all very happy with their choices.  Looking over at the diners next to us we saw the sweet potato waffle fries, they looked phenomenal.  I was tempted to ask for a taste but I've heard rumors that would be inappropriate behavior.  I'd definitely recommend checking out Terrace Cafe.  The price is right, the ambiance is fantastic, and the service was quick and entertaining.",

In terms of location & decor, I prefer SouthPark to Ballantyne, although both are nice and both are delicious.  I've only been for brunch, but it's the best brunch food I've ever had. A couple of stand-out meals:  Smores French Toast if you need an incredible sugar rush & incredible gourmet french toast.  Lemon Poppyseed Waffle--not too sweet. It's just perfect. Fresh fruit on the side perfectly compliments.  Biscuits and gravy--the best gravy I've ever had on a Southern biscuit. Period.  Fried green tomatoes--you can see from the first sentence how I feel about them. I'm in love.  Seriously. If you want a nice brunch, go to Terrace.

    "text": "This review is for dinner only: We went for dinner mid-week. It was my first time here, and I found the ambiance cold (literally & figuratively). Waiter and manager were both very friendly and attentive. We were pleased to see they now offer breakfast all day long (always a plus when it's fresh and tasty).   However, we were sad to see their dinner & lunch menu seemed a bit watered down. This is clearly a great place for breakfast, brunch & lunch - dinner, not so much. I'm told they used to have a delicious pork chop entree - but it's completely gone from the menu and the kitchen (we asked). I ordered the soup of the day (basil tomato) which was really great! I also got the chicken salad with a \"large scoop\" of the chicken salad on top of the sweet salad. Large scoop? I don't think so, it was a very small amount of chicken salad and it was basically a little white meat chicken, with bland mayonnaise and a few small pieces of pineapple. Boring, small and disappointing. We also were expecting some kind of bread or role with dinner that was supposedly really good and typically provided. It never came at all.   My friend ordered the chicken & grits which is 'normally amazing.' Instead, it was greasy (a burgundy colored ring and pools of grease with seasoning pooled her dish), and she had one huge glop of melted cheese - it was actually impressive, but not in a good way. My other friend ordered the crab cake BLT, which was fairly tasty in reality. It had a horseradish flavor throughout, so if you don't like that, beware. Desert time came, and we were ready for our peanut butter pie! They were looking forward to it all week. We ordered it, and the waiter joked, \"Great, where's the peanut butter pie coming from?\"   We thought he was teasing us, but we learned they keep changing the menu and completely did away with the peanut butter pie. Saddened, we skipped desert and paid. Food was OK at best, but amid their seeming transformation at the moment, they're a bit lost. We probably won't return to this frigid (temperature), drab (ambiance) and lackluster menu. Staff was good, but the food was a miss. Not bad, but not as good as it should have been. Seems they're trying to figure out who they are as a restaurant outside of breakfast... hope they figure it out.",

My expectations were high after reading all the reviews online, but we did not seem to have a great food experience.  The BEC (Bacon, Egg and Cheese Biscuit) I ordered was decent at best - the biscuit was rock hard.  I took the top off and ate the bacon, egg and cheese open faced, luckily they were all good.    We also ordered the California French Toast (orange flavored french toast).  The only orange flavor was the mandarin oranges in my fruit cup.  The cranberry orange butter was good, and the toast was cooked very well - thick toast, a little overcooked, but there just wasn't much flavor.    We also had the Breakfast Casserole which was good.  The menu said it had a pastry bottom, but the bottom of ours was just the eggs, no pastry bottom.    Great service.  Maybe we just came too late or on a bad day, but the food was just not that impressive.

Love the hash browns, their fruit platter comes with raspberries/kiwi/blackberries (YUM), the Bloody Mary's have real bacon, their Red Velvet Waffle is a-may-zing, the Steak & Eggs is darn good, their Croque Madame is noble, the S'mores French Toast is yummy, the Banana Pecan French Toast is freaking awesome, and next on my list to try are the Quiche or an Omelet but I haven't been able to stay away from my tried and True faves.  This place is delish; my only regret is that I haven't been for lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "I lived upstairs from Terrace Cafe in corporate housing for my first couple months in Charlotte. Since we were still settling down, we got take-out from Terrace Cafe a LOT. Here's how it went: Look for menu online.  Call in order.  Walk downstairs.  Get food.  NOSH.   Here are some of my faves:   -- NC Trout with tempura green beans (DROOL!  Fast food places should replace fries with tempura green beans!) in a pineapple soy burre blanc.  The trout is super flaky and fresh, and the burre blanc so sinfully rich, it could make a cardboard box taste good!  -- Pork Tenderloin with black eyed pea succotash and jalapeno jam.  Tender and well seasoned, and the succotash and jam give it a nice sweetness.   -- Vegetable Plate.  I know, sounds sissy, but it's delicious.  A potato side, a side of tempura green beans (see, there they are again!) baby carrots (with the little green stems attached, nice touch) and asparagus.  Trust me, you won't miss the meat.   -- Bibb Salad:  my favorite starter here.  Mandarin oranges, pears, Crasins and the kicker... fried goat cheese!  Add fried goat cheese to...oh yeah, that cardboard box, and again, a delicious dish.   -- Fried Green Tomatoes: served with pimento cheese.  \"Nuff said.   The reason why I don't give TC 5 stars, is I had some just OK experiences for breakfast and lunch.  (Please, don't hurt me, Terrace Cafe diehards!) The famed red velvet waffle and banana pecan french toast were just too sweet.  I'm going to get a CAVITY sweet.   The lunch I ordered was a vegetable soup with olives...and the turkey sandwich was just that.  A boring turkey sandwich.  (Olives I think is one of those foods either you like or don't like, and it should be indicated on the menu or by the server if something has olives or not.)   The service is always friendly and pretty on-point.  The ambiance too is inviting and warm-- both levels.    Don't forget to check out their deals-- like buy-one-dinner-get-the-second 50% off certain days of the week!",

    "text": "I met up with a group of friends for dinner at Terrace Cafe to celebrate our friend's birthday a couple of weeks ago. It's hidden in a little niche around the corner from the Harris Express Y, and parking can be a bit difficult depending on the time you arrive. After finding a space and walking into the restaurant, I immediately decompressed. The ambiance was very inviting and our server was wonderful. I've heard great things about the breakfast food at Terrace Cafe, but never anything about dinner. Here are my thoughts:  1. 3/5 stars for the fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese. Might be because we are recently back from Charleston where we had such wonderful pimento cheese and fried green tomatoes everywhere we went, but this order seemed a bit bland.   2. 5/5 stars for the biscuits with the butter and delicious jalapeno jelly. Couldn't get enough of these bite sized nuggets.  3. 4/5 stars for the Fennel Pollen Dusted Red Grouper. It was very tasty but a bit soupier than I thought it would be. The serving size was quite large, so I had the remaining for lunch the next day.  4. 5/5 for all the desserts (we each ordered one so had 4 of the 5 options). The serving portions are individually sized, which is great if you just want a little sweet treat without blowing your entire daily caloric budget. You can't go wrong with a dessert at Terrace Cafe!  Last but not least, on Thursday nights they have $5 martinis, which is a great deal in Southpark. All in all, Terrace Cafe is a solid experience for dinner and I'll go back soon, probably for the raved-about breakfast.",

Yesterday I paid $15 for runny oatmeal and thin little pieces of Turkey bacon. I've had sandwiches, grits, and of course, on my first visit, the doughy overhyped subpar red velvet waffles. I barely ate half of it, along with a runny omelet. I don't know what all the hype is about. The staff isn't even that great. On a positive note, the food usually looks really good.",

    "text": "Terrace Cafe is a neat spot tucked into the base of a mixes use residential/office building offering breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus. The decor is inviting with bar, ground, and upstairs seating options. By all accounts the waitstaff was very helpful and the entire environment was very warm.   We stopped into the Terrace Cafe for breakfast. The menu is varied and it offers a nice selection. We had a couple of omelette's and the shrimp and grits. The omelette's were stuffed to perfection and prepared perfectly. The portions were generous and the house made jam was amazing. Being from Pennsylvania, I have no clue what good grits are or how to prepare grits but these were fantastic. The dish was spicy, and the texture and consistency seemed spot on. The coffee was good and they were quick to refill.   The only slight downfall is price. You are getting quality food so the price for breakfast  is going to be a little more than traditional breakfast spots. If you are like me, and do not mind, check it out. Overall, the Terrace Cafe was a really fantastic breakfast spot and I would love to check it out for other meals.",

Each was a wonderfully memorable experience.    I wanted to comment on my most recent experience during Queen's Feast week. It was simply amazing! My husband ordered the pork chop and it had the most wonderful glaze on it! He also ordered the chicken lollipops. I know my boys will want to order this appetizer when we return. It was very much like wings, but much more meat. It's served with blue cheese dressing, so we'll ask for ranch for them.  I had the fried chicken and being a Southern girl, it was absolutely perfect! The green beans were cooked the way my daddy liked them (very soft) and the garlic mashed potatoes were a treat. I am not used to eating spicy things so the gravy was a little much for me but a nice compliment overall. Chicken was cooked to perfection. I wish I could prepare it so well!  Service was impeccable. Oh, I almost forgot dessert! I chose a peanut butter cheesecake and hubby picked the lemon delicious thing. Wow, I want to go back and eat that lemon thing every day this week!    They did not skimp on portion size unlike some restaurants during the promotional week. We were stuffed and happy to have tried some new items.  The atmosphere is very relaxed but upscale too. You could go in an nice outfit for dinner or stop by in golf clothing for lunch.  We have seen both.   Definitely go to this place. It is a hidden jewel and deserves to be very successful.",

Service was very good but just a tad slow (I can understand that it was very busy). Ordered the fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese as an appetizer. They were good but seemed to have been previously frozen (a couple were cold in the center). Had the southern sausage eggs Benedict. The sausage was excellent. It was served with a biscuit instead of an English muffin, which I love, but the biscuit was kinda tough. Hash browns were very good as well. I was impressed but not over the moon about it like some reviews I had heard. I would definitely give it another try and would even recommend it to others but there is room from some slight improvements.",

We only had about a 25 minute wait -- I was surprised they made us purchase coffee while waiting, and then not offering us refills.... It's the purchasing the coffee, its the not offering free refills, are you kidding me? Rude.   Then the next thing was the noise level -- damn was it loud in there. My mother almost wanted to leave. It was really bad and it ruins your meal when you're straining to listen -- they really need some sound proofing as everything bounces of the ceiling and walls.   Over all the food was just OK -- nothing pretty and nothing spectacular. Mom was happy that they offered REAL \"hash browns\". I had the filet Benedict - never again will I have steak in the morning, it was good, but like I said, ok. They really scrimped on the hollandaise sauce and the eggs were a bit underdone.... Dad had some sort of french toast thing with a side of sausage patties - I tried the sausage patty - it was yummy.   Mother had the bacon, egg, Cheddar breakfast sandwich on a biscut. She said the biscut was good, that the scrambled eggs were dry, and that the bacon had NO flavor - WHAT? Are you freaking killing me... how do you fuck up bacon. What kind of pigs were slaughtered...   So would we go back for breakfast, NO, and that is a FIRM no.   I may go back to try a bloody mary and their steak salad, but not anytime soon.   Sorry Terrace for the coin we shelled out, it just wasn't worth it nor memorable.",

My kids shared and devoured the full breakfast,  which was definitely a full breakfast;  scrambled eggs, bacon,  hash brown and 2 pancakes. And I had the chance to try their Belgian Waffles with fresh fruit which were so delicious, fluffy, fresh, warm and not too sweet. To add to our experience our waitress was very nice and helpful.

    "text": "Wow, I've been busy and I haven't had a chance to do this review like I wanted to.   My boyfriend and I went to Charlotte for a day trip & found this place for a brunch before we hit the road. It was Sunday, therefore we alreeeeady knew it was about to be a wait. What is convenient for this location is that rug parking garage is right next to it. Therefore, if you're with someone, drop them off so they can get a table then park and come back down. For our wait, we did the text message system and I thought that was very savvy. We were told we had to wait 25 minutes. We ended up waiting around 40. It's brunch, what do you expect lol?  I always enjoy looking at the menu prior to me sitting if there's a wait. Like why .. wait to get waited on when you were already waiting. This location had a menu on the outside of the building which helped speed the process up.   As we were waiting I saw that this restaurant had won awards. So in my mind, their bar just raised. When you walk in there was a bar where you can order your fun drinks and pick up your togo orders.   I feel like one of my favorite parts of the restaurant was how we got to sit upstairs. We got to look over the. .. wait for for it. .. TERRACE LOLLLL.   Our waiters name was Brandon. He was pretty cool. While ordering, he actually made me excited for the food. We waited, not very long actually. I ordered banana pecan french toast with a side of hash browns. YES CARBS.   The toast came but I had to wait almost 10 minutes for my hash browns. I was a little disappointed. Why? Because I like eating everything I ordered at ONCE... and well. . I like taking photos of my food & it was missing lol. When I got the hash browns I was little. .. ehh idk. It didn't have annnny type of seasoning. They were bland. The french toast was a yes and my boyfriend didn't have any complaints about his food.   So it's time for us to leave & we needed to use the restrooms. If you have read any of my previous reviews, bathrooms are a big deal for me. To me, they are a reflection on the cleanliness of your kitchen area. An example, yes the kitchen can get chaotic, however for safety concerns, they need to be managed to make sure that the health and safety is kept up. . whaaaaale. . the bathrooms at this location weren't \"everything\".  There was barely any tissue and it was \"placed\" on top of the roller when clearly, you could just place it. .. alright anyway. Stuff was all over the floor, etc. I understand that yes it's brunch, yes it's a weekend, yes it's busy. . however there needs to be someone checking it more often when the traffic is higher in the restaurant.   Overall rating: 3.5.   Pros:  - service, GO Brandon  - atmosphere  - quality of food   Cons: - bathrooms  - prices for side items  - no seasoning on the hash browns - food was \"forgotten\" and had to wait.   I know for a fact that when in the area again, we will be back.",

We sat upstairs and you could see right into the galley, see dirty carpets, and an air conditioner or something on the ceiling in great disrepair.",

He recommended the Bavarian French toast (which I would have honestly paid more than $12.50 for they were THAT good) and got my husband the red velvet waffle to-go which is just as delicious!! This was my second time at Terrace Cafe, and both times I've been in here it's been absolutely perfect all around. I 100% recommend coming here for brunch/breakfast any day of the week!!!",

The upstairs servers were looking at a video on our server's cell phone, joking around in the kitchen area by the stairs. Our water was never refilled. Coffee was refilled once (it was also cold) by the team leader (I think since she had an earpiece).  We saw our server at our table three times: when she took our drink order, when she gave our drinks and got our food order, and when she finally gave our check. I think we could have just walked out and not pay and no one would notice.    Thinking back to my food, I didn't realize my order was incomplete. I ordered the Southern style Benedict with the optional sausage gravy. The gravy was missing.",

I got the skillet with thin slice steak, pepper jack cheese, potatoes, onions, peppers and topped with two eggs of your choosing. On the side I got a homemade biscuit with their homemade jelly, am amazing. It is up there with Pop eyes biscuits because those are my absolute favorite.  Laura was our waitress.

Unfortunately after you wait an hour you have higher expectations (as in, I waited an hour this better be Frikkin awesome)...and it wasn't. My choc chip pancakes were great but I wasn't a fan of the chicken apple sausage (it was burnt & didn't taste like breakfast sausage). Our friends weren't impressed with their eggs Benedict.

Table not cleaned well, server was less than welcoming, had to ask for silverware after food was served. Quality of food has declined sharply. Same tempting recipes in a nice atmosphere but my food was so heavy on the cooking grease (Chef's daily special Hash) that's really all I tasted, daughters poppyseed French toast was burnt on one side, sons eggs were cold; asked for over easy on 2 eggs, 1 yoke was broken and cooked hard and other yoke was in tacked but pretty much hard too. Regular coffee was barely warm, and cup came with lipstick stain from previous user. Second cup of coffee I ordered, decaf this time, was same low temp. The bill was a steep $125.00 for 6 of us and honestly IHOP would of (& has) done a better job for much less  $$.  I won't be back.",

The mimosas and bellinis are on point and the fried green tomatoes are perfect. My absolute favorite is the red waffle and chicken. It's not too sweat and the flavors come together nicely.",

I think I might throw a tent up and stay here for a while and try all their items for the next several days. I ordered the banana/pecan waffles. They were amazing! They were perfectly prepared, fluffy, not doughey, flavorful and not too sweet - definitely gourmet. The menu is diverse with options to satisfy even the pickiest eater. Service was prompt and courteous. Cafe Au Lait was perfect. Can't say enough about this restaurant. We will come here every time we visit Charlotte!",

Pancakes were DELICIOUS, the food was great, & our waitress was very friendly. The manager went around to each table as well to make sure everything was ok. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was since there was a wait people were piling up in the front right by the door. I'm sure people would have waited outside had it been warmer but a little area for waiting may have been more accommodating. Pagers would also be a suggestion so you can wait in your car if you wanted. Although it got crowded we were seated in no time.",

I wish I had taken a picture of it but I was embarrassed because it was a small party of six... A wedding brunch. The berry martini was good.

They have a Diablo (extra spicy), bacon Bloody and regular Bloody. I always get the bacon Bloody with a little extra spice. The latte's are also tasty and come in flavors ranging from blueberry to peanut butter. Can't speak on the blueberry, but peanut butter is phenomenal.  Unfortunately, they removed the s'mores french toast from the menu last year, which was my favorite, but they still have the famed red velvet waffle. Yes, you can also add fried chicken. Yes, it is as good as it sounds.  Grits are fluffy and creamy. Hashbrowns are shredded and deep fried - probably not made in house but still pretty good.   The biscuits and gravy and bacon, sausage and cheese sandwiches are delicious as well.  Go here. Seriously.",

My favorite thing to order is the red velvet waffle - everyone should try it at least once (AT LEAST!!). I wasn't as impressed with the Banana Pecan French Toast, which was drowned in maple syrup to the point of being as soft as apple sauce. Nonetheless, at least the flavor was still good. I've also tried a latte here before (I forgot the flavor), which was tasty and had cool latte art.  I read a lot of review with complaints about long lines, but each time I've been I've gotten a seat immediately. I went on weekdays both times and the first time I went was after 1pm while the second time was after 7pm.",

Apparently everyone else has heard a lot about it because there was a 30 min wait. In fact they stayed on a wait during the entire time we were there. That's always a good sign.  We were seated at 11:30 and our waiter was right there to take care of us. We both got caramel lattes. I was impressed by their amazing coffee selection/espresso bar. It's not often that you find that in a restaurant. The coffee was delicious and came complete with some foam designs.  I got the eggs Benedict and it was delicious. I also got a side of the fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese. They were awesome!! My friend got the full breakfast and she enjoyed it. Service was excellent from beginning to end.

I got a red velvet waffle that my son's devoured for me I ended up ordering another so I could try it. My son is picky so The fact that he ate it so fast had me curious and it was worth it !

Yeah, I went there for the Red Velvet Waffles w/ cream cheese drizzled on top because it sound intriguing but that wasn't the highligh of my experience.    When we walked into this beautiful establishment, I loved the soft and easy low-key tones of the restaurant.  I felt like we were in a movie.  Although it was packed, the ambiance was very relaxing and comforting.  The star of the show for me was definitely the chicken apple sausage (which is made fresh at the restaurant).  It is so delicious that I am still at a loss for words!  It is definitely something that you'd have to try for yourself.  So let me back up a bit,  I ordered the red velvet waffles, chicken apple sausage, and stone ground grits w/ cheese.   Lately, I have to admit, I have not liked anyone's grits besides my own, but let me tell you...if you're craving grits and you don't want to make them yourself--give this place a try.  I personally cannot wait to go back and try other things on the menu.",

    "text": "After reading the positive review  for Terrace Cafe in Charlotte Magazine, my hubby and I knew we had to try them for breakfast.  And not only are really glad we did, we expect to return often (even though it's a bit of hike for us)!    Just be forewarned that you should expect a wait. Terrace Cafe is totally worth the wait, though. They are also very efficient, so our expected 30-minute wait for a table on a Sunday turned into just 20 minutes.  To start, they have a full espresso bar with options that few other restaurants have -- like the white chocolate blackberry mousse latte that my husband got, or the pumpkin spice latte that I got. Both were yummy, but the pumpkin was a tad sweeter than my hubby's white chocolate blackberry.    For the meal, I got the red velvet waffle with cream cheese topping and fruit. I loved the fact that the fruit was served room temperature and not ice cold, like I usually get it. The fruit was also a nice selection of blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, pineapple, melon, and kiwi. The waffle was a perfect-sized portion but could have used a bit more cream cheese topping. (I like my toppings sweet!) I'll probably ask for an extra bit the next time.    My hubby got the full breakfast with two fried eggs, bacon, hash browns, and chocolate chip pancakes. The choco pancakes were light and delicious and probably my favorite thing out of everything we got.  I also loved that they served the syrup heated. What a nice touch! We were both really impressed by the entire meal. (And did I already say the coffee was yummy? I swear, bad coffee can absolutely destroy a good meal!)  Service was really quick, and we did not have to wait long for the meal to arrive. Our server was also extremely attentive and checked back with us several times to make sure we were happy. We really appreciated that.  It's great that Terrace Cafe is open for breakfast on both Saturdays and Sundays.  So few places in Charlotte offer breakfast on Saturdays!  They have the winning combination of great coffee, delicious food, and quick and attentive service...we'll definitely be back!",

I'm not sure if it's still on their regular menu, but it was delicious. The sides were good too!  Our server was very friendly and the food came out pretty quickly. From what I remember, the dining room could use a little reno, but it wasn't too bad. It wouldn't deter me from coming back.   I've heard that brunch is awesome here. We've been meaning to give it a try.   But from what I did experience at Terrace Cafe on our first visit, I would definitely like to return.",

You will have to see them prepare all the food through the window to the kitchen, which for me takes the fun out of it, but it definitely doesn't take away from the taste.

We needed breakfast recovery. So to Terrace Cafe we went.  The notorious \"wait\" ensued. We weren't the only hungover ones, and as the rain drizzled, we recanted the night before, before being seated 30 mins later.  We spotted about 6 open tables as we're led in, we wondered why we weren't seated earlier.  Ordered foamy cappuccinos, and fresh squeezed OJ. Started feeling the road to recovery.  The menu looked great. We wanted to order everything. But I stuck to something I've missed, poached eggs. We ordered:      Eggs Florentine.     Full breakfast, and     the Cajun Shrimp Omelet.  My eggs were perfectly poached, which made me happy. The Hollandaise sauce actually tasted like Hollandaise sauce. My English muffin however was a tad over fried and hard. Oh well. Overall tasty. Good salad. Good hash.  My friends dug their meals. The Cajun Shrimp was a bit too pungent of a thing to eat hungover (eggs and fishyness...) but seemed OK. Bit over the top onion-y.  Finished. Service was just OK.  Bit pricey, but the best hangover cure. Will come here again.

    "text": "Phenomenal breakfast. The Terrace Cafe is a must go there culinary gem. Wonderful, satisfying, and unique breakfast fare. A red velvet waffle topped with a light cream cheese drizzle was placed in front of me with a perfectly cooked piece of boneless fried chicken. The waffle was magical; not too heavy and not over-the-top sweet. It was decadent. The chicken came out piping hot and was cooked perfectly; moist and encapsulated in a light and crunchy breading; the kind of breading that inspires you to pick the remnants up off the plate with the pads of your fingers. The chicken was so delicious, I ordered a fried chicken eggs benedict. The same amazing chicken with two perfectly poached eggs; not to runny, not too hard. And the hollandaise sauce was rich and light all at once and didn't over-power the eggs.  The staff here is amazing. They have incredible coffee that was served to us by a coffee genius named Ben. The heart atop my cappuccino stayed until I finished it.  Our waiter Chris was fantastic and friendly and very patient with my food indecisiveness. Patrick the chef as incredible. It's obvious the staff here care about their product and their service. I can't say enough about the wonderful experience my husband and I had here. Counter area seating is first come first serve but if you do encounter a line, you must wait. It will be worth it.  There are not enough stars to give. We will definitely return.",

We had really bad service - the waiter brought about 1 oz of cream for 4 people to have in coffee. It's still ok to put cream in coffee, isn't it? Anyone?? After the rough start, it got worse.  Forgotten drinks, cold food and I don't know what the other reviewers see in the grits.  Homemade sausage was flavorless.  Better choice for sausage biscuits and gravy:  Zada Janes in Plaza Midwood. Better choice for cheese grits:  Boudreaux's in NoDa (Sunday brunch.  YUM.)    To their credit, the manager of this place did the right thing when we brought our bad experience to his attention so I feel a little bad about posting this review. But the food, service and atmosphere just didn't live up to the reviews.",

We you first walk in, you see a bar, some seating on ground level, and then an exposed upstairs which is where we sat.  This place just feels new and clean, while still having some charm to it.       The food here is awesome.  I had the red velvet waffle and the lady had the eggs benedict  The egg was poached nicely, but the red velvte waffle reigned supreme. I honestly wanted to lather my body with the cream cheese drizzle, though I don't know what unwanted person I may attract.      The food, mimosas, and the service were great.  I aso distinctly remember the odd shaped glasses for some reason. The only thing that put me off a little bit is the price.  It was a bit higher for brunch, but you do get what you pay for.

It came with cheese grits on the side. This dish was absolutely delicious. I even enjoyed the grits (I'm a bit skeptical of other states' grits). My friend ordered the red velvet waffles with hash browns as her side item. It was like eating Coke for breakfast! Sooooo good! The hash browns were on point as well!

Way more than a normal person could/should eat in one sitting. But, maybe a good idea to share. Or perhaps they offer a half size if you request it? I think I will try that next time. It is absolutely delicious by the way, especially if you are a french toast addict like myself. I am always going to restaurants and trying whatever unique french toast offering they have come up with. This one certainly did not disappoint.

    "text": "Heard of this place plenty of times, didn't really know what to expect.  Since we're trying to avoid mad traffic in the Dilworth area due to Greek Festival, my friend and I headed to Piedmont Row for brunch instead.  Granted I didn't have expectations, I guess I'm just one of those people who aren't easily impressed.    Decor/atmosphere: simple, cafe-like, bright and appealing, causal dressy if that's such a thing... nice high ceiling showcasing the upper level seating... feel bad for food runners who have to climb those stairs   Menu: extensive breakfast/lunch options, maybe a little too extensive because it was hard to make a decision.  Most items are low to mid $10s during breakfast/brunch/lunch time  Food: I'm a soup freak... can't pass on a blue crab bisque.  It was creamy, lumps of yummy fresh crab meat, and OMG salty!  That's an achievement of its kind for me to think something is high sodium (maybe not a good kind of achievement).  Finished it still... but really could have held back the salt.  I ordered the Fried Oysters Spinach Salad... the thing is HUGE.  I swear there's a pound of spinach in that bowl.  Tons of oysters.  Impressive looking.  But unfortunately they went too heavy handed on the vinaigrette.  The menu said hot bacon vinaigrette.  As much as you and I know, it's easy to taste bacon.  Somehow they managed to cover up all things bacon, caramelized onions & sauteed mushrooms... the main reasons I ordered the salad besides the oysters.  The oysters didn't disappoint...  but not enough to save the dish.  For $12.50, it's a big portion, but I can't say the taste justify for it.  Service:Ok.  Little slow on the water refill.  Coffee was amazing though.  Reminded me of Italy.   In conclusion, I was little disappointed by the food.  I know they're known for their red velvet waffle... but I should be able to order something else that isn't sweet and still be yummy.  The menu is a little pricey for \"cafe\" (especially for dinner).  Another good looking place in Charlotte that didn't deliver in the food department.",

Despite how busy the place was there was kind of a calm ambiance, which my hubs attributed to strategic not-so-bright lighting and color scheme.  It feels like a nice place.  The sanitation rating inspired confidence too. I got a strawberry waffle with sausage, he got the quiche of the day (ham, cheese, broc and tomato).  My waffle was tasty, but then again, most waffles are.  The sausage patties had a little zing to them.  Hubs' quiche was promising but seemed to have been sitting for a little too long.  He said my quiches are better - to which you might say, of course he did, but he's more the type to say \"hon, you've got to learn how to make this\" if that is more True to the situation.  They had other items that looked interesting - crab benedict, for example, and some of their breakfast sandwiches - but between us we were neither wowed nor wigged out. The place is neither a deal nor highway robbery.  Overall it's kind of average.",

    "text": "I had a 5 hour layover in Charlotte last week so a friend picked my husband and me up at the airport for a nice breakfast. Hence how we ended up at the Terrace Cafe. What a treat that ended up turning into.  I had the sausage gravy over biscuits. I'm a big fan of Bob Evans S&B but don't live near one now so I'm always looking to top the deliciousness of those. The Terrace Cafe exceeded my expectations. The biscuits where light and fluffy and the sausage (made fresh in their kitchen) was tasty but not greasy. The perfect blend of flavors in a light creamy gravy. It came with a side salad which I thought was a bit weird for breakfast and then regretted that I didn't eat it since later my husband and our friend told me it was really good with a light dressing that was actually complementary to the meal (so what do I know?).  Our friend had the eggs benedict which he raved about and my husband had the full breakfast which included eggs, bacon and pancakes. Being quite the connoisseur on pancakes my husband raved about them.  The only complaint I had was that I thought they must have been packing meat in their dining room because it was FREEZING in there. When I asked the waiter about it he told me that apparently it gets so warm in the afternoon that they have to keep it cool in the morning. That's great for the afternoon diners but why should I have to be uncomfortable to accommodate later diners? We were all uncomfortably cold and left as soon as we were finished eating which was too made because we would have liked to hang out a bit have more coffee and visit. My husband even said that by the time he got to the end of his meal it wasn't warm any longer. Now THAT'S cold.  Overall though the food was wonderful and I'd definitely recommend it. You may however want to try it in the afternoon!",

Last week, the wait on a Sunday morning was almost 45 minutes but once we were seated our server was incredibly prompt and attentive. I was most impressed when my 2 year old ordered a hot chocolate and they brought her a mildly tepid version - kudos for that! The kids menu is simple and priced right - $5. They added chocolate chips to the kids pancakes for$.50. The kids' meals all came with a huge dish of beautiful fruit. My husband ordered an omelet special and it was fantastic. I ordered the banana pecan French toast and it really was too sweet for my taste.  Today we had no wait but the service was slightly less fantastic. My husband was served coffee with no cream or sugar and our salt shaker was empty. Our food was excellent but I was ready to bus my own table at the end because my kids were so antsy and the check was nowhere in sight. My husband finally had to give in and just take the kids out while I waited for the check. Still our fave breakfast place - will probably be back soon!",

It is a bit ironic that a place called the Terrace Cafe doesn't have any outdoor seating, but my understanding is that the other location does? We waited about 20 minutes for a table and were seated upstairs. Our waitress was very friendly and personable (Julie, I think.) I had the salted caramel latte, which was delicious, as well as the biscuit and gravy with fruit salad. They make the sausage in house, and it was very good. The dish comes with one large biscuit, smothered in their cream sausage gravy. I was a happy camper. My one complaint was that the fruit salad was a little bit warm - I would have preferred it cold and fresh out of the fridge. I'm sure we'll return for brunch, but I'd also like to try some of their lunch and dinner offerings -",

    "text": "So, I was down in Charlotte for a couple days for a wedding.  The hotel I was staying at had an overpriced, lackluster breakfast buffet, so I decided to venture out to find food elsewhere.  After reading the reviews here on Yelp, I headed to The Terrace Cafe.  Normally when I'm in a strange town, I never eat at the same place twice as I want to try as much of the local scene as possible.  But after going to the Terrace Cafe on the first day, I decided to break this rule and head back on the second day.  On the first day, my wife and I were quickly seated.  She ordered the SEC breakfast sandwich, and I ordered the Belgian malted waffles.  Seth, the waiter, said to me \"Do you like bacon?\"  Which I replied \"I'm a guy.  Of course I like bacon.\"  He then told me that I should try the bacon waffle.  I decided to give a shot.  Now, Seth made it sound like the Bacon Waffle was better than sex.  Poor guy looked so disappointed when I told him it was \"pretty good\" (That really is a very high compliment from me.)  So, Bacon Waffle not better than sex, but definitely amongst the top breakfast's out there.  Wife enjoyed her SEC as well.    The next day, more relatives arrived for the wedding and we decided to head back to Terrace Cafe, but this time with a group of 8.    Again, we were sat very quickly, and Seth even remembered the wife and I from the day before.  I went with the more traditional Eggs Benedict, and Wife had an omelet.  The eggs benedict were the best I've had in quite some time (It's amazing how the hollandaise sauce can vary so much from restaurant to restaurant.)  Wife thoroughly enjoyed her omelet.  Now, as if the main breakfast entrees aren't enough to get you to come to Terrace Cafe, Then consider their sides.  I had their hash browns both days.  Pure fried shredded potato goodness.  Wife had the fruit cup, which she said is the best fruit she's ever had at a restaurant as it included some more exotic fruits.    I wish we had one more day in Charlotte as I really wanted to try the red velvet waffle.  Someone at the table next to us on the first day had it as a breakfast desert (seriously, they both had eggs benedict, which is quite filling, then split a red velvet waffle afterwards.)  I recommend this place for anyone in the Charlotte area.  It's traditional southern breakfast with a modern twist.",

    "text": "Recently, I was asked to head over to Terrace Cafe and I must say that I was reluctant to do so.  I usually avoid cafes, especially new and modern ones, as I always feel that I am not part of their target demographic.  Atmosphere - Bright, Clean, Open, IKEA-ish, Funky Drink Glasses (that I have seen before...I know I have) and Fake Wood menus (not sure where that comes from)?  Food - While their menu has an extensive breakfast listing, I opted for lunch...a healthy one...and an apparently charitable one.  I ordered the Fruit Salad w/ chicken, one of the two YMCA nutritionist approved items (look for the black and red \"Y\") with a portion of the sale going to the YMCA.  This way I ate healthy and felt good about myself...wow, I am a great person!  This salad is very similar to the one I enjoy at the now Chapter 11-filed Max & Erma's.  This salad, like M&E's consists of mixed greens, grilled chicken, pecans, blue cheese, apples, and grapes, which is then topped with some red (or pink) raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  As the norm for me, I asked for the dressing on the side...it is healthier...wow, I am smart too.  The chicken was just okay as it tasted like they wiped the \"black char\" off the grill with it.  I mean it had the grill marks that I expected but it was also pretty much smeared with black grill soot (I doubt that the nutritionist approved that!).  The portion size of the salad was fine to a little on the skimpy side.  The dressing, while it was pink (see second sentence in this review), was all right and not too sweet.  Overall, it was a decent salad for lunch.   Service - Hmmm...okay the place was busy and it was lunchtime...the order was received as placed...water filled once...it was...15% tip type service.  Price - Salad $11.  For the quantity of the grilled chicken given in the salad...go to Max & Erma's.  Then again, maybe that is why they are going broke.  Overall - The menu did have several other items listed that seemed interesting.  Okay, would I go here again... maybe...maybe with a date...like a lunch date?  Now, I must go drink a beer and work on my car or something manly...pink dressing...um, what???",

I had the Buffalo Chicken sandwich it was ok nothing that really stood out to be bad but not that good either.  I forget what my boss ordered I know it was a special, but he didn't care for it. My sister had the Quiche it was ice cold and then had to sit there with nothing to eat because the server wasn't around...when he did come over he ran to the kitchen to get it fixed she said it was of course much better!!   Now the real reason this place is getting 3 stars is because of the S'mores French Toast that we decided to have for dessert!!! OMG this was ridiculously good!! I highly recommend it not for your entree but to share with others as a dessert because it is huge and sweet!!",

And if your servers are miserable, that means your management is miserable. And if your management is miserable, than I certainly don't want to add to the funds of an owner that makes people miserable.

It took at least ten minutes for someone to actually come over and say anything to me. I had to yell to someone over the noise \"can I get a menu?\" Finally when the girl said she was coming to wipe down the area where I was sitting, she never came back so when I saw her again I had to ask if she was going to wipe it down. She said \"we're super busy I'm so sorry I'll get to it as soon as I can.\" She finally came back five minutes later wiped it down and finally asked what I wanted, 15 minutes after I'd arrived. Then some woman, who is barely dressed, halter top, skin showing, boobs out, THE WORKS, comes in, sits at the bar, takes off her expensive sunglasses and places her expensive purse down, and all the staff behind the bar come rushing to her asking what she needs, does she want water, how's she doing. Its funny because even with all her expensive possessions, she was asking \"well how much if I do this or that?\" If you can afford those expensive glasses but can't buy some eggs, get your priorities in order. All I can do is look like \"well perhaps next time I'll show a little more skin and flash a flirty smile so people will wait on me hand and foot.\" It's amazing what people will do when they \"think\" customers have money. This is crazy. I thought I left crap like that in Atlanta but I guess it's all the same in Charlotte. (ps chick took a pic of her food to post on Soc media when it came, wow. Real classy) Thanks for the omelette tho, Terrace Cafe. -Sincerely, Frustrated ISU Doc Student on a writing break looking for good food and service",

    "text": "11/15/10  Terrace Cafe was a place I'd bookmarked weeks before my sister had mentioned hearing about its red velvet waffle from a coworker.  It sounded so delicious to her, she couldn't wait for us to try it!  Thank goodness her GPS system was cooperating that morning-- we found the parking garage easily.  Reaching the cafe proved a little bit tougher, even when I stopped to ask a security guard.  Or maybe we were just a little past the point of starving??  I really liked the entrance of the cafe, which had a nice-looking deli case full of specialty juices, pre-made salads, and dessert.  I really liked the energy here and was hoping we'd be able to sit at one of the two empty tables, but we were relegated to the back of the restaurant, where the energy was significantly muted (quite sleepy, actually), and the atmosphere there (from the large and dull wall paintings and dim lighting) made me think we were dining at a generic hotel chain restaurant after the buffet rush.  Service was very slow, as well, which I thought was odd, given that there was only one other occupied table besides ours.  After much deliberation as to what to order, we decided on the Red velvet waffle ($10), the California French toast ($10), a side of bacon ($3.50), and a side of two eggs, scrambled ($2.50).  We also ordered coffee for the table.  Mom and sister enjoyed their scrambled eggs, and we all liked the hash browns, extra-crispy on the outside by request, that I chose to accompany the waffle (options also included grits and fruit).  The bacon slices were thick-cut, wonderfully-crisped, and flavorful-- well-worth the $3.50 price tag.  Mom and I found the coffee to be very weak... Funny that sis and I were drawn to this place w/ the promise of earth-shattering delicious red velvet waffle, which she found to be boring, and I to be too fluffy and lacking of rich, chocolatey goodness, w/ its cream cheese drizzle proving to be too sweet to flip over this flop of a breakfast treat!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg?select=pwFY3czNmSCDkWIv9fK57g#pwFY3czNmSCDkWIv9fK57g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bzbN...</a>  BUT there was a light at the end of the tunnel, and it was the California French toast!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bzbNGyrTwWHAgg1CqkSgeg?select=_EKfF3-pgKDfq7Zup4NEdg#_EKfF3-pgKDfq7Zup4NEdg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/bzbN...</a>  This beauty of a dish consisted of three large slices of orange-scented French toast, which were drizzled w/ orange-infused honey and a side of wonderful cranberry butter!  I wished I'd ordered this, instead!  I wished I'd ordered anything other than that silly waffle!  But I digress... Really, the French toast is not to be missed.  I would, however, request for a crispier crust, should we ever return.",

I am rather discerning about my desserts and red velvet is my favorite however I rarely find a really good red velvet anything. With that said, the red velvet waffles were amazing.  Light and fluffy; kinda opposite of how a red velvet cake or cupcake is but it works.  It is flavorful and the cream cheese icing is as light and perfect.  I am extremely impressed.    The shrimp and grits was delicious and savory.  I only had a bite but will definitely order it on another occasion.    I may not be a connoisseur of fried green tomatoes since I am not a Southerner and thought these were alright. I probably wouldn't order them again.  If you are in the Queen City, definitely make the time to come to the Terrace Cafe! A must stop on your culinary path.",

When our food finally arrived it was cold and we were missing hash browns. Jennifer said they would be right out however they never came. after 25 mins I asked for the manager and he brought them back in two mins. The manager even said \"that is the easiest dish to get\" After all that we were informed that the credit card machine was down so we waited an additional 20 minutes. This place is overpriced for the poor quality and service. Save your money.",

All the staff were super friendly and accommodating. I really like how the menu has some funny, quirky items, like the red velvet waffle (what I had and holey-moley was it awesome!), the banana split yogurt parfait, and a chocolate covered cherry latte. The food was very good and service great. When I told my server I thought the latte was not flavored enough, she took it back and added more syrup.  There was a lot of seating, but I could see why this place might get packed with people at peak times. I will be going back here again the next time I am in Charlotte for sure!",

The waitress/waiter has taken an unbelievably long time to even take our drink order and most recently, a simple water and coffee order was botched.

It was surprisingly soft & spongy, while tender at the same time. The flavors were perfect. I had shrimp & grits & the flavors there were great as well- kind of remenecent of fajitas. While I loved the shrimp & grits I do think they were in need of a texture variant. It a BIG bowl of soft, kind of mushiness... i didn't think the shrimp & okra alone provided enough texture. A friend offered me her toast & I thought that worked great with the grits (they should consider always serving it with toast) Mimosas- while I wouldn't say they're worth the $8, I still thought they were nice. The poppy seed French toast- while I loved the flavors of that, I found the poppy seed in the toast I could've done without. Service was great, bathrooms were small but nice & clean. Overall, I loved it & will definitely return soon.",

The hostess is unfriendly and cannot quote a wait time properly, the waiters have no sense of urgency and all seem unhappy and other employees seem miserable too. I ordered a fruit platter which was missing coffee cake and half the fruit, our French press only filled half of each coffee cup and we were charged full price for both of these items... we didn't want to ask for anything extra because it was so busy!! Previously we had dined here and service was exceptional along with food quality but they have taken an unfortunate turn for the worse. Despite the great food and dining here more than ten times we will not be returning.",

Didnt get the full French Toast  you get 2 for $11 to add eggs is $4 to add cheese is  $1  .. it was all cold.. kitchen at the door,,,, plates at the window ppl sitting waiting to eat waitresses talking and not helping each other push food out to customers is why my food was cold! They are a great business and Food is A++++++ but it was cold because they were not helping to push the Food out to customers\"  Experience",

On top of the waffle, they add white chocolate sauce and strawberry. Overall, it's pretty tasty. It's probably my fav thing here this far.   Grits is pretty blend. There's not enough seasoning on it. I may ask to upgrade to cheesy grits next time.  Biscuit and gravy: the biscuit is crispier than I would like. It's not those soft and fluffy kind. The gravy is pretty good. It has real chuck of ground beef not bitty tiny piece of ground beef which I can appreciate.   Customer service: the wait time is about 30 mins when we got here this morning. They promptly let us know when the table is ready. Our waitress is really attentive. The food came out in 10 mins. We are pretty happy with the service.   Location: The place is easy to find and free parking is right next to the building.",

The waffle is soft and sweet but not overly so, and just thinking about the melted cream cheese atop makes me salivate. The eggs Benedict florentine was also incredible, with an excellent balance of salty mustard with crispy fried onions and tomato and perfectly poached eggs that broke beautifully before oozing into the warm English muffin.  Pro-tip: if you just order the waffle without the sides, it's $8. Perfect for sharing ;)  Terrace Cafe doesn't take brunch reservations, but our party of 4 arrived on a Saturday at 11am.

After about 5-7 minutes we were sat and greeted by our server, Julie. It seemed as though Ms. Julie was a little overwhelmed by being sat multiple times in a row, but she still provided decent service. Our food came out in a little over 10 minutes. We ordered a Full Breakfast with grits, bacon, scrambled eggs and a Belgium waffle( substituted for two pancakes). As well as the Lemon Poppyseed French Toast with a side of cheesy stone grits and bacon.   Both meals were served piping hot and were very delicious!   I must say we enjoyed almost everything from the food to the restaurants classy, but relaxed atmosphere! We'll definitely be back!!",

Chicken was two small tenders and not enough meat to be satisfied. I couldn't eat the hash browns, it smell weird and were under cooked. The waffle was tasteless and a bust.  The food  was a big disappointment and definitely not worth paying $18.00! It looked much better than it tasted.  Dont waste your time coming here. It is located in a nice area, but the cafe is very small with limited seating and looks outdated for the area.   Go somewhere else if your craving chicken and waffles. There was another location in Charlotte that sells it for $5.00-$7.00 with great reviews. If you choose to go here and feel disappointed after. You can only blame yourself, you was warned",

I ate it all. Didn't like my hash browns though. Tasteless. Everything else was delicious. It was 29 for both of our meals. Not bad. Def worth it. Everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked great. Def will go back. Parked across the street at ENT office(so not sure about the parking). Came after an appointment. No wait.

During today's breakfast visit, the fella and I sat at the bar. Our server was kind of arrogant and yet didn't know what was in the Berry Split I ordered (my usual). Thankfully, another server overheard him and corrected him. It also took him forever to bring our check, and we finally had to stop him and ask for it since he was too busy talking to the other 3 guys behind the bar.  When I got the Berry Split, it was literally half the size it used to be. There was one, small dollop of yogurt and maybe one banana split in half. Sprinkle on a tiny bit of granola and fruit, and that was it. However, they certainly didn't lower the price; it was still $11! The fella ordered a small OJ, which was $3.50 and maybe 8 ounces. Yikes. His benedict and grits were fine, but there just wasn't anything stellar on this visit or our last few. Pretty disappointing since this used to be my hands-down favorite breakfast in town.",

After seating, the waitress was prompt in getting us water and drinks ordered in and even after a change in servers we were able to get our orders in. The food for the most part was delicious, but the vegan chicken was not well received by my sister in-law. However everything else was amazing and it is a highly recommended brunch spot for anyone who enjoy good meals and won't break the bank.",

Their menu was large with a lot of options. I got the eggs Benedict and fruit. The fruit was blah and it tasted old unfortunately, The eggs where good.  The service was super slow almost, I had to go get my own condiments since waitress never came to check after I got my food ( by another person). She checked on me once the entire time, only because I waved for more coffee . Other than that, the place was nice, it had more of a business atmosphere. I wouldn't say it was the best breakfast I ever had, it was ok. But maybe it depends what you eat. Would I eat there again? Prob not .",

They are so professional, food comes out quickly even on their busiest times! They are courteous and the crab cakes Benedict is to die for! Their carrot cake pancakes?!? AHMAZING ! We sat at the bar both times and watched the employees work together and the food come out. Such a great environment, everyone worked so well together and they wore gloves etc. I can't explain how amazing it is. JUST COME AND EAT! Their mimosas are great as well!",

They were very flavorful with a good amount of spice. The grits were creamy and blended great with the gravy. I highly suggest trying them if you are here.   The employees are wonderful here, very friendly and always smiling. The regulars know all their names and tell them stories like they are old friends.   They have a really good coffee bar where people can order to go coffee at the front and the line moves quickly.   A great little find in this cute town so glad I came and might come back tomorrow.",

I have been here multiple times to Grab latte during weekdays but never really had brunch/lunch here until one weekend we decide to go there and realize wait time is way too much given that we were starving ! But this weekend managed to wait for 1hr 10 mins before getting  a table. Good service and good food made it up for this though. Had the \"Benedict-Florentine\" which has fried onions on the top that really adds twist and great flavor. Also tried \"Smothered Chicken\" from Lunch menu. Must mention the orange juice was very fresh and so the cafe au lait was great! Highly recommended..",

    "text": "This is one of my most favorite Charlotte brunch spots! They never fail at providing a especially tasteful meal. I went here Saturday around 1pm with my mom and baby cousin for brunch. I would love to give this place 5 stars but I've been here 3 times and I experience similar issues every time. It seems the kitchen and staff have a hard time handling the volume of service they get because they either mess up your food, forget to bring something out (and you have to keep reminding them) or your food never makes it back out after a mess up. This time they forgot to bring out the baby's (he's 3) Teddy Bear waffle so I had to share my food with him so he didn't go hungry. The waiter came back without the waffle and asked if we were okay (completely forgetting that we never got the teddy bear waffle). She apologized and ran off to get it but by the time she returned my mom and I both had finished out food (the teddy bear waffle was taken off the check).   Despite the mishaps the food is great enough to be patient with the staff. I had a red velvet waffle with chicken on the side which was perfectly seasoned to pair perfectly with the waffle. My mom had the shrimp and grits with was flavorful and interestingly enough came topped with a couple pieces of fried okra. We also had Sunrise Mimosas to compliment our meal because what's brunch without mimosas, right? In the past I have had the lemon poppy seed french toast which is topped with berries, also a great choice to try!  I highly recommend this place for brunch just expect a wait on the weekends and prepare to be patient with the staff.",

The waiter came around when he saw we finished our food. He took away our food and then came back with the check. Hmm..how did he know we didn't want to order something else? He didn't. On the mini bright side, the red velvet waffles were good. Other than that, I would not come back if I were to visit Charlotte again.",

We chose this Piedmont location - great area, not too crowded, and free garage parking literally next to the restaurant.   The place has a super cute, classy feel to it. There are 2 stories, and we were seated upstairs.   My sister got their stuffed French toast and it was unbelievable. Slightly crispy on the outside, soft otherwise, and the filling was delicious. My other sister tried the red velvet chicken and waffles - the waffle was one of the best red velvet waffles I've tried - drizzled to perfection with cream cheese.    I tried the Nasheville hot chicken with the sauce on the side! The chicken was a large, boneless piece and the sauce was perfect - not overly spicy, but definitely with a kick to it. I switched out my side to fries which were probably twice fried, but that much tastier, too!  Service was great and quick! Definitely recommend!!",

I could see a few modifications were made on the dishes like the addition of hush puppies and reduction of spicy gravy. Our server was pleasant and service was on point until the food came and my company kept ducking because the food was passed around across our faces and servers reached over our plates instead of around us to the left or even from behind.

The service is extremely fast but not rushed so you get to enjoy the food but don't have to wait too long to enjoy it.

We also got the spicy chicken biscuit and that was the perfect combination of spicy/sweet/salty! The jam was delicious!

After hearing my parents rave about this place, we decided to go with them and sadly it wasn't the best.  The food was alright, but what really brought our visit down was the service. We literally saw the waitress three times the whole time we were there.  Once to ask for drinks, second for the order, and last for getting our bill. Literally no service at all.   The funny thing was that upstairs, you can sort of see what staff is doing... And let's just say our waiter was having her phone out, watching videos, and distracting other waiters of doing their job...seems like having a grand ol' time. I mean, who wouldn't like that? Go to work, only work a little... And then get tipped? I still tipped, but nothing like what I usually tip.  For food, I got the breakfast casserole. I thought it wasn't bad, but felt like it was missing maybe a sauce as it was a little dry on the outside. Maybe a gravy? I don't know. It was missing something I felt. It came with ketchup, but it didn't fulfill what was missing. It came out like a block straight from a casserole dish, which was what I was expecting, but then when you bit into it... it just tasted dry.",

When my friend and I arrived, we were told the wait was 25 minutes but thankfully a table in the bar area opened up and we sat down quicker than the quoted 25 minutes. Chris was our server and he was very friendly, knowledgable about the menu and gave us his honest opinions about the dishes we had questions about. The food was so delicious and there was so much on the menu that looked good. I had the breakfast casserole, which was absolutely delicious but I can't wait to go back to try the shrimp and grits because they looked amazing! The bartender that morning (I wish I had gotten his name!) was amazing as well. Great service, great food, get there early!",

I change up whatever is on the menu and create my own and being as to how I work for service industry I know how irrtating this can be. The waiter will always smile and say lets see what we can do and 9 times out of 10 pull through. When they can not fulfill they always have a way to still deliver the message without any issues.  Today my friend and I sat at the bar behind the expiditer Ryan Duncan (I believe thats what I read on his chef's coat) and the window to the cooks. They hustled their ass's off, getting food out Hot, sauces on point and out in timely fashion at the peak time of brunch.  My hat off to them, excellent staff overall, food is always fantastic. Great Job Terrace! My bill came out to $36 (I ordered a ton of food) and I left a $26 tip. If I had more I would tip even more. They deserve it!!! I am your biggest fan!!",

From the time we walked it we were greeted with friendly smiles. Our wait was only 30 mins so that wasn't bad. I had the Red Velvet. Waffles with Fried Chicken. Everything was deliscious. The chicken wasn't over cooked and had a great flavor to it. The Grits were just how I like them, nice and creamy. The Mimosa was even great. I look forward to coming back and trying the Crab Cakes Eggs Benedict.",

Service was great once seated.  Food came out luke-warm and needed seasoning.  Then again prefer that to over-salted.  Might give it another try or maybe not given the many other options in Charlotte.",

    "text": "May I vent first thing about Piedmont Row, not Terrace Cafe?  I was all excited about trying TC, I decided to meet  one of my friends for an early lunch.   I hop on my bike, a brand new orange Electra Townie no less and park it in between Terrace Cafe and Dolcetto, two businesses that we should frequent so they can thrive.  Don't you know some man from somewhere does not like my bike locked  to a light post, rats me out to the security guard and there is a ruckus to get me to move my bike.We had already been seated and ordered and our food was on the tray on the way out of the kitchen.  I am in the restroom and  my friend sees them shaking my lock and  looking at my bike, she goes out and they tell her to park it somewhere else.  My friend said, \"our food is on the way, can't we move it in a minute?\"  It had to be taken care of that instant.    What were they going to do?  Fine me?  Tow my bike?  Jeez.  I moved it, but now I think I should have protested.  WTF?  Anyway, back to the matter at hand.    Terrace Cafe....  When I arrive, I  order some coffee, my friend shakes her head and makes me try her coffee first.  WEAK.  Am I the only person that hates weak coffee in a breakfast establishment?  I don't want cowboy coffee, I just want some decent coffee.  So, I order a latte.  A beautiful latte comes out.  Yeah!!!   I vacillate between breakfast and lunch, what a big decision.  Lunch wins, I decide on a half sandwich and 2 soups.  Interesting.  The concept of two soups, why make a decision, have both!!!  Boo, they were redundant.  Two broth soups.  The server said chicken noodle and vegetable.  Maybe it was my Campbell soup upbringing thinking veggie soup was tomato, my bad.   The BLT was thick sourdough bread, one slice was soggy, they were slathered in butter and then barely toasted.  Tomatoes had been in the fridge.  I think they care, but maybe just need some honest feedback.    My server was very nice and sincere and she was appalled that they made me move my bike. Even the security guard thought the guy was crazy too.    Did I mention I had to move my bike to the back of the shops at Piedmont Row near the YMCA?    I will go back to Terrace Cafe, they did have cocktails, so I am going back for breakfast and a bloody mary.  I will park my bike near the Y, so the uptight man can get on with his work and not be bothered with the eyesore of my Townie parked at a light post. GASP.  Follow up: went today (2oct) with another friend, we sat at the bar and ordered bloody marys and an order of onion rings.  The bloody marys were fabulous and garnished with bacon, need I say more?  Since my return, the coffee was much better!!!",

I'd say over the last 3 visits they have pretty much missed on everything. Today, we literally had the overall worse service  EVER! We waited over 45 minutes to be seated and people who came after us were seat before us. Once seated, we waited for water/drinks. After our food was served, we waited for utensils, we waited for coffee refills,  we waited for our check. We pretty much blew a whole Saturday on breakfast. They were very slow at cleaning the tables around us as we ate and those tables sat empty longer than expected. The larger parties received quick service and more attention and had I'd been paying, I wouldn't have left a tip at all. I felt totally disregarded as a customer from the moment I stepped in, until I walked out. There are much better breakfast /brunch spots in Charlotte. I will spend my time and money there.",

Supposedly, you can't make reservations for Sunday, but I heard people doing \"call aheads\" ... which is the same as a reservation in my book! Put name on list for 15-20 minute wait. Waited more that 20 minutes. Went inside and asked for update. Hostess said she texted our phone twice with no response and then deleted our spot. We received absolutely NO texts. This happened to 2-3 other people that I personally witnessed. Other groups of more people arrived ahead of us, ate and left before us (on a day with no reservations). The chicken apple sausage used to be two links (I think) and now it's one link cut lengthwise. The crab cakes benedict were ok and my wife's pancakes were ok, but they didn't say that the cakes came with powdered sugar by default which is something she doesn't like. So, the wait and the \"ok\" food are enough of a reason to not go back for Sunday breakfast for quite a while. We loved our server and the hostess seated us immediately after I asked for an update. So, I'd have to say that the service was decent, but was  the overall experience compelling enough to warrant a return visit (any time soon)? No.",

    "text": "After an 11.5 hour drive from South FL, aka SoFlo, we figured we'd stop by a brunch place to perk ourselves back up again. The drive into Charlotte, specifically South Park, was a beautiful experience... like the plaza alone is something I've never seen in SoFlo. And there it is, Terrace Cafe.  I ordered the Red Velvet Chicken & Waffles. It came out more like a rose color instead of the infamous deep red color you see in red velvet cake, but it still tasted just like red velvet, with the sweet cream cheese drizzle to compliment. Despite the drizzle, it wasn't soggy to my surprise. The waffle maintained it's outer crisp and inner fluffiness. The chicken was good, but I've had better. They use boneless chicken, and I'm into the kind you can gnaw on. I had ordered a cheesy grits for my side dish, and I was not impressed. It tasted like regular grits, and I wasn't sure if it had cheese. I should've asked for butter for taste, but there was no point, I didn't finish my waffle and chicken because I got full quick, so I knew I won't finish the grits either.  We ate til we got our fill, and I would consider coming back if I tried other stuff from the menu. Other items did entice me, so if I do hit Charlotte again, I'll consider coming back!",

I wasn't very hungry so I asked the waitress if I could have a waffle only (not wanting the 2 fried chicken breasts with the Chicken & Waffles). She said that wasn't a problem. Well, when she delivered the bill I was charged $17 for the waffle.  I reminded her I only got the waffle and I thought the price should be adjusted. She told me they didn't have time to \"customize orders\". The manager wouldn't take the time to come over and address the issue either. It was a very slow night in there (so he couldn't use the excuse he was too busy). There were only 2 other tables with customers in the  restaurant.   I will never go back here because my compliant was not addressed. The waitress couldn't even comprehend what I was telling her and the manager didn't want to be bothered.",

Deducted one star because we tried calling for 4 days in a row at various times, emailing, and using the online private dining and reservation link and no one ever got back to us.  Didn't even answer the phone (two of us tried over and over).  Somehow ran out of breakfast staples, but what we did get everyone was very pleased with.  Had people coming in from an hour and a half away specifically for brunch, so we wanted to make sure we knew we had a table the process.  Ended up waiting outside for an hour.  Will definitely go again, just would like the phones/emails to be answered.",

Who would have thought!?? But, that is enough of my spiel...  I went to Terrace on my last morning in Charlotte in search of a great brunch near my hotel. Parking was easy, and so was seating. I quickly ordered a peach cider mimosa and the red velvet chicken & waffles. It was good, but not great. The chicken left much to be desired. It was a little burnt and lacked in the seasoning department. Meh. The red velvet waffle was great however! Cooked well throughout and perfectly sweet. The cream cheese icing that they drizzle on top of it is amazing! I was one step away from asking for more lol! This is not someplace I'd think I'd return, but the ambiance was nice.",

The waffle is nice and crisp on the outside and soft moist and flavorful on in the inside.  The cream cheese drizzle is the icing on the cake, no need for syrup.  The chicken is extremely moist and well seasoned and fried to perfection.  I get ranch as my dipping sauce and it  too is delicious and fresh made.    The sweet tea never disappoints and they also make a delicious cup of coffee.  My kids love their pancakes and bacon.  My husband enjoyed their shrimp and grits when he's not getting chicken and waffles.  I have found the food and service to be better going during the week vs. on Sunday's for brunch.  This could be because of the crowd for Sunday brunch.",

Our food came out so fast and was absolutely delicious. I had the green waffle with a cream cheese drizzle, house made sausage, and cheddar cheese grits. My boyfriend had the full breakfast which included two eggs, country potatoes, chicken apple sausage, and banana pancakes.

It's not advertised well but we found out that the bar and the tables right at the door are first come first serve which might help with the wait if you are a small party.",

    "text": "I am going to start off by saying my experience today was one for the books. The restaurant was very busy so expected to have a longer wait than normal but thats all I expected. Unfortunately that was just the beginning of a bad experience. Our server took our order (Biscuits & Gravy w/ Loaded hash browns and Filet Eggs Benedict). Asked two times for waters still none. Finally the meals come out about 30 min later and my egg yolks already broken w/ English muffin soggy mess served Luke warm. To make things worse the Biscuits & Gravy were cold! Got ahold of mgmt since our server had not checked back in on us since taking order almost 45 min ago...  Matthew Thompson(Asst General Mgr) was very responsive and corrected the situation with a smile - giving us hope again. The food came out hot this time but was missing all the loaded part to our hash browns. He informed us would fix it on the bill and we were happy without it; just too hungry at this point. The food was averaged and felt it lacked flavor - wasn't impressed at all.   This next part is what pushed me over the \"edge\" to write this review. The General Manager (yes head boss) treated me with such lack of respect as a human let alone a customer of his. I asked him for our check for our server was missing. He handed it to me and I informed him of the issue and the loaded toppings on the hash browns needed to be removed (over $7 charge - no biggie but when told they would felt like it should be done) he then looks at the receipt and say $39 I got this (rude sassy tone) and rips the receipt in my face! The server, hostess and busback couldn't believe  what just happened. I was so taken back I just walked away, got my family and left. I will never never be returning to an establishment that feels it OK to disrespect a customer like that.",

Most definitely would recommended to friends if they were to find themselves in the area and want to grab a nice breakfast. The place was easy to find, although there was some parking situation which is understandable- it is a busy metropolitan area after all. The restaurant was ambient and clean, food came out fairly quickly, the white mocha did take a little extra- understandable and worth the wait it was tasty. My house coffee did taste a little burnt, but no problem with asking for a new one. As far as service, we both felt the place could use a servers/customer service or two for the morning shift due to the busy hours and to give a helping hand.   All in all, a great place. Enjoy our breakfast and place.",

    "text": "There's some amazing brunch food here. We ate here for a work breakfast with our entire department, about 20 people. They gave us space upstairs where we all could fit.   The menu was diverse. There are plenty of sweet options like red velvet waffles and lemon poppyseed french toast. I like a more savory breakfast. I ordered the quiche of the day which was chicken, cheddar and broccoli. And it came with a side salad and fruit. I added an order of the chicken apple sausage. The food was delicious. The quiche had a nice flavor and flaky crust. The salad was fresh with a light vinegrette. The chicken apple sausage was very tasty. My fruit never made it to the table. I know we're a large party. When our server asked if we needed anything else, I mentioned I was missing my fruit and she said she would bring it out. It never came. And she seemed overwhelmed so I didn't fuss about it.   Staff was friendly, but our server clearly needed more help. We did separate checks which is a pain, but we all could see her struggling. They really should have assigned two people to our group. A large group is hard to serve and part of my meal was missing as a result.   So really great food, but probably better for smaller groups.",

My mom had the carrot cake pancakes, which were delicious.  My sister had the crab cakes which were just ok, I've definitely had better.  The wait wasn't bad at all.  Our server was very attentive and personable.  Overall the atmosphere was awesome, service was great and the food was delicious.  I would definitely return the next time I visit Charlotte. I forgot to get a picture of my shrimp n grits because I smashed!",

The area we were in was tight but comfortable for the amount of people we had.  My issue was that I paid $40 for my meal and I can't say that it was worth it.  I had the shrimp and grits with the bbq sauce on the side. And also the crab bisque. Lastly, I got a drink (ordered it before my food but it came after). Our host was cool but a little loud.  I still don't think that this spot was worth $40. There's a free parking garage, which is nice. But the wait was like 30 minutes with only outside waiting.  I don't have any complaints about the food. Overall it was really goos. Just not worth $40.  So overall my 4 stars are for wait time and food pricing. Otherwise, l enjoyed my visit.",

Everything is super affordable and everyday they have a breakfast drink special. On Monday morning they had 5 dollars mimosas but I opt to go with the Bloody Mary which was tangy, sweet and smooth accented with a bacon. For my meal I got the biscuits and gravy which came with hash. It was to die for! Very hearty. I like the the fact the hash was shredded but it should've been more crispy, my only recommendation.   For two people my bill ended up being like 35 bucks. Awesome spot if you want to get a complete breakfast without breaking the bank.",

My fruit was not fresh as it had sat in a fridge somewhere proportioned in advance. The strawberries and cantaloupe were dried out. My eggs were really good and scrambled hard just as requested. The whipped cream is not fresh either so it's some cool whip processed topping. My remade waffle was piping hot and fresh. The cream cheese drizzle melted over the waffle perfectly. I ordered hash browns instead of fruit and they were really hot but under seasoned. Overall poor showing today at Terrace.",

The hostess gave us an estimate of 20mins for the 2 of us but we were seated with in 10-15mins.  Our waitress quickly came over to take our drink order. They have 5 different types of mimosas but she didn't know the difference in any of them. So I asked to find out and she came back with waters and an answer. We both got the Tropical Mimosa as it came with champagne and Malibu rum. The fried green tomato with pimento cheese dip looked good so I ordered that as a starter. It was pretty decent didn't care for the batter they were fried in but the pimento dip made it better. For my entree I went with the Bavarian Creme Stuffed French Toast Sticks, at first the waitress brought something else out but quickly corrected it. It doesn't come with any sides but it is 3 huge sticks, I don't know why I thought they would be smaller. But they were cooked perfectly, not undercooked and mushy but nice and firm but not hard. My friend enjoyed her Stuffed Monte Cristo, I tasted it and it was good the French Toast was just soggy but she said she likes it like that. All in all good meal.",

I got there first, received my buzzer for our table, and waited like everyone else. Cool. 45 minutes later the buzzer goes off because the table is ready. I turn in the buzzer and prepare to be seated, and I let the hostess know that my wife will be here in 10 minutes or less. She says, oh well I'm sorry but we can not seat you until she comes. Wait, what? Yes, you said there was a party of 2 so you have to wait until she gets here. I asked why and she says its policy and gave me the buzzer back. I waited 5 minutes and had to go back up to the desk. I'm trying to understand why I can't sit down. I said look, I've been standing here nearly 45 minutes and I'm ready to sit down. There is not another party of two, and if I said it was just me you would still seat me at a table with at least two chairs! She says well that's our policy and you already told us its a party of two so I'm sorry! She says look behind you you can sit right... Too late someone's there now! By then my wife walks in and I ask for the manager. Surprisingly, the hostess, Tasha says she is the manager! My wife asks where is your manager then. Tasha says oh he's already gone but there is his card, call him! It won't change anything! I said you know what, I'm hungry so let us eat so we can go. I'll just call the owner. She says well his name is Stuart and he lives upstairs! I was pretty pissed and it took everything in me not to be disrespectful back, but once seated we did call the manager Patrick I think. I'm starting to believe maybe she was right because although he apologized and said Tasha was wrong, I don't feel as if it was handled correctly. Very disappointed in this service today! Gotta do better to loyal customers!!!",

My patience paid off, because the food here is awesome. First, I'll comment on the atmosphere. The Terrace Cafe is decorated to look Italian, which threw me off a little because then I was expecting Mediterranean food, but I felt warm and comfortable here. They could have a little more seating for those of us waiting, but the wait wasn't really that bad. When we did sit down, we ordered mimosas, and they came pretty quickly. I got the waffle with strawberries on the top and I was oh so happy. My friend ordered a shrimp omelette, and I was jealous because it was so good. Next time I come, I'm getting that omelette! With a waffle on the side.",

I do have to note that the flavors of the dish were fine, not wonderful, but good enough to pay for. However my mother found two short black hairs on her plate. Neither of us have short black hair. The inexcusable part was the manner in which it was handled. The server was rude and unapologetic. And shockingly only half of the cost of the meal was removed from the bill. It is pretty standard in my opinion that when a dish is deemed inedible due to sanitation issues, it should be completely taken off.",

    "text": "Peeking out from the corner behind Taco Mac in Piedmont Row is Terrace Cafe. With a menu boasting S'mores French Toast and Red Velvet Waffles, there is often a wait list of people seeking an indulgent breakfast on weekends.  If there is no time to lose waiting for the hungry masses who beat you there, visit on a weekday, when there generally is not a wait.  Don't want dessert for breakfast? No matter, there is something for every taste and moderation level. Terrace Cafe even has a few dishes decorated with the seal of approval from the Harris Y Express and YMCA nutritionist. There is an obvious partnership there, as post-Y workout customers clad in sweats join groups of SouthPark soccer moms dining among local celebrities at Terrace. No, not Ric Flair (WOOO!) this time, but jack-of-all media, Jon Wilson (WILSON!)  According to the clearly over sat server, the Red Velvet Waffle is their breakfast bestseller. It is surprisingly airy and moist, and the well-portioned cream cheese drizzle is just the right amount of sweet to keep that nagging \"sugar belly\" sensation at bay.  Eggs Benedict and cheese grits that rival those at The Flying Biscuit are stars of the savory menu choices, and dishes are presented beautifully on geometrically angled platters. Seasonal fruit tops off the gluttony, and beverages are served in curved glasses that look like they'll tip, but due to the magic of physics, do not.  Your full belly may make you tip, though, after sampling the fine foods at Terrace Cafe.",

I know you're jealous of my communication skillz.  Anywho, Terrace Cafe, a cute little cafe burrowed in the Piedmont Town Center. Truthfully, when I was seated upstairs and took in their menu for a few minutes, I wasn't wowed by their lunch selections. However, my friendly waitress told me about their lunch specials, including a \"healthy\" slab of quiche baked with feta, house roasted turkey, tomatoes, spinach and onions. This $10 special was served with a substantial side of greens and a generous fresh fruit cup.   Um, YUM. I love quiche in general, but this particular slab (not exaggerating here) was creamy, well made and finished with a tasty crust. It was quite a nice portion for a ten spot, especially for lunch. The turkey was ridiculously good and I was really impressed with the quality of the quiche.   I'd really like to come back and give their breakfast/brunch a shot as the red velvet waffles were taunting me.",

The s'more waffle is too sweet for a meal, it works well as a dessert, though. The service has always been good even when they're slammed. If you're planning to go Sunday for brunch, plan to wait for a table due to this place's popularity, but it's worth it of you plan for it.

It wasn't bad, but for half the price I had the same thing at The Original Pancake House  this morning and enjoyed it just as much or possibly more.  Granted, I could have ordered something with a little bit more imagination, but if a restaurant can't handle simple things then I have to wonder whether or not it can handle more complex items.    The hummus appetizer we ordered arrived with sesame seed covered pita for dipping.  Unfortunately, I can't say much for the hummus because it was completely overwhelmed by the flavor of the sesame seeds on the pita.  I'm not a fan of sesame seeds, so I took one bite and left it at that.  My companion ordered the tomato and mozzarella salad and really enjoyed it.  He also enjoyed the hummus more than I, but he likes sesame seeds so....  Thanks to a $30 gift certificate from Groupon, our lunch tab was only $18.00.  (I paid $12 for GC and left $6 tip.)  Without the GC, our tab would have been almost twice as much.  I'll try Terrace Cafe again because I have another gift certificate.  Hopefully next time I'll be as pleased with my meal as some of the other reviewers.",

    "text": "I visited Terrace Cafe with a friend while on an extended layover in CLT (it's only about 15-20 mins from the airport). The restaurant was a tad difficult to find, as it was tucked into a complex of office buildings interspersed with other restaurants among the buildings and courtyards. Anyway, parking was simple and free in the neighboring garage, so that made life easier.  The restaurant interior is fairly roomy. It's a large loft-like space with extremely high ceilings. It almost felt like there was a lot of wastage of space in the setup, but it worked if loft-like is what they were going for. Definitely not the place to go if you're looking for a more intimate ambiance.  The food was good...and unique breakfast selections! Normally you get the usual breakfast options, but Terrace Cafe has some interesting versions and flavors of pancakes and french toast and waffles and the like. They also have a variety of omelettes, among other breakfast choices.   My friend and I ordered the banana pecan french toast, the egg white veggie omelette, and a side of hash browns to share. The banana pecan french toast was interesting. They literally took banana bread and lightly coated it in french toast batter. It was good, but a little TOO sweet. Perhaps one of the other many french toast flavors would've been more suitable. The veggie omelette was great. Very healthy, not overly oily, and perfectly done. The hashbrowns were tasty and very crispy.  I'd recommend this place as a breakfast place to anyone visiting the Charlotte area. I really liked the variety and unique flavors of breakfast foods available.",

    "text": "I used to really like Terrace Cafe but the food and service has been declining. Our last visit was the last straw. It was a weekday morning so tables were readily available. It took a long time for the host to come back to the stand. That is fine. But the weird part is the two bartenders who were not busy at 10:30am looked at us like we're annoying - like we were interrupting their conversation. Then multiple servers made eye contact with us and walked by. Wouldn't it be normal to say good morning, we will be right with you? I truly felt like I walked into a private function and the dirty looks were to get us to leave. I was so close to leaving and I should have. We were taken upstairs and seated at a 2 top as close to a booth with very young and loud children. Then a table of four with a screaming child from the start was seated next to us. The other table dissolved into full blown on the floor meltdowns. We asked to move to the side of the top where no people were when we were originally seated. We quickly learned the upstairs is the child section as that section then had kids too. It was impossible to finish the crab cake Benedict given the screaming - meltdown screaming. Downstairs, there was not one table with children. Given that the food is mediocre at best, this was just unacceptable. When I asked the host why he would put two adults in the section that was clearly filled with kids, he said it was part of the rotation but did notice the tantrum  occurring on the floor. Oh well.",

The only reason they received two stars one for the hostess and the Cupcake Latte I ordered. The food was awful I spent $50 bucks for two people and neither one of us really enjoyed anything. It was hard to see all the people lined up to get Inside and not tell them how the food taste... While i did NOT any eggs I didn't not have to. This place did not make the cut!!!",

    "text": "Get to Terrace Cafe stat if you are a professional brunch'er life myself.  The brunch was delicious.    I've actually been to Terrace Cafe twice.  The first time I got the signature red velvet waffle and chicken.  It was mediocre at best.  Nothing special about the waffle and the breading of the chicken came off as soon as you cut it.  I hate that!  So fast forward to six mos later and my brunch crew decided to go to Terrace.  I was like cool - I hear folks rave about it, lemme give it a 2nd shot.  The french toasts are awesome.  We all got different kinds.  Mine was by far the best.  It was the seasonal pumpkin.  The lemon poppy seed was good, but a little dry.  They have removed the banana nut french toast from the menu.   We inquired about it and were told it was gone, followed by our server saying \"everyone asks about it.\"  So why would they remove something so popular.    So why is this place not 5 stars?  Well I can't forget the mediocre first experience.  I also hate  'no reservations' and the fact that they won't seat you until your whole party is there.  I have a perpetually late girlfriend.  4 of us arrived and waited, and waited and waited...they would not seat us until the 5th got there.  That is an annoyance.  I can understand why, but they'd rather leave those booths empty then seat us.  Here's why I say that.  When girlfriend finally arrived we were seated upstairs in the only tables (booths actually) that could accommodate more then 4 people...well all of the booths were empty.  So my question is why 'hold' them and make us wait in the coffee bar.  Did they think we were lying about having the 5th person?  It just didn't make sense and was irritating.  They also got one of the orders wrong.  Service seemed frazzled. We never had the same server twice actually.",

I hear their brunch is really special.  I like the place, nice people, excellent servers, comfortable surroundings. Unusually friendly staff. I was dining alone and they made me feel like I was partying with them.  I ordered the Pork Tenderloin with Succotash and Fingerling Potatoes. The pork was cooked to perfection. Many restaurants over cook pork and it gets tough. This dish was outstanding. Great sauces, flavors, etc.  I like their condensed menu where they focus on being good at a select number of item instead of the all things to all people approach.  I will be back to try another entree. Visit this place and give them support. They are trying to launch their dinner menu and could use the business so give them a try.. Good price/value.",

EB is a classic dish for a reason. There is no benefit in trying to switch it up. The hollandaise was made with whole grain mustard, which destroyed the best part of the dish. The meat disks were about the diameter of a golf ball, and I don't even remember what the bread/English muffin was like.  Our server was a bit lukewarm, and, once things got super busy, the amount of time between visits to our table became way too long. Table mates sat without beverage refills for a while.   The space is pretty nice. It's bright and clean, but I could have certainly done without all the religious paraphernalia and signage at the host stand. If I wanted to deal with that, I'd go to a pancake breakfast at a local church. Couldn't wait to get out of there.",

I don't think there's enough or even the right words in the English dictionary to be able to describe the delectable flavors of this incredibly tasty restaurant. I ate there FOUR times while I was in the area.   I has the following (not necessarily in this order): - Salted Caramel Mocha with soy milk - Coffee shops of the west coast (specifically SF) please contact the chef for the recipe and let me when you get it! This would replace my beloved long term addiction to Peets Coffee. And that's saying something! If you like salted caramel and chocolate and coffee, this is a drink worth trying.  - S'mores French Toast - I don't think I could ever get this again since it was too sweet for me but despite that, I felt like I was sitting around a camp fire enjoying s'mores. Take a  trip back to childhood and try this treat.  - Garlic Hummus - Had this with co-workers and while we all really enjoyed it, we all agreed it wasn't that garlicky.  - Fennel Pollen Dusted Grouper - This was incredibly good! Although I wish there was a bit more asparagus on the plate but I am sure that's my California self showing.   If you want to take a journey with your tastebuds, check this place out!",

It was weekend so we had to wait for sometime before we got seating but trust me it was worth the wait. We ate so much we could hardly move :) I guess this is best way to celebrate birthday! I loved their famous Red Velvet Waffles. Great Service and great food!",

I wouldn't say it took long to get the replacements, but by the time the warm eggs arrived, the rest of the meal had cooled down.  I went ahead and ate the breakfast and it would've probably been really good had it been served piping hot. To give the benefit of the doubt, Terrace was VERY busy which means they must get it right most of the time. Maybe it was just bad luck for me. My girlfriend did enjoy her breakfast.  Anyway, aside from that, the atmosphere of the place is quite nice. Its contemporary American and very lively for a morning spot. I'd probably give them another shot if I lived in the area but I was jut passing through.  Oh, and the final nitpick, the bill charged for 2 orders of eggs. The staff removed the additional order.",

I have passed the area that it's in a few times but never really thought to venture in . It's tucked away right near the parking garage, which is kinda convenient and a short walk. We went on a Sunday around 12pm maybe and we waited around 30 mins for a table of 3. I tried a Mimosa which was good, more champagne than I expected so that was a plus along with the chocolate chip malted Belgian waffle with a side of grits and hash browns. The waffle came with one side but I'm southern so it's only right that I have grits with my meal  Overall my food was good presentation wide could have been a bit better for the waffle - looks like they literally threw some chocolate chips on there and sent it out the door. I definitely would go back to try an omelet or the French toast! The only annoying part is that they don't' have much waiting room inside so either you stand out in the cold or cram inside.",

My original brunch place all the way in the Plaza but totally worth the drive has gotten a bit too repetitive so while enjoying dinner one night at Piedmont, stumbled on this place. Super cute inside, friendly staff and aaahhhh yes, the sunday wait line. No problem, get yourself a latte and sip away until your called to the table. The food is so good, you wish you knew about it sooner. The eggs benedict floentine is my favorite. The french toast with creme bruele butter is so good you want to ask for more butter to go. The too have the apple butter sauce my original location carried (I thought it was signature mark, guess not, its bought by a bigger vendor). I can't wait to go back on Sunday!",

Lets break it down for someone who hasn't been here:  The food is ALWAYS (and I mean every single thing I have ever ordered) right and tastes great, even when they are slam packed, which is often.   There are some fun things on the menu (especially breakfast) that you would be hard pressed to find anywhere else.  Ex. red velvet waffle, WOW  The staff is always busy but always friendly  My only complaint is that they are so damn good they get busy and there is often a wait but I can't hate on them for being too popular!!!!!",

So he sat while everyone ate. By the time we got it everyone was done eating. We took his food to go instead. The waiter didn't even give us a reasoning and wasn't willing to accommodate us for the inconvenience, and to top it off, gave us an attitude when we asked to speak to the manager.  A basic plain caesar salad was $6. I had iceberg lettuce, croutons, and added chicken.... $15. $11 for a piece of chicken?? All in all, never ever ever going back there. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Over priced. The atmosphere sucks. Loud. Cramped. Portions of food are small... Leave you feeling hungry still. Would rather just go to Chili's.",

No, perhaps I should have went for breakfast? Probably. I ordered an appetizer of fried green tomatoes and pimento cheese. They came out very hot and crispy with tons of flavor, easily the best part of my experience. My main course was the trout, veggie rice pilaf and tempura green beans. The food was by no means bad but it also wasn't anything memorable. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing because my friend loved his steak. I left feeling very underwhelmed, sucks when the appetizer is more exciting than main course. Whenever I return it will be for breakfast.  PS - you would think that a classy restaurant could offer a better beer selection than boring bud, coors and miller. Sure they had Sierra Nevada and Fat Tire but that was it. Beer is just as, if not more complex than wine, recognize.",

Every item I've had there has been of really good quality, but I always seem to come away with a feeling of paying too much for too little.  I'm a guy who likes to eat (uggg, dieting now) and when I find good food I like to have it in decent quantities, I didn't feel like I was getting enough.  Example: I had their burger and fries.  The burger WAS of a decent size, but the fries, not so much.  I work in PTC so this is a place I can walk to, but to be honest, I don't go here for lunch anymore.  The one exception:  Morning coffee/breakfast biscuit $5 takeout special, was a big biscuit with whatever you want in it and a decently sized cup of coffee.  Update 10/28/2013 - I'm growing to like this place more and more, based solely on the above mentioned takeout special.  I get it, this place caters to folks who want a more upscale breakfast, and by all accounts, they deliver.  Their offering of the value breakfast makes the value proposition more.",

It was very cold and rainy so we waited right inside the cafe. As we were waiting we noticed that the seating arrangements made no sense. They seated two people at a table for four, when a family of four had been waiting for a while. They did this multiple times then had to push two tables together to seat families of three or four. We also had to ask if our table was ready as it had been over 35 minutes. Once seated, our waiter quickly introduced himself and asked for our drink order. Next, he asked for our meal order. Our food came quite quickly, and it tasted pretty good. My older sister ordered pancakes, and was very impressed. My younger sister ordered two animal pancakes, an egg, and bacon. She was also very happy. Both my parents ordered chicken and waffles, and enjoyed the food as well. I ordered a red velvet waffle with a side of grits and bacon. While the food was good, it was not amazing. Enjoyed the experience but the 35 minute wait was not quite worth the food.",

The restaurant was very busy when we arrived and there was a line even to give names to the hostess, but the bar had open seats and we just went over to there and ordered immediately.  She had the lemon poppy French toast and while she said the flavor was there, it was less like eggy bread and more like eggy cake. Very sweet and the berries on top were great. Especially so since they were more room temperature and not frozen like they'd just come from the cooler.  I had the florentine benedict. The poached eggs were perfectly cooked and popped when cut. The muffin underneath was a little underdone but the spinach was excellent. LOVED THE HOME FRIES. The fried onion strings on top were an interesting garnish.  We also got a \"half order\" of a biscuit and sausage gravy. This was really yummy with a nice peppery gravy that had lots of sausage bits and a good fluffy biscuit underneath.  Good choice for breakfast!",

    "text": "I was super excited to try Terrace after reading so many great reviews and also because of the vegan breakfast they have on the menu. To say that I was disappointed doesn't even begin to describe my experience. Our server was not only condescending and not very knowledgeable about the menu, she was not attentive at all. In fact, she came across as bored. Her behavior was an immediate turnoff. The food was \"okay.\" I'm sure the non-vegan fare is amazing but the vegan offering wasn't seasoned well and was over cooked. I had to ask repeatedly for my coffee to be refilled, and they kept giving everybody in our party the wrong order. It was a chaotic nightmare.   The only saving grace was that my company was fantastic so the conversation made the very poor service tolerable.   I will not be returning, at least not to the Southpark location. Perhaps the Ballantyne location has better trained servers.",

I've been requesting that the bananas be cooked with the French toast and topped with the syrup dressing, but this just hasn't been the case.

Strike 1: After waiting for 45 minutes we asked the hostess where we were in line and she told us we were next, yet we were not called next and got completely skipped over for an incomplete party when there is clearly a sign at the front that says they don't sit incomplete parties! Strike 2: they didn't have silverware, coke, sweet tea, clean dishes, nor did they have clean glasses. Strike 3: the food was completely flavorless. Not quite sure why people eat here. Our server was overwhelmed with other tables and barely even spoke to us. I think the only thing I enjoyed was my glass of water and my walk out of the door!  Update in response to the owner: A busy restaurant explains the lack of supplies but being skipped over in line is complete incompetence by the hostess and the other staff members up front. And the other party was still taken to their table despite us calling the hostess out on her error prior to them being seated.",

I've been spoiled by all you can eat, everything included brunches...thanks DC :) so it's hard to find anything comparable to that experience in another city. I went ahead and decided to give Terrace Cafe a shot since it was so highly recommended by my friends and coworkers.   We arrived around noon and were seated within ten minutes of arrival. I put my name on the waitlist while my friend parked the car. Our table was ready before she entered the restaurant; the waitress stated that all party members, even though it was just two of us, need to be present before being seated. Luckily, my friend stepped in the door a few minutes after the news so this requirement didn't pose a problem for the beginning of our dining experience.  Our drink order was taken and we were given a few minutes to look over the menu. I asked the waitress for her recommendations, she told me two of her favorites but really didn't sell me on either as her recommendations were short, sweet, and lacked detail.  I was a bit surprised by the lack of information and decided to go with what looked good to me :).   My go to breakfast is French Toast, eggs, sausage or bacon, and hashbrowns.  Here the French toast stands alone as a menu item...bacon, eggs, etc are ala carte. This one little detail definitely influenced my final decision. I went with the Full Breakfast (Two eggs over easy, chicken apple sausage , cheese grits, and  substituted one slice of French toast for the two pancakes). Oh yeah, they have strict guidelines for substitutions and there is a charge to swap the pancakes for the French Toast. The French Toast was dense and lacked flavor. I saw what looked like cinnamon and maybe nutmeg sprinkled atop the bread but definitely did not taste it. The chicken apple sausage was delicious; I would definitely order that again. Finally, the eggs over easy and cheese grits were the most well prepared breakfast items for today's visit. Based on recommendations from trusted sources, I was expecting a better breakfast experience. I hope that my next visit will be more eventful.",

I've had brunch at Piedmont once and brunch at Ballantyne once and both were great (my friends love the bacon in the bloody mary) but dinner is some of the best upscale Southern food I've had.    The only reason I don't go more often is sometimes I'm too hungry to endure the wait, but if I plan ahead and make reservations it all works out.",

We got a cup of coffee at the bar while we waited, but for 2 black coffees it was almost $6?! That kind of set the tone for what was in store. It was very busy, and the service was pretty good. I got the eggs Benedict and they were okay. Ordered the fried green tomatoes as a side. Not sure what spice/s they use, but no one at our table was a fan. We ended up throwing them away, which I so hate to do. Nothing here makes me want to return, unfortunately.",

Terrace Cafe is one of the few places that I know of in Charlotte that does brunch on Saturdays. They also don't take reservations, so expect a wait due to its popularity. I went with my boyfriend at 11:40AM on Saturday and were seated within 30 minutes.  Their bloody marys were good. Warning: the Diablo Bloody Mary was very spicy, but the others were of normal intensity. We ordered the shrimp & grits, chocolate chip waffle, and biscuits & gravy. The shrimp & grits was good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce they had. The waffle was a good cake-y consistency (I prefer it that way). The biscuits & gravy were to die for. And I've grown up in the south my whole life.   All in all, I had a good experience. Food was good, service was quick and accommodating, and the restaurant had a good vibe to its decor.",

    "text": "I'm so glad I found this place! It was my first time, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes cute restaurants with good food.  The Good:  1) It's a great location! I am staying at the Doubletree Hilton Southpark and it was maybe a 5 minute drive. I had considered walking, but the forecast called for rain. I don't know why people complained about parking. Yeah, I had to drive to the fourth level of the parking garage, but it was completely free. Especially given the area, the parking situation was great.   2) Decor. It had a cute feel. There was a chalkboard with drinks listed which was cute. I love chalkboards. Also, I sat at the top level over looking the restaurant, so I was able to look at everybody's food and drinks before I ordered.  3) Food. The most important part! It was extremely hard to decide what to eat because I wanted everything (in part because I'm visiting from upstate NY where you can't find chicken and waffles, grits, biscuits and gravy, etc). I decided on the red velvet waffle with chicken, a side of fruit, and a half order of biscuits n gravy. I loved the waffle! It had cream cheese frosting on it. Not much, just enough for sweetness. I didn't even add syrup. The chicken was a little dry, but it had great flavor and was very crunchy. The biscuit and gravy was good. It wasn't salty, but was creamy, the biscuit was fluffy, it was just nice. The fruit was ok.  4) Service. The hostess was nice. I called before  I came, and the hostess was helpful with all my questions. My waiter was just ok. He didn't seem too happy to be there, but he did take back the one item I didn't like (lemonade) and didn't charge me. I will say, though, he was a lot nicer than many other waiters I've encountered in this area.  The Bad:  1) The Lemonade- Since I've been visiting NC this week, I've had much of my favorite fast food, Chick fil A. That being said, the bar is pretty high for lemonade, especially at the price they're charging for it. I expected a fresh squeezed lemonade with real sugar, but I think it was some kind of mix, maybe Minute Maid. It went back.  2) Cupcake Latte- They had several flavors, including Peanut Butter Cup latte, but I've never had cupcake flavor so I went for it. It was plain. It just tasted like a really sweet latte. I'll pass.  3) Dessert- Yeah, I had dessert too (but I got it to go, don't judge!) I got the pineapple upside down cake, which has a layer of cheesecake in the middle. It came cold, which is fine since I was taking it and could heat it later. It's good, and really sweet. The pineapples on top are amazing. But it was $7 for a small slice. Not that I needed a lot, I just feel like it's overpriced.  For the red velvet waffle with chicken and side of fruit, biscuit and gravy side, pineapple upside down cake, and cupcake latte, I paid $31. Not too bad I guess. I really liked the place, so I'd go again.",

To begin, I would lie to start with the service. Since it was Father's Day, we were expecting it to not be the greatest service, which is totally fine. However, our first server seemed to have no interest in us whatsoever, and he made some poor, overworked server take his place instead. Our service from this next server was decent, probably because she had so many tables to staff. Also, when our food arrived, we had no utensils on our table, and we waited a good five minutes before any utensils were brought to us (by the way, my Dad had to get up and find someone instead of just waiting even longer for our server to show up).   Now for our mediocre food. Everything but the lemon poppyseed French toast was just \"meh\" food. I ordered the Bavarian creme French toast sticks, which sounded good, and they actually okay apart from the very oily taste from them being deep fried and there not being creme in the whole French toast stick. The other dishes we ordered that were just okay as well were the full breakfast and eggs Benedict. Not only was the full breakfast overpriced for what it was, but it did not come as ordered either. Not to mention, my dad got food poisoning from it as well (on Father's Day!:( )  Overall, the only good thing about this place was the lemon poppyseed French toast.",

    "text": "Remember the days, when you thought you had to eat at Waffle House, IHOP, or Cracker Barrel for breakfast on Saturday or Sunday mornings?  Not so much because they were especially great or anything, but maybe because you knew they were there for you, and could be counted on to provide a hearty and delicious breakfast, time and time again.  WELL, those days are over my friends.  Say, hello to Terrace Cafe.  I'm usually not one to dote over the intricacies of the decorations and feng-shui of a place, but Terrace Cafe truly has a remarkable interior.  The second you walk in, you are transported to a wonderful and peaceful cafe seemingly somewhere in the  Mediterranean.  My gf and I arrived there around 10am on Sunday morning, and were seated immediately with no wait.  We were taken for a nice walk throughout the restaurant, and upstairs to a table in the balcony overlooking the entire restaurant (see pics).  For breakfast, i ordered the Steak and Eggs w/ hash browns and an English muffin.  I order this every time I go here, maybe just switching up the English-muffin for toast.  It's not that I think the other menu choices will be less than satisfactory, but because the Steak and eggs are out of this WORLD!!  It comes with 2 or 3 eggs any way you like, and two steak fillet medallions (see pic).  These little medallions are as good as any steak I've had.  No sauce needed.  No knife needed.  Just good, tender beef.   My girlfriend ordered a pecan waffle with the fresh fruit cocktail as a side.  She loved it.  The waffle was cooked to perfection (I just had to eat some).  Warm syrup was also brought to the table just before the food arrived.  She loved the waffle as well as the fruit.  Explaining that the fruit was fresh and sweet.  As for the service...It was magnificent.  Nothing else needs to be said.    I'm a fan of everything about this place. Ive been here three times (all for breakfast) and have had tremendous dining experiences each and every time.  I do not have a single complaint about my dining experiences there - ever; in the three times I've been there.   Terrace Cafe is the BEST BREAKFAST SPOT IN CHARLOTTE!!",

Clearly, everyone else in Charlotte loves brunch a much as we do. Luckily, there's a nice little waiting area outside and you can also order some coffee or drinks from the bar while you're waiting.   Now, I'm a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to benedicts, but the Sausage Eggs Benedict (eggs, sausage, and Hollandaise on a biscuit) with cheese grits was beyond tasty. We also got the Fried Oyster Salad (it's a salad so it's definitely healthy, right?) Overall, great food and I wish I was able to try more of the menu when I was here!",

    "text": "I found the Terrace Cafe with a \"Weekday Brunch in Charlotte\" Google search. I had a friend in town for a job interview and we were in desperate need of a brunch spot. I was ill-prepared for just how many restaurants only have weekend brunch. All of that to say, my expectations weren't super high.   We began our brunch with the only downside of the experience--an extremely long wait! There were empty tables all around and folks were moving in and out somewhat quickly, but it. took. forever. Luckily, the wait was worth it. I ordered the Red Velvet Waffle. I was both excited and nervous about the choice. I mean, I LOVE some red velvet ANYTHING, but I'm also not a huge fan of exceedingly sweet dishes--especially for breakfast. I'm the girl that can only handle like 1/4 of a cupcake at a time. Max. The waffle was DELICIOUS, though, and just the right about of sweetness without being at all overpowering. My friend ordered the Lemon Poppy French Toast and was equally impressed! Our waiter was exceedingly charismatic, attentive (without being annoying), and just wonderful!  It was a somewhat accidental stumble-upon adventure. But, it was an all-around great experience and I will certainly be back!",

Ordered water. Was wondering why on the bottom of the \"specials card\" said 1/2 price wine. Cool, but they don't tell you it's only on house wine. No Pinot Grigio was listed. Opted against wine.  We ordered. 10 minutes later, here comes my Cheese steak sandwich. No one else's food. Just mine. So 5 minutes later here comes the rest of the food. My son loved his, my friend got fish and chips, greasy and battered, like Captain Ds. The jalepeno horseradish sauce smelled bad. My friends' son had over easy eggs that he couldnt even cut with his fork. So my sandwich was cold and asked for another. They turned my sandwich over on the flat-top and burned the \"meat\". Didnt even make a new sandwich, which btw, had about 2oz of some kind of meat. We asked for another piece of fish. Our waitress brought it, fries were cold, not to mention she dropped the plate off and had already taken our silverware away. And she never came back! IT SUCKED!!! ALL THE WAY AROUND. Our waitress didnt say 2 words to us, no smile, nothing! Manager was nice and gave us free dessert. I wasnt charged for my meal and my friend got 50% off of her meals.",

    "text": "I will start by saying this, if you are in a group of 5+ you will wait a while to get sat. Why you say? Let me explain. As we are in town for Memorial day weekend our friends decided to come check this place out, so we just decided to tag along. Get there and wait is already at an hour- hour and a half, which by Atlanta standards is ok to me, so we decided to wait. An hour goes by, nothing, so my friends decide to check with the hostess about 1:15 of us waiting, just to see where we were, to her replying \"you still have 15 minutes left to wait\"? Huh? What? Isn't that estimated time just an exaggerated amount for us to wait? Or plain leave so you don't have to deal with a large party? As you can tell, the mood slowly started going down hill, and attitudes started flaring. Now, i'm no stranger to waiting, but to tell me how much time i still have to wait? Were you trying to seat us or no? Either way, right at 1hour and 35mins we get called and proceeded to get sat down. Mind you, tons of groups went ahead of us. Either way, we started placing our order to a waitress that couldn't seem to focus, kept looking at us and paying attention to the next table, which she stopped in the middle of us giving her the order to go help the next table, and then coming back. Huh?? Moving on, 35 mins later we got our food; i got the Monte Cristo which was actually pretty good, nice twist with the french toast. Paired with that was some coffee, which I could have been better off with. Tasted more like gas station coffee. At this prices why not have top notch ingredients? Lastly, we paid and got out as quickly as we could. If you have about 2.5hrs to blow just waiting and to quickly eat then this is the place. I don't think i'll make the effort into coming here again. Educate that staff with better customer service practices.",

I got pancakes and eggs and sausage and it was good. I tasted my friends red velvet waffle and it was deelish! My other girlfriend got French toast and loved it!!

The server kept forgetting to provide utensils, substitute to order and etc. this was not a big deal because I'm flexible. However I reviewed the Sunday menu on 4/7/2019 at 1:00pm and notice that the menu mention a loyalty program and you will receive a dessert for your birthday month. Not the exactly date but birthday month.I ask the server if I sign up today would I be able to receive the birthday dessert The server forgot during dinning. So I ask again and she ask the manager. The manager told the server that they could not do it because my birthday have past.( I told them my birthday was last week) I ask why because on the menu it said birthday month.  The server ask the manager to explain and he said he could only do if I received a coupon code. I did not understand why the restaurant could not be accommodating since the menus said birthday month and I sign up. I'm really writing this review on principle . I work in service and you want to make the customer happy.  At first I could not received the birthday dessert bc it was not my birthday but now I need to receive a coupon code. I just believe they just did not want to accommodate for what reason I will not know.",

This time, we went in for brunch on a Friday. They do brunch M-S until 3pm, which is great. We need more places in Charlotte doing daily brunches! The hubs got a chai tea latte, which was very delicious. Perfect amount of foam and spice and not overly sweet. Also, it's served in a nice comfortable large mug.  I went with the Florentine Benedict with a side of Canadian Bacon. Pro tip: add the bacon to your benedict. Delicious and adds a whole new savory flavor dimension. The Benedict was very good, and the home fries were crispy, just as I like them! I stole some bites of my husbands lemon poppyseed French toast. It's served with icing and berries and comes with 3 pieces. I found the French toast slightly too crumbly, but my husband loved it!  Service was decent, though it was pretty busy on a Friday afternoon. Next time I'll have to get the fried chicken and waffles.",

The people I was with ordered food as well with a side of fries but these fries were different from the ones we are accustomed of getting. We asked the waiter when did they change them and he said it changes all the time. Other than that and them not having any dr. Pepper everything was great",

    "text": "I am writing this review while I'm sitting here at breakfast (which is probably rude) considering that my breakfast date is looking at me. The atmosphere is really rustic and welcoming. First- it took the server roughly 7 min to even greet us or take our drink order (not terribly an issue) but I do like to be acknowledged in a reasonable amount of time.  The food came from another server who was visible distraught because of how busy she was but the food was amazing. I had the Chicken and Waffles- it was delicious but not the best I have had in Charlotte (that belongs to NAPA). It was priced correctly and the waffle wasn't cold or soggy. The chicken was moist and breaded just the right amount. Overall I was very pleased with the food.   Problem is that- although the food was great- the service was abysmal. My server saw me twice- to take my order and then again after I was done with my food so she can ask if anyone checked on us that entire time. They didn't and I waited 5 min to get syrup. I would have waited longer if my guest hadn't gotten up went to the server station and ask another server for syrup. I would have actually waited until my server came back to the table. The server was apologetic but that wasn't merely enough for not even asking if they got our food correct. It was the first time in almost 7 years that I tipped only 15% of the bill. This was a Thursday morning not Sunday brunch. I was disappointed.  Again- great food but TERRIBLE SERVICE.",

I was craving their SEC biscuit today and wanted the fruit as a \"healthier\" side. Biscuit was good as usual and I even checked the fruit to make sure. It looked good but as soon as I picked up the raspberry, there was a blueberry underneath covered in mold!!!! Ewwwwww! I can't believe it happened to me too!!   I was so upset I took the cup of fruit back to show the manager and his respond was \"I apologize, do you want another cup of fruit?\" Was he waiting for me to say \"Yes, please give me another cup of fruit full of mold. I've been waiting all my life to eat that!\"?   How about give me back the money I spent on that nasty cup of fruit that I don't want? But of course he didn't offer. Of course I had to pay for that with the mold in it.   Please stay away from this location! Bad fruit and bad management overall.",

I was impressed with the menu this evening. Everyone was offered a glass of white or red wine. I selected the Chardonnay. I believe the other was a Merlot.   Each course was served on small plates.  The Appetizers - Wild Mushroom Crostini and Buttermilk Calamari. I loved these items! If I had to choose, I'd say the Crostini was my favorite. The three cheese spread is life changing.   The Beet salad was refreshing, however It didn't earn my memory.   Entrees - Bourbon Braised Beef Short Ribs, Shrimp and Grits, and finally The Gnocchi & Wild Mushrooms. I was a fan of everything! I noticed the shrimp and grits came with a sauce---Which I didn't receive, I was slightly disappointed. The side of Vegetable medley was a after thought. No seasoning. I wouldn't recommend ordering this.   Finally! Dessert!! I couldn't pass up the peanut butter fudge cheesecake! I should've ordered a slice to go!! I picked off the chocolate seemed a bit much. Plan to return in here again soon for brunch.",

The chicken sausage is also great here. The pricing wasn't bad either. For 5 people (3 adults & 2kids) we paid around $60. I would recommend anyone in town to visit this place. Also, try the red velvet waffle. :) you won't be disappointed.",

There were literally 5 tables of people in this normally busy place, and somehow, we managed to get the worst service and barely warm food.  Pretty sure our food was sitting downstairs for a while when some other server finally brought it up.  Maybe it's because our server was busy facebooking on her phone a couple tables over from us?  We had to wait several minutes just to flag down someone else to get us fresh coffee!  Then we waited and waited to pay our bill only to find out she was busy going to get her own breakfast so she could plop back down in her booth to text and eat. Seriously?!   We thought about filling out the comment card that was with our bill, but even that was nasty and coffee stained.  Not good.",

    "text": "After hearing great things about this place my friends finally took me here and the food was delicious!   My first impression of this place was the decor. The cafe has high ceilings and a upper level seating area. The ambiance is nice. As all brunch places if you're not there before 10:30-11am the wait time will be longer. We got there early and were seated immediately (side-note: you will not be seated unless your entire party is there).   We ordered coffee's and lattes to drink. The coffee was so smooth and my friend who is picky about her cream choices was given a specially made latte to her liking. Now thats great customer service.   For food:  - Red Velvet waffle (as a starter... don't you judge us!) - Kids 2 pancakes (with choice of meat) and side fruit and eggs - sausage egg and cheeses biscuit with side of hash browns - two quiche specials (chicken option) with side salads - side order (1/2) of the biscuit n gravy  everyone loved their food. My sausage egg and cheese biscuit was HUGE! It was perfectly soft on the inside. Their sausage is hand made at the location (amazinggg). Kinda spicy but i like the heat.  My friends loved their quiches. The portions here are quite large and the food is filling for sure.   the all-star of the experience however was their red velvet waffle with cream cheese drizzle and a huge strawberry on top. we spilt that as a group and man it was perfect!!!!!!!!!!   good food, good service, good location!",

    "text": "The food was okay, not great. I ordered the terrace biscuit, and I love biscuits but in my opinion this was too much biscuit, I wish they would've used a more equal portion of biscuit and egg. My husband got the stuffed monte cristo, he also said it was only okay. Our little girl got the spice donut dunker, and she didn't eat it. It had way too much spice in my opinion. The coffee was good, and the waiters were excellent. We sat at the bar and everyone was super nice, me and my little one were drooling over the fruit, one of them handed us each one. I also liked how attentive the staff was there. However, my husband dropped me off at the front so I could reserve a seat, I was told you cannot reserve until your whole party is there, which I can understand. I stepped to the side and waited for my husband and daughter. Two minutes later, another woman walked in, and I don't know if it's because she was white but they were ready to seat her even though she had clearly said a party of 4 (she was alone). The hostess saw me glare at her and set the menus back down, then proceeded to tell her the same thing. Because of this reason we chose to sit at the bar, and because of this reason I will not be going back.",

    "text": "I've had this place bookmarked for a while now, and I finally decided to check it out with my wife. After seeing all of the glowing reviews, I thought it would be a sure hit. It wasn't.  There's tons of close, free parking in the attached garage, so that makes getting here very easy. You can expect quite a wait. Ours was 45 minutes to an hour. Since it was cold outside, most people waiting just lurked around the tables in the lower level, which would bother me if I were dining there. On the plus side, the outdoor waiting area had a nice propane heater, so we were able to wait, stay warm, and avoid lurking.  The decor is reminiscent of a late-90's hotel buffet eating area. Upstairs, where we were seated, features low-hanging pipes and unsightly, painted flexible ducting that is draped precariously over pipes. Not a great ambiance, methinks.  The food was good overall. I ordered the Crab Cakes Benedict, and my wife ordered the Canadian Bacon Benedict. She got a side of hashbrowns, and I got the cheese grits (upcharge). The eggs were perfectly cooked, and the English muffins, although they looked pretty thin, were very tasty. The cheese grits were good, but they were a little cold and were served in a tiny dish. Bummer.  I have to think that this place used to be something much, much better. At this point, most of the glowing reviews from a few years ago should be considered very, very misleading. Given all of the great brunch choices in CLT, I don't think I'll be back for a second visit any time soon.",

Half of our party's entrees were delicious- but half came out completely cold.  We finally gave up sending cold items back. What was going on in the kitchen?? Service was so slow I had to take mine to go in the end. Server was pleasant but slammed. Manager does not go out of his way to be particularly pleasant.

This is a cafe with a full bar.  Nothing fancy, but it is comfortable with a good menu.  The breakfast was basic with some nice spins.  I had a three egg, must have been small eggs at that, omelet with hash browns and toast.  Juice.  The omelet was just fine, but small and the hash-browns were outstanding rounds of crispiness on both sides.  Bravo!  The surprise spin was strawberry jam, which I first thought was a form of ketchup.  I don't like strawberry jam, but tried this guy and it was terrific.  Just mushed up strawberries with just enough lemon and sweetener to bring out their best.  I must say that I inhaled that jam on a piece of rye bread and it was like dessert.  The waitress, Melanie, told me that they have some other home made jams that they rotate each week or so.  Last week I missed blueberry mango.  Yes, I sure did.  My wife and I especially like their lunches.  Menu has great plates, salads and sandwiches and all meals have fried green tomatoes available.  Dinner menu is not too different from lunch, just a few other main plates.  Nice atmosphere, good for first dates, business meals and simply a place to get fed and have a few drinks...perhaps.  They do a good job and you will like the flatware, glassware and plates. You will see.",

    "text": "I came here with my wife and friends for a birthday brunch, which I thought would be amazing. Firstly, this place is extremely crowded. If we weren't happy to sit at the bar area, we would have had to wait 20-30 minutes to be seated.  When you get to your table, you will notice that all the silverware and bowls/plates are not pieces you can find in your local Macy's.  All the cutlery and bowls are designed to be very curved and give the feeling that you're about to eat in a fancy restaurant. The menu is fairly large and everything is pretty expensive but I ignored the prices and ordered the \"Shrimp and Grits\"  My Shrimp and Grits were spicy, mixed in with what I think were bacon bits, and had a few okras laid out on the top. While it was very unique in its flavors, the combination of spicy, okra-ey, shrimpy, bacon-et, and creamy left me oh-so-slightly nauseous.  I don't want to say it was bad in any way, but I did think it was made to \"wow\" guests rather than to actually be a delicious breakfast.  The past week I had just gone to a place in Davidson called Restaurant X which I thought was spectacular without trying too hard to be \"unique\" so I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed to pay more, and get a less pleasant experience.   On a side tangent, this is the only restaurant I have ever been to that has mouth-wash in its bathrooms.  I felt that the Terrace Cafe is trying too hard to be different, and not trying hard enough to make a delicious meal. It's crowded, a bit pricey, and too experimental to be delicious, and thus I can sadly only give Terrace Cafe only 3-stars for now.",

    "text": "Terrace Cafe is one of my favorite brunch spots in all of Charlotte! I have now been there multiple times all for brunch and I have never left with less than a belly full of delicious food!   My first time I tried Terrace Cafe a friend and I each got a beautiful latte. We shared the florentine eggs benedict and the special lemon poppyseed french toast. As a True lover of all types of eggs benedict, the florentine was very good. The lemon poppyseed french toast was really unique and tasty. It tasted almost like lemon poppy seed bread made into french toast. Very dense and filling, but perfect with the lemon sauce.   On my next visit I decided that it was time to accept that I have moved to the South and try the chicken and waffles... Let me just say I totally know why this is such a hit! It was absolutely AWESOME. A great combination of sweet and savory, I had to finish every last bite, because it was too good to leave on the plate. It came with a side of grits, which were buttery. To drink I got the french press coffee and a mimosa, but great additions to a wonderful meal. My friend got fried green tomatoes and the BEC Biscuit both of which were very tasty too.   The atmosphere at Terrace is very inviting, for such a popular restaurant they are able to keep the wait minimized for the most part and it is very worth it. I have had nothing but friendly staff and service. Not too needy, but plenty attentive. If you want breakfast/brunch this is your place. I promise you will not be disappointed. Maybe I will try lunch or dinner sometime, if it is anything like their breakfast I know I won't be disappointed.",

I always get the full breakfast: pancakes, cheesy grits, scrambled eggs and bacon.  It's a very high quality breakfast.  They use very good ingredients, I can tell.  The coffee here is high octane as well.    WARNING: if you dare try coming here on a weekend, make a reservation well in advance or you will NOT get it.  Ideally, if you can come in during the weekday, that's a much better move. Enjoy!!!",

The location is great because you can park in the deck and there is always parking. It is a smallish place, but they have some seating upstairs and a small bar as well.  I love the bloody mary here. The best anywhere. I love the hash browns and the red velvet waffle - OMG - to die for! Really good coffee drinks and great service.  The last time I went, some friends were in the area and wanted to join us, but we only had a table for 4. So we asked the server if we could add 3 more people and they moved the tables around to accommodate us, even though they were pretty busy at the time. I was really happy that they were able to do that, since I was visiting and wanted to be able to spend more time with my friends.  I have had dinner here as well and it has been awesome, but I keep coming back to the breakfast because it ROCKS!!!!  I wish they had these on the west coast!!!",

    "text": "Customer Service: My family and I have eaten at Terrace Cafe on many occasions, and never had the need to say anything negative about our experiences. We have always gone during the morning or early afternoon hours. On last Friday, (1-2-15) we ate at Terrace for dinner.   The cafe was mostly empty except for 3 other tables of patrons. My family placed our orders and my husband and I asked for \"sweet\" tea. First of all, the waitress took about 15 minutes to bring our drinks which I thought was very odd, considering there were so few patrons in the restaurant. When my husband and I tasted our tea, it was unsweetened!  Mind you, as I mentioned earlier, we have eaten at Terrace many times and have ordered their sweet tea most of those times. Each time, it has been appropriately sweet, even to the point of being too sweet.  This time however, the tea was definitely unsweetened. We told our waitress and she apologized and bought us out two more glasses of \"sweet\" tea. Again we tasted out tea and it was just like the first glasses, UNSWEETENED!!   This time, my husband walked to the front and told the waitress the tea was still unsweetened. 10 minutes later she comes to our table and says, \" I'm sorry but I don't understand, I usually don't drink tea but I tasted the tea and thought it was sweet and my co-worker tasted the tea and she also thought it was sweet!  Are you kidding me!!!!! So what she was really trying to say is that there must be something wrong with our taste buds because we, the employees think it's sweet!! Mind you, I have tasted Terrace's \"sweet\" tea and it has always been appropriately sweet! I ended up canceling my drink order and just drank water.  So, here are my comments  to this situation:   Firstly, as your patron, please don't insult my intelligence by putting the burden of proof on the customer. In this situation, the customer is ALWAYS right! (Customer Service 101).  Secondly, The manager on duty usually comes to the patrons table whenever there is a dispute or misunderstanding of some type with the patron. The manager on duty never approached our table.  Thirdly, repeat customers are bred as a result of repeat positive customer experiences, even during challenges.  Finally, My family and I initially went to The Cheesecake Factory for dinner but had to wait 1 1/2 hours for a table. This was the reason for our dinner trip to Terrace. Terrace is known for it's long lines during breakfast hours but I wonder why there was hardly anyone there during dinner hours???? Hmmmmmm just an observation!!",

When we arrived it was really busy, but the hostess said 30mins and in 30mins we were seated.  Unfortunately, our entire party was not there and they won't seat you unless everyone is there. However, since we were starving we sat without the missing people, but the staff was very accommodating to allow our remaining friends to seat at the table next to us once they arrived.  All in all, this is a great place with amazing food!",

    "text": "So, it's a Saturday morning and I'm in the kitchen making over-easy eggs accompanied by toast, baby tomatoes and fresh basil and my boyfriend in the living room says, \"you're cooking? I thought we could go to brunch.\" Oh... okay. I never say no to brunch so stopped in my tracks and plated the \"breakfast appetizers,\" considering it a good idea since any good breakfast place in Charlotte seems to have a 20-30 minutes wait.  I was right. We drove down to South Park and put our name in (30 minute wait, as anticipated) and decided to do a little shopping at the Container Store while we waited. We're getting pretty good at fitting errands into dining based on location. Anyway, once 25-30 minutes had gone by we headed back to Terrace, where the hostess was ready to take us to our table. Perfect timing! We were seated upstairs overlooking the restaurant and ordered coffee and fresh orange juice. I had the shrimp and grits (I'm becoming quite the southerner) and we shared a side of the red velvet waffles... OMG. Both were so amazing. I'm not even a waffle person when I brunch, but these were stellar. Also, give me something cajun with a side of okra and I'm a happy girl- big fan of Terrace's shrimp and grits. I left full but surprisingly not feeling TOO full- we still had a lot of errands to run that day. Oh, Saturdays!",

I ordered the infamous red velvet waffles.  They were a little too sweet for my taste, but good.   The atmosphere was homely feeling. It was small, quaint, and nicely decorated.   I would recommend this place for breakfast or brunch. If I'm in the area again, I would revisit this place.",

    "text": "We had dinner here last Saturday night. Couldn't decide what we wanted to eat and saw an add for them in Southpark magazine. Oh what the heck.. The place is rather unassuming from the outside. We arrived at around 6:30, and I would say around 40% full. The wait staff is very friendly. The first thing that grabbed my eye, was their wine list. The prices are very competitve! We had a nice bottle of pinot for $38! I saw an Italian wine on the menu that I paid $130 2 weeeks ago, and it was going for $75. On to the food,,, the menu was quite good and the thing that impresses is that all the food is organic and humane. Big plus! I had a chicken dish that was very tasty. My wife had a tender loin with a jalepeno sauce that was just right and not overpowering. I enjoyed our dining experience and would return definetely! A couple of things,,, lights are a little bright for dinner and they need some type of background music. The atmosphere was some what generic. They have a big breakfast and lunch crowd, so will be curious how they will compete in Piedmont Row(especially with George's opening up)",

    "text": "Sunday brunch -- First of all, I've tried many a bloody mary in various restaurants and bars in charlotte and I must say, theirs is by far the best I've had!  So, I'll be back just for another one of those!!!  About the food, we ordered the veggie egg white omelet served with fruit.  The omelet was pretty good but I have had better.  However, I always order a side of salsa to go with the omelet and their salsa was yummy.  So, I'd recommend adding the salsa to give the omelet a bit more flavor!  The fried green tomatoes are average.  My friend ordered the steak and eggs and declared that steak was delicious.  Coffee drinks were a big hit at our table as well.  The service was ok...they made a couple mistakes but nothing that wasn't fixed quickly.  I'll definitely be back.  There's more I want to try on their menu!",
