They offer a great, simple Chinese meal experience at great lunch prices, and everything is served quickly so I can get in and out within my lunch hour.    Although the restaurant doesn't have much of a \"Chinese\" feel, it's modern and clean, so it's great for dining with friends,colleagues, or kids, but not so great for a romantic or intimate atmosphere.     The only downside is that I leave stuffed and then feel like I need to go back to work and take a nap. :)",

One of the severs say us in the main dining while another was prepping prepping peas at one of the other tables - clue number one. A server finally came over after seven or eight minutes to take our drink order. We placed our appetizer order that took over twenty minutes to get there. We ordered bbq ribs that were almost impossible to eat. Super dry and very tough not to mention no sauce on them  at all. Our meals came out around ten minutes later with no rice (showed up much later). I ran out of iced tea and try to get the attention of our server who had returned to picking peas and texting on her phone. I mean really, what a joke. We will certainly never be going back here again.",

Their Crispy Scallion Chicken dish is our absolute favorite but everything we've ever tried on the menu has been delicious. The veggie Lo Mein and pork Lo Mein in particular are great. As for appetizers,  their dumplings,  spring rolls and calamari have all been good. We don't always necessarily order appetizers so I haven't tried that many items off the appetizer menu..but what we have had has never disappointed us.   Service is good and attentive - they don't hover around you too much so that you get your privacy (which is something I always appreciate when dining out and trying to have a conversation) but they make sure they are always close enough to serve you when you need them. Food comes out quite quick and it's always super fresh. Prices are very reasonable considering the size of the dishes - we always leave with a box of leftovers because the dishes are so big, which makes for yummy next day snacking:)  We've tried two different locations - the University City one and the one at Mallard Creek - and I must say that though both have been good, the Lengs in University City is better. Definitely a go-to place for spicy(ish) chinese style chicken!",

It didn't seem like actual meat at all. it was the worst. My nephew likes the sesame chicken but he likes everything. the sauce for it is good so i usually have some of that over some white rice. Would give 1 star but i do remember them being really good. I dont know what happened.",

I ordered the Shrimp with broccoli and it had 3 shrimp in it.  I'm afraid they have gone the way of so many places that sacrifice quality for economy .

I expected some yummy spicy chili dish--- i also ordered seafood dumplings - LAME! They were rubbery and just a piece of shrimp inside. I was thinking like a medley of seafood, ya know?  my friend ordered general tso chicken- sauce was thick and dark, not what our ideas of this dish would be. Eggrolls? Terrible. Way too expensive for being unsatisfied, 40$ for two bites. Nope! That was my first and last time.",

The portions are a good size, and I've never had a problem with requesting slight changes to my meal if I wanted (more sauce, add spice, no onions, etc).

As part of the larger shopping center, you can easily end up with a decent hike to get to the restaurant.  They were able to easily accomodate our medium sized group with minimal notice. The service was reasonably quick but the food did take some time and didn't come out together. There was at least a five minute gap between the first plates coming out and my food coming out.  The food was pretty good, we had a fair mix in the group, I got the eggplant chicken and enjoyed it. The eggplant especially was well cooked. The portions were generous and each entree was about $7-$8.  The food is good but nothing special but for the price, the quality and quantity are tough to beat.",

The dining room is spacious, which meant that even on a Friday evening there were plenty of empty tables and we were seated immediately. All of the staff was very friendly and attentive, quick to refill drinks and frequently checking to make sure we didn't need anything. The food was quick to arrive, hot, and the flavor, while not super exciting, was nice enough. I do wish both entrees were less greasy. And none of the flavors really stood out as dominant in the Szechuan Twin Twist that I ordered, but I did appreciate that they had a number of dishes that included both chicken and shrimp.  All in all House of Leng was a positive experience when we were looking for a quick, casual, easy dinner out. Not the best Chinese I've had in CLT but certainly not the worst.",

They seem to have a team serving concept where different servers are assisting you, the problem is you have to flag them down for everything, refills, check, boxes, etc.  The staff is always friendly, they are trying their best, just need a little management intervention.",

While the food is very good, each time I've eaten in the restaurant they brought out our meals as they were ready, so everyone was not served at the same time. I asked about it and they said they bring it out as it is done so the food doesn't get cold. Very few dishes are finished at the same time in any restaurant, but it's normal to bring everything out at once, so I found this really odd. Overall, the service was just average, but the food is good enough for me to go back again.  So far, the dishes I've had that were very good are the twice cooked pork, garlic chicken and the Saigon noodles with chicken.",

The restaurant was clean and located in a nice outlet with lake in the back, just wish it had a lake view.   Great will come again if ever in town.",

I've got a \"go to\" Chinese spot about 5 miles in any direction from here but, didn't have the time today, so here is where I ended up.  Its right near the lake, along with Ciro's, Zapata's, Boardwalk Billy's.  The decor is nice but, nothing special.  They have some booths and some tables.  I was promptly seated in a pretty much empty restaurant in one of the booths.  My waiter was quick and polite.  I wasn't extremely thrilled to not see a single meal for under $6 and that they didn't come with soup.  What can I say, I'm spoiled.  I went with the beef and broccoli.  It came out within 5 minutes.  The broccoli was barely cooked but I liked it.  The little pieces of beef were in a brown sauce that was quite salty.  My egg roll was leaking a Valdez style pool of oil in this over-salted sauce.  I've seen this before, when the egg roll has a whole and it and it just soaks up the oil.  My waiter was quite attentive but, nothing was going to save this meal.  If in a hurry, you can grab a decent bite for under $10 for lunch.  But, as soon as I left I saw that Zapata's has a $6.99 lunch special including drink next door, Ciro's is good Italian food, and of course if you really want Asian there's always Thai House across the street.",

Going to the location on mallard creek has never been a problem, but here we go At 1st glance I though the place was packed it wasn't we were quickly seated and our order was taken we start noticing people coming in and then leaving couldn't figure out why but maybe it was because they said they were out of chicken wings! But that continued for 45mins then we noticed snow peas all over one table as if they were being cleaned or something. Then we noticed people coming for there pk up orders and waiting just as long as we were sitting. And lastly my food came and I was amazed at how it looked at smelled until I dug in. I ordered house special chow fun w/chicken shrimp and beef snow peas, bean sprouts. What I thought was an abundance of chicken was wonton noodles tossed in.  So ridiculous we just paid our bill and left SAD!",

Now that our visits to Atlanta have decreased, I really long for Chou Lee's Mongolian Tofu.  Well, I think I have a local fave to satiate my cravings...House of Leng - University.  Although the dish does not come with the broccoli, scallions and onions served at Chou Lee's, it's pretty close ($2 charged for the  extra veggies).  The servers are consistently attentive and pleasant - never had a bad experience.  Add to the fact the portions are large enough for leftovers later, this restaurant is worth the trip.  Visit H.O.L. when you want a fast casual dinner and maybe with a cocktail to boot.  If you have last minute guests, their takeout is way better than your local pizza delivery - and I cannot count the times H.O.L. has come through on a weekday night.  Enjoy the food, service and drinks - and you surely won't be hungry two hours later  (serious myth lol).",

It was so hard we could barely chew it. Needless to say, we did not eat it all.  My issues are:  1. The owner is always trying to nickel and dime us- if we ask for sauce it's an additional cost. The waitress tonight said it was a dollar extra. Ok, no problem. The bill came it was two. We asked about it, and she said I'll take it off. We heard her ask the owner if the sauce was $1 or $2. She came back, placed the bill on the table, and walked away. We checked the bill, and the $2 was still there. We asked her about it, her response was... \"oh, I just said I was going to ask about it.\" Okbecause we didn't hear you clearly say that you would take it off!   2. If you order the fried rice and eat in the restaurant the serving is much bigger than if you order it to go! We absolutely tested this out.  There are few other minor issues but, I digress.  We were already teetering on whether or not to patronize this business again. Tonight confirmed that we will not return.",

It was a rainy day, so I appreciated that I could order it through Postmates really easily.  House of Leng was fast, good values for the lunch specials, and was pretty tasty. My friends and I want to give a special shout out to the chicken wings, which are fried and delicious! The fried rice was pretty good but a little salty. The shrimp and chicken with broccoli was also pretty good. I liked that it had a little spice to it without me asking to give it some spice. It was a bit salty, but it worked better with that dish than the fried rice. With the lunch specials you also get the choice of an egg roll or spring roll. The egg roll was good.",

The sauce sets House of Leng apart.  The inside is pretty spacious and always clean. The service here has never been anything but friendly. The recipes here come from a family who has been doing it for 20+ years. I was introduced to House of Leng a few years ago by family friends and they refuse to go anywhere else for Chinese.  This is a pretty convenient location near the UNCC area and located at the boardwalk in university area. Be prepared to shell out more than your typical take out prices, but it's very reasonable. The portion sizes for dinner are too much for one person, so prepare to have  leftovers.   5 stars for quality food and excellent service.",

I have tried many places but after being over charged for the quantity ordered, having an upset stomach from food poisoning, and general concerns of cleanliness of establishment I had all but given up on Chinese take out in my area.   While House of Leng is in the university city area (about 20 minutes away) I frequent the area visiting friends and other stores, which is how I found this establishment. I have been twice in the span of a week and ordered chicken fried rice both times - the second time because I enjoyed it so much the first time. They give you large portions for a very reasonable price and they are large enough to share with family and even save for lunch the next day. I can't wait to go back to try a couple more items from their menu! They have my business!",

We relocated a few years ago so the only time I would get my favorite Chinese food was when my husband had to come to Charlotte for work and he would bring back my favorite dish. Even though we had moved, I still always praised House of Leng and no other Chinese restaurant could compare. Unfortunately, my heart was broken this weekend. . While in town for a day, there was no doubt where we would have dinner. Needless to say, we were VERY disappointed. The service was awful. I had to walk to the kitchen to ask for serving utensils and plates, we had to ask for more soda and the food tasted like there had been a kitchen fire. The food tasted like smoke. This was fried rice and wings. I don't know if something happened at this location or if both locations have gone through changes, but we won't be going to this one again. I'm so sad.",

I guess they made a new batch (we didn't get ours until we almost got our check). My boyfriend had the eggplant with garlic and the flavor was off. The eggplant was not cooked very well. Last week I came back to pick up food for my mom's birthday. I ordered the crispy scallion beef. Although it is supposed to be crispy, this beef might as well been jerky. I had to knaw at it just to swallow. The flavor was great but this beef was burned bad. The chicken with cashews was oily. Unfortunately I will be finding another place to get Chinese food.",

The lunch  prices are decent for all that's included. The dinner prices not so much.   While they are the best choice for Chinese in the area with great service and fresh veggies, their food is often too salty and heavy on the sauce.  Dishes that most places serve sauteed (like the aforementioned) they serve fried which isn't necessarily desirable for a moderately healthy option.   The interior is always clean and the staff are always pleasant, attentive and prompt. It's a great option for a quick lunch with a few specifications (i.e. Sauce in the side, not fried, etc).   Still hankering for a go to Chinese restaurant in the area. Hopefully I'll stumble across a great one soon. For now I'll settle for House of Leng.",

Decent but not that impressive. I ordered delivery and while it took quite a while to arrive the food arrived hot and fresh. We ordered the chicken and eggplant in garlic sauce, egg drop soup, and general chicken. Assuming that \"general chicken\" meant General Tsos chicken might have been the wrong thing to do since it didn't taste or resemble Tso's. It did however come spattered with mushrooms, peppers and broccoli which was a welcome difference. The bits of chicken tasted alright but I'm not sure this would be a regular dish for me if I found myself returning to HoL. The chicken and eggplant in garlic sauce was definitely the best thing we ordered. tender chicken and luscious eggplant in a very flavorful sauce, though not the best version of this dish I've had, still pretty great for Charlotte. The fried rice at least had some egg and veggies in it though it didn't taste very fresh and the egg drop soup was just ok. Overall a decent output of food compared to similar spots in town but I regret to say that the search for my go-to Chinese restaurant continues.",

However, every protein-based dish either myself or someone eating with me has tried has been super bland or nasty. I've personally had the sesame tofu and scallion tofu. Both of these items tasted the same, and the scallion tofu didn't actually contain scallions. I wouldn't be able to distinguish the two dishes despite the pretty significant price difference. My partner tried the spicy orange chicken and said it wasn't spicy and had no flavor at all. He also took a bite and got a big piece of old, chewy orange rind that ruined his appetite. So, this place is alright if you order the right things, but that's not a game I like to play when ordering takeout.",

I went to Yelp, searched Singapore Noodles and this was the closest option!  I also had a coupon.... so it was a no-brainer!  This place is in the boardwalk in University.  We have been to the Mallard location once, which is a little nicer, but this location was much bigger.  The first floor has large booths and tables, the second floor is all tables.  Service is pretty attentive and they seem to be on a teamwork serving rotation so most servers can help you with what you may need.  We liked both our appetizer (steamed dumplings) as well as our meals (we both got the Singapore noodles with chicken).  Huge bang for your buck- 8.50 for a TON of food.  One star taken away for the chaos of the restaurant... it was a little loud.We will be back!",

Came here with friends for a quick lunch during work hours and they did not disappoint. Chinese food cooks quickly anyway but I'm convinced they must have woks searing food in 3000 degree flames! Our food came out piping hot 3 minutes after we ordered - and that's during the lunch peak with a packed house! If you're on a time crunch, come through.   The menu is larger than most places. So many options and even a few photos for those who eat with their eyes. It's not an authentic Chinese spot but with such a large menu, I was secretly hoping they'd at least have a few authentic dishes. Oh well.   Onto the food!  We had shrimp fried rice, beef and broccoli and chicken Singaporean noodles (mei fun) I must say - the mei fun here is extraordinary. The curry flavor is strong without overpowering the noodles and veggies which were cooked perfectly. And the portion is huge enough to share with the table. The shrimp fried rice was ok. I didn't order It but had a taste and It was pretty standard. The beef and broccoli was a hit. The broccoli was cooked just enough to take off the raw bite but not so much that you lose the crunchy texture. There's nothing worse than soggy broccoli. Their brown sauce is unlike anything I've had before. It was so savory and had an umami type essence - MSG perhaps? I'm not opposed to MSG so it's fine with me. The egg roll was also delicious. Fried crunchy on the outside and filled with cabbage and diced pork. I hate getting one rice grain sized piece of meat in my egg rolls - this place packs the meat in. Lovely!   My only gripe is with the condiments. You'd think with egg rolls, they'd either have sauce on the table or give you sauce with it. It's like getting fries - ketchup must be available. But no, we had to ask for it. Even then, they came out with ONE tiny bowl of duck sauce for three people who each had an egg roll. Come on now. We asked for chili oil and were given the same amount. We asked for more of both sauces and was given the same amount again - we asked for more a third time and again, the same amount. Really? Just bring us some sauces!!!!  One star off for that. I mean, they gave us sauces each time we asked but the second time, we made It clear we're saucy people (pun intended) but they made no change to their portion. We would've asked a fourth time but the servers didn't seem too happy.   Overall, we'll definitely go back but will make sure to ask for FIVE portions of sauce beforehand.",

This afternoon I visited the House of Leng At Boardwalk for the very first and last time.  Upon arrival the restaurant was not very busy and we were seated immediately, but it all got worse from there as they were incredibly understaffed.    After ordering we waited in excess of 45 minutes for our food to come out.  When the meals were finally ready, they were not delivered to the table at the same time, as my meal was brought out almost a full 5 minutes prior to my fiance's meal.  The food was not awful, but it was definitely sub par, and the lunch portion was smaller than I've ever received at any Chinese restaurant.  Upon finishing our meals, we waited another 10+ minutes for a check before finally being required to get up and hunt down our server to get the bill so we could finally complete what ended up being more than a 90 minute lunch.",

The decor and atmosphere is modern and clean and it is a good size restaurant for their business volume and it is in very convenient location to a lot of offices and homes. Now for some of my wife and my favorite dishes. The pork lo mein is good but has some faults. There are no bean sprouts and it has a little too much brown sauce, but the pork was the southern style sweet \"choshu\" - delicious. The sesame tofu is excellent. This dish is fried tofu cubes with a sesame brown sauce over it. We order it with the sauce on the side because the tofu comes straight out the deep fryer beautifully crispy. If you do not order it with the sauce on the side they drown it in sauce destroying the crispiness and the sauce is overpowering. Another winner is the \"house special\" soup appetizer for two which has whipped egg whites floating in it. I have has the chow fun in the past and it was very good. Also their crispy scallop dish is very good as well. Most of their dishes have the same brown sauce as a key ingredient, which wont annoy most patrons because most wont be ordering 10 plates of food to entertain a large party with variety. Again, the strength here is that the quality is consistent and the ingredients fresh and the taste is good to excellent on average.",

    "text": "Best Chinese food Ive ever had. My mom refuses to eat Chinese, says it all tastes the same and for the most part I agree with her but their food is good quality and you can taste the flavors. Well worth the drive to pick up since they dont deliver. **Disclaimer**Dont order the crab rangoons...at close to $1 a piece, they are a HUGE rip off. Nothing but wrapper, basically no cream cheese filling and no sweet and sour sauce comes with them. Id have given 5 stars if the rangoons were good.",

Leng is my go-to spot for chinese food when I'm in the area. They have all of the traditional dishes and some you won't find at other restaurants. Worth checking out.",

The service is always very good and the food takes only a few minutes to come out.   The atmosphere is lacking that oriental feel but I have no complaints regarding its modern styling ques; Very open and inviting.   Overall, its a great place that I enjoy time and time again!",

Every place I have been gives you two spring rolls for $1.50. Here they charge the same but for only one. The food was fast but that's about to it. I would certainly look elsewhere.

And not only did we not receive our appetizer at all, the General Tso's was spicy and there was no second plate that we asked for. The food was ok nothing spectacular. It tastes like they cooked the chicken over an open flame. It was kind of charred. Needless to say it was a bad first experience and I will not return.",
