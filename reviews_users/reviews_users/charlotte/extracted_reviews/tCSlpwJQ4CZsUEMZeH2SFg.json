    "text": "Delicious fresh prepared food with a French flair. Walking through the door one forgets they are in a suburban strip mall surrounded by chain steak houses and the mall. Cafe Monte is as close as you can get to an authentic French cafe in the queen city.   Our table ate:  1. Smoked ham crepes. Perfection with a generous dollop of cream.  2. Kids crepes with nutella and strawberries. Um, can't go wrong with chocolate and strawberries.  3. French country breakfast. Includes hash brown, sausage, toast, eggs. Traditional fare, but with flair.  4. Eggs benedict - this also included the hash browns and eggs were poached to perfection.  Food was delivered within 5 minutes of ordering on a busy Sunday, service was always there with water and coffee refills.  This is a gem of a brunch spot. Can't wait to try their lunch menu.",

The service was terrible. I asked to tell me what most people (regulars) ordered when dining there.  He replied \"steak, chicken, fish.\". I said I wanted to know what items the ordered from the menu.  He pointed to the Trout.  What a jerk.  He brought my dish, which came 5 minutes after I ordered & was not very appetizing in presentation or taste.  I ordered the wild mushroom & chicken crepes... Not good.  I left him a 10% tip which was over tipping.  Wish I had gone to PF Changs instead.  Beautiful city however, I wish I was staying longer.",

I like Cafe Monte.  Why? Because they fed me some excellent eggs.  We had been wanting to try Cafe Monte for quite a while, and once we discovered that they were in our Citipass (the best $25 you can spend, btw), we decided to give them a go for a late Saturday morning breakfast.  The restaurant's space itself is beautiful.  It has a turn-of-the-century Paris vibe that really sets the mood for the food.  Our waiter was helpful and polite in an unobtrusive way that seemed peculiarly French.  Mind you, I've never been to France, so that's a statement of instinct.  Let me not forget the food, for it was delicious.  I ordered the Benedict Monte, with two beautifully poached, wispy eggs, ham, tomato, asparagus, potatoes, and Hollandaise sauce, served with a croissant.  It was fabulous.    Though our Citipass voucher is now spent, we will return to Cafe Monte at full price with no hesitation at all.",

On our first trip there for dinner my wife and I were first taken by the openness and decor of the restaurant and as we looked around you could slowly begin to hear the music playing in the background. \"We need to come back here again,\" was our first reaction before we even tried the food.   I had the steak and frites and they were incredible. An even better reason for coming back again.   We tried brunch on Sunday morning recently and instead of waiting the 10 - 15 minutes we decided to sit at the marble topped bar and enjoy the morning. Again a phenomenal time and we had a chance of discovering a different part of the restaurant and the time someone had taken to try to make it feel warm, inviting, and almost cozy. They succeeded.",

Excellent experience, would recommend.",

This place used to be great for brunch, but you can tell the owners have really allowed it to settle into mediocrity. They have also botched two take-out orders recently - made me wait 45 minutes once and completely messed up the second time.  Also, don't get the lobster salad - made a family member sick for two days.  Avoid and go elsewhere for brunch.",

I was immediately impressed by the atmosphere - it feels like a French cafe complete with a pastry case, and it was great for lounging and slowly waking up on a Sunday morning.  We got the Benedict Monte, which was delicious on a croissant instead of the traditional English muffin, and the French Country Breakfast, which the chef very nicely substituted egg whites for the eggs.  The coffee was delicious, and the service was friendly.  The $30 price tag was a little more than some breakfast/brunch places, but it was definitely worth it!  We'll definitely be back.",

I can honestly say the entire evening was flawless, which is a testament to the caliber of people that work at Cafe Monte. In fact, many wedding guests came back to Cafe Monte for brunch the day after the wedding. I highly recommend Cafe Monte for large dinners/group events: the food and wine, service, and atmosphere are all top notch.",

    "text": "I went there earlier this week expecting to be wowed. I was left feeling underwhelmed and a bit upset. Being a new transplant to the Charlotte area I've looked to groupon and yelp as a way to explore my new city and find new gems. Based on the reviews here I jumped at the chance when groupon offered a deal a few months back. Anyone who knows me knows that I'm a francophile...french food is my weakness.   I chose 4:30 on a Wednesday so I could beat the dinner rush and just enjoy some quiet time by myself with my Kindle. I was the only table there so my waiter wasn't busy. He slammed the menu down and disappeared. No nice greeting, no specials, were given. Five minutes later he comes back and asks am I ready to order? I asked for wine recommendations...none were given, he instead gave me the wine list and left again. Cam back a few minutes later...I ordered my glass of wine, starter and main. Five minutes later he brought the soup and none of the oft praised bread was offered. Disappears, never checked on me.   Half way thru my soup the entree was dropped off. Never checked on. Are you getting the picture? The place was empty, what was his excuse for such poor service? At this point I'm livid. The soup was meh but my entree of Chicken With Mushrooms crepe was pretty yummy. I knew I should have just called it quits but I'm a sucker for creme brulee. Big mistake. It was flavorless, thick and had this weird pasty taste and mouth feel. I thought that was the final insult but no...there's more. Not only did the waiter not look me in the eye and thank me for my visit...he reached from behind me and dropped the check over my shoulder. WOW! I was pissed...I debated asking for a manager but at this point I was just over it and said screw it. Why bother? Just never come back and leave it at that. I'm not sure why I was treated so poorly. I was an easy table, an easy 20% tip for the waiter even though he was a douche. I've worked in the service industry so I tip well even if the service is crappy. All I wanted was a nice afternoon out by myself.",

Right here in Charlotte!!! I finally made it to Cafe Monte one Sunday for Brunch and the place was full of people!!! I was alive when I walked in. Really reminded me of a Bistro in Paris. I waited for close to an hour for my table, which is reasonable on a busy Sunday afternoon with no reservation. After being seated, my only complaint was that I wasn't getting good natural lighting for food pictures lol! I had coffee to start, the Cafe Au Lait (I think). Wasn't all that thrilling. Anyway, I ordered the Waffle with flambeed bananas, bacon, and of course frites! Everything was good. The bacon (which I call a gateway meat seeing that I don't eat pork) was marvelous! My guest had the quiche. She thought it was a little overcooked. Our waitor wasn't the most attentive, but other than that, we really enjoyed this place. Hope to get back soon!",

Not only was the hostess rude and uncaring but the food took forever to arrive and was lackluster when it did. The bland omelettes needed salt/pepper badly but we couldn't seem to get any. The coffee tasted like stale diner coffee. It was just an awful experience overall. I don't expect to be treated specially with an infant but do expect some basic understanding.   When I told the hostess my babies hands were ice cold outdoors and we really could use an indoor table, I was told we would now be at the end of the wait list (which was now 45 mins long). No \"I'm sorry mam\", straight face, inconsiderate tone. She was also unfriendly to my husband when he initially approached her for a table.   My suggestion- dine elsewhere. For $14 an omelette it felt like highway robbery.   Update: the owner was very prompt in responding to our negative experience and offered for us to come try cafe Monte again. We certainly will, as we had heard great things. His attitude was professional and apology sincere. I was impressed with the communication and it assured me our experience wasn't typical.",

I ordered the chicken and wild mushroom crepes as well as the banana flambe crepes. Both tasted absolutely amazing! The banana flambe wasn't that sweet either which is a good thing. The prices aren't too bad, but I do think it's worth it for how delicious the food is.  The customer service was alright. I made a reservation at 1 on a Saturday and it was completely packed in there. When they seated us, they forgot to lay out the silverware. Our waitress seemed snobby and slightly rude at first, but she got much nicer afterwards. I don't know if it was a coincidence or not, but I felt like they didn't pay attention to us as much as the other customers.   Parking was horrific. There wasn't a single space in front of the restaurant. I ended up parking near the movie theater. The walk wasn't too long, but it was extremely cold that day, so it was painful. And I ended up getting sick.",

It was too early for mimosas so we both went for an espresso.  It was yummy.  We both ordered the ham and egg stuffed crepes with some kind of heavenly cheese sauce.  For dessert we ordered beignets.  They were delish but I wish there was a cream dipping sauce instead of the jam.  The service was excellent and the environment was nice.",

We were a party of 2 and the snobby hostess wanted to seat us on the back wall bench seats between two tables that each had crying babies.  When my wife asked for a different table she huffed and puffed like it was a big inconvenience.  So she puts on on the other side of one of the tables full of kids.  Seriously?  There are plenty of other open tables.  We should have left at that point.  Waiter was terse, slow and never asked how our food was. Food ok.  All that and its $45 for 2 for breakfast.  I don't think so.",

Once again I was seated and waited about 25 minutes for the waitress to come to my table. She was neither pleasant nor attentive. When I asked for a water to go, she did not ask the other customer at the table if they would like one as well. She never asked us how our food was.

My wife had the french onion soup, which she also enjoyed. Overall, a great place for an anniversary dinner.",

This time I ordered the mussels and the duck confit.  Both were very disappointing.  The mussels came out in an unappealing cream sauce that I can very easily trump at home.  The duck confit was just so so and did not have much flavor.  How duck fried in duck fat isn't an explosion of flavor is beyond me.  I find the frozen duck confit from Reids to be much better.  I do have to give them credit for their starter bread, however.  It was fantastic and may be the bread that I've had in Charlotte.    Sorry Monte, but that's the last time that I will see a credit card charge with your name on it.",

The interior of the restaurant is clean, lively and very inviting; everyone seemed to be having a great time when we went.  The service was great and the waitress was very accommodating and didn't mind taking a few minutes to explain a couple of menu items for us.  I enjoyed the \"french country breakfast\" along with a side of french toast.  I must say, that Cafe Monte has some of the best french toast in Charlotte.  The french toast was crispy and golden on the outside and nice and soft in the middle, just the way I like it.  I washed my meal down with some very good french roast coffee, and I must say that this was some of the strongest coffee that I've ever had in my life, it was a real pleasure to drink such a beverage.  The best part of the meal was the check.  My two entrees (french country breakfast, coffee and french toast) totaled around $22 and it was totally worth it.  I don't recall what my frat brother had, but he really seemed to enjoy his meal too.  I recommend giving this place a try.  The lively atmosphere alone, makes the meal very enjoyable.",

I made it in closer to 1pm with my wife and started wavering on whether or not breakfast was the right call for sustenance. Cafe Monte was welcomed, despite my late rise.   I had heard whispers of this French cuisine in the quaint corners of Southpark...bistro music filling the art-laden walls. I was happy to find all of these. The interior is welcoming, spacious and occupied by very cushy chairs. I was enthralled with the music. Timeless and tasteful for the French decor.   I was a little put off by the host. We waited for a few minutes before anyone even acknowledged we were waiting to be seated. A minor faux pas that can be fixed for sure. The service, once seated, was fast and friendly.   I ordered the steak and eggs. A rather generous portion of sirloin, cooked medium rare, croissant, beautiful hash browns and eggs. My only hangup with this meal were my eggs. I had ordered them over medium and they were served waaaaay over hard. More along the lines of hard boiled. Rather displeased with the texture, but the rest of my plate made up for it. The steak is wonderfully cooked, flavorful and seasoned. The hash browns are served in a \"puck\" shape and need no ketchup.   The coffee is also delightful. Black, bold and piping hot.   I'd definitely venture back in to Cafe Monte. A few slight changes and they'll be a 4.5-5 star in my book! Oui!",

    "text": "I don't get to travel to Paris very often - okay, not at all - and all flights to Paris from here can be pretty costly, even if they're direct flights. But when I'm jonesing for un fixe Parisien (I made that up), I can't go wrong with Cafe Monte.   Portions are generous - I recently got an arugula salad with a pretty hearty serving of roasted chicken, with a massive side of berries - so you won't leave hungry. And don't forget to sample their pastries, with a delicious cup of fresh brewed coffee to go with it.   Love, love, love the decor and the atmosphere. Okay, so it's not really like the bistros that line the streets of Paris, but, what the hell, this is Charlotte, and this is as close to the City of Lights as some of us will ever get.   So don't whizz all over my dreams, okay?",

The owner was a fantastic person and even brought me a complimentary glass of wine to compliment the garlic butter of the escargot. Needless to say we have found a new IT place for special occasions and random cravings for French food and top notch customer service. I insist that you should give this restaurant a chance; you will leave very pleased.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I just checked out Cafe Monte for the first time. As soon as we walked in, I felt like I liked the place. Soft jazzy music playing, interesting art on the walls, lots of tiny bistro tables and a beautiful marble bar. Very French feeling, and I would imagine if you were visiting for dinner it would feel downright romantic. The wait for a table inside was about forty minutes so we opted to squeeze into two seats at the bar. We waited for almost fifteen minutes without anyone coming over to even get our drink order, and my boyfriend got seriously ancy at the wait. He finally went to talk to the hostess and after a few minutes the bartender came over to take our order. He seemed very nice and competent, so I would venture to say the issue was more of the restaurant being pretty majorly understaffed vs poor service from the bartender. I ordered a Bloody Mary and Ham & Egg Crepes and the bf went with Bananas Foster French Toast. The Bloody Mary was very good and tasted especially fresh. And the bartender seemed to have a very generous pour of the vodka which I always appreciate! Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time, and I couldn't have been more pleased with my crepes. The crepes themselves were perfectly thin and airy and filled with scrambled eggs and smoked ham. The best part was for sure the rich and creamy four cheese sauce drizzled over the top. Very toothsome. My boyfriend's meal, on the other hand, was not so great. For one, they brought him a plate of plain french toast instead of the bananas foster he had ordered. Since he was hesitant to send it back and wait even longer, he resigned himself to just eating what was in front of him. After a few bites, he put his fork down and described it as \"flavorless.\" I was skeptical that he was just in a complainey mood at this point, and tried a bite for myself, but he was right. \"Flavorless\" was a pretty accurate description. The bread was very visibly burnt and it tasted as though it has been quickly flipped in the egg batter and would have benefitted from more of a soak. I could taste a hit of cinnamon in the batter, but other than that there wasn't much going on in the flavor department. After awhile the bartender came to check on us and my bf mentioned he thought his order was missing the Bananas Foster componenet. The bartender studied his plate for a moment and agreed. He came back with a teapot full of the elusive Bananas Foster topping and suggested my boyfriend spoon it over the top. He left without giving him a spoon to do so with, which kind of drove my boyfriend over the top. His french toast was by now cold and he was just over being in the restaurant at this point and ready to go. Can't say I blame him. All in all, I really enjoyed my food and wasn't particularly bothered by the service hiccups. I would happily go back to try it again, but it's safe to say it will be a pretty tough sell to entice my boyfriend to return.",

The restaurant is very large but still intimate. The place is clean and the restrooms are lovely.   I didn't have any coffee but others claimed it that it wasn't very strong.   I ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. Very good. The eggs were properly cooked. I didn't care for the side of hash/potato at all. My meal was good but honestly, nothing wowed me. Others at my table ordered the french country breakfast and the seafood omelet with no complaints.   Overall, this restaurant wasn't too bad. Personally, I don't understand all of the hype. I would probably come back to try lunch but probably not breakfast. It could be a possibility that maybe my palette isn't refined enough to appreciate Cafe Monte but it is what it is.",

    "text": "When I  was first moving to the area, my realtor brought me to Cafe Monte for breakfast, and I remember a good experience. We sat inside, and I had the Eggs Benedict. Today went to lunch, and did have a reservation--my dining companion likes to eat outside.  Our reservation was for 1:00.  Our table was not ready and had to wait about fifteen minutes.  Another person showed up, and was seated right away at a table outside, they too must have had a reservation.  My guess is they were regulars, as the waiter seemed to know them, and spent a fair amount of time talking with them. Our waiter was very slow and seemed to spend a lot of time socializing with the regulars who were seated before us. We finally did give our drink order.  We have a running test, my girlfriend likes lime in her water, and we will always order, asking for lime--the test is if they actually listen and bring the lime or lemon--our waiter did not pass. My girlfriend had the Quiche Lorraine, and I had the Beef Short Rib Baguette, which is supposed to be their more popular sandwich.  The sandwich -- short rib, caramelized onions, provolone cheese and arugula.  I could not detect any onions, and the sandwich was too greasy for me--I couldn't finish it.  The quiche was very good, and my girlfriend finished her whole plate, which doesn't happen often, so you know it was good. Our waiter never did come around to ask how everything was, never asked if I wanted another drink, must have been too distracted talking with the regulars at the other table.  I was finally able to flag our waiter down to ask for our check.  The hostess didn't seem very friendly as well. I would think management or the owner realize that the hostess is the first impression and the wait staff represent the establishment.  The restaurant was not that busy, so I really can't understand the slow service.  Based on this experience, I don't think I'd go back.",

Normally, I am a little hesitant on fru fru French places as I don't like all the heavy sauces and cremes.  Today, I might have had the best egg white omelet ever. I told the server exactly what I wanted in it. It was elegantly presented on the plate and simply  delectable. They served it with a cup of fruit, some really good toasted bread, and a potato cake that looked like a muffin. Not sure where they got the strawberry jam from, but I need access to their strawberry patch!  I had to get a little extra, which was no problem.  My bread likes lots of jam.  /  Superb service, stunning atmosphere, and overall one of my best dining experiences yet.  Parking can be a bit challenging, so go there knowing that it might take a few circles around the parking lot to find a place.   Trust me, it's well worth the effort.   Two Thumbs up and then some.",

Can't remember the last time such a warm and embracing smile greeted us at a podium.  We were there for a long lingering supper and after a moment or two, Alex knew exactly what we wanted.  He brought a sip from which we selected the night's special red, hot \"crusty-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside\" French bread and European cultured butter as only the French serve.  We selected the 4-cheese fondue which we lapped up to the very end.  My only suggestion is it could have used a little more gruyere or something to give it a tad more zip.  Our salmon was better than we could have done ourselves - and probably a better grade, as well.  We finished with the lemon curd tart: a perfect end to a wonderful evening.  I want to return, again, tonight, but Kate says she accepted an invitation to have to her sister's.  What I love about Cafe Monte is the ability to have what you want for as long as you want, or even to sit solo at the bar.  No place is nirvana to everyone, but Cafe Monte comes close.  If the young people would yank themselves away from their corporate chains just once, they'd learn to spend less on better food while supporting the local economy and our Charlotte families.  Cafe Monte sets the standard for quality, ambience, creativity and service.  It exemplifies how horrid the corporate chain restaurant is.",

    "text": "Great french restaurant in SouthPark (in the building next to Whole Foods)! I was in town due to Hurricane Irma and staying in the new Homewood Suites hotel across the street.   The location is great with plenty of parking. They have outdoor seating as well for the beautiful weather lately. I came in early Saturday and it was definitely busy with a 45 minute wait. Thankfully, the bar seating is first come first serve and there were two seats available.   The service was excellent and the food was just amazing. I had a delicious almond latte and mimosas with my meal. We ordered the rib sandwich and baguette with various butter and jam. Everything was so good! I came in a few days later and also tried the waffle and fresh berries. It was great!   There are so many great selections! This is a great place for brunch, business meetings, or just some time to catch-up with family and friends. I look forward to visiting again!",

While cafe monte had a quaint atmosphere and charming staff, their lack of flavor will keep me from going back. The poached eggs were over cooked, the hollandaise sauce was bland, however, the beignet was light and fluffy. If you want a cup of coffee and a French beignet-this is the place for you! Just stay away from their brunch options.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed my crab cakes benedict here and the shrimp crepes looked fabulous as well.  It was super-busy on a Friday at lunchtime with a 45-min wait!  Luckily I was able to snag some bar seats that you can seat yourself.  The lovely girl behind the bar was swamped as she was the only one working behind the bar at that time taking care of 20 customers at the counter, plus walk-up/take-out customers as well as making beverages for the table servers.  She took good care of us though and with a smile.  The restaurant itself is very tastefully decorated with some delicious breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner options.  I definitely would call ahead for reservations in the future and not chance the long wait.  The parking lot fills up very quickly as well, but there is parking at whole foods lot (if you're lucky) or around the Hampton Hotel or the other Phillips Place business.  There is a stair up to the restaurant from Phillips Place, so it's easy to get to if that's where you park.",

My lump crab salad was delish and my husband's risotto was perfectly cooked. It's not a \"cheap\" meal out, but you pay for quality - the place was definitely jam packed and proceeded to stay that way.... We ended the meal with the vanilla macarons and while quite pricey, they were fresh this time around (they were broken and semi-stale last time). Quality was by far improved - the only downside was the hostess who took awhile to see us and approached us while talking on the phone \"I will be right with you\" - felt a bit off but as noted, it all came together!",

We went for dinner,  around 8:00, and the place was busy but not packed. The prices are on the expensive side but not terribly expensive. It is a great place for a date or double date. It was supposed to be jazz night but I have not noticed live band, but heard jazz music pumping from the .   We started with cheese fondue which was great, not too sour and without aftertaste that grocery store bought fondue leaves.  The bread that accompanies the fondue was superb, wished we could take home some.    We ordered for our plat principal the shrimp risotto and the trout Amandine, both were flavorful and great. I was eyeing the crepes but decided for the trout,  and it didn't disappoint me; I will try the crepes next time.  As dessert we ordered the beignettes and came 6 BIG pieces,  enough for 3 to eat. With wine glasses and coffee our bill came out $78, which was worth it, but hoped it would be a little less than that.   Definitely returning in the near future for another meal!",

I ordered the smoked ham crepes.  I guess maybe I was expecting real ham and not diced deli quality ham.    The second thing is with the sauce, it was splattered all over the plate with no real quality to the presentation.  A real chef would have cleaned up the splatterings so it looked presentable.    And the last thing is that the dish really had no flavor to it.  It was all sort of bland.    Frankly, I've had better breakfasts at a chain restaurant.  Additionally water glasses often went unfilled.  Here's a suggestion, if you notice that people are drinking a lot of water, leave a pitcher on the table so they can refill themselves instead of having to wait for a server.

    "text": "I wanted to love this restaurant from the moment I walked in.  A Sunday brunch with friends let me experience the ambiance, delicious food, great pastries (thanks Amelie's), and rocking bloody mary's.  From this description alone you'd expect a 5 star rating, but with this restaurant it's the service which destroys it.  It often times feels like you're playing Russian Roulette with a 4 bullets loaded.  I just don't understand it.  The first time we went it was magical.  The second time we went (also with another couple) the service began to show its wear and tear.  All the other times were a toss up between amazing and atrocious with no indicators to give you advance warning.  The last straw for me came after a very difficult day in which my wife and I were hoping Cafe Monet could turn it around.  From the first impression we could tell the waitress would rather be having a root canal than take our order.  This wasn't the first time we'd encountered that look in Cafe Monte, but with an almost empty restaurant (we went in early) you think she'd want to milk every ounce of tip she could  Attitude dripped from her monologue and our lack of alcoholic drink orders brought a sigh to her lips.  All I wanted, nay... craved, was a chocolate croissant and an almond croissant warmed up.  This was the text book definition of a SIMPLE order.  I'll give you a second to figure out what happened next.  She screwed it up.  She gave me a chocolate croissant and then an almond chocolate croissant.  She didn't care less about the screw up.  After tasting the incorrect almond croissant I asked for the correct one to be brought out.  She snagged the plate and then disappeared.  Actually, most of the time she was disappeared which is an amazing feat for an empty restaurant.  When the correct croissant finally came out it was cold.  C'mon.... seriously?  I asked for it heated up and received barely lukewarm.  Suffice it say, my tip reflected her total lack of caring.  I'm done with this place.  If I want French I'll go to Georges Brasserie and if I want pastries then I'll go to Amelie's.",

So it took us a while to notice the place, but now that we love the place, my wife and I think that it's actually nice that not 'everybody' knows this place.  It's a really wonderful, pretty looking place with an awesome team of people who knows what service is. They know what they have and they know how to make what they have sound delicious. Most importantly, they were patient with us asking if we could get pictures or what the menu was.  And the food... I had the Duck Confit. It was great! I usually like the taste but dislike the aftertaste or the flavor some duck dish have. In this case, it was a hit. Out of the ball park! And how about the salmon my wife ordered. It was also delicious. Our drinks were fabulous as well.  Lastly, we were lucky and got to hear the wonderful band play some jazz music too. I felt like I was back in Europe. So if you like that kind of atmosphere, and if you like duck and seafood, go check it out. I promise, it won't disappoint.",

    "text": "We had a perfect Sunday brunch from start to finish!  I made the reservations via OpenTable on Saturday night for a 10am Sunday brunch, we woke up earlier than expected and hungry.  It was super easy to update my reservation to 9am using the app. We arrived just before 9am and were warmly welcomed by the hostess.  We were seated right away and our waiter brought us waters.  My husband ordered Benedict Monte and I got Crab Cake Benedict.  I don't like runny eggs so I asked for mine to poached medium-hard.  As surprising as is may be, it is rare for a restaurant to get my eggs right, but Cafe Monte poached them PERFECTLY.  I almost couldn't believe it.  My meal was absolutely divine.  And the small bite of my husband's was very good as well.  We completed the meal with a Nutella crepe and fresh strawberries. One word: YUM!   All the staff we encountered were pleasant, friendly, and helpful.  Our waiter was attentive without being annoying.  Our entire experience was fantastic.  We will be back.",

    "text": "Just tried Cafe Monte last Friday night and was pleasantly surprised! I usually \"pass\" on strip mall/shopping center restaurants (Yes, Philips Place, you are a shopping center), but you are truly in another place once you walk inside Cafe Monte. The ambiance is really intimate, but casual - live music in the front, dim lights (but not dark and creepy).   Our table was in the farrrrrr back corner, probably not my first choice - but they sat us for our reservation the second we walked in which is the way it should be! I love restaurants that are organized and know how to handle reservations!  Our waiter was sort of attentive and sort of nice - but everything else was so good, I can let that go. We had the Steak Frites and Salmon - both were really delish! Next time will probably skip the steak and go for the crepes and something from the appetizer menu. Maybe fondue?  The wine list had affordable options, their house white was a nice pinot grigio for 22 bucks. But, my favorite part of dinner was the chocolate mousse with fresh fruit for $6. Yum yum yum. My friend and I shared it and didn't even finish the whole thing (but we were also stuffed from dinner).   Cute place, would love to go back!",

It was extremely busy on Saturday, but we managed to find a place at the corner of the bar that was quiet and intimate.   We had several delicious small plates including a salad with strawberries, a cheese plate with a freshly baked baguette and the most amazing burger we've had. Our server even gave us complimentary glasses of champagne which accompanied our carrot cake. We would have tried the chocolate tart that  looked amazing but it had already sold out.   We would definitely return and highly recommend this restaurant.",

People who came in after us finished their meal before ours came out.  The sausage I ordered was ice cold.  Nothing more disgusting than cold meat.  I ordered no toast due to dietary issues, of course they pile toast on my plate.  I'm very sensitive to sugar.  My kid ordered fruit instead of fries... got fries of course.  When we complained, they bring over macaroons, which of course I cannot eat.  Nice thought with an equal amount of thoughtlessness.  Poor form today.  Gotta clean it up, or this might be the last time in.  Pay better attention to details.",

Zero exaggeration - the best French Onion soup I've tasted to date, and that's saying a lot. My bf had the french dip sandwich and it was perfectly cooked in every way. Hot with melted cheese and just the right amount of au jus. I had the banana flambe nutella crepes and they were excellent. They also had great looking pastries and every kind of coffee you could think of. Overall, great place with great service and great food. Will definitely be back!",

The french toast itself had 4 very huge and fluffy slices of brioche bread. It was airy and buttery and toasted just enough to get the crust hard, but soft in the middle. Very good for a simple french toast. I also got their coffee and it was delicious. It was a bit strong black, but with a little bit of milk it was perfect. I've noticed most of the customers are older ladies and I think the ambiance caters to that. Would love to come back and try an actual french dish.",

Even though there were only three other times in the place (so want to say joint but thought I would class it up a bit), our waiter seemed to be MIA most of the time.  You know what would make this place better? A little person who goes by the name of Monte walking around to each table in a striped shirt, beret and thick mustache while reading french poetry. Cmon, how can that not make you smile??",

It was as if the server was just going through the motions because he knew he was going to get the 18% tip that was added to every bill during restaurant week.   The food was very good however the portions were extremely small. There was a couple next to us who seemed to not order off the Restaurant week menu and for what I could tell the portions seemed larger. So they might have reduced portions for the special menu that week.  The escargot was amazing. The Caesar salad and tomato bisque was just okay. For an entree I got the Fillet Oscar which was cooked to perfection. I will definitely stop back and try it again during a normal time and hope for better service.",

I have been to Cafe Monte many times, but never reviewed because I did not use Yelp. However, since I use Yelp often to find reviews, and I am moving to NYC in 3 weeks and will be using Yelp A LOT, I thought it only fair to start contributing. So I headed to Cafe Monte with my main man, Dudley.  I sat outside at the little 2 person tables on the side of the building. It was very hot outside, but I am a summer fanatic. My server was very sweet and was a great balance between taking care of my needs and letting me do some work on my laptop and relax with my dog (free WiFi yay!).   I got there right at 3:30 and they had switched over to the dinner menu, but they still let me use my lunchtime groupon anyway. No guilt trip whatsoever about it! I ordered the Chicken Mushroom crepes and a side of the Gruyere scalloped potatoes. I have included pictures.  The crepes were so, so, so good. Most enjoyable was the yummy cream sauce as well as the TONS of mushrooms. I will be ordering a lot of mushroom dishes as they are my favorite food in the entire world. The chicken seemed as if it were pulled from the bone- very tender and flavorful. There were about 3 or 4 well stuffed crepes with chicken, 3 different kinds of mushrooms (that I could tell), and that delicious sauce.  The potatoes were not as amazing as I had hoped. They were very thick slices of russet type potatoes with a ton of butter and Gruyere cheese only on top. It would have been great if they had more cheese through the dish. They were ok, but I only ate a couple of bites.  They were so canine friendly! My waitress offered and promptly brought out a bowl of water for Dudley, which after he was done drinking, became his plate. Duds loved the crepes and potatoes, and for a dog he is somewhat picky, so that says something!  I love this place. So much good stuff, and on my next trip back, I will make it much earlier so I can do breakfast!",

The food is always great. We've never had anything we didn't like. And Shawn and Jenny are amazing waiters. If you can't get one, get the other.  Our family and friends are always impressed. And my mom recently said, \"it's refreshing to go to a restaurant where you feel like you are being served by a friend and that you are the only people that matter.\"  We honestly rather spend our special occasions with Shawn or Jenny than go anywhere else.",

Because let's be reasonable, when you're poor, $17 bucks for steak and eggs isn't exactly the most exciting thing to fork over your hard earned cash for. Delicious, but expensive.  In any case, I used to head over here for brunch on Sundays after a long morning at church or for a working lunch during the week and truly, there are some gems on the menu.  Their pommes frites are delightful, and an excellent complement to many of the sandwiches offered. I make sure they comprise some part of my meal every time. Salads, omelettes, etc. are all great options as well.  As for the dinner situation, I haven't been in the evening. It's just such a lovely little spot for breakfast or lunch.   There's a pastry case that looks fabulous and they have a full-service coffee bar. I usually just order regular, though.  Be warned, however, that there is generally always a wait around peak brunch times on the weekend.",

    "text": "Went to Cafe Monte after purchasing a groupon. Made a reservation for a Sat night and off we went for a little date.   Entered to a half full (at best) restaurant that gradually filled up over the time we were there. We were seated at a nice table that was up against a pillar so we didn't have to deal with being in the middle of the room (which I hate).   We were given a wine list and menus upon being seated. I am 5 months pregnant and it really shows at this point and the husband had given up drinking for Lent so we passed on the wines. This seemed to off-put the waiter a little but I let it slide b/c he was still nice enough. Felt like we were a little rushed to make decisions about what we wanted to order and when I asked for more time something about the demeanor of the waiter made me feel bad about it.   We ended up ordering a cheese plate and french onion soup to start. The cheese plate arrives at the table with no explanation as to what the various cheeses are. This really bothers me. There was a cheese that had, what I later asked about, mustard seeds inside of it that was very delicious, but even upon asking about what was in it, all I was given was the answer \"mustard seed\" and that it was the waiter's favorite cheese. Nothing else about it or the other 3 cheeses on the plate (which I equate to a brie, cheddar and goat). Frustrating.   My husband loved the french onion soup. I took a few bites and found it to be pretty tasty but am not much of a soup person and wasn't in the mood this night so that is all I can say about that.   For entrees I had the steak frites and husband had the flounder special. First let me say that the portion of steak I received was very large, which would have been fantastic, had it been fantastic, but at best I rate it as pretty good. The frites were nothing spectacular, but all seemed to disappear from my plate with no problem so I would def order those again.   Husband's meal came out looking like it was sitting in a stick of melted butter and had an overall greasy appearance. I don't eat fish, so I didn't try this but he later told me it was, in fact, greasy, but that after a few bites he was able to move it out of the drippings and then it actually had a good taste. Both entrees were served with green beans which I could take or leave. Nothing spectacular there.   Ended with an eclair and a coffee for the husband, both of which were enjoyed.   All in all it was a decent meal and I am happy that we went and gave it a try. Perhaps if we had been able to order drinks and wine it would have made the whole experience better, but that just wasn't in the cards right now.  I would like to give big props to the lady who kept my water glass filled until the minute we were getting up from the table! That truly made this thirsty pregnant lady happy.",

It is conveniently located near the mall and it has small dishes that are delicious and I'll be in budget. Great salads, French onion soup, quiche, and omlettes. My friend sat at the bar and ordered coffee and baguette stat. They delivered with a smile.",

One of my favorite entrees is the chicken and mushroom crepe. It's just delicious and creamy and full of flavor. I had a delicious cappuccino and eggs Benedict for brunch which was also delicious. The restaurant is a little unassuming from the outside, but the inside it adorable, with great big pictures of Europe and a cafe feel. Definitely would recommend to anyone!",

Management indicated they were closed at 9:45...despite the signage indicating the close time as 11:00. Not to mention we called ahead and the 11:00pm close time was indicated then as well. The manager was a complete JERK. He was condescending and rude. It was unbelievable!!! To add insult to injury after reluctantly and agitatedly giving us a gift card as we were walking out the manager stated \"just remember we close when we feel like it\" to which I responded \"so how will we know when we can come back?\" His response...\"you'll figure it out\". Unreal! Do not patron this business.",

I have been grabbing brunch, lunch and dinner here now for years. For brunch, I particularly love the Fruits de Mer omelette, which beautifully combines my two favorite foods, eggs and seafood (lobster, crab and smoked salmon, oh my!) For $15 dollars, you get a huge seafood packed omelette, fresh fruit, two pieces of delicious grainy bread, and a sand dollar sized hash brown.  I do order other things, but the Fruit de Mer omelette never ceases to delight.  The tomato bisque is another favorite of mine.  The French fries are also perfectly thin and crispy. They are almost too good to be True! And no meal is perfect without one of their exquisitely crafted cappuccinos. One of the best I have had!  It's been too long since I've had dinner there, so I leave you with my brunch recommendations until next time! The duck confit pizza is really calling my name.",

To make it really authentic you'd have to make it just a bit shabbier, with the faint smell of 100 years tobacco use, the tables crowded closer together, the bathroom fixtures 70 years old.... and of course charge 3.00 for a water.  But there you have it..... they can only do so much.  Ambiance was as French as the aforementioned would allow.  Service was fine.  Beers were great.  I had a burger (quelle horreur) but only because I had only two weeks in the States and was on a massive burger run.  It was OKish.   I should have ordered a French menu item.  I have to say the pizzas looked interesting.... if not very Franch.  I'll give them 3.5 stars and stop by again when I'm back in town and maybe order the herbed chicken crepes which sounded good.",

I was torn between the quiche Lorraine, lobster and shrimp crepes and crab cakes Benedict,  I went with the quiche Lorraine which was served with a side salad. I also ordered french onion soup. My niece went with the steak and eggs.My quiche was cooked perfectly and the soup was great as well. The steak that my niece ordered was very, very small looked like maybe under 3 oz.  Its a good thing that she is a small thing or else she would have certainly not been satisfied.  The service and atmosphere was nice. My only gripe is that the restaurant is relatively large and popular and they only have one restroom. There was a constant line. Other than that I really enjoyed our Sunday brunch and I will definitely return for those crepes.",

    "text": "Enter this bustling corner restaurant decorated in the theme of a French bistro and you will immediately be greeted by the lively music and friendly staff. If you are dining on a weekend you will most likely also be greeted a rather noisy establishment. The ambiance is usually mellow during the week if you are looking for a casual atmosphere.   If you are ordering wine I strongly recommend the La Posta Malbec. Why strongly? I don't like Malbec and my boyfriend doesn't like Malbec but one sip of my sister's glass was enough for us both to order our own glass.   Ever since the first time we ordered the four cheese fondue we decided to keep it as a staple item for our visits. The cheese has a delicious sharp undertone and the fondue is full of more cheese than will be absorbed by the bread they bring with it. They never seem to bring enough bread with it but we save the tableside bread they bring with dinner service to gluttonously leave no bite of cheese behind.  My previous favorite was the seared scallops over mushroom risotto but has since been replaced by the Beef Short Rib Bourguignonne which was phenomenal with a hearty cut of beef so tender no knife was needed. I will definitely be ordering this again!  This restaurant was close to a 5 star review but unfortunately on our last visit the beignets that I had absolutely raved over during a brunch visit came out as a burnt dessert. Hopefully on our next visit I will be able to update my review after a perfect dinner service.",

I loved the entire decor of the bar area and place in general. Not a sports bar, but plenty of TVs.

    "text": "We returned to Cafe Monte last night with a $18 for $30 Groupon deal. Of note, Wednesdays are half off bottles of wine at Cafe Monte. Also of note, other promotions are not valid when using a Groupon, limit one promotion per table. We still purchased a bottle of wine, a French Merlot, Nicholas for $34 at full price on top of the food covered by the groupon. We were seated right away, they had a good crowd going in the back of the restaurant. I guess it makes it easy on the servers. There were about 10-13 other tables dining at the same time. Our server, was ok, she should have mentioned the limit one deal per table much earlier than she did. We ordered the seasonal risotto with shrimp, $18, and the bf got the basil penne with chicken, $16.   I love the complimentary bread that's brought out at the beginning, it makes me want to buy a whole baguette before I leave. Very fresh and soft on the inside, yet perfectly crunchy on the outside, just the way a French baguette should be. I prefer Cafe Monte's baguettes over Amelie's . The food was brought out surprisingly fast, it was not the case last time we were here. My risotto was generously dressed with tender shrimp, loved it, and a copious amount of veggies. The zucchini and mushrooms came out perfectly. It had a balanced, creamy yet flavorful taste. It was a good sized portion, I only left a little risotto standing on the plate when I was done. The penne was also good, need a little more seasoning but it had a generous amount of chicken and pesto cream sauce. Bill came to $37 after the Groupon was applied due to the full priced wine bottle, eh, will keep the 1 promotion per table in mind for next time.   Remember to look for a Groupon/Living Social deal, it really helps considering the average price of a meal here. Oh, lunch/brunch menu all day on Sundays! Cheers!",

We ordered a Hendricks Martini and a glass of merlot which were quickly delivered. Once we got our drinks we ordered the rest of our meal. Escargot in puff pastry and Brie en croutes arrived, but only five minutes later our entrees arrived. We told the server we needed more time. About ten minutes later our entrees came back but my beef Wellington was medium well instead of medium rare when I cut it through. We sent it back and I had lobster and crab crepes which were delicious. We ate creme brulee which was yummy and brought home chocolate raspberry mousse cake. I'm looking forward to trying Cafe Monte again!",

He liked it.  Especially all the ladies that come in from shopping.  Yes, somethings never die!    Ordered crepes, which he liked.  Generous portion and we both like the rich, fresh coffee.  A real treat and rare find in local restaurants.  Service is excellent and just enough checking to refill coffee and to see if all is well without hovering.  Atmosphere is relaxing and comfortable.    Menu offers a nice mix of European/French fare along with fairly well-known meals.  A very nice place to have a relaxing meal.  This could be and excellent and safe first date place.  Ummmm.  Will be a regular over time.",

For the brunch I ordered a Charculerie Plat as a appetizer for all of us to share and with its assortment of cured meats, olives and patte it really hit the spot to start off with. For a main course I had the Parisian Omelette which came with a fruit cup for a side. The \"Parisian Omelete\" may sound kinda fancy but it's really just a ham and cheese omelete but since they prepared it with brie instead of american cheese I guess that made it a little more classy than usual. Either way, the omelete itself was well prepared and tasted as good as any omelete I've ever had. The fruit in the fruit cup was actually pretty fresh which is a big bonus for me since a lot of places seem to kinda fall short in that department.   Our group had a lot of people (I think 20 spread out between two tables) and the servers did a very good job of keeping up as well as the kitchen. My water was always topped off and I never felt either neglected or overly annoyed. The only thing I would say was a little bit of a minor turnoff was the prices on the plates. Could have probably shaved a dollar here or there but otherwise it was a good dining experience.",

I didn't realize this until after my server delivered the food.  I finished my meal before anyone came to see how things were.  I informed them that I did not receive the skillet potatoes, and was assured they would account for that on the bill.  They deducted $1.10.  A side of skillet potatoes sells for $3.50.  I understand there may be a portion difference, but I don't feel $1.10 was a sufficient discount for not receiving (fully) what I ordered, and having to let them know at the very end of my meal.  I like Cafe Monte and will come back, but this was not my best experience.",

I made a reservation (even though we were going on a Wednesday night) just in case. Turns out we didn't need one, but the restaurant was pretty full by the time we left. Our food was magnificent. My husband and I both ordered the spinach, arugula, goat cheese salads and they were great. The dressing on them was the best part. The complimentary bread they bring to to table was also so good! For our entrees I ordered the salmon and my husband ordered the trout and we both agreed that it was the best trout and salmon we've had in Charlotte. It was all so good! Our server was great and she was knowledgeable about the menu. For dessert I got the lemon tart to go. I wasn't super impressed with it, but it was sweet which is what I wanted. Overall I would recommend this restaurant, just maybe not on Sunday for brunch without a reservation.   I can't actually describe the food seeing as how we never received service. The husband and I were just wanting to go to get a couple cups of coffee and some beignets as a nice Sunday treat. We got there and the wait was 40 minutes which made sense because it was Sunday at brunch. We asked if we could sit on the patio sooner and the hostess said that was an option. She sat us at a nice little patio table in the sun. We had menus and immediately were served a couple of waters. Perfect I thought to myself this is going to be a lovely morning. Well we waited about 15 minutes and no one had come to take our order. My husband went inside to make sure we had a server and the hostess said oh yes just one minute. Another 15 minutes and we were tired of waiting so we left. Get it together. The food that was coming out to everyone else on the patio looked awesome. So maybe try a weekday.",

We made a reservation and when we arrived the restaurant was about 3/4 full. We were immediately seated at a small 2-top with bench seating on one side. I found this table to be too small and the server had to keep awkwardly moving items on the table in order to fit everything.  The bread they bring out to start is warmed and very delicious. My husband started with the soup du jour which was a carrot bisque and it was great.  For our entrees I had the vegetarian crepes which were flavorful and substantial, covered in a rich, creamy sauce. My husband had the crab cake sandwich and that was good but not the best. The fries were skinny, crispy, and plentiful. The portions seem to be quite large for a nicer restaurant. Would love to try dessert there but we were too full this time.  The service was good and prompt.  Bottles of wine are half price on Thursdays but if you use any other promotion (such as a Livingsocial deal) they will not give you the drink special. I thought that was strange considering we spent over the LS amount on our food alone, but that is their policy.",

I love sharing the cheese and fruit plate or yummy hummus as an appetizer, or having any of their delicious salads to myself.  My favorite main course is the basil pesto penne with chicken--never disappoints!  Other favorites are the seafood crepes and pizzas.  This is also a great place for brunch.  Think french toast, delicious omelets, and eggs benedict.  I've also enjoyed (way too) many desserts.  You could easily come for the coffee and bakery treat alone.    They often have live jazz music which makes the atmosphere even more fun.  This is a perfect date night spot and also great to get a group of friends together.

    "text": "Cafe Monte is a favorite among several friends, and I have had some exceptional experiences here, and some experiences i wish I could get in a time machine and avoid, hence the mediocre stars which regresses to the mean. The ambiance tries to evoke a Parisian bistro atmosphere which is mostly succeeds at.  It benefits from a great location in SouthPark. Typical entree prices are about $12-14.  Here's my advice to have a 5 star experience:  1) Get the crepes. I don't care if you want a sandwich, or a plain old eggs breakfast. Forget it. Get the crepes. Best savory crepes in Charlotte, hands down. I have had the chicken coq-au-vin special crepes and they were OMG.  I also had the shrimp and artichoke crepes with lemon creme and they were similarly amazing. As in \"I don't care if I gain 10 pounds from this one meal, I'm finishing every last bite\".  2) Go on a weekday or a late weekend lunch. Forget going on a nice sunny brunch. We went once and literally were there for 2+ hours and our food (regular eggs) took 1.75 hours to prepare after we finally got our order in. It just is jammed, and the kitchen apparently doesn't know how to deal with it.   Their quiche is pretty good, and their dessert is OK, but crepes are the standout. I wish Crepe Cellar had savory crepes as good as Cafe Monte. Maybe I might come back when they have jazz?",

    "text": "Excellent French fare in Charlotte. I have been to a few French restaurants and cafe monte is definitely one of the best I've ever visited. The food is quite good. I've had both steak and chicken here, both were excellent. The escargot was also done well. Pricing is on par for an upscale restaurant but well worth it. Service is good not excellent. Fit and finish is decent for it being a part of a shopping plaza. They often have groupons which I have used on the occasions I've been there. Not many French restaurants around, this one is definitely worth a look. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "I've eaten at Cafe Monte more than any restaurant in Charlotte. I'd guess fifty times over the years. Maybe more. I eat there with family on the weekends and work colleagues during the week. Now that George's (happily) and Lumiere (sadly) are gone, this is close to the only French food option in town. I've never had a truly bad experience here, and almost always it's good.   The best thing here is the wait staff, who are always attentive and friendly. Breakfast/ brunch options are strongest choice. Lobster salad is good. The various crepe dishes are great, except for the lobster and crab crepe, which swims in cream sauce and has gone downhill over the years. There's a nice cheese fondue. Even basics like the chicken salad are good.   The quiche is highly recommend. The only better quiche in CLT is at Napa on Providence.   Sometimes, but not often enough, they've had good live jazz. When there's a little band there, the atmosphere can be near perfect.   Worst thing about it is that the food is solid but rarely amazing. But the only thing I would definitely stay clear of is the steak frites. The frites are great but the steak, the times I've had it, is tough and full of gristle. Bummer because when done even just ok, that's one of my French restaurant favorites. Also the French onion soup is, as my brother in law put it once, \"sub-par.\" Also, the cocktails seem a little weak recently, so I would avoid liquor here and stick with wine. They have a half price bottle night - I think Thursday.   One thing that has always mystified me about this place is that it seems to really appeal to older people. Like really older. And that's cool. It's just a curiosity to me.   But... love it and will probably eat there another 50 times.",

For the amount of times I have been here, I have only tried one thing on the menu (it is so good that I just keep ordering it time and time again) - the quiche!  The food is great, and the ambiance is adorable. The only reason that I am not giving it 5 stars is the service. Every time that I have been, the service has been sub-par, which is so unfortunate considering that this place is so wonderful in every other way.

There is plenty of parking in a shared lot where the restaurant is located. Upon entering I was greeted. I saw several tables with smiling faces. Never been to a place where everyone seemed to enjoy themselves. At the bar Conrad made some delusions drinks. If you go to the bar see him. I had a French martini and my friend had a margarita. These drinks were made fresh. Our table was ready and we headed to our next destination. I carried my French martini and our waiter saw me carrying this and took it from me. He was like I have it this is my job. He was friendly and attentive. He brought fresh baked bread to our table which was so delicious. I ordered a small salad as an appetizer and my friend had the carrot bisque. I quite enjoyed my salad and the carrot bisque was light and not too thick. It tasted pretty good. For my main course I had the lobster crab crepes. My friend had the swordfish. The blackened swordfish cut like butter. It was quite tasty. The crepe was full of crab and lobster in a cream sauce. Our dessert was in the house. We had a delicious coconut cake. It is a new item on the menu and I recommend this mouth watering dessert.  What a lovely way to end our meal. I will be back and quite loved my first experience. Enjoy!",

Located fairly close to were my parents live, we got lucky that it wasn't full as I read that a few of my friends had to wait to be seated. Hostess was sweet as well as rest of the staff, but reason I gave it 5 stars was for the food.  Come casual and have fun, definitely recommend this spot for brunch..",

My boyfriend and I came here for a quick bite before catching a move....which we had to miss and was non refundable. We sat at the side bar to avoid waiting on a table. We waited about ten minutes before the manager came by and asked if we had been taken care of. She dropped off menus and waited for a few more minutes. Finally, I went to the main bar and asked if I could order and pay immediately, since we had a movie to catch and been waiting for a long time. We ordered a quiche and chicken salad sandwich. My quiche is dropped off and after waiting for five more minutes we had to stop the manager to state we have not received our full order and that my food was cold. The manager NEVER CAME BACK. Our bartender came by and noticed we did not have our full order, apologized and said he would talk to the manager to comp something. (I had already paid the bill). His food took ten more minutes. We finished our food and left. Nobody came back by to make us feel welcomed or apologetic for the terrible experience. Working in the service industry for five years and my boyfriend for over ten, we are very empathetic when service is not perfect. Today, however, is the first time I felt compelled to share a bad review.",

This was our first time here, so we weren't sure what to expect outside of viewing the menu online. While many items are certainly French cuisine, we were surprised to find that there is no sommelier there (though there was someone tonight who \"knows a bit about wines, who can make some recommendations\" which turned out well) and the \"chaude chocolate\" is just regular hot chocolate and not European sipping/drinking chocolate. That aside, our server (Shane) was very friendly and courteous. As for the food, I have to start by saying the little baguette they serve at the beginning is amazing!! For main course, I had the pork chop (which was alright, but not something I would order again, though the accompanying brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes were very good) and my S.O. had the Trout which he very much enjoyed and said he would order again. We opted for the chocolate and Gran Marnier \"fondue\" for dessert which was good but very rich.   I would give atmosphere 2 stars, but the live jazz in the bar bumps atmosphere to a 3 or 4 I think.  Staff gets 5 stars. They were all very friendly and attentive and they truly care that you are completely satisfied with every part of your meal.  Food gets 4 stars. It's above average, but not anything to go out of my way for.   We have heard rave reviews about this place for brunch though, so we will be back to try more!",

Small and quaint they pack them in a bit more for CRW it seems but the giant pics of France will take you away. The CRW menu includes a cheese plate course. I had the beef short ribs which were perfectly braised tender and juicy. The bread pudding dessert was great as well. You can't go wrong here if you are in the mood for a little French cooking.",

She got hooked on the Charcuterie and I on their steak and eggs. We both love their macarons too. I would also recommend their various crepes. The shrimp and artichoke and the lobster/crab crepes. Oh yeah and the short rib baguette delicious, too! LOL  When my parents come and visit or friends from out of town, we always always take them to Cafe Monte for breakfast or a late lunch. And occasionally we'll walk by and order some macarons or a fruit tart to go.  The dining area and bar area are great. If you want to hang out somewhere fun and have a nice conversation with a friend you'll like the ambiance. The service is top notch as well.   The prices might be high for some, but you can taste the quality in the food. In my opinion it's totally worth it. I'm really high on Cafe Monte and suggest that you give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",

She had the kitchen re-make the entire meal, which I took home and had for dinner.  Both Jennifer and the manager were so very apologetic and took the meal off of our bill.

Even the once great croissants are no longer consistently good.  Last time I was in, I got food poisoning: I called later in the day to tell them-and the person answering the phone didn't seem to care.  I left my phone number and name-and no one called me back.  After recovering (three days later!) I finally called.  The manager was \"sorry\" but I had to demand that my charge be credited back to my card.  She wasn't offering!  I'd have to say, sadly, skip this joint.  My sausages, which I believe were the cause of my illness, were the size of silver dollars, and just about as thick, overcooked, cold, and tasteless.  Really, how do you mess up sausage?",

I love their half chicken, steak, mushroom Crepes, and omelets.  Vegetables are always served with the correct crispness (not soggy, soft like you get in some places)!    We love the atmosphere.  While many reviewers say it just isn't like being in Paris... I beg to differ!  Right down to the authentic bistro chairs... this place IS French!  The music, the decor, the window boxes, etc.  all French!  Yes, the shabbiness is missing but the rest is all there.  I can sit and feel like I am back in Paris for just one meal and step right back out into reality when I am through.  :)  Our family really enjoys the decor, AND the food at Cafe Monte.  We will be visiting many more times in the future.",

That has changed and with the opening of Cafe Monte, the availability of tasty and accessible French cuisine became a reality.  First time for brunch?  Get the steak and eggs.   For dinner, get the Escargot Traditionnel.  It's not as garlicy or intense as the escargot I had in Paris.  It's light but flavorful and served with a puff pastry.  The pate is delicious as well (this coming from someone who hates pate).  You really can't go wrong with any of the entree's.  Everything is delicious.  The service is good and the ambiance makes you forget for a moment that you're in Charlotte.",

It was a Saturday, noonish and the place was pretty full with the seats on the patio all taken on a sunny day.  I took a seat at the bar, was greeted promptly and offered a menu and a drink.  I wound up ordering French Onion soup and a Croque Monsieur (one can never have enough melted cheese in a meal).  One nice touch is that I was asked if I wanted the soup to be my side with the sandwich, an offer that I accepted.  The soup itself was hot, as in really, really hot, to the point I melted some skin off the roof of my mouth in my haste to shove the first spoonful in.  The broth was in need of salt in a pretty big way and also benefited from some pepper.  The sandwich was very nice with tons of melty, turned crispy on the edges, cheese.  While it also benefited from the salt and pepper shakers, I would certainly order it again.  I truly enjoy French bistro style food so will likely try Cafe Monte again when back in SouthPark.",

We attempted to redeem a dinner groupon (30 dollar value) for lunch (I completely overlooked that!) and even after speaking with the manager he still wouldn't budge to make an exception (our ticket was $30 before tax and gratuity). While I understand that there are policies in place etc, I was mostly displeased that they would haggle over a few dollars. And while this situation was mostly my oversight, the entire ordeal left me with a poor impression of their customer service. I always highly recommend Cafe Monte to my friends and it is my favorite place in southpark, but this incident definitely dampened my enthusiasm about eating there or recommending it to others.  PS. I received a personal message from the owner with an apology after I posted the above review! I was blown away and gladly changed my stars from 2 to 5! Thank you Monte!! We will be back =)",

    "text": "I hate to be writing this review after reading many of the other reviews on here and having high expectations for a delicious brunch. Cafe Monte has been on my list of brunch spots for a while and I was really looking forward to a nice meal.  My fiance arrived a little after 10 am on a Sunday. We were fully prepared to have to wait for a table so we put our name in and were told it would be about 20 to 25 minutes. We were offered a spot at the smaller bar/ railing where we could order but it was so tight it didn't seem like a comfortable place to eat so we agreed to just have coffee there. About 15 minutes later we had yet to be served or even approached by a server. Spots opened up at the main bar so we moved there with the hope of finally getting some coffee. Service was still quite slow and many others were served before us. We were holding out for our table so we only ordered coffee and refills were few and far between.  After about 45 minutes of waiting for a table we were too hungry to wait anymore and decided to put in our order at the bar. Over an hour after we arrived we were told our table was finally ready but elected to stay at the bar. We ordered the monte Benedict and the fruit de Mar omelet. We were both very disappointed with the lack of flavor and seemingly poor quality of the ingredients. My fiance stated that his omelet could have come from Denny's. The potato cakes on the side of each dish lacked flavor and the hollandaise sauce on the Benedict was flavorless and arrived to me already congealed.   Overall the service and quality of food were both extremely poor. The food was also quite expensive for brunch and there are too many great brunch spots in Charlotte to waste money on bad food.",

They also seemed to be out of several things like mussels,  wines and one of the specials. Service aside, the food was pretty great.  I started with an endive salad with blue cheese and pecans.

I'm about as comfortable at Phillips Place as Billy Graham is at a \"bama rally, but the staff did a perfect job of chilling me out and filling my tummy.  Noteworthy: The ratio of women-to-men the entire time we were eating hovered at about 20-to-1. Which I found extremely amusing. Another fun moment: when the staff and tables surrounding a 10-member elderly ladies meet-up all hushed and waited for them to finish saying grace. Tehehe.  We chose what we assumed would be lighter entrees - his was the open faced veg sammich, mine the quiche florentine (10 and 9, respectively). I've never had a slice of quiche like the slice I had today - they somehow managed to make fondue into a pie. It was amazing, but not in any way a healthy choice, although the side salad helped to balance it out a little. His was equally surprising - although it appeared light on the butter fats, it had a hidden decadence that we both found interesting and irresistible. The frites were insanely thin and perfectly fried. Awesome. I'm going to have to try the pizza and benedicts, but maybe on a saturday when I can take a long nap afterwards. Ya.  I think I'd be tempted to give Monte's a fifth star but for one thing; the coffee. Anyone that's been to France knows how seriously the baristorial arts are taken there - and if you're going to go French Bistro as intensely as Monte is trying to, your coffee had better be up to snuff. My au lait  was not satisfactory - tasted cheap, stale, and like it had been made with skim milk. Not a problem with construction but ingredients. And $3.",

There is a piano on the left as you walk in, so I'm wondering if they ever have someone play it in the evenings.  I got the most expensive thing on the menu just for the fun of it: crab & lobster crepes. It was just okay, I was sort of disappointed. Service is great though. Good hours, open pretty much all day every day except Sunday, I believe...  I don't recommend the crab & lobster crepes, the crepe and the stuffing came separately and didn't taste all that great.",

They were having there special food and wine pairing that I guess they have once a month. Unfortunately, you do have to reserve a seat for the evening so we were not allowed to participate. I am not sure if it is worth the $55 they charge for it or not.   We started off with their cheese and aged meat appetizer ($16) which was delicious. Our food came a little to quickly as we were not even finished with the appetizer when the food arrived. My wife had their special. It was four seared scallops over a real meaty lobster risotto ($26). Her meal was absolutely phenomenal. My friends had the basil pasta with chicken and the crab and lobster crepe ($22). There honestly was not anything overly special with the pasta but it was good. I believe it is the cheapest thing on the menu for $16. The crepe was not visually appealing at all but made up with it with the taste. It had a good portion of crab that made it really good. I had the duck confit with fingerling potatoes and brocollini ($24). The dish was sub par. Duck should be crispy on the outside skin and moist inside. however it was the opposite. The skin was not crisp and the inside was dry. I tried to compensate the dryness with the sauce but it just didnt work well. The server was fantastic and asked what I wanted instead. I had the steak with frittes. It came with a NY cut steak and frittes. She did not charge me for the steak so I do not know the price. Although it was good it was nothing special and I would probably not order it again there. We did not have dessert but you can actually see all there desserts as they have a little pastry counter. Their tiramisu looks really good.   Ultimately, not all the food was stellar but I would go back and have that scallops with lobster risotto anytime.",

Unfortunately, three of us ordered steak options and none of us were impressed. Meat was tough and not flavorful. One was the nightly special and the other two were regular Steak Frites. Total bill with tip for a salad, soup & 6 meals - no alcohol, was $180. Service was fine but with quality and cost, we won't be back. If you like salmon, give it a try, but I'd pass on ordering the red meat.",

Crepes, quiche, great espresso, even steak & frites are all good bets.",

Not that she wasn't attending to us, but there was no pleasant greeting, or even a smile on her face. The food tasted good, but it was the absolute opposite of healthy. I had the shrimp and artichoke crepe w/ spinach and bechamel. I was expecting there to be a little bit of the cream sauce around the crepe, but the entire crepe, all the shrimps, spinach and artichokes was dunked in the bechamel sauce! I enjoyed the first bite, but after that I was just filled with guilt, and couldn't finish the entire dish. Same with the vegetarian crepe that my friend ordered. The club sandwich tasted great too, but only for the first two bites until your mouth and throat were coated with all the butter / oil from it. Now on to the good things: I had heard that they are usually pretty slow with their service, so we sat at the bar, and fortunately avoided the slow service :) The waitress was attentive and sweet. The owner was walking around, and was very sweet too. I really really wish they'll improve their food and make it a wee bit healthier, and when i read a review that says that, I'll be sure to go back there!",

The menu had the traditional french dishes and they had a nice special on a Prosecco which was just what I was in the mood for.  I opted for the endive salad I would highly recommend it was delicious and shared a meat and cheese plate that was nothing spectacular and fairly pricey.

It was a little bland given the description. I ordered the madam sandwich, which was a toasted ham and Swiss with Dijon and two fried eggs. It was more of a hangover sandwich than a culinary concoction, but i was hungover so it served its purpose.   Overall the place was ok for brunch. Atmosphere was great. Food not memorable.

Super spacious and open, it's got a great atmosphere. A lot of families were there when went there recently, which makes sense: it's in Philips Place, literally right next to that gigantic movie there (and near Upstream). But it wasn't annoyingly family-oriented or anything, so don't worry.   Nothing too exciting on the wedding--just your basic Italian fare, but it gets the job done. I had penne a la vodka, my go-to, and it wasn't bad at all. Super affordable, too, which isn't always the case in Philips Place. Again, this place is really conveniently located. If you're headed for a flick, as we were, this is a great place to grab a quick but non-fast-foody meal. Equally good for a post-movie glass of wine or bite. We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Seven of us headed to Cafe Monte for a birthday celebration that was a disaster as a meal and the evening only salvaged by the duty manager doing right by us when it came time to receive the bill.  We ordered drinks that took some 15 minutes to arrive but it was still another 15 minutes before our food order was taken, with 4 of us ordering from the a la carte menu and the rest from the prix fixe. In time the a la carte entrees arrived but it was 20-30 minutes before the prix fixe entrees arrived. The excuse given was that the orders from the different menus were given to the kitchen at different times.  The food met with a mixed reception from rave reviews from some through to indifference from others. My caprese salad had no basil or olive oil but did have a rather gloopy balsamic dressing on the side. It tasted fine but was not what I expected. My steak, cooked rare as requested was pretty good. The trout was enjoyed, as was the lobster/crab crepes. Two people had the scallops with risotto ... both enjoyed the scallops but they differed greatly in their feelings for the risotto.  If the kitchen and wait staff could get their act together this would be a decent mid-range restaurant but it seems they have some way to go. In the end the duty manager seemed sincerely apologetic and ensured there was appropriate consideration when it came to the bill. That was appreciated but we would rather have had a better experience.",

    "text": "Came here first on a Thursday morning around 11 am, and was surprised of nice interior. I was expecting a small little cafe that served sandwiches and coffee, and was surprised of how deep the restaurant is.  I ordered a cup of Earl Grey, the Parisienne Omelette, and my husband ordered the Eggs Benedict and a shared order of crepes with maple.  The Omelette was very good stuffed with brie cheese, and came with toast with jam and butter, a hashbrown souffle thing. My husbands meal looked very rich with hollandaise and running yolk- something I wouldn't enjoy. The crepes were nothing to write home about, I can make them better, and the maple wasn't maple, it was aunt jemima crap. Thank goodness we had a groupon, I didn't look at bill, but after my second visit when I paid the bill I realized what a rip off this place can be. Second Time, 11 am on Sunday, seated right away, I went with two clients and brought my toddler son with me. I had the Earl Grey, and Endive Salad with added chicken, blue cheese, and apple. They ordered Florentine Omelette which was similar to my Parisienne omelette I ordered before, and the pate which I tried and did not like (kinda dog food like) , granted I didn't know what to expect, bc it is nothing like foie gras! My son had a kids meal grilled cheese and ham on croissant with pomme frites, and for 6 bucks it was plentiful and delicious!! They ordered mimosas, tea and cafe au laite. The bill came to 71 for breakfast and it was my treat.. So of course I was a little salty that my tea was close to 4 dollars for steamed water and a tea bag! My salad was expensive as it was and since I added chicken I think it tacked on another 6 bucks(another kids meal) and there def wasn't enough chicken to equal 6 bucks! Her pate was pricy for what it is, dog food and bread. lol  Overall, Would not pay full price here, and only come with groupon! Never again order hot tea. But, I did like what I ordered and want to order more.",

    "text": "Am I in France? Am I in Charlotte? I'm so easily confused after entering the doors of Cafe Monte and I love it.   Talk about a restaurant that doesn't make you feel like you're sitting in SouthPark! Let me preface this review by saying that I work close to Cafe Monte and by close I mean a mere 3 floors in the up direction.   I've been to Cafe Monte many a time. On some occasions its for a quick cup 'o joe (skip this if you can because their regular coffee isn't the greatest), on others its for a to-go box of french fries (no judging) and last night it was to part-take in my first dinner experience.  For the sake of this review and your time I'm going to focus on din-din. For a Thursday night it was pretty packed so my thoughts are to make a reservation if you can. You're always greeted with a smile that makes you feel like you've come home after a long vacation. I love it.   The atmosphere plays a big part of love for this French inspired bistro. Oh oui, it does. My dinner experience was a part of Charlotte's restaurant week so again, I could sample a few different things which I love.  Decisions, decisions! There were too many good ones to choose from. Do I go Coq au Vin (they're specialty), the short ribs (a big fave of mine) or the scallops (mmmm scallops)!?!? In the end I went with the scallops as my mainer and started with the tomato bisque. The bowl of soup was a little on the large side but I apparently had no problems polishing that sucker off.   The scallops can on a bed of roasted zucchini and summer squash risotto. Can you say YUM?!? I didn't manage to get through it all but I noticed my fellow dining companions managed just fine with someone looking pained as to whether or not they could lick the plate.  We had a d-lish vino (from the headache I'm feeling today, it was a bit too d-lish).  My thoughts: GO. GO NOW. It's a great hidden gem off the beaten track.",

Saw several people complaining about their meals and service.  Hostest was nice. Waiter was slow.  Soup came out 2 minutes before the main meal.   Tomato soup was bitter.  My girl got the seafood omlet.   meh.....100% unseasoned.  Got the croque monsieur.....again plain....no seasoning and way too much cheese and not enough ham...I could make a way better one at home.  Side salad had maybe a teaspoon of dressing on it.  Total waste of 50 bucks.",

    "text": "Have been coming here for about 3 years,  and I am beginning to wonder why.   Was in for dinner recently, service was good, wine was good but at $14 a glass for  Sauv Blanc over priced. I had the \"herb roasted\" chicken.... dry, and flavorless. She ordered the crab cakes which were a style I have Never seen before ... 3 round disks that were flattened beyond recognition maybe 1/4\" thick, total weight Maybe 2 oz! Half the plate was filled with red pepper aioli ... ( mayo and canned red peppers) seriously the mayo was twice the weight and surface area of the crab pancakes ?? I guess the \"crab\" was the accompaniment ?? the remainder of the plate was filled with spinach that was barely warmed and wilted mixed with very obviously canned peppers and nothing was done to hide that fact. We rarely complain, but did this time, the server ( Caroline I think) was very good about it. The replacement pasta was better but not by much.   Great location, but with the new competition the kitchen needs to get its act together. I am giving 2 stars for the service only.",

The ambiance in this place transports you to a cute Parisian cafe and gives you a full French experience.  On top of that, their service was great.  I really enjoyed my cafe au lait but wasn't too thrilled with my florentine omellette.  The omelette wasn't all that flavorful and it definitely needed more gruyere.  On the other hand, my husband's fruit de mer omelette was amazing!  The flavors of the crab, smoked salmon and lobster complemented each other quite nicely.  We will definitely be coming back to see how their dinner menu holds up!",

I've been multiple times for brunch and it is certainly one of the best brunches in Charlotte. I've also been many times for dinner and they never disappoint. The mussels and frites and the endive salad are some of my favorites!  The reason for only giving it 4 stars and not 5 is that I went there this past Friday night with 3 other friends. Their advertised closing time is 11pm on Friday nights. I arrived at 9:40pm and was told that the kitchen was closed but that we could have coffee and desserts. Now, I totally get it if I was arriving after 10pm, but I told the manager that we were very hungry and were looking for a full meal.   It won't stop me from going there again, but keep in mind that even if you arrive well before they're closing hour, you may get turned away.",

I had their brisket baguette sandwich (a little disappointing that it was greasy as all hell, but it was good). Their french fries are very good (sprinkled with Parmesan and parsley).

My husband got the French country breakfast, which gives you a taste of everything, and as the waiter told us, is the most popular order. The wheat bread was nice and thick, whole grain and different than your typical store bought bread. I had the eggs Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was tasty and the poached eggs were perfectly delicious. I think the Canadian bacon could have been a tad crispier but still tasty. The English muffin could have been toasted more as well. The potato cake was unique and their spin on home fries; it was nice and crispy on the outside and softer on the inside. I didn't even need any ketchup or sauce with it. I ordered the Americano and the waiter came back to fill it with regular coffee when I was done (complimentary), which I thought was a nice touch. Next time, have to try the beignets!",

The French bakery meals remind me of home - New Orleans.  I highly recommend them.  The customer service is by far the best in Charlotte. I had the fruit de mer omelette with smoked salmon, crab, lobster, scallions and tomato.  It also comes with seasonal fruit, Toast with butter and jam, and a potato cake.

This sandwich delivered; tender short rib bathing in provolone alongside sauted mushrooms and onions with a garlic aioli, topped with arugula to cut through some of that richness.   Others at my table ordered the tuna melt, chicken salad, and BLT. All received top compliments.    Service exceeded my expectations, especially for the lunch hours.

Grateful for a concise menu, hate to read a book to choose my meal.  The warm baguette with butter was so delicious it did not last on the table. Waiter graciously offered another one.  Chose beef bourguinon, meat was seasoned well and so tender, only needed a fork to enjoy. Au jus was beefy and could have used some extra bread to 'sop up'. Baby onions were sweet and mushrooms were finely sliced.  Winning dish!!!!  My dining companion  chose the roast chicken. Sadly, the herb seasoning did not infuse the meat. Without a sauce, there was nothing to say.  Macarons were nuggets of artistry. Enjoyed tremendously.   Minus one star since service was polite but we felt 'tolerated',  there was no attempt at engaging in conversation or inquiry about special ocassion. Another table merited a long and involved conversation.   A lovely place to enjoy when you tire of the chain restaurant scene.",

    "text": "Server: Javier B Food: Beef Short Rib Baguette  Well so much for a good experience that everyone has raved that I would have here. Every year I receive a birthday coupon from Cafe Monte but unfortunately I'm always out of town. This year I just so happen to be in town long enough to enjoy the coupon. However my experience today wasn't nearly as great as my friends have shared it would be.   Walking up I noticed two tables that were very dirty. But I said to myself, maybe the people just left. I walked inside and was asked if I needed help, instead of, \" hello table for how many?\". I responded that I would like to have lunch. The person {who wasn't the host} grabbed a menu and proceed to escort me to the dining area, but I asked if I could sit outside instead.  Menu The menu offered lunch, dinner and even breakfast items. I liked that for those that can eat breakfast anytime of the day, it's available and at a great price. I was undecided on what to order so I asked the server what he recommended. After sharing my thoughts on what I was thinking and hearing his suggestions I choose the Beef Rib Baguette with a side salad.   Waiting in food to arrive So as I waited for my food to arrive I could not help but stare at the two tables that went untouched and I cleaned for 20 minutes now. What really bothered me was my server noticed the tables were this messy every time he approached me. He even went so far as to look at the time while standing at my table. He also came out to gather the sugar packets off both tables and still didn't bother to remove anything. It wasn't until after I finished eating another man came out to bust the tables. It took him all of 3 minutes to clear the tables. Now why wasn't this done thirty minutes ago, I'm unsure. But for this to sit outside, in front of the restaurant attracting bugs is nasty.   Server I was not impressed with my server at all. He did not refill my water once my food arrived, nor did ask if I need anything additional once my food came out. After I finished my meal I had to wait another 20 minutes as no one came to check and see how I was doing. Still not drink refill at all and it was 85 outside. I had to get up, walk inside and ask the host if she could have my server come out to assist me. He then comes out and says, oh you've finished do you need anything. I was not happy and said yes my check thank you.   The service here was NOT what I expected at all. Especially not for the South Park Area.",

If you don't get a rez, be prepared to wait 30-60 minutes for a table on the weekends (they're on OpenTable).  Their menu has a bit of everything...soups, salads, sandwiches, entrees, and breakfast dishes. I LOVE their Benedicts (traditional, smoked salmon, du jour, crab cake) and my husband usually orders the steak frites with the filet mignon.  One downside: their service can be pretty slow due to the number of tables each server is assigned. However, the staff is very friendly.",

Probably because there were just two of us. I had the crab Benedict, which was one of the best I've had! The crabcake's are perfectly spiced and the hollandaise sauce was delicious! Hubby had the chicken and mushroom crepe that was sublime! Loved the white sauce and the chicken was actually moist and tender not the dry, grilled chicken you'd expect! Was perfectly spiced!!  I had been looking forward to having their chocolate croissants but after ordering them the server came back and said they didn't have them :( so we had the beignets instead. They were delicious! Better than cafe du monde in New Orleans! Yummy! They have a Groupon for $30 for 15 and $15 for 9, I bought mine already! Get yours!",

Presentation of the plate looks good, but when you eat into the food, it lacks the 4 stars given. I had the Benedict monte that was good at first bite, but when eating some more, there were elements that didn't make sense. The tomatoes and asparagus tasted out of place and later made me want to throw up. The eggs were cooked perfectly and passed the Gordon Ramsey test. My boyfriend had the short rib with baguette and said it was too oily. The service was great though. I honestly am disappointed and rather go to a small hole-in-the-wall restaurant than this cause I know they'll serve better food.",

We had a seat in the back which was nice for people watching and it was away from the door on a chilly day.   I ordered a latte with almond milk and was disappointed to learn there were no dairy-free milk options. I opted to stick with water. My husband had a hot chocolate and OJ and seemed to enjoy both but I took a sip and personally felt his hot chocolate tasted like Hershey's syrup that was melted and mixed with water and milk.   I ordered two golden crepes but after reading reviews online added in the regular vanilla yogurt, berry and granola parfait without yogurt. I really just wanted a small cup of Greek yogurt but that was not an option. The berry vanilla option was fine and supplemented the very small portioned crepes. I personally think both were over-priced at $8 each and wouldn't rush back for breakfast. The crepes were served cold which didn't help.   Everyone else really enjoyed their meals and the breakfast platters were huge. My MIL ordered the GF Belgian waffle and said it was good but was cold and not crispy.   Our server was nice and efficient. It wasn't my favorite and I won't be rushing back for breakfast but I would try them for dinner.",

Pros: - delicious and fresh food - large portions - yummy mimosas - friendly service - reservations on opentable - cozy but classy atmosphere - outside seating available  Cons: - expensive (spent almost $30) - parking can be difficult during peak times  I got the croissant with smoked salmon and cucumbers with a salad as a side. The salad was really light and refreshing. The croissant was buttery and flakey. And I was happy with the generous portion of smoked salmon. Mimosas weren't on the menu for some reason but they have them! I would come back but only for a special occasion. It's pretty pricey otherwise (though it's southpark so to be expected I guess)",

I was in the parking lot next door when I did a search using my Entertainment coupon app and found that they had a buy one get one coupon here! I generally don't spend $30 on a meal, but I couldn't say no with such a good coupon. The place was crowded, no surprise as the restaurant was in a great part of town and had quality, authentic food. They gave us the option to sit at the bar in order to skip the 25 minute wait which was no problem at all for my girlfriend and I. We decided on the lobster and crab cakes which was one of the best decisions I have ever made. The meal was fabulous and had my tastebuds going crazy with excitement. I hadn't had lobster before this time either and when pairing it with a savory crepe you have mastered the art of cooking. Not only was the food good, but I was also full after eating here. I finished my meal with a small macaroon which I haven't particularly liked in the past and that was quite delicious too. I would most definitely recommend this eatery to anyone looking for good food, even if you aren't particularly fond of French food I am sure you can find something you like here!",

    "text": "In addition to their French food, they also have the arrogant and haughty manners of authentic French restaurants. I went in by myself and the counter was full except for one lady who had her purse next to her. She was saving the seat for someone that had not shown up yet.   At the other end of the counter, a married woman was sitting down with her husband standing behind her. They were not eating. They were waiting for a table.   I very politely asked them if they would mind please sitting at the counter behind the bar so that I could eat. The husband simply stared me down as if to say \"how dare you ask my wife to leave!\" The management was no help at all. If they are that busy, they should politely ask people who are waiting to sit at the counter behind the bar and not occupy a bar seat. I wouldn't waste your money at this place either. I feel that it is overpriced for what you get.",

    "text": "Been here a dozen times. We first started coming because my wife studied French in college and we've been fortunate enough to travel to France numerous times so Cafe Monte seemed like a great place to visit (and it is close). Tonight was the first time with a groupon. We tried to use it last week. When we arrived on a Tuesday we were told no additional discounts with their wine special only to find out groupon is considered a discount when the check arrived; even though our food far out priced the groupon. Tonight we arrived at 7, all \"specials\" were gone. Ok, but this is the 3rd time this has happened in recent visits (2018). Yes, the specials are that good (especially the coq au vin) and it sucks that you need to be a \"seasoned\" guest who arrives at 5 to enjoy the specials. So we order off the menu. My wife gets  the steak. Again for the third out of four recent times the steak came cooked not to order (she wanted medium, not well). This seems to be a trend as the time I tried their beef wellington I was underwhelmed that the pastry part was dry and filet was medium well (no good for BW). My wife is GF and Cafe Monte offers GF bread as an option. We asked 3 times this evening and still nothing. I feel that the last 6 months the service and now the food have both gone from a 5/5 to a 3/5. Again, this is review is off of a dozen visits in the last 2 years, not just one. I really hate writing reviews that aren'5 5/5, but I feel that after 12 visits and multiples visits in 2018, this is needed.",

The hostess had no smile and seemed very bored or in a funk (coming from a hostess, you are the very first impression to a guest, so make a good one). Service was also a little slow, but he apologized and did his job. There was no extra conversation, or small talk. He just brought us drinks, food, and the check! I can't really complain about that, it's all servers really need to do, but a little talking and personality would be nice!  Overall, great food and atmosphere! I got the open face vegetarian, and it was delicious, as were the fries that came along with it. My dad got the baby spinach salad, very light and tasty! We had the vanilla and pistachio macaroons and those are just so cute and sweet! Love it!",

I do adore the pastries, but I can't always have them. Booo on calories and sugar.  Recently a friend and I popped in for coffee and breakfast while we sat and used the free WiFi to shop for vacation packages...  we still have no found the right vacation, but we did enjoy the meal.

    "text": "I try to do a monthly girl's brunch with a group of friends from the Charlotte area. We rotate between restaurants. The only rules are that the restaurant must serve brunch, they must have booze (sadly, only after noon on Sundays - so much for separation of church & state...), and they must offer some kind of eggs Benedict.   After all, I believe the Latin translation for brunch is mimosas & eggs Benedict for all. Right!?!? I read that on the internet somewhere, it must be True.   We always make reservations so we don't have to wait. We checked in but had to wait to be seated until our whole party was there. That's fair, but I sometimes scowl because I want to 'get started' with a drink.   On this occasion, I opted for coffee instead of booze. The coffee was good & strong. I ran out and had to wait 5 minutes for a refill once, which frustrates me. Also, on this occasion they really weren't that busy. There were a handful of open tables before 1PM. I found the service to be subar. Not terrible, but not on point. We frequently found ourselves looking around for the waiter when we needed refills or wanted to order.   My friends got different dishes, which I don't recall... But I surely remember my order. I ordered the eggs Benedict. It's a brunch staple, and really hard to mess up. It's not something I make at home, so when I have the chance to order it, I do.   Oh man - it was AWFUL. Absolutely awful. I've had different 'takes' on Bennies before, and I've had them where the sauce was maybe runny, or too buttery... and I've also had them when the egg was grossly over or under-cooked. I would have graciously taken any (or all) of those flubs over what I got.  The egg was cooked fine. The ham was fine. The bread wasn't toasted fully, so it was mush. The sauce - OH MY, THAT SAUCE - was repulsive. It was thicker than most, but that wasn't the biggest issue. It was SOUR. It was not only sour, but had God knows what in it. It arrived doused in the Bearnaise sauce, and even before tasting it I tried to scrape some off to no avail. Then I tasted it and it was disgusting. It was bitter, sour, and just plain nasty. I know some Bearnaise sauces (depending on recipes & taste) can be a little tart, but this was inexcusable. I tried to wipe off the egg & ham and eat them plain, just to get some protein and value out of the dish. I only succeeded at eating maybe one egg and some ham.   Normally, I wouldn't hesitate to tell the waiter this was terrible and request a different dish. But, the waiter never came back until long after everyone else was done. Someone else cleared our plates, and our bill was dropped off.   So after driving a good hour into the area to do brunch, and paying",

One was pretty good although some issues, on a weekday for lunch and the other was horrific and on the weekend for brunch. In general though this inconsistency leads me to believe that this will not be a worthwhile experience for the future especially if what you want is brunch/breakfast food.   Weekday lunch experience: Got a latte that was served in a big lovely mug, delicious! And then a Caesar salad with chicken. Pretty good. My colleague got a salad with Dressing on the side but they messed that up so she got a new salad. Total cost around 25. Good lunch but nothing to write home about.  Weekend brunch experience: So of course more crowded but even so, not a good experience at all. First, the time to get our food was pretty long. The waitress stopped by 1-2 times and did not offer black pepper like they did at lunch the prior time. But mostly the food was just bad. Many people around us had the same experience too. I got the waffle and a side of poached eggs. Waffle over cooked, eggs way over cooked. My husband got the eggs Benedict which was cold and the eggs were over cooked. A big surprise to see this for both dishes since they pride themselves on egg dishes. The table next to us had the same issue as did the one across from us. Big problem! But even worse the great latte I had the last time was far worse. No big mug, much smaller portion and weak overall.  After these two experiences I am sad to say i don't know how we can come back. Big warning to anyone else that wants good breakfast dishes too. Don't expect as much on a weekend for sure!",

    "text": "*This review was originally posted on my personal blog*  My girlfriend and I decided to give this place a try because we found a Living Social deal that was too good to pass up.  So glad we did!  The interior is fun yet elegant.  When we were there, they had live music playing in a corner and a pastry case on the opposite side.  It made the wait for our table a bit more bearable!  We were seated in the busy restaurant at a small patio (looking) table and were immediately served our drinks.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  We started with some pretty standard appetizers.  My friend ordered a salad, and it was dressed sparsely and was pretty basic.  I tried the French Onion Soup.  The cheese was delicious, but the broth itself was lacking in body and flavor.  We both agreed we'd try something a little more adventurous next time.  We sampled the Chicken and Mushroom Crepes for our entree.  This was really my friend's dish, but she let me have a taste.  They were rich and creamy and I kicked myself all night for not getting them.   I know it looks a mess, and the picture isn't that clear, but it was the best thing we had all night.  For my dish, I chose the special for Friday night:  Broiled Lobster with fries and asparagus.  It was fine, but the waiter really hyped it up and you know...you've had Lobster once, you've had it a million times.  It was delicious, but nothing special.  Plus, kinda messy and hard to handle with grace.  Next time, crepes for me.  After staring at the pastry case while waiting on our reservation, we decided we had to have dessert.  My friend chose the chocolate eclair.  The photo is blurry, but I'm sure you can see the cracks in the chocolate on top.  That was an indicator we should have heeded.  It was dry and uneventful.  Very disappointing for a French bakery.  Vanilla fruit tart was good, but it still had that \"made ahead and sat around\" flavor to me.  I was not impressed, but maybe my expectations were too high for a French restaurant.  Next time I visit, I will try the crepes to see if I have a better experience.",

I had to go inside . They where eating my food more than I was lol  You get a freshly baked bread roll, still warm  I order the herb basted salmon. It was all you can eat mussels and fries on Monday night , but fish sounded lighter . No regrets! The fish was amazing !!! Cook to perfection, and a little crispy on the top. Served w mashed potatoes, and freshly cooked vegetables.  Prices, food very fair and good serving size  Wine  I feel it was a little overpriced for certain wines .  Service: good and friendly ( my server was Sean)  I definitely recommend Cafe Monte if you are in the area .",

The tuna was seared perfectly, sliced thin but less than adequate for $8.  The salad had a ton of greens 4 thin sliced tomatoes and  diced cucumbers.  It was hard to taste the cucumber as there were so small.  That's it.  It was tasteless.  Perhaps I should have inquired about the salad as it didn't meet my expectations.  Next time I will order one of the specialty salads on the menu. Service was great as usual from from of the house with the hostess to our server.  But I wish the server had recommended I stay with one of the other salads.",

    "text": "Kind of between 3 and 4 stars for me, service was ok, my food was great, BF's not so much. Cafe Monte is a great brunch spot when down in South Park. It works great when one of us wants breakfast (he always does) and the other is ready for lunch at 2:00. The atmosphere is cute and French of course but not the point where it feels uncomfortable or snoody. Entering the restaurant I was greeted by two hosts and promptly seated.   It was a mimosa kind of day so my bf and I both ordered one. Mimosas at Monte are not like they are everywhere else, here you'll enjoy a glass of sparkly with a splash of OJ. We thought this was a fluke on our first visit, nope, second visit confirmed that they do a boozy mimosa (not complaining about it). Now for the food. I ordered the short rib sandwich with caramelized onions. Loved everything about it and would order again and again. BF ordered the quiche Lorraine. Over cooked, the top of the quiche actually gave off the burnt taste and was unpleasant which kind of ruined his meal. Looking at the picture now, I'm kind of surprised they actually sent it out. We also shared a waffle, yes tons of food that's how we get down at brunch. Waffle was good but that's a pretty easy one. Next time we stop in I hope we both leave happy.",

    "text": "First time visit so I'll simply rate it on my experience, ordered the crepe and quiche Lorraine both amazing!!! The quiche was one of the best I've ever had. I'm only rating 4 starts just simply because the portions are so small. $14 for a quiche with one small slice it's just not enough. I've had the same quiche for less just as delicious and way more filling. I don't live in the area so I don't know their clientele and if this is what works for them that's totally fine but paying $40 for two small crepes and a quiche is a little much. You have to be reasonable. Either make a bigger portion or drop the price but that's just my two cents. I'd come back again but if I was a regular in the area I wouldn't be there on a weekly.  Also based on the crowd it looks like a lot of older people go here, a simple remodel might bring in the younger crowd and keep this place hip, again just a thought. I love French cafes so I'm all about improving and making it better. But if you don't care about little nit nacks like this it shouldn't bother you the food was excellent alone.",

    "text": "Simply put - the food here is Amazing!  Chef John and his staff definitely know what they are doing.   My friend suggested we attend their wine pairing dinner that they have the last Tuesday of every month. The wine dinner is about $60 a person. They pair a glass of wine with each course of the meal. When we arrived and I scanned the crowd, I honestly wasn't sure what I had agreed to. It was an older crowd and I honestly was prepared for bland and boring food.   But I was blown away from the very first bite. The food is made with love and passion. You taste it in every mouthful. I can't even begin to tell you what my favorite course was because everything was delicious. They had these potatoes that were individually sliced and then stacked back together. It created so much texture within that potato - I was mind blown. We had oysters that were sweet, fresh and the epitome of what seafood should be. The duck was tender and paired so well.   The wine they paired each course - amazing. I'm not a big wine drinker but there wasn't a wine I didn't enjoy.   We conversed with a few other couple and found out that this was a fan fave among them all. Many couples attested this was their favorite wine dinner in town. So much cheaper than other places and the food was the best. I can't confirm how much cheaper than others but you guys, the food is nothing short of amazing.   The night they have the wine pairing dinner - they are still open to public patrons so it's just the back part of the restaurant that is designated for the wine dinner. The wine is available to purchase by the bottle after dinner - at a great discount!   And the courses featured on their wine pairing dinner are items not on their menu. It allows Chef John the ability to showcase his talent.   So yeah - make your reservation now for their next wine dinner. It's always the last Tuesday of the month. You will not be disappointed. Just heed my advice when I tell you to take an Uber or Lyft. The wine will be flowing.   It's very intimate even the restaurant is still open. Chef John came out after dinner and spoke to everyone that came out. He's got a cult following apparently. People had gifts for him!   So enough of that - it was just so good that I went back for restaurant week last night. Again, delicious. The food here is definitely some of the best eats you'll get in Charlotte. I'm a fan. I had the jerk pork tenderloin with coconut rice. It was so much food. I should have taken some home.  But gluttony took over because I couldn't stop eating this meal. It had the perfect balance of all flavors - sweet, spicy, salty, bitterness (from the side of broccolini). I mean I'm writing this and now I want to go back. Like today.   My only regret is that I've lived in Charlotte for four years before ever coming here.",

    "text": "Gracious Sunday Brunch  Time for another Sunday Brunch after Church.  Has become a bit of a concern with the new puppy because my wife does not want to leave him alone. You always hear about separation anxiety with pets but I always though they were talking about the animal and not the owner.  In any case, it worked out perfectly.  Could not get a reservation till 12:30 but since we get out of Church in Davidson at10:30am, it gave us a chance to split up the morning. Drove home and took him for a nice long walk, played with him a bit and back into his crate for a nice nap.  Left Cornelius at 11:45 am to allow time for construction traffic on I-77 and got to the restaurant with a couple of minutes to spare.  Walked in and with our reservations, we were immediately seated at a small table near the back. Cozy and intimate atmosphere that carries the feel of a French Cafe or Bistro well. Love the pictures throughout the building.  Our server was there momentarily with menus and gave us time to review but the beverages and the regular offering as well.  I ordered a cup of the Dark French Roast which was perfect. Good and bold yet still smooth.  My wife ordered an Espresso Martini which she enjoyed as well. Sounded a bit unusual but then again I used to enjoy Irish Coffee so in the same ballpark.  We had reviewed the menu on line before we drove down and my wife had spied a Beef and Asparagus Crepe she wanted to try. Unfortunately it was not on the menu but when she inquired about it, she was told that it was on the dinner menu and they could offer that as well for Brunch.  Score one for the restaurant on the Customer Service side.  I ordered the Fruit de Mer (Sea) Omelet and it turned out to be one of the best omelets I have ever had.  Great variety with smoked salmon, crab and lobster and I think a little shrimp in there as well.  Perfectly done. The Toast was good and the side of fruit, while a bit heavy on melon was also good.  Easy to see why this place was voted one of the top 100 places in the US for Brunch.  Great menu and execution, great customer service and an elegant dining atmosphere.  Easily going to be a favorite.",

Ok now the rest , as mentioned  in most reviews the service is awkwarkdly slow at times  between drink and ordering . I suppose thats manger wants patrons to drink before meal , who knows but can the majority of reviewers be wrong?     -   ok now dinner ,   endive salad great no complaints , entrees   beef bourguignon & confit duck .  The beef was very good and reduction was ta ta tasty  served over a big bowl of  yummy mashed potatoes with mushrooms (ok)  carrot (meh)  and  pearl onions (yay)   the portion was BIG -    the duck confit  was tasty but the plate was small compared to the beef . It was very tasty and served with fingerling potatoes , potatoes were avg compared to the mash  . All in all postive if you want straight forward french inspired food you should be ok here . Besides that it should be supported for fact its not a bs chain restaurant ps charlottesucks",

The ham and egg croissant was very uninspiring and was served alone on a plate, some fruit or salad would have been nice. Will return to try their fries and onion soup.... to see if that influences my rating.... until then...",

The entire host and waitstaff are highly professional and look after the customers' individual wishes and concerns throughout the meal experience. Of course the most important part of going to any food establishment is the quality of the food itself, which I can confirm is excellent at Cafe Monte. I had a pizza that was just the right size and was topped with fresh ingredients. When I found out that the establishment also serves breakfast and brunch, I went there several times for that, too. I usually get the parisian omelette with brie, which is the perfect breakfast if you are really hungry! Since I have been to Paris several times and studied francophone culture, I appreciate as well the attention to detail with respect to the furniture and overall decor. I guess it feels like being in an authentic French brasserie but without the actual Parisian, unpleasant side order of waitstaff attitude!",

Our server passed by us several times, and when after 10 minutes I asked pleasantly if my companion and I could please order some water and coffee, he literally rolled his eyes and walked away. Then he served the beverages with no utensils or napkins.   I won't quibble with the uninspired menu -- it's Cafe Monte's choice to offer what they wish, and mine to patronize the place or not, based on looking over the menu in advance.   But the simple strawberry crepes were stone cold -- not room temp, not chilly, but obviously just plated straight from the fridge and served! (OK, in fairness, they may have been run from the freezer through the microwave on \"defrost.\")  The filling was the same pasty, tan substance as the topping. I thought it might have been a flavored cream cheese but I discovered at first bite that it was neither flavored, cream, nor cheese.   Should I have sent it back? If I had seen our server, or any server, I might have. Rather than ask my companion to wait while I attempted a reorder, I nibbled the few slices of strawberries, picked at the crepe itself, and chalked it up to another mediocre suburban restaurant outing.   Au revoir, Cafe Monte.",

On our most recent visit there was no one to greet us and we had to wait for a little while for someone to seat us in a nearly empty restaurant at 11:20 AM.

We have been 3 or 4 times, it has ranged from fantastic to meh...our most recent visit was ok. my quiche was good but nothing special, mushroom soup was good, frites could have been better. My wife's pulled pork french dip was not bad but a little soggy and too much bread which was a little greasy. we were offered a couple of uninspired dessert choices but as we left, noticed some lovely pastries in the case. We would have ordered some of those had they been offered.  All in all, it's OK but I long for a great French Restaurant in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Every time we visit Charlotte, we inevitably end up back at this old time fave for a French bistro meal before or after shopping in this tony area.  Cafe Monte has the look and the feel right with the woven back chairs, the dessert case resplendent with French pastries, and waiters dashing about with long black aprons.  Our hosts over Thanksgiving love to come here for a monthly tasting of French wines, which sounds like a fun evening the last Tuesday of every month.  We just love to come for brunch, lunch, or dinner!  Expect everything to come in a cream sauce and just go with it, even if it is the day after Thanksgiving!  Their salads, pomme frites, savory crepes and even their pizzas are very good.  Since we had homemade apple pie at home to finish, we somehow managed to depart without trying any of the pastries.  I've saved those to try on our next visit along with the duck confit pizza I should have ordered instead of the very tasty pizza margherita.",

This past Sunday we took all four of the cherubs out to breakfast.  We arrived promptly at nine am and were quickly seated.  Kiddos were presented with a menu - white paper - no crayons, of course.  They only pretend to want children to eat here.  We ordered two kids meals (nutella crepe with fruit on the side) and one of my children ordered off of the adult menu.  I ordered an omelette - the waiter suggested brie cheese - I agreed and it was an excellent choice.  My husband did not like his egg benedict breakfast - he said it was really bland.  The potato cake they served with the breakfasts was also bland. however my daughter loved it.  I have had the nutella crepes before and I loved them but they were only so-so this morning.  My kids were well behaved, everyone ate well, and all was good ... until we got the bill. Over $70.  Really?  My husband asked that I please, please, never let us eat here for breakfast again.  Agreed.",

It's a great atmosphere for Sunday brunch (off the menu) or to meet a colleague over coffee in South Park. The environment is nice, the service is attentive and friendly, and the coffee and food is great! The decor is very French and adorable. Although many people are dressed well because of the neighborhood it's in, I also saw couples that were out for their morning walk or stroll around the neighborhood stop in wearing more casual wear; a place to stop in no matter what you are wearing.  They have a cute, casual bar area to grab coffee and a croissant, little cafe tables outside, or a large dining area with booth seating lining the walls or full tables. Great for small and large parties alike.   I ordered the Benedict Monte and it was very good. I could only eat half due to its richness in flavor, but that is French food for you. Unless you like that much rich taste, I would recommend ordering a couple items and sharing with your partner to give your taste buds a bit of variety.",

After waiting for a half hour asked how much longer the wait would be and was told \"I told you it would be 30 to 45 minutes\". Had that been the case I would have walked out.   Ordered eggs Benedict which were very good served with a greasy cold disk of potatoes that tasted like they had been fried with fish. I should have substituted salad. The other three at the table said the meal was ok and all remarked that it was not warm enough.   I still can't believe a French restaurant does not have Salade Nicoise on the menu. Ah well!",

I waited until now to be able to go with my dad again as he lives out of my state. The certificate didn't sway our opinion at all because we don't need those to eat places lol. It was an altogether different experience this time around though. The waiter was extremely attentive and sweet, especially considering we brought my 8 year old and some places in Charlotte seem to frown upon children diners. My dad and I had cram of mushroom soup and coffee to begin and wow, that coffee was fantastic. The soup tasted so fresh and earthy. He went on to have the seafood omelette which he devoured by the time I had a chance to ask if he liked it lol. The filet and eggs I had were perfect, I didn't need a steak knife, it cut like butter. My daughter finished her burger and fries and went on to have some madeleines which she fell in love with. Me and my dad finished with a lemon and pistachio macaron and they were the perfect way to end a perfect meal and experience. Thank you cafe monte, we will most definitely be back.",

Lovely, charming French Bistro, wonderful staff and excellent food. When we left uptown we moved to SouthPark where we could just walk to Cafe Monte, and we did. (Mostly) same, wonderful staff, same fantastic food, beautiful presentation. We live in Ballantyne now and make a point of dining at Cafe Monte when visiting SouthPark. Just ate there this past week and had a chat with Monte who came to our table to say \"hello\". We marveled at how he managed to maintain his standards, consistency in the kitchen, well trained staff. We told him that Ballantyne NEEDS a Cafe Monte (specifically, BALLANTYNE VILLAGE!!!). So here I am on Yelp shouting it out: \"Monte, PLEASE open a Cafe Monte in Ballantyne Village, pretty please?!?\". There now, got that off my chest. :-)",

They didn't even crack a smile. We waited 15 mins for our reservation and stood there awkwardly in the foyer as the bar was full of diners. Don't offer reservations if you don't take them seriously. When we were sat the hostess just walked off. No \"enjoy\", \"enjoy your dinner\", nothing. I thanked her and received no response. Sadly our server wasn't much better. I asked her how the artichoke app was prepared and her response was \"um, artichokes cooked at high heat.\" I looked at her blankly until she actually described the dish. She did the chef a huge disservice as the dish would best be described as marinated artichoke hearts  roasted at a high temperature and topped with roasted red peppers and served with a side of spicy aioli (she called it mayo, couldn't tell you the spice). my husband ordered an old fashioned from the bar. It was crap. I ordered wine. The wine prices are actually extremely decent. But she never asked if we wanted another drink. The food was great and people put hard work in preparing it. I feel bad that it is overshadowed but crap front of the house staff. My first and last dining experience. I had such high hopes!",

I was really hoping for some really nice French dishes beyond just crepes and quiche.  The menu options were ok but not outstanding.  So, I decided to go with the Chicken And Wild Mushroom Crepes in madeira creme ($14).    I really wanted to try the pommes frites to see if they are as good as I have heard, but I wasn't really that hungry and my server told me the dish I ordered was pretty large.  So, when she brought my plate out, I was glad I skipped the fries on this visit.  The crepes were cooked perfectly and smothered with delicious creamy chicken & mushrooms.  I would order this dish again.   When I first walked into the restaurant, I had noticed a counter with all sorts of yummy looking pastries, so I decided to order a coconut macaroon to go.   It was tres yummy!   I agree with Nicole's assessment - this may not be the best French cuisine in town, but it is solid.  On my visit, the service was good very good and I would go back.",

The menu had many options and I had a hard time choosing.  I went with the hamburger.  I think it would have been good had it not been so undercooked.  I usually prefer my steaks on the rare side, but this hamburger was a little too pink even for me.  The french bread while I was waiting, the side of fries that came with my burger, and a chocolate macaroon for dessert was delicious though!  I will give this place another try sometime.",

Oui!  With French cafe cute insides, Cafe Monte hosts really great, attentive service and a nice array of items. I haven't been yet for an a.m. or p.m. meal, so I'll just focus on my lunch. I went with the B.L.T. with a side salad - damn good bacon, soft yet crunchy bread and a light touch of mayo, exactly the way I asked for it. The side salad was fresh albeit a bit heavily dressed. But I have to note that my friend's french fries were outstanding. I couldn't keep my paws off of those hot little frites. Good thing she shared!   I definitely want to head back to Cafe Monte and try some more deliciousness.",

    "text": "My partner works at 11 a.m. on Sundays, so it's difficult to find a brunch place that opens earlier than 10:00 a.m. so we can enjoy a nice, leisurely brunch.  For that reason alone, we normally just go to the Original Pancake House.  On the drive there, we were reminded of Cafe Monte, a place we had always driven by but never stopped.  We turned into the parking lot and discovered -- what's this? -- they open at some crazy-early hour on Sundays.  We walked in and I was immediately excited, as I was reminded of the French cafe at Epcot, as well as an awesome coffee shop in Chicago.  The restaurant was immaculate and decorated so perfectly, giving it that French feel.  The accompanying, relaxing French music only added to the mood.  We were seated right away.  We walked past the display case of pastries, past the grand counter/bar, and into the dining room full of dark wood accents, large mirrors, and vintage images of Paris.  Already I was glad we had picked Cafe Monte over OPH.    We were greeted promptly by our server and ordered coffee.  The coffee was brought out in small stylish cups and I was worried -- being the big coffee drinker I am -- that it would be a challenge to get refills.  I'm happy to report that not once did our server (or other servers or manager) allow me to see the bottom of my smallish cup.    I went with the Parisian omelette on the menu, which was ham and bacon with your choice of cheese.  Naturally, I chose brie.  We were in a French restaurant, right?  It was full of ingredients and very flavorful.  The brie really accented it.  Served with it was a thick round hashbrown patty, a small bowl of fresh fruit, two slices of -- ta da! -- toasted French bread, and whipped butter and freshly made (?) jam.  Everything was absolutely perfect about our experience that I can't say enough about it.  The pricing was slightly more than you might normally pay for brunch, but it was totally worth it.  The atmosphere, the service, and the food were everything that I needed for an awesome brunch experience, so I'd gladly pay the couple extra dollars.  Thanks, Cafe Monte!  We'll be back!!",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with a gifted groupon. Definitely make a reservation if you plan on coming on a Friday or Saturday night, as you may be waiting a while. Luckily, I preemptively took my own advice and came with reservations.  We ordered the duck confit and the chicken and mushroom crepe. While waiting, we were served a freshly baked loaf of bread, which was fantastically gooey on the inside. Good bread is hard to come by, an this one impressed me (5 stars!).  While waiting for the food, we had the chance to check out the ambiance. Two things stuck out in my mind: noise and clientele.  Most notable was the noisy buzz of music and talking. Whereas many movies may romanticize French restaurants as quiet establishments with perhaps a soft piano, Cafe Monte was buzzing with life jazzy music and rather loud conversations and unruly drunken laughter from a neighboring table. This made talking with my companion difficult to the point of leaving with a raspy throat. I would have preferred a more relaxing and quiet environment.  Secondly, we both noticed the rather stuffy clientele. Many (boarding of most) men were dressed in 3 piece business suits and ladies in fancy evening gowns. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with having a fancy night out, but there was an air of pretension that seemed out of place. Cafe Monte is a nice restaurant, but it ain't the Ritz. It made for some fun people watching, particularly when we added our own voice over, but overall contributed to making us feel under-dressed (despite wearing a nice button-down shirt and slacks).   The food came out in generous portions, laded in butter and cream. The chicken and mushroom crepes were pretty good (4 stars), but the guilt of all that creamy sauce comes fast. I defy you to finish all of it. The duck confit was a little above (3.5 stars), but broccoli over-salted (coming from a lover of salt).  We both left with a feeling of 'meh': by no means bad, but not exactly memorable. We also agreed that a much needed run was needed the following day and that we didn't feel the need to return. I will say that I may have since had some impure thoughts regarding that bread of theirs.",

    "text": "You know those restaurants you go to, eat at, aren't particularly thrilled or disappointed, and the restaurant kind of just disappears from memory?    This is how I felt about Cafe Monte the first time I dined about one year ago. Service was on the slowish side, and the croque madame was like something I could make at home.  It was good, but not memorable enough to go back for another one.    I recently went back for take-out,  after a French onion soup craving.  To my surprise, the menu had expanded and now included some items like a lobster Louie salad, which I was so looking forward to, paying an $16 for.  A good crab Louie on the West Coast is well worth $16.   Unfortunately, it wasn't worth it here.  The soup was pretty standard to be honest.  Granted it was takeout, so the soup wasn't steaming, but even if it were served fresh from the kitchen, the cheese would at least have a nice golden brown coloring to it.  The cheese on this thing was white as white/pale yellow as can be. I would pay $4 for a cup of this stuff...not $7.   Moving on to the salad.  I was more than bummed.  The Louie usually has avocado, hard boiled eggs and sometimes asparagus and some other variations, depending on where you get it.   Here at CM, there was just leaves...and chopped lobster meat.  The lobster was plentiful, don't get me wrong, but it was as tough and bland as rubber pencil erasers. I felt ripped off.  I could envision the chef taking salad leaves out of a bag, and sprinkling pre-boiled lobster on top.   Hmm, so far not so good. At the time I was HON-gree, so I ate both. On to dessert.   The dessert case here is beautiful.  There was french macaroons and coconut macaroons, various croissants and fruit tarts, and a bottom row of cakes. I chose a slice of carrot cake, and a blueberry muffin to take home to my husband who likes a good blueberry muffin.   I'll tell you.  The cake could very well have been from COSTCO.  No, wait, the COSTCO carrot cake is better.  I'm not kidding.  This one was dry and the only saving grace was the frosting, which moistened things up. The blueberry muffin too was dry as if it weren't fresh. (It was $5 badly spent, and I was mad at myself.)  TIP: I should have asked if they made their pastries in-house, or bought them from someone else.  Also ask when they were made.   The saving grace?  My kind server who prepped my to-go order, gave me two free French macaroons. Were they light and tender on the inside? Yes.  The shells, nice and crisp? Indeed.  The flavor?  Very off. I think a good macaroon should have a distinct flavor, and if you don't know what flavor it is, could recognize it. I couldn't tell if it was apricot or honey...heck, it could have been ground beef flavored, and I wouldn't have known.   The reason I give CM 3 stars versus 2, is the good service I got the second time around from the server and man at the host stand.  The order was about 7 minutes late.  (I called and was told it would be 20 minutes, it ended up taking 27 minutes. Hey, my car has a timer in it so I took note!) The ambiance is quite nice, very Parisian. I've heard nice things about their brunch and perhaps it's True.  For dinner, these two items which are pretty difficult to get wrong, fell short.    The star count could go up if perhaps CM thought of itself like a bistro, and lowered their prices.  Focusing on a few really great items and making things more consistent.   Go if you have a BOGO coupon from one of those coupon books or group-buying sites.  I would spend my $ on LuLu if you really wanted some French.",

    "text": "Very nice French-style Bistro. Went for dinner. I had the Steak Frites, and they were more than happy to substitute the green beans (now known somewhat pretentiously in the French vernacular as \"haricot vert\" - duh, green beans in French!), which are not my favorite, with very yummy wild mushrooms! Steak was a NY Strip, again not my favorite (I'm a ribeye guy) but it was good and cooked medium per my order. However, they gave you a choice of Bernaise or Au Poivre sauce, and I chose the Bernaise. MOST EXCELLENT! Very buttery (Hollandaise base) so good choice! My wife had the Beef Shortrib, and that was yummy too. The taste reminded me of a really good potroast (but up a few notches). The wine special was a Chilean Cab for only $22! In a nice restaurant like this, $22 for a good cab IS a find by anyone's standard (wine snobs excluded).   For desert we had their house-made Mousse, which was really good! Very chocolat-ey (is that a word? I'm using it anyway).  Our service was excellent, with a very attentive but not overbearing waitress. Food was served hot and was delicious AND very affordable! French Bistros in the bigger cities (NY, Chicago, LA) are MUCH more expensive. Our dinners were just over $20!!! Coming from Las Vegas, THE MOST EXPENSIVE food town in the US (YES, it IS!), our meal would have been more than DOUBLE in LV.  So overall, a VERY good meal and affordable! Definitely a must return!",

Anyway, I adore this spot  it is located in a moderately busy shopping center and I have never had an issue with parking. Let's move on to the menu...  Coffee: I love coffee, while I may be no expert I drink it in all forms: black, sugar/cream, flavored. I understand that traditionally they do not offer flavored coffee but somehow I was able to get vanilla added once and it was very tasty. Was not disappointed.   I am in love with the eggs Benedict on a croissant. While I only divulge in meals like this every once in awhile it is amazing. I don't really care for English muffins but a croissant.....mmm mmm mmm! The croque Monsieur and croque Madame are also very appetizing.   The service is always on par and I have never had a bad experience In that aspect. Never too long of a wait and a speedy checkout. I hope you get a chance to check this place out bc it does not disappoint!",

I was seated at the little bistro table next to the window and ignored. While waiting for up to 15 minutes without so much as a glass of water, I noticed that others that were seated after me had been given water menus and conversation by their waiter. I went up to the hostess to ask her why I was being ignored by the waitstaff. I had my jacket on and was ready to leave as there are numerous other restaurants in the area. The manager came over as I was leaving the restaurant and asked for a minute of my time. I explained why I was upset and why I was leaving. He said he wanted to make things right and offered to comp my lunch if I stayed. I went back to my table. The waitress came over and apologized for ignoring me. Apparently during the table assignments to the waitstaff my table was missed and no one was assigned to it. The manager brought my lunch over and apologized again and the hostess came over to the table and apologized as well. They made things right and  turned a bad situation around. I left Jennifer a nice tip. I will return to Cafe Monte. PS-The chicken salad plate is fantastic, and their coffee, although not French press, is excellent.",

Nice outdoor seating area. Wait staff is awesome, our waiter Frankie was wonderful!   Okay on to the food. We started with the beignets, if you don't know what those are they are fried dough balls with powdered sugar and Cafe Monte's beignets were the best I've ever had! Lightly friend and soft on the inside, you can either get three or five to an order. For the entree my mother got the quiche florentine and a side salad, the quiche was very cheesy but not overly so, and was delicious. My father ordered the quiche lorraine with a side of French fries, both were delicious! I ordered the beef short rib sandwich, which comes on a warm baguette with beef, provolone cheese, and arugula. It was hands down the best sandwich I have ever had!   Portions were very generous, prices are very fair, service was very attentive and kind, five stars!!!",

    "text": "I'm going to do a pro & con list to make it as easy as possible to lay out my thoughts about the restaurant. Consider my review more like a 3.5.  Background/Facts: - I've eaten at Monte more times than I can count.  - I visit mostly for breakfast and brunch.  - I've been to Cafe Monte several times for dinner. - My husband has celiac disease and cannot have any gluten.  I'll do the con first so as to end on a positive note.  Con: - Biggest problem is food quality consistency. I tend to find a favorite dish and order it over and over again. Doing things this way makes me aware of any changes made to the dishes (also, simply the poor execution of said dishes). So, for example, I can't help but notice when the English muffins served as part of Monte's Classic Eggs Benedict suddenly become smaller and very hard. I wonder each time I order Eggs Benedict if the poached eggs will be runny as one would expect or hard boiled. I detect when a chef uses way too much onion in the quiche Florentine, and I lament when the quiche is hopelessly soggy. Knowing that the food can be fantastic on the next visit keeps me coming to Monte. I just wish they could tighten things up when it comes to the consistency of ingredients and food/cooking quality.  Pros: - Beautiful atmosphere. Sun streams in during the mornings, and the restaurant feels romantic at night. The music from French artists adds to the delightful feeling at Monte. I like the furnishing and decor choices whoever designed the space made. It hits on a lot of what Americans expect French cafe dining to feel like, but it does it without being overly Disney-fied. Also, there's usually plenty of parking close by.  - Servers are always friendly, knowledgeable and helpful, which is especially important when dealing with the gluten-free thing. We eat there so much, the employees know us by name or at least face.  - Coffee is always great!  - Great place to take out-of-town guests.  So there you have it. Cafe Monte will remain on my restaurant list in maximum rotation, but I am watching the consistency issue. I hope I am not let down.",

    "text": "My wife and I used to love Cafe Monte; went all the time.  Then we took my brother in law there a year or so ago for his birthday, and noticed a significant decline in both service and food.  We took a year off after that and tried it again this weekend.  It's actually declined a bit further still and I doubt we will be back.  French onion soup, which used to be pretty good here, came out tasting like dirty dish water (I think they must have actually made it wrong).  Steak was a poor cut - fatty and not remarkably prepared.  Prices remain pretty high ($20+ for an entree).  Menu hasn't changed at all in years.  Wait staff pushes you out the door.  Over the course of the meal, I noticed other customers complaining about one problem or another.  Given the competition in Charlotte, they need to step it up.  Perhaps freshen up the menu, retrain the wait staff, improve the food to justify the prices.  Positives: bartender mixes good drinks; great live jazz some nights.  We really did once love this place so I hope they get it back on the rails.",

We had a large party, so we had to remind the waitress for more bread and she forgot a few drink orders, but she was friendly.   I had beef over mashed potatoes and it was succulent, tender to the touch. Everyone was raving about the salmon, which looked good.  The creme brulee is awesome, I tasted the chocolate mousse , which was good but the brulee was great.  Tables are a bit close together, so I would not plan on a quiet conversation unless you go late afternoon.",

    "text": "The side of sauteed Spinach was incredibly salty otherwise the color was wonderful and it smelled great. The side of sauteed mushrooms looked really good, but they were way too peppery. I never season my food, when its cooked right there isn't any need to but whoever made those dishes had a very heavy hand. I NEVER leave food behind and I didn't even finish half of them.   I had to ask for a steak knife. Waited until someone bothered to make eye contact with me to ask for it by the way. The steak was cooked perfectly - rare just the way I like it and the texture wonderful. The thin french fries were great too, very good! Flavor, texture etc. but as I ate the steak there was way too much seasoning on it as well. Seasoning shouldn't over power the flavor of a good cut of meat and this did.   The biggest issue I had: the staff really needs a lesson in professionalism. I heard one woman behind me talk about a female condom which was just PART of their conversation. They were all huddled in the back while there were people at tables on the floor. Totally turned me off. I saw waitress and waiter in disagreement in the middle of the dining area while setting up a table. One couple complained they had been sitting there ignored. The gentleman got up and said something to a waiter and the manager came over and appeared to make amends in a grandiose way.  My own waiter walked by and for some reason never made eye contact. I was not sure why  - to be clear I NEVER give anyone a hard time nor am I anything other than friendly. Even if the service and food are not up to par.   I was seated in the back, on the left (if you are facing the kitchens) so had a birds eye view - and ear - to everything. I told one friend that I actually felt like I was in restaurant boss type episode and there was a hidden camera somewhere, it was that ridiculous with the staff and how they were acting.   The Manager must have realized I heard what I shouldn't have heard because he gave me a box of free pastries and apologized. The staff treated him, quite honestly? - like crap. It was embarrassing. The fact that those kids (some of them - others adults) acted in such a manner in a restaurant that I'd heard NOTHING but rave reviews about? It was disappointing.   The fact I heard him trying to discipline them - they ignored him - was probably not smart on his part either. He seemed frazzled and angry and just disgusted. Lets just say the atmosphere that night was a 1 star. If the staff acts up like that? Get them in the kitchen and send them home, don't do it where patrons can hear.  In all fairness maybe (hopefully for the owner) this was not a regular occurrence because friends of mine RAVE about this place. For breakfast and dinner saying it was one of their favorites. I went on a Coupon to try it out, and at first loved the atmosphere but it went downhill from there. I also can't see paying that kind of money for a meal that was \"eh\"   I always eat every bite on my plate and I savor each one. I didn't take anything with me except the free pastries and my french fries.   I judge a place on different criteria and I have a sensitive palate and nose. LOVE food. To cook it, eat it, buy it, read about it etc. I think I am a good judge of what I see, taste, smell and - hear.  I'd recommend other places before this one for DINNER - may consider giving them a shot for breakfast type fare and will say the ONE WONDERFUL thing - the best thing about this place - the desserts. They were a little stale but it was after 9pm so that isn't a biggie in my book.   I bought a slice of Carrot cake and Tiramisu - the waiter had closed my bill without asking me about desserts at all by the way......I watched a waitress across the room RAVE about them to a full table of people ( I was solo) and she had me craving them. He was going to give them to me for free because he closed the bill out. I insisted on paying for them and will tell you that it was \"THE BEST\" carrot cake I've ever had! I'd order a whole one for my birthday cake if I could.   The free pastries the Manager gave me? Macaroons are awesome almond cakes too and croissants with chocolate in them. I would recommend this place as a BAKERY and I may give them a shot - after hearing a friend say the crepes were really good - for breakfast. However, not my first choice or even second for Dinner.   For the owner? You have your work cut out for you, I am not a professional in the food service industry but you should consider \"Restaurant Stakeout\" if you find your patronage decline.",

We said we would sit at the bar but then were told we couldn't sit at the bar because we have a child. Why offer the bar when you see we have a child when it's \"against the law\" to sit at the bar with one? We have sat at other restaurants at the bar before so I don't know what's different here. We are new to North Carolina so out of curiosity I asked what the different rules were regarding children since we have sat at other restaurant bars in North Carolina with our child with no problem and the manager was very defensive and rude. I have a feeling they just didn't want a child occupying a seat that an adult could potentially sit at making the restaurant more revenue. Very disappointed.",

The main issue I've been constantly having is that they over-poach their eggs; the yolk is not runny whatsoever- it'll be of a gelatinous state. Even when I've requested that they be undercooked they'll still come out overdone. Also, their hollandaise sauce has started lacking the vibrant flavor it used to have; now it's close to being bland. The newest issue I experienced today is that they no longer serve a nice, thick slice of Canadian bacon on it... instead they have replaced it with two paper-thin slices of deli-style ham (per side). For around $14 I expect the better quality that they used to serve, not the poor excuse of an Eggs Bene they are now trying to pass off.",

These croissants are very French.. So of the best I have tasted. There mimosas are also some of the best I've had. Really good orange juice with the right amount of fizz to it combined with a good pearing of wine.  Trout & Pom frites -  Loved it!! Way better than anything my friend has had here!!! Her favorite so far! She liked it best with mushrooms and no capers.   Cesar salad - croutons were the best part. The romane was wimpy, hardly any crispness to it.      Dressing:      Cesar- Not good, hardly any flavor bland with light fishy after taste      Champagne vignette-  good  My friend ordered the Salmon one time & salmon eggs Benedict another. She said they were both outstanding and perfectly cooked!   For dessert: The original coconut macaroons bring me back to my mom's cooking. Incredible!!  Highly recommend this place!!",

The only reason I didn't provide them with 5stars is because it's ridiculous to charge $5 for a scoop of ice cream to accommodate a dish that is served hot and typically with ice cream in the perfect world (bread pudding).  We visited Cafe Monte for the first time during Queens Fest after riding past on a regular while visiting Whole Food. We were impressed with the staff upon arriving for our reservation and how nice they were and how quickly we were seated even though we were early. The 3 course meal plus a glass of wine went as follows: Salads: I had a tasty arugula salad with grilled peaches atop and my husband had a duck salad that he devoured  Main course: I had the scallop risotto and my hubby had the sword fish both were extremely tasty.  Dessert: we both had the bread pudding which was amazing and even better with the ice cream that cost $5 for one scoop to share (Really). The wine was tasty as well we were given the house Pinot Grigio and Pinot Noir . Overall we will give them another try and not order ice cream unless it's included with the dessert (-;",

My husband had the duck confit which was delicious as well. If you want a taste of France right here in Charlotte, try Cafe Monte - highly recommend!",

At first, I was a little hesitant (being that there's a Tupelo Honey also in the Charlotte area), but I LOVED it.   I ordered the French Country Breakfast and was extremely satisfied! My brother and I also shared the Brioche French Toast and it was delightful (with or without Nutella, my favorite). I was also surprised to find hot beignets on the menu!!!   Also, our server, Kyle was extremely attentive and hospitable. The French decor and the ambiance was outstanding. All this and more made this local French bistro a place to return to when in the Charlotte area. An \"A++\" in my book!",

First - I had made a reservation a week and a half in advance requesting a half booth out of the way of foot traffic because we had a toddler in our party -- we get there and were told it was already reserved for another party. Second - service was horrendous. The party next to us came, got their food and left before we even got our food. We had to go to the front to ask for our checks to LEAVE. Third - it was sweltering in the place. I was wearing a knee length sleeveless dress and was still sweating. Fourth - the staff was extremely unapologetic and not at all conciliatory. I still left 20% tip - I usually leave more for brunch - they earned 0%. I will not be back after being a return customer for years.",

    "text": "Tres Bien!   Hopefully that's right....I'm brushing off my high school French classes....so forgive me in advance.   I'd had this place on my radar for a while. And since I finally had a few days off I decided to give them a try. I'm sooooo glad I did!   The atmosphere is adorable. I loved the decorations and flowers on the tables, it truly makes you feel a bit fancy.   I stopped in for lunch and started with a bellini. That thing was delightful. It packed just the right amount of flavor and liquor and I could have helped myself to a few more. For my meal I went with a classic the croque-monsiuer. It's basically a ham and cheese sandwich on steroids....because it's got so much extra goodness!  There's crispy bread, it's stuffed with ham and cheese and then topped and baked with guyere cheese on top....OMG....seriously I can't tell you how good this sandwich was. I enjoyed every bite! It comes with a side of fries, they weren't my personal favorite a little too \"crispy\" (burnt) but if cooked a little less they'd probably have tasted a little better. But they certainly didn't take anything away from how tasty that damn sandwich was!   I figured why not go all the way out and splurge on dessert....so I ordered the beignets. And I did not regret my decision at all. They were by far some of the best I've ever had. My goodness. Basically it was hot sugary goodness in a basket....trust me you will want to give these a try. They are absolutely worth it.   I'm ready to go back, I want to try their brunch and other sandwiches and entrees....and I will make it a point to get the beignets EVERY time I'm here.",

It is much more than the True definition of a cafe as far as I can tell bc they do much more than coffee and pastries (although they do both of these superbly well!).  their breakfast is top notch complete with Omelet and crepe choices in the classic French style.  Ive had their omelets, croissants, and espresso drinks and they are all top notch in my opinion.  In this respect I would highly recommend it as a breakfast/cafe/ and definitely a brunch stop.  I will have to return for dinner at some point but i have all the confidence that it is every bit as good as its True Cafe offerings.",

Not only the rare items are what make CM special, but it's atmosphere screams class without being haughty or needlessly arrogant. Such a balance is tough to do.  As for economics, you get a greater-than-fair portion and quality for what you pay, so you won't feel shortchanged. I have visited 7 times in the last 16 months with my visits becoming more and more frequent.   I would only suggest that the beef wellington be served on more than just Saturday, but I understand given the labor intensity of the dish, that may be a tall order. It's possible they may accommodate a request for one on an off day given enough notice, but you'll need to ask.  Bottom line, go give them your money. You won't be disappointed",

    "text": "I recently realized that, despite being a very regular customer of this place, I have never checked in or written a review. Time to right the latter part of this wrong.   My boyfriend and I discovered Cafe Monte thanks to a Groupon his mom gave us for Christmas. It's not exactly convenient to where we live, and I might not have otherwise gone there. That was 3 or so years ago and I've lost count of how many times I've been, for both brunch and dinner. I read through some of the negative reviews and I'm genuinely perplexed; I've never had a bad experience here.   I love the atmosphere, and the service is always good if not outright super. But the food. Mercy, the food. I've tried just about everything on the menu at some point (either ordering it myself, or taking a bite off my dining companion's plate) and have never been disappointed. Certainly, there are things that aren't really up my alley, but that's the case wherever you go.   Some of my favorites are: the French country breakfast (that skillet potato is the best); steak and eggs; lobster & crab crepes; beef & asparagus crepes; trout amandine (I sub asparagus and mashed potatoes as my sides); beef short rib bourguignonne (very good on a cold winter evening); mussels & frites; roasted artichoke hearts; four cheese fondue; and the brie en croute.   They do nightly specials, too. Off the top of my head: Monday is all you can eat mussels, and Friday is lobster. I've taken advantage of both specials at some point, and really enjoyed both.   Prices are fair, in my opinion. But, PRO-TIP, keep an eye on Groupon, Living Social, etc. because they frequently have deals available.  I'd definitely recommend this place. In fact, when friends and family come to town we almost always go here. Hopefully the negative reviews were isolated incidents, which is unfortunate but, in my experience, not the way Cafe Monte normally functions.",

We found this place thanks to Groupon for their $17 for $30 option in an effort to try a new restaurant.   Upon arrival we were quickly surprised but the live band and European-feel decor. We were quickly sat and started off our meal with complementary home made bread with butter, and ordered the Charcuterie appetizer to start. We also ordered a bottle of wine to share, one of the cheapest ones they had at $28. Most bottles here range from $28-$130, but majority in the $30-$50 range.  The Charcuterie was a great spread of different cheeses and meats and pate with toasted bread to enjoy. My boyfriend ordered the salmon and I ordered the mussels. Would order the Salmon again, the Mussels were good not great, but sub your fries for the mushrooms and I promise you will not be disappointed!   Overall I would absolutely come back here for a romantic evening, birthday or anniversary where I don't mind spending about $100 on dinner for two people. Excellent service and food all around!",

Yes, Sunday brunch on a sunny day is going to be busy and we were waiting for every one of the twenty minutes that the hostess said it would be. No fault there.  We started off with a plate of beignets, which had the required heavy dusting of powdered sugar and also a small pot of strawberry jam for dipping/scraping. Very hot and very tasty. A nice starter while you look over the menu.  For mains, we each went with omelets or the crabcake benedict. Each was a good portion with plenty of filling and lots of hollandaise on the benedict. The hashbrown potato casserole was very yummt and the omelets also came with a small bowl of fresh fruit - blackberries and blueberries and such. Nice.  Very good coffee. Cappuccino was very good.  Service was good, ambiance was great and the food was very good.  We'll be back to Cafe Monte for sure.",

I recommend getting a reservation if you would like a table in the main seating area because the food is truly that good. I had the crab cake Benedict and my date ordered the croque monsieur. They were both prepared excellently and the cheese on the croque was done perfectly. The side salad was also in traditional French fashion and was simple and delicious.

They also take reservations through open table, but we found that out after the fact. Next time I'll book one.   I ordered the Florentine quiche ($12), which came with a side salad. The salad had tomatoes and cucumbers on it with a lite olive oil dressing. Very light. The quiche was good, but nothing that blew me away.  It was actually quite creamy, but that could have been from the cheese. I wish the crust was a little more flaky, but overall I enjoyed it.  Others in my party got the Benedicts and then all enjoyed them. However, the breakfast potato it came with was very bland. Again- good but nothing special.   Our service was great and fast, however I wouldn't be too eager to return again. Nothing stood out to me to come back again.",

The food also did not disappoint! I mean how can you go wrong with a buttery croissant? I decided to branch out from what I would normally order and ordered the steak and eggs. The steak was cooked to perfection. I ordered eggs poached, which doesn't always work out, but they were good extremely well. The potatoes where definitely one of my favorite parts, crispy and flavorful. Overall, none of the food disappointed!  In short, Cafe Monte is a french cuisine delight! I will definitely be returning for more!!!",

Make sure you grab a reservation because i heard them tell people that there was a 3 hour wait if they were trying to walk in. The bar was actually good as well. Making a brunch drink is typically rushed, causing inconsistency but I felt that they did a good job! We had the beighnets and the Monte Benedict. Couldnt have asked for more in our experience here!",

Disclaimer: I had to bump up the staring  for Yelper readers but still say this is more of a 3.5 for my own quality control purposes.   We dined during Spring Break and had I, the Risotto kid chicken dinner (they served white meat - IMPRESSIVE)  sorority sister - braised beef (pot roast) THIS WAS BETTER THE NEXT DAY. THE FLAVORS CONGILED AND MWAH :* EVERYTHING WORKED.   The dine in isn't stuffy. Pretty relaxed. Didn't sit outdoors but on another occassion I might just. The risotto wasn't anything to write home about. The broiled chicken was seasoned well and juicy. The side dish wasn't memorable but no complaints from the kid. I tasted the Beef with the petitite carrots and mashed potatoes. Took pictures of the dishes as they were presented well.   The next day that beef dish was off the chain as the seasons really burst in your mouth.   Service - ok, 3 stars. Solid nothing spectacular.  Ambiance - ok. More like a cafe which precludes the best name for them and it's nice to have so many French options in CLT. It doesn't take me to France but it does remind me of WestBank Gretna/New Orleans. So it's French-esque.  Enough to get your fill.  Location - VERY SMART. This is the crowd/side of town to cater to.   I consider this place to be smart dining. Nicely appointed. Would feel comfortable having business lunch or dinner or a family gathering.  They get 4 stars for offering a GroupOn then graciously accepting it and not having a funky attitude like some places do when you redeem a GroupOn.   End Result: I will return.",

We had the beignets as an appetizer. An order of 3 was large enough for us to share and they were light and pillowy perfection! My husband had the Benedict Monte and loved it. I had the steak and eggs. I asked for a side of Brie cheese and Hollandaise and had my eggs over medium. My favorite part of the meal was my Bloody Mary!

As we did not have a reservation I fully expected to wait if necessary. The wait was brief and the decor was nice, along with the hustle of the crowed/staff the place was alive. That seated us at a small round table that my daughter loved. It had a little European feel she said. We were greeted be a young lady named Rachel she was our server and she was fantastic, very attentive with an easy approach. We started with some escargot and charcuterie. The escargot was great however the charcuterie wasn't my favorite. Not that it was bad I just found the pate a little dry and they gave me cheddar cheese with it and the very firm sausage was cut way to thick almost impossible to chew. But the veggies were great. We then moved in to entrees I had the Beef  Burgunion (sp)while my daughter had the Duck both were wonderful.  Now what really stood out in my experience was the all around service, you see before we where served but right after Rachel had taken our order it dawned on me that I had forgotten to request no mushrooms in my dish. So one of the gentlemen who sat us was walking by and I expressed the situation to him. He assured me that it would be no problem and walked to the back. What's impressive there is that I'm sure the kitchen hadn't gotten my order yet because I hadn't even received my apps yet. So clearly the communication amongst the staff is stellar.  In my experience the food was very good and the service was great, I'll defiantly be going back.",

For coffee, I usually have an americano and my wife a latte, and they are also excellent, as good as any high end coffee house.  My only problem with the place is that we sometimes make the trip and there are just too many patrons waiting for a table.

The crust is light, not too heavy nor oily. There are mushrooms a plenty on this baked pie, nestled in with a heaping amount of goat cheese. If this doesn't sound yummy enough, the finished product is covered in a giant's portion of fresh arugula.

They delivered the food and cleared the appetizer plates all at once.  No one ever checked to see if we enjoyed our food or wanted anything more to drink.  At this point, it was 9pm and the restaurant really was not that busy.  Our waitress must have been more concerned about getting off her shift then the service she was giving us.

    "text": "A nice little place, tucked away in Phillips Place.  I just happen to see it from the road and decided to pop in for a drink and a bite to eat.  It was a Tuesday night and the place had only a few tables occupied and as I wasn't in the mood for table service, I opted for the bar.  The wait and bar staff were all buzzing around..........except they were not buzzing around the customers.  There were multiple instances that the bar staff and wait staff gossiped about everything which was unprofessional - but considering the average wait staff aged looked to be barely out of the 20's I'll give them a break this time. It took a while to get drinks....we had to ask for water......but we did get our order of a meat and cheese plate and an order of Crab & Lobster crepes.  The chesses and meat plates in this town continue to be small portioned and a bit disappointing......Vivace is the only game in town where you get a nice amount of everything.....Cafe Monte...take note.  The one plus is that they serve a VERY inexpensive breakfast during the week.  The main dish, which was shared between me and my GF was good...very rich.  All and all it was a good experience until the I was handed the bill which was fair pricing wise and had it returned to me with a larger around of over $10?  I asked the waiter and he had swiped my card for another larger bill.  He corrected the problem, but handed me the corrected charge slip that required a signature..but only one copy...the copy for the store....meaning if the correction didn't go through right I would have been screwed...so I had to ask him for my own copy.    So in closing, taking away the factor of either inexperience or just plain non-paying attention wait and bar staff, Cafe Monte is a cute little cafe in South Park worth checking out.......if you have the same issues I did.......then one time might be enough *grin*.",

Was expecting to fight a crowd, but I guess I am thankful I didn't have to but also curious that I didn't have to.  Got lucky I suppose.  Made a mistake in ordering the hamburger \"medium\".  It was tasty and I managed to eat the whole thing (waaaay too much bread) but it was also overdone, well beyond medium.    Got salad instead of fries and that was a good choice.  Used an Entertainment 2015 coupon which made my lunch price an extreme bargain.  Will definitely be back.",

The salad with goat cheese was awesome and they made something that used to be on their menu that is no longer for me as a special extra!  We own 2 restaurants and are very picky about service, food, quality, ambience & prices.  It was worth every single penny and we will definitely be back.  Thanks for a great date night!",

Our server was attentive and did a great job of presenting the specials.  The food came out at a good pace and we were never left waiting. We ordered the oysters and the escargot for apps, both were delicious. I got the risotto for my main meal - very cheesy with lots of vegetables and shrimp. Serving size was enough to take home. My boyfriend got the lobster which I tasted and was also very good (although I'm from Boston so I have had better lobster). Beignets for dessert were also great! And even with 2 apps, 2 main meals, 1 drink, 2 dessert, and 2 cappuccinos the total was less than $150 (before tip). Overall a great dining experience. I would highly recommend this restaurant.",

The atmosphere is also very nice.  Being in Philips Place, it has a comfortable feel and is very pleasantly decorated.  I personally got the seasonal vegetable risotto with shrimp.  The risotto was a bit undercooked as the rice had a bite to it, but it was edible.  A few people got the trout almandine and liked it.  One person gave me a bite of her beef to sample and it was like a pot roast - would have been better with a reduced wine or gravy sauce.  One lady got the crab cakes and said they were ok, but she was from Maryland and had some expectations  :-)  One person got the mussels and really liked it.  A couple of people got the pizza and it was so-so.  But hey, you're at a French restaurant afterall, and you order pizza ?  The cheese plates were VERY good quality cheeses and I highly recommend them for a nice starter.  Overall, go for the service and atmosphere.  You will have a lovely time.",

    "text": "I've never been to France.  I know people who have, and I know people who grew up in France, but from the stories I've heard, Cafe Monte sounds like it could exist quite easily on many Parisian corners. It's casual and sophisticated at the same time, unobtrusive and genuine. And the food is killer.  Cafe Monte has become my favorite brunch location.  Their cuisine is in the country French style: very comforting, a light hint of French sophistication, and features ingredients you would easily expect to find on the farm or at the market. My first venture included the Benedict Monte, a hybrid concoction that seems to fuse the French and American versions of this dish into a delightfully delicious meal. Soft, crunchy English muffins, oozing eggs, and a smooth Hollandaise.  I've also tried the French country breakfast, which is equally amazing. The coffee is great, too - nothing over the top, just good tasting lattes and coffees.  If the lunch and dinner offerings are just as good, I could see visiting here very often.",

The front half of the restaurant really does feel like a french bistro, and with a wonderful duet of a trumpet player and a piano player, the music was great.  Service was attentive. We brought a bottle of wine from our cellar and corkage was $15. Our server noticed the bottle in its neoprene carrier as soon as she showed up and asked if we had white or red, and what style glasses we wanted.   My husband and I were both dying to try the steak frites, since we loved that dish in our favorite restaurant Paris. He ordered his au poivre, and I ordered mine with Bearnaise sauce. I'm docking Cafe Monte one star because they completely undercooked my steak. I ordered it medium, and I received a steak that was rare, as in cool in the middle. My husband ordered his medium rare and he also received a rare steak.  I prefer my steaks medium, but will eat just about any steak on either end of the spectrum of doneness so as to avoid sending it back and risking spit, so I kept my mouth shut. Be prepared to have your steak undercooked if you eat here.  Aside from that one issue, everything was great. Hopefully they'll get some more knowledgeable cooks in the kitchen in the future.",
