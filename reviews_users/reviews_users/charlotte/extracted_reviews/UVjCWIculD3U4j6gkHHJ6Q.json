It was on a Monday around 7pm, so not that busy at the time.  I ordered the Michigan hot dogs with added cheese and the fried pickles.  The wife had the alfredo, no adds.  The hot dogs were great!  Definitely order again, the buns are grilled (nice touch).  Fried pickles little thicker slices and a little soggy but breading stuck and the dipping sauce (chipotle mayo) is very good.  Wife said the alfredo was a 3 out of 5 for flavor but they give you a LOT of it, enough for two!  The garlic knots were awesome she said.  She said she will definitely order it again.  All in all, we liked it.  The menu is pretty decent and just about everyone should be able to find something they like.  I will be trying more!",

The atmosphere is very friendly and the volume of people talking makes it feel like a happening place, without having to raise your voice to talk. I think the friendly atmosphere starts with the wait and host staff as soon as you walk in the door until  I you leave. There are plenty of TVs, beers on tap and bottled, and other excellent dishes.",

    "text": "Normally my experience would be a four star review but given this was only their 5th day open they will get a five star review. This place is super close to my home and the name of the restaurant is my last name so I had to give it a try. The second we walked in the door we were greeted by multiple different employees and were seated right away. The place was super busy which was a good sign. I ordered a vodka drink and my husband ordered a margarita and both were very good. My daughter ordered a milk, which they were out of but an employee ran to the grocery store next door and took care of that situation promptly which was awesome. We ordered the cheese sticks and garlic cheese bread as an appetizer. Both items came out quickly and were not disappointing. We both order a slice of the supreme pizza which was on the menu for 3.50 a slice plus wings. After 20 minutes of waiting for our food our waitress came out to tell us the buffalo pizza could not be ordered by the slice. Now with two kids, I would have appreciated knowing that faster than learning of this mix up 20 minutes after we ordered. I ended up just getting a slice of pepperoni which took another 20 minutes for a slice?? The pizza was like a 4 out of 10. My husband got a slice of cheese and said the same, really not impressed! The wings though were great. Like really great! So we will be back and we feel the little kinks that we had were just due to only being open for a few days! Kudos for doing such a great job with such loud crowds your first week. Can't wait to come back and try some pasta!",

The salads came promptly and the pizza came out within 15 minutes of placing our order.  The pizza was very good and the two of us could not finish it; we ended up bringing 3 slices home for leftovers.  We enjoyed Pasquale's more than we did De Marco's, and the service was better too. Our only complaint was the sweet tea wasn't very good. Noted, and we'll order something else to drink next time.",

In my opinion, the Italian dishes are devoid of any flavor other than oregano; which is overwhelming in the extremely underwhelming sauce. Its the kind of sauce that stays with you LONG after you eat it.   I was with three other people tonight and everyone agreed that the food is below average. Too bad, because it's a decent price point and a nice location.",

We got to try our friend's Pasquale's chicken pizza, and MAN it was good! We totally should have gotten a whole pie of that to take home! They make their own special secret sauce, which I described as a mix between BBQ sauce and buffalo sauce, because it was sweet with heat! Service is the best, from people greeting you on the way in, all throughout your meal and wishing you a good day on the way out.  We were just visiting on our travels around the US, but we would be back if we find ourselves in the area again!",

Danny's down the block are 6 for $2.95 and 13 for $4.50 and Brooklynn Pizza Parlor in South Park offers a dozen knots (my opinion best in town) for only $4.50. Guys it is bread most Italian restaurants give bread for free....  Okay now that we got that off my chest: The staff are very friendly, service was excellent and they do offer some good specials. Especially lunchtime. The pizza was good, the crust was not as good as I would expect for NY Style pizza, it seemed undercooked. The knots were good, not great, fresh, but not enough garlic, sauce was delicious.  Overall putting aside the cost of knots I would rate it a B. I will give it another try.   My son who is the most fastidious eater I know especially when comes to pizza (he does not like Danny's down the street), liked it, but so much the knots very picky.   One last note: the curb when entering from McDonald's is hidden and I almost got my car stuck on it, who knows the damage caused to my undercarriage. You need to put a bush or something so people can see it!! PLEASE!",

A nice flatbread with sausage, roasted peppers, caramelized onions and topped with ricotta cheese.  Flavors were perfect!  Our waitress was very attentive.  Very helpful with their menu.

    "text": "This establishment has a bit of an identity crisis going on. It has picnic tables like a BBQ joint. It has an Italian restaurant's name. The menu consists of mostly sandwiches, burgers, pizza, and wings. It also appears that they are a brew house, as they have brew kettles sitting directly in the dining area (and big puddles of wetness underneath them, as well). It also has a bunch of TVs like a sports bar. Even the menu says \"Pasquale's restaurant presents Lake Wylie Brewing Company.\" I have to say, I just don't get it.   All that aside, I could forget about all that if the food and service were good. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case when my family and I visited. My daughter and wife ordered calzones. They came out looking impressive in size, however, lacking in filling and the dough tasted like it came from the deli of a local supermarket. My wife ordered one with mushrooms, artichoke, and spinach. When it arrived, it was missing the mushrooms. When we mentioned this to our server, she became defensive and said \"you probably can't see them because they are small.\" to which my wife replied by opening the calzone and showing her there weren't any mushrooms. After that happened, we were ignored for over 20 minutes.   I ordered spaghetti with meatballs. The sauce was clearly something that came out of a jar, probably Ragu. The meatballs tasted suspiciously like something I would buy in the frozen food section of Harris Teeter. I took a few bites and then left it alone.   So, to sum up....sub par food, sub par service, and a throughly confusing theme. Just not what my family and I wanted on a Saturday evening.",

Pizza ordered by others was excellent NY style. Good dough makes the diff for both. Truffle fries were excellent. These are often hard to do but the ratio of oil was perfect with the hand-cut, fresh taters. Came back to try wings. Some of the best you will have. Fresh, not frozen and beefy. Order of 10 for $11 again is enough to share or take home. Loved they came in metal bowls with enough sauce to toss as you go!  Real way to prep and serve wings. Nicely fried. Pair with one of their house-made IPAs for a great lunch.",

For this visit, our whole team at work stopped by for lunch.  Lots of variety to choose from including salads, wraps, subs, burgers, pasta, pizza, and wings.  Portions are really large, so a colleague and I shared a Chicken Parm with Pasta.  I would have taken the whole plate of pasta, but I was traveling on business, so leftovers end up going to waste.

She took the shrimp back to the kitchen and came back and said \"you were right, they were dry and over cooked\".

Okay, not the healthiest, but really good. While not quite to the same awesome greasiness standards of the poutine you buy in Quebec, it was pretty darn close... and it was good.

    "text": "It takes a lot for me to leave a review, but I felt obligated to get on here and tell everyone about the amazing customer service I received last night. My boyfriend and I went there for pizza and some drinks and when the waitress brings us our pizza, she says that there is a hole in the pizza and they are making us another pizza free of charge to bring home with us. When we were eating our pizza, it was delicious and it was barely falling apart. We wouldn't have complained about it because all we cared about was that it tasted awesome which it did! The cook comes out and tells us that he is training a new guy who made our pizza but wanted to ensure we had a perfect pizza to bring home with us free of charge. We never would have complained about the first pizza because it was still delicious but just because they did this for us, we will most definitely be back. Great customer service is important to us so this is our new favorite local pizza spot and we will be back OFTEN! Awesome pizza, great drinks, and phenomenal customer service? That's what will keep bringing us back!!!",

    "text": "Crazy to learn this has been hiding around the corner from me all along. When my Parents come into to town they always look to visit non-chain restaurants and new to us/them restaurants. Pasquale's was the choice on their first night.  We were seated right away. It took a little time before we were waited on, but they busy.   They have a decent on tap craft beer selection. We ordered some cheese sticks as an app, boy those were tasty! I had pizza for lunch so I opted just for a basic wrap - Greek chicken wrap to be exact. Also ordered was an entree salad and chicken parm entree.  We were all happy with our selections and cant wait to go back.",

Then my boyfriend and I got the buffalo chicken wrap, a steak and cheese sub and shared house chips as our side, truly enjoyed everything! PLUS the brew their own beer! Best sports bar we've found in this area! Definitely will be back.",

    "text": "We put an order in to go and take it home.  I'd never been inside or had their food before.  We were in a hurry, didn't have time to make dinner and decided to roll the dice.    My husband got the Stromboli and I got the Garbage Spaghetti.  I feel like I owe somebody's Mama a Thank You note!  First of all - pasta is perfect, Al dente.  There's onions, spinach, peppers, sausage and these ginormous meat balls!  But honestly the sauce is what makes it.  The salad was kinda special too with all the veggies and pepperonis and olives.  Got the Italian dressing which tastes home made.  I'm guessing it's all from scratch there.  Really the only thing not spectacular was the garlic knots.  They weren't bad they were just garlic knots.    Anyways, the portion is huge and I'm pretty sure it's gunna last me two more meals!  At first when we ordered I thought wow a bit pricey but honestly whoever's Italian Mama made this can just take my money.",

Then we go outside two empty patio tables with no one there. Waitress comes running out \"you can't sit there these tables are taken\"! Really? Have you thought about reserved signs? Then we are informed we can sit at the picnic table but you have to come inside to the bar to order a drink and food! No service! SMH! The picnic table had screaming kids running around. No thanks! We left!",

    "text": "We showed up at Pasquale's a week or so after they opened and have returned over and over again. (Check our Check-in's). This joint is a gem.  Not only are management and staff beyond friendly, we love their menu and craft beer selection.  We typically love to get pizza and various sides, but lately I've been blown away by their pastas.  The Cheese Ravioli Marinara is to die for and the baked Ziti is 2nd to none.  Perfecto!  Now their lunch special til 4PM is $4.99 for 2 pieces of pizza and a drink.  That's an awesome deal.  The slices are YUGE!  Love it and much better than $5 for a burger and fries nearby.  Seriously!   As a lover of Craft Beer, this place is also top tier.  They have 10 out of 14 drafts on tap that are Carolina Craft Beers. 10! That's better than almost any Italian restaurant I've been to in the Charlotte area.  Love it.  I'm not a wine and liquor person, but their selection looks great too.   All in all, Pasquale's is awesome.  I have met Jamie, one of the owners, and he's great; Always looking to improve.  And Nikki Frost behind the bar as well as Brie...cant find better folks anywhere. Great place and I look forward to stopping in whenever I'm in the mood for beer of pasta!  Kudos!",
