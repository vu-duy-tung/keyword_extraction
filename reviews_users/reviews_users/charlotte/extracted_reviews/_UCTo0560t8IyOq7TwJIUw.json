I ordered the Filet with local Sweet Fingerlings and Chargrilled Brussel Sprouts but there was nothing \"chargrilled\" and instead they were over cooked and mushy. The best thing was the Milk Chocolate Creme Brulee.  I really wanted to enjoy my dinner but I can't help but think I could have saved a lot of money on an overpriced dinner and cooked a better one at home.",

Only because I'm nitpicky, I didn't like that we made a reservation for two, and were sat at a table set for four, which they they had to alter.   A lot of the staff would come over to chat, which was quirky, but they were all very nice.  Our waitress found out it was our anniversary and the chef sent us out some samples of his specials, along with a dessert brownie and homemade icecream at the end.  A MUST try if you go, is the Foie gras flatbread appetizer.  Whether you love Foie gras or hate it, you need to try it!. My husband ordered it because he loves Foie gras, but I (usually) can't stand it. It was honestly one of the most delicious appetizers I've ever had! I ended up eating his app and neglecting my own (butternut squash soup, which was also delicious, but not a star like the flatbread).  I had the scallops and my husband had the duck, we both were extremely happy with our entrees. The only thing I wasn't 100% satisfied with was my drink.  I ordered the Berry Sangrai. It wasn't very berry-like, and kind of bland.  Other than that, and the table setting, everything else was spot on. Highly recommend.",

We had crispy artichokes and an orange beet salad to start. The artichokes were unimpressively prepared and the salad was so soaked in dressing that we couldn't enjoy the flavors. The bass, however, was perfectly caramelized. Unfortunately, even the chocolate torte left something to be desired. Do yourself a favor: there's lots of great restaurants in Charlotte; don't waste your money here. Caveat: hubs works locally and says breakfast and lunch items far surpass the dinner offerings. Don't know what others have experienced, but this place should consider hiring a new chef.",

The bartender picked a great wine for my mom and I to drink and was great all around. Dinner was mediocre (I got the turkey burger and sweet potato fries, she got the salmon dish). The burger was flavorful but her dish was on the small size for the price and was just fair.   Dinner gets 3-stars because although dinner was ok, dessert was bad. I ordered a s'more type sundae which was described as homemade graham crackers, marshmallow, and then toffee ice cream and bananas with butterscotch. The graham cracker was hard as a rock and the ice cream had MAJOR freezer burn. I love my desserts so if that is messed up it ruins a meal for me.   I wouldn't come back again and I wouldn't recommend it, the staff was just too nice for me to say it while I was there.",

    "text": "Went there for a post-Valentine's Day Dinner - had a great experience! Maybe it was the lower expectations (it is a hotel restaurant) or perhaps we were looking for a Sunday meal, but we had a very good experience.  The room is nicely decorated, although it's a little odd that the windows face the resort hallway. The ambience is contemporary and low-lit, but suitable for kids in a pinch.   Overall the service was superb, perhaps the best part of the meal. Our waitress was full of energy, gave great suggestions and was attentive without being smothering. Plates were cleared on time, service was prompt, and even the bus boys were cordial.  Regarding the food - while the menu is a bit limited in scope (leaning towards the steakhouse and sides concept) there is enough to satisfy both meat eaters and fish eaters alike. We both happened to order fish (the seared salmon and the scallops and risotto). Both were excellent and we agreed that the high point of both meals was the truffle-infused risotto that came with the seared scallops (amazing stuff). My other favorite was the polenta \"fries\", essentially a crispy shell containing creamy polenta that is infused with pecorino romano and truffles. Unbelievable comfort food (I could have had that as my meal).  Wine list is good, but pricey - we found some good less expensive options but be prepared for a heavy price tag if you order Cabs. Deserts were good overall but not as creative as the menu reflects. However, the popovers that come as your bread course are sublime!!  In the end we both give this a thumbs up and look forward to coming back for the brunch, which multiple people have said is spectacular!",

I have been here before and loved it...even going so far as to call it one of the best restaurants in Charlotte if not the best. Last night, that was far from the case...and on Valentines Day too!  There were four of us in our party. We ordered a combination of the 3 course special menu and the regular a la carte menu. I had the lobster and truffle risotto which tasted so fishy I could not choke it down. My mom got the oysters Rockefeller which arrived like warm and salty as you can possibly imagine. My husbands butternut squash soup was also like warm and honestly tasted like something out of a Campbell's can (let's face it I've had better Campbell's). I sent mine back and got the mixed green salad instead. That was actually good although not outstanding which is what I expect from this type of restaurant.   Still trying to be positive we moved on to the next course. Out of 3 dishes bc my husband and dad got the same thing, 2 were sent back. The scallops were gritty, fishy and just plain gross. My mom's swordfish was also fishy and tasted just \"not fresh\" is how I can describe it. The only decent dish was my filet, which I still had to be sent back to have cooked correctly bc my medium came out just plain rare.  The dessert plate was decent and we did eat that, but all in all I was extremely underwhelmed and will NOT be dining here again unless they do something major with their kitchen. Even the manager seemed extremely inexperienced and barely uttered an apology for this disaster of a meal. Yuck!",

Despite a reservation at 1:30, we were seated at 2:10.  The service was what you'd expect at an Easter brunch that charges $20 per person.  On a typical weekend, this restaurant charges $25 per person.  The experience is commensurate with that kind of price point.  I will say that the food was well prepared and that there was a decent variety available.",

You can eat in fine dining Style with your typical upscale white Table cloths or if you have a toddler that is semi behaved and can be controlled with crayons or an iPhone :-) then the more relaxed pub like setting will do just fine. On the relaxed pub side there is a small bar and several tv's placed around. The food is standard but tasty and always fresh and flavorful!! The French onion soup is the best in Clt- ties with Georgges Brasserie! The portions are perfect and not chauncy! If you are ever looking for a relaxing, not snooty great place to go that serves your simple fare The Gallery is the place! The service is always superb with no Additudes on the side. Check out the menu- I Promise you shouldn't have regrets! The atmosphere is always very quiet, so dont go looking to people watch- we like Going for a weekend brunch or lunch- you can't beat the quality compared to so many other overpriced dives in The city!",

But breakfast from the menu (great salmon plate or omelet) or buffet are both great. They do a great Sunday breakfast buffet. The food choices are limited but all well selected and delicious. Go for the cold buffet and enjoy their excellent salmon. The fruit is fresh and the granola is as good as it gets same goes for their made in house pastries; over indulge in their blueberry muffins, they are worth it. For a special occasion call ahead and let them know what the occasion is. You will be made to feel special. It is a given that any food ordered there is excellent. If you are bored one afternoon try their bar (off of the Gallery) for  a relaxing drink and real tasty bar snacks. I forgot to mention they serve first rate coffee and I do not mean Starbucks. If all this sounds great but you are on a reduced budget go there for lunch, same great kitchen turning our that great food but a tiny bill at meal's end. You can't go wrong with their steak or scallops at lunch both have portion sizes that do not overwhelm (or make you feel guilty as you get up from the table). And with any meal order their coffee which is first class; if you are used to dinner or chain cafe coffee go here and taste what coffee should taste like.",

We opted for the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings also known as the adventure menu.  Nothing we were served was currently on the menu.  Our first course was amazing.  I had the fabulous french onion soup by special request.  There is a reason it is the best french onion soup in Charlotte.  My husband had a great shrimp and scallop cerviche.  This was the best dish of the night!  The delightfully warm gruyere popovers were fabulous and it was hard to hold back with all the food to come.  Our next two dishes were both a fresh fish.  Both were perfectly cooked.  One was served over a selection of matchstick vegetables with curry.  We thought it had a good balance.    The only dish that was a miss was the lamb. Meat didn't have a lot of flavor and the texture was not pleasing. It may not have been a good cut.  The mashed potatoes were wonderful.   The desserts were great!  My husband enjoyed a nice piece of cheesecake with a house made sour cherry topping and I had a yummy chocolate pralaine tort with an amazing artesian marshmellow and some chocolate \"art.\"  Dinner was at a nice leisurely pace as we were making an evening out of it.  The wine and scotch selections are extensive..",

We assumed they were complementary, when indeed they were not (nor were they very good). They were taken off the bill, but still had to deal with the hassle and delay. The odd server also informed us that he was ill (\"feeling queasy\" he told us) and that another server would be taking care of us. Obviously alarmed after being served food by this person.

Since it was a holiday, I kind of expected to wait.   When our waitress came to take our order I told her I was a vegetarian.  I got an awkward 20 seconds of silence and a deer-in-the-headlights stare from her; not what I was expecting.  I then told her I would just order some apps and sides.  Normally this would not phase me, BUT the person sitting at the next table also mentioned to her waitperson ( a different one than mine) that she was a non-meat eater and she got a totally different response.  Her waitperson went on to explain how the chef would make her a vegetable platter with a nice assortment of choices, etc etc. No problem, they would take care of her, etc etc.  I couldn't believe it!  My husband and I just stared at each other in disbelief.   If there is a vegetarian option, I would expect that ALL the wait staff should know about it and be able to verbalize it to guests especially at an establishment like Gallery.  I didn't want to cause a problem, so I just enjoyed my salad and au gratin potatoes and a very delicious dessert.  The food was great, just not a lot of options for a vegetarian.  On a positive note, the bartender was awesome! He was friendly, and apologetic about the wait and took good care of us. I'd definitely go back for drinks at the bar, not sure I would go back for dinner.  Too many other great restaurants in the area that understand that not everyone eats meat!",

I will start by saying it is very well decorated, well lit and welcoming.  Prices are about what you would expect for the location and the service was attentive and friendly. Breakfast, to be honest the food could have been better.  I ordered the California Omlette which had avacado, tomato, onion and I think turkey.  I say \"I think\" because the omlette was \"OK\" and I just don't remember anything about it, other than it was bland.  The breakfast potatoes were served cold.  The coffee there is wonderful however. Lunch was a complete 180 degree turnaround.  Started off with a popover which was great, almost \"eggy\" inside and a nice start to the meal.  I ordered the shaved leg of lamb sandwich which was quite possibly, one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.  I am a huge fan of well cooked lamb, and this was dead on.  Shaved leg of lamb, some sort of hummus on a nice roll.  The lamb was nicley cooked and flavorful with just the right amount of fat.  The fries were well cooked and of good consistency, which is important.  So many times restaurants have great sandwiches and crappy fries which takes away from the meal. The lunch experience will make me think about adding Gallery to my rotation of places to have lunch when I'm in Ballantyne.",

    "text": "This restaurant is only so so. It is billed as luxurious but it does not even come close to what I consider a luxury hotel restaurant. I have a family member in the hotel business and I have dined at many hotels and resort restaurants across the country that are far superior to this one. Each time I have eaten here, it feels like they are skimping on portions but charging you top dollar. And the dishes aren't very special, especially for the money paid.  I have eaten here twice, once for  brunch this past summer and today on Christmas. I have to say the food is overpriced and okay but  not great;  and the portions are small. Service seems somewhat slow as well. The first time I went for breakfast, I had an omelet which was nothing special. Others in our party got chicken and waffles  and shrimp and grits which they enjoyed but again the portions size was not adequate IMHO. Two members of the party did say the bloody mary's were good.   The Christmas menu sounded good in theory but the execution left something to be desired with regard to the prix fixe menu. There was a choice of a la carte menu or prix fixe dinner. I got the scallops from the a la carte which well cooked but you only got 4 medium sized scallops and some kind of inedible garnish for $32. I also did a french onion soup which was the BEST dish of the night- good portion, nice broth with onions nice cheesy big crouton which formed a creamy consistency with the broth- one of the best I have had ( I give credit where credit is due even if other aspects of the dining experience were disappointing). I had the whipped potatoes as a side dish and they were decent. I skipped desert. They had several types of interesting breads  to choose from with three types of butter which were quite good. But they act like it is gold. Instead of giving you a small bread basket with different choices, they come around and dole out the small pieces of bread in a piecemeal fashion one by one - what's up with that?  My husband got the prime rib on prix fixe menu, but it was some weird configuration. Instead of being the traditional sliced prime rib with au jus It was like they formed it into some kind of beef roll and cooked it, then sliced  as slab of meat, with horseradish and garlic and very little au jus. Even the server admitted that the chef had gone out on the limb and reimagined a classic instead of just serving a class prime rib. No where in the description did they explain it that way. The server SHOULD have make him aware that it was not the classic prime rib and really explained the dish. His meal included a cream of mushroom soup which he liked and a very pitiful looking small beet salad- he said that the portion should have been doubled to be like a real salad instead of a taste of beet salad.  The dinner also came with a choice of a eggnog and gingerbread dessert or a chocolate dessert. He chose the eggnog dessert.  Instead of giving you a whole piece of gingerbread poundcake, topped with eggnog ice cream and garnished which cream and small chocolates, they put a Tablespoon of eggnog ice cream on a plate, surrounded by some CUBES of gingerbread pound cake which was somewhat dry ( not an entire slice) along with some dollops of cream and about 2 small chocolate candies and some ginger slices- just pitiful. The prix fixe menu was $50.  Our entire meal with wine and a badly prepared old fashioned which was not properly mixed came to $148 with tip. NOT WORTH IT.  We did not want to cook  for Christmas, but we could have done better by buying a dinner at a local grocery store instead of dining here.   While we were dining we could see servers taking items to the bar as many people were dining in there. That food looked better that what was being served in the dining room. I doubt seriously I would return to this hotel to dine again.  I don't want to be disappointed again. There are too many other places to try in CLT, but if on chance we did go back, I would look at the bar menu instead of the Gallery Restaurant. Based on two experiences at this restaurant, I can't recommend it.",

During my most recent visit I enjoyed a beer and wonderful cheddar cheese and bacon sliders.  My friend had a great berry martini and fish tacos.  Her two generous fish tacos were more than enough for a meal and got two thumbs way up!  The bar has the best atmosphere and the most comfortable seating. Even when it's crowded, you can always converse without having to raise you voice while continuing to sink back in comfy chairs.    They have wine and other drink specials and don't forget the great patio that overlooks the golf course when weather is great and the sky is Carolina Blue!",

Gallery feels very much like an average (not even resort) hotel restaurant, with a \"view\" of a hallway and unattractive decor. The bar is very nice, but the dining area is exceptionally plain.  Still, my husband hasn't stopped raving about the popovers, and the food and service were truly great. The wine list was also spectacular.",

Appetizers: my squash soup was delicious while my husband's french onion was \"the worst he has ever had\".  Next our entrees: He had short ribs which had so much fat on them they were unappetizing. I had the chicken & dumplings which were so bland That I had to add lots of salt (I never add salt,but I was famished). After, we were both so humgry that we decided dessert Could not be worse so we shared the deconstructed bread pudding. We were so wrong! It was dry, tasted like whiskey and so inedible that our waiter was kind enough to take it off our bill. We are so sad since this is the only nice hotel in South Charlotte. Hope they take our review to heart and work on improving. However, it will be a long time before we return. I should add that the craft cocktails that we had at the bar before dinner were excellent!",

Stayed at hotel and everyone from the front desk to the bartenders recommended the Gallery and the rib cap steak. This was one of my WORST meals ever on a trip. Worst than NC Basketball played against ND tonight.  the premiere dish is the rib eye rib cap, but it really is 2 slices of meat. It comes with a quail egg, but mine was served with quail egg, well done. How can you get that yoke with a well done egg? Servers drop dishes all over the place, and it is run by kids who don't get exceptional dining and service experience for a 4 or 5 star hotel. Maybe because it's Starwood. Manager apologized and took care of an $8 glass of wine. Best of luck, but don't dine here. Money best spent elsewhere.",

The popover was excellent and the staff was wonderful, but the food (for the summer menu) was consistently mediocre, from the amuse bouche through the next four.

Maybe their dishes a la carte are better, and I really wanted to like it, but the tasting menu should present some of the best or at least most ambitious samples of the chef's oeuvre, and these fell flat.  For the server and ambiance and the decent-enough dishes, it gets 3 stars, but it was disappointing and I wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "This is part 2 of my review, posted as an update to my original.  The fourth course was grilled ribeye steak, with quail egg (sunny side up) over forbidden wild rice with black garlic and white asparagus. The steak was cooked at what I consider the perfect temp for ribeye, about 1/2 betwen mid-rare and medium (more red than pink, and warm). I wasn't familiar with black garlic before this...it has a very deep earthy flavor and has little in common with all other garlic preparations I've had, it was quite tasty and novel (for me). The egg was cooked exactly how I like them: sunny side up, runny yolk, and slightly caramelized whites around the edges giving a crispy texture. Despite this being done in every way perfectly....it was still 2nd the pork. The pork was just that good.  The fifth course was cheese. I can't recall the details here, and failed to get a picture as well :(  There was a semi-soft Italian cheese (my wife and Salvatore had been discussing their shared Italian heritage throughout the first 4 courses), and a firm Spanish cheese, onion relish, candied beets, and something I have completely forgotten the name of. It was kind of like a fine dining version of frosted flakes...very nicely balanced the saltiness and uniform texture of the cheeses. The onion relish was very nicely done as well, the onions still had enough texture to contrast with the cheese, but no crunch left at all. The candied beets were almost like a flexible art glass in their deep color and translucency.   The 5th course was dessert. Chocolate Torte, a cherry turnover, and a graham cracker ice cream. This was definitely the weakest of the 6 courses--which isn't surprising, neither my wife nor I are big dessert eaters and rarely order it. The torte was unremarkable, but well-executed. Ditto the turnover. The ice cream however was a surprise and a delight. Nicely made ice cream with a modest overrun and deep graham cracker flavor, with a few crunchy bits here and there to vary the texture.  This was the best meal I've ever had in a restaurant...and I eat in a lot of fine dining restaurants (though I rarely have anything other than an app + entree). I have paid a great deal more, gotten a greal deal less, and been happy about it. this was one of the best values in fine dining I've ever seen as well.  I realize that this review is extremely positive, perhaps even gushing. I assure you I do not usually write reviews like this....I have quite a few of them on Yelp! so you can check me. I will certainly criticize when I see a need, this was just a genuinely amazing experience.   I have uploaded photos of each course to Yelp...except the cheese course which was devoured before thinking of the camera.",

    "text": "Gallery is one of the few hotel restaurant with food that is actually good! I sampled several items, as I came with a group of other ladies who all ordered different items. I then returned the following week with family.  Items samples/ordered:  Sweet potato hash-small bits of sweet potatoes sauteed up with onions and red peppers-had a great taste.   Petite Belgian Waffle-3 mini waffles served with pears on the side. The waffles were sweet and fluffy, the pears were cut into cute mini-circles, but were not otherwise memorable.  Shrimp and Grits-The grits were creamy and rich, and like most other grits, these did not require salt. The shrimp atop the grits and the bits of sausage in the dish were full of flavor, but the temperature of the dish was only lukewarm on both visits.  Calamari-served with a tasty aioli dipping sauce-ask for all rings when your order-my girlfriend had  1/2  a bowl of tentacles in the bottom of the bowl, which she did not like. I requested all rings on my 2nd visit, and the waitress accommodated my request.   Apple French Toast-I am not a fan of French toast, but this one was good, although it was not warm at all.  They offer several cocktails, mimosas, etc, but you cannot order before 12 noon on Sunday. The drink menu was presented on an IPAD type device which you can scroll through, which was cool.  They also serve a variety of (cold) bread, muffins, and biscuits with breakfast, but at least the butter was soft and spreadable. They offer a trio of jellies/jams/apple butter, which are fun to pass around the table and share.   Service can range from friendly to spotty-on my 2nd visit, we had to specifically request our jam/jelly trio, and also had to request our to-go boxes twice. Otherwise, we enjoyed the food and the experience, and I would return.",

The menu was a bit out-there and seemed like it was trying too hard to be upscale (WTH is tat soi?), but ultimately the entrees were approachable - BBQ sandwich, burger, caesar salad. I thought the prices were a bit high for such basic fare - despite their attempt to \"elevate\" our experience, a burger is still a burger. Our server seemed a bit overwhelmed with 7 of us, even though the restaurant was not full. The drink orders took forever and then came out wrong, which did not bode well for the rest of our meal. However the food came quickly and everyone's dish was perfectly presented. I was pleasantly surprised. Portions are decent for lunch. The complimentary bread basket was a big hit (crusty white bread, some kind of cheesy focaccia, and seed bread with sunflower seeds maybe...? yum!). Overall I would say a great place for business lunches/dinners and more elegant events.",

    "text": "The Gallery Restaurant is located on the right most wing of the Ballantyne Westin Resort on the 1st floor. They have a restaurant and bar, with a separate bar menu if you want to order smaller plates. The kitchen closes at 10pm so make sure you get there in time!  The burgers here are gigantic and delicious. Like every other restaurant in Charlotte, there is a rule that you cannot cook anything under 144 degrees (medium well), but they are still flavorful and juicy. They serve it with a generous side of onion rings or sweet potato fries.  This restaurant has a bar and restaurant, and the food and drinks are priced reasonably compared to the Westin in downtown. I ordered a small plate $10 worth of scallops which was a mere 2 scallops with a delicious side of pea shoot salad and candied watermelon. I washed it down with North Carolina blueberry port.   If you're hungry, the highest value small plate are the fish tacos.  If you want variety you can get a 5 course or 7 course meal that starts at $69.  They offer whiskey tastings and have a good variety of top shelf alcohols including a slew of top shelf whiskeys. The bartender is friendly and knowledgeable about everything.   I would definitely return if I stayed here again.  Just a couple tips about the regular menu: - Duck was excellent, moist, and tasty. - Porkchop was very dry and lacked flavor, it needed sauce. - The Fillet was surprisingly good considering this place isn't a steakhouse. - They have fried mac n cheese tots.  - The fries are great!  The waitress at the bar is grouchy and mean. The waiter is much nicer but doesn't know anything about wine.",

But the duck is ok but can barely fill an athletic person (if you are an athlete training for long distance sports).  Taste: i liked both dishes. The duck is flavorful.   Speed of food preparation: they are on the slow side. Especially between my flatbread and the duck. The wait was over 15 minutes  Atmosphere: i decided to sit at the bar. That was a good choice as the scene is a bit more social and there is a tv.   Service: Lauren, the waitress, who served me is great. She was fun to chat with and energetic.  All in all: a good 4 stars restaurant",

The manager only provided me $21 of the unused $75 gift card. The server treated me as if I was lying when I told him there was more on the card. If I had not brought the proof of purchase it would have been completely dismissed. I would NEVER recommend anyone to purchase a gift card at Ballantyne resort because it will depreciate in value every month and the staff will not honor the full purchase price. This is not how you gain repeat customers and I will never voluntarily return.",

    "text": "We had a group of eight adults and 4 children, with reservations. The evening started off really good, with cocktails in the Lobby, which we served ourselves.($150)  Once called to our table, we ordered Appetizers and Bottles of Wine.  Then, we ordered entrees, Apps were served and then things hit a wall.  We sat for an hour and a half, drinking more wine & water and waiting for food.  After an hour and a half, I walked to the kitchen serving area and asked if we could get our food; explained it had been an hour and a half and we were getting ready to leave, as it was close to 10:00 p.m.  The food was served about 5 minutes later.  The Tuna dishes were very raw and cold, the Pork Chops had been cooked, lost most of the their heat, and served in cold dishes. Our birthday person and her husband had ordered the Tomahawk Steak, which was the meal that our server kept saying was delaying our order, and when served, it was semi-warm, well done on one side and rare on the other.  We complained to management and they took the all the tuna off the bill.  Pay'ed a bill of about $750 plus 20%, ($150) so the waiter didn't get stiffed.  To sum it all up.....We spent $1,050 to $1,100 for an evening of sub par food, with meal preparation beyond slow, and presentation temperatures unheard of in an establishment this price point and caliber.  Charlotte contains many other establishments that far exceed the food quality and consistent delivery of quality preparation.",

    "text": "This was a very disappointing evening so could well be rated a one-star.  To say it was A-OK is simply not True.  Too many not so great aspects.  It is terribly expensive, certainly a business expense kind of restaurant and there were plenty of such there that Wednesday evening.  Wife and I went with our neighbors so the four of us had a 7pm reservation.  We were excited as none of us had eaten here.  We were greeted in the bar by the hostess who seated us in the rather plain dining area.  Behind us was a table set for 14 or more and there was one other table set for 12, which later would prove to greatly disrupt the service and servers.  Our server greeted us and as he handed us a notebook which had the wine and cocktail listings he mentioned that we might want to choose our meal options because of the two large groups coming in.  We were in-sync with his thinking, so we got with it.  We each had a glass of wine to go with out meals and ordered appetizers.  Wife and I shared an onion soup $8 and I had oysters $18 for six of them.  Our neighbors had onion soup $8 and split a deviled egg and beet salad $14.  The onion soup did not measure up to Sullivan's or Beef and Bottle, let alone others.  The onions were not caramelized and had a raw taste to them.  And the broth was thin and lacked much flavor.  The oysters had a caviar cream mini-dollop with vinegar so I scrapped that off and ate them with hot sauce and lemon.  They were OK, but very expensive.  We sat until after 8pm wondering where our main dishes were.  In that hour of sitting the two large tables filled.  Noise level rose substantially enough as it was hard to talk at our table.  At 8:15 our main courses arrived.  They looked pretty.  Ii ordered the Monk Fish $32 which consisted of a narrow four inch piece of pan seared fish sitting on a pile of beans and sausage slices.  A fennel sauce/cream was described but it was not distinctive to recognize.  The fish was nicely cooked and when I was asked how it was my reply was, \"Nothing special.\"  And so it was.  The two ordered the beef tenderloin $42 each, which was a card deck sized steak mounted on a potato puree with mushrooms and sauce.  The beef eaters commented that it was a good quality piece of meat, but was too dry.  They asked our server for more sauce and that helped greatly.  The other lady ordered the duck breast $34 which she said was quite good.  I will mention that our server and basically all the other servers were diverted to handle the large tables.  We anticipated that, but we had to work to get their attention during our meal and to order coffee and dessert.  It was after 9pm when we got our coffee and a little later our two desserts.  The desserts were the chocolate millefeuille $10 and the orange gianduja tart $10.  They sounded and read better than they were.  I had a Drambuie $8.50 and two others had coffee $2.50 each.  We each sampled the desserts and found that they were so dry.  They were beautiful, but even with the ice cream, jam and ganache they stuck to the top of your mouth and needed to be washed down.  Golly!  Our server was really stretched, but he did as best as he could.  As we finished out desserts the large tables emptied, much to every one's relief.    The bill was $307 and we tipped the server $100.  I do tip on the high side as I understand what it is to work for a living.  So over $400 for an evening of so-so food in a plain, noisy setting that lasted two and a half hours.  In the car home conversation we agreed that the meal was over priced and that The Gallery was not our cup of tea.  If you want the facade of elegance at a premium price...go for it.  But for us, two retired business executives and our wives, you could do far better, getting more for less.",

Me and my fiance were very impressed with our experience here. The service was very prompt and friendly, thanks to Sal and friends :)  I would say the scallop ceviche and the cowboy ribeye were my faves. The ceviche came with plantain chips which really added a nice crunchy element.  Don't be afraid to salt it a bit, that will really set off the jalapeno and lime flavors. The steak came with foie gras butter and wild mushrooms, yum!  I was not afraid to pick up the bone and munch on the crispy goodness.  My fiance enjoyed the desserts the most, of course. The tres leches cake with strawberry sorbet was amazing. The other was an assortment of chocolatey, coffee, crumbly goodness with gold flake, so fancy!  The rest of the meal: crab corn chowder (make sure to add a little of the house pepper blend), awesome gruyere and fennel popovers, a fresh salad with goat cheese and blueberry vinaigrette, butter poached asparagus, charred brussel sprouts, seared duck breast with spicy prosciutto, and a couple of other tasty morsels that Sal kept surprising us with.   We both are looking forward to our next visit. I'm curious to see how the menu changes with the seasons :)",

I would recommend the Gallery for a date night, or nice quiet evening out.  -James",

We came for brunch, we ordered the almond chia pudding to start and the presentation was phenomenal. I love how they can turn an ordinary everyday food, to something 5 star worthy. I'm a sucker for nice plating, we eat w/ our eyes too lol! I had the crab cake Benedict the crab was so flavorful & not fishy at all. I also love the assortments of complimentary bakery items that they give each table. You MUST check out this restaurant if you have not been, it's also located in a hotel! We live about 45 minutes away from Ballantyne but I definitely will go out of my way to come back here soon(:",

The restaurant itself is nicely appointed with art and decor. The menu is seasonal and does change so I'd recommend looking at the menu ahead of time if you are a picky eater. Service last visit was slow, but it was during restaurant week on a weekend, so that wasn't surprising. This spot also has great brunch as well.",

    "text": "I have to admit after reading the reviews I was a little nervous about eating here, but I'm glad we did.  We were staying at the Ballantyne Hotel as a 'get-away' from Charlotte.    The service was excellent.  It started with the host who was very friendly.  From the person that brought us water to the waiter, all were very nice.  Billy was not our server, but came by to help us and provide some descriptions about the food we had.  This was great!  I love when a waiter makes recommendations.  If I go back, I will ask for him!  WHen you walk in you are offered cucumber, lemon or lime for your water.  What a nice touch!  Then your choice of 4 types of bread and a selection of 3 butters.  The pesto butter was the only thing  a bit lacking in flavor the entire night.    My husband and I shared the following: 1- PETITE PORK SHANK  black eyed pea dumpling, collard green chow-chow- I rarely order pork, but for some reason this description intrigued me.  It was the star of the meal IMO.  The black eyed pea dumpling was small and a little more like a fritter, but still added to the dish.  The pork was fall off the bone.  I think I'd go back and order 2 of these for my meal :)  2-French Onion soup-very good and tasty, but relatively typical F.O. soup  3-SEA SCALLOP smoked coral butter sauce, hemp nut pie crust, chickpea, carrot, potato-This was a very good dish. I didn't think the accompaniments would excite me, but they were good.  The scallops were tasty, but some were just a tad overcooked.  Still really enjoyed them.  4-I wish I could remember for sure, but I believe the fish we had was barrelfish with green beans.  I had never heard of it before, and we were pleasantly surprised.  This dish beat the scallops and I was very surprised.  Excellent flavor!  If I was in the Ballantyne area, looking for a good meal I would visit here again.  I believe they also did the room service breakfast we had at the hotel.  We had the omelets and potatoes and they were very tasty-particulary the veggie omelet.",

Twice  we were here because Tim was playing golf here & we wanted to have drinks & dinner on the patio as soon as he finished. The other visit we were having a \"staycation\" & were just enjoying the resort. All 3 times, we requested al fresco dining out on the patio.   They have some serious issues bringing food & drinks in a timely manner when you dine outdoors! For some reason they just can't seem to get it together.  Last night we were there from 6:30-9:30. Thankfully, we were not in a hurry...no where to go afterwards, but they were just painfully slow.  Our server last night was rather a cranky fellow and made a couple of snarky comments that made me question why he's in the service industry. However, Tim took pity on him and tipped him well but quite frankly, I am not sure I would have been as generous.",

Loverly atmosphere, nice menu and very nice service.  The only problem is the food. I ordered the Flounder filet with some sort of curry sauce. The sauce was served cold ( I asked for it to be heated) and the 2 skimpy fish filets were over-cooked and dry. I sent it back and refused to order another dish. Didn't think the chef deserved another chance.  The dish was $34 with no sides. They over charge and under deliver. My wife ordered the chicken and dumplings.  No flavor. I was embarrassed that I had chosen this restaurant.  This will not happen again.",

I get it - it's a very high end hotel - but the dinner menu is just a bit TOO eclectic.  I mean really - crystallized basil ?, plantation quail ?  Minted garden pea & hemp salad, honeyed Malbec, bruleed lardo ????   I am a foodie, I love food, cook food and have worked in (high end) food service my whole life and I understand about three words in that last item!   With that said - they get 7 stars !! on service.  It is exquisite.  Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner are all fabulous.  Breakfast and Lunch menus are more approachable and the best damned sweet potato fries I've ever had (Went to a BBQ place down the road and theirs don't even compare!) Expand menu or scale back on the weird stuff and it will be perfect !",

While we hit it near St. Valentine's Day when the menu was limited, the overall quality of the food, service and atmosphere just can't be beat.  We always sit in the bar on a sofa or love seat for two.  Derek encourages us to sit the night, ordering items as we go.  I ordered the salmon - the modest portion was fine, given we were ordering lots of apps, anyway, but for most, it probably would have left them wanting.  It was wonderful: sweet, juicy, fresh and slightly seared on the outside to give it that perfect combination of texture and flavor.  We just can't find this kind of ambiance quality and service anywhere else in the Charlotte area.  We especially love being greeted and then afforded privacy.   It's professional service.",

We went to the pool and needed to get some food, but didn't want to leave. After deciding the bar wasn't our style, we went the Gallery.   It was an incredible experience! I really can't say enough. The kids menu wasn't exactly what I had in mind, but they were so accommodating to sub our chickens and side for something healthier/knew he would eat.   I ordered the mussels. There were a bit spicy, but so good. My mom got the roasted chicken. It's chicken - no big deal. That would be wrong. It was so good. The French onion soup was one of the best I ever had.

    "text": "We had never dined here for breakfast, so we decided on a spontaneous splurge the Saturday morning of the NBA All-Star game. Regardless of how posh they may be, resort restaurants can be hit-or-miss. Our breakfast experience was more miss than hit.  Even at 9:30, the dining room was sparsely occupied, so we immediately scored a cozy booth. If it matters to you, decor has been updated from its original classic southern manor style to a colder, contemporary one  from the wood floors to the abstract art hanging on the walls. Personally, I prefer the prior classical style.   Service was outstanding ranging from the friendly hostess, to our server, to the manager who twice dropped by our table to ensure everthing was okay. Even the busboys were engaging.  Now, about the food... Our meal began with a complimentary basket of muffins, breads and danishes along with butter and a side tray of delightful jellies and jams. This was a very nice touch and really left us with high expectations for our meal.  My wife ordered the Southern Eggs Benedict, which ran about $15 and was served over a sliced biscuit instead of the usual English muffin. It was served with a side of sliced fingerling potatoes unfortunately it arrived cold. To their credit, the server sincerely apologized, brought a replacement, and notified us that it would be stricken from our bill. The manager also apologized. Hey you can't ask a whole lot more than that but when all was said and done, it and the side were just okay. (By the way, for the best Benedict in town at half the price, try the OPH in Southpark.)  I chose the Shrimp and Grits and found it to be somewhat bland. It is served with four or five large prawns, and topped with fresh herbs and presented artistically. It was piping hot.  So overall, what can I say? While it is always a nice diversion visiting the Ballantyne Resort, breakfast in the Gallery is just okay. Dinner, however, we have found to be a bit better. Fortunately the area is saturated with other options.",

I guess all the golfers were trying to get a round in when the weather cleared up for the day, because once we actually found a spot (nowhere near the door!), there were relatively few folks inside, and they had to be somewhere, right?  Service was solid, right from the beginning where they offer you a paper and an escort to your seat. The servers are friendly and seem happy to see you even if you are - like us, or at least me - definitely not a guest of the resort.  When it comes to the food, it's decent, but I'm not sure if I would really go far out of the way to try it again. Like many places, it sounds a lot better on the menu than what you actually receive, and between that and having to fight for a spot to park, it just may not be worth the effort. Nice for a visit, but I don't know if it would be on the regular circuit.",

Words here would not do it justice.  It was perfect.  The flavors...oh ma' Lord the flavors.  Fresh pita, delectable feta cheese.  Had a side of the sweet potato fries which were also very good.... but....  THAT LAMB BURGER.  Oh my!",

I would recommend calling in to make a reservation prior to coming since it's quite small and you wouldn't have to wait too long for a table. I wish we sat on the patio, it's a gorgeous view outside! I ordered the Salmon Frittata and it was delicious! The saltiness of the smoked salmon balanced well with the egg. I did not love the potatoes it came with. It's a huge slice of potato, which I feel made it harder to eat but maybe that's just me.   GET THE ALMOND CHIA PUDDING! It was sooo yummy and the presentation is beautiful. I tried the Corn Soup and the lump crab in it is huge and was so satisfying to eat. They gave us a ton of muffins and bread as starters with a variety of jams and butter. The people that work here are super friendly as well.",

I got the tostada and ordered the egg over hard. When it came out, the egg still had a runny yolk which I can't eat. I was just going to not eat it, but my aunt told me to say something. When I told the waiter, he came back and took the when saying he needed to prove to the kitchen that it wasn't cooked right. That was a little off putting as I would expect them to just bring out a new egg without questioning. They ended up bringing me out an entirely new meal which was very accommodating so I can't fault them too much.   If you're in the area, this is a pretty good place to stop. Also note that they have Gingerbread Lane right outside around Christmas!",

It's a little more laid back, and they still offer the full menu!   They constantly add new menu items or update some of the regular items with season ingredients. I wish I could tell the \"one dish\" to order, but everything here is absolutely amazing!! The soups and salads are delicious! And I strongly suggest you check out the Gallery Cut!! This changes weekly, but is typically a different red meat option.   As for the bar, they have a wide selection of spirits. This is a bourbon bar though, so you will be able to find bourbons here that you may not see at other restaurants.   This is really one of our favorite restaurants her favorite in charlotte. We try to make it here once a week. If you're in the area definitely check it out. Jameson and Jessica are typically at the bar and they are fantastic!! Tell them I sent you!",

    "text": "I've had tea at the resort and used the spa but never tried the restaurant. So we decided to check it out during restaurant week. I know my review is very late in coming, but I needed time to really reflect on my experience. I won't lie it wasn't a very good one, however after some time I can say it wasn't as bad as I believed in the moment. Confused? Me too!! Haha so I will divide this into service and food.   Starting with the food... the calamari, listed as crispy, was anything but. Definitely a waste of money!! Their bread selection was delicious, but if you are a table of two they won't leave the basket assortment they make you choose. Tell you that you can have as much as you want etc. but honestly it's very weird and off-putting like you're begging for more bread. Awkward! The table next to us got a basket for the table, but they had more people. The steaks and crispy potatoes were to die for, seriously their chef can cook a steak perfectly!!! So all three stars are for that alone!! Desert was good but nothing I'd order again.   On to service. I'm so conflicted with this, because at the time I was really angry about it all. We showed up early and the hostess was a bit haughty with us and told us we had to wait at the bar. What she said was fine, but the manner in which she said it was not. The bartender treated us as if we were lacking since we aren't fond of whiskey or scotch and 99% of their drinks have that as their basis. I still tipped her, but honestly I'd never go back to the bar. Golf playing men we are not and we clearly weren't welcome. Our waiter... sigh he was nice. However again we were treated like we didn't belong, and he hovered off to the side a lot. I felt like we were being watched in case we ran out on the check. I ordered my steak rare and he literally kept mansplaining what a rare steak will come out like. Now I get it, a lot of people will order a rare steak and then send it back because they didn't realize what a rare steak is supposed to be like and they complain. Their chef 100% knows and I was impressed. However he asked me 5, count it FIVE times if I was sure and explained each and every time. Then he did the same thing to my friend when she ordered hers rare plus. We were just very much treated like we didn't know what we were doing and that we didn't belong there. Looking back I believe the staff was trying to be nice and they weren't being malicious. However they seem to have made assumptions about us that aren't True. I doubt anything will make me go back.",

While i had a great view of the Ciel Gallery artwork and the lovely decor, I was very uncomfortable because I was underdressed and people (customers and staff) gave me some odd looks.   On to the food. When things are prepared as to go, you typically don't get the same presentation as dining in with plating, etc. But i was expecting something halfway presentable. The French toast was thrown in the box. Flavors of the nutella and strawberries.. The strawberries were my favorite, very delectable. I couldn't decide if the nutella was a good or bad pairing.. I changed my mind after each bite. I think perhaps a lemon curd along with the strawberries would have balanced out the flavor better.   For $12 +tax, it was a bit underwhelming. However, I may dine-in next time to give it another chance.",

I selected the chorizo skillet and my husband had the chicken and waffles. They were both very good. We were both amazed at the flavor in the chicken. Past experiences have shown that when a \"hotel restaurant\" serves chicken, it has ZERO flavor. Doug was our server and he was very polite and responsive to my questions.",
