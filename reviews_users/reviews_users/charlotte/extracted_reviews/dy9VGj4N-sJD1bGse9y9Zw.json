My favorite item is the tuna sandwich, which is easily the best tuna sandwich that I have ever had. Everything that I have tried on the menu is delicious, you can't go wrong. The sides are a bit light, but it isn't about the sides, its about the freshest seafood you can get anywhere else in the area with unique recipes. There is also a mailing list that updates you daily with the menu for that day. I have brought many people here to try it out and I would recommend it to anyone who loves fresh fish.",

I love the fact that they carry local and wild-caught seafood instead of the farm raised, imported products from SE Asia that other outlets sell. The extra amount they charge for this quality is well worth it.  I hope that they keep up the great work.",

From the lunch menu i ordered the corn chowder with  shrimp and andouille sausage and a shrimp po boy. The chowder was THE BEST I've ever eaten. Chunks of shrimp and sausage are complemented by a zesty but not too spicy chowder. The fried shrimp Po boy was crunchy and the remoulade sauce light and tangy. My lunch companions had smoked salmon BLT and blackened grouper sandwiches. They raved about how good they were. As we were eating a long line of customers stood at the counter. Some were ordering fresh fish and seafood to take home to cook. Others took prepared food as takeout. I can't wait to go back again to try another item. I understand the menu changes depending on what fresh fish is available. Lunch and limited dinner hours are posted on their website.",

The service is friendly; I ordered at the counter and the food was brought to me along with my drink.  During the meal they checked if my drink needed refills or was there anything else I needed. Small out of the way spot, clean and bright and the best friend fish sandwich that I have had in years. If you know the difference between fresh fish and the other kind, then you will love this place.",

I had the blackened grouper sandwich. The jalapeno mayo on it was fantastic. My coworker had the mahi reuben and he said it was one of the better sandwiches he's had lately. I'll be trying that sandwich next time but its a special so it comes and goes. I had fries this time around which were ok, go with the slaw...it's really good.   I really like the creative tastes they put together here for their dishes. I'll be going back soon to move through a few more of the sandwiches I saw that I have to try. This place is on the up so stop in and enjoy some seafood.   You have to order at the counter when you walk in and then sit down. Someone will bring your drink and food out to you. You can't tip when you use a credit card because it isn't offered when you order. Either bring some cash or you're not going to leave a tip. The service is really good here so bring some cash.",

My tuna steak brought tears to my eyes and I was smacking and hold my sandwich like it was a work of art. The tuna was cooked just slightly nicely and tasted so fresh and flavorful. The spicy glaze on the steak hit the spot.  You know how your significant other sees you in enjoying your meal and plays that game do you want half of mine and we share, well today my answer was \"heck no\". I would definitely order another the next time in the neighbor. The wife had the Po Boy and the shrimp was cooked perfect and was overloaded nothing skimpy here.

    "text": "Ok ok so I may have been dragging my feet on writing this review. I wanted to keep Deep Sea all to myself!! Muah hahahah...  This place is amazing. Deep Sea is a seafood market that sells the freshest seafood around, from 11-2 Monday through Saturday it turns into a lunch spot. It is quite unassuming from the outside. You walk into a simple, clean space. The menu changes daily depending on what is fresh that day. There are a few items that you will always see on the menu. My favorites so far... Any version of the tuna Sandwich, Mahi Mahi Tacos, and the Blackened Catfish Po'Boy. You have two options for sides, steak fries or cilantro slaw. I always get the cilantro slaw. Which is fresh and not mayo heavy. The cilantro adds a pleasant zing to the side. I would be really excited it they added more side choices - maybe a salad or soup option would be nice.   They have a small seating area with 5 tables total. The tables fill up during peak lunch times. My suggestion, grab your lunch to go and find a nice bench to eat it on and enjoy the outdoors. The man at the counter seems a bit gruff and unfriendly but he is a good guy.   Next time you are around this part of town, make sure you stop and give Deep Sea a try! You won't be disappointed!",

Deep sea is essentially a seafood shop that serves lunch and more recently dinner, tucked away off Monroe road in an unassuming strip mall. I had read about it somewhere and decided to try it out; I'm glad I did, we are now regulars!. If you go for lunch, order your food at the counter then find a table. It seats maybe 28 max and is always busy. Lunches run around $10 give or take, and it's some of the freshest fish you'll find in Charlotte. Presentation is always top notch. Recently they began serving dinner...I had to admit I wondered who would want to go out for dinner to a fish shop. You know who? Me!  They start serving dinner at 5pm and step up the class, lights are dimmed, silverware and nice table mats, music from Larry's fabulous record collection playing in the background. It's BYOB with a reasonable corkage fee of $2.50 per person. No parties larger than 6 because it's a small place. Next time you want fabulous seafood, step outside your norm and head over to see Larry and Traci. Good food, good people.",

While I can't attest for the raw product, I can tell you this place gives ANY seafood restaurant a run for it's money when it comes to lunch.   Lunch is serves 11-2pm on weekdays and on Saturdays.  The space isn't fancy, and you just order at the counter, but I swear, the mahi-mahi bahn mi sandwich really had me scheming on when I could go back next.  The fish was perfectly cooked, spiced and on a bed of pickled veggies and cilantro. Granted, the bun wasn't a crusty French roll, like a bahn mi should be on, but the soft and hole-y cibatta was actually perfect for sopping up all the excess juices.  The fries were a pleasant surprise too.  Big and hand cut, browned and skins on.  Nice toothy bite, but soft and not too salty.    The service is friendly and honestly, the space is much less pretentious than some other fish markets in town.    BONUS: I'm pretty sure I saw a sign indicating the sustainability of the products they sell.  Nice!",

    "text": "Stumbled upon Deep Sea after my husband read about it in the Charlotte Agenda. The store doubles as a seafood market (closes at 5pm daily) and restaurant (lunch and dinner).  What's good: - fried shrimp platter (oyster combo is good too but prefer shrimp) - clam chowder - fish of the day - blackened or sauteed - clam bake (steamed whole lobster, clams, mussels, shrimp, corn and sausage) -desserts - most of their desserts are homemade and they are worth the unnecessary calories!  Not so good: - fries - these are often undercooked and lacks crispiness  I heard their fish tacos and the elusive lobster sandwich are good. I would suggest that they put less mussels and more shrimp and sausage in their clam bake bowls. I have yet to try their market portion as we usually go to Clean Catch for sushi grade salmon or tuna, but one day we'll give their sushi grade fish a try.  It's also BYOB with a corkage fee or $2.50/person. Not bad at all!  They've been busier lately since the Charlotte Agenda article and may need to staff up on the weekends to meet the high demand. Two servers for a full restaurant and waiting parties did not suffice, but they did their best.  Check it out!  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tripadvisor.com%2FShowUserReviews-g49022-d6665761-r399694402-Deep_Sea_Seafood_Market-Charlotte_North_Carolina.html&s=0ea10729cfec742925480bdbda227bd806e0c11afbd07445942fcd414ca7ceea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tripadvisor.com/ShowUser...</a>",

Stuffed portabello cap was plenty large enough for two people and not too bready or salty. Large bites of shrimp in it! Flounder with lemon sauce and capers was cooked just right, not at all greasy or salty, very light sauce and served with rice and plenty of asparagus. Pecan trout was very lightly crusted and the fish was cooked perfectly, again not greasy or salty, with rice and asparagus. Prices are where you'd expect (mid-teens per entree). My only suggestion would be to offer more alternatives to rice for a starch (baked potatoes, orzo salads, beans, lentils, etc). I was sad to see that we were the only customers at 6pm on a Tuesday.. maybe the word on dinner just hasn't gotten out yet? I'll be back - regularly!",

It's hidden in a small strip mall and sandwiched between two auto repair stores, which normally wouldn't herald a great seafood place, but this place defies the odds! They have a dine-in menu which changes daily. Lunch consists of po-boys, grilled fish sandwiches and fish & chips. They have a daily soup special, which is always a winner, and most sandwiches come with a side of steak fries. The dinner menu is a bit elevated, with a fresh catch special each evening. It's affordable and casual, but kind of a neat place since it is small and cozy. They also have a take-out counter where you can buy fresh-caught seafood to take home and prepare yourself. We bought a pound of sockeye salmon and it was incredible!",

Our very first initial thought was a little skeptical because the 2 of us tried to sit at a table for 4 (we got there 30 minutes before it closed on a Wednesday night), and we spotted the sign that said \"If you're a party of 2, sit at a table for 2!\" The guy quickly asked us to change tables (even though there were a lot of empty tables). He seemed a little irritated we were going to sit there. Our actual waiter (Anthony), however, was very nice and laid back.   We ordered a shrimp po boy with cilantro slaw and an oyster po boy with slaw. I would've liked to have tried one of their entrees, but it was higher than my budget allowed (to clarify, I do not think it was overpriced at all... just didn't have a lot of money to spend on dinner last night). The sandwiches were very nice and flavorful. The bread was soft and a great compliment to the seafood. The jury is still out for me with the cilantro slaw. I usually like cilantro, but I just couldn't eat a lot of the slaw.  I would like to go back again when I've got more money to taste some of their entrees. They close a little early as well (again, not a bad thing... you just have to be organized).",

    "text": "Well what another great find!  The Deep Seafood Market showcases a display of fresh fish at their see through counter space.   There is a smattering of tables around the restaurant for inside diners.  We came in and went to the counter and were presented with the daily menu.   After placing our orders, we quickly found a table.   No other people were dining inside, but it was a rather late lunch.  There is nothing fancy about this place at all.  Plain and simple.  My order was the fish and chips.  It was served on a paper plate.  The fish was fried cod.   The portion size was appropriate, but I wish there had been just a bit more of the cod and a few more fries on the plate. Better for my diet that the plate didn't have more!   Tasty slaw on the side.  It was really the star of the show!   Even if you are not a slaw fan, get it!   The tartar sauce was also good, even though I used a lot of malt vinegar on all the fried stuff on my plate.  Oh yes, it was ALL fried!   We noticed that there was a steady stream of people coming in to get take outs.  My guess is that the majority of their business is take out.   It is a perfect option for either take out or inside dining, if you're in the mood for seafood.   Two thumbs up! I look forward to returning.",

I was glad they extended their hours to dinner bc I'm just too busy during the day with work. I love the selection of fresh scallops and shrimp,  things here will cost more , but the taste is unbeatable.    As for the food , that kept me from giving deep seafood market 5stars. My seafood Cobb was pretty bland , there was no seasoning on the seared tuna, or the salmon and shrimp,  it actually probably was pre-made earlier that day so that's a frown upside down for my taste buds.  My partner and daughter ordered the Jumbo shrimp entree with steak fries . The fries were a little too thick for our liking, a few were actually not cooked all the way through, and the shrimp , eh, besides the size and freshness, again no seasoning . I would have to say I prefer just purchasing the seafood and cooking it myself, not really a fan of what I have sampled ,but this will not defer me from trying other menu selections in the future .   Either way, I would like to say kudos for the selection of seafood , and I'm  not sure what's up with the previous reviews on service, but the owner with the glasses was pleasant as well as sociable with us, and other customers while we were there .",

    "text": "Today's events deserve every bit of this and this is how things unfolded.  Backstory: I saw from Yelper Nikki they offered Lobster Rolls. So I inboxed to learn if it's Regular with Mayo or Connecticut with Butter. I was told they don't offer mayo but it's also not a daily menu item.   I asked for information on the next serving date and it wasn't known so I signed up for daily email alerts. Last night, I received an email notice the Roll would be served today so I actually replied with a thanks (yep, it's a mass email) and made plans to only eat Deep Sea for Friday.   I took the 30 minute drive in the pouring rain today along 485 with some scary drivers (some sped some slowed down that's how hard the rain down pour was rolling) to exit on 52 and arrived at the restaurant at 12:25p to a fully seated area and 5 people in line ahead of me. I checked in as I stood. I took a picture. Absorbed my surroundings and finally saw a menu for the day with a price. I texted about the price which isn't bad in NY but off putting since I had every plan of ordering enough to feed the squad. My goal was to dine in and enjoy mine and take the rest for the road. Well, remember that fully seated area? I noticed two tables - four tops available so I figured someone would move by the time I get my order in.  ** Or I'd ask to dine with other patrons - yeah I'm that Hibachi or Family style dining lady ** It's no big deal.   Proceed to scan the room for available seats. No one else has arrived so I should be good. I wanted to take more pictures but I try to avoid including people in pictures.   Lady ahead of me doesn't order the Roll as her total equals $9. Makes me question what did she get.   Gentleman behind the register turns, without saying a word, with his back to me I follow his moves thinking he will pick up someone's order to help out. This is a smaller venue with a smaller staff so I understand cooperatively working together.   Anywhoo, he returns face forward and I read the 8.5x11 signs to note \"Lobster Rolls Sold out\" I'm paraphrasing but you can see the picture. Of course, I inquire: \"That's after me? As in after I get my order in then we're out?\" He says, \"Nope. Now\" he posts the sign. I grumble this can't be real. A couple of guys walk in and take note of me taking the picture. They inquire as well and then I turn to leave to which they follow.   GPS now says it'll take me 25 minutes to get home so I've wasted an entire hour for squat? Look folks, I get lunch is served from 11a-2pm. I even understand small business budgets yet if the door opens at 11a and you're out by 12:30p then you never had any real intentions of serving much nor many. This felt every bit of a gimmick. Every bit of sorts because I'm not refuting any popularity matters - I am questioning management in terms of planning and execution.   Just went back to reread the email and it's confirmed - no notice of shortages/sells quickly/et al.   Disappointed is an understatement. At a minimum: more could have been planned for so a larger quantity would have been available today. On the other end of the pendulum swing: acknowledge those of us who are clearly standing in your establishment and make some type of courteous outreach. For example: we will serve them again on this day. Please accept our sincere apology and here's a coupon. IDK but something. I don't live within walking distance and this wasn't along my daily route. This was an intentional trip with True sentiments of excitement and joy (sans mayo, 5 stars, small business with an update via email that the offer would be available the next day) based on my minimal interaction to date.",

Well today was the day, it's Halloween and the hubby and I dropped off our teenager at work and decided to go out for lunch as oppose to heading home to cook. I pulled up my Yelp and looked at my bookmarks and up pops this amazing grace so we headed over.  We arrived at about 1:54pm and lunch is served until 2pm so we ran in and quickly ordered a blacken grouper sandwich and a shrimp platter.  We took a seat at a two top table against the wall and was asked by several people if we wanted another table with more space. I declined serval offers and finally accepted because I was holding a sleeping baby. One of the owners Nancy walked us over to the other table and offered to push two chairs together to lay the baby out while we eat. This was such a nice gesture (mind you we had no idea she was one of the owners as she was just a friendly woman helping us from ordering to moving to serving us food).  The food arrived shortly thereafter and after praying my husband and I dug in. The food was full of flavor and extremely fresh and served at the perfect temperature. We enjoyed EVERYTHING the fries had so much meat in them which is very rare, they are fresh cut and cut thick.   There is so much more on the menu that we want to try so we will definitely be back. Nancy stopped by and spoke with us for a nice amount of time and even cracked a couple of jokes. Before leaving we grabbed a card and that's when we discovered that she and her husband were the owners. I don't throw around 5 stars (check my page) but I definitely give credit where credit is due and this place deserves 5stars",

Think of your favorite takeout/dine in spot you went to growing up. Whether that be a little deli, Chinese food, or Greek food. Now imagine finding that same type of favorite place as an adult; comfortable, extremely casual, fairly priced, and honest. Now add the freshest fish and a variety of options to the equation. I'm in heaven. My boyfriend had the fried flounder sandwich. Heart eye emoji ten times! It was so delectable, and the cilantro lime slaw really set it over the top! I had the ahi tuna tacos with watermelon slaw and crumbled feta cheese. You honestly can't do summer better than that! They also sell fresh fish until 5pm everyday. \"Fresh fish isn't cheap, and cheap fish isn't fresh.\" Words to the wise!",

So I returned today because I had a taste for fried oysters.  Not necessarily their fried oysters, just some fried oysters, and according to Yelp there aren't any other places close to here. They don't serve oysters for lunch!  What?!!  I don't like that.  Comeonguys!  Serve the entire menu for lunch!  If McDonalds can serve breakfast all day y'all can bread some oysters and throw them in the oil during the lunch hours!",

    "text": "Deep Sea Seafood Market, I love you. A whole lot.   This is one of my favorite places in Charlotte. I've never actually bought seafood from here. My affection and obsession are solely based on the amazing lunch menus they crank out every day.  There are some constant items, but the lunch menu changes daily. They post it every day around 10:30am on their website, Facebook, and Twitter. So, make sure to follow them. Lunch is served Monday-Saturday 11am-2pm, Dinner is Tuesday-Saturday 5-8pm.   I've never had a bad meal here. Sandwiches, fish tacos- it's all damn delicious. My absolute favorite is when they do lobster rolls as the special. They are perfection. Warning: if you see it's lobster roll day, go early to make sure you get one before they're all gone. Also, if you go late and they're sold out, don't bitch about it. That's a you problem, not a Deep Sea problem. Seriously, when they post it's lobster roll day, I derail my entire schedule to make sure I can swing by for one.   Seafood counter-wise, the prices seem pretty fare. Remember: you get what you pay for in life. Good, fresh seafood is worth it. You'll always see the same duo working the counter and tables during lunch. They know all the regulars, all the regulars know them. They are great and will put a smile on your face. It's not a huge place. There are a few tables, but your best bet may be to get your food to go during peak lunch time.",

I'm not sure if the man at the register was the owner, but his customer service skills are non existent. You are running a business; providing a service to consumers. The least I expect is to be greeted. There was no greeting and he was annoyed at the questions I asked about the menu. There were also signs up around the restaurant telling the patrons how to conduct themselves while dining there, which I thought was very very weird. I ordered the fried flounder sandwich that came with fries. I never thought that it was possible to mess up a fish sandwich but boy was I wrong. The fish was battered in cornmeal that had absolutely no flavor. The piece of fish was also very small that it was over powered by the hoagie that it was on. I barely tasted the fish. I added salt and pepper to the sandwich in hopes it would give it some flavor but that did not help. The fish literally had no taste and I can tell it was unseasoned. I seriously have made better fish sandwiches at home. The fries were decent because they were homemade and cut in the back. The food tasted and looked like the grease it was cooked in needed to be changed; hence the dark/burnt fries. I honestly didn't finish the food and just took this as a loss. I will stick to going to chicken and ribs on Beatties Ford for my fish sandwiches. Never again will I eat here!",

So as I'm leaving the cook says I hope it makes it home talking about the lasagna and I said of course it will. I had to run some errands and needles to say that final statement was on my mind and had me wondering about the lasagna so on one of my stops I said let me taste it. Well it didn't make it home, that seafood lasagna was phenomenal.  5-11-17 This review is just based off today. The food tasted good and it came out in a reasonable amount of time and the service was great but the sandwich that I received today was unacceptable. They gave me this small piece of fish and made a sandwich out of it. I will post a pic but I was pissed.",

It was everything I'd hoped it would be and more. Overflowing with lobster. Buttery. Warm, soft bread. I could have eaten 10 of them by myself. I didn't even realize I was getting hand cut fries with the roll. They were a completely delicious surprise!   I can't wait to get back and try their other sandwiches.

Called to place an order of mussels, clams, scallops, squid, and snapper (each ~1.5 lb) with a 10 day lead time for pickup. They told me they can not do quantities that small (said they need an order of 10 lbs on mussels and clams). I'm unsure of which consumers they are targeting that purchase 10 pounds of seafood at once, but it is certainly not the typical household. Called another seafood market in Charlotte (over in the Ballantyne area) and they took the order no problem. UPDATE: Despite owners comment- I requested a 1.5lb of clams and mussels. Thanks for the \"actually\" try though :)",

So before I even tasted my food. I can tell you that I came towards the end of the night albeit close to closing I asked if they were still open for business I was told they were my food was prepared in a to go bag. When asked why it was prepared to go a lot of excuses rather than correcting the unwelcoming error. SMH. I was told this is good food but to me it was served on a rusty platter.   #customerservicematters!",

The service was fast and friendly and I love the simple decor efficient includes lots of pictures of people fishing and a shelf full of records (nostalgia set in quickly).   We were there for lunch and there's a separate menu from dinner. The lobster roll war served with thick cut fries but not many were in the order and they were a bit underdone and lacking seasoning (zero salt was added).   But the lobster roll. The roll was AMAZING!!  It wasn't minced pieces of meat, it was full chunks of lobster. There was so much butter on the bread that it was running out (what's better with lobster than butter??!!). So. Good.   The hubs enjoyed the fish and chips (with the exception of the fries).  The fish we seasoned and fried well. It wasn't a large serving but it was satisfying.   The fresh seafood in the display case looked great and if we were locals we'd definitely shop there regularly.",

First of all the waiter was very unfriendly to the point where that alone was about to be enough to have us leave. Then I saw him handle raw fish without gloves and that's where I drew the line. I'm very sad to see an establishment like this draw a negative experience from seafood lovers like us, but it's True.   Lastly, they have a lot of condescendingly rude comments posted all over the store that are meant to be direction about how they would like you to act while dining there, but if you cannot even follow basic food safety protocol and look people in the eye...keep your snide comments to yourself.",

Their selection of fresh fish is amazing and varied and very fresh. Their lunch menu changes every day based on what's available, but some things you can find most days (shrimp po boy, fish and chips etc...). I had the fish and chips today and it was some of the best I've ever had. I've spent a lot of time in Alaska, and I grew up in the Pacific Northwest so my seafood standards are pretty high and Deep Sea exceeded all expectations. We also tried the alligator sausage po boy and it was incredible as well. This is now a regular spot for us, both for lunch and where we buy our seafood. Bonus: they can order pretty much anything you could want, so this is a great place to use if you are trying something new or special.  Also: the employees here are TOP NOTCH. They are knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. While we were eating lunch, an employee noticed another customer had left their purse and he ran out to her car to make sure she didn't leave it. They also know several of their customers by name which speaks to their kindness and to the fact that so many people come here regularly.",

Located in a neighborhood outside the hub of busy Charlotte, It looks like nothing from the street. Inside a big seafood case takes up half the width of the room. 10 wooden tables and chairs take up most of the remaining space. Don't judge a book by its cover! If you like seafood, this is just the place for you! Although it was a small menu, we found some of our favorites to choose from. My husband enjoyed a fried shrimp and oyster platter fried just right while I had a creamy clam chowder and shrimp cocktail. The soup, if you like spicy, had a little kick to it. The shrimp were prepared perfectly. The orders came out very quickly. The service was great! If we lived in the area we would certainly return.",

I had the lobster roll with potato wedges and my hubs had the Scottish Salmon dinner with zucchini & potatoes.  My lobster roll was every bite delicious. Filled with lobster and lightly buttered on a toasted roll it was yummy!  The hubs salmon was huge ! It was grilled to perfection and had a light ginger sauce with scallions.  The zucchini and potatoes were delicious!  I've read the reviews and waited for this day and it was definitely worth it!   I did have a bit of anxiety when I read the sign posted on the wall that stated any party of 2 sitting at a table of 4 could be asked to move.  Kinda made me feel like the soup nazi ... we decided not to press our luck and sat at the smaller table.  A delicious dinner that was everything I hoped it would be.  Definitely will come back .... hopefully on Lobster roll day !",

We had 5 people in our party and the Market was very accommodating but the food didn't hit the mark. Two Shrimp Po Boy's were both over cooked with coating crackling off the shrimp. I had Fish and Chips, fries were burnt, dry and tasteless. The coating was not in proportion to the cod - hardly any fish in there as I was served 4 chunks of cod instead of a nice filet where I could actually taste the fish. My wife had Shrimp tacos w/ mango salsa. Usually a good combo, but not tonight. More mush than flavor. The last dish was corn chowder with Andouille sausage - I fear the best flavor of the night - weird - no seafood in there!  Disappointed overall!!",

If you see the email alert for lunch and you drive 30 minutes out of your way to go get some lobster! Yeah, I'd say that qualifies.  Late lunch, the staff already knew what I wanted when I walked in the door. I've been asking about 'em for months now. I was a bit afraid that everyone else's rave reviews of these rolls were hyping them up too much. My order arrived at the table and I was in awe. Just look at my picture and you'll get the gist. Connecticut Style Lobster served with butter, lemon, and herbs, that's it!  Was it worth it? After two past failures at other places that supposedly specializes in lobster Rolls, this one was the read deal. A generous amount of lobster in every bite, herbs and lemon was just enough to amp the lobster flavor, toasted bun. It was just, blissful! No more words, just go and get one!  Come in and sign up for their email alerts to know what the lunch specials will be daily. You won't leave disappointed!",

Sadly the rolls are not on the menu daily (not today) but I love that the menu rotates so there is always something new to try.  I opted for the salmon burger (suggested by the friendly fella behind the register).  Best. Salmon. Burger. of my life!!  Perfectly grilled and had a lovely wasabi aioli (not overpowering).  The accompanying steak fries were delish as well.  If I could give this place 10 stars I would.  I will definitely be back next Friday to try the coveted lobster rolls!!  :)",

I placed a takeout order and got there just before they closed to pick it up... the shrimp po boy was my choice because I've never been let down by that dish.  I paid for my order then left, wanting to tip them with any extra money I had, the setup was nice in the place: the counter was wide and open, and the kitchen window was to the left (if you are facing the counter), which reminded me of a drive thru. Hahaha pretty funny, I have plenty of jokes. Actually that one wasn't my best but you get the point.  When I left, I opened up the package and got a beautiful shrimp po boy with some sauce drizzled inside, along with lettuce and fries. Every bite I took sent me on a Flavertown vacation, street cred to Guy Fieri. I will DEFINITELY be back here, I just love this place. It was reasonably priced too, about $11, so I feel it was a good meal and was worth the money.",

Thankfully the guy that was the server was incredibly nice. If it wasn't for him I'm not sure I'd ever go back. Having good food is nice but good food isn't worth being treated badly as a customer.

Or get your lunch order to go.   I had the halibut fish tacos which were nicely spiced and flavorful.  The tacos came with big, fat fries. And I ordered unsweet tea.

Meaty crab cakes,  little to no filler or binder, with  tasty homemade remulade and cocktail sauce.  The smashed potatoes were a surprise hit.  Didn't expect much but wow!  Buttery, sour creamy, tasty!  And I liked the sweet and spicy kick from the peach salsa.  That meal was so good I encouraged my coworker- friend from to eat here for lunch.  He had the Mahi Reuben sandwich and a side of slaw.  He loved the sandwich.  I tried the slaw and it was bright, lightly creamy and crunchy - so good! There's some lime or something in there that really separates it from your typical Cole slaw.  And I had the seared Ahi tuna with Applewood bacon and spicy slaw on a chibatta bun.  Wow!!  If you like seared FRESH Ahi as an appetizer, you won't believe what a great it is to have it for lunch.  I also enjoyed the corn chowder and jalapeno cornbread. The soup was just the right amount of creamy to meaty ratio.  The cornbread was fresh and moist with crispy edges the way you'd expect from a place that seems to do everything with a high level of attention to detail, balance of flavors and perfect execution. I wanted to try everything I could because I leave Charlotte tomorrow.   I'll be back!!  Thanks guys!!",

I usually find tilapia mealy and gross, but we bought some from Deep Sea to make our little girl some homemade fish sticks (she likes to help), and it was firm, flaky and delicious. I tested it several times against Harris Teeter since and it is seriously just better. ...then we tried the food. Now we eat here regularly and usually take home some bacon-wrapped jalapenos or crab cakes. The soups they make are CRAZY good, you can buy those to go too. The grouper sandwich is usually on the menu, which changes with what's available, and it is my favorite. Everything we have ever tried at Deep Sea is done very well or better.

I would probably never notice this place if I were to drive by it on a normal day being that it is in a small strip mall. The place is pretty simple but I don't mind the ambience as long as the food is good. The menu is not the same as the lunch menu and they have rotating specials so I highly suggest you call the restaurant before visiting. I kept asking for lunch items I saw on Yelp and they were not available for dinner. Bummer but I was ok with it. The menu is not overly complicated where you cannot choose what to eat but there is plenty of options. I had the pan seared tuna sandwich with fries. The sandwich was amazing, a little spicy due to the slaw that comes on the sandwich but still enjoyable. The portion was more than enough for me. I wish this place was closer to my job so that I can try the lunch menu but I will be back.",

Don't know if I want to give it another shot by trying something else. The pictures I've seen posted look good. Maybe they have improved since we went. Otherwise might be worth buying some fresh and cooking yourself at home. Fish and chips a definite no.",

They truly have the freshest selection - yes the prices are higher than HT, but this is FRESH seafood. On my last visit I picked up some wild caught gulf jumbo shrimp - they were ginormous! Nothing like what you find at the grocery store.   I've heard great things about their clam bakes/lobster dinners - I have to check one out soon!",

The steak fries are just ok as they are never fully cooked on the inside but this place is worth it. Everything is made to order and as you order and seating is limited so get there early to be beat the rush..",

Tucked away in a nondescript shopping strip in Matthews right past the Food Lion on Monroe Road is this fantastic seafood shoppe and lunch/dinner establishment. Not only can you buy from a wonderful and varied selection of the freshest seafood for your own grilling and cooking needs, but also stop in and just nosh for lunch and dinner when you don't feel like cooking and still eat some of the best seafood dishes in town. Of note are the wonderful lobster rolls (if there are any left), fresh seafood salads, smoked salmon BLT, mahi reuben and a host of other seafood offerings that are rotated in and out of the daily menu. They have started offering dinner as well so anyone in the area should for sure give them a chance. They are family owned and operated and always offer the best quality!",

So I ordered the fried flounder sandwich.  Friendly, courteous staff. Prompt service. Everything was fresh and tasty. But the main ingredient was almost missing. Sandwich was about 90% bread with a very tiny sliver of flounder in it. Unimpressed.  If you want a fried flounder sandwich, I recommend Showmars.",
