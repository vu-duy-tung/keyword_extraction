The lady at the to-go station was very friendly and the restaurant offered free peach tea while we waited for our order, so that was very nice.  However, they messed up my food order, which we only discovered after leaving the restaurant and arriving home. :(  It was very disappointing.  Next time, I will check my order before leaving.",

    "text": "So so disappointed. Took my extended family, and my Dad there last night. We had just had my mothers funeral, and wanted to celebrate her memory by going to one of her favorite restaurants, Olive Garden. We had a party of 13, and were told it would be a 30 minute wait. It took them over an hour to seat us. When we finally were seated it took the servers 15 minutes before coming to the table. We ordered wine. They brought out the water, and other drinks, then the one server brought wine bottles, but no wine glasses. We had to flag another server who told us that the restaurant was currently out of wine glasses, and had to wait until a load went through the washer. The salads were delivered to our table with no salad bowls, and when those who had soup were served some had no spoons. The period between the salad and main course was too long. When our main courses arrived two weren't served, and my wife was told her order had been given away! This was overall just a bad experience. I'm in the process of contacting their corporate offices, because the service at this particular Olive Garden was way, way below the standards that made It one of my Mom's favorite restaurants.",

Yes, Im writing this on my way home because Im so irked. Ordered two entrees and a bottle of wine to go and left a decent tip for just a take out order.  I got a drink at the bar and got involved in the tv program.  Someone sat next to me about 30 minutes into my wait and got their meal in 10 minutes.  I looked around and the managers were on their cell phones. Finally, I went to the counter and asked why my buzzer hadn't gone off. The girl said my order was almost ready.... and then took it out of a warming oven!! I placed my order at 5:59 pm and left there with (an incorrect) order at 6:45pm. Wtf. Never getting take out again.",

I also do not prefer high carb dishes, so she worked with Chef John to get the trout to come with white sauce (Alfredo) with soft steamed broccoli, they tasted heavenly and will order again.  Manager also came visited me for comments.  I appreciate the good work this location has offered me, from the greeter, to my waitress to the food, to the chef and the manager.  I will also recommend this location to others since customer services combined with good food trumps other criteria in my book.  :)",

And each time I've been greeted by at LEAST three people with the biggest smiles on their faces. They have had my order ready exactly when I requested it each time and they always make sure I don't need anything else. Not to mention they package my meal appropriately! How many times have you ordered to go soup from a restaurant and the lid wasn't sealed or the bowl was upside down? Not here! They even put in these nifty divider things between items. I love it! Dining in- Have you ever worked in retail with a manager who just sat a computer all day, not facing any of the crab burst customers? Every time I've come to this location, I've seen the managers help carry meals to tables, bring refills, check on guests, and even clean tables. What a breath of fresh air! The waiters are all smiles, super fast, and give you updates on your meal before it comes out. Once I ordered a piece of the limoncello cake to go and the waiter accidentally brought it on a plate (not a big deal of course, let's be real, once I saw it I wanted to dig right in!) so instead of bringing me a box, he brought me a brand new piece to go right away, at no charge! What?! These guys get it right. Now, I'm gonna go eat my delicious fresh salad and some of those famous breadsticks.",

If you walked in here right now you'd probably turn right back around and walk out. The bar is the first thing you see and it's filthy with half full drinks and dirty dishes that have sat here for literally the last hour and a half....yes it took an hour and a half for wine and spaghetti!

We also shared an app. of calamari, stuffed mushrooms and  mozzarella sticks. We both had shrimp alfredo. It was pretty good.  No complaints about the food.  But the timing of the food was a little off. Our apps and main course came out basically together. At least we got them in a timely manner. Thats why the 4 stars instead of 5.

The only good part about this experience is the drinks. The drinks we had to wait 10-15 minutes for it, but it was good. Everything else was bad.",

Our perception of OG from the past wasn't very positive at all, but it had been many years since we had visited. I finally convinced Alina to try it, and I'm happy she agreed. I don't like Italian food for 2 reasons: I don't eat red sauce, and I don't eat pasta. I do however like their salads, so I usually order that. Alina order the fettuccine alfredo, with the all you can eat soup and breadsticks. They have these cool boxes on the table where you can order your own apps and desserts, we used it to order the Spicy Shrimp Scampi Fritta. It was delivered quickly, along with breadsticks. I wasn't a fan of the shrimp, the sauce a little salty for my taste, but Alina must have enjoyed it because she sopped it all up with her breadsticks. My salad was good as usual, the lettuce was especially crunchy. That's a good thing. Alina really loved her pasta. Kind of made me a hero for bringing her. We skipped dessert, and when I asked for an order of breadsticks to go, the waiter (who was very new btw) left and came right back with an order in a 2go bag.   Lunch was great, mainly because my Wife enjoyed hers so much. Thanks Olive Garden for scoring some brownie points for me, I can usually use them.",

Both of us like a lot of sauce on our meal, whether it's alfredo, regular meat sauce, etc.  When we've asked for extra sauce in the past, it's never been an issue.  The sauce is always brought in a tiny container, I suspect it hold a good 4-5 table spoons full, but if it's not enough, we just ask for more.  The last time we were there, we were told by our server that we could only have one little extra container, and after that, we would have to order extra sauce as an appetizer and pay for it.  I asked the server when they started that policy, and she told me it's always been in effect.  She said any extra sauce she gives us has to be approved by the manager, but she would see what she could do.  I've been eating at this Olive Garden for years, and this policy is new to me.  The pasta isn't the same if you can't have enough sauce and then you have to pay for more.  Needless to say, we left unhappy.",

Service throughout the meal was very good so no complaints on that score.  I order Steak Toscano (Medium Rare) while my wife had the Stuffed Chicken Marsala. Of course we both had the prefunctory salad which was pretty god but still heavy on lettuce and very light on other ingredients.  While my wife liked her Chicken, my steak was anyting but medium rare. More like medium done and not a good cut of meat . Very tough, fiberous and dry which is the reason I like medium rare.  We've eated at this particular location on multiple occassions and generally have been very pleased but with the repeated changes in the menu, makes it a little less appealing as a dining option.",

Our order was given and still no salad or bread sticks. How long before we got them our food cane out first. They took the food back and brought the salad and the wife had ordered soup which came as well. As the wife ate her soup, very good, she wondered if they would just bring out the same plates they took back to the kitchen.  We finished and after a short wait the main courses appeared again. I had a shrimp and chicken on pasta which was at serving temp and tasted very good. But, the wife's shrimp scampi was stone cold. Needless to say she was upset but wouldn't let me send it back which is what should have happened.  She did not feel well and that is why we stopped for dinner rather than cook when we got home. At this point we just asked for boxes and left. There have been other problems at this location and we have stopped going there for awhile in the past   Haven't decided just what we are going to do this time.",

    "text": "I love the Olive Garden and I've been a fan for over twenty years now. I will say that my experience at the Northlake location last night was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant, and I wish I was exaggerating.   The night started off with the waiter telling my parents (who got there before my twin sister and I did) after they asked that the breadstick chicken parmesan sandwich was available at dinner time. The only difference would be that the sandwich would be $10.99 instead of $6.99. I made sure to order it when I heard it was available!  After my family ordered, the waiter came back twice to ask questions about my parents'  orders and still didn't seem clear about what they wanted from the \"2 for 25\" Tuscan dinner items. He never wrote anything down, which was alarming and I believe added to his confusion.  The waiter brought us breadsticks with DIRTY PLATES. When we asked for more plates, he brought us salad with DIRTY BOWLS. What was going on in that kitchen?! My dad is a restaurant owner and we do understand how things happen so we thought it was a one off situation the first time, but multiple dirty plates is inexcusable.  Then the waiter came back and said he was wrong, the breadstick chicken parm sandwich was NOT available at dinner and I'd have to order something else. I asked why he had told us it was after we asked earlier and he said another coworker told him the wrong thing. I thought it was ridiculous they couldn't just make it since it's not like they don't have the ingredients, so I got up and found the manager.  I told the manager I was unhappy and asked why the sandwich was unavailable and he said it is, they just have to clear it with me since it's not on the dinner menu.  Olive Garden clearly needs to work on their communication issue about the breadstick sandwiches if the employees don't know what's going on and this has been a huge promotion for them.  We were hoping the sandwich issue would be the last issue, but it was just the beginning of a downward spiral. My dad asked for a beer FIVE TIMES and the waiter didn't bring it - not a refill, but the beer he ordered when he sat down!  He finally got it after all of those requests. We never got salad or bread at the same time  - it was always one or the other, despite our repeated requests for both.  The table behind us had two kids who were screaming most of the meal. I know that is not on Olive Garden, but it definitely put us on the edge and we didn't ask to move since we knew we'd probably already been written off by the staff as \"that table\" and we didn't want to make our waiter even more confused.  When our entrees came, it got even worse. Both of my parents' entrees looked disgusting. My mom's pasta looked like it was half cooked and my dad's pasta barely had any sauce on it. They told the waiter that the food wasn't good and he did switch them out for two other entrees.  At the end of the meal, we were all just completely fed up and we asked to talk to the manager about the experience. He seemed patronizing and kept trying to minimize our feedback. At that point, we were just ready to go. We got our bill and it had an extra charge for an antipasti salad that no one ordered. We told the waiter about that (and also gave him our 20% off coupon) and when he came back, he told us the manager decided to comp the entrees and we only paid for two soft drinks and a beer. We did still leave a 25% tip based on the original total because we knew it wasn't fair for us to only spend $13.  We didn't expect the meals to be comped, but we were grateful and appreciative. However, the manager ruined his act of goodwill when as we were walking out, we saw him and my dad thanked him, but also said he didn't have to comp all of the entrees and the manager said it was no problem.  After we walked by him and I sat in the lobby waiting for my family members at the end of the night, I witnessed him talking loudly and mocking my family to another employee. I glared at him until he felt the gaze, and he came over to me and tried to laugh it off, but the damage was done. That was unprofessional and should never happen! I was polite since I didn't want to cause a scene and we all just wanted to leave, but are you kidding me?! What a way to add disgusting icing to an already inedible cake!  I'm giving 2 stars because we've had good experiences at this location in the past. I'd give -10 stars based on last night.",

We went for an early Friday night dinner, noticed the parking lot was pretty empty due to the time, but as we were greeted by the hostess, we were told there was a wait!  WTH?? Did no one come to work this evening?  After waiting for about 10 minutes, we were ushered to the tiniest booth I have ever seen. We asked to move to a bigger booth and we were promptly moved across the room. On my side of the booth, the gentleman, I use the term very loosely, had his arm draped over over the back of the booth and into my seat. I started to move towards the seat, he moved his arm long enough for me to sit down, then moved his whole arm back into my side of the booth. Where do these customers grow up, in a barn??  After it was obvious the person behind me would not remove his arm from my side of the booth, we asked to move.  The waiter looked around dumbfounded, and could not find a single empty table ( there were about 5 in our vicinity) to move us to. Needless to say, we got up and left absolutely disgusted!!!  The customers are dirty, the restaurant is filthy and we could not bare to eat anything at this location!  DON'T EVER come here expecting a decent meal, nice atmosphere, or a good dining experience!!!!",

That could be either because I don't rank Italian as one of my favorite food categories, or because Olive Garden itself just doesn't appeal to me. This one is getting my review solely because it's closest to home and where I go anytime I'm invited by one of the several people I know that love it.  Now, I've been here several times. Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad it's just average. On my most recent trip I ordered the mussels app as my meal and planned to dip the endless breadsticks in the broth. They were made well and I'm sure exactly as they were meant but I just didn't like them. The tomato-based broth was too acidic for me. Their pastas are good enough - it's hard to get pasta wrong I think, especially when it's what you're known for. The seafood based dishes are never up to my standards. I'd prefer to get my seafood elsewhere. And, last but certainly not least, the dislike that will get me killed by any Olive Garden fan: I don't like the breadsticks. Nope, not in the least. They're warm and that's about it. They're too salty and too soft without that extra \"crunch\" along the outside crust. I seriously think they could improve them with a crispier crust. All of my friends may now commence beating me up! haha  For service here I've never been disappointed. They really go the extra mile to make sure you enjoy yourself and feel as if you're having a classy Italian restaurant experience. The banter with the waitstaff is always friendly and you're made to feel welcome here. Now if only they can get their flavors down to match the service quality I think they could rank up with my favorite Italian place: Macaroni Grill.",

He immediately approach the table with two bottles of wine and gave us samples of each to see if we would like to start our dinner with it. He was 100% attentive to the table and got our orders.

Our visit happened to be during their Never Ending Pasta Special, which I believe happens every winter and fall. I ordered fettuccine with Asiago Garlic Alfredo with crispy chicken fritta. It was delicious! I ordered it again for my second plate, which promptly went in a to go box. Normally I order the Chicken Scampi, which is an angel based pasta with a white wine sauce. This was not offered as 'never ending'.   While the pasta is good, what makes this restaurant stand out is the unlimited salad and breadsticks. I am obsessed with the salad dressing. We always order extra salad dressing on the side (free of charge!) because the salad tends to come with just a little dressing. We also dip the breadsticks in the dressing! So good.   I deducted one star because service here is hit or miss. Our waiter this visit, Rich, was fantastic. Other times the service hasn't been great. I always find myself coming back for more salad and breadsticks though!  Note: This time I didn't order a drink, but their frozen strawberry mango margarita is amazing.",

I've eaten here before, no complaints. It's definitely not my forte, but she was in the mood for breadsticks so the decision was made.   My shrimp Alfredo, accompanying soup (the one with dumplings and chicken) tasted fine. My friend was very disappointed with her chicken Parmesan. It was tough and very crispy. She loves chicken parm, and is not a nit picky person, so if she complains there is a problem. The appetizer duo of calamari and fried mozzarella had only 3 small triangle slices of mozzarella.  To add insult to injury, the breadsticks she was dreaming about all week were hard on the ends and bottom. There was 1.5 breadsticks left on the table. That's a FIRST. She didn't even want to take any home.  The service was fine, everyone was friendly. I only wished I had chosen to deal with rush hour traffic and gone to eat at Cowfish like I had wanted. It won't happen again. Enjoy the $60, OG- it's the last you'll get from me.",

My office is mere minutes away from this location so if a pasta craving hits, I can be in and out thanks to placing my order online. The people who are behind the desk handling the to-go orders have been above and beyond friendly and always make sure everything is correct.  As for the food? Eh, it's an Olive Garden but I go here for their pasta e fagioli soup and breadsticks so not much can be messed with up my order.   My personal tip: place your to-go order online via their website and check online for coupon codes...I saved 15% on my last to-go order!",

My brother ordered a pesto dish and the bottom was covered in tablespoons of pure oil. Disgusting. And his noodles were hard as if they weren't fresh. Neither of us ate but a few bites and filled up on breadsticks. My daughters Alfredo sauce tasted off and her chicken was dry.",

The first part of our meal was ok, the waitress was attentive and came right back when we placed an order. After our appetizer, there was a major delay in receiving our entrees. Our waitress got busy and didn't come back to check on us for about 30 minutes. Once the food came out (Shrimp alfredo/ never ending chicken alfredo) the food was hot, but  he noodles was over cooked and it tasted horrible!! I asked for a lasagna instead and this is what they brought me in the picture below. I requested to take it with me. I'm not sure what happened tonight but this is unacceptable. If one dish is horrible and I ask for a replacement, please give the actual entree that's advertised. The manager walked by several times and NEVER stopped to talk with us although she spoke with several patrons around us. I paid $68 for our meal and I could have had a Wendy's fish sandwich for $7 and enjoyed it more!! Just horrible experience! Do better Olive Garden....",

I could just eat the salad and fill up on that but LOVE LOVE their Zuppa Toscana Soup - with the hearty kale, Italian sausage and lil kick with the red pepper.    We sat in the bar area due to lack of seating in the dining room so the noise level was a bit more distracting but it was worth it given the wait for well past an hour for dining room seating.    You can order from the full menu in the bar area so why not.  It was girls night out and we had fun.  Thank Olive Garden.  :)",

My order was accurate and I received a few extra breadsticks because my order wasn't ready until five minutes after the promised time, an inconvenience I didn't even notice until it was mentioned to me.  The bad about this visit was the food.  The pastas were over cooked and mushy.  Not to mention, the pasta wasn't even drained properly.  There was starchy-looking water at the bottom of the to go container.  There wasn't enough sauce on the pastas.  The four cheese marinara was flavorful and had chunks of tomato.  On the other hand, the Alfredo sauce wasn't flavorful.  It was very thin and appeared to have separated into oil and some other strange liquid.  The breadsticks were garlicky and reheated well.  The chicken and gnocchi soup was fantastic and made good leftovers for the next day.  I expected more as far as food quality and am reluctant to return until time has passed or I hear improvements have been made.",

    "text": "All I can say is WOW! My first job was actually at an Olive Garden in Ohio, so I'm familiar with at least the atmosphere but...this experience was AMAZING! First off, they were busy and we were told the wait would be 15 minutes, we only waited for about 6 minutes. We were taken to a table however, we requested a booth in a different section, we were informed the waitress for that section had just sat a party and it would be a minute but our drink orders would be taken. Turns out, we were being taken care of by the manager Ms. Nikea while we awaited our waitress. This was especially significant to me as it showed that Ms. Nikea even at her position didn't mind filling in where she was needed regardless of what it was. That type of leadership is contagious and shows why this experience from top to bottom was phenomenal. Our waitress Milan was nothing short of amazing when she became available which was a lot sooner than expected. Milan displayed incredible attentiveness to our needs and was exceptionally knowledgeable of the restaurant and the menu. I was even pleased with the pricing for all the food we enjoyed. We paid about $39 for a Watermelon Margarita $5, 1 Zoodles Primavera with a salad $14.49, 1 Chicken & Shrimp Carbonara and a Zuppa Toscana $18.99 plus breadsticks and Alfredo sauce. Though the breadsticks, soup and salad were complimentary with the purchase of the meals it was the amount of food we received all together for the price that stood out. Not to mention the soup and salad were unlimited! After we got our soup and salad our food was ready rather quickly and might I add was exquisite. This was a remarkable experience in its totality. I truly appreciate the culture of this Olive Garden and am very grateful for Ms. Nikea and Milan for making this visit what it was. I will definitely recommend this location to everyone!",

Upon walking in the wait was estimated at 15 minutes and we were sat in 8 minutes on a Friday evening. The manager of the restaurant Nikea was a great conversationalist. You could tell she had been in the business for awhile and her employees loved her! I had a watermelon margarita and it looked and tasted just as good as the picture. I tried the new zoodles meal with mushrooms instead of chicken (and they didn't charge me extra which was really cool). I had a salad with the infamous Italian dressing . Between the salad, bread and margarita by the time I got my main dish I couldn't eat it . I did try it and it was seasoned to perfection. Really enjoyed my experience and they did not have us wait long for our food which was a super huge plus because I was HANGRY!",

At min 12 another table was sat directly across from us and was greeted before everyone was in there seats. After seeing this my wife and I just decided to walk out.

Our waiter was kind of slow and seemed like he was a new because every time we asked him a question he either hesitated and sounded like he was not confident in his answer. When I ordered my food he asked me if I wanted a soup or salad. I said salad so I assumed that I would be getting my own salad aside from the one that comes to the whole table. I asked him about it and he said since you want to salad you get the salad that comes with the table. I said that doesn't make sense, you might as well just give me soup then if I was already going to get the salad that comes with the table. That still does not make sense to me I would not very impressed with my food as I am already not a fan of Olive Garden, I probably won't go back again.",

So finally the hubs agreed to try out this location {he's not a pasta fan, but likes it's okay enough to take me lol} So the waiter was very nice. Informed me after we ordered ours drinks that they were out of strawberries for the mango strawberry tea. That's fine, I got the peach raspberry tea instead {pretty tasty}. Waited for a good while before offered salad & breadsticks. No problem... Then our food came out, but before our appetizer. Kinda odd. We both got the shrimp & chicken carbonara. I never have to add salt or pepper to much of anything, but this was kinda bland. The only thing I really enjoyed was the stuffed mushrooms. Did I get my pasta fix? Sure.  Will I go back? Probably not. Good waiter minus the appetizer problem. 3 stars",

For the quality and proportion of food, you can't beat the modest prices, gift cards offered, and great deals. Sure, I have moments where I might crave a Carrabas or Macaroni Grill but I feel that my money could be better spent supporting a local Italian joint with authentic food if I'm going that route.  I feel that Olive Garden is well balanced between quality and cost, but again, there is always that chain business component as well. Let me throw an analogy your way. Olive Garden is like Tex-Mex for Italian food, or better yet, like the Jersey Shore cast to Italians.   Overall, I myself take advantage of those great deals and free gift cards. When I do, I always enjoy my meal. Especially at this location. Great food, great atmosphere, great service, & a great staff.",

The tile flooring had obviousely been washed in the ladies room and front lobby as there were still tell tale signs of water on the floor in places.  My best guess is they used old nasty water/mops to wash the tile without any sanitzer..  If the odor had permeated the dining area I would have left the restaurant.

My daughter and I happened to be in the neighborhood that day so we decided to drop in for lunch.  Our server (Dreama) was excellent. If my review was based only on her service, I would give this review fours stars.  The woman who greeted us at the front wasn't unpleasant but she greeted us as if she wasn't sure why we were there. Which I found odd, to say the least.  We were seated immediately. In no time, our server appeared to take our drink and appetizer order.   My daughter wanted to try the fried calamari so we did. Along with the salad and bread sticks, it really could have been a meal by itself.  For our main course, my daughter ordered the \"make your own\" pizza and I made a special order of grilled chicken and pasta with no sauce and a side of the Olive Garden's tasty salad dressing.  A different server brought our food. My daughter's pizza was perfect. Although my plate was very hot, my pasta was cold. When Dreama came back, I told her about my pasta and she immediately whisked my plate away and had a replacement out to me very soon.   Dreama was a great server. Her banter was witty, she checked on us at the perfect intervals, and our drinks were refilled just when they needed to be.  We had enough to eat and enough leftovers to take home.  Although I love Italian food and we used to dine at the Olive Garden a few times a month, I can no longer eat alfredo sauce and I have to limit my tomato intake.  Sadly, this removes Olive Garden from our list of favorite restaurants. But for every now and again, this location is our preferred Olive Garden and Dreama is definitely our preferred server.",

The issue was when we were seated it took awhile for our server to arrive and he seemed a little scatterbrained. He may have been new, I'm not sure. Some time passed before we received the salad and breadsticks and the salad was drenched with dressing which made it soggy. We ordered our food, which was ok. My fiance wasn't impressed with his meal and ended up getting something else. When his food arrived, he had to wait 5 minutes before receiving replacement silverware and our drinks were not refilled the entire time(it wasn't that busy in there either). The server also said he was going to remove the other dish from the bill, but it still showed up when we got the check. Another 5 minutes passed before we saw the server again with the correct bill. He was a nice guy, but it just didn't seem like he was paying attention.",

The only reason I ever go to Olive Garden is soup and salad for lunch. They have a pretty decent chicken caesar and I really like the pasta fagioli. The breadsticks are their claim to fame and they are certainly addicting. Everything else on the menu bears little resemblence to anything that ever came out of any kitchens inhabited by my relatives (aand we are not that far removed from Sicily) and I never saw anything so cheese smothered and cream laden during my travels in Italy. I also get annoyed by the names they randomly make up for their faux Italian dishes. Rollini. Seriously? Aside from the cheesey atmosphere, the service is usually pretty good but one section of the dining room butts up to a kitchen wall and you keep getting slammed everytime the dishwasher on the other side is opened/closed...it's loud and jarring, not fun.",

After speaking to management and learning they weren't actually setting up our table, 11 of us left. Before we left management was fully aware of us knowing their v review was already bad and we were about to kill their ratings. My group that left has gone to Red Robin, already seated, and drinks and appetizers already ordered. Thankfully the manager is personally seating the remaining of he 14 in our family. Thank you cousin for trying to do this for the family. You definitely didn't have control of this. This was one of the worst customer services I've had in a very long time. I drank two glasses of wine. My grandson needed water and my sick mom needed bread and water while waiting. I would not recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy. The management was aware I and my family is about to leave a bad review.",

You might hate your job but at least pretend in front of customers dude. Not my most enjoyable visit to this one.",

    "text": "Honestly disapointed the last time we came here. 2 of us went last week for dinner. To start out we just stood at the host stand with the host while he was trying to get someone to seat us (there were people behind him). You could tell they just didnt want to. Finally the same person that was behind the host finally decided they would seat us. I get it. we came in late. But not great first impression.   The place was really bright. Not sure why. It seemed like they just got done being busy because a ton of tables were dirty and not reset. Our booth was wiped but there were a ton of crumbs on the booth seats.   We got seated and the waiter did a great job of getting to us and taking care of the table especially because i saw the host triple sat him all at once.   We ordered wine and both of our glasses had something floating in the wine(maybe cork)  The food was awful. I had the new pork tips which were very fatty and extremely small portioned for $15. It came with ravioli and there were only like 5 on the plate and the pasta seemed dried out. The presentation looked like they just slopped it on the plate. I finished it only because i was starving and i dont like to complain and send things back  The other person had lasagne that seemed like was just microwaved and put in a bowl and brought to the table. The pasta was extremely dried out and barely cut apart with a knife. She ate about a quarter of it and just stopped.   The only good thing about our experience was the server did a great job. Other than that it would only be one star. No one besides him just really seemed to care from appearance to quality of food.   I try not to be a bad reviewer but it was just bad all around. Very disapointed from a place i used to love going to .",

I want to like this Olive Garden because we've received quite a few gift cards to the chain, but the food was bland and below average and the \"endless\" salad looked and tasted like it was old and slightly browning. With so many other great options at this price point in the Charlotte area, we will not bother coming back for round three.",

The rest is pretty-much crap. They don't even make their meat balls in store. I only go there because my wife doesn't m ind eating frozen food.",

    "text": "I totally agree with Chad. Almost all the so-called authentic restaurants are Americanized to cater most people's taste bugs here.  I went to Italy & saw their Italian cooking.  I tried to go there last night (Satursday evening) as invited by my neighbor who has never been there. I told him its nice to go at least once to experience instead of just listening. Beside, their food is not bad though commercial. What do we expect when they are so busy.  On the way, I asked if he's reserved. He said no. So I called. The lady said, \" we don't reserve except a party of eight. We only do first come, first serve.\" \" thanks!\" We arrived at around 6:00 pm, there were always tons of waiters (I mean waiting customers) both waiting inside & outside the restaurants, even it was around OMG 30 degrees.  I walked up to ask how long I've to wait. She said, at least 50 minutes for party of two.  I turned around to ask my friend, even it is a Food Bank, I couldn't wait as we were starving.  I saw there are many restaurants around, perhaps we could find somewhere. So they lose our business.  Want to respond to some of the reviews.  It looks like this place was acceptable years ago.  Recently, none good comments.  They're still packed by their marketing skill, no reservation, just wait.... Besides, not everyone will research over the yelp to see reviews like shopping for a merchandise.",

(unlimited soup,salad and breadsticks and half panini with soup)  Not an overly complicated order, or so we thought.  We didn't get our breadsticks til the meal was practically done and we only got one refill on our drinks.  The manager picked up our bill which was just as good as I wouldn't have paid for it anyway.",
