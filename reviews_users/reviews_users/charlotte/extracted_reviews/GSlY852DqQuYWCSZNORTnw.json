Topping were good quality. Negative:  we ordered meatball on half as a topping and there wasn't nearly enough on the pizza, a couple of slices in just that half had none.  The price on the ad board for a supreme pizza in the restaurant was less than what I paid for 2 and a half toppings.  I dislike restaurants that have an inconsistent pricing scheme or require that you ask for a price in order to get it and then you see the advertisement when you walk in.",

I has to clean the high chair before putting my child in it, it literally had pizza and food caked in the seat. I even tried to swap it out.. The other seat was even worse! I ordered pasta for myself and a pizza for my kids. The wait wasn't too long, however the kitchen carried on a conversation that involved profanity. Which my children could overhear in the empty restaurants. There was a girl wrapping brownies that kept licking her fingers. My food came out with the wrong sauce and cold broccoli on the pasta. There wasn't a genuine concern over the mistake. I sucked it up and just asked for a side of the suave I ordered and she said it would take about ten minutes to melt the cheese. TEN MINUTES? Are you using a candle to melt it? I finally had enough when I heard \"Holy S!*%\" come loudly and clearly from the kitchen. The manager \"Chris\" listened to me. He said I'm sorry. But that was it. I told him in no uncertain terms that I would not be back. He walked back in to the kitchen. The end.  There are simply too many other places that are Clean and efficient for me to waste another dime here.",

    "text": "Three coworkers and I had our \"Friday Fun Lunch\" here yesterday, and we were all very pleased.  It's quick-service style-- you order at a counter, pay, then when your food is ready your number is called.  There are several lunch specials which are a great bargain-- I got the calzone special which came with a drink (and 2 toppings for the calzone) plus I added a side garden salad.  It was plenty of food and the total was less than $8.00.  The calzone came out nice and hot, with crispy crust (bottom crust, too!) and the fillings (I got pepperoni & onion) were tasty.  The side salad was a nice size and everything was fresh-- no soggy lettuce here.  One of us ordered the cheese bread, which was pizza crust with lots of melted cheese and a side of marinara.  This stuff could be addictive!  The marinara (which also came with the calzone) tasted homemade to me.  Another friend ordered the baked tortellini, which she really liked.  It came with two fresh breadsticks, and it looked so good that I'm definitely going to try it soon.  The menu includes wings (both regular and boneless), salads, stromboli, pizzas (of course!), subs, pastas and desserts.  Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time, especially considering we ate at peak lunch time on a Friday.  The cutlery is plastic, which I don't mind considering the prices, but it is a bit difficult to cut through calzone crust with a plastic knife.  My friend's pasta was baked in and brought to the table in a metal take-out container, but I thought that was really a great idea-- she couldn't finish it, and all she had to do was go get a lid for it when we were ready to leave.  The only prices over $10 are for large and extra large pizzas, and they apparently offer delivery.  Lunch business yesterday was brisk, and we're definitely going to go back.  I'm hoping that they are very successful, because it's really convenient to our office and it's nice to have this option so close-by.",

Considering I always order the same \"craft your pasta\" I know what it can be when cooked properly. The whole meal came out tonight and was COLD! Not even slightly warm. The chicken that was also ordered clearly was not grilled because it had fry grease all over it and he had a chicken wing in his pasta! So gross. It was also fried for so long that it darkened and was not edible. It just comes down to pure laziness in my opinion. Which is unfortunate because I won't be back after tonight. The remake that the host had made clearly was just thrown in a microwave to \"warm up\" and was even nastier then the first one. Nice gesture and I appreciate the extra effort put in by her but it just was overall disappointing. I hope they are willing to train their employees for consistency, because that's what helps you in the long run! Lost me after tonight!",

For guys who must watch sports while having dinner, yes there are a couple of big screen TVs for you as well.  You can also build your own of course. Oh, they just came out. One BBQ and one Garden!

The customer service was awesome; the hostess working was always checking in on us and delivered our food quickly after we ordered. And the food was delicious! The pizza had a medium crust thickness and was cooked perfectly. I would highly recommended both kinds of pizza, especially the Garlic White! Lastly, the prices were very reasonable. We ordered three Garden Salads, three drinks and a large pizza for about $30 and had a $5 off coupon bringing our total to only $25! Will definitely be going back, maybe to try a calzone or sub next time.",

It's now 9:00 still no pizza and they offered me a free drink for forgetting to make my Worked all day and very hungry wish I didn't get my hopes up for this one. Disappointed. Update next day -_-  Food was good large pizza was smushed in the box but at the end of the day still tastes the same.  Tried ordering for delivery to get a pizza and salad really quick.  Ordered pineapple personal pizza and a salad.  I get a call 25 minutes later.  \"Sorry we are out of pineapple\"  Ok green peppers and mushrooms then \"Sorry we are out of mushrooms\" Ok Italian sausage then \"Sorry we are out of that too\" Ok green peppers black olives and ... \"Sorry ma'am only two toppings\" What  whatever ok  \"Also we are out of eggs for your salad just letting you know  Ok fantastic that's great.   If you are taking someone here in a date I don't recommend it how can I have a bad experience two days IN A ROW. I'm not hard to please but I do give up on this place I'll stick with papa johns.",

We ordered a pepperoni pizza well done, and received a pizza that was completely burnt on the bottom.. I guess they should change \"well done\" to \"burnt\" on their website if that is what that is what they consider well done. We also received two orders of breadsticks considerably burnt.. I was shocked someone would actually put that in a box and serve to your customers. Unfortunately this isn't the first time this has happened. My family will definitely be taking a break from Farleys, the price and quality of food we are receiving is not matching up.",

I decided to go with the create your own pasta combo: Fettuccini noodles, grilled chicken, broccoli and Alfredo sauce. It came with two bread sticks and a drink for about $8-9. The portions were large so the price seemed reasonable. We also ordered the personal pizza combo for about same price. My only complaint is I was halfway done with my food and the pizza was still not brought to the table. At some point the waitress realized that the person with me was sitting there with no food and went to grab the pizza. I think it was ready shortly after pasta, she just became distracted and forgot about us. She apologized, smiled and thanked us for coming as we were leaving so overall I am pleased with this visit.",

    "text": "Within the last month or so, the service and product inventory is lacking.  The most recent order was Sunday at 5:20pm, placed online, 45 minutes for delivery, 6:20pm I called.....\"oh yeah yeah it's on the road should be there any minute\".  7:00pm I called....\"oh it's 1 minute away\".  Finally was eating my barely warm food at 7:20pm, two hours after I placed the order.  My order was complete except for the Greek salad dressing for my Greek salad, they were out, so they took it upon themselves to substitute it with ranch. The previous order about a month ago, no Greek salad dressing and no boneless wings, at least they called to let me know and give me the option of changing my order.  I get that they may have been short staffed of delivery drivers, but say that, update your online numbers and for goodness sake when someone calls be honest about where my food is.  I would have canceled my order, but given the previous experiences who knows how long it would take to credit my card. It will be a l.o.n.g time before I place an order with them again.  Not worth the $50.00 which included driver tip.  Driver received no \"extra\" tip, had a horrible attitude, some threatening comments as well when he was told we were not giving him a tip.",

    "text": "I stopped here for lunch one day and the line was extremely long.  I had to wait at least 20 minutes to place my order and then another 10-15 for my food to be prepared.  I would not suggest coming when you are on your lunch break.    I got a Stromboli with cheese in it.  It wasn't bad.  I have had better, it was a little greasy, but otherwise ok.  Tolerable.  The marinara sauce was pretty good and I enjoyed the flavor of that.  I would ask for an extra sauce next time, because it was rather small and the Stromboli is huge.    Service was ok, they were all very busy, so they definitely did a good job of keeping up with orders.  I would come back again try some of their other dishes at some point.  They have decent lunch specials and the pasta dishes looked pretty good as well.",

The roll was soft and delicious, and so was the whole sandwich.  We enjoyed every single bite.  The order of fries were crispy delicious, and one order was enough for both of us to share.  Now it will be a hard toss up of what to order... a sandwich or a pizza, because we love them both!",

    "text": "Went to eat with my family on a Friday evening. Got a 19 month old, a 7 yr old   and a 12 yr old. There is one other family eating. We place our order with the 2 young ladies at the counter. They look a lot like siblings. We sit down with our drinks and how our food brought to us.   Now that we're settled I realize there's music playing. Did i just hear what I think I did? So I guess one of the kids behind the counter decides to play hip-hop music and it is uncensored. I look at my sister in disbelief. They can't be serious! Every F- bomb every n-word every bitch and hoe came flying out those speakers.  We were horrified. These employees can't be serious! I know they see kids in here. This is not a club. It's an eating establishment for crying out loud. This place has ok pizza. Can't  say the same about the staff.",

The crust is pretty good and veggies are decent, which would've made for a great pizza experience, but the sauce (or lack thereof), is extremely bland and flavorless. Maybe this was a bad day or the person(s) preparing the pizza was being stingy. Either way I do not think I will order again.",

This is one of the few restaurants my best friend's Dad will go to - if he approves you know it's good.   I haven't tried everything here but I really like the pizza, pastas, subs & the fries. But the wings. Their wings are my favorite wings and my bf likes to order wings as an appetizer at most restaurants so I've had a lot of wings! Also they have homemade ranch and a Coke freestyle machine.  The employees are always super friendly as well.  Awesome place & close to I-85.  I'll probably be in Farley's sometime this week.",
