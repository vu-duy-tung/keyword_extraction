    "text": "****Short version: Went Fri for lunch around 12:30. By the time we came out at 1:45 we were still hungry and were exhausted from dealing with slow and unbelievably rude waitress. She did not check on us, my husband's drink stayed empty, had to physically go flag her down. When we mentioned the slowness of our order, she came up with every nonsense excuse she could and was downright rude to us saying she could bring us the check even though we only received 1/2 of our order.  ****With Details: We were seated at one of the booths tucked in the back. The waitress came by a little later to get our drink order and our first round of sushi order. The rule of the All-you-can-eat lunch, as stated on the menu, is that you can order 10 items at a time per person and if you don't finish your food, you will be charged extra - which is all fair considering no one wants to waste food. We waited for a bit and another waiter brought our first round of order. Now, during previous visits, we learned that the wait can be awhile for the order to come out so we always went ahead and placed a second round of order while we're eating the first order. But today by the time we were finished eating the first order and my husband's drink had been empty for awhile, the waitress never showed so my husband had to go find her to come to our table. We were fine with this. So we finally place a second round of order and waited for approx 30 minutes. When we realized that another party near us received their order awhile ago even though we placed an order before them, we flagged our waitress down and asked about our order. She said the other table got their sushi order first because they also ordered hibachi. Oooookay so if we order hibachi too somehow our sushi will be ready faster?? How does this make sense? We also ordered spring rolls and that hadn't come out either. She kept saying they are REALLY busy and they are working on our order. So we waited longer and still, no sushi. Once again the waitress kept saying they are REALLY REALLY busy and so I commented that we shouldn't have to wait this long just because they are understaffed, and she rudely said \"we are NOT understaffed, we are just really busy.\" Funny because the restaurant had less people there by that time compared to when we got our first order. She made it sound like she didn't do anything wrong at all and blamed everything else but herself. We did not appreciate her attitude so we told her if she had just checked up on us even once after the first round of order, we would have placed our second order sooner. Instead of acknowledging the fact that she never came by, she downright ACCUSED us of trying to break the \"rules\" and said we still had food left from the first order when we flagged her down to place the second order and by rule as it states on the menu she cannot take a second orders until we are finished eating the first order. First of all, I had ONE piece of nigiri on my plate when she was taking the second order and that was because we hadn't placed the second order yet and were eating intentionally slowly since we knew it might take a bit until the second order comes out, and we didn't want to be too long without any food. Second of all, nowhere on the menu does it state that we cannot place a second order when we are not done with the first order. And after eating there a few times before, we know the amount of food we can handle and we've always placed our second order right when we received the first order, and no one had a problem with this before. By the third time she came by again without our order, out of nowhere she actually asked us if we just wanted our check. Excuse me?? We told her we haven't finished eating and she said \"you had your first order and it was a big enough order.\" Did she seriously just say that?? It was uttering shocking. So finally she came by for the fourth time without our sushi, she said her manager okay'ed for us to pay 1/2 price. By this time we were tired of waiting and also tired of \"arguing\" with her, so we said fine. As she was leaving to get our check, another server finally brought our second order but we refused it since we had decided to leave. I guess that server was confused and told the owner that we wouldn't accept the order and the owner (Brian?) came by our table and asked what was going on. We ended up talking to him for about 5 minutes about what happened. He was trying in his own ways to make things better but it sounded more like he was making excuses for their slow service even saying one of his sushi chefs is really slow and that might explain why we didn't get our order for a long time when other tables did. He went ahead and took care of the bill even though we said we will pay.  We appreciated his attempt to fix the situation, but after such a frustrating and insulting experience with the waitress, it isn't enough for us to return to this restaurant.",

    "text": "Bad sushi, cheap manager. All you can eat sushi is a joke.  Tuna looked black, eal looked ill, rice 80%, fish 20%. Menu for all you can eat is poor. Only few selections for nigiri. It does say on the menu that you will be charged for wasted food, so i decided not to waste any and only left 50% of rice from 8 pieces of nigiri that i ordered, because rice tasted old and chewy.  I went to the chef and asked to put less rise in my next order. To my surprise sushi came with visibly more rise. In my bill i found a charge of 8 dollars for wasted rice. Rude manager said it was her who advised the waiter to add the charge and that we were warned and if  i wanted to eat less rice i needed to order from a regular menu and refused to wave the extra fee, saying that she is sorry  , but has to protect the restaurant. I have had sushi a la card and all you can eat  in many different cities, i know what i m talking about. Take your business somewhere else.",

First of all the restaurant week menu was generous (which honestly was a tie breaker about where to go when some places are getting stingy with the offerings, i.e. steak places where you need to pay extra for a steak).  The atmosphere was cool without being pretentious.  The service was very good and the food was excellent all around.  We enjoyed dumplings, filet stacker, tuna w/ seaweed salad, scallop hibachi and two specialty rolls.  While everything was very good, the sushi was definitely the star of the meal and as good as anything we have had in Charlotte.  We will definitely be coming back.    The only thing that could have taken away from the experience was the prospect of parking in the Met parking garage, but we went late on a Sunday and got lucky.  That parking garage is definitely the worst in Charlotte.",

It was around 9:30PM or 10PM and a bit late for anything heavy.  So, we kind of stumbled onto this place.  It is small and cute and a quite place to unload the days drama and enjoy eachother's company.   We sat at the sushi bar but they do have really cute little booths that are very private.  It was Wednesday night and the waiter tells us about the $4 Martini special.  Are you kidding.... yes please!  So, I drink my Orange Something Martini that was yummy yummy yummy and ordered the Miso soup and the Veggie Roll in the non-seaweed roll.  It was excellent.  Our waiter was quick to bring the refills and I left there in a much better mood then when I arrived.  Much love for Pisces....",

I like the fact that the rolls were small in this instance. The all you can eat is now 11.95, hate I didn't get there when it was 9.  From Nigiri we had the sake (salmon) and maguro (tuna) and from the rolls we had the asparagus roll, tempura maki roll, bagel roll, crab salad roll, california roll, spicy crab salad roll, unagi roll, we also had the garlic noodles and an order of fried rice. All were delicious and fresh. My favorite was the bagel roll and spicy crab salad. I heard a rumor from two Charlotte natives that this was their favorite sushi place because it is the only one they know of in Charlotte that gets daily seafood deliveries, don't know about that, but it sure is good and tastes fresh!

    "text": "Like a fine wine... this place just keeps getting better with age.  Now three plus years old, Pisces has expanded into the space next door to create a trendy bar and lounge area.  Cocktail genius Bob Peters continues to pull more tricks out of his bag. If you go to this place and order a Bud Light- you're doing it wrong. This is what real bartending is all about. Whether he's using a carbonator, playing with new liquor infusions or adding smoke to a cocktail... put your drink decisions in this man's hands. Intimidated? Tell him what you like. He'll come up with the perfect concoction for you.  Hungry? The best bang for your buck happens at lunch with the all you can eat sushi deal for $14.  My biggest problem at Pisces is narrowing down my order. I have to issue self-imposed restrictions or I will easily convince myself that I need five rolls. They're all delish but here are my current three favs (yes they change every few months):  Leo (tuna, mango, avocado and chili oil). I love the chili oil kick of this one.  Kissy (mango, crab, cream cheese in soy paper, re-wrapped with basil and rice paper) There is just something so clean and delicious about this roll.  XoXo (crab, avocado, topped with baked scallop and a honey mayo eel sauce) The topping just takes this roll to a new level.  I'm also a big of the Tuna Bruschetta for starters and Tempura Oreo with green tea ice cream for the grand finale.   For the late night crowd, Pisces also serves food til 2AM on weekends.  Need some entertainment for your food coma? Stare at the jellyfish tank. It'll hypnotize you for hours.",

The only thing I didn't like was the cocktails. I had a Bittersweet Symphony-- it just tasted like puree and ice. I was surprised there were no special martini's, like Lychee.  The food though-- soooo good. The bacon wrapped scallops. amazing!! we got 2 rolls and 4 sushi pieces. you can taste the fresh fish. We chose the Karyu and the Aries Rolls and 4 salmon nigiri pieces.  The place is not THAT big. My second drink was my standard Dirty Martini Straight up.  But Definitely going back to try more items.  It was very busy, so they are doing something right! I was surprised they had nothing with Smoked Salmon though. Oh well.",

    "text": "I came here for lunch a couple of weeks ago based on the awesome reviews. I think I had bigger expectations for this place. I got the unlimited sushi. They had a pretty good selection for only $10 a person, about 10-12 rolls to choose from. I got the spicy tuna, California, crab and shrimp tempura rolls. The rolls come out at 4 pieces. The sushi was OK. The rolls were kinda falling apart and difficult to keep together. It was made fresh, so that was a plus.   Also with the lunch special you can get garlic noodles, fries rice or a spring roll. I got the spring roll. It was good. I also took a sneak peak at there other rolls, which you can order for lunch and/or dinner.   Overall, if you're looking for some sushi for a great price come here. It's nothing to go crazy for, but I don't think any other Sushi places offer all you can eat for only $10 (plus they make it fresh and its not a buffet).   Ps. They offer the lunch specials on the weekend!",

They didn't have any of my favorite sake selections but they did offer several types.   The rolls are mall quality, slightly above grocery store, but below what other sushi places in the area have to offer.  The chopsticks are slick and awkward.",

And since the beginning of their sushi bar, they have grown to the space next door! My place to be...the lounge.  So these are the reasons why I love Pisces:  1. If you're like me and have a hard time thinking of a drink you want, you can definitely leave it up to the bartender here. They can make something random and it will be awesome!  2. Awesome service. I've never had a bad experience in this department. 3. Want to eat in the lounge? You sure can!  4. They have a jelly fish tank. Yeah, A jelly fish tank. 5. Live music on Saturday nights in the lounge.  6. TV's are always on the sports channels. (Even when Bobcats are playing against the Heats) 7. Good beers on draft. 8. (But honestly in the end it always comes back to alcohol/mixed drinks.) 9. And this place well, is the place to go for a mixed drinks with friends. That's probably the only reason I come out to bars is to try their creation and specialty drinks. Or else, I would be home drinking scotch.  So, yes. Check this place out. Anthony Hamilton did the other night, so be like a celeb (or just have fun) and watch the jellyfish go round and around the tank and get yo drink on!",

    "text": "My fiance and I ventured to Pisces for the first during this year's restaurant week. We made reservations for Friday night at 730pm. When we arrived we had to wait at the bar for our table (which was a bit odd due to our aforementioned reservation). After 10 minutes or so, we were seated close to the sushi bar. I would have preferred dining in the more cozy alcoves, being out in the open (and in the middle of the restaurant) was a bit loud and quite cold (turn off the AC, it's not that warm out!)   We decided to go with the restaurant week menu and added a couple of other items as well. We both had a glass of chardonnay and shared a bottle of nigori sake. Both were very good and complimented our sushi. We also liked the fact that the wine was included in our $30 meal. We ordered the crab dumplings and nawaii rolls for appetizers, both were incredibly flavorful. We also boldly ordered the little miniature crabs (I can't remember their name) and both found them surprisingly good (with the perfect amount of salt). For our entrees, we decided to order two sushi rolls each and a couple of pieces of nigiri. The fish was fresh and I appreciated that none of the rolls were drenched in sauce (as so many of them seem to be, particularly from other establishments). We particularly enjoyed the Slammin' Salmon roll. It had the perfect amount of salmon and cream cheese.   In terms of service, it was fantastic. Our waitress was personable and checked in on us the perfect number of times. And even though the restaurant was pretty crowded, we didn't have to wait long for our food (always a plus!)  Overall we had a great experience and a fun date night. We will definitely be returning to Pisces in the future!",

We went on a Friday night around 7pm or so, and while there were plenty of people there it was by no means packed. Though the hostess did scare me for a second when she asked if we had reservations after I asked for a table for two.   The main dining area is very modern and clean, you probably don't want to show up here in gym shorts and I even felt a little out of place wearing a pair of jeans. But we ended up being seated in the back room, which was very cool. Each table is tucked into it's own little compartment with a circle cut-out opening - a nice intimate setting for date night!  The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. We ended up getting \"The Love Boat\" - several different rolls and some nigiri. The nigiri was fantastic, the fish all tasted wonderful and fresh. The rolls for me weren't so great - two of the featured rolls are fried, the spicy tuna roll and the crispy California. I thought the spicy tuna had enough flavor to it that it actually tasted pretty nice fried. However, the crispy California was very bland and I think I would try to replace next time.   Overall, I would definitely go back. Between the service, atmosphere, and food I had a great time.",

They have two different sides to their restaurant one for day time dining and after a certain hour they open up the bar and lounge on the other side, ambiance and decor on both sides are great and go perfectly with the theme of each side. I do believe the menu is the same on both sides but don't quote me on that.  There is a bartender who works there, I'm not too good with names but, she makes a killer lemon drop martini, I am thrilled every time I go and she is working because I know it will be perfect every time.  The sushi menu here is fantastic and you cannot go wrong with any of the options. Raw or cooked you will find something that you love. They have a great lunch time all you can eat menu at a great price, you'll find some hibachi options as well as a few sushi rolls.  I was so caught up on the sushi I completely neglected the other items on the menu, that is until recently when I went in and was able to sit on the lounge side. The bartenders were great, they give you just enough attention and made sure you had everything you need without feeling over whelmed or bothered. I went with the sake instead of my usual martini, I love sake and they have great options to choose from even some flavored! I went with the calamari, which I always make a point to order because its sooo delicious, the spring rolls which are always good, I also had the dumplings, and the brussels sprouts, everything was awesome! awesome! awesome!. I might've went back on my word a tad and ordered one of my favorite rolls to top off the night, The Jumanji roll but what a perfect way to end my meal! I will make a point to try the spicy garlic edamame next time I heard it was phenomena!  The sushi chefs here are so very talented! EVERY TIME my sushi roll comes out I am floored at the literal piece of art that is presented to me! I'm always hesitant to eat it because it is so very beautiful! I appreciate the presentation every time!  This place never disappoints and the staff here is always friendly and service is untouchable. I will always be back!",

She recommended the cucumber special which was absolutely amazing!   I also had the Spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon hand rolls which were beautifully presented and also tasted wonderful.  The decor of the place is modern.  The tables are a little close together.    Prices are decent here except I thought the wine was a bit pricey.

I have also tried the Kawaii roll, which was crab, avacado, asparagus and cream cheese in a spring roll, served open faced I think.  It was very tasty.  I also tried a sushi roll that had crab and some other stuff but tuna and tomato on top.  Tomato wasn't needed but without it the roll was delicious.  Prices are decent, service is good.  We had received some cold veggies last time and the server/manager who dropped the dishes off ran right back to the kitchen and got us some new warm ones immediately.  We would have been happy to have them reheat what was on our plate, so I thought that was a nice touch. Only thing I dislike is the parking garage, its always sooo crowded!",

The bartenders pour a good beer and on Fridays the dude, Bob (I think?) makes a plethora of amazing mixed concoctions. This Bob feller (I think?) is also the bartender at Soul on Saturdays. Ask for him Bob (I think?) and he'll whip you up something nice.   With the expansion, the dinner area is separated very functionally from the lounge. Go in for Sushi and stop by in the adjacent room for a saki bomb.",

I love the set up, not too bright a good intimate feel but not very dark either. I have to give the drinks a 5 star rating they have amazing cocktails ...I however wasn't too impressed with my meal. The waiter was great but I don't like how the shrimp came out. I like my shrimp meaty texture (i.e Enso style) but theirs were like that squishy not cooked all the way type and I really don't like that. I actually ended up not eating my meal :-/. However, my friends chicken was really good so I didn't want to give them less than 4 stars just for the shrimp. I will go back for another dish and see how it goes.",

I guess it would have been fine if the sushi roll was amazing, but it was one of the worst ones I have eaten.  It was messy and not held together well and the tuna was like smushed in.  I was happy I didn't decide to order a more expense roll - they have ones that are on the menu at $20!  Our waitress was ok...not the friendlist or anything.

    "text": "Disclaimer: I go here a lot.  This was the place I \"learned to like sushi\", so I am probably biased.  I have been here for regular dinner, the lunch buffet, and restaurant week dinner.  I always have a service experience ranging from \"good\" to \"spectacular\", leaning towards the spectacular end of the spectrum.  The decor is also great, especially if you can talk them into seating you in one of the cave-like booths during lunch.  It's like eating at home, but with someone to wait on you!  As far as the food goes.... I have never, ever, not been \"wowed\" at Pisces.  The lunch deal features a very limited menu, but all of the rolls and ngiri offered are fresh and flavorful, and the garlic noodles are absolutely off the charts.  I've never been to RuSans for dinner, but their lunch buffet is soggy and flavorless compared to the made to order goodness that is Pisces.  As far as dinner-I always use restaurant week to sample 2-3 restaurants in charlotte that I wouldnt normally go to and Pisces provided one of the best restaurant week experiences.  The menu was extensive, the portions generous, and the rolls I had were amazing.    I realize the outflow of positive adjectives is reaching absurd levels here but this place is just great.  I've had sushi 4-5 places in Charlotte and this tops them all.  Go eat!",

One other issue is that it is in the Met, which means parking is a giant pain, not their fault.   Overall, I will add it too my list of sushi places, but not close to my favorite.",

    "text": "I love, love, love this place. The atmosphere is trendy but not pretentious. And the sushi is always on point.  Ever since my boyfriend practically forced a california roll down my throat 3 years ago, I've been in love. We've been all over Charlotte- from Akahana (gross and overpriced), Rusans (decent, tho small speciality selection), Sushi 101 (okay), and none of them ever come close to the quality experience we get each time at Pisces. I wouldn't care if this place was located in an east side strip mall I'd still be there every weekend. Thankfully, it's right around the corner from me at the Met. And while parking can be horrendous, it still can't affect my mood once I cross their threshold.  To start we always get a Kawaii roll. Which is just a fried spring roll with asparagus, crab stick, and cream cheese with an orange/vinegar dipping sauce. The simplicity gets me everytime. What my mouth experiences once I take that first bite is outta this world. The flavor combo is just awesome. We've ordered other apps that were all uniquely awesome in their own way but this one is a staple for each visit.  Next is the reason we keep coming back. The speciality rolls. Like I said, I started out slow, ya know, beginner rolls, nothing too exciting. Pisces is the only place I will eat flat out-laid out raw fish on my sushi. Other places I may get the spicy tuna or something with crab and shrimp. Oh no, not here. The fish is so fresh it can't be beat by anywhere else in Charlotte. They were the first place I ever tried spicy tuna, and it is seriously the best spicy tuna, THE BEST.   You can't go wrong with any of the speciality rolls, or any rolls for that matter. But we like to experience the creative flavor pairings they've created. For example, the Kissy roll. It's wrapped in soy paper with a bit of mango, crab, cream cheese, then rewrapped with basil and rice paper. Yes, basil. And it adds something unexplainable. Something..almost magical? Get it, you won't regret it. We also like to get some additional orange/vinegar sauce from the Kawaii roll to dip our other rolls in to. But that may just be an us thing. We've tried pretty much every speciality roll on the menu and have never been disappointed.   Now the service. While we may run in to a junior waiter here and there, when we get the OG servers it always makes up for any previous semi-lack luster server experience. We have a few that immediately recognize us and we get that star treament that can only come when you've stuffed hundreds of dollars of rolls in your mouth. Service is quick, casual, and on point.   Drinks. While the mixed drinks can add on quite a bit to your total if you stop paying attention, we've learned to just stick with a bottle of sake. We prefer something a little delicate to pair with the standout flavors of our rolls. We stick with the Hana brand sake in fuji apple or white peach. Either one you can't go wrong.  After hearing so many of my friends preaching religiously about Rusans, my suggestion is to just go try Pisces. I know there are some die-hards out there for Rusans but seriously, this place has never disappointed me. AND you can make online reservations, ask for a booth in the back corner. It's a nice little back alley with covered booths for an intimate dining experience. And yes, this place is an experience. Enjoy!",

I started off with fried gyoza(potstickers) and crab dumplings which were both pretty good....one served with chili sauce the other served with ponzu. The hibachi salmon was served with rice, mixed veggies(broccoli, mushrooms, onions, and zucchini) which were a little greasy due to being drowned in butter and oil. The salmon was borderline dry but had a good flavor, the rice was average as was the veggies....server Edward is the type of server every restaurant should have...very helpful, knowledgeable and patient as I am the most indecisive foodie ever, he was very honest about the menu items and didn't hesitate to give you his opinion...the other servers congregated at the bar clueless and hugging on each other(not a good look).....thank goodness they have Edward, gotta love that type of server. 3 stars for the food plus an additional star for great service from Edward..",

Got our order under way and was very quick about it.    Our visit was pretty great as usual and we shouldn't have doubted it even one second.    The best Sushi place I have eaten at in Charlotte.

    "text": "I wish I could've given more stars because the food quality is always on point at this place and very fresh. However, because of the level of customer service I would've liked to have given 0 stars. Customer service can make or break an establishment. Recently I popped in for lunch with a few of my co-workers and we selected the \"all-you-can-eat\", food was excellent! My friends and I are until we were nearly stuffed and ready to pop. There were three remaining pieces of sushi (avocado and cucumber), and neither of us could eat another piece seriously. The young lady comes to our table and we asked for the check, and she stated \"I'm going to have to charge you'll extra for the three pieces that you didn't eat\", and I asked why and she stated \"we reserve the right to charge for what you waste and don't eat because sushi is expensive\". I explained to her that I was familiar with their policy and that I understood how expensive sushi can be, however the policy doesn't stipulate what's considered waste and that taken into account the type of roll we had leftover in comparison to all that we had consumed, was it really waste? The waitress was adamant about the policy and so was I on my stance of how waste is determined in their establishment. Also the policy says that they reserve the right to, but I wonder if they always do, or was my waitress just being a jerk. We ate the three little rolls, but it left a very bitter taste in my mouth for this establishment. Let's be clear, one cucumber makes nearly 100 rolls in this place considering how tiny they cut it up. Either way, if I ever eat here again, I'm going to be adamant about my food coming out individually because the \"waste\" wasn't even mine, however everything was on one tab that day so I ultimately was going to have to pay for it, but never again. To avoid \"waste\" I want my own plate! Thank you FYI... the cucumber and avocado roll sounds tasty but lacks in flavor, nothing special about it! It tastes just as plain as it sounds!",

I wasn't always a fan of sushi but I've been expanding recently and decided to give this place a try. It's hard to find good sushi deals where the sushi is actually legitimate. After doing some hardcore Yelp research Pisces was the place.   Located in the Metropolitan area surrounded by other great restaurants and places to shop you are sure to find something to spend your evening doing... other then enjoying great sushi!   Happy hour has the best prices so don't miss out on that! It really allows you to try a lot of different rolls. Each one is superbly crafted and not just thrown together half heartedly. I'll definitely be going back when I'm in the sushi mood.",

    "text": "My nieces first time having Sushi!!!!!   This was my second time visiting Pisces. I brought my niece along to try sushi for the first time. She's new to the Queen City. From my understanding, Indiana has limited options when it comes to food.   We arrived around 11:30AM before the lunch crowd. My niece browsed the menu. She asked a few questions then proceeded to order. The waitress and I were stunned when she ordered the Tuna Roll...Tuna??? What??? Yes!! Go for it!!   Here's another first!!! My niece also used chopsticks. She struggled a few times, but never gave up! I was so proud of her!! The sushi was WONDERFUL!!! She definitely enjoyed every bite!!   Our waitress was patient and kind.... thank goodness. I look forward to building even more precious memories as a new Aunt/mentor. So thank you Pisces for taking care of us today! This has been a unforgettable experience!!!",

Then the hostess takes us around the corner to the booths, each one behind a circular entrance. I love the design, giving the appearance of some privacy, making dinner feel a bit more intimate.  We shared fried calamari, two sushi rolls and some shrimp hibachi. I also had a cocktail, but I can't remember the name. All of the food and drink was delicious. I felt that the calamari appetizer could have been a bigger portion. My date ended up ordering another. It's possible we are spoiled by Rusan's mega portions. That did not change the fact that we enjoyed the food, and the environment. I'm looking forward to visiting Pisces again.",

We did the all you can eat lunch special, which is an awesome deal, but the sushi itself was just \"meh.\" Service was kind of slow. There was no soy sauce on our table and our dishes were pretty greasy and gross. I felt too grossed out to use the reuse-able chopsticks they gave us. The atmosphere was okay, we were sat in a booth which had a lot of privacy, which was nice, but the seats were worn down and it smelled kind of like cleaning supplies. Won't be my first choice again unless I'm really craving some cheap sushi.",

    "text": "This restaurant will get you sick. I had such severe food poisoning after eating here that put me in the hospital. The quality of fish used should have been a red flag in the first place but because it was a cheap lunch buffet, I ignored it. Will never visit this place again and I highly recommend finding somewhere else to go for a sushi buffet. There are too many options in Charlotte to subject yourself to low-quality fish.  To elaborate and provide guidance to those reading:  The hostess/servers are rude and slow. Expect to be ignored.   I started with the gyoza which was pretty good. From there I chose to upgrade the buffet $5 with the Nigiri option - probably where everything went wrong.   I ordered the tuna and salmon nigiri which both came out off-colored. Sushi grade fish is known for its vibrant colors, this looked like it had been sitting for a month. It tasted that way as well so I moved on to the rolls.   When they brought out the rolls, I chuckled because it looks like a toddler was in the back smashing rice around the fish and then throwing it on the plate. It was 9/10 rice with a smidge of fish. (Ordered Philly, jalapeno, & shrimp tempura).So we ordered more because we were hungry after the first rolls. The second round came out just as bad (ordered crab salad & spicy tuna). Sushi can be better made at home.   It was a late lunch so we didn't eat for the rest of the day. The symptoms began immediately on Sunday morning and by Tuesday, I was in the ER.   Overall, terrible experience during and after.",

We were seated in the back booths (actually really cool booths with rounded ceilings made to feel like small rooms), and it took 5-10 minutes for our server to even come to our table. After she took our drink orders, she disappeared for another 10 mins and then came back apologizing for the WRONG wine not being ready. I corrected her and we put in our food orders. We ordered the garlic edamame (amazing!), pineapple chicken and the fineapple express roll. It took longer than acceptable for the food to come out again. My fiance's chicken dish was really tasty and a large serving size. My roll however was probably one of the smallest rolls I have ever had. The flavor was great and fresh but unfortunately the roll itself was tiny. Our server returned and asked if I wanted a refill of another type yet of the WRONG wine. Of course when we asked for the bill she was attentive in bringing it and returning us the card, much quicker than she had been all night. Not sure if we will be back",

If you want rolls and rolls of sushi, do the ACYE option! I do feel like the menu is quite limited - lots of \"plain\" rolls. You can upgrade to fancier rolls, but we didn't. When you go for all you can eat, I don't want to upgrade, I just want what they have to offer.   Like I mentioned, the rolls are very plain. They're all in a standard California roll set up - just with different meat/fish/veg inside. No fish on top, not really too much sauce on top. But, if that's what you're looking for, then this is great! I do think the fish quality was very nice, especially for the price.  The other items on the ACYE menu were different types of noodles, fried rice, egg rolls, gyoza, etc. The standard Asian appetizers.   I enjoyed the lunch, I think it's a freakin' steal for the amount of food you can order... but I do wish they would expand their AYCE menu into something with more pizazz. Some other appetizers, a fancier type of roll or two...",

The alcohol selection was decent, plenty of wine and sake to choose from and a few craft beer options. The food was ok. Good selection of sezchuan options but a fairly small sushi menu. No menu of traditional sushi or simple rolls but a couple dozen special rolls. Most seemed to feature spicy tuna and deep frying and several had mango. As someone who really likes well made raw rolls, I wasn't super impressed. I enjoyed trying some new things but didnt get too excited about anything.",

What I discovered is one of the best lunch values in Charlotte, served up at an unassuming sushi restaurant in the Metropolitan.   Yes, for just ELEVEN DOLLARS, you can enjoy as many sushi rolls, Nigiri, or Tuna pieces as you can handle, along with fried rice, garlic noodles and spring rolls. And if that's not enough, you can add a Miso Soup and Ginger Salad for just $2 more. We enjoyed a delicious order of California, Yellowtail and Tempura Shrimp rolls, then mixed in a Spicy Salmon roll on round two. Service was prompt and friendly, and there are a fair number of local craft brews on tap, along with saki and wine.   A recent expansion has nearly doubled the restaurant's seating capacity, but their amazing lunch offer ensures the place fills up quickly by 12:15. So get there early, grab a table, and enjoy what may the best sushi deal in the Queen City!",

Also, they just added a jelly fish tank! =D  I came to Pisces for lunch to try their sushi buffet. Contrary to most buffets, Pisces provides you with a menu to order. Once you've made your choices, the servers bring the dishes to your table. Be sure not to order more than you can eat because they will charge you extra! The sushi is very fresh, especially for a buffet. Our food came out fairly quickly every time we ordered something new, especially since everything is made to order. I recommend the garlic noodles. They come with the buffet and are delicious!  Overall, I think Pisces is a good place to go to when you just want a variety of sushi. It isn't amazing, but it's pretty decent for a buffet. Plus, you can always come to just check out the jelly fish! :)",

Spicy garlic edamame were good but I think I prefer plain old edamame. Chicken habachi was good and also very good portions. The sushi girl at the table liked it but didn't love it.

I pay that for a roll smothered in fish and that is justified but a veggie roll with more rice than any goodies isn't worth my money. I personally wouldn't go back to this place, not even take out.

The rest we ordered was sushi. We ordered just a plain maki roll and one of the specialty rolls. We had the screaming O roll which was delicious, especially if you're a tuna fan.  We also ordered a drink each, we both tried a different kind of their infused vodkas. They were really good and were easy drinking. I had strawberry and my boyfriend had blueberry.  The service was really friendly and made me feel relaxed. I might be biased because our servers name was Amanda,  but she was really witty and made us laugh the whole time.

They have awesome weekday deals and all you can eat sushi weekdays from 11:30am to 2:00pm (or somewhere in that time frame) so even big eaters can enjoy this spot!",

Oddly enough, the hostess was great, the waitress was great at first, and the manager even came by the check on us.  However, the minute we got our food, the fella ordered a glass of wine, and waited.... and waited... and waited.  We were sitting about 15 feet from the bar, so we saw the glass sitting there, but our waitress - and all the other waitresses - seemed to disappear.  We could see a few people gathered around it at the bar, but no one was delivering it.  This whole time, I was also out of water.  After 20 minutes, the fella finally got up and actually got it himself (after confirming with the bartender that it was his).  Sadly, the good food just doesn't make up for such consistently inconsistent service.",

Take your traditional Manhattan (whiskey or bourbon, bitters, sweet vermouth and don't forget that cherry) and put it on a flight to Hong Kong and this is what you'll get: A delicious concoction of rye bourbon, ginger liqueur, sparking sake and bitters. Sweet, smooth, spicy.  I am a sucker for anything ginger, so I had high hopes for this cocktail and it did not disappoint.   I am not going to try to guess the alcohol content of this beverage, but let's just say that I was in no position to order a second. Next time I will bet trying the Shiso martini: orange vodka, ginger liqueur (yeah!), barley liqueur and fresh shiso. I'm counting down the minutes...  The food was good too! You can't go wrong with their seaweed salad and simple but fresh sushi menu.  I respect the lack of bells and whistles. Definitely ask for one of the intimate booths in the back if you're feeling romantic like that.",

The sushi options were very creative and the rolls my boyfriend and I ordered (Crunchy Spicy Tuna, Leo, Eel Special, Spicy Tuna) were delicious. However, the service was not as satisfying.  I watched as our sushi sat at the bar, waiting for pick up, for about ten minutes. Meanwhile, our server milled about the restaurant doing nothing in particular. When our food was finally delivered, she had requested that tobiko be put on the wrong roll. Not a problem, I just requested some extra on the side for the naked roll. Our server agreed to the request then disappeared. She didn't come near our table again until the meal was over, and then offered me the side of tobiko with a smug, \"well I guess it's a little late\".  I got her name off the receipt, and if I return, I will not be sitting in her section. The food at a restaurant can be incredible, but bad service can make or break a meal. I hope that this is something the management recognizes and works on.",

I'm not aware of anywhere in the area where you can get this array of blue fin tuna cuts.  Pisces latest choice of fish purveyors is spot on.  Please keep buying from this source...it makes all the difference.   The crunchy fresh water crabs were unique,  creative,  and tasty. The garlic chili edamame get high marks for texture and flavor.  Servers were knowledgeable, responsive, and helpful. Cocktail menu creative and well made drinks.

Aside from being dark and small it was kinda uncomfortable to get into.  Not going to say what I had was bad, but it wasn't worth +$15 and it was a bit messy and all over the place when I would try to eat it. If you want really great sushi then this probably isn't the place, all you will get here is a pricey messy roll.",

To give a fair comparison to other Charlotte Sushi places, I ordered 2 of their signature rolls. One featured spicy jalapenos,  the other had filet mignon on top. Both were good and fresh. But both were also missing that Wow factor....that je ne sais quois.  Now the bartender was awesome, and his drinks rocked! But for 2 rolls and 2 drinks, that set me back $75 (including tip)!  To me, the best Sushi I have had in Charlotte so far still is Sushi Guru in Southpark. Their Sushi Guru Roll is TO DIE FOR! If anyone out there has other suggestions for great sushi place then pease let me know. I lived out West for 6 years so I know good Sushi.",

However, Pisces offers really great options for vegetarians and people that like to go the cooked route with their sushi. One of my favorite rolls is the Yellow Submarine, a shrimp tempura and cream cheese roll topped with mango & eel sauce. I've also had the Taurus Veg, which is sweet potato, cucumber, avocado and mango wrapped in sesame soy paper. Added to my list of tries is the Kissy, Lil' Bastard, and Crystal Veg. All AMAZING. I love how many options I have here and how unique the flavor profiles are. The tempura fried Oreos with green tea ice cream is something I dream about still. So, so good. Although I don't order the raw fish options, I see them come out to the tables around me and they look extremely fresh and well made. You can see the chefs working at a bar right in the dining room. Great option for sushi night!",

This is not the \"Oh hey are you ok...ok good\". You can tell she genuinely cared about how are evening was going. I have literally tried sushi from here to Timbuktu and this is by far the best sushi. We also tried the Saki \"Leechi\" which was delicious. A bit pricey but well worth it.

The only downside was service was fairly slow",

I don't believe restaurants should be putting strong scents into the air if they are serious about serving food.  I left wondering why they were doing that.  We aren't sure we will be back.",

My friend and I ordered similarly; chilled cucumber salad with a sashimi pick and sides. We loved how the refreshing salad acted as a palate cleanser. My friend noted the dish reminded her of poke with less oil. We split the garlic edamame and roasted brussel sprouts. Both were deliciously satisfying and packing substantial flavor. Our tuna and salmon sashimi orders rounded out the pairings. Super fresh and light! This is by far my favorite sushi spot in Charlotte and can't wait to try more menu items.",

My new friend took here in my first weekend in town, and now I'm kinda hooked on Pisces. Also, Pisces is my sign ha ;)   We went on a Saturday for a late lunch and it was packed. Thankfully, we were seated right away. I got the Chicken and Shrimp Hibachi entree, which was served with garlic noodles (extra $1) along with miso soup and ginger salad. Also, we had an order of Crab Dumplings to share, and Holy Moly, those were ridiculously delicious!   Pro-tip: Check out their made to order all-you-can-eat Sushi lunch for $11.00/person: with 26 Sushi rolls options (all rolls are 1/2 of a full roll: aka 4 pieces-which you can't get it to-go btw) and kitchen items like fried wonton strips, fried rice, garlic rice, veg. spring rolls and fried pork. However: - Keep in mind you might be fined for all-you-CAN'T-eat-Sushi if you wasted too much food, as they're trying to avoid food wastage.  - Nigiri cost $5 extra.  ... And for those who doesn't know about the specials and lazy to find out, here's the scope: Mondays: Half price wine glasses. Tuesday: Half price sake. Wednesday: Half price wine bottles. Thursday: Half price cocktails. And it gets better, - Daily: $4 Sapporo drafts. - Weekday Happy hour 4pm-6pm Sushi & apps  Sadly, Pisces Sushi Bar is closed on Sundays. Pisces, I'll be regular!

The waitress literally came off threatening about explaining how it worked and was so serious about it. It also took me a long time between sushi orders to get my sushi when the restaurant really wasn't busy. I will still come here but they need some improvements for sure to stay relevant towards all the other amazing sushi places I've been too. Sushi was too ugly to take and lost a pict",

After hearing rave reviews from colleagues and friends I decided to give Pisces a try for a quick lunch.   Walked in around 12:00 and was told there was a wait for at table despite half to the place being empty. Happily sat at the bar to avoid the seemingly unexplainable wait. Ordered the AYCE sushi because why not? Well I will tell you why not...the rolls are poorly constructed. I get serving in half orders to cut down on waste, but the rolls are really small and the rice to filling ratio is very clearly off to cut costs. Was kind of confused by their menu as there were a lot of options with Mango asked the waitress about it and she just shrugged and gave some sarcastic quip. I was genuinely interested about the mango and if the place was going for a fusion vibe, but clearly the bartender didn't seem interested in answering questions.   The service only went down hill from there, the bartender was surprisingly never behind the bar, thus making refills and a reorder basically impossible. Literally had to flag her down from across the restaurant. To make matters worse I could hear a male staff member making remarks about the appearance of a patron to another staff member, not the place or time.",

    "text": "I've been here for the all you can eat lunch special that they have more times than I can count so here we go....  When I'm dining by myself (which is 98% of the time), I get the Pork Gyoza as my starter- they used to give 4 but they've reduced it to 2 which doesn't matter because you can always order more. The garlic noodles are good too and they give a pretty big portion so it's a great option for sharing.   I always order green tea with my meal and since I usually get the same server, she always hooks me up (I don't remember your name, but you're the best).  The choice of rolls on the AYCE lunch menu are pretty basic, but you want to make sure you know what to order and what to stay away from because they will charge you full price for whatever you don't finish...  I mainly stick to the yellowtail, salmon and tuna options because I honestly feel as though I'm getting more bang for my buck that way, but there are other options like crab salad and \"vegan\" options like avocado and sweet potato...   *SIDE NOTE* the sweet potato roll is literally a sweet potato fry rolled up in sushi rice. Literally.  Dassit.   The crab salad roll is made with imitation crab meat so I wasn't a big fan of it. The eel avocado roll is my favorite- I love the sauce they put on it. Sometimes I scrape off some of the sauce and put it on my other rolls. It's THAT bomb.  The rolls are about half the size of a regular sushi roll and you only get 4 pieces of each of the roll(s) you order which isn't a big deal IMO because you can always order more of something you really like.  *ANOTHER SIDE NOTE* I have noticed that when you get there after 2pm the sushi isn't cold like you'd expect it to be; it's actually pretty much room-temperature which bothered me a lil bit so I make it a point to come in earlier...  All in all, $12 for AYCE sushi hits the spot for me. The rolls are very basic (and small) but I mean, how much do you REALLY expect for $12...?",

I'm not sure if it's intentional with the all you can eat but at 1:00pm on a Tuesday, with a half full restaurant, it took nearly an hour total for one main order then one reorder.   I sat at the bar and they have the person working the bar also handling multiple tables. At times, it was tough to get her attention because she was constantly having to run around to tables. I put my initial order in at 12:55 and it arrived at 1:25. Watching the three sushi chefs, it is clear they are not trying to get rolls out quick. Second order went in at 1:32 and did not come until 1:51, only after the server sensed the frustration of myself and another individual at the bar who ordered at the same time. She went over and within minutes our rolls were actually made.   But overall the sushi is good for all you can eat and has a wide selection. You can't beat the price so I guess you are getting what you pay for when it comes to waiting on the food/service. I would say it's realistically, the quality and selection warrants 4-5 stars but it really drags it down when you know you can't come in and get your monies worth within an hour lunch break. I am being generous to the business and rounding up rather than giving three stars.",

Didn't get a chance to take pictures of the seating they have cool seating areas here that makes you feel like you are entering a space ship or something.

They have the best garlic noodles I've ever had and people love the veggie spring rolls too! The owner is a young guy, who is super nice and friendly. We witnessed him handle a table of jerks next to us and he did it beautifully, with patience and professionalism. I am always up for supporting small businesses especially when the owner is great, More reason to come back!",

    "text": "My colleagues and I often go here for their AYCE lunch special. Can't go wrong with a $12 AYCE lunch (including soup and salad), $10 only if you want sushi and app items. They have some good rolls, none are specialty, but above the basic. AYCE Sushi I recommend trying:  - Crunchy Roll - Spicy Tuna - Spicy Salmon - Eel Avocado - Eel Cucumber - Tuna Avocado  AYCE Kitchen items: - Pork Gyoza - Veg Spring Roll  You must eat all or it's $1 per left over roll!!  One of my colleagues swears by the hibachi plate. He always gets that when the rest of us pig-out on sushi. ha ha  Ambiance - trendy, dim lighting, would be good for dinner date or something \"special\". Have been going with the hubs for dinner and it gets crowded. Might spot a Panthers player, as some live within the condo complex!  Usually I would give this place a 4, but since my last visit (haven't been there since) I only give it a 2 and here is why:  We had our usual lunch pow-wow and were ready to pay. We all paid separate, which we never had a problem before. This time when our server (also the bartender) returned our cards / checks I've noticed one of my colleagues card missing. The check showed that she had ran it, so he did give it to her (checked on name on receipt too, in case she had ran a card twice or something). We brought it to her attention and at first swore that she had returned it. She even said \"i ran it, so you can just sign it\"...uhm hello? It's a bright red bank of america card, we noticed it was not on the black check booklet. She attempted to look around our table - as we lost it. Maybe, but before putting it to her attention, we (3 of us) had checked thoroughly. The server walked back and forth the bar / register, re-tracing her steps. looking on the ground, nothing. Probably 10 minutes go by. I even went to other tables which had received checks and were left on the table to see if it was tucked in with those. nothing. Another 5 minutes go by, what I believe the manager came over - but she didn't introduce herself. We just told her what happened and she also just looked on the ground using her cellphone as a flashlight.....20mins in, my colleague is ready to call his bank to cancel the card and we had told it to the server and the \"manager\". Nothing. Sever went back to the bar for a bit as the \"manager\" looked on the ground around our table. They were both apologetic, but 20mins in, I would have expected some kind of action, even give my colleague the meal ($8+soda) for free in lieu of the hassle and having to get a new card (it was Friday, so he would have had to wait till Tuesday, if the bank can overnight it, perhaps even for a fee - a new card sometimes cost $10 depending on your bank).  Server returns with the card...she apologized for the hassle. We were all relieved. I had asked where she had found the card, apparently she had THROWN IT OUT WITH THE DUPLICATE PAPER................................... THROWN IT OUT! eh ok. then she said \"oh you don't need to tip me\". WHAT? that's all you can offer? Call me a snooty NYer, but i would have given my colleague a free meal at least, if not a coupon for a free meal next time (if he decides to go back). For the hassle - work lunch, 30mins delay for 3 people to return to work.....i dunno, something.   Sure enough, I haven't returned since then. Maybe i'll check it out again, hoping the server / bartender is not there. Not sure, but that experience just doesn't sit well for me. Too bad, it was a good deal and delicious, but service belongs to the experience as well.  4 stars for the food 0 stars for guest experience averages to 2 stars.",

Called ahead to surprise the couple we were going with that had recently gotten engaged with a bottle of champagne and the woman that assisted me, Breanna was an absolute sweetheart!! So helpful, so kind and so accommodating. I was happy to see that the level of service I received from her was the same that we received from every member of their staff we encountered all the way up to their Asst GM. They made the couple feel so special and it was beyond anything I could have imagined and it was so appreciated! And then to complete the perfection puzzle, the food and cocktails were amazing!!! The appetizers were the perfect size to share (crab dumplings, holy delicious), sushi was fresh and well prepared and the dessert was fantastic (chocolate lava whatever the heck it was.. Out of this world, would go back just for that. I'm serious)  Will definitely return next time in the area, it's a must!!!",

Unlimited garlic noodles (along with things like spring roles, fried rice) are part of the options.  They can be hit-or-miss, but when they're good, it's hard to get enough.  Huge variety of sushi options.  Plenty for vegetarians and non-fish-fans.  Try the crunchy rolls.",

Nagiri (sushi with the fish on top of the rice) is an additional $5. The buffet also includes rice, garlic noodles and spring rolls. The appetizers are just filler in my opinion and not that good.  I've definitely had better sushi, and the sushi at Pisces is just ok and didn't taste that fresh. However, you're getting unlimited of it and can eat all you all you can for $10-$15, so it offsets (depending who you ask).  The sushi had a lot more rice compared to fish, and the rolls weren't executed cleanly (doesn't take an expert to see this).  Service was pretty slow and the ambience is cool except for those back booths where they seated us.  Not amazing by any means but if you're craving a sushi buffet for relatively cheap then go for it.",

Only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that all of the salmon was a little chewy instead of buttery like I'm used to. Would definitely return.",

    "text": "Similar to other reviews, let's be honest, I went here for the $10 sushi buffet during weekday lunch. Between my friend and I, we tried several different rolls. They're all basic and you get four pieces of each, so not a full roll like you'd get at other places. My favorite was the eel and avocado, seemed to have the most substance. The crispy roll is a skip, it literally was like tempura flakes rolled in seaweed and rice. Didn't taste extremely fresh, but for $10, how high can your standards really be?   Rolls weren't anything spectacular, fried rice (also included in the all-you-can-eat) was not your typical fried rice, it was sticky rice that looked like they tossed some carrots in. I wouldn't order it again. The spring rolls were just okay, sauce was at least yummy. Service seemed slow for a weekday lunch, after I arrived it took forever for our waiter to come back and take our order, but he was semi-attentive after that until the place started to fill up. He at least didn't let our drinks go empty. If I return, I'd probably order a roll off the actual menu next time.",

If you get those amazing booths that have darkness and privacy, you're golden. But if you are at one of the tables and there are tons of other people out there, too, you can't even have a conversation without yelling at your friends. The acoustics in there are insane. It's the opposite of a nice, inviting place to have a meal. The only time I've ever had a bad experience was when I went in for an early dinner, around 4:00, on a weekend and we asked our server if we could sit in one of the booths...and she straight up said no. There were people still in one booth (I assume left over from lunchtime) and I totally get that she was the bartender and she would have to walk an extra 20 feet to serve us (which she explained)...but, before we even got our food, we were the only customers in there, one table of four. Granted, I had a bad day earlier, so it upset me more than it usually would. But, even on a good day, I thought that was kind of messed up. When we first arrived, there was a table of what appeared to be coworkers having lunch together and they were so obnoxiously loud, we couldn't hear a single word any of us were saying. Hence, the request for a booth. Luckily they left right before we were served our food.  Oh well. Just one bad experience out of a whole bunch. But, I'd rather warn someone else about it and save them slight unhappiness than let it go.",

Even though it was early lunch time when we arrived, there was a good vibe coming off the place. The large bar area and the private booths in the back looked very comfy, but we took seats in the middle of the dining room.  Opting for the all-you-can-eat, the sushi is prepared when it is ordered as opposed to the buffet-style at other places. A handful of hot plates (noodles and such) are complimented by a few different nigiri-sushi, (salmon, tamago, mackerel, etc) and a dozen or so temaki rolls. Don't expect anything earth shattering, but the stuff that they do offer is good, quality sushi that isn't nearly all rice.  Our waitress was quite attentive, refilling sodas before they were empty and getting our sushi orders before the plate was gone.  Is it the best in Charlotte? Maybe not. Is it the best ayce in Charlotte? Possibly.",

That just was not the case.  The service was quick and prompt. The quality was just lacking. I came here for the unlimited sushi lunch, and every roll I got was probably 80% rice and had very little fish in them. The best one was probably the spicy crab ... everything else was meh. I don't know if lunch is just this way, because many others have said the dinner rolls are great proportions. Based on my experience with various lunch rolls, I definitely would not recommend this place for lunch over many other tried and True sushi joints.",

Their spicy crab salad roll only is crab salad with a line of Siracha, which might be my only complaint, but the crab salad is flavorful. Also, their garlic noodles and spring rolls are delicious, so save room for them, or at least a spring roll.",

Most of us got the rolls, one got the calamari, and we all got the crab dumplings and endamame as an appetizer.  Personally I got the XOXO roll which was warm and had scallops and other goodies inside.  It was the best one, a bit too much mayo on top but really good.  The rainbow roll was good and another one of my favorites, the spider roll was excellent.  Then let me tell you about dessert - omg, you MUST get the fried oreo dessert with a scoop of vanilla bean or green tea ice cream.  It is to die for.  Always a pleasure to eat here !",

For one, it's got to be the most laid-back atmosphere I've ever experienced at a sushi joint. That does not mean the service is listless, It's not. It just has a cool vibe w/ the circular booths, the jellyfish fish tank, and now w/ their new lounge. I suggest everyone start off w/ one of Bob Peter's (best bartender in Charlotte) custom cocktails. Just tell him what you usually drink, and he'll blow your mind w/ something you've never even thought of. As far as the sushi, it's topnotch. At this point, I just tell them to surprise me, and they bring out something delicious every time. There are a few don't miss items: the \"Screaming O roll\" is my favorite, w/ \"the Pisces roll\" a close second.",

Not all rolls are available on the all you can eat menu, but I'm not complaining, the food that is on the menu is great! They even have inari, whish is difficult to find sometimes. I recommend you try one. For all you can eat lunch, you get to pick up to 10 items at a time per person. once you get you items, don't hesitate to order more as long as you know you will be able to eat the majority of it without being wasteful.",

They held it for 40 minutes after I called so that was appreciated, but we lost our table and was fortunate to find a seat at the bar. We met Bob and he was awesome. Live music from guy playing cover songs on guitar, which was great especially when he played classics. Hibachi is hard to find in Charlotte and I can see why. The food wasnt the special yummy Hibachi I am used to up North but I wouldn't  mind going back for drinks and live music.",

    "text": "It's a trendy new place to hang out. The food (sushi) is OK. I lived in Japan for a while, and enjoyed sushi there very much, but I'm not a picky gourmet eater or anything and find most of American style sushi pretty decent, though entirely \"different\" from what I'm used to in Japan.   I went to the place for all you can eat lunch deal (which was actually restricted to 10 tiny orders total, but whateva). I don't know about regular menu items, but their portions were ridiculously small (one piece instead of normal two for each nigiri order, and tiny 4 pieces for each maki order). I can see they're trying to pretty-fy (trendy-fy or whatever the words you can come up with) their sushis, but especially makis were easy-to-make cheater dish anyway (which you never see served in a restaurant in Japan), so it's kind of funny they try to make those look \"high class\" by making them ridiculously small.  Another thing I'd never understand (not just this place but all sushi places I've been to in the US) is that they serves those cheap fake crab-flavored fish-meat substitutes as \"crabs\". Really, do they expect anybody actually thinks there's any crab in those things? If you can't afford real crab, why not just skip it from the menu, or at least clarify it being fake on the menu? I've gotten used to this fake advertisements in sushi menus in various places by now, but it's still surprising to see them proudly served in a supposedly posh place like Pisces. My order of \"crab\" nigiri sushi came with a piece of rectangular fake crab meat placed on top of a ball of rice. Do you seriously call this a sushi?  All in all, it was OK. You can find better (and cheaper) sushis even in Charlotte. I won't name names since I don't wanna sound like plugging the places.  On the plus side, the waiters were very cheerful and attentive. All in all, I think it's a nice trendy place to hang out. Just don't expect too much in terms of food or its cost performance.",

    "text": "UPDATE 9/5/2011  Went here again to test out the all-you-can-eat sushi lunch special before grocery shopping at Trader Joes, which, not surprisingly, was a bad idea. First off, their web site says the special runs from 11:30am to 3pm, when in actuality, you have to place your order BY 2:30 and they stop serving you at 3pm. So if you go and want the all-you-can-eat deal, you better get there at 11:30 if you plan on having a leisurely lunch.  That was a bummer, but we gave them a pass since we didn't walk in until 2:50pm. Then, however, we were told they had a deal--half-off bottles of wine. We ordered a bottle, but the server returned to us and told us that the half-off special was only for wine, not for champagne. We'd ordered a prosecco from a section of their wine list labeled \"sparkling wines.\"   I'm married to a sommelier. Prosecco, as it turns out, is actually wine. A sparkling wine. This miscommunication could've been avoided if it had been more clearly defined what the restaurant meant by \"half-price bottles of wine on Mondays,\" but alas, no. After two strikes (and similar experiences here before), we decided to cut our losses and head to Zoe's across the street. It wasn't sushi, but the service was good. Sometimes that's more important.   Unfortunately won't be going here again.    --  I really want to like this restaurant. I really, really do.   Truth be told, the sushi isn't bad -- I would give the XOXO Roll and the Yellow Submarine 5 stars on their own. Those sushi rolls are the only reason for the two-star rating.  Although I've noticed they've cut the portion sizes on some of their items (most noticeably the seaweed salad), the big problem is the service. I've been here four or five times, and at its best the service has been OK. At its worst...terrible. I may not be able to go back there after the last time. We waited for 10 minutes before flagging down the hostess to ask if she could send a server our way, and then before a server even made it to our table, the table next to us was seated, ordered, and was served.   There are too many other places to go in Charlotte to waste my time here.",

First our waitress seated us right in the front of the house in the most awkward place and then refused when we asked to move further back.    I had the spicy tuna roll and the first love roll both sounded promising on the menu, but did not deliver in taste. The spicy tuna was not spicy and was reminiscent of catfood, the first love roll was o.k., but nothing to write home about. Both were DRY, bland, and seemed poor quality.    The price for both rolls was pretty ridiculous (about $10 ea) considering you only get  6 very small pieces of each. Hungry guys would have to order about 5 to get full.  My advice: skip this place and go to RuSans for better sushi and better service.  One star for a pretty interior. Zero stars for service and food.",

    "text": "I looked past all of the tepid reviews and decided to give Pisces a try--if for no reason other than having someplace new to write about--last night.  Bad choice.  I should have listened to all you Yelpers.  Hell, it's why we all Yelp.  I won't make the mistake again, I'll tell you that.    I'd give Pisces 2 1/2 stars because they're not \"A-OK\" to me, but our waitress, Nicole, garnered an extra half star for the restaurant because she was so kind and helpful.  I could give a quarter star for the booths because they make you feel like you're eating sushi in a cave.  That's pretty cool.  The rest of the uber-modern decor made me yawn.  It's becoming so passe.    The food is waaaaay overpriced.  They're charging Nikko prices for Sushi 101 quality.  We chose to order no rolls because they all seem to include cream cheese, something fried, mayo or whatever the hell Screaming O sauce is.  The sashimi certainly wasn't as bad as some strip mall sashimi that I've had, but it certainly wasn't worth the price tag they attached to it.  But here's the reason why I'll never return to Pisces......  We ordered the sushi-sashimi combo, which comes 9 pieces of sashimi, 8 nigiri and a California roll.  California rolls suck, and therefore we did not want to eat the California roll.  We asked to replace the California roll with a spicy salmon roll and be charged the extra dollar that the spicy salmon roll costs.  Makes sense, right?  Not to Pisces ownership, it doesn't.  So...we ordered the combo, minus the California roll (so no food was wasted) and ordered the spicy salmon roll ala carte for $6.  Now here's a word to all you business majors and future restauranteurs from your Uncle Todd:  don't give up future business for something as silly as a simple substitution.  It's a bad business move.  And so I say to you, Pisces ownership:  seriously?  You're willing to lose potential long-term business over something as simple as substituting one simply made roll for another simply made (yet not as tasty) roll?  Silly.  Just silly.",

    "text": "After hearing awesome stories about Pisces from a few of our friends, my boyfriend and I decided to check it out one night before we hit the bars. We came in and immediately commented to each other on the cute atmosphere, even more excited than we were originally. I ignored the hostess' flat tone when she asked us if we'd rather sit at the bar or in the lounge, having worked at a late night restaurant for two years of my life, I figured she was just tired and gave her the benefit of the doubt.  Our server bounded over to the table almost immediately after we sat and asked us if we were ready to order. We explained it was our first time and that we'd be ready to order a couple of drinks and some appetizers soon. When he came back, we ordered beers and he asked to see our ID's. My boyfriend's ID is pretty old and beat up, so we were cool with it when the server said he'd have to ask a manager if he could accept it. He came back a few minutes later and asked my boyfriend what his zodiac sign was. My boyfriend is no astrological guru and accidentally answered with the wrong sign and the server simply narrowed his eyes and said \"I don't know...\" My boyfriend (who also has worked in the restaurant industry) then told him that if he didn't feel comfortable serving him alcohol, it was okay, but that I'd still like my drink and then  we'd be ready to order food. The server said okay and left the table. Ten minutes went by. Fifteen minutes. Twenty minutes later, we saw him - changed into a t-shirt with his backpack on, waving to his coworkers and walking out the door. REALLY? Since when has it ever been okay to leave work when you've still got a table?!  Thankfully the bartender was very cool and took over the table after I went over and explained to him what happened. He was also much more attentive and quicker when we asked him for anything (this is while also waiting on another bigger party and having a full bar of patrons). I don't know if we'll ever be back. It's a shame because the sushi was delicious. I don't remember what we got because I was so annoyed at the nerve of our original server. If we ever do come back, I'll be sure to let the disinterested hostess know we'd like to sit at the bar, NOT the lounge.",

On the all you can eat menu they didn't have any fried options so definitely a little more health conscious than most of the all you can eat sushi places I have been to. I was only in town for a couple days so didn't get to return to the restaurant to try anything other than the sushi, but they have some other meals that looked quite delightful. The restaurant itself was also very nice and in a good part of town that was clean and safe. The service was a tad bit slow, but that was expected given the tremendous deal they have and how many people were in the restaurant. I will definitely be returning to this place to eat when I am back again in Charlotte as this was one of the best places to eat in the area.",

Seriously, you guys won me over right then and there.  My only dings were:  1. I've been on keto for a long time - it's a health/fitness/lifestyle thing - and the sashimi combos come with escolar or other carby selections. I wish you could sub that out.  2. The sashimi combos come with soup and salad, both are kind of carby for us keto zealots that want to remain 5 carbs or below. I'm sure they are also factored in to the price so I wish you could modify that as well.  Other than the two dietary nitpicks, I look forward to a long lasting culinary relationship.",

Same server that's like angry at the world, every time we needed her attention to order something or just even to get more ginger it was like such an inconvenience to her. I don't know if $12 is worth it for good sushi with such slow service and a grumpy server. Yeah back to Rusan's and New Zealand we go!",

The sushi is all made the same - rice on the outside of the roll (Uramaki). They have good appetizers! You literally pay for what you get, everything is decent!",

We were seated immediately but that's about it for our \"fast customer service\" experience. I guess, I should say to be fair they were having their holiday party and serving guests...but me having to flag you down for a refill or napkins is never a win in my book.   We started with the spicy garlic edamame, shrimp and vegetable tempura  and spring rolls. Meh. They were all just fine, nothing that I'd have to order again.    For dinner we ordered the Love Boat it's a good mix of food - perfect for a group to share. It's got tuna, salmon, shrimp, a philly roll, spicy tuna and rainbow roll.   The presentation was beautiful. But everything was just kinda underwhelming. Perhaps I just expected too much based on all the good reviews. Either way,  I'm not saying that I wouldn't come back. Maybe next time I'll try one of the speciality rolls or the hibachi.   Stay tuned.",

When it came time for checks, she split it up asking each individual person what they had (isn't that your job know what we each had?). Terrible service. Won't return.",

It was an ample amount of food. I even had left overs. The entree comes with a ginger salad which is pretty tasty and miso soup which is good for miso soup (I'm not a huge fan). The chicken and shrimp itself was super tasty and seasoned perfectly. It came with some tasty veggies which included broccoli, onions, mushrooms, and zucchini. I would have liked a sweet carrot but honestly didn't noticed they weren't included until well into my lunch. lol. I also had the fried rice which was perfectly cooked and garlicy. I ordered the garlic noodles as an additional side. It was tasty but not needed.   They have an all you can eat sushi special for lunch. I'm preggers so I can't partake right now but please believe I will be back in about 2-4 weeks to give that a try. Lol",

The ambiance was nice, I loved the little cut out booths (see pic) the service was decent.  I would say attentive for sure. We ordered 2-3 rolls at a time.  I have to remember that all you can eat sushi comes with a price. The flavors were there - bu quality and food consistency seemed off. For example, the salmon was not sliced but more like ground salmon??? That was the last roll my husband ate. I loved that you can order soup, salad and rice all for-the all you can eat price ... it was a good experience, but we won't be returning. If you are trying sushi the first time this is not the place to do so. Charolette has so many other sushi bars to explore and with great quality !",

The ambiance of Pisces is noticeable the second you walk in the door.  Despite the fact that its sandwiched in a busy plaza in the heart of Charlotte, the interior feels, calm, clean and quiet.    The service has been top notch the two times I've been there.  I've sat at the bar and ordered drinks.  I've also sat at a table for their lunch.  Each time, my server was the same chill dude, he knew what he was doing, and was very knowledgeable about the sushi and the variety of rolls they offer.  In addition, my order was correct and served in a timely fashion.    The food, in this case, sushi, was excellent.  I've had a few different rolls and they tasted fresh, were full of flavor, and stayed intact.  What else is there to say?  The ONE AND ONLY REASON, I am not giving Pisces 5-STARS is because of its location in the MET and the cluster-fu*k of a parking garage they have over there!  Its sad to say, but I don't go here more often because I'd rather peel off my fingernails than park at the \"trendy\" Met.     Finally, I wouldn't be doing my job as a Yelper, if I didn't mention that Pisces has the BEST ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI DEAL in CHARLOTTE!  You really have to go here to believe the quality and variety of fresh, made to order sushi you can get for one low price (around $12).  Otherwise, I love Pisces, and I will be there sometime soon for lunch - once my fingernails grow back of course...",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to come to Pisces last minute and were surprised that we were able to make a reservation without trouble on Saturday night. It was restaurant week last week and the menu looked incredible. To my delight, every dish on the restaurant week menu was also on the main dining menu. I think when a restaurant tries to create \"features\" for restaurant week, instead of highlighting great dishes from their menu, it's a great disservice to the restaurant and customers who are there to gauge the quality of the restaurant and it's food.  How else would you know if it is worth coming back to a restaurant if you can't even sample the food on their everyday menu!?   Regardless, that was NOT the case at Pisces!! First off, the service was incredible. A girl named, Crystal, I believe was our waitress. We were seated in a place where the AC was blasting and she was really sweet and turned the temperature up slightly so I wouldn't freeze to death! She was very attentive and easy to speak with throughout dinner.   I can't say enough good things about the sushi!!! We ordered the tuna tataki and the A2 appetizers and sushi rolls (the Screaming \"O\", panthers, and the big salmon roll). The Screaming \"O\" was hands down the best roll and the A2 (sashimi tuna) was the best appetizer. But really, pretty much ALL OF the food and wine was great. The fish was fresh and had the right fish to rice ratio with the rolls. There is nothing more disappointing than a place that skimps on the sushi and makes the rolls laden with rice. Needless to say, we will definitely coming back to have sushi and drinks at this wonderful place!!  I have been to Pisces before for cocktails in the evening and it is a great place to bring your friends for drinks.  The decor is modern (on the lounge side) and it is dimly lit, so provides a great ambiance for small groups or a date.",

We called in a to go order and the staff taking the order did not even know the sauces on the menu I was asking about.  I also requested sauce to be on the side but it was globbed on the top.  My girlfriends cucumber rolls were the smallest pieces of sushi I had ever seen, and the same goes for my $3 sashimi yellowfin tuna.  After spending $23 on two rolls we were extremely unsatisfied and ended up grabbing breakfast sandwiches at McDonalds.  I would recommend trying anywhere else. I have had 5x better sushi at cowfish and ginbu for half the price.",

    "text": "It makes me sad that I had a four star experience here before and have to downgrade to a two. I went the other night with a big group and it was just a bad night. I felt like Pisces is now in RuSans league-loud music, bad service and mediocre sushi.   The service was pretty crappy-we had two servers --the regular server who had someone shadowing him and helping out. So you would think double the plasure, double the fun--or whatever, you would think two servers would be more effiicient yes? No. it took forever in all aspects. We ordered our drinks, waited awhile and then after sitting around for 10 minutes after that just looking around and rubbernecking for our servers-they finally took our order. The food came out at different times so one person would get a hot entree dish 10 minutes before another person would get their sushi, then three minutes later another person would get their sushi and so on.   I ordered two rolls and as said before, it was mediocre. The salmon and tuna tasted rubbery and just not as fresh as I've had before at Pisces or even other sushi establishments in Charlotte. If I wasn't getting fresh fish. I hoped to get some kind of flavor enhanced sushi but nope--the sushi I got was Harris Teeter sushi quality- if that. They offer reasonable prices for their sushi but I was expecting more bang for my buck. After they cleared all the plates, we were still there waiting with empty drinks and looks of impatience with our servers really not acknowledging us or asking us if we need anything else.   I thought I was going to dig Pisces after my first time there but sadly, this past experience was a let down.",

    "text": "Definitely a fan of this place and I am mad at myself for not trying it out sooner!  Met a friend for dinner here last night and I tried not to hype myself up too much about it, but I was pleasantly surprised at a nice sushi/bar place in Midtown.  I got there early so it wasn't too busy, grabbed a table and was super surprised at how comfortable the chairs were.  Usually at 'super modern' places the comfort of the furniture is compromised for clean lines, but here my behind was treated to a nice seat and it is catered to make you want to stay longer and order rolls and rolls of sushi ;).  I ordered the house sake which was surprisingly good, and the other sake options on the menu definitely were enticing.  Our server was super nice and we had mentioned that we were both new to Pisces.... he immediately rattled off some recommendations from the menu.  Even had an \"off the menu\" item (a roll they are thinking about adding to the menu in the near future) called a \"Stop, Drop, and Roll\"  My friend ended up ordering that and I had a piece, definitely a nice roll and would stand on it's own if added to the menu.  The Kissy Roll (crab, mango, cream cheese in soy paper wrap) was refreshing... I also ordered the Screaming \"O\" at the recommendation of our server and it did not disappoint (shrimp tempura, cucumbers, aioli sauce, and a nice slice of jalapeno on top of each roll piece).  Overall I had a great sushi impression of this place....  they had a nice sushi bar and regular bar as well with a couple of flat screens.  Good place to wind down after work or catch a game on the tv... while having great sushi.",

    "text": "There are some good sushi places scattered here and there around Charlotte, and this one holds its own.  That said, it's a bit pricey compared to other local sushi spots.  This is understandable given its location in the city.    It's located in the Met so be prepared to deal with parking in the big deck.  If you're unfamiliar with the Met, it's basically an urban strip mall and since it's packed into a relatively small area there are multiple levels and a parking deck rather than big sprawling parking lots.  Ok, so back to Pisces...  We've been here a few times now and have always been happy with the service and the selections.  They have a pretty good variety of rolls to suit different tastes.  My favorites are the Screaming O and the Big Salmon.  They also have a pretty good beer and cocktail list that helps it stand out among some of the other sushi places in town.  The atmosphere is very cool and modern and fits the location well.  There is a dining room side and a bar side that feels more like a club atmosphere.  We were seated at love seats in the bar side one time and it was kind of a weird vibe at first but it ended up being really comfortable once we settled in.  Good sushi, cool atmosphere, definitely worth checking out!",

I always get the Crispy Cali Roll, it is my absolute favorite and hard to find flash fried! The pork dumplings are delicious and the chicken hibachi is pretty good! They have a huge list of sushi rolls and they are generous portions. The service is spotty, sometimes good, sometimes bad. And the atmosphere, although looks trendy, needs some refreshing. The chairs and tables are all torn up, and other small things could make it go from good to great. I do also wish they would serve brown rice, and be able to have your sushi made with it. Overall, we keep returning because the food is great!  Update, they revamped their chairs since the previous fabric was peeling off and sticking to clothes and looked horrible. With the reupholstered chairs, the restaurant looks a little better! The tv on the back wall is still ridiculously crooked though. We also met the manager since we're always in there and he is awesome. Very kind, and makes sure our order comes out correct and that the waitress isn't slacking. We still continue to eat here all the time!",

Biggest complaint was the \"bite\" sized hibachi filet dinner contained pieces that were much more than bite size and even requesting a fork did not help the situation.  Filet Mignon should not be chewy and tough - ordered it med. rare and only a few pieces fit that order.  Garlic noodles which in the past were killer were only fair at best - no garlic flavor even after ordering the noodles with a request for extra garlic.  Dessert was 50/50 - lava cake was scrumptious - chocolate oozing out of center with vanilla ice cream, but the deep fried cheese cake was disappointing.  When you brought the cake up to your nose, the smell of old oil was very prominent - reminded me of \"county fair\" food.  Just could not get past the smell enough to sample more than a bite of the cheese cake.   Interior in need of some upfit - noticed several areas around booths that needed repair.  Wish Pisces had stepped it up for Restaurant Week instead of coasting - that is how it felt.",

We ordered our miso soups, which took a fair bit of time to come out, and we honestly had to wait for about 45 minutes for our sushi to arrive.  We each only ordered 2 rolls and nothing overly complex.  I would really hate to see a sushi order during a peak busy time!  The sushi itself was decent, but for their 'specialty' rolls, I was really sad to see only 6 or 7 pieces, most of the time in a nice sushi bar, the most expensive rolls are around 8 or 9 pieces (for 9 or 10 dollars a roll I don't think that's unreasonable to ask for!)  Overall, not a great experience, but not a terrible one either - the company I was with made this a solid 3 star experience.",

I have never been to the All You Can Eat Buffet, only dinner. I found the Sushi and Sashimi here to be very fresh and very attractively presented so I was shocked to hear other bad reviews. We ordered Sushi Deluxe and Sashimi Deluxe plates.  I also had Uni which was fresh here. Hibachi Chicken was very well flavored with tender pieces of chicken served with fried rice and saute' broccoli and mushroom; Filet Mignon Stacker was cooked perfectly and a tempura roll was also generous portion. For dessert, we had green tea ice cream and Mango mochi both very similar tasting to other Sushi restaurants. I agreed that this place is very pricey.  Dinner for the four of us including 2 drinks were $198.  Our Sushi dinner at Musashi, our other favorite Sushi restaurant, is usually half this price but Musashi does not have a full bar and service is more traditional Japanese and so can be less attentive.",

There are several ways I'd like to describe our experience...  First of all, my husband spent a month in Japan a couple of years ago so he knows authenticity when he sees it.  We were sitting at the bar and he was telling me about one of his favorite dishes from Japan called Okonomiyaki.  As soon as he said \"If I ever find a place that makes it here I'm going to...\" and there it was on the menu!  They have authentic Japanese beers and the House Sake is amazing.  Now let's get to the Sushi...  FRESH, perfectly prepared, so full of flavor, and just plain delicious.  And above all this, every single staff member was superb.  It was my first time in the restaurant and every one I had contact with made me feel like I'd been a regular for years...  The atmosphere is classy and if you get a booth in the back it's even romantic and somewhat secluded which I loved...  Needless to say, I'm now a HUGE FAN of Pisces and will continue to visit as often as possible.",

Hello? It's lunch time. Don't you know some people have a time limit on their lunch break? Nothing spectacular about this place other than it's in a hip location and good for younger crowds on weekends. Decors are nice but I wouldn't wow my friends and families from out of town with their sushi. Go to Rusans, decent priced and way better flavor in their foods.    Last time I was there at Pisces for a friends bday, two of my friends made a mistake and ordered the crab salad thinking it would be something awesome considering the price! When it came out, it was nothing but shredded imitating crab meats (wtf?) mixed with tons and tons of cucumber, so flavorless! Anddddd it tasted like something a kid could make.  They both didn't even want to finish it. Seriously not impressed.",

You have a wide variety of seating options from traditional tables to booths that are extremely private in the back of the room.  Sushi is always prepared fresh and quick to suit your busy schedule.  There are nights every week where they have half off bottles of wine, call ahead to verify the correct date. This is somewhat new to the business.  The dining area is clean and so are the restrooms.  Great for parties and large groups.",

Ora king salmon, is a must have sashimi !!!! It had this buttery texture and it just completely melted in my mouth. The Bluefin toro tartar was , just amazing nothing can describe how tasty it tasted!!!?I order couple of rolls after, I think one of them was call rub my belly, and selfish bastard, really unique names. And the sushi chef did some art on my plates too!!! Definitely coming back!!! For sure!!!! Thank you Pisces for bringing me such a wonderful experience!!!",

I don't normally like sushi, but this place has changed my mind! With vegan and vegetarian and gluten free options, this is the place for everyone! I am so thankful for their wonderful service and food and absolutely will be back. They catered to everyone's dietary needs and answered our questions professionally and enthusiastically. I'm not really into seaweed and they have options for that too ;). Overall a great experience. The parking was also very easy as there's a deck right across the street! Thank you to the wonderful staff and chefs.",

Live music quietly played so we could still maintain a normal conversation.  I love the low-key atmosphere and little quirks this place has.  It definitely makes a perfect date night.  ;)  For the sushi we ordered First Love Roll, Bobcats Roll, and a Screaming \"O\" Roll.  First Love was a more basic roll with mango that did not overpower the roll.  Had a big of a wasabi kick to it.  My favorite was the Bobcats Roll.  It was a more complex roll with a lot of elements to it.  The crab salad topping made this roll.    I only had one piece of the Screaming \"O\" roll and, although it was not as spicy as I expected it to be, it was still a yummy roll.    I will definitely be back here since I loved every second of it.",

The sushi was spectacular, I usually order 3 or more rolls which always costs me $40 so I thought it was awesome that I had the option to get all you can eat sushi for $10. Everything I ate tasted so fresh, my servers name was Andrea and she made my experience so awesome. She knew everything on the menu, any question I asked her she answered without any hesitation. The service was so warm and hospitable. If I ever come back to Charlotte I will be sure to come back and ask for Andrea!",

There are about 12 or so rolls to choose from, and they come in small 4 piece rolls so you can order a bunch of different things. Also available are three kitchen items: fried rice, garlic noodles and egg rolls. And for an additional $5, you get some all you can eat nigiri options.  Don't be a jerk and order a bunch of sushi and just eat the fish out of it. They are more than happy to charge you full price if you waste the food they prepare for you.  Highly recommended, especially for lunch!",

Unassuming from the front, we passed it by for 2 days before going in - after the visit I kicked myself for  not trying sooner.  ATMOSPHERE - Meh...Quiet, subdued even, with black tables and minimal artwork. The tables are close together, so if you're looking for romantic this probably isn't it.  SERVICE - Efficient... we went during lunch time, our server understood we needed to get back to work and served is as quickly as we needed her to. Unlike other \"all you can eat\" places that slow their roll as soon as you have your first helping, this place was literally willing to give us as much as we could bear.  FOOD - Not perhaps the most inventive sushi I've ever had, but fresh, tasty, and plentiful. I did not expect to find enjoyable sushi in Charlotte, let alone in this section of the city, but was pleasantly surprised.  VALUE - ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI for $12 for lunch... you're kidding, right??? Do you KNOW me??  :) - For real, there were two of us, we had probably 50 pieces of sushi all in (more him than me!!), and the total bill with sodas was $34 before tip. Absolutely can't be beat.  If you have a sushi hankering, and have worn your elastic waistband pants, DEFINITELY stop in here.",

Second time around our server was all over and seemed to always miss our table. I'm unsure which is the norm.  For a faster and more casual sit down sushi restaurant, the quality and quantity is great. AYCE is a good deal and it's available every day of the week. I think some of the more negative reviews about the quality are unfair and I believe they may be comparing at an unfair advantage/ level.   Only negative comment that isn't really even that negative.. weird chopsticks. I like to have my own wooden chopsticks and this place has plastic reusable ones. I like to think I'm pretty good with chopsticks but these things make me feel like a noob! Ha! The waitress kindly brought me a to-go wooden pair.",

We had to wait almost an hour for a table, but that's what we get for showing up at noon for the lunch special with an entire office worth of people. It was fine.  Once seated, the service continued to be on the slow side, but the food more than makes up for the lackluster wait staff. They have an expansive sushi menu of classic rolls, but I love the fact that you can also choose from a bunch of delicious, unlimited sides! Especially worth noting are the veggie spring rolls, which are the FIRST I've ever seen that are wrapped in rice paper, making them essentially gluten-free. It's a big deal to people like me who don't want to eat gluten but do NOT want to give up the pleasure of a hot, crispy spring roll every once in a while.  The sushi tastes fresh and is flavorful, the rolls are tiny (4 pieces) but it's unlimited, so order a whole bunch to start with and you'll be good. I always feel a little bit like I'm stealing when I'm so stuffed I can hardly walk and open the bill to see an $11 charge. AMAZING.",

My friend and I wanted to try a few things so we ordered the miso soup, crab dumplings, calamari, and spring rolls as starters. For our entrees we both had sushi rolls. I had the little bastard roll and my friend had the aries roll. All of the food was amazing.   We also ordered the little mini crabs that they sell. They're flash fried and you pop them like potato chips. You eat them whole, shell and all. It was an experience lol. If you're into trying different things you may like them.   This place also offers unlimited sushi lunch specials during the week so I know I'll be back for that. I definitely recommend this place if you're in the area.",

The soft music was an extra added touch bc it wasn't too loud that you couldn't enjoy conversation but it was also very relaxing. They also have a TV in the lounge that they were more than happy to change to the basketball game.  Drinks: Bae had a Tito's and Tonic and I had a mimosa. Definitely no complaints. They do have a few drink specials throughout the week. (FYI - They have a drink on the menu called Cardi B which I think is super cute). Food: Appetizer - Sesame Chicken - it was absolutely delicious. It also comes with honey mustard which was a great added touch. We both enjoyed them.  I had two sushi rolls, with cream cheese, cucumbers, tempura shrimp and crab salad. Bae had chicken and boiled rice. He didn't have any complaints he too enjoyed his meal. Will definitely come back to visit as a go to sushi place this summer!",

I ordered the Hurricane roll and the crunchy spicy tuna roll. My boyfriend ordered the oceans 7 roll and the screaming o roll. It's nothing I would come back for. The service was ok she seemed rushed the whole time even though there was hardly anyone in the restaurant.   We did have to wait for a table even though we called in and asked to make a reservation and were told they were not busy to come in. We got there and while they weren't busy we still had to stand up front while there was plenty of open tables.   We ordered 2 different appetizers, my boyfriend ordered bacon wrapped scallops & they were bland. I ordered the steamed edamame & it looked like the person who prepared the dish dump salt on one piece of edamame and spared the rest. This isn't a bad establishment just not one I would return to if back in Charlotte!",

Despite no longer being on the menu, they were able to whip it up with no problem. My friend wanted Poke, which isn't on the menu, nor has it ever been. However, raw fish is raw fish and they made it happen. It was fresh, tasty, and I was extremely appreciative that this was done without any hassle. Precisely why Pisces remains one of my favorites in Charlotte. They could do with less ice in their cocktails. I understand less ice does not mean more alcohol, but after I take out all of the ice, the glass shouldn't be 1/3 full. Geez. Just make it a shot if that's what we're doing.",

    "text": "atmosphere 3 price 2 food 2/3 service 1 overall for the money and experience probably 1.5/5  Went with a group of people for lunch only a few days after another AYCE sushi place.   This place was worse.   Service  Not the typical AYCE sushi place where you write down a number in front of the item on a piece of paper. Nor the more advanced ones where they just put the order directly into a PDA or tablet on the table.  You're also limited to order 10 items per person which confused the entire group for a bit and had to figure out how many each of us can order. Example, if you order 10 nigiri sushi, that's your order and not like 10 different kinds of dishes.   Waitress is either new or stressed. It was relatively busy around 1330 on a week day. ---   Food for pricing. Typical quality for $-$$ price range.  Not suprisingly, no sashimi on the menu for AYCE, even with additional price. BUT, it costs extra to order nigiri sushi! What?!  The AYCE menu have tiers, basic tier is just rolls and appetizers. Have to pay extra for nigiri sushi (and you can't just get nigiri, have to pay the basic tier first)  Ohh, miso soup is extra and on it's own add-on tier! What?! Never have I ever seen this at an AYCE sushi place in multiple states and countries.   So yea, I don't recommend this place at all and never going back again.  ---  Something positive about the food... a few of their maki rolls were pretty tasty but doesn't stand out from other sushi places at all.",

They weren't busy at all. Maybe 2 tables including us. We waited a while to be greeted. When we were finally greeted and we told her our drink order and that took a very long time to get our drinks.   We ordered the calamari and each a sushi roll. The calamari was good but very salty. I got the bastard roll and it was good but you can tell the avocado was not fresh. It was super mushy and slightly slimey. My friend liked her roll.   Overall, this place is just ok. Nothing super impressive about it and a little overrated. Service could have definitely improved especially with hardly anyone in there.",

The face a good selection of specialty rolls on the all you can eat lunch special my favorite is the spicy crab salad or the bagel roll which is salmon and cream cheese.  Today we also had a tuna roll that tasted as if it was caught this morning. There sushi always taste very fresh and the spring rolls are fried to perfection and are always nice and crispy!  That atmosphere is very nice  make sure you check out the jelly fish tank! The drinks have great names also we had the Cardi B wich was their take on a Moscow mule.

We got a bottle of wine 1/2 off and it was 1/2 off sushi rills until 6 which is why we went. Every roll we had was fantastic. Our waitress, Kaitlin, was awesome very friendly. She actually helped us order and sat and  talked. Somehow, we got on the subject of our son, and the next thing you know she brought out a fried Oreo and vanilla ice cream desert that was..hmmm good.

The food was great, we all got sushi and it was all amazing. We also got hibachi chicken, there was a lot of chicken which was surprising; but it was good! And another member of the group also got the duck, and he absolutely loved it. We also had crab dumplings and those were great, the sauce that comes with those was unlike any I'd had with crab dumplings/Rangoon before! For me and my boyfriend our total before tip was about 65. We got two sushi rolls, hibachi chicken, crab dumplings, and two beers (maybe three?). The other two that were with us got two sushi rolls each, split a bottle of saki, one got the duck, and one got a handful of sashimi, their totals were about $50-55 each. I love this area and this restaurant is definitely on the list of places to go back to!",

Saw one where someone said it gave them food poisoning. Like an idiot, we ignored this. BIGGEST MISTAKE! My husband got a bacterial infection from the sushi. 24 hours after eating here he started getting terrible stomach pains and diarrhea. Next day add on a fever and dehydration. The following day we're told we need to go to the ER. They put him on an IV drip to get his vitals back up because he was so dehydrated and had a 103 temp. A CT scan shows inflamed intestines. Between the ER trip and meds and everything, our sushi lunch cost us over $400! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!",

Easily one of the best places to eat at The Met and happy to say that they have some of the better sushi in town for the price. Also, with the $14 all-you-can-eat sushi during the week, it's a solid joint for lunch, too.   Recently came in for dinner with the Mrs and we enjoyed our time heartily.   Tempura Veg - Stellar Cali Roll - Textbook Spicy Tuna Roll - Perfect Screaming \"O\" Roll - Not my favorite, but I had heard quite a bit about it and had to try it. There happened to be a minute amount of wasabi lurking somewhere within, so I wasn't too keen on the flavor. Other than that, great stuff.  Cocktails - The Fresh Fruit Gin Fizz and Pocket Fours are both wonderful. Nothing fancy, just served in a pint glass with tons of freshness. Not too boozy either. I'd order both again in a heartbeat.   The service was great as well. Our server was nice and to the point. Not too much nonsense or over-communication, which I appreciate.   Pisces is a great choice for sushi and cocktails. Also, never had the chance to witness him in his element behind the bar, but I know Bob Peters slings a mighty fine beverage.",

Our waitress Heather was extremely knowledgable about the menu and gave us great sushi recommendations, in addition to the pork belly buns that were delicious. The drinks were mixed well and the overall presentation of everything was beautiful.  Did I mention that the owner came to our table to talk us and get to know us personally?

During the week they offer an all-you-can-eat lunch menu that includes some of their popular sushi rolls and other menu items for $14. (I enjoyed it even more when it was only $12).  The atmosphere is very quaint and charming. It's both trendy and welcoming. The staff is also very friendly.   Regarding the sushi, the rolls are quite good. It's not the best sushi in the area, but it's very enjoyable. It's hard to describe; the rolls are fresh, but they aren't very refined. With that said, I always enjoy my meal. I've even brought out-of-town guests here.   Regarding the appetizers, I love their edamame which is served hot (like I like it). I also really enjoy their vegetable spring rolls. The calamari, however, wasn't very good. It was a little chewy.  My favorite side is the garlic noodles. Delicious!!!   Overall, this is a solid spot. It should definitely be added to your sushi rotation.",

Noticed that the place seemed darker (darkly lit?), but everything seemed about the same as before. Casual, yet City Chic.  Tried 2 of their Sushi/Maki Rolls, \"Crunchy Spicy Tuna\" and \"Spider\"...and well, they were good, but not exceptional. Unlike on my previous occasions there, the presentation was weak. They used to really fancy up the rolls...but not sure what happened tonight? I also think they might have given me the \"Jumangi\" instead of the \"Spider\" Roll...but I could be wrong. In all, a bit of a let-down on my Rolls.  Still, I absolutely love their menu (though their drinks are way too expensive)...and never had bad service there. I also love their Happy Hour and lunch specials.  Am definitely coming back to try more items on the menu. Just hope they amp up the presentation a bit more next time.",

    "text": "My husband and I have really enjoyed Pisces in the past, and I most likely would've left a four-star review. Now I don't know if we'll return. Today at lunch, the hostess completely ignored the pair of us after we'd been standing there for five minutes, only to immediately greet another couple as soon as they walked in. I understand that it's a popular, busy place and time, which is why we didn't mind standing there for five minutes. We had just moved to the front of the line. If the hostess had bothered to look up after sending the people in front of us off with their server, she would've been looking right at me. It's almost as though my husband and I were both invisible. We walked out. The sushi is good and it's a great lunch special, but the service has never been particularly friendly and this is just not worth it.",

    "text": "Our first visit to Pisces was on Friday night for a birthday celebration.  Pisces happened to be participating in Restaurant Week, which was a nice surprise.  We had 7 pm reservations and were promptly seated when we arrived.    Parking is available in the parking deck, just be sure to go up a couple of floors in the parking deck.  If you happen to score a parking space on the first floor of the deck, be sure to buy yourself a lottery ticket too because it truly is your lucky day!   The restaurant itself is very modern, fun and upbeat!  We found all of the staff to be very welcoming.   On to the food! We decided to take advantage of their restaurant week menu.  For $30 you got a choice of a glass of wine, draft beer or a coke product, an appetizer, for the entree: either 2 sushi rolls or 1 hibachi option. I had the Crab Dumplings as my appetizer, and chose two rolls of sushi for my entree: Eel the Love and the Filet M Roll.    The Crab Dumplings were plentiful for an appetizer and very tasty.  Freshly made, you could actually taste the crab! The Sushi was not only beautiful, it was delicious!  An order of Brussel Sprouts was ordered for the table (I normally dislike BS) but these were absolutely amazing and addicting!  Do yourself a favor and be sure to order this when you come!  We also ordered 2 orders of Tempura Oreos as our dessert, one with green tea ice cream and a other one with vanilla ice cream.  I preferred the vanilla ice cream option.   Overall a great visit Pisces and I plan to come back and check more of their menu out!",

The restaurant has a welcoming vibe and can accommodate parties have all sizes. They have a broad menu making it easy for  everyone to find something they like however they have only one roll on the entire menu that is gluten free so that was disappointing for someone with a severe gluten allergy. Decent quality fish for the nigiri and sashimi and the brussel sprouts were a huge hit. Overall a good experience but would love some more gluten free options!",

Well, the sushi on the lunch special are just ok. Also, though the menu is nice size, it all taste similar. I have had great sushi, their sushi is just ok. So, it pains me to give such a cool place with a great value a 3 star rating, but like I said the similar taste of all the choices and the lack of wow factor in the food, warrants this score. Check it out if you want a cool place to go around lunch time, but you won't be wowed.",

The sushi is basic, but there are about 20 options to choose from. Be very careful though, if you don't finish what you order, you have to pay for it! Each sushi option comes with 4 pieces, so choose wisely.   Bathrooms are gender neutral/shared in the back room side, not sure about the main dining area.   Parking is easy in the Trader Joes/Best Buy garage. If you have to park up a couple of floors, there is a staircase that leads down to the street across from the entrance to Pieces.  Pro tip: ask for spicy mayo and add it to everything!",

They had great selection for sushi, when came last night it very limited it was pretty the same sushi over again expert the fish was different.

A bit of a Blade Runner vibe for you fellow nerds out there.  But let's talk food and service, both of which absolutely kick ass.  Heather is a stellar bartender and sushi expert. Given my sparse descriptions, she was able to come up with recommendations that knocked it out of the park. Try the Silk In Rye cocktail, it's weirdly delicious.  I had the Hamachi Carpaccio and the Wagyu Nigiri. Both of which were absolutely top notch. Take note that the wagyu nigiri is a total foodie dish, and you get a tiny portion for the price. If you're like me though, money is no substitute for happy taste buds. And yours will be super happy.  Come for the sushi and great cocktails, be late to your next engagement because the service is stellar and they take wonderful care of you.  Added Bonus: was surprisingly not busy for a Friday night. It's not the norm I'm told, but if you're sick of waiting for RuSans, this is the perfect alternative!  The Manager Crystal runs a tight ship with no leaks, your money is well spent here.

She then explained that she credited the additional amount and that my account would show pending for the wrong amount and would post for the correct amount. Well that did not happen. When I called back a week later I was told by a non manager that an employee should never advise anything about how transactions post as it's up to the bank and also advised that the person who told me that is a manager. Well the manager had the vendor who processes their transactions return my call instead of her...unbelieveable ! expected better customer service after you accidentally made a mistake ...",

    "text": "Went here for all you can eat sushi when Dressler's was closed. You're supposed to eat all your rolls, which I understand. Beware, don't order rice because they make you eat a big bowl of fried rice that has maybe one pea in it, with no eggs or pay full price. I have a few problems with this: 1. The fried rice was horrible. 2. I would never pay for a bowl of fried rice that bad! 3. I would rather get a 13 dollar roll of the regular menu and eat it all than eat any of their rolls on the all you can eat menu. Unless their regular menu is just as bad. 4. Their all you can eat rolls are sorry. Really pathetic for a sushi role. I've been to many all you can eat sushi places that were way way better. If you can't afford to make a decent all you can eat, then don't have an all you can eat!!!!! It was honestly an all you can eat crappy fried rice bowl rather than an all you can eat sushi. Cocktails were good, hence the one star.",

    "text": "This was our second time visiting Pisces and I have to say it was so much better this time! I'm not sure if my last visit was just a bad night for them or if what I ordered this time around was just a better choice,but it was pretty awesome.  Our server Alex was knowledgable and very attentive. I will say that they move really fast (which can be great if you have to be in and out quickly)but for people who, like myself, prefer to wait between appetizer and entree and really have a chance to talk with my guest and mull over the menu, it's kind of rushed. The menu is very detailed, so extra time is needed to see it all.  What we chose- The lil bastard roll, a shrimp tempura and avocado roll topped with a crab salad and crunchy bits of onion. It's a very generously sized roll and had great flavor.   We also got the crispy spicy tuna which may be one of my new favorite sushi rolls. Spicy tuna flash fried in tempura batter- mine was perfect and not cooked all the way through, so the tuna had great flavor and texture.  Our very favorite was our appetizer- cucumber salad. It had raw tuna, avocado and of course cucumber in a light Asian dressing. Could have eaten it all night! Everything was very fresh and delicious! Overall we really enjoyed our quick trip to Pisces!",

    "text": "The word pisces comes from a Latin word meaning fishes. And it's also one of the zodiac signs - shaped like a fish.   Pisces Sushi Bar & Lounge has lots of jelly fishes in a tank. The interesting thing is that these jelly fishes shrink as they age and by the time they die, they're almost unrecognizable with naked eyes. Fortunately, these wonderful folks at Pisces will get new jellies once they all die out, which takes only a few months. I had no idea they only live for a few months.  Anyway, let's talk about their food and service. The people who work there are really nice and friendly. I asked a bunch of questions about their food, and stared at their jelly fish for some time, and they were totally fine with it. In fact, they came up to me and just sharing all these wonderful information about the amazing creatures that we call jelly fish!  Seriously though, there's a lot more going on there than just the jelly fish tank. Their miso soup is really good. I mean authentic northeast Asian, made-for-cold-winters, proper doenjang, miso. I went there not knowing they had extended their restaurant week menu so I got to try their gyoza and loco moco for $30. And they were both on point. Gyozas are supposed to be thin, a bit chewy, with marinaded meat inside. Those warm apps all passed the test. Loco moco was alright too. Their large, moist, and chewy rice hit home hard. Be careful though. It's really hot.  Oh, the place looks really small from outside but they have more tables hidden inside on both sides of the restaurant so be bold and open that door for your East Asian culinary experience.",

The lunch special rolls are indeed small with only 4 pieces, as the previous review noted, so you may have to order more to fill you up. The eel hand roll was delicious and not overly drenched with unagi sauce like so many restaurants like to do. They do a great job with the sushi rice, which combined with fresh ingredients and clean preparations left me very pleased with the meal. It is a good place to dine alone for a business dinner either at a table or at the small bar. Very reasonable for a casual dinner in a nice environment. Parking is easy.",

    "text": "Are you looking for the best sushi in Charlotte with the best service, a fantastic drink list, extremely reasonable prices and also a fantastic ambiance?! Look no further than Pisces Sushi Bar and Lounge. This place is truly amazing after two delightful visits.  On our first visit, we had a reservation and were seating immediately near the sushi bar. Our server was prompt and could answer all of our questions. The appetizers were incredible. I highly recommend the crab dumplings, that are basically just crab rangoons, and the fried eggplant, which is soft, succulent and amazing. The sushi selection is great and VERY reasonably priced. They even have an amazing selection of veggie sushi for the less adventurous (me). The asparagus and avocado are particularly delish. The cocktails are also amazing. The Kiwi something-or-other was so good I had two (thank goodness for designated drivers)!  On our second visit, we took friends from out of town to show off how fancy Charlotte is. I hoped that our second visit would be as good as the first and boy oh boy! was it ever! When we arrived, without  a reservation (tsk tsk), a group of about 6 people were leaving because they were told the wait was an hour and a half. We didn't have a backup plan, so we decided to wait it out. After getting a drink and standing at the bar for about 25 minutes, we were seated! The hostesses kept us posted on what was going on all the while and were just delightful. We were seated along the wall VERY close to the tables next to us. This turned out to be fortuitous as they recommended a few things we loved and were fun and friendly! Again, the sushi was fresh and delicious and our server was wonderful and tolerated out excitement.   While this is already a lengthy post, I would like to note my favorite thing about Pisces: the size of the sushi. One of the things that really puts me off about sushi is how gosh-darn big it is! I can hardly chew it all in one bite! Pisces sushi is of manageable size, but it seems like you get more pieces than you normally would to make up for the skinnier rolls. I guess some people might find this to be a flaw, but it's the reason I will keep going back.  Now, stop reading this incredibly lengthy review and get to chowing on some delicious sushi!",

    "text": "Pisces is one of the newer sushi additions to the saturated sushi market. Since there are so many suzuki restaurants ithin 2 miles, it really needed to add something different and special. I would give Pisces 3.5 stars.  Pisces was the last restaurant I visited in Metropolitan so I expected a grand up fit like Vivace. Other than the cool \"cubbyhole\" booths for larger parties (6?) I was not a fan of the layout. We ate at a table for 2 along the back wall but really had dinner with the 2 couples on either side of us since we were all lined up and so close. One couple was having an awkward first or second date, and I thought I left those behind when I got married, but it all came back so vividly.  I did like the stones inset in the sushi bar. The good news is I would be comfortable going in dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, whereas I might not at Nikko's or Enso.  The food wasn't quite as expensive as we thought it might be. The menu isn't gigantic but had a couple interesting rolls. We especially liked the XOXO roll.  Their miso soup is really really good.  They have a fun drink list (I dig the cucumber martini) that's worth exploring.  Our other neighbors (not on a first date) ordered the Love Boat which was $50 but was HUGE and very fun and festive and they enjoyed it. That said, it was way too much sushi for 2 people, so get it for a group.  I am happy to report that the service was excellent.    Bottom line: good reliable place to get sushi in the neighborhood. Not a standout, but no major complaints. I will try the all you can eat buffet.",

Ok fine, next time I'll go to the bar and get a few drinks first, and close the check then get a table.    The real issue was the price for beer stated 275 for domestics, yet when they brought the check, she had charged me 4 each.  Her explanation was that it was a premium beer (Flat Tire) so had to charge the import price, and that it was listed on the menu wrong.  We were late for an event, so even though the menu had it plainly listed as 275, right next to the name of the beer.  She wouldn't go have it fixed, so I left it up to her to get the difference, and to consider it her tip.  Going there again soon, and not leaving until they fix the menu, or charge me the stated price this time.",

The interior is modern, but more casual (and a bit smaller) than I anticipated. Regardless, we were seated right away and greeted within minutes. Our server was quite friendly and offered a few roll suggestions when asked. The sushi menu is pretty extensive, but at least half of the rolls have either cream cheese or some fried element in them. Not my favorite types - I prefer fresh fish and spices to cream cheese and fried goodness. At least in my sushi.   Soy paper is available for $1, which is a nice addition for those who aren't seaweed fans. Hubs and I tried just two rolls, the First Love - crab, avocado, shrimp, mango, and the Rainbow Roll - California roll with assorted fresh fish on top. Both rolls were well-made and the fish was supremely fresh. Overall, the rolls are priced fairly all around.   I read about the $9 All You Can Eat sushi lunch buffet and I'd definitely like to check that out when my tummy's a-rumblin'.",

And it wasn't just me - every person at our table had the same problem! Then, on top of that, either my little \"bowl\" for soy sauce was dirty, or something weird came out of the soy sauce itself, but it was not fit for eating and I had to use the big saucer instead - haha, I am sure I looked ridiculous, but whatever! When the waitress noticed, she was very nice about it and told me I should have told her so she could get me another small \"bowl.\" She's right, but I didn't make a big deal about it (because honestly it's not a big deal) and I was ok using my big saucer.

Brian, one of the owners, was awesome and worked with us to create a menu that we loved. We rented out the private room and had our own private bar and bathroom. The staff was great - everyone was super helpful. And the best part? We got raving reviews from all of our friends and family! Would definitely recommend to anyone for a great date night spot or even a private event!",

We got there after 10 PM on a Saturday so there was a good size crowd, but we were acknowledged quickly and seated immediately. Our waiter was very nice and pointed out her favorites on the very extensive menu. I had the Bobcats roll which was very nice. The combination of the tempura crunchiness with the crab and shrimp was great with the eel mayo sauce.   The hubs had a caterpillar roll that I sampled and that also tasted good. B/c we were heading to a club later, we had some house sake that put me on my butt! That bad boy was strong, but drinkable and left me in a nice vibe for Whiskey River.   All in all, I enjoyed Pisces and will definitely go back and try some dessert. Only downer was compared to other sushi spots, our food took too long.",

We were the fist customers since we got there around 11:30am right when they opened. They gave us a one sheet menu and the waitress said that the all you can eat sushi applied to the top portion of the menu. It included about two dozen different types of rolls, nigiri and some kitchen items like garlic noodles, fried rice and spring rolls.   We ordered about six different rolls.  The rolls are pretty small you get about four pieces per roll. They bring it to your table on a large platter so that you'll share amongst yourselves.  The sushi was very fresh and delicious.  We also ordered the spring rolls and garlic noodles which were both excellent.    Overall I really enjoyed lunch and our waitress was very helpful in offering suggestions. For under $15 for a nice lunch including tip it was a nice treat. We will be back for sure!    One thing to keep in mind... don't order too much because they will charge you additional if you leave a lot of leftover sushi on your plate. The waitress informed us of this before we even ordered.",

It's very dark in the restaurant, but the decor is nice. It exudes a kind of clubby vibe.  Our server was on it. She totally knew what she was doing. We didn't have to wait for anything, which was great -- especially for our larger group.  I had a mixed drink and a prosecco. For food, I ordered vegetable, pan-fried gyoza, seaweed salad, an avocado roll, and a crab stick roll. I liked everything, but I didn't love it. The gyoza was the best thing. I was glad to have a vegetarian option, as I'm trying to limit my intake of mammals at this time. The seaweed salad was fine. I prefer Yama's. I did not care for the sushi rolls. These had way too much rice. I felt like I was just eating a wad of rice with a crumb of avocado and/or crab stick. It didn't have much flavor. I've never seen this type of roll with rice on the outside and the inside. It was supposed to be maki (seaweed | rice | filling).  Anyway, we had a nice time overall, and that was what really mattered that night. I wish we could give half points on Yelp! This was more of a 3.5.",

    "text": "After dealing with the parking purgatory that makes up parking at the Metropolitan, I was primed to have an unpleasant experience at Pisces. However, after the quick seating and explanation of the made-to-order lunch, I was happily satisfied!  First off, let it be known that to call this sushi lunch a \"buffet\" is a misnomer. While many buffets conjurer up visions of dueling tongs among heated troughs, every item on the lunch buffet is made to order. For $12. That is ridiculousness.    Not only does this result in freshly made sushi, noodles, and spring rolls, but it also saves you the precious calories of having to walk to a buffet line--they bring the food to you. Each person can order 10 items at any given time, but you may have to pay for any wasted food, so do try to contain yourself.  So, what are some of the top picks?  - The garlic noodles are simple in their amazing: imagine those thick chow mien noodles lightly fried with garlic. It sounds good, but tastes even better.   - The spring rolls: holy cow, these are fired to flaky perfection and served with a sweat and spicy dipping sauce. What is not to like?  - Fried rice: I am a sucker for cuttings of veggies, egg, and rice fried with soy sauce. Just be careful not to fill up on the carbs. Hold out for the main course!  - Frankly, all of the copious rolls that I had were delicious. The best part is that they do NOT pad the roll with lots of rice to trick your stomach into being full. A thin respectable layer of rice and seaweed is the only think between you and your filling of choice.   - While I love that they have multiple veggie options: asparagus, avocado, cucumber, and tamago (egg), they are in need of a One Veggie Roll. One Roll to bring them all together and in the seaweed bind them (LoTR? Anyone?).   - The non-veggie rolls are also solid, ranging from the spicy, the cream cheesed, and the fried. I don't tend to eat fish, but I did (secretly) enjoy my bagel roll!  Bottom line, if you are jonesing for a LOT of freshly-made sushi, come here for lunch!",

It's very light and filling- not greasy or heavily slathered in soy sauce. The sushi on the other hand was downright terrible. It mainly consists of rice versus meat. It also wasn't fresh. It tasted like those grab and go sushi trays from bookstores and gas stations (trust me, been there tried that).   I'm always down for sushi at a reasonable price but if you are more adventurous than eating California rolls and shrimp tempura go elsewhere and spend the extra $.",

Another-nother note: If you've only had their sushi buffet, you haven't had the full and real sushi experience.

    "text": "Please read if you're planning on going. It ends with food poisoning.   Me and my boyfriend have been reading fantastic reviews about this place, so we finally decided to try it for lunch today. Upon first walking in, the two girls waiting to seat people, (yes, two people, ten minutes after they opened, on a Sunday, to SEAT people) had sour looks on their faces, and acted like it was an inconvenience to even seat us. With only three couples in the obnoxiously trying to be fancy 'dining' part of the weird bar/sushi theme they have going, obviously trying to make believe they were in Manhattan, they sat us at a table a foot away from another couple, instead of the other 10 empty seats not directly next to someone. It seemed weird, the girls were rude, but we let it slide. The waitress came over, had the same sour look on her face, and took our order. We ordered off the all you can eat sushi menu, since that was the only menu we were given. We ordered one of every appetizer (there were 5), and I got the sweet potato roll and two avocado rolls. My boyfriend got a california roll and a shrimp tempura roll. The 'appetizers' we got were probably the best part. One was noodles in soy sauce. One was a ball of rice. One was a spring roll that tasted like it came straight out of a cheap Chinese take out place, one was pork gyoza (i didn't eat this, but my boyfriend said it was so so), and last but not least, 'fried wontons' which was really just those little strip Chinese take outs gives you on the side of your soup, with a side of Chinese take out sauce to dip in. Whatever, we ignored it, it's only $11 for the all you can eat each and the garlic noodles weren't bad. Then the horrid thing they call sushi came out. They looked like they had been cut in half and smashed. The sweet potato roll was literally just baked sweet potato chunks wrapped in rice. I don't know if any of you have ever had sweet potato rolls, but the sweet potato part is always tempura, and it is always drizzled in a dark brown sauce. Whether you are in Pennsylvania, NYC, Charlotte, or California, that is how a roll is. That was terrible as is. Then the avocado rolls, which was 1/7th avocado, 6/7th rice.   Then to my boyfriends. The Shrimp was cold in the middle, fried on the outside, and the crap tasted like fake canned crab.   We finished what was in front of us and immediately asked for the check. Our stomachs were still growling because it all was such small portions, and we hadn't eaten yet for the day, but there was not a chance in hell we were eating another bite of this nonsense.   We didn't eat again, because even though we were hungry, we felt sick to our stomachs over just that small amount. The food was coming up for the rest of the day, and we both weren't able to eat again. My boyfriend, having eaten the shrimp and crab, got food poisoning.   I would sooner eat 7/11 sushi over this place ever again. This place is not even worth the $11. If you want ACTUALLY good sushi, go to harris teeter, get the sushi from there (which is whole heartedly 15x better) and sit in the dining area. You'll have a much more pleasant experience.",

Hibachi is good, a little bland but, they give you a decent amount of chicken (maybe too much) but it's good for the $16 price tag.  Con: it always smells like a musty bathroom to me in there.. it always seems to be as I'm leaving too.  The \"Lounge\" area is nice to sit at, however, if you're there for a meal and they sit you at the couch, it's not very comfortable to eat.. so ask to be reseated.",

You can add $5 to your bill for nigiri, but otherwise you get a selection of 10 or so different kinds of rolls.  Rice, seaweed, and filling, very standard.  Nothing too special, but still good.  Buffet appetizers are garlic lo mein, spring rolls, and fried rice.  You can order other offerings, like special rolls, gyoza, and hibachi outside of the buffet deal.  The service was good, no complaints.  The ambiance is nice, what you'd expect out of uptown Charlotte.  All in all, the reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 like the other reviews I've given is because the buffet has fewer offerings, and isn't quite as good.  It's still definitely worth a lunch out every now and then.  $10 is a great deal.",

I got to check the place out on my birthday (March 5th for any inquiring minds) and was so happy with my dinner experience.  Pisces is right across the shopping center containing Marshall's Best Buy and Trader Joe's so you'll have to deal with the gnarly parking garage. I suggest driving up to a higher level, less congestion and speed racers.  The night of my birthday was half-price cocktails (*praise hands emoji*) so I ordered a martini that had pomegranate in it. Forgive me, I completely forget the official name of the drink but it was delicious and smooth. My best friend ordered the cucumber sake martini that was also delicious with a nice cucumber finish.  I ordered the taurus veg and panthers rolls. Not only were they both colorful and pretty to look at, they were so fresh and delicious. No joke, I inhaled both rolls.  The waitstaff was incredibly patient and kind. The manager even came by to check in our meal and wished me a happy birthday! The interior is smaller than I was expecting but creates a nice intimate feel and there is a funky jellyfish tank that you can stare at for hours.

I placed my first all you can eat order and waited....and waited...and waited....after 20 minutes, I finally received my first roll. It was actually fairly tasty, but certainly not what I would call high quality sushi. I ordered my second roll and had to wait another 20 minutes. After three rolls (the third took 30 minutes to prepare), I was tired of waiting and just paid and left.  Claiming to offer all you can eat and then forcing customers to wait for unreasonably long times in between orders irks me. Either offer all you can eat or don't.",

I have been sick all week and I couldn't understand why when my husband (and baby unfortunately) also ate from this place. I, however ordered an extra sushi roll. I won't lie, the food was good at the time I had salmon rolls and a hibachi type of blend where they gave an excess of chicken. But for what I've been through in this last week and now to find out others have gotten food poisoning from this place.. I felt the need to warn others.. just Incase.",

Upon the suggestion of other yelpers we started with the brussel sprouts. Do not not get these. They melt in your mouth. I am pretty sure all of the nutritional qualities of brussel spouts are voided but that's fine. Well worth it.   It was hard to narrow down a couple of rolls because everything looked amazing. I love mango in sushi so we got a slammin salmon and we also got a k-pop because fried jalapeno. Both were amazing! Some of the best tasting sushi I have had, you just dont get a lot for the money since they don't do bogo. I am definitely interested in hitting up the all you can eat sushi for lunch one Friday.",

Sometimes that is what you want not the fancy concoctions. The fish seemed good but the rolls were super bland tasting. Rice had no flavor, zero seasoning on anything. And the spicy mayo was just mayo. Will try again but may stick with non-Sushi items.",

That being said I wouldn't order it again. It was just okay 3/5  Smoking Hot Stepmom: If you like spicy drinks you should definitely try this! It had muddled jalapeno and I loved it.   Wassup B: This drink is very yummy and the coolest part is that it is topped with wasabi foam. If you order it, prepare your upper lip to get a little tingly. 4/5  I would definitely come back here.

Then again we are only paying 11 for AYCE sushi so I guess that's why there's more rice than stuffing. We are two rounds, the AYCE rolls are very basic rolls but again, not gonna complain for the price. It was okay over all.   Kitchen items, do not get garlic noodles... very disappointing. Don't get the dumplings, also disappointing.  Sure it was too dumplings and I could smell that pork odor, maybe because it was in the freezer too long or because they left it out to thaw a little bit too long before frying it.  Do get, the spring rolls, that's really good, probably the best thing on kitchen items.   Ambience feels nice, the location is also nice. Love it when I'm in the area. Just traffic is kind of scary.

    "text": "Pisces is quickly becoming a go-to for sushi in Charlotte. I went once for their all-you-can-eat lunch, and then again last night for dinner. Both times I thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience! Lunch was super busy, but thankfully we were seated in a cute little pod/booth off to the right of the main dining room that was much calmer. The waitress was quick, efficient, and accurate- which speaks volumes because the place was packed and orders were coming in left and right. The rolls for AYCE lunch come in half sizes and are simpler than the regular menu, but they have a nice variety to pick from- my fave was the spicy salmon roll. We also ordered spring rolls, which were tasty, and pork gyoza dumplings, which I loved. The fried rice was okay, but I preferred to save room for sushi :) A tip for lunch: order double rolls and pick maybe 3-4 at a time. They go pretty quickly and it'll prevent you from having to make a bunch of smaller orders. Dinner was really different- the restaurant was much quieter and we were seated in the main dining area. We ordered seven rolls- the XOXO, the Panther, the Spider, the Spicy Tuna, a bagel roll, a California roll, and Like A Vegan. Everything was so fresh and tasty. My favorite was probably the Spicy Tuna, but they were all delicious. I had a cosmo and my date ordered a LIT. They make all their drinks from scratch and my cocktail was head and shoulders above any other cosmo I've had. Usually the cranberry is too overpowering. He was satisfied with his LIT as well. I'd totally come back here for either a casual lunch or cute date night!",

    "text": "**Gem Alert**  I am loving Charlotte!  Basically because of places like this located in sweet ol' Midtown.  I went here with a Groupon coupon just expecting to get a good deal for my money.  I left with some much more.  This is exactly what I want for every one of my future restaurant experiences.  Walking in, the entire set up is uniquely designed to subtly stand out.  The booths are romantically secluded out of sight and everything else just screams modern.  From the chairs to the dishes, this place has its own style.    We ordered our drinks from the cocktail menu and I had to start with the cucumber refresher (see pic).  Wow!  Half way through it I had to go up to the bar to have a word with the bartender.  Brian.. is the man!  He took care of us the rest of the meal.  He to our table and asked us what we liked, listened,  and customized our drinks perfectly to sublime satisfaction.  That is superior service.  Thanks Brian!  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about all of the sushi and we went to TOWN.  We got everything... trust me, you cant go wrong.    Then we somehow found room for some dessert.  I struck gold with the fried cheesecake (see pic) and the Wife got the lava cake (see pic).  I wanted to give this place 4 stars because things were a bit pricey but then we had dessert.  I felt so satisfied with spending big money here and would gladly be depositing more very soon.  If you have to, go out of your way and stop by this spot for a great meal.  Best sushi for me was the Metro roll.  Oh yeah!   Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

It came with the usual wasabi and pickled ginger, and a few packets of Kikoman soy sauce (yuck).  I'll give it another try another day, maybe order something a little more complex. I won't be standing in line though, thats for sure.",

    "text": "I went to Pisces last Friday night with a friend of mine.  Street parking is pretty limited around the area, so I just parked on the 2nd floor of the parking deck next to Trader Joe's.  Because it was Friday around 7:00, I was afraid it would be crowded.  Fortunately for us, it wasn't.    We walked in and were immediately greeted and seated.  We followed the hostess through the dining room.  I liked the modern decor in the open restaurant.  Suddenly, we turned OUT of the dining room and down this corridor, which I wasn't expecting.  There were intimate booths down either side.  You entered the booth through this large round opening, which provided additional privacy.  \"I wonder what kind of dirty stuff goes on back here?\" my friend asked.  It provided a nice quiet, intimate environment for a romantic dinner or conversation.    Pisces had a special on a Cucumber Sake Martini that night, so we both decided to try it.  Wow.  It was amazing.  So refreshing, and it went down easily.    To start, I had their house salad with ginger dressing.  Mmm...  You can't go wrong with ginger dressing.  It really feels right before sushi.    I finished off the experience with a Hawaiian Poki roll and a Crunchy Spicy Tuna roll.  Both were delicious, fresh-tasting, and beautifully presented on the plate.  The prices are a reasonable, but by the time I was done with dinner and drinks, I think I spent $40 on myself alone.  Oh well...it was worth it.    The service was great, too.  Our server kept checking in on us.  After we finished, we wanted to talk longer and catch up; our server didn't hound us to leave.  She got a great tip, so no worries. :)   When we finally left around 9:00, the place had really picked up in the main dining room.",

I like the fact that they are convinently located next to Trader Joes' and also within the metro shopping area.  I like their bar service, their music.  I would prefer that their waiters talk less to the bar customers and attend more to other dinning customers.  But otherwise, it is a good place to go for sushi, noodles, hand rolls in the afternoon.  I forgot to mention that the waiter who serviced me was nice enough to let me take a freshly brewed green tea in a cup to go.  That was a nice gesture!   If you are with a large group of people, I would ask them to set aside an area for you.  But if you are a couple who plans to order a few dishes for sharing, ask them for a booth in the back for privacy.  The booths are cute and adds more value to create that Japanese feel of a tatami. :)",

I would probably go back if I was in the area and was craving sushi.   The service was good, waitress was readily available to take our orders for our next plates once we started running low. The ambiance is pretty nice, trendy and modern. I went during lunch and I happened to be in a seat where the sun was shining in my face. At the time, there weren't any shades that could have been pulled down so that was a little meh.",

Pisces is a decent place to go for sushi in a town with a lot of sushi options. The reason I am writing this review now is that I went to Pisces last night for a drink and found 1/2 priced glasses of wine on Mondays (and a packed restaurant) --which was a nice start prior to our dinner @ Dressler's next door.

I requested a few rolls and nigiri and asked the server if they could serve them without rice.  The server checked with management and told me they could not take off the rice.  Not only could they not take off the rice but they would charge me extra for not eating the rice!  Are you &@(/-)@! kidding me?  The sushi rolls had 10% seafood and 90% rice .... This is not acceptable for anyone, unless you just don't know better or don't like sushi.  The minuscule amount of seafood inside the roll was fresh and tasted good, hence the two stars.

    "text": "How many sushi places does Charlotte have vs. need?!  But why not, my motto is never say no to sushi.  This place has a chic environment, nice location (close enough to Uptown but don't have to worry about parking; good for pre-party dining), and opens late (which is always good for that late night sushi crave).  Been here a few times, and honestly it's nothing too special.  My recap of tonight's experience:  Service was average, got seated right away (considering there's not waiting area to speak of, I don't think they have much choice but to get our butts to a table).  I had to look for my waiter to get my glass refilled at least once.  It took awhile to get our food, but we were busy talking so it wasn't a problem.  My friend ordered a last drink and asked for the check, and guess what, he got the check and not the drink.   Food was ok.  But for the price, I have to say the portion is tiny.  One order will not feed a grown person (comparing to Enzo, for instance, where one order is enough to feel somewhat full).  The Dragon Roll came apart a little when I picked it up with my chopsticks.  The rice in both runchy rolls (we had Philly & Spicy Salmon) seem a little mushy.  We capped off our dinner with an order of red bean ice cream (which if you haven't tried, it's the best freaking ice cream flavor... and don't worry, you can get this at any sushi/japanese place, not just here... and they all taste similar).  I have never seen a worse scoop shape of ice cream in my entire dining life.  Bascially it's just one bowl of ice cream mess, but at least it tastes good.  So I guess I won't be running here, but maybe with a twist of an arm, I will stroll over.",

The decor is very hip and modern and you might want to wear something a bit nicer than shorts and a t-shirt for dinner lest you feel under dressed.  The sushi prices are fair and the rolls are a decent size. The rolls weren't really anything special for me and I can't really recall what they tasted like. Though I recall having a roll slathered in mayo and even with my love of mayo it was too much for me. Forgetting what the rolls taste like might be a side effect of their drink specials though. Super cheap and extremely strong well drinks are offered on the cheap on Wednesday nights, and they have different drink specials every night of the week but I've only been on Wednesdays.  The servers and hostesses are super friendly, they even gave me some free drinks and a few free rolls my second time there! The location, atmosphere, and cheap drinks are nice, however since I can't really call the sushi here very special or even remember it So I'd probably choose other options closer to home given the chance.",

    "text": "Dinner started out great. The decor was very nice as well, especially liked the rock wall. Our waitress was witty, prompt and above all, honest. When i asked about the calamari, she plainly stated it sucked. I appreciate that heads up. The drinks came out quick and I really appreciated that.   Those were the last drinks we would have for 20 minutes. We sat, admiring the walls, waiting and waiting and waiting. Our waitress would appear nearby but never approach our table.  20 minutes went by and an appetizer arrived. 10 minutes after that our sushi. It was mediocre, nothing special. Anyone that raves about this place having the best sushi has obviously not been exposed to many sushi restaurants. This sushi was uninspired and bland.   I will not return, esp. with truly delicious sushi available for the same price at Jade in Ballantyne!",

Food was delicious, both the hibachi and the sushi were as good as anywhere else in Charlotte if not better. Only small annoyance was that half of our table was brought food and the rest didn't get theirs for another 10 minutes. Kitchen staff should work on getting food ready together. Otherwise a great experience.",

    "text": "The lunch waitress made my first experience my last with her lack of time management skills. I ordered  three different sushi's under the all-you-can-eat lunch special. With only an hour for lunch I was expecting this to be a quick and tasty experience, however her 10-20 minute interval table check made it impossible to enjoy the tasteful sushi . When I expressed  my issue with the manager as far as the waitresses time management skill, she over talked me and my guest and condescendingly explained how the waitresses are all taught to read the menu and check back with customers and a list of other things her waitress failed to do this time around. We noticed during our dining that customers seated after us were served in a speedier fashion than ourselves. We were not looking for empathy or a free meal, however we were just offering the heads up that staff may need to be reminded what's expected of them. The owner ended up explaining to us that he was very sorry for the experience and he holds every employee to higher expectations than what was shown today. After this I rather take my chances elsewhere.",

    "text": "Wanting to try Pisces for a while, I finally made the 3 mile trek.  In general, I had a good experience.   Decor - The space is cool.  It's basically an open space with some private booths in the back.  We were offered the last private booth, which we accepted, only to find out the two of us had to sit next to each other facing a wooden divider.  We lasted about 2 minutes before we asked to be re-seated.  It was just a touch too weird with the divider 18 inches in front of your face.  Thankfully, the restaurant was not overly crowded and we were able to be reseated.    The service was very attentive and provided for a great experience.  +1 for our server.   The sushi was pretty good, albeit standard, across the board.  The white tuna nigiri was delicious.  However, there was one odd item which we ordered - Salmon Toro.  Toro is a Tuna with a high amount of fat in it, making it buttery.  We tried the salmon toro hoping for the same taste.  What we found was the regular salmon was more buttery, and the Salmon Toro was rather fishy tasting....  We'll skip that when we go back.    All in all, the food was good, quality service and pretty reasonable prices.  Definitely check it out.",

    "text": "Honestly, I feel like half the rolls on the menu have the same ingredients, but I like most of those ingredients so I'm okay with it.  My first lunch at Pisces was a on saturday (no ayce deal) and even though we didn't see any booths we accepted the hostess' offer to sit in one. She took us into the almost empty restaurant and down a hallway to the right, and voila! booths with cute fishbowl shaped privacy cut outs. (or fine, just circles, but we liked the idea of fishbowls) we ordered four different rolls, and they were all decent, though we each clearly had a least favorite (my brain and taste buds had a hard time deciding if tomatoes should be on sushi). The service was attentive, and we enjoyed our meal even though we could hear every word of the conversation a few booths overs.   My second lunch fell on a weekday, and the ayce special. (You order off an abridged menu, it's not a buffet) I was a little hesitant since they go out of their way to say they'll charge you for waste (especially leftover rice on your plate) and really, it seems a little unnecessary. But, we did learn that the orders are half rolls, so if you choose a spicy tuna and a cucumber roll, you'll get four pieces of each instead of a full eight pieces of each. We ended up just ordering off the regular menu but plenty of people around us were loving the special.  Even though I've tried a roll in every price range (they're nicely listed in increasing prices on the menu), nothing really sets Pisces apart. Yes, the spicy tuna roll is good, but it doesn't stand out against another spicy tuna in town. They do have some nice flavor combos (though I haven't really delved into the ones with cream cheese, not my favorite sushi ingredient), eating at Pisces again would be more out of convenience since it's minutes from my house than going for a specific roll.  Overall good service, and not a long wait even when it was packed during the week.",

We were seated on what seemed like a communal table inches away from other parties. We asked for a booth (saw at least 3 open). They told us 'only one booth is left and we have to save it. Ok fine.  We were served cat-foody sushi with hard dry rice. Grosser than grocery store sushi. Good thing the portions were TINY because I couldn't choke down any more.   Overall the waitress was rude and stupid. She brought me the wrong thing once and NEVER brought my sauce. We asked to split the check and the idiot brought out two checks alright....she charged us both for the whole table! Oh and your TIP IS AUTOMATIC- I had to tip over 30% where no tip was deserved. When I'm spending my money I want to enjoy myself.   One star because I didn't get food poisoning.",
