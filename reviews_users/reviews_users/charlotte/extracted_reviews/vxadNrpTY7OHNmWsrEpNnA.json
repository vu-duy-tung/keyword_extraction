The breakfast is good but typical greasy spoon kind of food. Decor is solidly tacky. This place is all about DESERT and the desert case is always full of pastries and cheesecake on display. The young ladies that work there are appealing in a refreshing natural way.",

    "text": "The Landmark is a good diner.  After all, Guy Fiere has eaten here (Food Network: Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives).  The food is standard for what you would expect.  I had a western omelet, rye toast, bacon, coffee, OJ, and bacon.  The coffee was amazing - which is key for a good diner.  The rest of the food looked good but was lacking in flavor which was disappointing.  I am going to chalk it up to an off day or maybe what I ordered.  The house favorite seems to be the French toast.  I missed out this round but next time it's on!  Seriously, people rave about how good the French toast is.  Also, I've got to try their deserts.  They look out of this world and are made on site at a bakery they have in the basement of the Diner.  In fact, I may just go for desert and coffee sometime.  As for the rest of the experience, the service was excellent,  the environment is perfect for a diner: clean, cozy, it just has that certain Je ne sais quoi.  Despite being on Central Ave, the crowd is diverse in a way you will not feel out place.  Also, people bring their kids (at least for breakfast anyway) so you can consider this a good family place.  Now, at night that is probably another story as the night can bring out a different element.    As I had said, this is a good diner.  I will be back soon!",

I have gotten the fried fish & calabash shrimp special with 2 sides of fries many times. It never fails to impress. My sister has gotten that a few times as well and she enjoys it too. Almost every single time she gets the chicken souvlaki. Both of my parents have also had it here and they love it as well. One time I was deciding what to get and I decided to try one of the daily specials. I got the salt & pepper catfish and I am very glad that I did! I ordered it with a fries and a cup of chicken soup as my sides. Everything in this meal was so great! The soup was good and the fries were cooked perfectly! It came with 6 pieces of fish which is so good for being a little less than $10. I was very impressed with this meal so I will most likely have it again. Also I have had the Salmon special and it is good! The food here will always fill you up and leave you with leftovers! Plus you can even take their amazing dessert to go. My personal favorite dessert is the chocolate mouse cake but all are very food. Honestly they have something for everyone here even my younger sister who is a very picky eater. It is a great place for a variety & just to have a good time!",

    "text": "I finally visited the famous Landmark Diner this past Sunday morning.  It's in a semi-sketchy part of town, but the restaurant itself looked very clean, updated, and not-at-all sketchy.    The breakfast menu was pretty big (although no benedicts), and the prices matched my small hometown's diners.  Now *that's* impressive for Charlotte.    I ordered the Northern omelet -- corned beef and swiss cheese.  It was good; your basic omelet with huge chunks of corned beef.  Someone else got the Challah French toast.  It was literally the BIGGEST order of French toast I've ever seen in my life.  The bread slices were about 2\" thick.  The country ham side had been \"rinsed\" (at the recommendation of our server) but it was still very salty.  Good, but salty.  Another member of our party got the pork chops and eggs entree.  For only $8, there were eggs, potatoes, toast, and TWO pork chops.  It was a great deal for a very hungry boy.    If you have room after their huge portions, there's always dessert.  And I'm not talking just any dessert.  These are massive-sized desserts.  Three- and four-layer cakes.  Turnovers the size of your head.    Big meals, fantastic prices, pleasant atmosphere, and a clean restaurant.  What more could you ask for in a restaurant/diner?",

It was just a little cheese sprinkled on top of the omelet with salsa and the cheese wasn't even melted. There was nothing inside the omelet and it had a few sprinkles of green onions on top. That was the worst omelet I've ever had. I can make better omelet at home, which is what I should have done. I was very disappointed. They need to take a lesson or two from IHOP!!",

My husband got the tom turkey with dressing and it was a enough for two maybe three people and very good.. My Dad got the liver and onions and loved them. The menu has sooo much to choose from. The  desserts were beautiful and also  so much to choose from. We took home some baklava and it was divine. The only downer was the pastrami sandwich it was not good at all however the onion rings were perfection. Definitely will return, especially for desserts. The service was spot on.

I was in Charlotte for the weekend so I thought why not try out a restaurant from that show.   I came there on a Sunday morning. The line was out the door like any busy, famous, and neighborhood-friendly restaurant for brunch. (TIP: Always go where the locals go.) We waited for 15 minutes and were seated quickly.  The waitress and staff were sweet...like how they should be in the south. We ordered jalapeno bombers for appetizers. It was good...like Church's Chicken good! I had the greek sampler... moussaka (greek lasagna), Spanakopita (spinach pie) and graped leaves stuffed with rice and feta cheese. Oh, I had a side of green beans and corn but too full to touch it. My favorite was the moussaka because I'm not a big fan of feta cheese that was in the spanakopita and grape leaves. It was good and I finished it. I ate what was suggested on Tripple D so I left there happy and full.  Oh, don't forget to check out the desserts in the glass window by the door.",

It was fine. The turkey was tasty but the dressing was overly saged. The gravy also had an odd consistency and no real flavor. For sides, I had Mac and Cheez (tasty) and collards (very poorly seasoned).   The desert case is always an impressive sight, but I didn't partake today. I'd return to try the breakfast. I've heard good things. Worth a try for sure, but don't expect greatness just because Triple D was there.",

Curious?  I'll save the best for last and start with our appetizer that we had to try after hearing Guy Fieri rave about it - the spannakopita. Lots of spinach and the first I had ever had with dill, but it really worked!  For the entree, my waitress was raving about the chicken slouvaki so I gave it a shot. Pretty solid. My wife had a BLT and fries. Safe choice but solid again. Now is where the real fireworks happened...   On the way out we passed by a glass case I had already eyed on my way in and we couldn't resist the temptation. Ordered a slice of carrot cake and two pieces of baklava. Both items were best-in-freaking class and were devoured as soon as we got home. They make each daily and you can tell. The carrot cake had lots of goodies (coconut, raisins, etc) and the icing was great. As for the baklava, the best I have had, and this coming from someone whose childhood friend was second generation Greek whose mom made fresh baklava weekly. 3 stars overall, but 5 for that glass case!",

It's comfortable and has a gigantic menu with plenty of variety. It is a Charlotte staple and that is why I keep going back.   The food is not outstanding. Most things are  okay at best. Other things are just gross, like their southwestern omelet. Never order that. Their coffee is hot, brown-tinted water, but they are quick to refill it for you. (If I can see through my coffee, I'm not happy.)   Their service is a mix. Some servers are not very attentive and others are too pushy and tend to over-share. The dessert case is impressive. Though, some items look better than they taste. The chocolate cake, for example, is huge, but it has no flavor! How can you have a four layer chocolate cake that doesn't taste like chocolate? Most of the other sweets are pretty good.   It's also one if the most fascinating places to people watch. Go for that, if nothing else.",

I ordered biscuits with gravy, eggs over medium with a side of country ham and a cup of coffee.  It was a lot of food for 10 bucs.  The biscuit was ok (not as good as the one I had at McDonalds yesterday) as was the gravy - not real flavorful.  The eggs were fresh, but were cooked over easy to where I could not get them on a fork.  That was the best part of the meal.  The country ham was large and served with a steak knife.  Now I know why.  It was grilled so long that it was the consistency of jerky.  It was hard to cut and harder to chew.  It also had a very strong swine taste, which got worse the more I ate.  I really liked the atmosphere, the friendly waitress and the quick service, but the food was not good enough for a return visit.  But it was a lot of food for 10 bucks!",

    "text": "What can I say about Landmark?  \"Special\" seems insufficient.    Outside of the airport, this is THE BEST place to people watch!  Located on Central Avenue, you'll quickly discover that this isn't the best part of town.  However, they cater to everyone.  The owners are Greek and the menu offers a multitude of Greek inspired entrees.  The food is good and the desserts are amazing.  Baked fresh daily, they offer a wide variety of desserts in gigantic portions.  Because they have so many options that are all homemade, they don't offer every dessert every day of the week.  They offer daily specials that will give you the biggest bang for your buck.  The baby back ribs are some of the best I've ever had and the lobster bisque will knock your socks off!  The Greek specialties are well worth a trip as well.  This is a great place to meet with friends and kickback over a cup of coffee.  I often visit with friends simply to enjoy a sweet treat and a cup of Joe over conversation while people watching.  We've certainly seen some interesting characters milling about.  This is also a frequent hangout for CMPD officers on their coffee break.  The service is varied and most of the servers have broken English.  The ones that do speak clear English are usually slurring their words for other reasons.  Look closely and you may see a little white powder around their nostrils.  No joke.  Like I said, people watching at its finest folks!  I've seen potential serial killers, drug dealers, little people, one eyed Willie, Uncle Duck, Big Mama and many more...",

Not only was this soup light and flavorful but the cheese was melty goodness. My husband ended up helping me finish (and he's not a soup kind of person). The main course was fantastic, loads of food! I managed to devour my plate but my husband and daughter barely got by.  Overall our experience was great, it gets really loud and some parents aren't able to keep their kids from running around. Other than that it's really good food and fast service!",

The gentleman who I guess is a manager here said he \"can't replace the food simply because you don't like it, cause other customers like it so there is nothing I can do if you dont\" I always come here, the staff is wonderful and I never have any problems. And whenever we didn't like something they always replaced it. No problem, excellent service.

It has two sides with a counter and another side with booths and tables. The menu is large  with a ton of options. The group I was with tried a few breakfast items and a few dinner items.  For breakfast items the challah French toast and pancakes are both light, fluffy and flavorful. Would order both again. The dinner entrees were a club sandwich and baked ziti. The club sandwich  was huge and tasty. Baked ziti was ok and garlic bread was surprisingly solid. We also had a side of Mac and cheese which was excellent. A old school style.  Finally we tried a piece of lemon cake and tall chocolate cake. Both were moist,  light and very tasty.  Overall a very solid visit and I look forward to return visits.",

I will still give them 3 stars bc I love the turkey plate there and grilled cheese with soup, simple but home style comfort food to me. The deserts are delicious. But I hate their staff. Idk if they are hired or family but all need attitude adjustments and retraining.  On numerous times during the night shift they pick and choose customers. Some they will allow in and others that aren't of considerable \"race\" to them they turn away.  They should know if they hours are on the door people expect service",

I have been hitting up the Landmark Diner for more than 20 years and it's still just a diner, nothing special really until you start looking for a little dessert after your meal, that's where this place really shines. The dessert case is stuffed with freshly baked Greek pastries and all manner of cakes and pies! I recommend the tall chocolate cake or maybe the carrot cake if you're on a diet. The key lime pie ain't too bad either. I digress, the food is diner fare.  When I say diner fare I mean that you could stop at any of the thousands of Denny's or Waffle House locations around the country and have a very similar meal. You will not have a cake or pie or pastry anywhere else that will top this place. The desserts are where it's at here!",

Unlike the stereotypical diner, this location appears to have lots of different people, it does not cater to a certain type, it caters to everyone. The Italian foods are good and nobody I know has left incredibly unhappy ever. The service is good and the deserts taste great. The prices are average for what you get, and the decor is typical semi-outdated diner colored blah. In conclusion, a good, average restaurant if you want a quick and easy eating experience.",

We were seated and after a while or so a waiter comes to take our drink order ( granted they were busy so I will let his tardiness to greet us slide) We get our drinks and there are more people coming in and they are seated. We order our food and patiently wait as we see everyone else receive their orders including the people that came in after us. More time passes by,an hour to be exact ...by this point we are late to where we had to be. I see our waiter attending other tables and we still are sipping our watered out drinks, I give him one more opportunity to pass by without our food, and then I call him over and let him know that it has been an hour and a half waiting on our food, I am tired of waiting and no longer want my food. He explains to me that one of the dishes we order takes time to make, but I am not buying that it takes an hour and a half to make one plate. I wait 5 more minutes and out of utter frustration decide to leave, my party leaves while i go over to the cashier to pay at least for our watered down drinks and saltine crackers that one of us ate, right as I am leaving the food comes out and I was instructed to pay for the food, that I just said i no longer want. The cashier tells me that the food has to be paid for now because it is already cooked. I told them I refuse to pay for food that i am not going to eat. And she insisted that I can at least take it to go and wait even more time for it to be put into a box..needless to say I paid for food that I waited an hour and 45 minutes for that I did not eat. I will never be back, nor recommend anyone else to go there.",

The waitress (Natasha) was wonderful - she recommended many favorites, one of them being the ribs - which I ordered and they were awesome!  The  food took a little long to get to us (no doubt because of how busy they were) and at one point my 2 year old son started crying because he saw the table next to us get their food and thought the French fries were for him -  well the waiter noticed my son crying and quickly went to the back to get him a plate of fries to tide him over.  So thoughtful!  And that gesture makes me want to give them more business!  The dessert selection is off the charts and so is the tall chocolate cake!

Then we waited an hour for our food (for a table of 5)  and half of ours came out cold.  when we finally asked for the manager he came to our table dropped off our food didnt introduce himself or anything.  we actually had no idea he was the manager till the waitress told us.  it was my cousins birthday so my aunt asked if they did anything special they dont and she said not unless you want to order a cannoli or something.  she then brought it out after my aunt told here no and tried to use the fact shes hard of hearing as an excuse.

    "text": "Yet another gem I have discovered as I eat my way through my new neighborhood!  My bf and I went here on a Friday night at about 1 am, after a little bit of drinking because we were starving.  The first thing I noticed, the beautiful dessert case that lures you in as soon as you step in the door.  So many cakes, pies, brownies, cheesecake....agggghhhhh.  So tempting!  The next standout is by far the gigantic, atlas-sized menu that has about anything you could possibly want on it.  We eliminated certain pages that we knew we didn't want and narrowed it down from there.  It's definitely a daunting task!  I went with 3 cheese mannicotti and my bf had roast turkey with gravy, stuffing, and cranberry sauce.  The portions were HUGE!!!  And very reasonably priced.  The food came out really fast and while it was not the best mannicotti I've ever had, it was damn tasty and the tomato sauce was right on.  The best part about my meal, however, was by far the pineapple coconut cake I had for dessert.  Oh My God....I cannot tell you how yummy this slice of sugary heaven was.  Light and airy, with layers of pineapple filling.....mmmmmmmm.  Bf had strawberry cheesecake and it was not good.  It was too thick and the strawberries had no flavor.....my suggestion, eat the cake!",

    "text": "We wanted to grab a quick bite to eat, so headed to The Landmark Diner on Central Ave. We could tell from the parking lot that they were packed, but decided to give it a try.   When the hostess told us it would be 15 minutes, she saw a look pass between us that said we didn't want to stay. We were about to leave, when a host said he had a small table in the bar, if we didn't mind.   We didn't mind at all, as we were hungry and would have say anywhere. I ordered the Onion soup and my husband had the Ruben sandwich. The Onion Soup is THE BEST I have had in Charlotte! It comes in a nice big crock and is dripping with melted cheese; no skimping here. YUMMY. I also ordered some sides of vegetables, and they could have used some seasoning. They were OK, but that's it.   The manager came out with some fried squash and offered it to us. We were seated right next to the kitchen, so I guess they had an extra one and he felt bad for the poor location. It was nicely fried squash and was salted perfectly.   My husband enjoyed his sandwich, but he gobbled up the squash.   As usual, we were too full for dessert. Although they look great, we never have enough room for them.",

    "text": "Yes the menu is about 12 pages long and is probably as long in height as a newspaper when unfolded.  So our chances of getting at least one good thing on that menu appeared to be in our favor.  WRONG.   The first time I was with a friend. We shared stuffed mushrooms and thought, please don't let this be a prelude to our meal. Not so good.Nor was the tasteless huge slices of bread they bring.Was it stale?  I went for the Gyro.Figured Diner = Greek food, so, Gyro = Winner. Yeah, I figured wrong. The gyro at Showmars is wayyy better. The real kicker was the broiled seafood platter. Yes, I warned her, Don't order that .Until you know what the quality of a diner is ,everyone knows, stick to the basics. Well after that awful dish,we learned quickly \"the quality\" of this diner. Let's just say I'm not the type of person to say \"I told ya so\"  Should I even comment about the service?Maybe not.  It might be a good idea to offer drinks in two sizes.I know myself, I have  a big thirst but the size of the glass to serve a beverage in was puny.I took like one sip, it was gone.Even my female friend was looking at her empty glass in three sips and trying to get refills was a joke.  The best part of the meal was actually not even our meal itself. It was the visual of the dessert case when we walked in that started to make us instantly salivate which tasted delicious in our mind.  Who knows maybe we just ordered the wrong things,but if we decide to give it another go, It will be for breakfast. Diner = Breakfast, So, AHHHHH this theory is shot.",

Over the past ten years we have always found our way back. This morning we decided to go for breakfast. We had terrible service. We were seated in a booth and our waiter, while friendly, was just out of sorts. He got our drink order wrong twice and brought out luke warm coffee. We had a small accident at the table and needed napkins. It took him well over 5 min to bring more napkins. Finally, when he attempted to correct the drink order he brought me a dirty glass. That prompted me to inspect my silverware, it too was grimy. I am not sure if the owners have changed but the Landmark I have loved for over a decade is not the same. The service is horrible and the food is not good anymore. The week prior we ordered take out salads and they were not well prepared. Steer clear!",

    "text": "The first thing you see when you walk into Landmark is a giant pastry case stuffed with delicious looking desserts.  This is pleasant to look at for a while, but this is where my pleasant dining experience ended.    Our service was lackluster, at best, borderline surly at worst.  Drinks were not refilled except upon request and despite our friendliness, it seemed almost impossible to get our waitress to crack a smile.  The restaurant wasn't busy at all so I'm not sure what her problem was, but it was definitely off-putting.  I ordered 2 eggs over easy with toast, bacon, and fries. I'm allergic to onions, and home fries sometimes have onions, and I wanted potatoes, so I decided to play it safe.  After all, how bad can a plate of fries be?  As it turns out, pretty bad.  Like our service, they seemed lackluster, bored.  Maybe I shouldn't expect a diner to have amazing fries, but I've had amazing fries at diners before, and with such an extensive menu and supposed high status among Charlotte local restaurants, it wouldn't kill them to make a batch of crispy fries that didn't just lay insipidly and moody on the plate, refusing to be brightened with a generous ketchup bath.  The bacon was fried up too crispy for my liking, but that's a matter of personal taste.  Everyone agreed that the fries were...not great.  The eggs were fine the toast was actually really good (especially dipped in egg yolk...mmmmmm)   The rest of my party were also less than satisfied with their food.  They also nickel-and-dime you really hard for substitutions like a bagel and cream cheese, which is a huge pet peeve of mine.  Is toasting up a bagel and bringing out a packet of cream cheese really so cost-prohibitive that you've gotta soak me for 12 bits?    All in all it was a LACKLUSTER diner AND dining experience.  You want normal diner food, go to the neighboring San Remo or Liberty East.  If you want EXCEPTIONAL diner food, go to Mattie's Diner.  If you want a step up from Waffle House, by all means check out Landmark.    Just don't order the fries.",

The last time our family ate there, my wife said that the chocolate cake was that great ( usually is ) ......mind you she just said  this to the waitress who asked if all was ok. The owner came to our table and really showed is butt off. Sadly this was not the first such experience but I can assure you it will be the last. We put up with their rudeness and poor service because the food was better than average for too long.

It was pretty late, but you didn't get the sense from the servers that they just wanted to get out of there. I do have to say that the restaurant is kind of out there, so it was a bit of a hike off of I-77. Overall, 3.5 stars would probably be more accurate, but that is not an option! I would definitely go back on a late night if I am passing through.",

This is the first of hopefully many 24-hour (or at least, extended-hour) restaurant reviews I want to write, and I'm actually saddened not to be able to give this place a better review because I had such high expectations. But, alas, I must.    I wanted to have a little celebration tonight, and since drinking is a no-no for me these days, the next best thing, of course, is pie.  Having heard great things about Landmark's deserts, I made a date to meet up at 9pm and check them out for myself. The decor of Landmark is nice and cozy, and it is heartening to see all the hustle and bustle inside this restaurant on such a desolate area of Central Ave. When you walk in, you are immediately struck by the incredible dessert case. We sat down and ordered decaf and our waiter told us that he would brew us up a fresh pot.  Very nice.  We then got to the ordering--once piece of banana cream pie and one hot cherry pie a la mode. The pie slices came out quickly and looked incredible, but unfortunately, looks can be deceiving.  The banana cream pie was loaded with a cool-whip type topping, not the real whipped cream that I think truly makes a banana cream pie.  The pie filling itself seemed to have a lot of that cool-whip filling in it as well and very few bananas, which just didn't work. While the cherry pie was sufficiently warm and the ice cream acceptably cold, I wasn't impressed by the pie crust--it just seemed a little dense and cake-like. The deserts WERE huge, but I think they ultimately had a  size over substance problem.  I didn't order any \"real\" food, so I can't speak to that, but, in all, I'd have to say the pie slices we ordered were a disappointment.",

As a restaurant server, I work To Go orders daily, so I'm used to people changing their minds, or editing their orders.  I called the diner to place an order for Buffalo wings, unaware that my husband had already ordered food from another establishment. Not even 3 MINUTES after placing my order, I called back to cancel and the woman told me \"THE ORDER HAD ALREADY BEEN PLACED AND THEY PROBABLY ALREADY STARTED MAKING THE WINGS.\" She then told me to be \"more sure next time\" before calling to place an order for pick up.  EXCUSE ME?!? Management needs to train this employee on PHONE ETIQUETTE and professional mannerisms before allowing her to take another order.  I would have been fired if I EVER spoke to a guest in such a manner.  Rude.  Never Again.",

Go figure that on a Saturday night, the place was packed and we were told by the hostess and by our waiter that they were short staffed. Which did make for a 30 minute wait for a table and then a wait to place our order. But by that point, it got back to normal.  My wife had the Greek salad and pronounced it excellent. Loaded with feta cheese, anchovies and lots more stuff than lettuce, she said it was fresh and crisp and very tasty. The included pita bread slices were excellent.  Having checked the reviews, I opted for the chicken souvlaki. Lots and lots of chicken, a great salad and a big pile of tasty fries. Yum!  Pastry counter looked awesome. Cheese danishes. Cinnamon horns. Cherry turnovers. Wow!  Very inexpensive meal and once the crowd was clear, the service was great.",

My daughter ordered flounder and they gave her old trout. The owner Larry would not come out to 20+ years customers to address the issue. We are not the type of people who try to look for discounts on our meals but we felt the owner should have done something to compensate us. My Daughter is now throwing up. This 20+ year relationship is over. For the amount of money we spend whenever we come here we can certainly find better places to eat.",

They peel then boil the potatoes, then cut them into irregular shapes and finish them on the grill.  Each of the potatoes had a proper sear on them which gently crunched in my mouth on each bite.

I also got rye toast with my meal. I loaded up on ketchup- always been a \"Ketchup Kid!\" My friends are regulars here- one got a deluxe burger and the other got fish; they enjoyed their meals too!  We parked in the rear lot behind the business where it looks a little sketchy, but there are a bunch of spaces.

I had a few bites and tossed it aside...... The home fries were okay a little dry but okay...... I also tried the pancakes and they were quite uneventful.......

The desserts are massive, with apple turnovers the size of your head and cake slices that are easily enough to feed 3-4 persons.  The bad - the entrees were just not good.  The open faced beef sandwich had thin dry roast beef (almost jerky) covered in a gravy so thick and floury that you couldn't eat it without lots of water.  The vegetable soup was tomato based but tasted like Campbell's or Progresso that had been heavily peppered.  Except for the salads, the rest of the meal was pretty rough.

From the row of older gentlemen, sitting at the countertop, reading papers, to the quality and variety of the menu, this is a NY/NJ diner. I ordered the Pastrami and Swiss omelette and was blown away by the amount of food, as well as the quality.

    "text": "Paula and I travel to Charlotte about 5-6 times a year. We both grew up in the North (d**n Yankees!) and we've bemoaned the lack of *real* diners in the South since we moved here in 1998. All too often, we will drive up to a place that calls itself a diner, only to find that it is nothing more than a glorified soda shop and hamburger joint - not that there is anything wrong with that, mind you, it's just that we have always had high hopes of finding something like what we remembered back home, and come away feeling empty.  So when we saw the Landmark featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, we decided to give it a shot. Getting there was definitely NOT half the fun - it's in one of the least attractive parts of Charlotte, and you can't see the sign until you are nearly past the entrance to the parking lot. If you are coming up Central Avenue from Eastway Drive - which you probably will be if you are coming from I-85 or from the south side of town - you want to turn left just at the end of the median, right after you pass Kilborne Drive. Parking is shared with a small strip shopping center, and there's not a whole lot of it, but every time we have gone the place has been packed.  Once you get there, you will realize as soon as you walk in that this is, indeed, a diner. The menu for both breakfast and dinner is huge, with many classic diner favorites and an array of specials. Prices are about as reasonable as you could ask, with many choices under $10. Portion sizes are large - we wonder sometimes how they make money given what they charge and the amount of food you get.  Recommendations:  1. Any meal with stuffing as a side dish. I've had the pork and stuffing, and Paula's had the turkey dinner. The proteins are cooked perfectly, and the stuffing is just like Mom (or Grandma) used to make. 2. Pot pies. These are HUGE! We're not talking some small Swanson-sized tin here, we're talking a full-size tureen! 3. The French toast made with Challah bread. Go lightly on the butter and syrup, and savor the bread; trust me, you will be glad that you did.  I was mildly disappointed in the omelets, but that's mostly because I am a cheese-a-holic and the omelet was *very* light on filling.  If you're missing diners, this is the place to go. Now if we can just teleport a clone to Raleigh...",

The food is good, just as most diners, lots of selection! I would not say the service was excellent, but it was almost as if you were having dinner at your grandmother's house.  They really cared, and that was what set it apart for me.  They even gave my 3 yr old several options for the animal he would like his pancake to be! He chose a turtle, which made his day! We will definitely be going back!!!",

Their all day breakfast items looked delicious - especially the decadent challah french toast! I decided to be a purist and go for a traditional chicken souvlaki plate. SO GOOD. Juicy, marinated chicken chunks on a warm pita with a light yet flavorful Greek salad on the side, plus their homemade tzaziki sauce. I could've eaten the tzaziki with a spoon. The portion sizes are generous as are the prices. I'm excited to return for an omelette and check out their extensive menu soon!",

The menu is more expansive than it needs to be, but most choices seem solid from the small percentage we've been able to sample so far.   Last night, our group of three ordered regular meals, and enough food appeared to feed 6 or more. Nothing stood out as The Best version of (Tour of Greece, Texas BBQ Burger, Tom Turkey platter, etc.) that any of us had ever had, but it was all served hot, quick, in large portions, and well under budget. After a long day-into-night at work, and battling traffic on the snowy roads, it was just what the doctor ordered. The dessert case was beyond tempting, but sadly, none of us had any room after the smorgasbord that had been laid in front of us.  Regarding breakfast, three simple words:  Challah.  French.  Toast.  That is all.",

With breakfast, lunch and dinner all day and night, you have a huge selection of options.  From roast beef to turkey to shrimp salad to tuna melts to gyros, they got your covered.  Our waitress was so incredibly nice, even at 11 PM at night.    The onion rings were a little too thin and over fried, but other than that, no complaints at all about the food.  Plus, they were featured on diners and divers. We selected this place because it was open late and only 20 minutes from where we were staying and we were not disappointed.",

    "text": "So....my boyfriend was wanting to try \"some place new\" and he loves chicken pot pie (which I don't cook because I don't like) and heard that they have it as a special on Thursday night. To me, this place was just okay and I won't rush back. Here's the run down:  Food: there were a lot of options and it was a little overwhelming. Our waitress really recommended the turkey with stuffing so I went out on a limb and tried it. I liked it as much as I think I could like turkey with stuffing. There was a lot of gravy (which I scraped off) and I didn't even finish 1/2 of the meal. I also started with a salad with greek vinaigrette. I actually liked the vinaigrette. I just wish there had been some cucumbers or something in the salad - it was just bag mix of iceberg lettuce and some tomatoes. My boyfriend loved his chicken pot pie. It was huge and came out piping hot. He says he would recommend it to others but would want to try some of their others items next time since they had so many options. We took the strawberry shortcake home and tried it later and we were not fans. It was pretty dry.   Price: Honestly, the prices are great. Nothing more to say about that.  Service: I'm split here. Let me explain. Our waitress was Christine and she was so friendly, funny, attentive, and helpful. We really enjoyed her. When we went to pay, my boyfriend was standing at the counter and asked for dessert to go. The woman he was paying asked the other hostess (a young woman with long blond hair) to get the dessert. I'm not sure what happened but she came back to the counter 2 minutes later and threw our dessert on the counter and then stormed away. It was so awkward and extremely unprofessional. The woman checking out next to us just stared and said \"why does she have an attitude?\" It was sad that this was how we ended our dining experience. Without her temper tantrum, I would've given this place three stars.",

I'm not one to complain, furthermore asking for discounts or free food. First- there were 3 of us. We ordered and waited and waited, meanwhile watching everyone around us ordering and food coming out after us. Second- 20 minutes later AFTER everyone in the dining area had their food, the waitress came over and said she didn't know what happened and went to find out. I ordered the chicken philly ( just meat and cheese ) they cooked it with peppers and onions, so they had to remake it, then it came out with mushrooms. I was fine with that and picked out all the mushrooms. My bread was soggy so I was eating just the chicken. The waitress went to ask the Owner to discount the meal because of it being wrong twice. He said he wouldn't discount it but would remake it, therefore he wanted my sandwich back, so with chicken still in the bun and fries on my plate I gave her my plate and then the waitress came back to me and said he wouldn't remake it because you ate all the chicken out of it. Then I said give me my food back that you took from me and she brought out a whole new sandwich which has mushrooms on it again, knowing I didn't want that from the beginning. The customer service that the owner displayed tonight was unexceptionable and rude. They lost a loyal customer and I won't be back.",

The chicken was okay, had a little seasoning...wasn't the worst chicken I have been served. The alfredo?Zero taste. No salt. No seasoning. It was the most bland pasta sauce I have ever had in my life. I had to load it with salt and pepper for it to even taste like anything. Large portion though. Second time- Chicken fingers, loaded potato. The loaded potato is the only thing from Landmark that I would eat again. The chicken tenders were tough. Third try today- turkey triple decker club sandwich and onion rings. OKAY. This seemed like a safe choice. WRONG. The turkey is a \"carved\" turkey....and it is disgusting. It smells like bad lunch meat packaging. Its white and large chunks, and the cheese is abysmal off brand cheddar slices. I asked for mayo but no condiments on the sandwich. The bacon/lettuce/tomato is decent. I wish it had been a BLT. The onion rings are okay, and the ranch is very good thankfully. Really..if you have any self respect at all about what kind of food you spend your money on...just take the money you planned to spend here and go elsewhere. Or cook at home.

    "text": "So my friends and I had come in rather late at night, around 11 due to an event that kept us later than expected, and we were hungry since we hadn't eaten since 12 that afternoon. We were seated promptly and the menu was rather diverse with low price points. We also were recommended to this place by locals so we had some decent hopes too. Together we ordered 2 appetizers, two burgers, and 2 gyro platters.   When the appetizers came it turned out alright, nothing special but it had some taste. Then the entrees came out and the portions were surprisingly large, so it looked good. But then we had a taste of everything. The burgers were tasteless and bland, the fries on the sides had no flavor or seasoning, and my potato salad that I received as a substitute for fries tasted like nothing. It was a heavy disappointment. The gyros were decent in terms of taste but they ended up rather dry. We were planning on getting desert but the meal was so disappointing that we decided against it. It just seems like your paying for the quantity not the quality here.",

The portion sizes of food are relatively big but great for the price you pay. The first day the display case of sweets caught my eye but I was too full to try it and the same with the second time I went. I forced myself to get the Blueberry Pie anyways and it was worth me being miserable from eating too much. I loved every bite of the pie, French toast, omelette, grits, etc. Whenever I come to Charlotte again this will be one of the restaurants on my list!",

The menu is enormous and almost everything is amazing. I have been day and night and have never been disappointed. The food is diner food, so it can be a bit of greasy spoon, but you'll like it! The dessert case will greet you and you should definitely get something before you leave. I think they make everything homemade. I almost always start with the French Onion Soup -- they have some of the best. The Challah bread is so good too. Killer sandwiches here. I have tried several things and nothing has been bad. They are open super late. You have gotta hit this joint if your live in or are visiting Charlotte.",

The portions are huge, especially for lunch, so I definitely had a pre-dinner snack that day. The service was excellent as well. Our waiter ensured that our first visit was enjoyable and memorable.

We ordered our regular favorites, the chicken tenders dinner and the spanakopita dinner.  We complained and the waitress let us know there are always food problems at shift change in the kitchen.   We ended up sending our food back TWICE.  The chef came out to speak to us and was clueless about what was wrong with our food.    The chicken tenders were cooked too long until they were hard and inedible.  The stuffed baked potato was served burned and blackened.  The spanakopita was overbaked and the so called Greek salad that was supposed to come with it was 2 lettuce leaves with a cube of feta cheese on top of it.  We changed our orders to a Greek salad and the fish sandwich.  The salad was fine because there wasn't anything that they cooked in it.  The fish sandwich was terrible.  The Landmark has now lost 2 of their longtime customers.",

I have to admit, I'm really not sure what the hype was about, food-wise.  Hubby ordered a breakfast combo plate (bacon, eggs, biscuit, grits) and I ordered an omelet with home fries and a biscuit.  First thing's first....NOBODY in the South serves breakfast grits on a plate. Where was the bowl?  Grits grits everywhere, because these grits were on the soupy side.   I'm not sure who forgot about my home fries on the griddle, but I spent more time picking out over-cooked, hard, crusty, un-edible potato pieces out of my food than time spent actually eating the potatoes.  I think whomever was cooking my home fries also cooked my omelet because it was way past well-done too.  Our waitress was fabulous....super friendly, kept our drinks full, spent time with us when we first sat down (since it was our first visit), and was really genuine. :)  Maybe a better experience would have been had if I had dived head-first into the monstrous dessert display case up front.  Needless to say I gained weight just looking at them.  Seating and wheelchair accessibility was *almost* too cramped, but for being there around noon on a Saturday it was tolerable.",

It is always crowded and service is pretty fast . I would def go more often if I it was closer to me now that I moved !! Tip: order the chicken gyro or the meat loaf with their fresh salad - wow..to die for . Prices are just as expected for a diner",

The menu is so large that it might actually beat out the cheesecake factory. But it is those types of things that makes this a real winner for me. Diners are the best in my eyes when you can literally order anything you want from pancakes to a full Thanksgiving meal and then everything in between.",

As soon as you walk in you an tell that the atmosphere has changed. The staff is not as friendly. We ordered sodas. I had to send mine back twice because they were flat. Our orders came with bread and salads. We never received them. Two of us ordered the Italian Trio. It was awful! It was cold and tasteless. When I mentioned it to the manager i was told that they cant season the food because they have elderly customers. I guess the other customers don't count. I'm not sure if they're under new management but this restaurant has really gone down. And I think they need to stop using the Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives thing to get customers. That was way back when they were good.",

The wings were over priced and the plate was dirty, brought it to the waitress attention, she apologize and went to the other tables, the other ladies order omelettes, no cheese, hardly no meat and flat with little taste, everything was charged as a side order, the bacon was cold. I just gave up, the waitress never came, so had to go to front area for a box and notice the desserts, so wanted to try the chocolate layer cake, very thin slice and the price was a 6dllrs for the cake, now the waitress box the dessert and we when I went to pay for my food told the cashier I didn't want the cake, she questioned why I did explain portion size and she took the box cake and threw it on the side area where their joke of bar was.  Will never return here again, everyone gave good reviews, but it's a horrible diner, should had stayed at the Midnite Diner, but the line was so long, sometimes it's better to wait, even if it was a mile long, then you know this Diner must have been good.",

A harried young lady I can only assume was our server - she never introduced herself or apologized for making us wait - brought us our food pretty quickly after we ordered it.

    "text": "Every city has a number of diners, some more than others. Everyone living in that city swears loyalty to one of those diners-- whether because their family has always gone there, or there's a favorite menu item, or its in the right spot. This is my diner, and let me tell you why:  Awesome crowd. Church goers, large families, little old ladies, yuppies, hipsters-- everyone eats here. The time you go has some bearing on who you'll see, but I've seen a gramma in her sunday best chowing down on a stack of pancakes at 1 am, as well as a group of biker-dudes grabbing some early breakfast on a saturday. Very entertaining.  Huge menu. An essential for an awesome diner is having pages and pages of ameri-greek specials mixed with stand-by burgers, omelettes, fries, salad platters, short stacks. Landmark has it all.  Hours. Anytime you want a waffle, you can find one here. Always open, always politely staffed, and with an early-bird menu that takes an extra dollar off their already reasonably priced breakfast specials (my go-to is the Garden-- tons of veggies in a three-egg omelette, grits, biscuit or toast for $5.95), there's no reason for me to go anywhere else.   Nothing here is blow-you-away. But that isn't what diners are for. I come here because its comfy, the staff is terrific, the food is consistent and cheap, and I know I'll get exactly what I came for: a quick, cheap, decent meal.  Note: rumor has it they're \"experimenting\" with a house veggie burger (none on the menu yet). Might just bump 'em up a star once they start serving it, since the only issue I ever have is the small selection of veggie-friendly options in that massive menu.",

So after watching a diner's drive in and dives show, which featured this establishment, we decided to give it a try once we visited Charlotte. The Neighborhood is \"sketchy\" at best... I was a little worried about the outside not being much to look at. So imagine my suprise once inside to see the dessert case with (gasp) tasty and large treats to try. We went for dinner, and as Guy had suggested I tried the turkey dinner. It was lip smackin' good- as they like to say in the south. I fell in love instantly with this place.Just to be sure I wasn't dreaming about a good diner in the south, we came back the next morning for breakfast..and the dream became a reality. Our breakfast was just as tasty, and now every visit to Charlotte requires at least one- or two- stops at the Landmark Diner!",

The place is grubby in the way that only a 24 hour diner can accomplish, but it's a grubby I've come to love.  The staff is friendly when it's not too busy, and you can expect them to want to chat.   The menu is giant...it's like 2 feet tall and 15 pages long. You can get breakfast at midnight or have dinner at 6 a.m. The dinner and lunch entrees vary from Greek and Italian home-style specialties to classic American diner grub (burgers, steaks, fries, etc.)  Since I do the vegetarian thing, my favorites are the breakfast items and the Spanakopita. The Spanakopita dish comes with a lovely Greek side salad. I also like their stuffed grape leaves, even though I'm pretty sure that they came out of a jar.   Their cakes and pies are a little prettier than they are delicious, but really, even a pie that isn't perfect is still a delicious pie...You just can't go wrong with cake and sugary frosting. I tend to forgo the desserts, however, to save more room inside my guts for dinner.",

The meat had little flavor and was dry. What really got me was that the gyro sandwich was served as a platter. No lettuce, tomato, onion adornment here, just a flat lifeless combination of  meat and pita. I'm still looking for that gyro I can pick up with my hands and slowly tear at the paper as I sink my teeth into a mother load of spiced meat and tzatziki. I'll let you know when I find it.",

I ordered the Sunday Turkey, Gravy, and Stuffing Special, with mashed potatoes and corn as the sides. I was offered bread and said yes. The bread was stale and cold. As I waited over 20 minutes I admired the dirty floors and rude servers. My dish was finally delivered and looked like a mound of gravy, and was cold. I asked to have it reheated and was given a not-so-friendly look. Once I was able to dive in the stuffing had no flavor and was so soggy.

So much to choose from!!  Great breakfast anytime of the day.  And not to forget the dessert case!!  So many delicious things you just have to get a couple!  But my favorite is to get the basket of onion rings with ranch dressing for an appetizer.  I ususally try to go on a Saturday night.  One of their specials is chicken pot pie and I love it!!!  The service there is always on point and wonderful!  If you're in the need for some good, naughty food stop in and check it out!",

Maybe its just culture shock after spending the last year in Japan and coming back on vacay, but geez, I wasn't expecting an entire watershed's worth of seafood when I ordered the fried flounder and calabash shrimp platter. I found it a bit on the bland side, but nothing the tartar sauce couldn't fix. The onion rings were also bland on the flavour front, maybe they should spice the batter they use a bit more. Fries and slaw were okay as sides, but given the H-U-G-E amount of food that I ended up with I really couldn't get too excited about it.  I couldn't manage to get dessert down at the restaurant but I got a slice of carrot cake to go and that was excellent the next day.  Three stars tentatively due to that delicious cake, and since its probably my fault for ordering fried seafood at a diner instead of actual diner food, but I'm saving my first back to the US burger for Cookout.",

While eating at home something tasted funny.  So I spit out the bit that I had in my mouth and looked close at the pie.  This wasnt a tiny piece of mold it was over a 1/4 inch thick.  Called the restaurant and asked to speak to manager.  They were gone for the day.  I asked one to call me back and still have not recieved a call back.  That was 3 days ago.",

    "text": "Landmark Diner is a truly exceptional establishment! Having lived in New York for several years I am a total diner addict, and when I walk into Landmark I am transported back to New York. Landmark prepares food comparable to the great diners I frequented back then, with a super affordable price point--less expensive than other Charlotte diners!  For me, diners always mean breakfast, whether its morning, afternoon, or night! Landmark offers all of the traditional breakfast fare, i.e. various egg preparations, pancakes, home fries, steak and eggs, but then expands the menu with more creative options. On my first visit our server recommended challah french toast, a thick cut slab of challah bread, coated in a seasoned egg mixture and cooked to perfection on the stovetop. The dish was fabulous; the bread was golden and crispy on the outside and melt-in-your-mouth gooey goodness inside. My partner ordered pork chops and eggs, which were perfectly cooked, succulent and flavorful.  Landmark Diner was featured on Guy Fieri's TV series, \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives,\" and it is very clear why the producers selected this spot. The food is delicious, the portions are huge, and the prices are surprisingly affordable. Landmark Diner absolutely made its mark on me, as I have a new Queen City favorite!",

Ive noticed employees being on their cellphones when business is busy. Alot of the staff dont appear happy to be at their job and it shows in their interaction with customers. Ive heard them gossiping and being unprofessional when I've gotten takeout. It kind of sucks because Landmark WAS one of my favorite places to dine, especially with the homemade deserts but I prefer not dining at a place with front end staff that are so unprofessional.",

My favorite was the pancakes. The reason i say \"decent\" is because my eggs were a little dry and my bacon a bit over cooked.   All in all, i think I'll come back.

I ordered an eclair on a late-night dessert run and the thing came to me on a full-size dinner plate.  2. They are open until 4am. In Charlotte. No further explanation needed.  3. This place is great for people watching. Awkward teenage dates? Yep. Bikers? Of course. Little old ladies fanning themselves after church? Why not. And they are all welcomed and happily coexist at the Landmark.   Are you still reading? Haven't lost you yet? Well, why not? Stop it! Go to the Landmark.",

    "text": "I'm giving the Landmark 4 stars because of their delicious Mousaka. It took a while but that was because they made it fresh, and man was it YUMMY! One of the only places in Charlotte that serve Mousaka, which is the Greek version of Lasagna...only better (IMHO). Oh, and the Greek desserts were very yummy as well, like their Baklava.  But, what my Dad and Wife had were just OK, nothing special. I warned my Dad about ordering Pastrami from a non-Jewish deli, and sure enough, it was not very good. Somewhat dry. My wife had the Chicken Souvlaki which were decent but not great.  They have a large menu and I will try something different next time just to see what else they do.  But if you go, go GREEK! That Mousaka was oh so very delicious!",

It is a great place for someone who's not sure what they want to eat, as they have all day breakfast, Italian, seafood, burgers, deli sandwiches, steaks, soups, turkey dinners, etc. The staff is always amazing and incredibly friendly. We have never had a bad server. If you are someone who likes desert, this needs to be a destination point. There is a whole case of cakes and the slices are gigantic. Not a fancy place, but great for those who love diners.",

    "text": "I'm pretty dang excited to have discovered Landmark. Why? Well, come with me as I explain.  Landmark is not quite within the borders of the trendy part of Central Avenue. You shouldn't let the fact that its in a less exciting area deter you, however. Not that people seem to be deterred. When we went for Sunday brunch, there was an amazing mix of customers (as others have noted). Old ladies in church clothes, hipsters in Chucks, families with kids, and all of a range of ethnicity and color. This, to me, is an excellent sign.   Inside, the place is nicer than you'd expect. It's not fancy by any stretch of the imagination, but it's clean, the decorations are fairly tasteful, and it's spacious. We were promptly seated and served drinks, and service was excellent throughout our meal.  Of course, you're probably more interested in the food than the clientele, decor, or service. Well, you're in luck, because it was quite tasty. I ordered the Farmer's omelette, which included sausage, bacon, and tons of veggies. It was delicious. The biscuit that came with it was done right as well. The only \"meh\" note were the home fries, which, despite being nice and crispy, were slightly bland. Salt and pepper helped. Yeah, the food isn't word class, but it's plentiful, tastes good, and is cheap. I can't wait to go back and pick something out from that huge dessert case.  All of the above are excellent reasons to give a restaurant four stars. What pushes me all the way to five? They're open at 4AM folks. 4AM. If you live in Mint Hill, you'll understand why it makes me so happy to have a place fairly close by, open late and serving good food, that's not Cookout.  4AM!",

Of course, when in Rome, do as the Romans do, so I ordered a gyro platter. Delish. We also got the stuffed grape leaves appetizer and honestly, that was big enough for a meal.

I ordered buffalo chicken wings with ranch & cheese grits. The wings came out dry with the sauce on the side which was odd to me because I didn't ask for them that way. The buffalo wing sauce was not good at all. It was VERY salty with a bad after taste. The ranch was bland so it didn't mask the bad sauce taste. The cheese grits were average. I've heard the omelettes are great, but overall I was pretty underwhelmed.",

The host was a pleasant gentleman who was very responsive and courteous. Went here with a  party of five yesterday for an after graduation meal. The menu remains a typical NY/NJ diner style BIG menu with plenty to choose from but what is coming off of the menu is definitely not worthy of a decent NY/NJ diner.  Two of us order breakfast, two order lunch meals and one ordered a sandwich. No one was satisfied. Coffee was barely luke warn, egg selections were burnt because of their grill being too hot. The sausage links we burnt and chewy because they were cooked hours previously and just re-heated. One had a Philly cheese steak sandwich which was totally flavorless. Another had beef tips over rice that tasted like Uncle Ben's rice. All this and a waitress with a crappy attitude.  Sorry Landmark... time for us to find another \"Go to\" place.",

We got there and got seated really fast, it was not crazy like some restaurants where there is a huge line you have to wait and our waitress was super nice and attentive. She helped me look thru the menu since I couldn't find what I was looking for (the spanakopita). Now to the food, WOW! so much better than I expected. So GOOD!!! I loved every single thing. I got the spanakopita with a Greek salad and broccoli. Those portions are HUGE! I thought I had ordered an extra salad by mistake lol. The salad was delicious! With the most delicious feta cheese and fresh veggies. Then my main meal came, I couldn't be happier! My boyfriend had a gyro and he said it was one of the best he's had. Portions where also great. We got the check and loved what we saw. Half of the amount we usually pay while eating out, and we liked this place so much better. I'm giving it 5 stars. Amazing service, food and prices!!!

I ordered the Italian trio which was fettuccine alfredo, chicken parmesan, and a piece of lasagna. Everything was delicious and here they don't skimp out on portion sizes. I was so full I had to take half of it home. However, (please take this tip)save room for dessert! We ordered the huge slice of chocolate cake which was rich, moist, and simply delicious!

I would have rather had a little slaw but the tartar sauce was good.  The sweet potatoes were really great.  My meal costed me $8.12.  That is a good price for what I received.     On a side note:  The desserts at this place are on a completely different level.  I have come here before just for dessert!  They have a cooled display case with lots of freshly made cakes and greek desserts and even pastries.",

They are all good too. I've had just about everything here from the italian trio to every blue plate special. Places like this also seem to have the best ranch and that's True for here. I love dipping the fried squash in some good homemade ranch dressing. It does get super busy so I tend to go not during the rush hours. I also get take out here often. Call ahead and it's ready when you arrive. The staff is always super nice and it does feel like home every time I go in. Thanks Landmark!",

    "text": "Reasonable prices. Good atmosphere. Friendly staff. Large portions. This is pretty much the basis of the restaurant. I was very excited when I found out Guy Fieri from DDD had dined here and filmed it on his show. After I ate the food I was disappointed. The only issue I had with the food was that it did not have enough flavor. I had to add salt to make the food taste like anything. I ordered the Chicken Cordon Bleu with green beans and mashed potatoes. The chicken cordon bleu did not need any additional seasoning. As a matter of fact that was the best thing on my plate. The concession around the table was pretty much the same, the food is lacking flavor.   The green beans were terrible. Aside from them not having any flavor they had something like tomatoes, onions and maybe a potato in the mix. It was too much going on in the green beans for me to enjoy. The mashed potatoes needed salt too but I think they had a few mushrooms pieces in it so I didn't have to add a whole lot of salt to the dish to make it better. We did not order any desert but based on what was on display it looked like it might have been good. Even the display pieces looked like a good sized portion. I was in North Carolina  for the day and decided to give Landmark a try. After this visit I have decided when I do come back into town I will try another establishment.",

    "text": "Mixed Bag on both Food and Service  My wife and I have been here once before years ago but in the mood for diner food so we decided to give it another try. Last time as I remember was very good.  This time turned out to be a mixed bag, Some items were beyond the control and the restaurant, the other part well within their control.  It's a popular restaurant and they share a parking lot in a small strip mall with other stores so parking is woefully inadequate. Say people not only double parking but in some cases, triple parking. Ended up dropping my wife off to get in line while I parked next door in the Darby Acres  Shopping Center Parking lot and walking over.  When I walked in, my wife told me there was a 20 minute wait which was OK.  Seating for those waiting for a table or a take out order is limited so be prepared to wait.  The 20 minutes turned out to be pretty close to actual and frankly I was expecting longer. We were seated at a small table on the other side of the divider from the counter which was OK.  Small but still was able to put my crutches in a place where they were out of the way and did not impede other diners.  Server was there shortly with menus and to take our beverage orders. My wife ordered just water and I went with  1/2 and 1/2 Sweeten Tea which was still too sweet. Hate to thing what regular sweet tea taste like.  We had looked over the menu on line before we came so we pretty much knew what we were going to order.  My wife order the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich which is one of her favorites. Came with Fries but for $.50 more you had the option of upgrading up to Onion Rings which she did.  I ordered the Roast Tom Turkey over Dressing which came with a Salad and a Side. Tried to order a Baked Potato but that was not one of the listed sides so went with Potato Salad along with the Salad which I got with an Italian Dressing.  The Salad came out shortly along with Bread which was pretty good. The Salad was good also but unfortunately I had to look at the aftermath through out the rest of my meal as demonstrated by the attached photos.  After I was finished and when my main course was served, I asked if she would remove the dirty dishes and all I got was \" in a minute\".  Asked again another time but in the end, I ended up looking at these dishes throughout our stay.  Entrees in or themselves were good and portion were huge. My wife loved her Philly Cheese Steak and Onion Rings and because the portions were so large, ended up taking some home.  My Tom Turkey was also good and ended up taking some home as well. Problem was the Mustard Salad which was suppose to be Potato Salad. Could not taste anything beyond the mustard and my lips were still burning 30 minutes after I left the restaurant.   Mustard is suppose to be a subtle addition to Potato Salad and suppose to accent the dish. It's another thing to overwhelm the dish to the point that that is all you can taste and 30 minutes later, your lips are still burning.  Final problem as on check out and I did not catch this but my wife did. The $.50 upgrade to Onion Rings had become $.75. Not a big thing but became a big thing for my wife after watching dirty dishes for 20 minutes while we ate lunch.  Parking is beyond their control. Seating is within their control and they did a good job. The service including the implicit refusal to remove dirty dishes, inaccurate billing and inedible side dishes are well  within the control of the restaurant.  Some good points at the restaurant and a number of less than desirable so let's just put it this way, I've experience better and in may cases, a lot better.",

Landmark Diner is one of those places where if you can't find anything on the menu you like, well maybe you shouldn't go out to eat. Breakfast, burgers, Greek specialties, seafood, Italian, good 'ole home cooking- seriously, they have it all. When you walk in the door, you'll see a board of specials. Pro tip: take a pic of it before you get seated.  I don't have a go-to menu item here because I'm usually craving something different each time. The one constant is that I have to start with soup, both their vegetable and French Onion are delicious. Another big hit with our group are the apple sticks (not on the regular menu, check the specials board). Some of my other favs- pork chops, Greek combo, burgers, hot open turkey sammie (I'm a sucker for things covered in gravy).   If you are a dessert fan, make sure you check out their case. It's packed with all kinds of homemade cakes, pies, turnovers, and pastries. Too full after your meal? Order a dessert to go! (You'll thank me for that later)",

Then we ordered the strawberry cake and red velvet cake.  The red velvet cake was homemade, but the cake part of the strawberry cake was premade by a factory and dry.   The food was edible and comforty in a sense, but definitely not homemade.  I think they do have homemade menu items but I feel like one would need to go down the list and ask the waitress if each item is made from scratch in order to know if it should be ordered or not.",

Our party of four gave our name to the hostess to be placed on the waiting list, and crammed into a crowded foyer to wait to be called. After about an hour, we checked again with the hostess, who informed us that 'she called our name a long time ago'. They never took the effort to come into the waiting area to call us.  It just continues to go downhill from there. The service was slow, waitress looked tired, was unpersonable had a tired/angry demeanor.  Everyone working there looked like they hadn't been to sleep in the past 24 hours and projected a demeanor that they all hated their jobs. Empty water glass, and the list goes on.   Our breakfasts took 45 minutes to arrive. Food was hot, but Mediocre at best.  I won't be coming back. 2 hours of my time to eat an $11 omelette with hash browns and a coke served by a staff that just looked and acted miserable.  Even the cashier seemed apathetic. I wanted to get a dessert, but didn't feel like waiting for the tired stressed waitress to bring me one, and felt too uncomfortable to ask the cashier for one to go. I got the impression that they just would have been too bothered to box one up for me. I get better food, service and wait times at the Waffle House, which isn't saying much.  I should know better than to listen to a recommendation from that douche Guy Fieri.",

She was very impatience with us because it took my boyfriend a few minutes to figure out what he wanted. He finally did and she rudely told him what he wanted would be a bad choice and he would send it back. So he picked Viel parmasean and she told him we don't serve that and he needed to pick something else. He did and without a trouble. I ordered and a few minutes later she comes back and says they're out of what I wanted. So I quickly picked something else. Then we watched her serve and ask how everyone else around us was doing. We sat there for 30 minutes before she even refilled our drinks or even came by to check on us. Then after 45 minutes we finally get our food. The food was amazing. We loved what we got and enjoyed our meal. Towards the end we were finishing and we waited another 10 minutes before she even came by or acknowledged us to bring us boxes. At this point we watched everyone she served before and after us leave. She finally brings us our check after being there for an hour. We were polite and kind to her. Even after the multiple times she was beyond rude to us. The customer service and this waitress is TRASH. We came here to hopefully expect a better service after the third time. Well the third time isn't a charm and we will never step foot into this establishment again.",

    "text": "So this place was featured on the Food Network and I happened to be in this area of town, so went to check-it out.  The entrance to the place was a little tricky, I accidentally went to the shopping center next to it and they are not connected, but I quickly corrected that.  The restaurant seemed steady for lunch time, clean and very modern looking.  The menu is large, with a separate lunch menu and specials and sides given by the waitress.  On this trip, I ordered the turkey with corn and mashed potatoes as my sides; also cornbread and sweet tea.  It didn't take very long for food to come to the table, within' five minutes.  The turkey was laying on top of stuffing with cranberries in  a plastic container on the side, it had an impressive presentation.  The taste of the turkey was very good, and complimented well with the gravy it had on top; the stuffing was a tad sweet, so I added salt.  The corn was very fresh, while the mashed potatoes was okay.  The corn bread was a bit dry, so butter was necessary to eat with.  I did not try the cranberry sauce.  I had more than I could finished but ordered desert anyway, which was the strawberry cheesecake.  The cheesecake was very creamy and moist, which I liked, the strawberries though weren't very good, they were dark, dry, and crunchy; basically not fresh; I scrapped most to the side to finish off the slice.  The price for all this was very reasonable and I overall enjoyed the meal.  Worth going again.",

Honestly the only bad thing I can say about this place is that every once in a while you'll get a new server, most of them have been there for years, who is having a bad day and they won't be SUPER happy to see you. EVERY restaurant has this from time to time. Don't feel forced to eat the whole portion. Get a box and save room for a selection from their desert CASE. Literally 5ft+ tall 3-4ft wide selection of super tasty goodness from baklava to cake (5 layers ) to chess cake, chocolate strawberries, it is something you have to behold. Their menu is gargantuan and I've never had a bad meal. Not a steak lovers dream tho, and that's fine because I probably wouldn't eat anywhere else unless it was for an Asian cuisine.",

You got your regulars and then the crowd ever since the diner got highlighted on the Food Network.  The outside of the building is not much to look at, but it's what's inside that counts!  Parking can be an issue if the diner is really busy, but you can usually find a space pretty quick since their turnover is fairly fast.  My friend and I have our favorite waitresses and it's always exciting to figure out who's section we are sitting in.  Overall, all the wait staff is friendly and quick.  Each have their own personalities and it definitely adds to the charm of the diner.  The only thing I have not tried here is their desserts which are in a nice display case right when you get into the restaurant.  French toast on Challah Bread is awesome!  One of my favorite things to get for lunch (if I'm not feeling it for breakfast) is the Reuben.",

It's an expected offering, but with results that soar right on over ordinary. My husband, a steak purist, declared his ribeye 'the best I've ever had'. The flavor was perfect. I asked for a gravy biscuit that wasn't on the menu, but they made it anyway. It was good and very satisfying. I've sampled other menu items over the years and never been disappointed.   After the generous meal portions, if you have room for dessert, you pretty much can't make a bad choice.

We stopped in around 8pm two weeks ago, Saturday, January 2, 2016, for our third visit.  It was not packed and we waited about 3-5 minutes to be seated.  When our waitress appeared we gave her drink orders then I asked about the \"potato boat\" listed in the appetizer section of their vast menu.  I had asked about it on a previous occasion and was told both the first time and this time that it is like \"a warm potato salad\".  I was interested the first time we were there but chose the chef salad instead.  This time I chose to order jalapeno poppers and a potato boat while my husband ordered the beef tips.  We were served my tea and my husband's beer and then after waiting about 24 minutes the waitress arrived with plates of food.  She put down a plate with fried jalapenos and a plate that I could not tell what the product was and asked the waitress while she was serving my husband's plate what it was because I thought she had brought the wrong order.    My husband and I are pranksters and I thought he was maybe pranking me because the two brown and black lumps appeared to me to be blacked horse shit.  I mean, seriously, one was burned to blackness on the top with huge black chunks of material falling off of it onto the plate and the other was very close to the same.  They were two very dark brown, oblong masses that appeared to be burned to oblivion.  This was NOT warm, or cold, potato salad or potato salad of any kind.  When the waitress advised these were potato boats I said that this was not warm potato salad and laughingly asked if she was part of the prank my husband was playing.  She said no and acted offended when I said I was not interested in eating that, that it was not what she described, and further, it was burnt to oblivion.  When I asked her if she would eat that she said \"NO!\". She huffed at me and said she would \"take care of it\", however, she left the plate of burnt horse shit or burnt shoes, whatever it was, on the table and walked off.  She came back in less than 7 minutes and picked the plate up and said \"I can take this away and you do not have to eat it but the manager said since you ordered it you have to pay for it\".  I just stood up and said I was not paying for that because it was nothing as described and it was burnt to oblivion and then walked out, asking the cashier if I could please pay for the food except for the burnt horse shit / burnt shoes.  He was clueless and just stood there with his mouth hanging open.  My husband was grabbing his jacket and coming out behind me.  I got to the vehicle and looked up and saw a short and chubby Hispanic or Greek looking teenager or young adult chasing him.  He got to their entryway and she blocked him from leaving by standing in front of him while he was calling me.  He said that she refused to let him out of the building and I advised him to turn around there was a door right behind him and if she touched him to protect himself.  My husband is a large man and could have seriously hurt this attacker.  I advised him I was about to call 911 because no restaurant can hold him against his will because I would not pay for burnt horse shit / burnt shoes that was supposed to be \"warm potato salad\".  When she realized that he was walking out she ran out behind him yelling and screaming, then behind my vehicle, while I engaged my firearm anticipating being physically attacked, and she collected my tag number and said she was calling the police.  She was smart enough not to stand behind my vehicle in an attempt to impede my exit.   This manager made a poor decision to behave this way.  Not only did I not pay for the burnt horse shit / burnt shoes, I also was not allowed to pay for anything else we ordered so they lost all of that money that night.  If that really was warm potato salad it seems to me that it would have been easier and more cost effective for them to take the alleged food back and save a customer.  We eat out more times than we eat at home and we really loved Landmark.  It could have easily been a very regular spot for us.  Their loss.  This is not the kind of restaurant I want to be a parton of.  What happened to the customer is always right?  I hope the manager enjoyed eating the burnt horse shit / burnt shoes.  No wait, I bet she didn't eat it.  In fact, I will bet no one ate it, whatever it was.  We waited for police when we arrived home but none showed.  I am appalled at the treatment and service we received at Landmark.  Not only did they serve me shit and treat me like shit, the manager could have very easily been physically hurt or killed when trying to kidnap my husband and then by chasing us in such a menacing way.",

It's a big restaurant with plenty of booths and tables, plus they have counter seating if you are looking for a quick visit. The menu is HUGE. They have all the classics of a diner like breakfast all day, Italian section and great burgers and sandwiches plus a Greek section and a seafood section larger than most restaurants. They don't skimp on the dressing for salads and I've never had wilted or so-so lettuce. I've tried something from every section of the menu except the kids part and I have yet to be disappointed. And service is great! My glass is never empty and they pull empty plates off the table through your meal. And the desserts are out of this world! Cheesecakes, 6 layer chocolate cake, strawberry cake, key lime pie, apple and cherry turnovers that take two people to eat. This is the place my other half and I go when we can't decide on where to go for dinner because we can each find something good every trip. The only negative I can point out is that they don't have country fried steak which is a classic diner meal...outside of that, one of the BEST restaurants in Charlotte.",

My bf ordered the chicken salad pita, I guess. He said it had no flavor and his fries were greasy. Baldie ate half of mine!  I ordered some kind of Philly Steak, I think. It was so memorable, as you can tell. It was good but it would've been better had it not tasted like the bread was toasted on a greasy, flat top. Again, french fries were greasy and tasted like they'd been fried in old oil. Honestly, I don't know who would think this place is so great. We gave it the benefit of the doubt and figured they'd do better with breakfast. No, its still a diner. Not a great one. I'm going back to Stack Kitchen.",

They've changed waiters and well, lets say the service is definitely not the same as it used to be.  For example it took at least 15 minutes to just get our water, and note that the restaurant wasn't busy at all. The waiter had only about 3 other tables and she already looked busy.   Another reason was that when I ordered a plate and wanted to share it with my mother because she wasn't so hungry, the waiter said they charged extra! What?!? What kind of restaurant requires you to pay extra to share?! We asked her that's the first I've ever heard of that, and she said she didnt want to get in trouble and to \"let it go\" and make it seem like we were wrong.   Sadly, I think it might be time for my business to go elsewhere as one of the best restaurants in my view has went in the gutter. It might not be the food, but service is definitely a deciding factor for my family and I.",

As much as that conference brings money to the city they should've been welcoming customers.   Word of advice Landmark if you don't want to be associated with CIAA \"affiliates\" you definitely don't need to be located on that side of town.",

I used to come fairly frequently as a kid, and didn't really appreciate what it was. When I came back recently, I was compelled to try the turkey and dressing by the same Triple D episode everyone's probably seen a dozen times. But it definitely doesn't disappoint. The portion they give you is so huge, the turkey and dressing get their own separate plate, while your sides get a second one.  I ate until I was stuffed, then brought home a box that probably weighed close to a pound. (And then I ate that like an hour and a half later because it was so good I couldn't get it out of my head.)  My family kinda hated their experience, because we had to wait FOREVER.  But, in Landmark's defense, it was a Sunday afternoon at about 1pm, and we had a party of six. I didn't mind waiting, and understood it. But if you're coming with a party much bigger than two, and you're not in a patient mood, you may want to choose somewhere else.",

I will get very very sick. I may die.   Landmark makes the best deserts in Charlotte and they are made in house. These are working man's deserts, chocked full of refined sugar and flour, steroids for diabetes. No fru fru half a bite macaroon eclair brule or whatever fancy nancys eat for an after meal treat.  My favorites are the tuxedo mousse cake and the tall chocolate cake. So I'm like that German kid from Willy Wonka and the chocoloate factory with chocolate all over my face. I don't care.  The regular menu is fairly hit or miss. The souvlaki and spanakopita are a hit. The fried chicken is a miss. The onion rings are a big hit, but the fries are not. It's weird yeah?  There are salads I guess, for joggers or those people who don't think they're gonna die or whatever.  It's open until 3 am.

The restaurant is very big, and when u first walk in there's a glass cabinet full of dessert that makes u don't want to ever leave the place. Not to mention it was famous for that in travel channel.  My bf ordered grilled chicken filet with sunny side up egg and fried potato. The fried potato was good, and has full flavor to it. Doesn't even need ketchup or honey mustard. However, the chicken is a bit too dried. It had good flavor just too dried.  I ordered the challah French toast as recommended by many yelp users. And oh god it's anything but classic French toast. First, the size of the toast is huge!! It's very fluffy and not overly sweet even after I pour half bottle of maple syrup to it. By the way, the syrup was Warm!!! That makes the toast even better.   The portion was so huge, we have leftover for lunch and dinner. The only thing I take a star off is for the server. She literally didn't check on us after she dropped off the food.  It's a place we will definitely go back, especially for brunch and late night munches",

    "text": "First off, I know it's kinda dumb... but I took away one star based upon the size of your menus. They are ridiculous. The menu is at least 2 feet tall and 2 feet wide. I couldn't see my fiance while we were both trying to decide what to eat, I got a neck cramp trying to see her over my menu. If this gets fixed I will give you a 4 star :) Service was fast and friendly. The food was decent. The broccoli cheddar omelette and home-fries my fiance got were on point. I had the Philly Melt, and to be honest, I was disappointed. You will be able to find pictures of what we ate if you check the restaurants images. My Philly Melt LOOKED amazing... it had a lot of cheese,,,  the cook even obliged and added grilled onions, and mushrooms. BUT it all tasted pretty bland. The meat itself didn't melt in your mouth like I expect a real Philly to. The meat was't BAD, just not tender enough to be legit. I didn't enjoy the batter on the onion rings, maybe they needed to change the oil. I picked up a baked treat on the way out. All of there baked goodies looked freshly made.",

    "text": "I have not been to Landmark in a few years, so I was excited to come back and try it again. As luck would have it, I even got to go twice in the same weekend.  FOOD I think the menu is too extensive and really wish they would cut it down. If you have never been to the Landmark before, it can be a challenge choosing what to get. I had a Greek chicken dish the first night and the pizza burger. Both tasted great, and the pizza burger was definitely unique.I tried the chocolate cake and key lime pie for dessert. Both were excellent.  PRICE The prices are fair. Expect to pay $10-ish for dinner and around $3-$5 for dessert.  SERVICE The first night that I went the service was a tad slow, but other than that, it was fine. Our server was very friendly and seemed to really enjoy his job. Had I not gone back to Landmark, I might have ended my review wondering why people complained so much about Landmark's service. The second night the service was just...strange. My friend ordered some soup and chicken strips, and our server promptly asked if he had eaten the chicken strips before. He stated he had and liked them, to which the server exclaimed how nasty they are. Sorry, lady, but that's not something you tell a customer when the customer has said he enjoys them. The server then brought my friend's soup out and immediately exclaimed how plain and gross soup is and how she does not eat soup. This didn't end here, though. When I ordered my dessert, I had the joy (that's sarcasm) of hearing our server talk about how she hates dessert. I asked her what she likes and she just responded \"food\". Ya, I would never have guessed that human beings actually like food.  Well, I'll be back and would certainly recommend Landmark, but they need to hire some additional servers and do a better job at interviewing and selecting servers.",

They were so busy that even though the menu is huge food must be fresh.   I had the lasagna, Dan the spaghetti and grilled chicken. Good diner eats ... BUT the baklava... Eat it!",
