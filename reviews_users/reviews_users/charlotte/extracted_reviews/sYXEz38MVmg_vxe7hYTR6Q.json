The sushi is the best I've had in awhile - super fresh tasting! The hibachi entrees are reasonably priced for the amount of food you get with them - we always have leftovers. The service is ok - seems like they only have 1 waitress and they tend to be very slow and not very attentive. Overall, the staff is very nice though. Only thing I'd change is the lack of music in the restaurant - most of the time when we dine in we're the only one there, and without music or tv noise the place is almost awkwardly silent lol",

Some of their food is out of the box frozen like the crab Rangoon instead of made to order. I asked the waitress and she told me it was frozen.  The ginger salad was terrible because the ginger sauce was bad. Salad lettuce was browning. If you have options, I say pass.",

My tofu was the soft kind not cooked enough - it basically fell apart whenever I tried to pick it up. The noodles were udon, not ramen. The veggies were cut haphazardly (appearances do matter).  Flavor was okay, but definitely not good. I won't go back.",

The salads came out, and almost immediately the soup and our main courses were brought to the table. The timing could use some improvement.

So I ordered Teriyaki shrimp noodles with mushrooms and zucchini lunch special. Easy enough right? NOT EXACTLY...Spent half my lunch break waiting 25 minutes!!  What's worse is it was like this each of the two or three times I've been in. Staff seemed so nonchalant and complacent with no sense of urgency. What's the deal!?! From what I can see you could use the business. There are comparable restaurants like Thai Taste, Chen Fu, etc 5 minutes away that manage EXTREMELY BUSY lunch crowds AND complete a carry out order in 10 minutes or less. Never again Tin Tin!!

I asked to speak with management he placed Alyssa on the phone. Alyssa was the young girl who took my order. I asked her was she the manager she said no. Very unprofessional to put a server on the phone when I clearly asked for a manager. A very extremely rude man got on the phone. He refused to give me his name and before I could even explain the reason for the call. He said what do you want then hung up on me! I called back and a young female answered the phone and she said you just called. I said, yes I did and I told her the manager was very rude and he hung up the phone. I told her I spend so much money here and this is the way the company treat there loyal customers. I told her since he wants to be rude to me.

Now grant it, she walked up to three or four guys ordering at the bar/checking out....as she walked past us standing there. The lady's response was ,\"just wait a minute.\" My wife asked again and the lady gave the same response. I asked my wife loud enough for everyone to hear if she wanted to eat her. She said no and we left. We went to Persis Biryani Indian Restaurant instead which was on the other side of the parking lot. When I got there I called Tin Tin and asked to speak to a manager. I was told they didn't have one. Persis staff was very polite. When we walked in they said ,\"welcome.\" They were polite during our $34 lunch. Hey, I spent more because they were polite. Tin Tin, your food is good but work on your staff's courtesy. That lady could have said, I'll be with you in one moment ma'am instead of saying, just wait a minute.

We thought the ramen and udon noodles were cooked perfectly. The only reason I can't give Tin Tin Cafe a 5/5 is that we had imitation crab in our soups. Give it a try! I hope to see you there.",

I am a pescatarian so obviously i needed to have my food sent back. So i proceeded to ask to speak with the manager and the waitress brought the manager over to my table. i told her that my food tasted like chicken and she says \"it's obviously not chicken it's salmon and even if it was it was suppose to be tuna. i then asked her if she was in the back when they put my food together and she says \"no, but i know what it's supposed to be and it's not chicken\". at this point i was so over it and i want my money back so as she walks off she says \"if you don't know how to order sushi then don't get it, that's common sense\"  in no way was i rude to her for her to use that manner with me. By the way, her name was (ay-leen) i'm not exactly sure of the spelling but she was a manager. The prices was not worth the disrespect and the food was sub par.",

I hate writing reviews (unless they're bad ) but wanted to make sure to make people aware of this relatively new restaurant.

To start, the place was absolutely empty at 8:30, so finding a seat was super easy. We were greeted and sat at one of the many booths in this place. Seriously, there's a lot of booths! Throughout the restaurant, you'll see a ton of colorful decor, making this place stand out from most sushi spots.   Once sat, the waitress took our order and that's when the excitement began! Despite a few hiccups in service from our server, the sushi rolls hit our table on a lovely white serving dish. After we cleared that dish, we added another couple of rolls to the mix. You know, just to confirm that the rolls were as good as we thought - for the accuracy of this review. No major complaints about the food, as all of the rolls we had were good to great!   One of the biggest negatives that I found with this place was their \"30% off\" offering... Why?! The food is plenty good to not tarnish the brand with silly discount signage in the front windows. The service could have been better, as we had to ask for some items on more than one instance. All in all, a good experience that I'd definitely return for.",

    "text": "Great new restaurant in the University area. The sushi is very good, and the ramen is quite good as well. One of the best in Charlotte - and pretty much the only decent ramen in the University area.   I've been there a few times as well as ordered sushi takeout. The sushi has been good each time. I've only ordered the ramen once, but it was quite good. The noodles won't hold up to takeout though so if you're ordering it to go I'd suggest substituting with a sturdier noodle when you order.  The exterior of the restaurant itself is in an unassuming strip center, but the inside is very nice so don't be fooled. The service is friendly, though the sushi can take a little time when you order it, but always worth the wait. They have wifi available through TWC so if you are already a TWC user you can easily get online.  They really have an interesting menu, but I've found it hard to tear myself away from the sushi long enough to try many other items. So far my favorites are both the Spider Roll and Spider Man Roll as well as the Crazy Hot Roll. I can't wait to sample my way though other options. There are a variety of hibachi and noodle dishes as well as some Chinese and others.",

    "text": "Two of my friends and I tried this place shortly after opening for lunch. None of the lunch specials appealed to any of us. The lunch specials also seemed expensive, closer to $10 or more. In my mind if you are offering a lunch special it should be $6-$8 (I know $2 isn't going to make or break that many of us, but it's the principle!).   Two of us got a sushi roll and a side salad. My other friend got a larger sushi platter. The food was all right, but the rolls seemed to be on the smaller side. My friend who got the sushi platter was disappointed with the fish as well. Honestly when the bill came, it seemed really expensive for what we got. I feel like they were trying to be a fancy sushi restaurant but offering low-budget quality food   The restaurant opened in a space of the strip mall that has been vacant for YEARS. I was excited to see something go in there finally. They did a really good job with the decor and you can tell they thought about trying to create a cool atmosphere. However, my guess is that this place will not last that long if they don't try to capture more of a lunch crowd and offer some better deals.",

Their sushi is very fresh and they offer creative rolls.  Their jalapeno on their rolls is on FIRE so be warned.  Their lunch specials are super cheap.  I ordered hibachi chicken last time since it's cheaper than the veggies.  The chicken was good, but I regretted not getting veggies.  I'm just not that into chicken and I was just trying to save a few bucks.  I will be going back to my veggies this week for sure!  Their spring rolls are delicious and I burn my most every time because I just can't wait to eat it!  Service is usually good, but it took us forever to get checked out.  I will bring cash the next time as a result.  All in all, TinTin is great!  Be sure to peep their decor, especially the bathroom.  Interesting to say the least!",

Stood there for about 6 minutes before reaching the front of the register just to let them know where waiting to be seated. Once we got seated it took around another 5 minutes to get a drink.   The waitress took our orders without writing them down, then continued to confirm our order as she brought out our drinks and appetizers. Would have been easier if she would have written it down.  Sushi was wonderful, and the volcano salad was probably my favorite. I ordered the stir fry shrimp udon noodle. Large portion for the whole family.

By the time they came to our table we were ready to order but she needed more time to attend her other tables.

So this is a place you can get a lot for not much of a cost. I have yet to have a bad roll from Tin Tin. My personal favorites are the Tin Tin roll, Tiger Roll, Tornado Roll, Shiki Crunchy Roll, NC roll, and Shrimp crunch roll. And because it is buy one get one, you can sample a lot of different rolls to find out which one you like best. Their appetizers are also tasty and worth a try. They also have $4 chicken hibachi and you can choose what you want in it. Overall this is a great quality restaurant that won't break the bank.",

A friendly gentleman (I assume the owner or manager) seated us right away. He came back to the table a minute later and we ordered drinks and the crab rangoon. He came back five minutes later and took our sushi order. 20 more minutes passed and we wondered where the crab rangoons were. When the gentleman approached, he had our sushi. As he set it down, we let him know the crab rangoons never came. He told us he would check on it and that they only take \"two minutes\" to come out. Less than five minutes later, they were brought out. I'm pretty sure they weren't put in until we reminded him.   As for the food taste and quality- I'd definitely say skip the rangoons. We didn't even finish them because their was NO crab in it. None. Tons of cream cheese but no crab. We did, however, like the sushi. My fiance ordered the Smokey Salmon Roll and the NC Roll. I ordered the Sunrise Roll and Rising Sun Roll (I think that's what they are called). Next time I would skip the carrot that was in one of them but they were pretty good - especially considering the buy one, get one free deal.   Side note: the specials posted in the windows on project board paper doesn't look great. Makes it seem run down when the inside isn't that bad.   Overall, I would say it's a decent spot for sushi but not the best place around.",

    "text": "Do they deserve 4 stars, no, but I still feel bad with 3.  3.5 seems right.  Its your nothing special cheap Japanse Habachi kind of spot.  A dime a dozen.  They weren't very busy, but its an interesting location and I was a little later than the average lunch time.  FYI, there is another similar spot .5 mile away.  But this place has much nicer decor.  They tried and the food wasn't bad.  It wasn't super awesome that the lady behind the register was talking on a cell phone and not really paying me attention when I tried to order, but hey, I was on hold on a cell phone as well.  I guess its just the way we live these days.  The Hibachi combo for less than $5 gets 4-5 stars for value.  That's the only reason I gave them a chance instead of Bojangles though.  Rice, a veggie and a spring roll.  A great deal.  The chicken was kind of pale and didnt' have a good sear to it, but still tasted fine and had decent texture.  It is what it is.  Would I go hear if looking for a nice meal.....  Probably not.  Would I give it another shot relying on value....  Will do.",

    "text": "I went here all the time during college last year and I will say it's hard to beat the BOGO deal with what are mostly larger sushi rolls. BUT do not come here if you're in a hurry or already really hungry. It will take forever to get your food and there was only one waitress that was ever kind to me. The rest would ignore me or have an arrogant and rude demeanor. This would only add to the time for our order to be taken because they would walk past us even when we were the only customers there! I have had much better sushi but it will satisfy a sushi craving on a budget.",

    "text": "My family and I have been ordering food from Tin Tin Cafe for several years.  Tonight was the WORST experience ever!! My daughter ordered calamari for takeout and when we got it the portion was not what you would expect for the price we paid.  My wife called to let Tin Tin know how disappointed we were in the order, which they remade for us, but when I picked up the second order the young and immature cook had the  audacity to come from the kitchen in SLIPPERS to confront me in front of my daughter about the amount of calamari that was cooked.  Very unprofessional and BAD REPRESENTATION of staff for this restaurant.  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Tin Tin Cafe to evaluate their staff/family before given them a position within the restaurant.  I would also recommend that Tin Tin Cafe to do there homework on BEST PRACTICES for how a restaurant treat customers as well.  Homework lesson #1:  Never let cookers come out to communicate with customers in bedroom slippers, White T-shirts and track pants. (customers can't take those individuals seriously)  Homework lesson #2: only allow managers and waiters to mitigate customer issues or someone who has the intellect of an adult.  Homework lesson #3: Be willing to take criticism when your quality of food isn't at the base standard for a restaurant.",

    "text": "I stopped by with a few friends who invited me to go out to eat with them. I've never actually gone out exclusively for sushi before, so my opinion might not mean as much as somebody's whose has tried a lot of different sushi places. The restaurant itself is nice on the inside. It has a bunch of cool LED lights on the walls and the ceiling. I ordered the tempura California roll and the spicy tuna roll. The wait was a little long (30 minutes or so) considering we were one of two or three other tables seated at the restaurant, and the dishes came out one-by-one instead of all at once, but the sushi itself was good. The two rolls were buy one get the cheaper one free. It cost about $9 and change in total, and it was just enough food. I'll be back to try other kinds of sushi.",
