Choose from set bowls or build your own. I tried Seoul Poke Bowl in South End a few weeks ago - and felt Umami's proteins and ingredients were higher quality. Both are delicious options (don't get me wrong) and healthy alternatives to mayo laden sushi rolls. Same flavor without the fat.  My mom and I split three different bowls: the Sunrise, Tuna Poke and veg-friendly tofu bowl. We loved the peanut sauce on the tofu option. The sunrise had an amazing pickled daikon topping. She and I fought over the last bite! I was also a fan of the seaweed salad accompanying the tuna bowl. We could not pick a favorite - everything made for a delicious balance of fishy goodness!   I echo the similar anecdotes from reviewers on customer service. The owner and workers are incredibly kind, grateful and friendly. They walked us through menu items, answered questions with ease and were genuinely thrilled to serve us.  Umami PokeRito will definitely be a staple in my family's takeout rotation. Love it!",

Perfect place if you prefer healthy food, price for burrito is not so high, you can get your own wrap, order was really fast we waited only few minutes, I believe not more than 5- that's was surprise. All ingredients is fresh and organic, cook was so friendly and nice. Just one recommendation add more different drinks to menu. Thanks, I'll see you again.",

I was driving around one day and noticed the Umami Pokerito sign. My long held hope of eating a sushi burrito was finally within reach! I was greeted by an awesome staff. The restaurant is super clean with a great atmosphere. I ordered the miso chicken sushi burrito. Amazing!! I will definitely visit Umami Pokerito again. I hope to try all of their sushi burrito combinations. I highly recommend this experience.",

The food came out fast and the service was great. Not to mention the food was  fresh and delish!   Now a few pointers for the future since they're still new: I wish they'd offer a regular and large size bowl (for those with a bigger appetite.. uh me haha) and more seating. We had to wait for people to leave and sat next to strangers. Oh also, it'd be nice if there were a soda fountain machine too. It was kinda odd having a limited drinks selection with unfamiliar names  The ambiance is great and definitely making this place our go-to place for our sushi fix. The staff is super friendly and the variety is fairly large and fairly priced. You'll definitely be seeing a lot of me at this place!",

We thought the idea of sushi burritos was fun and innovative and we love sushi...and Mexican food (though there's a severe lack of great Mexican food in the Carolinas - do yourself a favor and get you some carnitas and tortillas from Lupitas near Tryon instead).  Anyways this review is strictly based on what we had the one time we went. We each got a burrito sushi and...well, it just didn't seem right. I felt like real sushi was judging me for what I was doing. It was hard to eat and I didn't like the overpowering taste of the seaweed. I probably should've tried the tortilla version? Maybe they're great for regular sushi.   The design of the place is nice and modern but the seating is very limited and communal tables and as introverts - no like.   I was going to give them 2 stars based on my meal, but will give them the benefit of the doubt that their Normal sushi is much better.",

Lou is a proven chef and a very personable guy who knows what's he's doing. Incredible visionary who's open to suggestions to improve the product. It's very nice to see West coast ideas move to Charlotte. We don't live close but it's definitely worth the short drive out. Will be coming back soon.",

They both tasted amazing and the portion sizes were great! We also got the squid salad that was good as well.   I do wish they had a more child friendly menu--perhaps some regular white rice and some chicken or something. And I agree with the other review--they have a very sparse amount of seating but they do have a sign saying they are working on adding more seats! I highly recommend this place! And I'm so happy poke is becoming more popular!!",

We shared the tuna tacos, Tahitian shrimp salad, tuna roll, and chomex roll.  We were blown away about how perfect the flavor profiles complimented each other.  The tuna tacos were crispy, salty, smoky, and full of umami.  The won ton type shells were not greasy at all like many restaurants mess up.    The Tahitian shrimp salad was fantastic, it was perfectly balanced lightly sweet, tangy mango, rich shrimp, and a nice savory bite from the onion. The tuna roll and chomex roll had perfect ingredients to tie in all the flavors and textures.  I was really blown away by the mix of textures and flavors.  Also, the quality of fish really stood out compared to anything I've had in the Charlotte sushi scene.  I think we are lucky to have a place like this in CLT, I hope they open more locations.    Run don't walk to try this place, the lines are worth the wait!",

Food is super fresh and flavorful with a nice variety of options (either chef specials or build your own like I did) to please my demanding palette. Poke sauce was incredible. They even provided me an off menu chili sauce because I wanted a lot of spice. My mouth is still watering thinking about it the day after, almost went back for lunch. Really nice staff and the place is spotless and minimalist with good ambiance for fast casual. It feels authentic, not chain-like. The owner brings what apparently west coast people have been enjoying for years to Charlotte - thank you!",

I've tried 3 of their signature rolls/bowls and I've built my own. I have yet to be disappointed. My favorite so far was probably the tuna poke bowl. The only negative about the place is the limited seating that others have mentioned, but to be honest, the only time I have not been able to sit somewhere was on opening day (thanks to a group that was way past done eating but continued to hog the table!!! So frustrating when there isn't extra seating). Anyways, they definitely earn 5 stars and the price is right for a healthy, fresh, and good portion. My husband was surprised the rice wasn't hot but I didn't even notice... He also still thought his bowl was delicious. He doesn't like fish so he got the chicken with teriyaki sauce and loved the flavor.",

The fish was not as fresh as I'd hoped and the rice was a hard disappointing puck at the bottom of the bowl.  You had to use your chopsticks like an ice pick to free up the rice from their cold rigormortis. While we ate beside another couple at a communal table (whyyy!?!) we watched as the three guys behind the counter fumbled around in confusion. The food took entirely too long to come out for us and everyone else there. I wanted to love this place, I'd been following their progress for months on Facebook.  I grew disheartened each time their opening was pushed back again and again. Maybe they'll get their act together eventually. For us, there were too many different things wrong with this place and nothing worth going back for.",

Talk about excellent customer service. Once I arrived back to the office I took the first bite and immediately stopped everyone around me to tell them about how great this sushi bowl tasted.

    "text": "So let me just start by saying we(me and my fellow foodie at work) were looking for something to eat today and wanted something new.  We wanted sushi but were a little burnt out on our favorite spot Mr. Tokyo. I looked for something close that did takeout and stimbled upon this little gem.  Now I've heard of poke, but never went out to try it and and always thought pokeritos were going to be a bit overwhelming and was just a fad so I avoided it.  Boy was I wrong. I called in a build your own bowl and burrito for my friend and it was ready in about 10 minutes to pickup.  You can view the menu to see the options to customize the bowl, it was exciting to pick what I wanted like this. The chef reccomended the sushi rice as he said it was most popular, and I went with the Ahi Tuna because raw was on my mind.  I had it mixed with 5 items: mixed greens, jalapeno, red cabbage, tempura flakes and cilantro. Then I had it topped with seaweed salad and their in-house poke sauce. It looked amazing like the best salad I've ever gotten, for takeout I knew I was in for a treat. I mixed in a little of the offered soy sauce and wasabi and went to town.  You wanna talk about fresh? It was a foodies wetdream. The tuna was so flavorful and melted in my mouth and the combination of other flavors just meshed together perfectly. They really are on point with their sushi rice, some the best I have ever had. The whole bowl is eatable using chopsticks which was a major plus for me.  The sauce added so much unique flavor and combined with the soy and seasoning of the seaweed salad I was in heaven.  My buddy got a soy paper wrap with spicy tuna, seaweed salad, poke sauce and similiar items as my bowl and got one for his son who also works with us and they were both impressed so I'll definitely reccomend and try it next time. We brought menus for some coworkers and the whole office was jealous and wanted to try it from looks alone and everyone said it smelled amazing.  Me and my friend both agreed these gentelman know what they are doing and have it down pat. This is definitely going to be a weekly lunch spot for us now.  Bravo gentlemen, bravo.",

    "text": ".  Let me start by saying I am obsessed with sushi. Like wake up with a hangover still craving sushi. I can not believe it took me this long to try a sushi burrito!!!!   What you need to know: This was good sushi. It tasted fresh and was good quality and quantity.  I got a build your own burrito. Maybe being my first time I should have let the experts build it for me but I still was not disappointed. Ingredients included: seaweed wrap with brown rice, salmon, spicy crab, carrots, spring mix, avocado, cucumber, scallions, and seaweed salad. Served with yum yum and lemon ponzu sauce. It was the bomb!! Like a cross between a Summer roll and sushi roll! I felt like I got my money's worth and won't be hungry in an hour.   Only down side is that it did get a little messy at the end of the burrito but I've never shied away from a messy meal. Especially when it's this good.   I would definitely recommend for a quick meal!",

I have pretty high expectations for my sushi and was very pleasantly surprised at how fresh and tasty everything was!  My sister and I each got the Umami bowl (normally we'd get two different things to try/share each but the Umami bowl just looked so good, we couldn't resist). I was picking between that and zen because I really wanted shrimp tempura so just ordered a kid's order of shrimp tempura, gave some to my blw 10 month old and ate most of her shrimp :-P -- SO GOOD and surprisingly filling! My sister couldn't finish her bowl and I normally scarf poke bowls down and it was plenty of food.  For the price, how fresh the food was and convenience -- really can't be beat. Now I just need to find a similarly awesome place near takeout/delivery range of my house in ATL and I'll be one happy clam.",

I went for the Tuna Poke Bowl. Portions were generous, and my goodness! The flavors and textures were amazing. I wanted to eat 2 more bowls after I finished mine.   I went in intending to get the PokeRito, but the friendly staff member recommended the bowl to really be able to taste the filling. He explained that with certain orders, you sacrifice fillings for rice. I appreciated his suggestion on that and see how the PokeRito is more of a novelty.

There are two large tables, seats by the cooking area and some by the window.    I took my time viewing the menu and I decided to BYOB. I picked spicy beef as my protein with sushi white rice. I had red onions, cilantro, roasted corn and green onions with kimchi with a side of wasabi aioli sauce. We placed our order and sat down by the window. We didn't wait long at all. The food tasted really fresh. The beef was very good and tender. The toppings were good and added a nice texture with the rice. I wasn't crazy about the wasabi aioli but that's also because I don't really like wasabi. I asked the girl at the counter a suggestion and she suggested that. It wasn't a big deal, I was actually happy with it being as is. My husband loved his bowl and he did the BYOB as well. My only little suggestion is for better plastic silverware. The fork was constantly bending and it was super hard to try to get everything and it was hard to cut my steak with the knife since it was also bending back and forth. Other than that, I really have no complaints!",

    "text": "I am so excited and glad that charlotte is getting a good taste of umami! Usually places like this only exists in highly diverse cities. With that said, the sushi burrito i had was quite good, i only wish it had a bit more protein. I understand proteins are expensive, but i'd rather they charge $1 more or cut the nice bag with handle for takeout, and the plastic sushi takeout container. I think just a simple brown bag stamped with the restaurant's name, phone and address would have been adequate and effective. Plus, you have such a cool concept, why not market it? People can see me eating a sushirito and know where to get it themselves! Since the burrito is already wrapped well, there is no need for the extra sushi container.  Right now, the sushi burrito doesn't quite taste like a hand roll, it's too diluted. It leans more towards the flavor of a burrito. I would think it'd be better to lean more towards the taste of a hand roll to separate itself from chipotle and qdoba, don't get me wrong, even the set up of the restaurant looks like a chipotle/qdoba. Also the restaurant could do a better job of explaining what each of the japanese terminologies are, this would not only make the customer experience better, but make service faster. Lastly, the restaurant needs more seats, rather than the two big tables inside, i think they could place more small 2 people tables throughout, and then if there are parties with more than 2, they can put the tables together.  I will be back to try out their bowl, with some tweaks, this restaurant can definitely be 5 stars.",

My dad is currently eating vegan so we decided to come here to see what all the hype was about. You get to choose between making your own bowl/burrito or getting one that has a name and chosen ingredients. I decided on making my own bowl which consisted of sushi rice, teriyaki chicken (I can't stand raw fish), roasted corn, cucumber, lettuce, and tomato. My dad decided on getting veggie #1 in the form of a burrito. While we waited for our food to be done, we admired the professional, sleek, and modern setup of the restaurant. The only problem is that there aren't much tables so that might be a problem for lunch/dinner hour. I also wanted to mention that the staff were incredibly kind and on top of the game! Once we got our food, we were obsessed! It was fresh, filling, and quite delicious! It also made you feel energized and awake since all of the ingredients were fresh and healthy. I'll definitely come back to Umami PokeRito to enjoy their fresh and delicious food!",

The umami burrito looked delicious it had a decent amount of fish inside. Miso soup was also good but small.   Downsides are that seating is limited. The seats are metal stools with no back support. There is also a slim drink selection. They have bottled and tap water, unsweetened tea, hot tea, an uncarbonated soft drink and canned milk coffee.   Overall will be back again because we enjoyed it.",

Service was fast and the guy taking orders was super nice. Zen bowl is definitely my favorite. (for now)  the location is small, with only 2 tables to share. So if you're going in a big group just know you might not be able to eat inside. Everything is plated in to-go boxes though. Which I have no problem with. Found the to-go boxes really cute and easy to eat from. oh oh I also got the seaweed salad which was by far the best I've had in a while. Can't wait to try other locations. (was told each location has different styles)",

Its about $12 for a burrito that will fill you up vs if you go to a sushi place and play $10 for a roll with about 8 pieces. The idea is so cute and I love the food. This is definitely on my regular list of places to go now. Trust me you will enjoy it.",

You can also get the burritos in nori or a regular wrap. The Zen had spicy tuna, spicy crab, tempura shrimp, cucumbers, avocado, spicy sauce and a sweet sauce with rice. It was like a giant sushi roll. I really enjoyed it. Next time I might create my own.   The staff was friendly and explained the menu to me. The dine in area is a little small and there's stools to sit on. Prefer different seating but hey it's a fast casual place. I'll be back soon.",

I must admit that I had no idea what a sushi burrito was until I had their signature Umami Burrito today for lunch. Although a bit pricey for this retired teacher at $12.99, it was absolutely delicious and filling. My sushi-savvy daughter built her own of course and was very pleased also as very full.  Be warned though, the dining area only has a couple of four seat tables and about a dozen or so stools. There are also no fountain drinks offered if that matters to you. Finally, as I mentioned, it is pricey.  Our total bill for a couple of burritos and bottled teas came in at around $29, but here, you do get what you pay for.  Located beside Panera at corner of 51 and Carmel, parking is easy and the sanitary rating was a 95. I'll be back the next time my daughter is in town. It's close to a Gotta Try! 4.5 stars if Yelp allowed.",

You had to order at the counter, but you couldn't see what you were ordering it watch them make it for you like you can at most places.  I got mine with brown rice, Ahi Tuna, avocado, carrots, corn, green onions, cucumbers, mango, and sweet chili sauce. I enjoyed my bowl, but I wish I would have sampled the sauces before getting one because there sweet chili was a little too sweet for me. I thought the topping selection was a little smaller than some of the other places around town.   They have a very small number of tables there, but there was no one there when we were there.

I decided to build my own burrito. But there are plenty of great combinations that would be good for someone less adventurous or that wants to keep it simple.   The ordering is easy - you pick your protein, up to 5 toppings, add sauces and then you're done.   I decided to have the spicy crab and loaded it up with toppings and added some yum yum sauce. Guys, it was so good! I did a pretty darn good job.   The service here is very good, they gave me a tip for how to eat my burrito so it wouldn't fall apart and came by to make sure that I enjoyed everything.   I'm already looking forward to my next visit!",

This restaurant is very clean, the to-go utensils station is neat and organized. There's plenty of parking available in this shopping center.   If you're not familiar with Poke, there are other options available (vegetarian included). Just a heads up there are No Substitutions allowed with the Chef Signature menu items.   I choose to Build my own Poke Bowl,  my selection included: - Mixed Greens - Spicy Crab & Spicy Tuna  - Avacado  (no additional charge! omg) - cucumber -Carrot - Jalapeno - Red onion - Seaweed Salad - Cilantro -  The signature Poke Sauce (So Good)  Next time i'm going for the burrito!!",

Bowl was delish, fresh, super filling, and a nice sized portion. Under $10 (If you are ok with having only one protein, I thought this was a great deal!)",

    "text": "If you can imagine Chipotle and a high-end sushi restaurant got together and made a new restaurant, it would be the best way to describe the latest 'fast-casual' trend that's sweeping the nation.  I really didn't walk in here thinking I was going to love the \"Poke\" concept. Not that I had anything against it, but I've seen so many fads come and go that I wasn't sure if this was just the next \"Anti-Griddle Ice Cream\" or \"Customize your own pizza!\" Nope, this was something else alright, something much more refined and delicious.  When you walk into Umami, it's very minimalist. Maybe a bit too much as seating is very limited. At first glance, it appears that they anticipate that most customers will take their meal to-go. And after trying for the first time, it's a perfect to-go option! I still probably wouldn't mind eating in every once an awhile, just be warned that a half dozen or so customers and this place is pretty full. One more note on the inside, the bathrooms have been spotless the three times I've been here, wonderful!  So I have gotten the Umami Bowl twice and the Tuna Poke bowl once and I gotta say, the Umami Bowl is the perfect proportions of everything. The Spicy Crab could be a bit spicier if you ask me, but I just love how everything, down to the perfectly cooked/ cooled rice is so balanced and complements all the other components. The salmon in this bowl is top notch. The thick fat layers stand out beautifully and the texture is better than most sushi restaurants in town. All of this is really rounded out well with a slightly sweet \"yum yum sauce\", mellow avacado, and just the right amount bitterness with the mixed greens. I highly suggest getting this bowl as-is if it's your first time here.  My only minor complaint would be that the drink options are awfully limited, and only bottled offerings with high markups. If you are taking your meal to-go I would suggest to buy your beverage beforehand.  As far as the rest of the menu, I must say that I'm going to have to force myself to try new things as they have me hooked on the Umami Bowl. Can't wait to try bowl after bowl on their extensive menu with varying hints of cuisines!",

It was not the best poke experience I have had and I have no reference in the Charlotte area, but in Florida, this spot would be meh.  Probably will not return.",

Our kids had chicken teriyaki on white rice, I had the Umami burrito and wife had the spicy miso chicken bowl.  Our boys loved the teriyaki chicken - not too bold for kids.  We loved the combination of flavors and portion size is perfect... satisfying without feeling overly stuffed.  Staff & owner extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  Owner did say they are working on adding more seating however the theme is more of a \"food to go\" type.  Very cozy & laid back family friendly atmosphere!",

Do you like it spicy, then have it that way. Do you want steak instead of raw fish, go ahead. The place is perfectly suited for anyone's palate, but you have to know your flavor range. Spicy, bitter, sweet, tangy, etc.. They have it all. We've been several times and every single time, the dining area was spotless, no fish odors, and nothing messed up. The staff is courteous, helpful, interactive, and clean. Even if you're not adventurous, you should give it a go because they'll help you find something you can try...and it may end up helping you become more adventurous. We absolutely love this place. Support local businesses and restaurants!!",
