We were looking forward to a nice dinner with drinks and conversation with some ambiance. This place fell short, especially on the service. The facilities were pleasant and comfortable, the menu was typical standard fare, the food quality was average, and the service was poor. The server (Scott) did not seem to want our business - unfriendly while we were ordering, didn't bring our drink order - we had to ask someone else to follow up long after our food had been served, and then a while when he finally later he brought out drinks, he forgot one of the four we had ordered nearly a half hour before. After that he never came back to check on so refills. When he finally came by he groaned a single one surly word: Dessert? We had hoped to have a casual dinner with a couple of drinks or wine; but by the end with the unfriendly vibe from the waiter, we were happy to just pay the bill and leave. This place is not on the repeat list for me.",

The duck breast special was delicious.  Everything was just perfect, including the temperature of the red wine.  It was the perfect temperature, a little warmer than cellar temp, but not  a too warm 70+ room temp. Dining outdoors was delightful.  We will definitely be back soon.",

The cocktails were delicious - the South Park Old Fashioned was essentially a basic old fashioned but with rye and brown sugar... The Basil Smash was bright and not too sweet. Good wine list and a the bar area was lively. The main dining room was pretty loud but fun.  The lobster bites appetizer was disappointing - overcooked to the point if being chewy. The prime rib was really nice, whipped potatoes were cold when brought to the table but tasty. Had a taste of the gnocchi and the filet, both really nice.  Highly recommend sharing the chocolate cake.  Service was prompt and professional but you could definitely tell it was the last service on what had been a busy weekend evening.  I'll give it another shot.",

    "text": "Four of us went to SouthPark Grill at 6:45 on a Wednesday night. When we walked in, we noticed that the restaurant was not crowded.  The young hostess walked us to a back room, with no windows, and tried to seat us in the last booth in the room. We asked her if we could sit out front where the windows were, and she said all the booths were reserved for parties of six. The funny thing was, the booth we were standing by, while she checked with her manager, had only four women.  Not a good start... After finally being seated in the front room, we had a very nice male waiter.  He had a great personality and was very informative and courteous. He was training a new waitress, and she was also very courteous and personable.  Now to the food...I ordered a salad with grilled shrimp. It was ok, but basically all lettuce.  It had very light toppings and only three shrimp.  We ordered oysters Rockefeller which were a highlight. My friend ordered a rare cheeseburger, and it was medium at best.  Also ordered was a French dip sandwich, and it had very little meat and too much bread.  The French onion soup was good as were the grilled scallops.  The wine and service were both good.  So, with the seating problem, and the so-so food, we will definitely not return.  There are too many restaurants in Charlotte to come back to the SouthPark Grill.",

Dinner was delicious starting with the seafood tower, onto a beet salad and we each ordered separate dishes to sample and share; sea bass, filet and the shrimp gnocchi, rounding out the night with the chocolate cake!  The sea bass was the star of the evening.  Our server was great, but there was a little too much time from our drink orders and time to table.  I think that may have just been side effects of a crowded bar with live music no less on PGA tourney week.  All in all a really nice night!",

If 3.5 stars were an option, I would have rated it that, but didn't have the heart to do 3 stars due to management being nice and receptive. My main issue last night was our server. Myself, husband and another couple friend went to Southpark Grill and after being seated, it took a bit of time for our server to come over. When he did, we all felt he was rushing us and that we were kind of a bother to him. Not friendly at all. From there, it was just mistake after mistake. While the management and other staff that were helping to bring out food and such were very nice and apologetic, our server was not until the very end when it was time for the checks. Drinks were slow/wrong, salad wasn't brought before entree and then when it finally was, had the wrong dressing, one of the two med-rare filets was very rare, and it was frustrating that our server's attitude was crappy. One line of his was particularly annoying when while my friend was ordering her drink, he said \"Can you hand me that dirty fork?\" and then she had to repeat her drink order because he wasn't listening. French onion soup was still amazing, charcuterie board, oysters, bone-in ribeye and filet were great, but my husband's NY strip was a bit tough. Overall, the service left a bad taste in our mouths. Probably will try again, but likely not anytime soon.",

Started with the French onion soup, very good. server recommended the Chilean sea bass, now I'm a huge fan of this. There's was bland, it came over a bed of couscous which I wasn't a fan of but that again was bland. Portion size was about half that of say Ruth's Chris but within $4 of RC price. Scale of 1-10, 10 being great, 5-5.5. Chef really needs to experiment with pairings for this because it could have been much better. Wife had the filet. They butterflied it and the weird thing about this was one side was they way she wanted it (well), the other medium rare. We also had the broccolini which was underdone and once again, bland. We will try it again as we would any place because they could have just had a bad night but like this again and they won't be seeing us or the $400 dollars we spent, Stopped by the bar as well, bar scene wasn't bad but they need more than one cognac in the place. Oh, at bar we had the Charcuterie Board which was decent. Need a better selection of cheeses at least have goat cheese or some brie.",

The timing of food was terrible. They brought apps without plates,  brought out our entrees before salad and when we told them our waiter acted annoyed and said he'd bring them. We didn't want them after getting our entrees. After, the food was bland and uninteresting. Even the manager tried to argue with us about the service and food quality. WHAT? Well, when the check arrived they took of our entrees off the bill so the evening out didn't hurt as bad as it could have. We will pass on SG going forward.   We went last night for our anniversary and were so disappointed. We started with an appetizer and asked for the oysters rockefeller plain and they came warm. After, our salads were fine BUT the charred ceasar is a kale ceasar that is not charred. Our entrees were the worst...my husband ordered the filet and it was so tiny and bland served with basic fries. It was NOT comparable to any filets that you can get for almost the same price else where. My chicken was ok but served with greasy rice and overcooked broccolini. As for dessert we passed and didn't even get a Happy Anniversary from our waiter. Luckily the night was saved by stopping by DelFrisco's after where they treated us to dessert & an amazing port!",

My sister ordered the crab bisque and when it arrived I commented it looked good so he has the manager being one for me..... that I ended up paying for. I didn't ask for it. Food came out and he never checked on us. He went over specials and had no eye contact and looked disinterested in even working. He seemed disinterested in serving us overall I had to ask manager for a box to pack up food or basic water. The crab bisque was missing something and lacked flavor. The Rossi's were chicken was a big portion but the chicken was bland and the broccoli was over cooked. The mashed potatoes were okay. My sister didn't finish her fish sandwich and thought it lacked flavor. So we didn't order dessert or try the drinks. It wasn't a good experience at all.

We had the Lobster bites to start, excellent little morsels coated just right. My wife had the large beet salad for dinner, the beets were pickled just right and the salad had a great balance. I had the thick cut pork chop, chef cooked it perfect to my order, the chop was juicy and flavorful. The reduction had a hint of peppercorn and was great to swab each bite.  Apple Cobbler to finish a great night. Thanks to the staff for a great experience.",

The timing of the food being served was great. Allowed us to finish our salads before the entrees arrived. We ordered the halibut and osso bucco. The halibut was tough and over cooked. We mentioned this to the server. She said it was pan fried and walked away. Osso bucco was just ok. I would have given this establishment 4 stars, because maybe we just picked the wrong dishes that night, but the reason for the 3 stars was the service and the experience. The bartender/ server seemed like she would rather be anywhere then there. Her attitude almost made us feel uncomfortable like we were just bothering her. She barely looked you in the eye when asking if you wanted another drink. We barely could get out a yes or no before she walked off. I understand if she has something bigger going on in her life, so I hesitate to leave reviews, but we won't be going back. For the price point, there are so many other places we'd rather go that has better service and food.",

Classy, high end restaurant with a pleasantly tranquil environment.  I had the Chilean Sea Bass with truffle dusted fingering potatoes. It was a thick, perfectly cooked 6oz. piece with a nicely seared outside and moist on the inside. It came with a couscous side but I changed it out for the potatoes, which were beautifully seasoned. ($40) And my dirty martini was spot on, too! One friend had the NY strip and it was a big, thick cut cooked perfectly to her requested medium temp. It pared well w.their garlic mashed. She arrived early & had lobster bites and said they were out of this world....and she's a picky foodie. Another friend had some pasta and shrimp dish, which he loved. I could see the shrimp were a good size, too! We split their chocolate cake for dessert, which we found to be tasty (chambourd & chocolate) but it was dry. So, I didn't care for the texture. Even tho we had to ask for bread they were attentive about refilling the basket. I rate service as excellent. My rating is 5. In addition to the dining areas there is a very nice sized, beautiful wood carved bar. I will definately be going back! Can't wait to try their oyster rockerfellers!",

I thought twice about ordering a $22 Lobster Roll but figured at a high end restaurant like this it had to be wonderful...Surprise, it was fair.  The Lobster had no flavor, no seasoning and was cold, right out of the refrigerator.  The next time I came in for Sunday Brunch.  My son ordered shrimp and grits which was not tasty.  My son has a big appetite and he would not eat them.  We ordered the jalapeno cheddar biscuits which were nothing special.  I could not even taste the jalapenos or cheddar cheese and they were not  even warm.  The other dish we ordered was avocado toast with shrimp and I really loved it.  In fact the next time I went I ordered it at the bar and it was not nearly as good and I will not pay $20.00 for that dish again.  The bartenders are friendly and efficient.  The Manager is present and attentive but the food is marginal and I will just go for the expensive drinks at the bar from now on.  It's a beautiful place but they need to work on the food.",

They were priced at $30+ though. Especially at lunch just thought too expensive for crab cakes and fries. Awesome service from the waitstaff though.   Happy hour ordered an old fashioned and it was essentially a Shirley Temple with a dash of bourbon added for color.  Easily the worst drink I've ever had served to me at a bar that didn't smell like stale beer. Got a bourbon on the rocks after that and called it a night.   With Village Tavern right across the street serving a broader menu at lower prices with a better bar I'd just go there.  Not sure how this place will differentiate itself and stay in business with those prices.",

Our waiter was knowledgable and attentive, and not too attentive.  She ordered a French, made perfectly, not too sweet and froth on the top.  I ordered a classic and there were tiny ice chips on top.  Perfect.   Oysters as our appetizers were chilled and tasty.  She ordered the sea bass.  It was excellent.  I ordered the pork chop medium.  The outside was very good, the inside was cold and absolutely raw.  Not pink.  It was uncooked.  This upset my date and she asked that I take it back.  Sometimes you just want an evening to go without incident and so I didn't make a fuss.  I left half of the pork chop and it was clear that it was uncooked.  The waiter took no notice.  Unfortunate, but the rest of the meal was so good and I definitely was not hungry, we still gave it an 8.5/10.  We ordered carrot cake to go.  It was a sizable portion and still good when we ate it at home.    For the price, things could gave been better, but with so few fine dining choices close to our home we will give this place another chance to cook their food more thoroughly.",

My husband and I wanted to have a drink while we waited for friends to get into town for the fourth of July holiday. All other bars/restaurants in the area were busy the Wednesday before 4th of July in southpark. The Grille was not busy at all, maybe 10 people in the place. The valet person stated \"you have to go into the restaurant, you can't just park here for the fireworks\". We weren't there for the fireworks, and thought \"that's strange on how he greeted us\". we walked up to the bar and the older bartender (Mark)stated \"let me guess, you are here for the fireworks, and going to have one drink\", my husband and I looked at each other surprisingly and said no. he was rude and was rude to the other customers. He also said a off color race comment that offended me. when we paid our tab, he took my money and didn't give me change. when I asked for change, he rolled his eyes. I left him 1.50 tip because I was so put off with him.  If you do not want customers who you THINK are going to watch the fireworks, you should close for the night or do not be rude about it.Won't be back for a while.",

We had a reservation for 9:30 but arrived around 8:15-8:30pm and asked could we still be seated. And yes we were because the restaurant was empty besides a family of 4 or 5. The restaurant closes at 10 so we were happy we got there before time. Quentin instructed the hostess on where to seat us(behind the family of 5). He turned out to also be our Server. From the time we had any questions and ordered, Quentin was very short with us and not welcoming at all. He did give us some insight about the sides but we had to inquire about the Fish of the day amongst other things. He wasn't very forthcoming. We ordered. I ordered the Salmon which was ok, my girlfriend ordered the Pork Chop and as per usual when we dine out we sample each other's food(it was 5 of us). Immediately I tasted her Pork Chop and told her it was salty, she said yes I thought that too. She then gave another friend a piece and she had the same reaction. Eventually when Quentin came back she told him about the saltiness of the PC. He immediately asks her \"well what do you want me to do about it?\" If you would've said something before you finished I could have done something about it! What!!!!!! There clearly was meat on the PC. We each had a sliver. You couldn't finish it because your pressure would've been sky high. So she asks for the manager, and clearly stated that she is going to pay for her meal, that she just wants to let them know that the food is salty. Quentin states he is the manager. And still was rude. Ok so fast forward to him coming back to bring another drink that I ordered for a friend because she didn't want to deal with his rudeness, another friend ordered the Crab-cakes which tasted like fish cakes. There were two of them, she ate half of one. He asked her was she done, she states yes and tells him she didn't like them. Bill time!!! He removes the crab cakes from her bill and the PC from the other meal. He brings out my cake, they sing to me. Gathers their cash and cards to pay for the meal and my Pork Chop friend asks Quentin was it too late and possible to order a soda to go?  Old Mr. Quentin says No, but then rolls his eyes as he's walking away from the table. We are through at this point and it's closing time. Quentin never said thank you to us as he did the table of Five seated in front of us. He addressed that man by his name. He said \"have a good evening Mr. so and so\". But our group of 5 Women he just turned on the lights!!!!! How freaking rude.",

It's a well run place and they're always quick to make things right (that goes a long way). I do like that you can occasionally spot some popular panthers players dining with their families and the place becomes abuzz with fans pointing... LOL. The French onion soup is by far the best I've had in Charlotte - it's a meal in itself, so beware if you order it, you won't be hungry for much else after you devour it. :) Avocado ranch dressing is what salad dreams are made of. YUM!",

Our server responded with \"Im sorry everyone in the kitchen has left, we could MAYBE cut you a piece of cake.\" WHAT???!!! So we came in with the intention of having a full meal on the rare occasion we get a date night AWAY without our kiddos and want to end our meal with dessert and after spending $150+ for 2 there is no one left in the kitchen to make a dessert??!! There were still several tables left in the establishment I might add.  And coming from working in the industry (fine dinning at that) we would NEVER  tell a guest that information firstly, and secondly a manager would always be more then willing to accommodate a guest especially at this caliber of a restaurant. Dumb founded.",

They were way too salty and that truffle flavor was horrendous.  I have never met a French fry that I didn't like, until this meal.  French fries are spectacular without much extra attention!  We love everything else here, that's why the fries were an even bigger disappointment.   Avoid at all cost.  Hopefully I have made my point!  On a positive note, get the pumpkin cheesecake.  It is spectacular. It probably won't be available forever here. I am sure it is a seasonal dessert.",

The lunch menu features a nice variety without overwhelming you with options. On the day my visit I opted for the French onion soup with the small beet salad and I added fried oysters.   That salad and fried oyster combo was amazing! My teenage son had the turkey burger with fries which he enjoyed as well.",

We started with lobster bites, flatbread and onion rings - the lobster bites were a must order item for an appetizer. Next we had a sampling of their park salad - the homemade peanut brittle sets this salad apart.  Scallops, chicken and waffles and brussel sprouts rounded out our tasting menu. Will definitely be back for a date night or happy hour to hit up their 1/2 price wine night, atmosphere is dressy casual to business attire. The location is great and they offer valet parking.",

A couple of ppl in our party did not make it because w/the rain they could not see the signage so drove into the parking garage & thought that their GPS had directed them to the wrong place.  If they have a door from the parking garage to the establishment besides the service entrance direction to it would be greatly appreciated.     All the dishes were good but for the price point nothing stood out as outstanding.  Mushroom ravioli & the calamari & crab appetizers were solid performances.   Def say that increased signage maybe for the valet to indicate there is one when the weather is vision limiting would be a bonus.",

To start our cocktails were fantastic, especially the Sorghum Sour, a solid take on the classic whiskey sour. The Lobster Bites, however, took things to a whole new level! Incredible appetizer! Things continued in that same fashion with both Chelsea's Porcini Pappardelle, and my Filet. Finally the Pumpkin Cheesecake hit the mark, as I am a huge dessert connoisseur! Service was also very good! Excellent experience all the way around!",

I ordered the Prime Rib Hash with a fried egg on top which was recommended by our waiter and it was so delicious! I also had a Bellini that was very good, I wanted another but for $11 one would do. The staff was great and checked on us often enough not to interrupt what we were doing but enough to make sure we were always good and didn't need anything. Everyone liked their food for the most part, just the chicken and waffles has a maple chili glaze on it (which it states on the menu) and a couple of the ladies weren't to fond of it so my suggest is just get it in the side if you want to try it. As far as parking, there's a parking garage that is connected that's free.",

When we got there she began to sit us in front of the wait station and again I said I want closer to the windows (it was still light out and we wanted to enjoy the dusk)...she again slapped her hand on the table to grab the menus, sat us where I suggested and walked away in a huff (a note for the management - she is the blonde in need of an attitude adjustment that was working this evening).  The service... Our server, Marybeth was excellent...knowledge of the wine list and menu, attentive, perfect timing...  The wine list... Adequate.  The food... Prime rib...very tough! NY Strip...tough! But the potatoes, broccoli and asparagus...perfect.  Our exit... Again...it is all about the service...the valet was polite, he asked the right questions, he was all about \"the service\"!!!  Our desert to go... Chocolate cake...best part of the meal!!!
