Wrong order, wrong drink refills, and it took 1:49 from the time we placed our order until the food reached the table. A member of our party stated a food allergy, he had to order twice and still received food that contained his stated allergy. Upon notifying the manager we were told not to worry the check was taken care of and he apologized. He suggested we dessert as well, which took another 34 minutes, and arrived with the check. Upon leaving we had to walk by the rear of the building were the waitress and manager were talking and over heard her complaining about us, when confronted the manager apologized again and returned inside. Needless to say we will not return to this location again, and I would suggest that you do the same. We were not the only ones with a grievance as several other  patrons were given gift cards and comped bills.",

    "text": "i know, I know--Olive Garden, how pedestrian of me! I don't have too many chain restaurant reviews, so I figured I'd write one. We went for a surprise birthday party. My friend had made a reservation which they somehow didn't have (maybe she called the wrong one? Anyway, I'm not going to dock for this). The staff was very accommodating, they were able to put a table together for us on short notice.   When we sat down, I was immediately hit by a gross smell. I asked my friend \"Do you smell that? It smells like...\" to which he replied \"wet dog!\" which is exactly what I was thinking. It smelled badly like wet dog. How disgusting. Maybe it was the table--can you say dirty rags? While we waited for the rest to arrive, we got breadsticks and were also told that dessert for the birthday would be a charge. Really? Come on now. The bread sticks were pretty underwhelming--there was no garlic or flavor really. Booo.   Once everyone arrived, we placed orders. I got the Bruschetta Salmon. When I asked the waiter how it was, he said he hadn't tried it in forever but that people say it's decent--I appreciated that honesty! They served salad shortly     My goodness this place was slow though. The food took forever. When it came out, it was pretty lousy. I found two bones in the salmon before I quit eating it. The risotto pasta thing under it was so heavy and the salmon was sort of hard and the toppings made no sense. It felt like two or three dishes in one. Others' food didn't come out, so the manager came out and apologized and comped several meals. He even went up to the birthday boy and told him he'd comp his dessert as well. Thumbs up.   Dessert was actually pretty good--I got the chocolate tuxedo mousse cake which was quite good and it seems everyone else enjoyed theirs as well. The only reason this place is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is for service. Our waiter was personable and friendly, and the manager was excellent. I'd stay away from this garden like the plague, though.",

We called at 5:50pm and told them we wanted to come in around 6:30pm and wanted to make a reservation for 6. The hostess on the phone informed me that there was no need to call ahead. We again mentioned that it is a party of 6. She said they are so slow that we don't need it. OKAY!  We get to the parking lot at 6:30pm and it is packed!!!!! We were a little confused because what we were told earlier. Once we got inside we were told we would have a 40 minute wait. I was pissed because the lady on the phone insisted that we do not need a reservation and here we are stuck waiting. We wanted to talk to the manager, who never came. However after 5 minutes a party of 7 failed to show up and we were given their table. This made sense, we appreciated it.  Thereafter, we did the endless pasta for 9 bucks and the soup/salads. Its an olive garden. The food was really good it was nice and warm so thats always a plus. The breadsticks were extremely fresh and flavorful among the best I had. The waitress was attentive but not to much! Our drinks and food were prompt, she came around enough, extremely nice. She made the experience that began negatively a whole lot better. Had we had a horrible waitress the place would have gotten maybe 2 stars.  ALLYSON IS AMAZING =] truly a pleasure!",

It smells like moldy cheese or dirty feet or something similar. The server said a child cried and cried the day before because it smelled so bad. The server speculated it was the carpet. When I spoke to the manager he said that carpet is regularly cleaned. So I'm not really sure what the smell was coming from but it ruined our dinner. It's hard to enjoy a meal when it smells like you're eating in the sewer.",

I had the mushroom ravioli, but got the lemon creme sauce on it.  I liked it but the sauce was a bit salty for me.  We sat at the bar (no tv), just because it's always a wait for a table. (I don't know how Olive Gardens are not doing well, they are always packed)  Sitting at the bar was a great choice because we got to meet Vildan (I hope I'm remembering that correctly)!  She was so wonderful!  She was aware of what we needed and when and would chat a bit with us then leave us to have our own conversation.  She is really charming and friendly and I would go back here just for her personality and service.    I think they could use a really good cleaning at the restaurant.  I've said this in another review, but things just seem a bit grimy.  Also at the drink stations on either side of the bar the iced-tea and lemonade dispensers were uncovered (i know they are supposed have a lid on them), so that was a little gross, to me.  I was glad I hadn't ordered tea or lemonade.",

The salad was good as always they really do have tasty dressing.   The service was great we sat at the bar as we mostly do wherever we go.

However, we had a gift card and decided to go have dinner.   We got there around 6 and had no wait for a table. However, when we left, there was alot of people in the lobby waiting for a seat.  We both ordered a glass of the house red. Well priced and very good for a house wine.  I ordered the soup and salad with the pasta fagoli soup. My husband ordered the lasagna primavera from the lighter side part of the menu (it had spinach and veggies in it).  Breadsticks and salad came out like expected. The breadsticks are alway delish and hard to turn away eating more. The soup was very good and my husbands lasagna was even better. However, we were joking that there is no wonder that the lasagna was on the lighter side. It was so small!! I guess we should have expected that, given that making lasagna \"light\" isn't an easy task. I can't even begin to explain to you how small it was......AND normally we normally split meals at restaurants, so we are typically used to smaller portions to begin with! Probably the size of half a deck of cards (width, length, and height) with like 3 small pieces of grilled chicken on it. He ate it and didn't complain....it was tasty, though!  Normally we skip dessert but when the waitress came by, my husband ordered the pumpkin cheesecake (not sure if it was because he was still hungry or just craving something sweet!). This was SO good. HUGE slice of cheesecake. Very tasty and that slice was gone in like 5 minutes haha.   Overall, ok experience, just wouldnt go back unless we had another gift card.",

I forgot that the two are no longer affiliated  (Darden sold Red Lobster last year), but I received the card this past Christmas and it still said it could be used at OG, so I planned to use it.  I ordered online and the site said my order would be ready at 7 and to pick it up at the hostess stand; neither were True.  I arrived at the restaurant at 7:00, waited 5 minutes at the hostess stand and then was directed to the bar area that a small \"To Go\" sign that was not at all separated from the bar patrons.  There were several couples in there who said they were doing a bar crawl from Red Lobster to OG to Applebee's to Hooter's.  Wow, only in Charlotte would you find a chain restaurant bar crawl.  One of the patrons tried paying with a Red Lobster gift card and it did not work.  That's when I realized mine would not work either, but I feel it should still be honored since it says it on the card.    Anyway, after waiting another 20 minutes for my order (almost a total of an hour and half since I ordered it) and listening to screaming children and crying babies, I realized  why I haven't dined at an OG in years (besides the ridiculously long wait times).    The food was actually accurate.   The iceberg salads were huge.  It's OG though, so neither were anything spectacular.  It saved me from cooking and doing dishes though.  Again, there are just too many real Italian restaurants in the area without screaming babies and hour long waits that serve flavorful food at reasonable prices (Portofino's and Docle come to mind) to deal with Olive Garden.  I would go for a to go order IF I had a gift card, but that's about it.  I will never go to OG on my own accord.  If I were going to a corporate chain Italian restaurant, it would be Carabba's.  Food is fresher and  they don;t have as many loud kids.",

    "text": "Popped in for a take out order on a very busy Sunday afternoon. I don't know why the OG gets so busy on family holidays like Mother's Day, but on this one it was packed solid with people waiting outside, inside and in the bar area.  We were able to place our to go order with the very busy takeout manager. That guy should get five stars. But the rest of the place, not so much. We sat at the bar for 30 minutes waiting to place the order and then waiting for it. Could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink? Maybe offered a glass of water? Nope.  The food was OG standard but again it was packed perfectly with the salad in an interesting container that kept the lettuce and such fresh with the dressing and croutons separate. They also put a separator to keep the cold stuff from affecting the hot stuff.  Two stars because the place was less than tidy and the bar staff didn't seem interested in customers. Otherwise, it would have been pretty good.",

There were maybe 40 people in the whole restaurant and she gave us a beeper and said it would be about 5 minutes. Then she said could we sit in the bar if a table wasn't available. None were so we sat at a booth in the bar area. Service was slow, as is normally the case eating in the bar area. The 1 bartender doesn't have time to truly take care of you. Another in our party ordered ice tea twice and was brought fruity tea both times. The third time order diet Coke. I think Olive Garden just likes to make people wait so they think they are in a good place to eat. Think Again! Eat at a LOCALLY OWNED business and get better service.",

Our server was prompt and informative and our first course arrived on our table less than 8 minutes from the time we ordered it!  The salad had only one complaint and it seems to be a consistent issue with this restaurant - one that really doesn't make sense to me - olives ! There are two olives in the large bowl of salad ... If you want more than two olives, you have to ask for them - which is strange since their very name boasts of them ! Have found this to be the case each to time I've eaten here.  Spaghetti & meat sauce was my meal and it  was yummy.  Hubs had seafood Alfredo . He said he wouldn't recommend it again but it was just okay.   Tiramsu was delicious and the coffee was fresh and piping hot ! No complaints other than the olive shortage ...",

But it kept me from eating too much so not necessarily a bad thing.   Anna brought salad and breadsticks before we ordered.  We only ordered appetizers for our entrees.  At the end of the meal we paid on the table apparatus    Her appearance at our table had been spotty at best but luckily another server was around.  She asked if we had paid. We said yes.  She said in a huff...\"In the future know there will be an extra charge for the salad since we didn't order what they label as entrees\". And walked off never to be seen.  We didn't order a salad OR Breadsticks  for that matter. She brought them.  To get that upset over lettuce and to assume we were deceitful was ridiculous. Wish I could get back my generous tip.  Not sure if we will be back to OG and def not to this location.",

Appetizer and meal came out at almost the same time and since we were at a VERY small table it was overcrowded.  My husband's pasta had very little sauce and my Salmon was overcooked.  We never got a drink refill even after my husband asked for one.  I am assuming the waitress was new (I hope so) as everyone around us either had their order messed up or it took forever to get service.  If she was new I would think the Manager would have offered some assistance to her but that was not the case.  Very disappointed with our visit.",

As this location is directly in front of Carolina Place mall (right next to a Red Lobster), there is ALWAYS a wait at peak times, and on the weekends, fuggedaboudit.  I was making a trip to the mall and thought some salad and bread sticks would properly fuel me for a shopping battle.  I arrived right around 5:30 on a Monday, so there was no wait then, but as I was dining, the place began to fill.  I was promptly greeted by my friendly waiter, who kept the drink refills coming throughout my meal without being asked.  They have a current special with soup or salad, plus a selection of entrees, plus a small dessert, for $12.95, so I got that.  The salad was an OG salad, iceberg with various onions and such thrown in, but I do like their salad dressing and the salad was ice cold, which is how I prefer it.  I got a basket of 5 bread sticks for just me, and it was all I could do to not eat all 5.  They were soft and warm and quite tasty.  I got the bucatini with meat sauce for my entree, and it was fine - as expected.  I knew it wasn't going to be the best Italian(ish) dish I had ever had, but it got the job done.  The dessert was a small cake with a strawberry sauce layered in it it (I can't remember the name) and it was fine as well.  It tasted like something from the prepared food section at HT, and it was a sweet finish to my meal.    The waitstaff was friendly and attentive without hovering, the food was fine and as expected.  It was A-OK.",

    "text": "I've been to a number of Olive Gardens across the country and this one by far has me most unimpressed of all.   Our server, Derek A. (tall, bald guy), was hopeless to say the least. He didn't mention any specials, didn't get us our drink refills in time and never offered any additional bread sticks or salad. Finally waited forever to ask for a to-go box and our check, only to hear him whine to another person right behind us about how he can't seem to catch a break and how he can't even pronounce my name. Ahem, ok, but don't say it right in front of the customer?? :)  Food portions were great and entrees were yummy, but breaksticks were not warm as we've come to expect from Olive Gardens. And did I mention that we didn't get any extra? :D  Anyways, horrible experience. Maybe he was having an off day, but I'd suggest asking to be waited by someone else (everyone else seemed wonderful!) and I believe your server's attitude is directly proportional to your dining experience.",

    "text": "Tonight was my first time at this Olive Garden. My boyfriend and I just moved here from out of state. I've been craving Olive Garden for some time so we thought we'd go out tonight for a date night since I'm leaving for a week early tomorrow morning. We moved from a small town and I didn't think about how busy it would be since it was Saturday night. We got there and the wait was about 45 mins. It was almost an hour before we got seated. We were seated in the same section with a large party. Our waiter was Tim. He came over and got our order. He was less than friendly. My boyfriend had a big lunch so he just ordered soup and I made my own pasta. I asked if I could get half Alfredo and half marinara. He said \"oooh I don't know. I'll have to check.\" I knew they were busy so I said if not I'll just take all marinara.   We pulled up the bill on the screen at the table and he added a $1.79 charge to split the sauce. I don't understand why because I wasn't asking for extra, I just wanted half and half. He didn't tell me that it would be extra. Later on, I heard the large group next to us ask if they could switch something out and he said that it would be an upcharge. Not sure why he didn't want to tell me that. The next time he came back, he dropped off our drinks, my salad and my bf's soup. He never asked if my bed wanted his soup at a specific time, just brought it with my salad. I asked if he could change my pasta to just marinara and he said he didn't think so.   He left and came back about 2 mins later with my pasta and said they had already made it. I hadn't even been able to take a bite of my salad yet. I had just enough time to put it on my plate. It felt like he was trying to rush us out of the restaurant. The salad was also DRENCHED in dressing. It was more like a little lettuce with my dressing or soup. From the time we sat down to the time we got ALL of our food it was 13 mins. I've never felt so rushed. I was so irritated. He brought out some more bread sticks and another bowl of soup for my bf.  Then he came over and put the receipt on the table and didn't say anything. I put money on it and he asked if we needed change. We said yes. When he brought the change back he threw it down on the table without chocolates. He probably realized that he wasn't getting a tip and for the first time might have realized that we weren't happy, yet he didn't say anything.   As we were walking out, I asked at the hostess stand if they don't give out chocolates anymore. They said no we do, why? I said our waiter didn't give us any but it could have been because he was terrible. The manager over heard me and inquired about what happened. I explained all of the stuff above and she apologized profusely. She gave us a gift card for more than our dinner was and asked that we please come back and give them another chance. She is the only reason this is not a 1 star review. She definitely felt bad and was not happy with the way we were treated. I just wish that Tim had realized that his service was terrible.",

    "text": "Until recently, I worked near the mall and a couple of weeks ago my wife and daughter decided to surprise me at work for a family lunch date and this OG was selected.  Biggest mistake ... ever.  The only positive part of the visit was the host/hostess station, who had their act together enough to seat us with minimal wait.  We then sat at the table for15 minutes before anyone resembling a waiter appeared.  When our waiter approached our table, he set down two menus and walked away without saying a single word or acknowledging us in any way.  We then waited another 10 minutes before he returned to take our drink AND meal order.  At this point, we were both upset but decided to give them a pass since it was a busy lunch rush on a Friday.  My wife and I both ordered coke and decided to get the all you can eat three pasta promotion and asked for our garlic bread and salad to be brought out before the meal.    We then did not see our waiter again for 30 minutes when he appeared carrying our entire meal out on one tray - drinks and pasta - without salad or bread sticks.  We were visibly upset at this point, my lunch hour was now over, and we were just now getting our incomplete first round of our \"all you can eat\" order.  He literally put the food down on the edge of the table without asking us who had which dish and disappeared again.  My wife had ordered the fettuccine Alfredo for her first dish. I am not exaggerating when I say that what she was brought was a bowl of cold linguini noodles with a glubbed-on ball of cold Alfredo sauce sitting in the center on top of the noodles.  I never request to see the manager when the service is this poor because management is always the problem.  Incompetent management breeds the hiring of incompetent wait staff, so rather than make a scene I simply leave the restaurant.  If they care to stop me to try to insist I pay, well then game on.  No one stopped me.  I returned to work with an empty stomach and placed yet another restaurant on my black list.  And we never did receive our salad and bread.  Olive Garden - your food is not that good to begin with.  If you wish to stay in business, I suggest you visit stores for quality checks on a much more frequent basis - especially this location.  Just dreadfully awful.  Cheers!",

It was what you expect at all of the chains. I got chicken and shrimp carbonarra (spell check). It was fair. What does one expect for something quick and convenient to what I was doing at the time.  I do wish however that I spent the gift card next door just shoveling cheddar bays down my throat. Good talk.",

The service was subpar- I sat at the bar and the bartender was far more interested in talking to coworkers than the few patrons at the bar.  Secondly, the kitchen is one of the worst in the entire company. The Zuppa Toscana was devoid of the spiciness that makes the soup as well as full of fatty sausage.  I also ordered the Ravioli di Portobello, it came out stone cold, unacceptable for a baked entree. I sent it back and the second time it came out it was just as cold. I finally spoke to a manager who comp'd my meal. I will never be back to this location.",

Then Food ordered was new promos that had no details and had to rely on waitress which was clueless! She lied about the meal all together. Ended up with 2 meals un eaten. The bread finally arrived at end and lemon never came...she kept saying it was being cut! Ended with her dropping our plate on floor causing flying glass and never got a mint! Well at least she was smart enough to ask mgr to talk to us b4 us asking!",

No matter how crowded a restaurant is or how backed up in the kitchen, it should never take 10 minutes to get drinks.  2. I know Olive Garden isn't known for its high food quality, but I do expect some consistency with national chain menus. Tonight I tried the new creamy mushroom sauce. Pictured below is what I found at the bottom of the bowl. Yuck. Also, I found a solitary potato chunk in the noodles? 3. Nasty bathrooms 4. You may not believe it, but the inside of my water glass smelled musty. I thought it may have been a fluke, but then read other reviews on here complaining about various odors at this particular establishment",

From the minute i walked in, there was nothing be smiles and polite greetings. After confirming my name, she notified me that the meal was in the hot oven still to make sure it stayed fresh, salad was in a refrigerated area so it could remain cool, and confirmed my order details to make sure everything was made correctly. She even made sure she opened the box for me to have a visual to make sure everything was correct. She offered extra dressings and suggested that I tried their ranch dressing instead of the typical vinaigrette. It seems all so simple but I really appreciated them going over the top just to ensure I was satisfied and tbh it didn't even seem forced like some places do.

If not, I'd skip the headache and find somewhere else!   Fun fact, they will close your bottle of wine up for you if you don't finish it so you can take it home",

We had to ask the waiter 5 times to bring some garlic bread, he finally did when we were almost done eating. My sons lasagna was cold and my ravioli was a cold congealed mess. I have had to many bad experiences at this location in Pineville and will never return again. We're not even sure we will go to any Olive Garden again.",

I think that is to be expected with a chain.  Sometimes I have a good experience and sometimes not so much.  I think that it is a little overpriced, and seems that the pricing is always going up while the quality of food is always going down.  Sometimes I think that it was better several years ago.  The breadsticks seem to never change, always good-and I always eat too much of them!!",

We orderes the mozzarella appetizer which was good, i.ordered the soup and salad my wife ordered build your own pasta rigatoni with LIGHT oil white wine sauce with shrimp. My wifes dish came out and as the waitress was putting it down on the table she stated i know its not light sauce but the kitchen told me to try it anyways. It was like soup so we sent it back. The 2nd time it came out but not with rigatonis but with angel hair that was so overcooked it was mush so it was sent back again and then the 3rd time as the waitress is standing there my wife pulls out a very long black hair so we gave up on her dinner.   Not once did the manager come over to apologize and left the waitress to take the heat and didn't empower her to discount anything. Mr or Mrs Manager quit hiding and get out to the dining room to see your guests. We had an older white lady which was great.",

However the take home choices are only the 4 basic options. Service was amazing!!! We had the most accommodating easiest server ever. The kitchen on the other hand was very slow.  The complimentary soup and salad was fine as normal but we had to wait for our main dishes to come out. Then we have a few complainant about the meals. The server was willing to fix the issues but we were tired and ready to go so we just kept the original meals. This is not my fav place for Italian but we will probably be back in the future for one of their many promotions.",

    "text": "I am a single woman and take myself out to dinner a lot.  Last week I went into an Olive Garden by myself looking forward to a wonderful dinner.  I was seated at a single booth with a lot of tables across from me.  I sat there for awhile before the waiter came over and I gave him my order.  He delivered my salad and entree without a word.  Meanwhile, he is across the way chatting up and laughing with the customers at his other tables.  He never came back to say \"How's everything\" or anything to me, but totally ignored me.  He never brought me a check or asked me if I would like dessert or would like boxes to take my feed out.  In other words, he totally snubbed me.  He and I had had no words or anything for him to be mad at me.  I kept trying to catch his eye for my check but he would walk right by and never look my way.  Finally a waitress must have sensed my distress and stopped to see what she could do for me.  She plated my food into a box for me and continued to apologize for his rudeness.  She also went to get the manager.  I was in customer service and serving for 35 yrs. and had never been treated this way by anyone.  The manager of course apologized and said this man had also been in the business for 30 yrs.  The manager did his best to make up for this rudeness and gave me a free dessert for my bad service.  I was furious and am still seething.  Obviously he got not one red cent from me, but I'm sure he was looking for good tips from all his other customers.  What he didn't know was that I am an excellent tipper, even though I am just a little single woman.",

We chose call ahead seating and that helped with our wait on a Saturday night.  The wait was nearly an hour for walk-ins, but we waited approximately 30 mins.   Service was friendly, but our server appeared to be overloaded. She was frazzled and was a bit \"snappy\" in her interactions with us. Clearly she was stressed because otherwise, she was very nice and friendly. Service was very slow for and some items that were requested either arrived too late to be used (sauce for an appetizer, for example) or not at all (drinks).     The food was decent. Served hot and pretty tasty. However, the prices have increased, but the portions are much smaller than they have been historically. I can completely understand the increase in prices (costs have gone up on everything, right?!?), but it's disheartening that portions have reduced so significantly.  Soup, Salad, and Breadsticks still completely on-point!",

In that time, we only ordered soup, salad and an appetizer. Originally, We were told a 30 minute so we opted to sit in the bar area. HUGE MISTAKE. I asked for a second salad, which never came. My minestrone soup had an entire can of beans in my one bowl. I found 3 pieces of lettuce with mold on it. It was so hard to get ahold of our waitress that I never got a chance to complain. Even if I did, nothing would have happened anyways. Terrible experience... We only came here because I was having pregnancy cravings for their salad. I pray to god I do not have another craving like this again because my baby can starve before I step foot in here again. Absolutely unacceptable all the way around. If you're going to eat here, wait the extra time for a table because the wait staff in the bar have no idea what's going on. Oh and the table smelled weird so my constructive criticism would be to use a clean rag to clean it off next time.",

All were hard on the outside and VERY aldente in the middle - should just serve it with bread sticks. I had the steak gorgonzola, it was fun but the portion wasn't with the $17.  Oh our server was very polite and did a fine job but she would serve us from the opposite side of the table - she was like 5'2\" and had to practically lay on the table to reach is and even then the plates banged on the table.",

Olive Garden does not do reservations on the weekend, but we only had about a 10-15 minute wait to be seated.  We arrived around 7:30 pm on a Saturday.  Once the food was ordered, it took around 45 min before the food arrived to the table.  The restaurant didn't seem to be crowded.  There were a few times where we were without drinks waiting for the waitress to return.  The food came out and tasted decent.  I ordered the chicken and shrimp carbonara.  Olive Garden is one of my wife's favorite restaurant, but she was unhappy with the seasoning of her food and the service on this day.  When we were finished eating, it took an another 15-20 minutes just waiting on the bill and an additional 10 minutes waiting on the food to take home via the special once paid.  My daughter was happy at the end of the night however which was a plus!",

    "text": "Had terrible service when my group and I went to eat there last night. It started off fine, but progressively got worse. We over heard our waitress complain about a $5 tip on a $95 tab, which was unfortunate. But my guess is, after that incident, she correlated that with us and assumed we'd give her a bad tip as well causing her service to be absolutely terrible. We tried being patient with her and were exceptionally polite as to not \"bother\" her with requests that we needed: refills, salad, or bread. We, as guests, shouldn't feel as though we're bothering your employee with requests that should be second nature for the job task as a waitress. We saw her multiple times having conversations with the other employees, so apparently she had plenty of time to tend to us. She had no problem attending to the other table around either. So by the end of the night my group and I were fed up, we only had one refill and was never checked on to see if we needed anything. We paid for our meals and wanted to leave, but before that we asked our waitress to bring us some salads to go along with some togo boxes. We waited 20 minutes, as you guys were closing, only to see her walk by and try ignore us like we didn't ask for anything. The fact that she ignored us is what really made me upset. My friend politely asked her again along with a bag to carry all the food in and she got even more of an attitude and went to go get the salads. She came back with the salads with no dressing and no bag, but hurried off before we could tell her about it. So we waited again till we saw her and asked for the dressing and bag, of course she still had the attitude and went to go get them. Will never eat here again, and it's thanks to the terrible service received by that one individual waitress. If you don't liked to be asked to get things, why become a server?",

I couldn't believe that she has never been here before so I HAD to take her. We ordered salad and breadsticks. We also both ordered the chicken Alfredo. Food was excellent.   I couldn't give 5 stars because our server never refilled our drinks. We were finished with our drinks halfway through.

Just be nice and have a customer centric attitude and watch how any situation services itself. It's a lost art; customer service that is.  Nonetheless, Jeff the GM tried to get me my meal and more but I just couldn't eat. I'm truly grateful for his efforts. I only wish the bartender had the same bedside manners. I recommend waiting for a fine meal rather than try to squeeze it out of the bar. I will return to this place but just not the bar (not during peak hours). Thanks Jeff  However, we returned, for a good faith second trip to the same location. We found the same bartender with same bedside rudely manner, an overwhelmed overworked staff and under or over cooked food.  I had to change the review from 4 to 2 stars respectively. In addition, we had been drinking from cracked glassware unfortunately and could have swallowed broken glass. Once again, our meal was refunded (I sent my meal back because it was cold and over cooked). All In all, thanks for inviting us back with a gift card to boast. Nevertheless, we gave the card away to a couple waiting to be seated in the lounge. Hopefully, they have a better experience.",

But today this wasn't the case, my cousin was RAVING about the new duo deal that they offer during lunch time. All you can eat soup and salad. I simply told her if it wasn't all that you're making it out to be I'm going to be MAD {that's what really hungry people say} LOL!  When I walked in I was IMMEDIATELY blown away by the beautiful upgrades, yes its been that long I didn't know that had updated the location. The bar was beautiful, the Italian wording on the walls, and they even had bottles of wine in glass cases on the wall. It had to be about, not sure who or how those are kept clean but kudos to that person lol.  We were seated by our hostess and provided menus, shortly after our server came out. I liked how prompt she was and she greeted us with a smile and her name... VERY important. Alex offered the wine sampling for us and offered to start us with waters. We knew what we wanted to order so we all went with the soup and salad. My cousin and I had the Chicken and Gnocchi - A creamy soup made with roasted chicken, traditional Italian dumplings and spinach, and our other cousin had the Zuppa Toscana - Spicy Italian sausage, fresh kale and russet potatoes in a creamy broth. Made with gluten-free ingredients.  After finishing up our third round of the unlimited soup and salad we were able to able to take what we could not finish home. I was happy about that, usually, when restaurants offer unlimited you're not able to take what's left on your plate and the restaurants throw it away. This made me very happy, and as i'm typing up this review i'm enjoying my leftovers.   Happy Cusotmer!",

Now, whether the quality of its quasi fast food warrants such a wait is debatable, but I must admit, I usually leave pretty satisfied and happy (and stuffed).  Now, I know I am regularly critical of large chains but I'm a sucker for those doggone piping hot, salty topped, buttery breadsticks and that big bowl of Italian salad with the black olives, pepperoncinis, sliced Romas and red onions. Add in the savory Tuscan Zuppa with potatoes and sausage and I've got a meal for $7.49, or at least a lunch. This visit our group also ordered the Margarita Chicken and the Angel Hair with Chicken, both were good but not great. This seems to be the case with rest ot he menu too.  Service was very attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is always lively and the sanitation rating was 97. This location is also consistently well-managed. In general, the typical Olive Garden is no more than a 3 star restaurant, however I have no reason not to give this location 4 stars. Hey, I've never been disappointed here, what can I say?",

The server didn't take the food away (again, not experienced), and left the nasty hair in front of me for everyone to stare out for the duration of the meal.  She did offer to replace it, but I declined, since, sadly, I had already consumed most of it.  Bleh.    I am also not a fan of these new devices that sit table side where you can order and pay on your own.  Where is the personal customer service?  Isn't that what I am tipping a server for?  Why am I ordering my own dessert, etc.?  Not to mention when I ordered said dessert, it didn't come to the table until the server eventually stopped back by and I had to tell them that I had ordered it.  So what was the point in me ordering it???  On top of that, I couldn't pay the check since the manager had to remove the hairy item.    Very rarely do I venture into a chain.  I have a select few favs and the occasional one off, but this likely isn't one I'll return to.",

So we definitely made the right decision there. As far as Olive Gardens go, I think this one has a really nice bar area. For seating, they have a lot more table seating than booth seating, which is great to accommodate large parties. Their salad and breadsticks never disappoint and you can always count on the consistency of Olive Garden. I ordered the Shrimp Alfredo and it was delightful and comforting. My boyfriend had their special of the chicken and shrimp carbonara and he really enjoyed it! He had never had carbonara before. Our server was very attentive and nice. She offered us wine before our meal as a sampling. She checked up on us often and brought refills of breadsticks.   I don't really like how OG started using those little computers on the table for payment, because we had issues with it. Honestly would just like for the server to bring it out as normal",

When I requested a little more sauce for my pasta Valentina did not hesitate to fix it. She moved with tenacity and with a purpose. She made me feel important and as if she cared about my meal even with having other customers. Towards the end of the visit, Brian (her boss), came over and made causal conversation about our birthday. He even bought us dessert which was very sweet and thoughtful!! *Everyone MUST try the cheesecake! It was amazing.*  I will definitely be back again with family and friends... hopefully with Valentina as OUR server",

    "text": "Terrible service. The restaurant was packed and there was a 30 minute wait for a table but we found a spot on the bar. We quickly grabbed a high top table after ordering drinks from the bartender. Our server had about 7 tables so he was busy. When he greeted us we asked for menus as we had none. Our food was slow to come out but it was busy so that is understandable. The food was good our only issue was the long time between getting more breadsticks and my boyfriend wanted a soup refill that never came. He also ordered another beer that sat in the window for about 7 minutes before a server finally brought it to us. During this time the bartender only had 1 person at the bar but she didn't think she needed to run any drinks. Also an expo employee was hanging out at the bar but not helping our server who was clearly in the weeds. Also as people left the tables were not bussed until eventually a host came and cleaned them. A manager walked by and saw the mess and did nothing!   Towards the end of our meal we got our check after trying to pay on the kiosk at the table which had the wrong check on it. If a restaurant wants to have this technology they need to make sure guests can use it.   The tables around us were also upset at the bad service and were complaining to the manager. His exact words were \"sorry for the bad service the server was busy\". That is absolutely unacceptable when the manager saw the server was busy earlier and did not help him!  We left without complaining since clearly the manager didn't care.   Our poor server did the best he could but he was clearly oversat and had no help from his management or other employees.",

These people really need to get out more because even compared with the other Italian chains, they are last on my list.    I don't know how I ended up here today.  I guess my car made me come here due to the fact I couldn't make up my mind where to go for lunch.  I will give OG one thing....The Zuppa Tuscana is pretty darn good..good enough for 2-3 bowls.  The salad was awful..,,no wonder it was all you can eat.  Who wants to eat gobs and gobs of iceberg lettuce?  The server was really good but he wasn't busy either.  He only had another table besides mine so it was like he was hawking over me which is just as bad as not being around at all.  And then he gave me a water to go without asking.  I will say this...It's the first place I've ever had a togo cup filled with water.",

My lunch companion and I both got soup, salad, and breadsticks with Zuppa Toscana.  The bread sticks were brought out before we even ordered which made them cold by the time the remainder of our food was brought.  A refill was never offered.  The salad was swimming in dressing where normally the dressing is light.  And the Zuppa Toscana was unrecognizable.  It was totally different from all other OG restaurants I've visited.  We had several different servers during our short stay.  I doubt that I'll ever go back to this location again.",

Fast service as soon as we were seated and a great welcoming smile. She was very helpful, pleasant and nice to talk to.  Made us feel like we were her only customers. It was shortly after lunch hour and it was relatively busy.  Nice to give a well deserved tip to a waitress that takes care of her customers as if they were a VIP in her book.

Another slight issue I had was the fact that the waiter messed up my order, but the manager gladly replaced it free-of-charge for me, and gave me her humble apologies. Once I received the dish I ordered - beef medallions over fettuccine alfredo - it was actually pretty tasty.

I've been at busy lunch/dinner times and have not had to wait more than 15 minutes either times. The service was AMAZING. Emika was our waitress during lunch ( 1 week ago) and Cindy was our waitress for the duration of our dinner experience (two days ago). Both were knowledgeable, friendly, and really went over and beyond.  Always replenished our breadsticks and refilled our drinks without us even asking.   During our last visit for dinner we got the 2 for $25 deal. Not one complaint. Before ordering from the menu I made sure to ask about the portion size and was reassured that they were the same as the regular dinner portions. ((( BUT, if you opt to get the appetizers instead of unlimited breadsticks and salad they would be smaller....we decied to go for the unlimited.) No disappointments with portions ( I got the Fett. Alfredo... classic...amazing...can't go wrong) It was so much that I had my leftovers for lunch the next day. My boyfriend also had to take the rest of his spaghetti home too.  The food was awesome and the service was even better. WILL BE BACK.   *** before leaving (both times) we asked for extra breadsticks so we could take them home to have with our leftovers...and there was no faces...no if ands or buts...both waitresses said no problem and brought us 4 to take home.   I highly recommend the \"strata\". it's a chocolate cake that is to die for.",

I looked online for restaurants that were still open and Olive Garden showed they were open \"today from 11:00am-11:00pm.\" So we pulled up to the door and it looked pretty deserted so I went inside to ask what time they closed. It was currently about 9:50pm. I walked in and asked one of the servers at the bar, \"What time do you close?\" She said, \"10:00 but you're more than welcome to come on in.\" I said, \"Oh, it says 11:00 online (I said this while showing her on my phone.)\" She said, \"Nope, we close at 10:00.\" I said ok as I was turning to walk out and she told me to wait while she grabbed the host so he could seat us. I said, \"No, it's ok, I feel bad for sitting this close to closing.\" She chuckled and said, \"Don't feel bad, if I were you, I wouldn't feel bad and I would go ahead and sit.\" I looked at her hesitantly and said, \"Ok.\"   So I waived to my friend to come inside and I told her what happened. She and I were both a little nervous about getting poor service. (We all know no server wants to have someone seated at their table right at closing.) When the host appeared, I asked him with a nervous laugh, \"Are we going to get bad service since it's so late?\" He said, \"No, absolutely not. You will get great service here no matter what.\"   He walked us to our table and told us our server would be right with us. She was at the table over dealing with customers who were not happy with their order. we sat down as the salad was delivered to the next table and as the waitress started putting cheese on the salad, the customer said, \"Oh, no we didn't want cheese.\" Exasperated, the waitress rolled her eyes, turned around and threw the cheese grater onto the serving tray and complained to the other server, \"I need another salad.\" So while our waitress went to retrieve a new salad, the other waitress came over to our table. Looking very disheveled and ready to go home, she said, \"What do y'all want to drink?\" We both just ordered water and knowing they were in a hurry to close, we were ready with our order when our waitress finally appeared.   I placed my dinner order and I told her I knew I was going to want desert so I asked if I should go ahead and order that now. She said yes because she would have to check to see if they even had any of the food left, thankfully they did.   Throughout the entire order, we got nothing but attitude. My lasagna fritta was cold and had maybe a spoon full of the pasta sauce. My friend's fettuccine alfredo had may two spoon fulls of alfredo sauce so she had to take some out of the cold alfredo boat I ordered for the bread sticks. While eating, our waitress was walking by and said, \"Oh, I need to go check on your cheesecake and see if we have any.\" She walked back into the kitchen and from where we were sitting we heard her yell, \"Do we got any cheesecake left?\" I guess they did because she came out and said she took it out to thaw. By the time it got to me, it was halfway thawed out and the more I ate and the further back I got into the slice, the more frozen it was.   Needless to say, we were not very pleased with the service nor the food. And I do understand it was late but if your own staff tells me it's not a big deal, not to feel bad and to go ahead and eat, I expect better service than that.",

The pasta fagioli soup is my only reason to get soup and salad for dinner because it's usually really good.    So I wrote to corp through their website and they sent me a gift certificate.  I gave this location another try and thankfully it's back to normal.  So go with caution and be prepared to deal with lackluster performance.  I love OG on the whole and give most locations at least four stars, but this one has done it's best to tarnish their image.",

    "text": "This location used to be great.  But something's gone downhill over the past couple years, and I suspect it's the management.  The staff is not being properly trained and at times they are woefully understaffed.  For example, at my most recent visit I ordered the Steak Gorgonzola Alfredo. I've order this since it was introduced to the menu, and when first introduced it was very good.  This latest one, however, was thrown together haphazardly as if the cook either wasn't trained properly or just didn't care.  The steak was supposed to be medium; instead it came well done.  The pasta was a bit dried out at the edges, as if the whole plate had sat a while under heat before serving. ( That might also explain the meat being overdone).  The Alfredo was minimal and seemed to have been ladled onto one section of the noddles, not mixed throughout.  And the balsamic reduction, instead of being placed over the meat as it should have been, was also off to the side on some of the fettuccine noodles only. So it's as if the cook knew the parts that had to be present, but didn't care at all how they were put together and just threw things on the plate. Very disappointing.",

The food is...well Olive Garden, don't come expecting amazing cuisine. That being said their quality standards were to be expected. What really made the difference was the staff, they were earnestly happy (I overheard them talking with one another). They didn't talk trash about their tables like in the movie \"Waiting\" they were the opposite.   Friendly, polite and attentive, they took their jobs seriously, which can be tough when you work at Olive Garden.  The management seems to be doing a good job of encouraging this environment, so kudos to them.",

This time the pasta e fagole was way too thick - it had crossed from soup to stew-land which was not what I came for. I hope it was just a brief short coming and not a change of recipe.  Another problem this visit is that Olive Garden has decided putting tablets in everyone's face is a really great idea. They were placed up and down the bar with bright animated images. Can we not just sit and have some peace and a little chat with the bartender or another diner? I also wonder if the cameras on the tablets are operational. It just seems intrusive.",

No one acknowledged me for at least 20 minutes and when I finally got someone they at first said that they couldn't find my name and I told them again and they finally found it. I was told it was only a few minutes and it would be ready. After waiting for 30-35 minutes I still didn't get my food and I tried to get a manager and that took 10 minutes to get.

    "text": "I am not a fan of big corporate \"Italian-style\" chain resturants, and the OG is one of my least favorites (behind Maggianos, Macaroni Grill, and Bucca di Bepo). I would never choose to go here over a locally owned place, but unfortunately, there are times that I find myself at one of these types of places for a work or social event planned by someone else.    That is how I ended up at this OG location.  There were about 15 of us, and you would think a big corporate chain like OG would be well versed in serving large groups, but on this particular visit, the service was even worse than the food (which is not very good in my opinion).  The service was PAINFULLY slow and the server(s) kept forgetting to bring items to the table.  It took forever to get drinks to the the table.  Then,  I had ordered soup with unlimited salad & breadsticks... as did several folks at the table.  With so many eating salad, it was gone in no time and it took forever to get more to the table. A couple of people didn't get their entrees at the same time, so awkwardly sat at the table waiting for food.    This attempt at lunch ended up taking  2+ hours - which is ok for a dinner event but completely unacceptable at lunch time when you have to get back to work.  The bad service coupled with the mediocre food just makes this place a big waste of time.  Next time someone plans an event here - lunch or dinner - I will just have to respectfully decline.",

Also to note one thing that I didn't like but I know can't be changed is the entrance to the location. It is a little annoying to get into. At least the manager chose to take the \"late\" food off the check so that was a plus. They also provided a large table for my party in a back corner so there wasn't many people around us. Well that's all I got for this dinner.",

When I entered the restaurant there were four people at the front desk one of which was on the phone. I stood there for at least a minute and a half and not one of the other staff asked me can I help you. Once the lady got off the phone she immediately asked me can I help you as the other staff continued to talk amongst themselves. I told her a table for two and she told me it will be about a half hour wait and gave me a buzzer. I took the buzzer and went outside and told the wife it will be a half hour wait but I didn't like how I was left unattended and I don't want to stay because of it. I took the buzzer back inside and informed the lady who gave it to me that we changed our mind and we ended up going somewhere else too eat. Service was on the back burner this night and Olive Garden lost our business. Fortunately not forever but this night, yes.",

We've been to this OG numerous times with good service. I can't say the same for this visit. Our male server had the \"shakes\" worse than patients experiencing DT's that I've cared for. Upon bringing the bottle of white wine to our table it had ice on the bottom as well as dripping water. Our friend grabbed the bottle just as it was about to hit the floor. The server never even noticed the bottle sliding off the table because of ice on the bottom nor did he notice the water he dropped all over our friends suit. He also either didn't noticed or care that he spilled red wine on the table while reaching across me to pour my husbands wine. We had to ask him three times for our pitcher of red sangria, our friend asked at least that many times for another glass of white wine which he never brought. This was a party of six adults in which he brought one bowl of salad that was maybe half full for the five who requested salad. He did bring more bread after we asked numerous times only to drop the empty basket in my lap. Never once did he ask if anyone wanted more salad or soup, very odd which by the way we did want more. Our food took over 35 minutes to come out which in the mean time he never bothered to ask if we'd like anything. The food was COLD as in ice cold!!!! All six plates clearly had sat waiting for him. One person ordered chicken meatballs, they were so over cooked it was difficult to even get the fork in it let alone slice. In passing we informed him of this he took the plate (again never asking if everything was OK or did we need anything) without saying a word. He came back 10-15 minutes later to inform us \"they were making more chicken meatballs did we mind waiting?? Yes we mind!!!! The cook should be ashamed to send anything out of that poor quality, you could tell by looking at the meatball it was as dry and hard as the desert. The server stated the meatballs would be removed from our check, guess what??? They weren't! We had planned to order desserts but our server must have been in a hurry to leave as he brought our check without even inquiring. The resturant was not busy at all, we were seated at approximately 6:45 not that there's any excuse for this type of service nor food quality. People that were seated after us were served and leaving by the time our food arrived. I now wish we'd spoke to management prior to leaving.",

It had been a while since I've visited and OG, mainly because I was tired of always ordering the same thing. But my parents were in town and wanted to stop in for dinner so I figured...why not?!?  We started with the Moscato, what I love about the wine here is that they always let you sample prior to ordering a glass and now they offer a glass and a half...whoooo hoooo! The Moscato is sweet, fruity and crisp! One of my absolute favorites!  Our appetizer was the lasagna fritta which is Parmesan breaded lasagna pieces, fried and served over Alfredo sauce topped with Parmesan cheese and marinara sauce. I must say this was a very delicious way to start the meal! The fried pieces of lasagna were hot and crispy and the two sauces and cheese were a perfect compliment! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!   We also had the Zuppa Toscana which is spicy sausage, russet potatoes and cavolo greens in a creamy breath and salad. For the meals we had Tour di Mare which has three small portions of their creamy shrimp Alfredo, shrimp scampi fritta which are a new item of lightly fried shrimp tossed in a garlic and white wine sauce! They were very good the mix of favors offers a very unique taste! We also tried the Bucatini with meat sauce. The pasta is a little thicker that spaghetti noodles but equally delicious!   Our server was outstanding and our food was delicious, I am absolutely looking forward to going back and trying some more of their new menu items!",

I come here at-least once a month,  had been in many places before moving to charlotte... so i tried different locations as well.  When compare my experience with other locations, this is 'OK', but others are 'better'.   I like my food prepared with extra sauce and requested when ordering few times, but never happened.  However, when i requested additional sauce, they provided separately.  So i am OK with that.  Service was always very good, every waiter is very friendly and talks very nice and attentive.

    "text": "I ordered a raspberry lemonade. I got 2 refills. I was seated near some high school girls who the waiter needed to fart with. That's the word I meant. He stunk. As far as food I ordered it was the never ending pasta bowl. The chef saw me walk in and sat out 5 bowls right away. My other reviews on yelp are indicative of an overweight person so needless to say 5 bowls was a good over/under. I got 2 bowls total. Whilst farting with those girls the waiter wasn't taking their order or anyone else's. So others had to wait which made my waiting even longer. I think his name is Clayton and he has a twin working there too because he had to tell the girls just everything about himself.",

    "text": "On a Sunday afternoon, fairly busy. After bringing out the wrong meal, we waited another 20 minutes for the correct order to be brought to us. In total I waited 45 minutes from when we sat down until I got my foos. Another oddity was that whenever the breadsticks were brought out there were three. Not a huge deal but strange, as if they wanted us to fight over the other breadstick.   The food was good as always, but the service was disappointing.",
