    "text": "There's a lot to love about Zada Jane's.  The sweetness-and-light decor, the localish menu, the fact they generally have someone who knows something about coffee manning the cappuccino machine.  The jelly comes in a squeeze bottle from 'Imladris Farms'.  Elves make their jelly, it's True.  The food always sounds fantastic on the menu, letting you know which co-op produced which animal you're about to devour-and it's impossible to deny that the local-food and slow-food snobs .. er .. aficionados eat that stuff up.  Especially, in this case, the slow-food folks.  They should have nothing at all to complain about, because this chow creeps along as if they're out killing the pig by the dumpster.  Let's talk about hipsters for a minute, shall we?  There are hipsters for every category; most of us are familiar with the 'scene hipster', overly conscious about trends, which bars are the dive-y-ist, they like bands you've never heard of.  These are not the only stripe of hipster.  Enter the 'foodie hipster'.  They know all these great local places you've never heard of, they refuse to eat at chain restaurants because they want to support the local community, they want gluten-free organic farm-raised low-fat cuisine with a vegetarian option.  They watch Iron Chef and feel bad that they like foi gras, but it's just so delicious.  Zada Janes is the foodie hipster scene in exactly the same way that any given late-night diner belongs to the scenester.  It hits all their buttons; they don't care how long they have to wait or how terrible the service is or how inconsistent the food quality is, because it's local and neighborly and they get to know the name of the pig.  If you find yourself watching 'Chopped' or reading about 'sustainable farming' despite never setting foot on freshly tilled soil, you will absolutely ADORE Zada Jane's.  For the rest of us, here's the actual review:  The food is usually good, but can be inconsistent.  The service is universally terrible, and the service staff will give you the impression that they're on the morning shift because they're still awake, still drunk, and plan on sleeping it off after 5pm.    Your order is like as not to be wrong, and while you're waiting for the correction (or even a drink refill) you can write the Great American Novel.  It's a hip brunch spot, so either get in before 10am, or be prepared to fight a horde of noisy children for the shuffleboard and cornhole out front.    If you plan on getting coffee while you wait the gentle eternity it will take to get you seated, bring a mug.  The line is often 30 people, and there are maybe a dozen mugs to go around.  The seating is cramped, many of the tables are tiny, and you are like to be jostled.  Any suggestion on the done-ness of your eggs might as well be a prayer to Odin.  All that said: if you can get there at an off-peak time, don't mind paying a premium price for knowing where your grits were grown, and are fine with hanging around for a couple of hours, there's a good chance you'll have an acceptable dining experience.",

    "text": "I was super excited to check out Zada Janes but not so super excited after waiting 45 minutes for my food!  That's right - 45 minutes.  So first things first, Zada is a very cute place.  The outside patio is located on a corner so you can eat and people watch all at the same time!  The menu has very unique options.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with sundried tomatoes, caramelized onions and mozzarella cheese served on foccacia bread and my side was the black eye pea salad.  The food was quite delicious!  That is, when we finally got it.    Here is the scoop on the service.  We walked in and then immediately following us 2 other groups of people walk in.  The waitress takes their order first even though we had arrived earlier!  No biggie, I thought.  Well...I was wrong.  After waiting 25 minutes all the other tables had their food.  I waited another 10 minutes.  I finally got so heated that I walked in to find the server and politely told her that we had been waiting nearly 40 minutes for our food and that people who arrived after us had their meal.  Her response was \"Sorry about that. We have a small kitchen.  I'll see what I can do about it.\"  We got our food about 7-8 minutes afterward.  In addition to having a long wait, my glass stood empty for long periods of time.  I could tell by the looks on other people's faces that they were in similar boats!    Given the circumstances, and my complaint, I thought maybe they would comp one of our meals or even my friend's drink.  Maybe offer a free dessert?  Just something  to say - hey, I know you didn't have the best experience tonight.  Well, we got nothing! With that being said, I'm not headed back anytime soon.  Not to mention, after reading other reviews, I'm not alone in my terrible service experience!",

I love their blend of southern classics (grits, biscuits) with southwestern options and vegan and vegetarian options. And best of all, they support local vendors when they can. Zada Janes has something for everyone.   When I sat outside with my dog, a waiter came up to ask if he needed water and brought over a bucket. I'm just as happy inside, where the purple walls and funky art make me feel at home.   Fair warning: Service can be a little slow when they're packed, but go early or late and you shouldn't have an issue.",

On weekends, there is usually a wait for a table, but we always wait - it's that good.  The bunny rancheros dish is fantastic, and their biscuits are big and fluffy (and much better than Flying Biscuit).  I like the fact that you can take any of their omelets and wrap them into a yummy burrito instead.  Also don't forget to check the board for specials -- sometimes they have berry pancakes which are absolutely delicious.  Service is usually quick and always friendly.  We like to sit around the bar and chat with Jodie. She remembers our favorite dishes and drinks, and is super nice.  If you like specialty coffees, try the frappabeano in the summer - it's an iced coffee drink that tastes like a milkshake!  The brown sugar cinnamon cappuccino is also pretty good.    One word of warning - Zada's parking lot is small, so arrive early (or extra late) if you don't want to have to hunt for a spot on the street.",

    "text": "Zada Jane's is the typical funky, eco-friendly restaurant that every big city needs. As usual, it is located in the hipster district and caters to many environmentally conscious eaters on an artist's buck. I tried a few of their breakfast offerings to see what they really had to offer.  The service and atmosphere is nice and friendly, but the grub needs some work. I like that they source locally, but I did not like the texture of my morning items.  My French toast resembled bread with a rubbery coating. It was not super crisp, but it was not super moist. It was just like eating a piece of thick bread that had some egg batter on it.  The sweet potato browns were gross, but not in a terrible way. They were just not very appetizing for $3.25. Sure, you get a large plate, but they were soggy... straight up moist and soft. It was nothing more than overbaked cubes of (probably chopped up yesterday) orange tuber. Some pieces were burnt, others were just floppy.  The biscuit was somewhat dry and dense, but the Grateful Growers sausage made it all the better. The locally sourced pork product was juicy and extremely spicy, just how I like my ground swine. The Imladris Farm apple butter and blackberry jam also improve the rather boring biscuit.  ZJ's is an institution to visit if you are into the cool little California style eatery, but I would go for something other than the typical breakfast fare. Perhaps they make a mean omelet; that is what everyone seems to be raving about.",

I had ordered the Hummus salad and it was far more than I had bargained for. A massive plate hit my table with a scrumptious salad on the left side, hummus and couscous in separate ramekins sat in the center, while an array of toasted pita bread fanned out the right side of the plate. Couldn't even get through a third of it before feeling like I was going to explode. The prices weren't too bad here either.

    "text": "Oh, how I love the idea of organic, healthy and delicious food all wrapped up in one cool location...and Zada Jane's does a fine job of it. I've been once for breakfast and just hit it up for dinner the other night. Some tips:   1. Parking on a weekend can be a hot mess, especially at breakfast time. Be sure to NOT park behind the \"No Grease Barber Shop\" or you will be towed (as the sign in parking lot attests).   2. The food is delicious. If you visit in the fall, be sure to order the pumpkin pancakes - they're the best I've ever had (and I'm a bit of a pumpkin aficionado, so that's saying a lot). For dinner I got the Druthers Clucking Chicken Panini with a side salad. The foccacia bread and tomato spread on this panini were delish. Be sure to note that you will get a $2 up-charge on the side salad which you are not warned about on the menu - but to be honest, the home made dressing was so good that I didn't mind.   3. The restaurant has a very cool vibe but is quite small inside, so if the weather doesn't permit outside seating, you could have a wait. Be sure to warn the wait staff if you're in a hurry or they'll leave you on your own for a bit (not a bad thing if you're catching up with friends; would be bad if you're on a quick lunch break).   All in all, two solid dining experiences. And the fact that they support local farmers makes me like it just that little bit more. If you've not been, I suggest you try it.",

Like most breakfast spots in Charlotte, there can be a long wait for a table on the weekends. The servers are friendly, but it can also take a while to get your food.  If you've got the time, it's well worth the wait.  Try the fluffy french toast topped with almonds or Bunny Rancheros, a combination of fried eggs, black beans and your choice of meat, topped with cheese, guacamole, salsa verde and cilantro crema, and served with warm flour tortillas.  Zada Jane's offers some great vegetarian options, which can be a rare find in Charlotte.   The patio is perfect for people-watching on Central Avenue and you can play shuffleboard outside while you wait.  I recently tried Zada Jane's for dinner. While the dinner menu is pricier and more limited, they also had some breakfast and lunch favorites available. I got the delicious veggie sandwich and my boyfriend loved the shrimp and grits.",

    "text": "I'm usually not a complainer, but brace yourselves because that is exactly what I am about to do. Me and my husband decided to stop in for a quick breakfast last Thursday. We had been here a few times before and love the atmosphere so we figured it would be a quick place to stop in before we had to work. We got there and were waved to find a seat wherever, which isn't out of the usual so we sat in the last booth by the kitchen door. We sat for at least 5-6 minutes before we were even acknowledged, got drink orders, etc. Now me and my husband both worked in the restaurant industry, so we understand, sometimes there is more going on than meets the eye.  So silently we waited another 7-8 minutes for our drinks to arrive (two coffees and an orange juice, in the morning those should be pretty standard) We placed our order when she brought us back our drinks and this is where the fun begins. So we both ordered standard menu options, no substitutions, nothing crazy. We sat there waiting for our food, watching our surroundings as we do everywhere and it seemed like the servers were more into their little server drama than actually giving us service. There was a girl with a UFO tattoo who couldn't stay off here phone. Even went to where the bathrooms are and decided to make a phone call. When she realized a guest was approaching the restrooms she immediately went into the woman's restroom and made the guest wait outside of it until she was done talking so the guest could use it. Ridiculous. The food runner looked like she had poor hygiene and honestly didn't want her touching my food and I am NOT the kind of person that typically thinks that. But when it look like hair hasn't been washed in weeks, and I can see underwear through thin leggings, its pretty gross (to me). It was honestly just awful. And to make things worse, we watched two tables come in after us, get their drinks, food, and almost be ready for their bills before our food even came to the table. We waited about 45 minutes before my husband told our \"waitress\" that we couldn't wait any longer and we just wanted to pay for our drinks otherwise we would be late for work. You could tell the server wasn't even fazed by this at all, she said \"well you don't have to pay for your drinks\" OKAY?? you think the 5 dollars in drinks is what were disputing??? Like that's the best you can do? not \"oh I'm so sorry, let me rush that and get it to go\", or \"let me take care of breakfast next time\", or even \"let me go grab my manager\"! Absolutely ridiculous. While we were for our food we knew something had went wrong with it because of the number of servers looking over at our table. but NO ONE SAID A WORD. That is the industry your in. Service. if you cant provide it, go bag groceries down the street. I will definitely not ever go back here. If I were the owners of this establishment, I would go into damage control mode quick. Because you don't want the executive chef of a major charlotte restaurant bad mouthing your restaurant........",

The atmosphere is nice though. It's very relaxed and calm. The staff is sweet and helpful. There's a nice outside space that is always packed on sunny mornings. It's definitely hipster lol, but definitely cool. The mimosas are delish and was the saving grace. I'd pass and just cook at home next time.  Edit: I ate the biscuit and it was delicious. The jam was pretty bomb too. I think maybe because it was cold inside and I had to rush to eat my food made the experience less enjoyable. A lot of people come here. I can't imagine that many people have bad tastebuds.",

Waitress was quick with menus and drink order - and THAT is where it STOPPED!  My husband order the Druther's Clucker sandwich, and I ordered the No-Da salad. Now, my salad comes with baked marinated tofu, but I asked to leave off the tofu and replace with ahi-tuna. Since my salad came with tofu, which is $3.25 if you add it to any other salad, I ASSUMED (my fault!) that I would only be charged the difference between what tofu cost as an add-on and what the ahi-tuna cost as an add-on - which is $5.50. WRONG - we ended up having to pay full $5.50 because manager gave lame excuse that it was \"sushi-grade tuna!\"   Now before we ever got our bill and saw the above mentioned charge - we were already irritated because the WAIT for our food to finally arrive was ridiculous!!!  After we got drinks, we waited for a full 35 mins before that mgr came by and said \"I just checked on your order, your food will be out in \"2 more minutes!\"  Well, 10 mins after that - we STILL had not received our food and I even asked husband if he was ready to just leave when it finally showed up!  My salad wasn't bad, but since it ended being a $14.45 salad - it was nowhere worth that!   My husband said that his sandwich and sweet potato browns were terrible - the chicken was so overcooked, it was tough, dry and like jerky. Also, his said that the sweet potato browns were like left-over sweet potatoes that they tried to make something good out of, and totally failed. We did not have a good first-time experience at all - I can't understand why people seem to like this place.",

The service was horrible. Our waitress took our drink order, then came back 2 minutes later and took our food order (bunny rancheros and egg & cheese biscuit), then we set there for 30 minutes without so much as a hello. At that point, she came by to say our food would be out in a \"couple of minutes\". Long story short, our food came out exactly 51 minutes after we ordered. I don't know where that type of wait is acceptable, especially when your server checks on you twice during the wait, but it wasn't for us.  The food was okay overall (I would say 3/5 stars), but the presentation looked sloppy, and the portion was awful - three or four total homefries and maybe a handful of beans and chicken. For your own sake, I would definitely avoid Zada Jane's! The food was mediocre, the service was not friendly, and the wait was agonizing!",

    "text": "Zada Jane's is an adorable neighborhood cafe.  I've heard about it for years since my sister and her fiance go there often for brunch.  They love it so much that they named their dog after it!  Well, recently, I finally got to try it out for myself!    Molly S. and I wandered in for some afternoon brunch on a weekday so it wasn't as busy as I bet it probably is on a weekend.  She ordered the Bunny Rancheros.  It seems that this is her favorite dish to order.  She also had a latte and the waitress was so cute when she said she tried to make a really cool design in it, but it didn't quite turn out how she envisioned it.    I ordered the Grande Quande which is the Basic Breakfast, plus one, big fluffy pancake.  What does The Zada Jane 28205 Basic Breakfast encompass?  Two happy eggs, choice of one protein, one carb, plus toast or a TLC bisquit.  Molly advised me right away to go for the biscuit over toast.  So I ordered my two eggs over medium, their Local Grateful Growers sausage, Sweet Potato Browns, and the biscuit.  The pancake was the perfect size and they got my eggs just right medium -- a little run, but not too much.  The sausage had a little spicy kick to it, but just right.  The sweet potatoes were good, but seemed to lack flavor so when heated them up at home later on I added some butter and a little brown sugar to fix 'em up.  The biscuit also seemed to lack some flavor.  I thought it was a little hard too so maybe it had been sitting out a while.  Overall, I was very happy with my meal too.    Our waitress was super sweet and friendly and the decor of this cafe is a delight.  I also love that they have local art for sale, a patio for when it's warm, and their own Zada Jane cornhole boards.  I would definitely go back next time I'm in town.",

Came here on a Saturday around 11:15. Were seated in about 15 minutes. We let our server know that we were in a bit of a hurry (bf had an appointment at 12:30 in Southend, leaving us about 45 minutes to eat) and she put our food in right when we ordered. After waiting about 25 minutes, we went ahead and paid and our server said our food would be right out. 10 minutes after that, we had to hunt down our server and have her pack up our food to go. She brought it to us a few minutes later and offered no apology for the wait. My boyfriend ate his food in the car and I'm standing at my kitchen counter alone eating mine.  There is no reason on this earth for 2 omelets to take 35 minutes to come out of the kitchen. The fact that we were in a hurry has little to do with it. We were seated with the kitchen door in our line of vision, and there were about 2 dishes coming out every 5 minutes. Are you serious? I'm also not picky about getting an apology, and I know it was not our server's fault, but I was surprised that she showed no concern.  My food is fine, albeit a bit cold since it's been in a to-go container. And while I love my boyfriend's cat, she's not great breakfast company.",

Not a bad wait for brunch at such a popular spot! There was corn hole and shuffleboard out front to help pass the time. All tables on the patio had umbrellas for some shade and relief from the heat. I was excited to see that \"seasonal\" coffee flavors (i.e. gingerbread, pumpkin, peppermint, etc.) are served year round. Always added points in my book!   I must admit I was a little disappointed with my meal. I ordered a basic create your own omelet with turkey bacon, mushrooms, spinach and cheese. When my plate came out, I had an omelet with a TON (never thought you could have too much, but it was pushing it) of turkey bacon and cheese only. I was told that they ran out of spinach and mushrooms, but was not informed until I was served something other than what I ordered. I understand that later in the day you run the risk of running out of ingredients. However, you would expect the courtesy of being notified before they prepare your meal so that you can change your order accordingly. It was rather underwhelming.   Two of the others in our group had been before and highly recommended there. One had ordered a chicken sandwich that she previously had gotten and loved and was a little disappointed this time.. so maybe the restaurant was just having an all around off day. Another in our party got the bunny rancheros which they were very happy with. That seems to be their tried and True menu item. The biscuits and seasoned potatoes (side dish) were very tasty!",

    "text": "It's hard for me to only give Zada Jane's a 1-star review, because my husband and I have relatively enjoyed our experiences here thus far. But after yesterday, I have to say this place has probably been taken off our list of regular spots.   We decided to stop in on a Sunday afternoon for a bit of brunch before our 3 o'clock appointment. 2 hours should have been plenty of time, right? Apparently not. We were told the wait for a table would be about 20 minutes; 45 minutes later we were finally sat, after watching several tables remain empty on the patio the entire time we waited. Given those 45 minutes, we had plenty of time to look over the menu so we could put in our order right away. By the time we ordered our drinks and food (at the same time) it was about 2 o'clock.   By 2:30, I'd had enough. Our waitress didn't check on us the entire time we sat there. 40 minutes without a table touch... 30 MINUTES. We finally tracked her down and told her we needed our food to-go, as we had somewhere to be. She assured us she'd go check on our food and have them put it together as quickly as possible. But this seems to be relative, as 10 minutes later she returns and tells us it'll be another 5 minutes before our food could be brought out. Unfortunately at this point, we'd already decided to pay the bill preemptively because, despite everything, we were hungry. Bad move on our part, I will say.   Finally, our food was brought out by (what I assumed to be) a manager, because she gave us a gift certificate for our trouble. However, this seemed to be only an afterthought when my husband brought up how long we'd had to wait for a table and for our food on top of that. I felt it should have been our waitress that tracked down a manager for that sort of thing.   On top of all of that, they put the wrong ingredients in my husband's order of the Bunny Rancheros. If the food was fantastic, I might be inclined to give them another chance. But, unfortunately, it's a bit average, and the headache is not worth it. Guess we'll have to find someone else to use our $25 certificate. Any takers?",

I really do - the atmosphere is so chill, the outdoor patio is great, the wait staff is friendly and for some reason it's always jam packed, which always makes me think I'm missing out on serious deliciousness inside.   But such is not the case. Full disclosure, we came 30 minutes before official close on Memorial Day, so maybe we got the \"230 treatment\", but still. It took 40 MINUTES for us to get our food. HANGER. I got the Booker T hash. The cheese was quite literally a congealed orange blob over the eggs which were so overcooked the damn thing was brown.  My husband got some Grande breakfast, and you could tell they cooked the eggs and sausage first, then probably burnt the pancake and had to re-do the pancake while the other food sat there. Because the eggs and sausage were cold mush by the time they came out...and Redo Pancake was STILL burnt!   So we're grading off breakfast only, and they do offer Lunch and Dinner options. But IMHO, if you claim to specialize in breakfast and ya can't get eggs or pancakes right, I sure wouldn't risk my money on the rest of the menu.   We'll continue to leave ZJ out of our CLT breakfast rotation. Maybe next year!",

It was decently sized cut of meat that really tasted great.  The acorn squash side was awesome.  The fresh green beans were also great. My wife had the wild mushroom ravioli $16.  First thing she noticed that each ravioli was charred.  I think the cook had that planned because much of the food was charred (to me in a good way).   Her ravioli needed to have more portion size, she was still hungry after finishing it.",

The food is very fresh and tasty. This most recent time I went with the simple Zada Janes breakfast. Eggs cooked perfectly to order, a delicious melt in your mouth biscuit with homemade jams, tasty turkey sausage and delicious herb roasted potatoes, what more could A person ask for. In the past I have tried the nachos, amaretto French toast, and the Brooker Ts East Side Hash. All of which were very tasty. Service is always friendly, but not always fast, which is the only downfall.but once you get a biscuit and load it with jam you will forget all your worries and sigh a sigh of pure delight. See for yourself I dare you.",

Probably because they can;t serve people in a timely manner.  What's more disappointing; when you get the food it's nothing special anymore.

So, Zada Jane's does have gluten-friendly going for them (our waitress really was very knowledgeable about gluten).  Overall though, I was not impressed with the cafe. We waited for a table (that's fine, brunch is popular), but I honestly don't understand why so many people were there. The food is mediocre, albeit priced affordably. And the service was very, very slow without any explanation or warning that there would be a wait. My understanding is that this is normally a popular breakfast/brunch spot, so I would think they would be used to the volume. However, all three individuals in my party ordered a basic breakfast plate and we waited an hour for our food to come out.  After waiting an hour, I was unimpressed to find that my sweet potatoes were under-cooked. They had great potential as a dish, but it turns out not-so-great when they're a little crunchy. Thankfully I like my biscuits under-cooked, so my doughy, fluffy biscuit was a two thumbs up. The eggs were fine, but the soysage was actually worse than the frozen kind I buy at the grocery store.  Honestly, the price is so great compared to the mass of snooty brunch places in town that I may come back when I need that basic breakfast fix. But if you're looking for a decent culinary experience, I would look elsewhere.",

    "text": "I'd only ever eaten here for breakfast in the past. When we hit 1-hour plus waits at Pizza Peel and Workman's last night, we wandered in to Zada Janes. While there was no wait at 8:30pm and my party of 6 was seated immediately, the place wasn't dead either.   Their dinner menu offers a nice variety -- everything from $8-$12 sandwiches and salads to $20-$30 entrees. Their beer and wine list is average. They had 2 local beers on draught and lots more in bottles/cans. Because we were feeling a little feisty and you can never go wrong with bubbles, we went with a bottle of prosecco. I ordered the green mind melt (a veggie sandwich) with Mac & Cheese as the side. The sandwich lacked seasoning and was just ok (maybe a C+) but the Mac & cheese was really good (solid A). I mean, the Mac had bacon. It had to be good, right?! The table shared chicken and shrimp nachos. Both yummy! The addition of zucchini and squash was a unique touch and made us all feel a little better about killing two plates of nachos.   Zada Janes has some stiff competition in the Plaza Midwood area but I remain a fan, especially when facing a long wait at other spots nearby. It's a good, neighborhood joint. Wait staff are super friendly and personable. The atmosphere is laid back and relaxed.",

I just can't enjoy going there anymore.",

Wait staff: We had a STELLAR woman helping us out. Very animated, very honest, very attentive. When she checked in after receiving our food, she immediately remarked that my dish was missing something (I was none the wiser) and brought out two sauce options. That said, those I dined with (seasoned Zada Jane goers) said the staff can be hit or miss - so keep that in mind.   Food: Pretty mixed. What I had was not good - a falafel special. I got THREE falafel balls (barely anything) on top of a sparse \"bed\" of sprouts, with 6 wedges of pita to dip in an enormous cup of hummus. Waitress brought me tahini and a delicious lemon aioli for dipping. The dish was just too small and odd. It should be on a bed of lettuce, or within an actual pita if they want to make it a sandwich. Every other dish at the table looked delicious: a custom omelet (it was enormous!), the bunny rancheros, and the valid spinach salad. So I will be trying one of those next time!  Overall: Not thrilled, but I'm definitely going back to try out some different options.",

    "text": "Unfortunately I have to give Zada Jane a one star. I was so excited about experiencing this place after my friends had been texting me all morning to join them for brunch. Though they had finished by the time I arrived I still wanted to give the place a try. After reading the yelp reviews, looking at al the yummy Yelp photos I as totally in!   After walking the Juneteenth festival I walked over and saw no one was sitting in the patio but there were LOTS of receipt books laying out from previous guest. {not good someone could have stolen these receipts and or cash if any were left. I use to work in finance bank fraud so my red flags went up}. I went inside to ask if they would be servicing the patio. The lady said yes and someone would be right with me, and that I could select and table I wanted. I did just that facing the festival.   After waiting for 15minutes and no one coming out I decided to go inside to see what the hold up could be. Just as I was walking through the door a server comes running out. Apologizing that she was just heading out. I said it was ok, and told myself I would stay and order because I was extremely hungry. She provided me with a menu and a glass of water. I asked if she could give me about 4minutes to review the menu and I would be ready. I SPECIFICALLY asked for only 4minutes because I was so hungry and it had already taken 15minutes for someone to acknowledge me. Another 15 minutes go by and at that point I had enough. I left everything in the table including the untouched water and walked away. Not sure how long after that it took for them to notice I was gone but. I'm truly upset I didn't get to experience this place. The reviews in here are great, my friends swear by it and the $14 bottle of champagne for brunch, and how the servers know who they are as soon as they walk in and fills them with drinks. So unfortunate that I did not receive that same service.",

This past weekend, I just wasn't feeling that so I ran through the nearby spots in my head and picked Zada Jane's Corner Cafe for my next meal. My husband and I arrived at 9 so the first wave of diners had already breezed through. We opted for cappuccino and a hot tea. I was impressed with how hot my coffee stayed. Our server gave my husband an extra hot water half way through the meal to get another cup out of that loose leaf tea. Nice! Its cold next to those brick walls on a chilly day so that was much appreciated.  I opted to piece a breakfast together which I normally do. Got two eggs over easy, bacon and a biscuit with herb gravy. I looove that gravy. It's loaded with thyme. Mmmm. Bacon more crisp than I make it for myself but who cares when the rest is so satisfying?  We had great service and left nice and full!  Cozy up to the sit at counter if there is a wait.",

    "text": "With Zada Jane's being one of the few brunch-type places in the Plaza Midwood area, this place always has a LONG wait.  It's not because the food is amazing, it's because the service is so slow...everywhere.  The servers are often nowhere to be found, and one time I sat at the bar and everyone was frustrated because the person assigned to this area would be completely inattentive for 15-20 minutes at a time.  It also took us about 45 minutes to get our food once the order was put in, which is way too long.  Then I got my Omelette (got the special of the day with buffalo meat) and it was pretty bad.  The eggs were beyond overcooked and there was literally orange grease all over my plate seeping out of the omelette.  I had them remake it and the second one was just as bad.  The first time I went, they also messed up my order and didn't give me a breakfast burrito.  I did have a salad there one time, which was good.  Maybe that's a sign that I should stay away from their breakfast food???  It's clear that the people are working hard (both servers and kitchen staff), but this place just can't handle the volume with the current staff.  I would only go here if you're looking to have an incredibly leisurely, catch-up breakfast with a friend and you're not in a rush.  A lot of people like this place, so I say give it a try!  You just won't see me there anymore...third time was NOT a charm.",

The \"signature\" plate of Bunny Rancheros was terrible. The potatoes were greasy and mushy, the black beans dumped out of a can, the chipotle chicken was dry and overcooked and the over easy eggs were undercooked. It was truly a flavorless and visually unappealing mess.  My friend added a pancake to his meal and it was rubbery.   Decor may have been cute 10 years ago but the place looks tired and the food certainly doesn't make up for it.  Given the amazing number of other breakfast and brunch spots, I was amazed that there was a wait for tables. I can't say I'll be heading back - there are so many other great breakfast spots around CLT!",

I saw in other reviews they experienced the same thing, its like if they told you it was a hour wait then they know you would leave, so they tell you 30-40 min, thinking it wont be so bad.  I felt like I saw more people waiting for their food than actually eating it therefore making the table turnaround extremely slow.  But the food is amazing once it makes it to your table but be careful as they will also up-charge you for certain sides, even though it makes it seem like a side is included with your entree.  Parking is not as bad as other reviews have made it out to be, yes their parking lot is small but there are walk-able lots nearby.  Also love the use of different kinda of coffee mugs, cute place. Next time I go back I will make sure I have the whole afternoon available...",

I began to doubt my choice to add this to the Sunday Brunch exploration list, but we went for it anyway because of a couple friends' recommendations.  There must've been some pretty grumpy people for all the 3 star reviews. I had an amazing experience here. Short wait (We were seated within probably 10 minutes of getting there), and we got a table outside in the patio filled with puppies and hipsters. Man, I adore Plaza.  Our waitress was kind and attentive. The manager came up to us about 10 minutes into our wait and preemptively apologized about the wait for food. It did take a while, however, because we were warned, I won't deduct a star. I get it, it's a popular place, kitchens get busy. I ordered the Booker T's East Side Hasher and it was fantastic. Sweet, salty, and honestly, super unique. I've never had anything like that before.  The lady ordered The East-Western, and loved it as well. We both got a side of their biscuit with herbed gravy (instead of sausage) and that was stellar as well.   The brunch prices weren't bad at all, we came out under $25 together. When you compare that to some other prix fixe places, that's impressively cheap for two. We'll definitely be back, but we have a couple of other places to check out before we start making second-rounds again!",

    "text": "I'm a newbie to the Plaze Midwood area, but I have already been to Zada Jane's twice.  I refuse to go back, though.  The first time was a few months ago on an early Saturday afternoon.  It wasn't that busy, so there were only two servers.  Service was semi-prompt, nothing too worrisome at the time.  What stood out most was the server who acted like she did not want to be there.  She wasn't exactly rude, but she was a downer and really killed any vibe of having a good experience.  They also couldn't make an iced coffee.  Seriously?  No ice cubes?  Whatever, I moved on and ordered lunch.  It took almost 30 minutes!!  The food was decent, which is why they get 2-stars instead of 1-star.  My friend came into town and we decided to get breakfast on a Tuesday morning.  I decided to give it a try again because they had good selections and it was close.  We walked in and told to seat ourselves.  Then we waited.....a long time.  It was almost 10 minutes and nobody even came to our table.  No menus.  Nothing.  My friend agreed that it was ridiculous and we took a couple minutes to look for other places.  In that time, nobody still came to our table.  We got up and started walking out when the woman behind the bar saw me leaving.  I shook my head at her and she didn't even say anything.  She just let me walk out.  That woman, by the way, was the same woman who was a debbie downer the first time I was at Zada Jane's.  I think she's the owner, but I think she should take herself off the schedule or become a silent partner.  In the end, I don't ever want to go back to Zada Jane's.  I truly think it is managed poorly and until that leadership changes, I urge you to look at other options before going in there.",

That's usually a good sign and it is True here since the food is really tasty. However, the coffee quality suffered and the service was a bit spotty the last time we went. Back to the food - omelettes are tasty and french toast for kids is a hit. Love the character of the various types of staff here (tattoos, piercings, etc.) just means they're a good eclectic bunch - they're busting their tails in and out of the kitchen and they definitely work hard for their pay!!",

With so much great competition in Plaza Midwood restaurants cannot afford to let things like this slide.

We were told the wait was 30 minutes, so 25 minutes later when we came back to check-in, we were told it was another 25 minutes. It was suggested that we could order our food to-go and eat it outside on the deck. We decided to go with this route, even though it took another 15 minutes to place our order and pay for it. The food came pretty fast, and waiting near the cash register counter put us right next to the espresso stand. What are two people to do but order some espresso?   My companion ordered a veggie omelet with a side of potatoes and a biscuit that looked soooo fluffy and steamy and tempting. Unfortunately, I can't do potatoes or biscuits, so I was thrilled to find that Zada Jane's offered loads of other types of breads. I ordered a veggie sandwich on millet rye instead of the recommended foccacia, and had the black-eyed pea salad on the side. While the bread got super soggy from the delicious grilled eggplant and squash, it was tasty all the same! Even the black-eyed pea salad, which I usually don't like but I thought I'd try, was very yummy. All conversation screeched to a halt for 15 minutes while we stuffed our faces out on the patio. We managed to garner a lot of envious looks from a few dozen people waiting for their tables.   Definitely recommend!",

If we're talking breakfast, ZJ's is definitely 4-5 stars.  But I'm talking dinner today.  Sigh.  We visited Zada Jane's for dinner last night, and it was much calmer than it usually is for breakfast.  We were greeted and seated immediately, and upon reviewing the menu, I was a little disappointed.  It's primarily $7-$10 sandwiches/wraps, and entrees that cost wayyyy more than you'd expect.  To me, ZJ's has a cool diner atmosphere, yet their entrees were $15-$28 for dishes like spinach ravioli and chicken.  Yowza.  I was also keenly aware of the 90 sanitation rating when choosing my dinner.    We settled on the fried squash and zucchini cakes for an appetizer, and they were absolutely delicious, as was the tangy tzatziki that came with them.  I got Carmen's Spinach Salad for dinner, which was solid, and my fella got the Druthers Chicken sandwich, which he said was okay but a little bland.  All in all, you couldn't keep me away for breakfast, but dinner?  Eh.",

Fortunately, we didn't have much of an issue finding parking on the street and we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a party of 4.  It was beautiful outside so I truly didn't mind the wait!  The brunch menu was solid and reasonably priced.  I was looking for a protein-packed meal and found what I was looking for in moments...It was a huge frittata-style scramble with my choice of protein (I opted for the applewood bacon), sweet potato hash and it was served with one of their biscuits...it was all absolutely wonderful!  I literally ate every crumb.  Granted, we were coming in for a post-workout meal and I was super hungry so I don't know if my view was distorted a bit but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  The sweet potato hash could easily become addicting.  They have already made their way into a couple of my daydreams.    The service was just eh.  The waitress was slow, the food took forever to come out she botched our checks...but all is forgiven thanks to the sweet potato mash.  The atmosphere is fun, hipster and trendy--adorable place.  I guess as others have mentioned...just know before you go...parking sucks, the wait is brutal and the service may be slow..then you won't be shocked upon arrival and can hopefully just enjoy the sweet potato mash uninhibited.  I will no doubt be back..probably this weekend...did I mention the sweet potato mash?",

    "text": "As a new resident of Charlotte (moved here in April 2014) , and living within a 5 minute walk of the restaurant, we were very excited about Zada Jane's.  Reading the reviews and talking to new friends in the area, I was expecting the restaurant to be nothing less than good.....However, after 4 visits, I AM DONE WITH THIS PLACE.  Our first experience was breakfast.  We were excited about their local food, especially the local sausage.  I ordered a breakfast sandwich with the local sausage.  I was shocked when I got a flat sandwich with dry bread, and over-cooked egg, and 1 small (about a half-dollar size) piece of sausage.  The sandwich was something I could make myself....and honestly would do a better job.  It was very disappointing, but I tried to be positive and chalked it up to a bad day for the cooks. (As a note, I ordered it again a few weeks later to see, and it was even worse).  My wife ordered the hash and it was good, so that prompted us to try Zada's again.  Since that time, I have been back three times, excluding the experiment on the second breakfast sandwich.  The second time I went, I ordered two breakfast burritos.  Being originally from Arizona, I have a pretty high standard for burritos.  Zada's did not even come close.  Food was bland, and took a lot of salsa to enjoy.  Oh and I was charged $30.00. (Tried to get a refund after, but because we paid cash we were unable to prove it.)   After that it was my wife asking to try them again, since the place is so close to our home.  I was surprised one time to get a decent tofu salad (and I hate tofu).  However, I got the wrong order (a sandwich).  Rather than ask them to re-do it, I stuffed down the wrong food and left as fast as possible.  I blame them for getting the order wrong, but me for not getting it fixed.    The straw that broke the camels back came about 2 weeks ago.  In a last attempt to try this place one more time, we placed a to-go order.  My wife, who had learned her lesson, ordered the tofu salad again....and it was good.  I tried the crab-cake sandwich and it was the worst meal yet.  Dry meat, frozen crumbly bread, no flavor.  I honestly hate to say this, but the frozen crab cakes from Costco are way better.  I will say the restaurant atmosphere is nice, but not so much so I have to go there.  It's a good location with a patio and outdoor games.....whoopy!!! (sarcasm).  Try at your own risk, but do not feel you have to like this place because a bunch folks pump it up.  To note, I rarely ever write reviews, and usually in the positive.  This place is that over-hyped to me, I felt the need to do so....it's not good food (PERIOD)",

Not to mention any one who lost their spot on the list was immediately given a table after returning. Once we were sat after a walk in customer, it took nearly another 25 minutes for our DRINK. Not even worth the food the customer experience is AWFUL.",

Another understated and quaint spot that seems to be a staple of its neighborhood has both great ambiance with a lively staff and delicious food to back it up (with vegetarian vegan and gluten free options as well). While enjoying my brunch I sat at the bar and got talking to the bartender and another staff member (Tabitha and Courtney y'all are the absolute best) and they made me feel loved like a regular right away. Additionally, I got the Bunny Rancheros with chorizo for brunch (with an extra side of queso because treat yo self) and WOW was my stomach happy. If you're looking for a casual, delicious, and welcoming way to start off your day, there is no doubt in my mind this is the spot. Not enough cafes like this exist anymore. So happy to have been able to go while visiting.",

I was always unsure of what they served and hesitant when seeing the place, but I must say it definitely proved me wrong. We came here for brunch after drooling over the pics of dishes online. We were sold with the steal they had on bottles of champagnes for mimosas. It was more than enough and could barely finish the bottle between the two of us. As far as food, I ordered the Belvedere with sweet potato mash, and a side caesar salad. The omelette was amazing! The sweet potato mash? Not so much kind of just left that alone. The Caesar salad was great after I picked all the sun dried tomatoes out because they were a bit overwhelming. Nonetheless, as crazy as it sounds I was still very much so satisfied with my meal and experience. We had great service from the bartender Tab. She kept us laughing and was on point with everything we needed. I see why this place is highly recommended and I can't wait to return to make use of their outdoor area.",

I opted for the huevos rancheros and it was different than others I've had. More like an omelet with grilled chicken, black beans and pepper jack cheese, but topped with pico and sour cream. That's not what I was expecting but it was still very good.  My wife chose the frittata style eggs and didn't enjoy it much. She said that the eggs, with the melted cheddar cheese and the pork sausage, had the texture of shoes. Well, that was a bummer. But the biscuit was good with their table jam on it.  But with that said, we both thoroughly enjoyed the sweet potato hash.  So go with the sweet potato hash and you should be okay!",

The place wasn't too busy, seemed like a typical Wednesday crowd, however you could see how some people were anxiously awaiting their food.  Our 2 year old was asleep, so we figured we would give it a shot. Sadly the experience wasn't any different for us.   Server told us to seat ourselves and then they forgot about us. Got our own menu from the bar, so took about 15-20 min to put our order in and get waters.   We waited over an hour for a pancake, a cup of fruit, & a salad. We tried to cancel our order after my nephew woke up fussy and we had already been waiting for a good 50 min. As we made this request one server whispered to another and then another server came rushing out of the back with our food.   We heard multiple excuses about how some orders got mixed up and as well as the ticket printer wasn't working; however we weren't told any of this until after we requested for our order to be cancelled.   Future reference to this situation: Communicate this to your customer so they know what to expect and can level with you.   The boxed up food to-go got the stars in this review, the service definitely did not.",

We sat down right away, and the service was fantastic. Coffee brewed in house. Nothing too special, but something to wake up the taste buds in the morning!   The breakfast dish of my likening was Booker T's East Side Hasher. If you don't like cheese, this is not the dish for you. Make sure to opt for the pork sausage, it's a local vendor! This comes with a side of toast or TLC biscuit and you need to get the biscuit. Whatever you opt for, make sure to try to homemade jam, it is absolutely incredible.   This just might be the tex-mex breakfast place I was looking for right here in my neighborhood!",

Something about the combination of crisp spring greens, warm and flavorful potatoes, the savory marinated tofu, and the tangy vinaigrette makes me come back every time. It's filling and flavorful without being too heavy. It gives me an energy boost, doesn't leave me feeling like I need a nap like so many brunch options. My husband loves the Booker T, which is heavier and more indulgent. And the biscuits and jams, mmmmmm. Great service, too!",

After years of spending many weekend breakfasts at Zada Jane's, we've finally had our last.   We arrived as one of the first tables on a Sunday. No wait for either inside of outside. It was still pretty quiet. Our family of four waited 45 minutes for our breakfast after ordering, while tables continued to be served who arrived and ordered after us. Once our food came I quickly discovered that my omelette was filled with goat cheese and asked them to remake it as I had ordered it - no goat cheese. Two different people asked me to remind them what I had ordered. 15-20 minutes later my family had finished eating when my food was brought. We asked to have it packed to go so they simply brought me a box. No real apology. No offers to make it right. No helping me pack up my breakfast.   I wish this was a one off but service has continued to steadily go down over the years and the neighborhood location can't justify such bad service.",

My wife ordered a more substantial meal, and hers came out burnt badly and look disgusting on the plate.

Even at lunch in the middle of the week when the restaurant was only half full. But last night took the cake.  We came in and since there were no free tables, we sat at the bar. We ordered some sodas and then our food pretty quickly. I had to be at work an hour and a half later so we definitely thought there'd be plenty of time but after 45 minutes without getting our food, I was getting very anxious. I finally asked a waitress to check on our food and I told her I had to leave soon to go to work. She kind of dilly-dallied into the kitchen and came back out and told us that our waitress would let us know what was going on.  Our waitress came back out, did some stuff on the computer, cleaned some plates, and all while I was just staring at her waiting for an answer. Finally she comes to me and says that the kitchen lost a few tickets or I guess they thought our food had already come out or some lame answer. I told her to forget it because I just couldn't wait any longer. She said \"well don't worry about the drinks.\" Thanks...if I had known I was going to get free drinks instead of dinner, I would've ordered a bottle of wine. I would've really appreciated a gift certificate or something.  Now, I have worked in many restaurants and I understand things happen. But she really should've noticed after 20 minutes that we have not had our food and checked on it herself. The fact that I had to ask and then there was no sense of urgency or sincere remorse really irked me. I ended up going down to Fuel for a quick slice of pizza and inhaled it before work. Not what I had looked forward to doing right before 6 hours on my feet serving people drinks.  I think I'll just be officially done with this place. Unfortunately.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to go here for a while but when I'm usually in the area, Zada Jane's is an afterthought. Until I went yesterday, I didn't even know exactly what they served.  We finally go the opportunity to go yesterday. The first thing I noticed was that the decor felt a little forced. Kinda like it was trying a little too hard to fit in with the neighborhood. Secondly, this seems to be the hipster epicenter of Charlotte. I felt like running out and buying a scarf doing my hair in that flippy thing way the vocalist for that one band does on his pictures. But I digress.   The menu, at first glance, looked impressive but we eventually settled on a bowl of cauliflower and artichoke hearts soup. The soup was great and it came with some old school Wheat Thins Lance Crackers. The soup was amazing, creamy and hearty. But if I were to do a blind taste test, I would have said it was broccoli soup.  The Becky ordered the Green Mindmelt Panini which had roasted portabellas, zucchini, squash, tomatoes, spinach and mozzarella with a side of the sweet potato home fries. Although it was very messy to eat, it was delicious! All the ingredients went well and were nicely roasted.  I, on the other hand, can't say the same for my Turkey sammich. My sammich came with turkey, guacamole and sprouts. It was the most bland thing I've had in a while. The bread was so dry and stale I could't really down the bites I took. I didn't finish it, took it home, tried a bite a little later, and had to dump it in the trash.  Now, it's not that bad, my sammich was off but everything else was really good. My gripe was with our server. She started off great. She was polite and friendly and smiled a lot, etc. It was nice of her to remember to bring us two spoons for our shared bowl of soup. But towards the end, she just sorta disappeared.  The place isn't even that big for someone to disappear for what seemed like 10 minutes at a time. We wanted to get our check, we had to sit and wait for a long time just to see her and flag her down. Finally brought us our check, took me 10 seconds to take my card out and put on the tray but she was gone by then. We did not see her for another ten minutes. We just sat there with our check, ready to leave, but couldn't. At one point I wanted to just get up and find her. Eventually she came back around and she checked us out. Very traumatic event... haha.  I didn't care much for this place. It's not bad, just not my thing I guess.",

    "text": "This used to be my favorite brunch spot in Charlotte, but I'll never go there again after Sunday. We knew mother's day meant it would be packed, but we were told a 35 minute wait which seemed reasonable. We noticed open seats at the bar but were told those seats were treated like tables and were off limits.  After 50 minutes there were still 4 people ahead of us on the list. Bar seats remained open, but hey, those are off limits. We pointed out that we had been waiting over an hour. 2 minutes after we were told this, another couple came in to ask how long the wait was. The hostess told them 35 minutes. What?!?  We finally asked about the (still) empty bar seats. This time we were told sure you can sit there right now! Had we NOT done this, I'm  certain we would have waited another half hour. We ordered at the same time as 2 other parties. Now crowning 2 hours there with no food, we watched one of those couples order, eat, pay their check. And the other group had ordered, ate, ordered more, ate........and we still didn't have food. The food finally came after asking twice about it. If I wasn't dying of starvation, I would have told them to keep it.  And not one person ever apologized. I don't have a problem with an hour or so wait if I'm told an hour. Another diner said she waited 2 hours because she had a common last name and the hostess gave the table that was intended for them to another party. party. I suggest Zada Jane's get a wait system a little more sophisticated than writing names on the back of an envelope.  I'm really sad because I used to looooove this place. But they've lost me as a customer.",

Zada's is definitely a staple that deserves to be on everyone's breakfast shortlist. Find it odd that I've yet to write a review until now.   Here's the gist: If it's cold or raining, sit inside. If the wait is monstrous, I typically won't stick it out. If it's sunny outside, do yourself a favor and grab table on the patio. If the wait it horrifically long in general and you have to have your Bunny Rancheros fix, take a spot in line and play a few games of shuffleboard.   Pretty sure I get the Bunny Rancheros every time with wheat toast slathered with apple butter. The local chorizo isn't half bad either.   I'm a fan, it's great in a pinch, I like to pretend I'm good at shuffleboard, and I'd definitely take firstmeal at Zada's happen in a pinch. Winner.",

I had the french toast, and it was good. My bread was burned. I was close to sending it back, but it didn't have a charred taste, it was just black. Yum. The chorizo sausage is where it's at here. You'll be burping it up all day.   The best part about this place is eating outside under the umbrellas on a nice day with your dog next to you (if you have one).  We should have gone to Vivace like we usually do. Much much better!  Not recommended here at Zada Jane's.",

Ever since I moved to Charlotte, several people had told me you have to go to Zada Jane's in Plaza Midwood. It must be more for the name than anything else. We ended up leaving and not even eating there. After waiting 30 minutes for our food (two appetizers and a salad), it was not even worth the wait. We sent the food back and went elsewhere. The salad was wrong and the appetizers were nasty. I don't know what has happened to Zada Jane's, but it looks like there are more bad reviews on here than ever before. Hopefully it will change for the better, but I will certainly not be back to find out.",

I found a nice little outdoor table and read my book while awaiting the waitress. After 30 minutes passed and no one had even given me a menu or asked was I thirsty I decided to go in. The waitress got an attitude with me and seemed very irritated when I asked was there a waitress available to take my order. She sends me back outside and another waitress comes and takes my order I then had to wait another 30-45 minutes to get my food which was only a small grilled shrimp Caesar salad. Which looked pretty good by the way which I never got to taste because as soon as I went in for a bite guess what I find?!?!! Nasty hair in my food!!! Can you say disgusted! Then went I went and showed the waitress she had the audacity to get mad at me like it was my fault!!! I have blonde hair the hair in my  salad was long and brunette!! How about wearing a hair net next time?!?! I'll never go back",

It didn't take too long to be seated, and both hostess and waitress were fresh faced and cheerful.  The decor features bold, brash colors that one may have not thought to put together, but they work.  Brett got a large serving of blueberry pancakes, and an order of hash browns topped with egg and cheese.  So much food that he ended up taking some home, along with some from my plate.  I had The Belvedere, an omelet featuring mushrooms, onions and peppers, along with yummy surprise bites of goat cheese.  The plate also had hash browns, which were really roasted potatoes, perfectly cooked with nicely browned edges.  A biscuit arrived as well, which was a real treat for me since I consume little gluten.  The buttermilk flavor of the biscuit shone through.  I ate the whole biscuit with butter (bad girl)!  Our waitress was on the ready to fill our coffee cups, and the whole experience was completely happy. Our cat, Newman, approves of this review.  He lay on my lap and was in direct line of my hand brushing across his head as I typed.  Purrrrrrr!!!",

    "text": "So I am a little shocked that it has taken me this long to write a review for Zada's but better late than never right?  I live probably a good 1.2 miles from this trendy establishment and thank God for it.  I have tried a few breakfast/brunch joints in Charlotte and I have to say that I appreciate the lack of pretensiousness that Zada's offers amongst the slew of other \"brunch\" destinations.    My current favorite is the Blazing Saddles Omelet...a juevo caccoon of delicious chipotle chicken, black beans and jalepenos mixed with mouth watering pico de gallo and topped with a generous dollop of sour cream.  A few other favorites are the Bunny Rancheros (similar tex mex flavor sans omelet style), the Booker T's East Side Hasher and the Belveder (for a healthier option).  I ALWAYS opt for the roasted sweet potatoes and  homemade biscuits (...when in the South)  and slather a generous helping of their homemade berry jam a top for a healthy touch, HA!    For the java fans, you can feed your caffeine fix while you wait (probably a while... at least on Sunday) for a table.  There are plenty of quirky nostalgic mugs to pick from and a piping pot of coffee available while you wait... either outside--enjoying the sunshine, shuffleboard and cornhole games, and Central Ave traffic or eyeing the plates of patrons inside, chatting with the sweet, curly haired bartender as she concocts a delicious bloody mary, or trying to decipher the indoor wall art... this can take a while.    And one more thing worthy of note, this breakfast bistro is pet friendly... outdoors that is.  Don't be surprised if your waitress brings over a bowl of water and a treat for your furry friend as you dine in the daylight.    Delicious breakfast food, coffee for days, outside games, and the pooches approve?!  Next time you ponder, where to go for brunch... Zada's should clearly be your answer.",

A homey, ecletic interior spills out onto a room patio for outdoor dining, and inbetween are servers who you can tell really enjoy their job. And not just serving, but working at Zada Jane's.  I have found this to be a great go-to spot not just for brunch/lunch but also for meetings. The 10am/11am sweet spot that's after breakfast but before the lunch rush M-F is a great time to stop in and having coffee with a friend, talk business over tea or read a book with some free range scrambled eggs.  Highly recommended are the bunny rancheros (Elizabeth's review is worth checking out for the full low-down on those bad boys!), ala carte eggs and toasts (cheap, yummy breakfast!), and the salads with tofu options.  A great addition to the 'Wood - swing by and see what we're loving!",

After finishing our food, we continued to talk and drink our coffees. Our waiter was very much present while we were eating but disappeared after dropping off the check (and never filled up waters). After 10-15 minutes after getting the checks (still drinking coffee) we were asked to leave because they were on a wait and needed the table. I found this incredibly rude. Furthermore, it wasn't even our waiter that told us, he told someone else and had them come ask us to leave. This left a sour taste in my mouth for sure. I won't be going back to Zada Janes for a long time. Plenty of other brunch places that appreciate their patrons - and are respectful. As far as the food, my eggs were over cooked and the fruit was just ok (soggy melon, strawberries and grapes with tops/stems still in place). A disappointing experience. Will visit Jack Beagles, Bistro La Bon or other local spots before going back to ZJs.",

    "text": "Zada Jane's was recommended to me by a Charolotte native that now resides in Seattle. So, when I flew to Charolotte to visit my bestie, I made sure I had breakfast here at some point during my trip.   As I sat outside of Zada Jane's in my rented Kia Soul, I anxiously awaited their doors to open. When I saw two gentlemen walk up to the entrance I shortly followed.   I was greeted and seated by a nice lady to which I immediately asked for a bloody mary because when you're on vacation, you get booze for breakfast of course! The bloody mary was nice and not too spicy. It complimented my Booker T's East Side Hasher very well. The Hasher came with a bed of sweet potato home fries (which were to die for), two \"happy eggs\" fritatta style (according to the menu) and your choice of Grateful Growers pork sausage (where all their pork products come from), turkey sausage or soysage (I chose the Grateful Growers pork sausage), then covered in heavenly melted cheddar cheese and sprinkles of green onions on top. You can then choose their TLC biscuit or toast (Duh, I ordered the TLC biscuit). Just writing this review tempts me to book a flight to NC to see my bestie again.... and Zada Jane, my new BFF.   My bloody mary was a damn good bloody mary. No frou frou bull crap in the garnish, just the essentials. It was a get-to-the-point bloody marry that went so sinfully well with my breakfast that I had \"wished my bestie had called in to work that day and joined me for breakfast\" good. The sausage from GG was just perfectly seasoned and complimented the sweet potatoes very well. The cheddar, well we are in the south y'all, was rich, very very rich and extra melty (grins from ear to ear aaaaaand now drooling). The happy eggs, let me just grab the definition off the menu, free range eggs. You can rest assured folks that your eggs were happy prior to them becoming your breakfast/lunch. No wonder I was pretty damn happy after I ate my breakfast! Also, even though the morning sky had overcast, my breakfast and my rental car, being a super bright yellow Kia Soul, brightened up my day.   Oh Zada Jane, why must you be on the other side of the country! I cannot wait until I make the trek out there just to come back and try your other offerings. As I sit here so early in the morning typing out this review and my stomach is so empty and hungry craving one of your sweet sweet breakfasts..... ok... on to <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsouthwest.com&s=0d19de58e1fa6a2608c9038109d88cfe3ed7de68397d15b8164244e8f715ea53\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">southwest.com</a> pronto!",

This place isn't too large, and it gets crowded ... so go early if you don't feel like waiting.   Bunny Rancheros --- JUST DO IT. I recommend it with the chorizo sausage to make it flavorful and a little more 'caliente'. It comes out looking a hot mess ... but it's a pile of awesomeness. It's a huge portion too, so come hungry or ready to share.   Druther's Clucker --- May be my new favorite chicken sandwich. The foccacia bread was perfect way to hold all the delicious ingredients together. The sun-dried tomato mayo spread complimented the sandwich perfectly. For the side, you cannot go wrong with the sweet potato browns.",

While Charlotte has a ton to offer, not much can measure up to the phenomenal selection available in Asheville.  Zada Janes made me forget I was in Charlotte.    Between my wife and I we had Bacon/Egg/Cheese biscuit, the Blazing Saddles Breakfast Burrito, and Sweet Potato/Chocolate Chip pancakes.  All were delicious and reminded us how much we love the South.  I really doubt there is anything on the menu that isn't good.  We also had the Chai Latte which was brewed perfectly.  When we arrived the place was packed.  When we put our name in we were told it would be 40 minutes before a table would be available.  I don't think we even had to wait 15 minutes.  The staff was efficient, courteous, and attentive - everything you want when you go out to eat.",

A party of three was walking into the restaurant as I got out of my car. When I got inside, I saw that they had been waiting for a minute or two so I decided to use the restroom. After coming out, I saw the party leave. I waited around for a few more minutes before grabbing a menu and heading to a table outside.   About 25-30 minutes passed before another table was seated outside, and a server appeared to take their drink order. I looked up in an attempt to grab the server's attention, but she went a roundabout way to get back inside without passing my table despite the fact that it was right next to the other party. I dismissed the incident and assumed she was busy. This happened yet again the next time she came outside so I finally got up and left. I was at Zada's for over 45 minutes without ever being acknowledged.   To say the service was poor is an understatement. There was no service.",

Parking can be tricky, so I parked across the street in the lot, but sometimes it's full and I wouldn't have known where else to park in that case. One friend had an omelette and salad and enjoyed it, while the rest of my friends had dessert. Carrot cake and pistachio bread pudding was what they had the day we came. I tried the carrot cake and it was my favorite carrot cake I've had. I do not like carrot cake because it's always either too dry or too sweet, but this one was really good and didn't have big chunks of walnuts like others I've tried. It tasted so fresh and was the perfect constancy. Their coffee and latte's are also really good, served in a cute home-y mug. I like the outdoor patio and the neighborhood vibe.",

I am stopping mid-meal to do this because I want them to get the credit they deserve.  Let's start with the ambiance:  this place is so laid back and welcoming. The patio welcomes dogs, kids, and a game of corn hole or shuffle board. The inside of the place is so colorful. Even with the 20 minute wait, my eyes had plenty to soak up. Even though there are a lot of colors, it's not overbearing. It's light and bright.  The staff is lovely and our server really understands her menu and how to describe their dishes. We chose our meal off her recommendations.  I'm going to be honest, the place could be awful looking and the staff could be crap, but I would come back for the food in a heartbeat. Today's special is a crab cake with tomato and aioli on a biscuit with a side of habanero grits. AMAZING. My guy got the Bunny Rancheros with chipotle chicken. I usually can't stand Tex-mex brunch items, but this changed my mind. The guacamole from scratch, the chicken, even the sour cream (I really can't stand the stuff) was perfectly balanced. I say they should have the guac as a side dish with some chips, so good.  This was the perfect start to our visit to Charlotte. We weren't even planning on going anywhere we couldn't take a short walk to because we're staying the heart of the city, but it was completely worth the short drive. If you live her or are just visiting, don't miss this place.",

The variety in the roasted vegetables was superior! (Note: The black eye pea salad and roasted sweet potatoes are not vegan).  The service leaves a bit to be desired. Seemed as though one person was trying to do it all. Maybe hire an extra server for the place. The knowledge of the one guy doing it all was...okay at best. If asked a question he was always unsure but would happily go and check.   The atmosphere was delightful! Cute decor and fun music. Parking is limited and challenging though.   They have wine, beer, and coffee with many Torino syrups too. Their vegetarian and vegan items are fairly well marked and they even have gluten-free options. I would come again!",

To preface with a few quick points-- - I lived in NYC for 5 years, so I'm very familiar and comfortable with a long wait - I used to be a server and understand the circumstances outside their control - I still think the food is fantastic (top quality, great preparation, inventive recipes)  However on my last visit, the service was shockingly consistent in it's rudeness, ineptness and mistakes. There were a few key small gestures or things said by the wait staff which could have greatly improved the experience, but this didn't seem to be in the interest of the waitress. I completely understand the situation at a busy, popular place and I usually sympathize with waiters, but there was no benefit of the doubt to give this time so unfortunately I won't be back.",

I like zucchini, but I've never even conceived that anyone would put it in nachos. I like spicy so I added some Sriracha sauce to mines. The nachos were delicious. I will definitely be back for some more. We ate outside on the patio since it was a nice day out. My guy had the Portobello mushroom sandwich with the garlic potatoes on the side. He said it was delicious.  The wait service could have been better, hence the three stars. She seated us and said she would be back with the menus.

Seriously, my friend was timing, bc she warned us that they are always slow  30 minutes from sit down to order taking.  Food took another half-hour to get out.  Food was tepid at best.  Then came the paying debacle.  It took 50 minutes and that is no exaggeration from when we asked for the check for us to leave.  This is after they ran our bills wrong, were simply befuddled on how to do a void.     I was warned they were always pretty slow, but this was a record for me.    I would also say that none of the other servers were too interested in help this poor thing and they were equally moving slower than molasses, not thinking of the greater good of the restaurants image.    My friend left nothing.   I'm the patron saint of all servers after doing it for years, but this is the 1st time I've never left at least 10%.  $1 was all I could muster up on a $37 ticket for 2 people.    I guess the manager came out after all of this mess to see what she could do to have us come back.  My friend asked for her money back since she did ask, and she said she couldn't do that but offer a gift certificate.  That wouldn't work since she won't be back.  I won't be back, which is a shame, bc I like the place and my sandwich was good.  BTW they charged $4 for a glass of chocolate milk for a kid...WTF?",

Absolutely 5-star delicious. HOWEVER, we sat in the corner, so we could people watch and saw some kitchen-nightmares behavior from the staff.   Customers would walk in, and stand by the door waiting to be acknowledged and seated. The staff would walk around them and not make eye contact. Finally, someone behind the bar area would call out that they could sit where they wanted. When we first walked in, we experienced this too. but the restuarant wasn't as busy then, so they acknowledged us faster. This could be solved with a simple sigh by the door that says \"Please seat yourself\".   Other than that, we really enjoyed Zada Jane's. We'll come back the next time we are in town... at least now we know to seat ourselves!",

If you're going here for one meal and one meal only, make it breakfast. Especially if the weather's nice and you can sit on the patio. If it's a weekend, expect a crowd and perhaps a wait, but you can always play shuffleboard until you get a table.   Sure the huevos rancheros aren't entirely authentic, but they're still great. I like the sweet potato hashbrowns, french toast and pancakes. The chorizo and sausage they use is delicious (from Grateful Growers, I believe).   Dinner entrees are pricey, unfortunately. As others have mentioned, salads and sandwiches are more budget friendly. Though, during restaurant week a couple of years ago my then-boyfriend and I had an amazing dinner. Perfectly executed pork belly and ahi tuna dishes. But, as you can tell, I usually stick to breakfast or brunch. :)",

A friend specifically ordered gluten free pancakes. Having a gluten allergy this seemed to be a no brainer. Half way through the meal the server let's us know that the pancakes are not the gluten free ones and asks. \"Do you still want them?\" Then proceeds to tell us that someone else can have the rest of her half eaten ones since she wasn't going to finish them. WHAT?! So after a trip to CVS and $20 in medication we will not be returning again. Sorry Zada. This failure can't be recovered from.",

We got there at 9:30 on a Sunday and literally by seconds beat the massive crowd.   We ended up getting a table after about 10 minutes, but the food took about 40, which was definitely disappointing. However, I really loved the funky atmosphere with different mugs and knick knacks--see if you can find the spaceman next time you are there!   The food was really great as well. Since I live in Boston now, I was craving a biscuit and it was super delicious! I took bites of most of the food people at my table was eating. I enjoyed my omelet, the pancakes, the potatoes and of course that biscuit.   If you plan on going on a Sunday, I would get there early, or come when you aren't so hungry. Waiting with all that yummy food around is torture!",

I'm from Atlanta and, at first, I thought this place was a knockoff of the Flying Bisquit (which, by the way, I understand has opened one in Charlotte). The same eclectic decor and a very similar menu.  Food is quite good. However, the service was atrocious. I asked the owner if the slow service was due to lack of help on a holiday weekend and she said it was.   Like an idiot (mostly because my wife insisted) I gave it another try the next day. Slightly better service but pretty much the same results. The best part was that they have a patio area where we can take the dog while we eat. Lots of people, many with dogs.  The food is good enough to give it one more try but not on a holiday weekend.",

    "text": "There are many things I like about Zada Jane's - in concept.  They're in my neighborhood, which means when I wake up craving brunch I don't have to drive across town.  They have a variety of vegetarian options (I'm not a vegetarian, but I'm not a heavy meat-eater either).  They use local sources for their food.  They have a funky and eclectic decor.  They have free coffee while you wait for a table.    Unfortunately, whenever I go there, the reality tends to play out like this: I wake up craving brunch, but when I get there the line out the door.  It's so chaotic inside that it takes me ten minutes to find someone to put my name on the list.  I fight my way through the throng to get some coffee only to discover there aren't any coffee cups.  Then I wait so long for a table that by the time I sit down I could have driven across town, eaten somewhere else and gotten back home again.  And that's not even counting how long it takes for my food to come out.  When my food finally does arrive, every other time it's overcooked or undercooked, or it tastes like someone spilled a whole salt shaker in my hash browns.  But I eat it anyway, because there is no way I'm sending anything back and waiting for it to be cooked again.  And then I wait....and wait...AND WAIT for my server to remember I'm there and bring me my check.  By the time I leave I've lost three hours, and I'm not even fat and happy.  (Just fat.)  There's no denying this is a popular place, but sometimes I wonder if other people are having a different experience from mine, or if they've decided they love it so they put up with the slow service and the inconsistencies with the quality of the food.    Whatever the case may be, my husband and I have decided not to waste our time on Zada Jane's anymore.  We've had too many broken-hearted brunches to let ourselves be hurt again.  We've found a new brunch spot - Foskoskies on Shamrock.  We have yet to be disappointed there.",

It seems to me that Zada Jane's head has gotten a little big as of late.  The waitstaff is now so elite they could care less to actually serve their customers.  One time, the hostess made us sit outside when it was sprinkling.  She didn't even ask if we wanted to sit inside.  And we were the only people out there.  Our waitress moved us inside the first chance she had.     Over a year ago, I took my dog and ate outside.  The waitress brought me a cup of water for her without me asking.  Wow, have things changed.    This past weekend, a friend and I went for breakfast around 1pm.  We didn't have to wait because we ended up sitting at the bar.  After being seated, we weren't even acknowledged for over 10 minutes but the guy behind the counter was busy serving everyone around us.  When he finally took our drink orders, I was ready to place my order, but he didn't stick around long enough to ask.  It took another 10 minutes to get our drinks.  When we finally did order, he asked for our order and continued talking to other people (I wasn't even sure if he heard me).  After another 20 minutes, our food came out.  Redemption.  The food is delicious (and healthy).  I had the Blazing Saddles - it's an omelet with black beans and chicken topped with sour cream.    Run Down:  If your willing to put up with the snobby, elitist, slow waitstaff to get some delicious breakfast food and you have a couple hours to loaf around, this is a great place for breakfast.  I'm not saying the service is ALWAYS this bad, but I wouldn't risk it.  If you are hungry and you see people waiting to be seated, turn around and go to the Dish or Penguin.  Their service is always fast and friendly.  If you still want breakfast, try the Original Pancake House.",

The Huevos Rancheros are the best I've ever had, although I don't eat that every day for breakfast like I do the coffee, so I may be out of line.

Zada Janes is totally eclectic; both their interior and their menu reflect the quirky attitude.  I love it.  We've only been twice on two consecutive visits to Charlotte, and it's fast becoming a must-stop place. Everything I've tasted, from their soups to hummus to salads, has been delicious.",

Everything I've tried has been delicious. I've never once been disappointed. The coffee is very yummy as well. Service is a bit slow but I'm assuming it's because they are always packed. So just be a bit patient. Definitely a unique menu, not food you will see at a typical breakfast place. All in all, love the food and the cute homey feel of the restaurant.",

The ingredients made it look like a promising Tex-Mex dish--eggs, house potatoes,  black beans, your choice of meat, guacamole, tortillas, etc.--but the dish was lacking the traditional Mexican flavors that one would expect. My rating is also influenced by the fact that my food was served room-temperature to me, which makes eggs over easy not the most appetizing.  I also had a side of French toast accompanied by a delicious butter. I was debating between the Bunny Rancheros and the Amaretto French Toast and the French Toast is likely the better choice.",

I believe it is good food but honestly having to wait that long it is not worth five stars for me. I think their kitchen is tiny or something because it just takes awhile. If you are having fun and not worried about time this is the perfect place for you . I would recommend going to Dish for faster and better food around the corner. The only problem is the hours are little different than here. Zada Janes you either love or not so much.   I would recommend it to people who haven't been ,but I am not like I need to go there right now kind of place. I guess it is unfair since I expect to go to a place where people are licking there fingers yelling 'girl I told you so'. Nevertheless , go and try it and let me know what you think about it too. I hope your experience is a great one!",

I left her a note to \"smile & be less rude\" and she sent her shoulder rubbing friend outside to \"chase\" down the person (me) who left the \"rude\" note.

It was about a 45 minute wait but we were able to get some coffee at the bar. We asked for two lattes from the bartenders and were greeted with an annoyance at our orders. I'm sure she was busy but definitely didn't feel like she wanted to take our coffee orders before we sat down for brunch. However, I will say, every other person we encountered was super friendly and helpful and made us feel at home. We waited out on their patio since they have a pretty small inside restaurant. It was a bit chilly and they could benefit from some outside heaters to make the wait easier but worked out either way. I ordered the bunny rancheros which were phenomenal. They come with a really delicious queso smothered on top and the soy sausage was well seasoned and tasty. Was a great stop in for brunch. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review was the strange reception at the bar area. Would definitely come again!",

We said yes not knowing how much worse our experience was about to get. We waited over an hour for our food after ordering, and when we asked our waitress for updates she said pretentious things such as \"this is zada janes\" and \"it's busy\". She was completely incompetent and told us that it would be 5 minutes over and over and over with no food being delivered. When we were at the point of leaving, they started bringing out our food in stages, meaning it just got cold while we waited for everyone else's. When we asked other staff about the food status, we were told that they \"weren't prepared\" - not prepared for New Year's Day in Charlotte when all banks are closed after this restaurant has been open for 15 years? Makes perfect sense (not). We were not offered any kind of free food or compensation for our time, hunger and the rudeness we were treated with by all staff. DO NOT go here if you want to eat.

However the place is pretty nice, love the location although some times it requires street parking or creative parking.  And the serving is unfailingly good.  But I go there to eat and they just don't get it right.   The time before last I ordered the bunny rancheros.  I chose the sausage and should have chosen something else, it was just meaty and salty but the rest seem decent when she came to ask how were we finding the meal.  The first two bites, tasty, but then the hash brown/home fries were actually hard, as in not cooked long enough.  And the black beans were really dry, must have been in a pot for a long time.  By then I had eaten one forth of the meal so decided to concentrate on the good stuff.  It did have good avocado and the eggs were cooked correctly, over easy, although one came already broken, but you couldn't  tell because it had broken underneath. One of my friends had nachos and those were good.  I've been there just for coffee, and that is very good, strong and tasty.  For $2.75 you get refills.  So the last time I decided to play it safe and order the nachos to share with a friend as well as a salad.  The result is I will not be back there for food.  The chips were old, not super old, the kind of old you think they don't taste good but since they are a little wet you don't know for sure.  But when I asked my girlfriend she agreed.  I had ordered it with chicken.  I think Moe's gives you far more chicken, we couldn't find it.  It came with a scoop of guacamole that had that yellowish color like when it has been sitting around.  There was little cheese in it.  And while it was supposed to come with veggies we did find some zucchini but it was layered with a bunch of lettuce, including the very hard bottom of a lettuce.  Definitely subpar but with the chips being old not worthy at all.  The salad was ok.    They want to go for the natural organic vibe and they fall way short in their food.  I would recommend it for coffee only.",

    "text": "Finally came to Zada Jane's for dinner, as opposed to my normal obsession with their breakfast food. My fiancee and I have used 2 Groupons in the past year here, woohoo for coupons!   My first dinner venture was the Roasted Wild Mushroom Ravioli. I would probably give it 3.5/5 starts. Really good and tasty, but nothing special.  My second dinner visit I chose the The No-Da Salad. This will be what I order like, basically every time in the future. As a vegetarian it's hard to find a hearty salad with lots of protein and this salad goes above and beyond. The base is a spring mix with baked marinated tofu, tomatoes, hard boiled egg, artichoke hearts, avocado, roasted corn, white cheddar cheese, sunflower seeds, sprouts. Ahhh! Amazing!   My fiancee ordered the Ashley Farms Free Range Chicken entree. Other than his usual love, the Belvedere, this is currently his favorite thing he's ordered. It comes with a side of smashed potatoes and green bean casserole.   Oh, I almost forgot, on our last visit we ordered the Nachos as an appetizer. These were a little different than your normal nachos because they're served in a bowl, rather than a plate. Of course I love that they're vegetarian. The queso is what's up though. Mmmm! These black tortilla chips are also piled with grilled veggies, black beans, guacamole, romaine lettuce, sour cream, corn, and salsa. Will definitely order again.  The service this last time was great. The owner even came over and chit chatted a while. This is not always the case. I'd say, 1/3 of the time we get unlucky and get bad service. But luckily this isn't always and the food makes me forgive.",

The sweet potato hash-browns were covered by frittata style eggs made with my choice of protein -  I opted for turkey sausage.  This was covered by melted cheddar.  I decided to get a biscuit and it reminded me of the ones my grandmother used to make.  My server also brought apple butter and berry jam.    The food was good and portion sizes were quite large - I ate half & had enough to take home for another meal. Price was very reasonable at $8.95.  My server was very friendly and kept on top of things. Based on this visit, I would certainly go back.",

    "text": "Once upon a time, Zada Jane's was a highly sought after brunch spot with long waits and iconic breakfast plates. Unfortunately, Zada Jane's is now nothing more than a has-been diner with exceptionally poor customer service and a kitchen staff that must be deaf, blind and dumb.   After a handful disappointing visits, I figured I'd give Zada Jane's a final chance and called in an order on Memorial Day weekend- I mean, how badly could you mess up a takeout order?   When I arrived at the restaurant, I could see my take out boxes sitting on the bar counter with a bill that matched my estimated total all ready to go. After standing by the unattended bar awkwardly for close to ten minutes, I flagged down a waitress that happened to look up from a personal conversation in which she and several other employee's attention seemed to be totally consumed. I let her know that I was here to pick up the order that was sitting in front of me at the bar. She very rudely challenged my assumption that the boxes that matched my order and cost were, in fact, for me, and told me to wait while she grabbed someone that could help me. Perhaps I'm in the wrong here, but I don't find it normal or appropriate to be the subject of such hostility when I was certainly not the one that left my manners at home.  So, I waited. And waited.  Followed by more waiting.  Finally, someone competent appeared and completed this drawn out transaction. Finally, I did not have to beg the staff to acknowledge my presence. Finally, I did not have to argue with the staff to allow me to pay for my food. Finally, I could leave and be on my way.   When I arrived home, I opened the boxes to find that my order was wrong. I paid an extra $2.00 to include an additional meat option in my Booker T. Only one type of meat was to be found. In the other Booker T, the dish was made with an entirely different meat than I had requested. Breakfast cuisine isn't hard. In fact, I'm not so sure as to why I opted to pay $20.00 for something that would cost $7.00 to make at home.   In all, if the next time I find myself craving an unhealthy egg dish served by a grumpy woman with messy hair and no bra, I will stay at home and ask my girlfriend to cook. At least the food will taste better.",

As you might be able to tell I'm more than a bit perturbed by my latest encounter with Zada Jane's.  I went here an hour ago looking to grab a quick bite before getting ready for the Super Bowl later today.  This is now the fourth time I have been to Zada Jane's, and I have only been able to eat there once.  No jokes, No exaggeration.    As I was saying I went here on Sunday morning, arrived by 9:10am.  Took 5min to drive around desperately searching for a space.  After finally finding a tight spot, which may or may not have been a real space, my friend and I went in and were told the wait would be 10-15min, we waited 40min.  No one looked close to finishing their meals.   One party had left since we had been waiting.  We had no choice but to bail before we were committed to waiting another 45min to be seated and for our food to arrive.    Zada' Janes may very well have the best damn tasting breakfast in all of Charlotte - maybe their eggs are sent down from heavenly chickens laying only the freshest, locally grown, free range eggs in clouds instead of nests, and their pork cut from only the biggest, muddiest, hogs, I don't know.  But I do know, It's IMPOSSIBLE to get a table and eat a meal on the weekends in any sort of timely fashion at Zada Jane's.  If you look for long lines, and crowded restaurants as any indication of good food, then you'll think Zada Janes is the greatest food known to man.  I, on the other hand, like to eat a good meal, AND be able to get in and out in a timely fashion.  It'll be a long time before I go to Zada Jane' to eat...I mean WAIT.",

Zara Jane's has apparently successfully completed a nationwide search to find a staff who cares the least about customer service. Don't expect refills on your drinks and expect to wait over an hour for your food once you order. If you have the gall to stand up and go ask what's going on, no one ever has any clue. The kitchen is SO SLOW and the servers just DGAF.   The food itself is okay, it's a little overpriced but not by that much.   In summary, if you want an okay, overpriced omelette, and you have three hours of time to dedicate, this might be the place for you. Just don't go hungry.

    "text": "I have eaten at Zada Jane's twice in the past couple of weeks but sadly, enjoyed my first visit more than my second.   On my first visit, I ordered the Bunny Rancheros and would have eaten the entire plate but did not for fear that my stomach would explode. It was absolutely delicious. Every element of the dish was perfect and would keep me coming back indefinitely.   As I am contemplating my second trip, I am puzzled as to why I chose to deviate from the Bunny Rancheros but I suppose it makes me a more educated reviewer of the restuarant. I decided to order the East Side Hasher while my boyfriend ordered the Rancheros at my urging. The Hasher was O.K. but really nothing special. The eggs were a bit overcooked and it was lacking seasoning but the sausage was in huge, delicious chunks and the sweet potatoes were amazing.   Overall, I really like the atmosphere and the food at Zada Janes. There are vegan and vegetarian options all over the menu and they even have a full bar! The menu is very small but breakfast is served all day so it gives you a few more options than the lunch or dinner fare. The service is good, the restaurant is cute, and the ingredients are fresh so I will definitely be returning.",

Trick is to come early as you can to avoid a wait and do not park across the street, the barber over there will tow your car, I've had it happen :( but hey there is a sign so it was my own fault! If you do have to wait it is worth it, the food here is awesome! Portions are great prices are fantastic, coffee is delish and you can have as many cups as you want while waiting. The wait staff are sweet and the bar tender is always quick with your bloody Mary :) If you have the chance to sit outside please try in the summer its worth it and you can play some shuffle board too :)",

The menu is your standard diner fare, tweaked a bit. Veggie options abound (I love soysage).   The wait is long during the normal busy times, like Sunday morning or lunch time, and for good reason. The place is freakin' adorable.  One visit, during a particularly busy time, my party was given free Mimosas due to the staff needing to have us move tables. This earned my eternal gratitude.  It also seems to be highly populated by very fashionable and put-together women and hotty men. Always a plus.",

So be it).  When I do visit, I am particularly fond of Z-J's East-West breakfast--which is a tofu curry scramble that doesn't leave you with that gross I-ate-way-too-much-at-brunch feeling.  They also have more decadent offerings, such as their vanilla french toast and very delicious (if not artery-clogging) sweet potato egg hash.    If you ever have a chance, it is particularly nice to stop by during a weekday for brunch (a rare but lovely occurrence for me when it does happen), and I'm hopeful it will be a good place for me to grab a bite with my bambino when that time comes.    Also, they seem to have great hours and appear to be open throughout the day, for which I give them many many high fives.  Service has always been excellent here, too.",

Zada Jane's was exactly that for me on this past rainy Saturday afternoon.  My bf and I stopped in, were promptly seated, and soon I consumed one of those meals that you swear you would eat again three hours later, in its entirety.  The Bunny Racheros....where, oh where, have you been all my life?!?!  I am a huevos rancheros fan anyway and this one takes it to a whole 'nother level, seriously.  Black beans, fried eggs, pepper jack cheese sauce, cilantro crema, turkey sausage....I'm salivating just thinking about it.  It was so, so good!  My boyfriend had a \"vegless avenger\" omelet, which to me is gross due to the excessive amount of meat, but he said it was \"okay\" but he would not order it again.  Take from that what you will.  The biscuits were as promised....fluffy and full of TLC.  I also had an enormous vanilla latte which was damn near perfect.  I can see how this place could get crowded, and no, our service wasn't the fastest, but for a chill Saturday, it was perfect.  I imagine this will be our weekly stop from now on.  As Kevin put it, \"Pancake House who??\"",

    "text": "I've eaten at Zada Jane's twice: once solo, probably close to a year ago, and once with my s.o., just this past weekend.  I spotted Zada Jane's (but didn't eat there) while in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood in Winter 2008 ... oh, and I came down with a vicious case of influenza later that evening! Despite having body and mind ravaged by this particularly agressive strain, I managed to retain enough memory of the exterior of the building to locate it and finally eat there several months later. My experience that initial time wasn't particularly memorable ... the service was fine, though: I had a nice beer, a dish that involved falafel, and ran into a friend of my college roommate from freshman year at Appalachian State. I'm a native of Rutherford County, an hour west of Charlotte, and I've never been a big fan of the city -- I'd much rather drive an hour to Asheville for my cultural activities. However, Plaza Midwood surprised me, and I knew that, when passing through or near Charlotte, I would make it a point to return.  That happened this past weekend. After taking a job-related certification exam in Thomasville, I met up with my girlfriend and her friends for a birthday celebration at Carowinds. My s.o. and I are not big theme-park fans, but we enjoyed ourselves; when the groups separated, though, I knew that she would appreciate deviating from the consumerist excesses that we'd just experienced, so we drove into Charlotte, through the Myers Park area, asked directions to Plaza Midwood from a nice couple out for an evening walk, and made our way to the parking lot behind Zada Jane's.  We arrived sometime after 8, were promptly given our choice of tables on the patio, and were reasonably quickly attended to. Our server was young, bright, friendly, and not at all snobby, and we jumped at the first special she mentioned: an appetizer of heirloom tomatoes topped with fresh mozzarella, mango salsa, basil, and balsamic vineger. We weren't disappointed, as this turned out to be one of the highlights of the meal. My s.o ordered another special -- lentil gespacho, the soup of the day -- and a crabcake sandwich, while I went for breakfast at night: Bunny's Rancheros. I'm not a shellfish enthusiast, but I enjoyed the bite I had of her sandwich; the soup d'jour, on the other hand, was downright remarkable. And I enthusiastically ate bunny's eggs, y'all; it was probably the best dish of huevos rancheros I've ever eaten, and that's saying a lot considering the terrific versions of this available at Sunny Point in West Asheville.  Overall a great experience: friendly, helpful staff; reasonably quick service (in spite of the restaurant's patio filling up QUICKLY  after we arrived); and seriously impressive food quality and complexity of flavors. Would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone.   After leaving this dream meal/date location, we went to the much less enjoyable Rock Bottom to enjoy a quick drink with the birthday crowd at this corporate take on the brewery-restaurant genre. I have to admit: my girlfriend and I looked upon our friends' food (and enjoyment of same) with a mix of pity and contempt following the impressive, local meal we had just consumed.",

Maybe 2 slices of bread instead of one would make it more filling.  Since it was on the menu as a \"meal\", I thought there would be more to it. (but don't get me wrong it was delish)   Like a lot of other people said, the food delivery was very slow, although the drinks came promptly, and the wait staff was very friendly.  At lunch on a Monday holiday, the place was packed.  I also got the sweet tea, which was not \"ordinary\" iced tea.  Some flavoring was different, and maybe had honey instead of sugar in it, not sure.  4 stars because of the long wait and not quite enough food.  Otherwise I would have given it 5 because the East-Western was so yummy.",

Our most recent visit, when we got there with our 18 mth old they told us there was one couple ahead of us.  Ok, well if the hostess was doing her job she would have said 'its going to be a long wait because a long wait because we can only seat you at 2-3 tables and those tables were just seated'.   Seeing we have a toddler she would recognize this as important information! Instead we watched about 10-12 groups that arrived after us get seated and 45 mins later had a table.  The waitress acting like we were just a burden to even have to stop by our table.  Our food was stone cold when we got it about 20mins after ordering.  My husbands meal was grossly cold, 2 eggs over easy w turkey bacon and a biscuit was $7.95.   We were there for 1 hr and 50mins to get a nasty cold breakfast.   And its not a cheap breakfast stop for 4.5 people.  Regardless, my son was a saint, never complained or made noise, no messes.  The service and food has gotten worse over my last visits and now I am not going back though I use to go a few times a week since I live right in walking distance.",

Sunday is usually the OMG did I really drink ALL of that last night and the only thing that could make me feel better is the Bunny Ranchero day. Well, this Sunday was no different except we thought we could beat the crowd if we got up early. So we set the alarm and rolled outta bed, brushed the choppers and were there by 9:15 'ish. Dang if the patio wasn't completely filled already. Did these people sleep here? So, to the bar we went. Roger the owner is also the quirky fellow behind the bar. He always makes me laugh. On this occasion I decided against the Bunny Ranchero and switched it up for something sweet. I had the last piece of pecan cake which was just what the doctor ordered. Served on the cake plate itself with dollop's of whipped cream so you can saver all the crumbs, that, and a coffee in a chipped mug made me feel like I was home. I like the whole vegan, vegetarian vibe. I am not a fan of cows and piggies... I mean I like them so I don't eat them and for me, I feel like they have a great variety of protein options. I just wish so many others didn't feel the same way, well at least on Sunday mornings.",

Other times it's been slow and frustrating (messing up orders, not reflling coffee, etc.)  The food has been delicious on all but one occasion.

I get together with some colleagues here once a month for consultation and communion and we wouldn't go anywhere else.  I've only had lunch or supper here maybe once each, so I can't comment too much on either.  As for breakfast, however, this is where Zada's shines.  My favorite is the french toast, which is two thick and light pieces of brioche style bread, and is served with an orange zest butter.  I also love the bunny rancheros with chorizo, although they require a bib or a trip to the shower afterwards.  Think a pile of home fries and black bean with two over medium eggs, queso, sour cream, and guacamole on top with two flour tortilla.  I have recently been getting the east side hasher, which is sweet potato home fries with a meat (chorizo again, for me) and covered in scrambled eggs and cheese.  The biscuits are lovely.  They serve Grateful Growers products to support the local farmers.  All are delicious.  The only thing I've ever had that I didn't like was the pancakes, which I found heavy, although I've only tried them the one time.  The ambiance is funky and fun.  The music is eclectic and ranges from torch to rap.  The staff are helpful and friendly in a homey way.  There is local art for sale on all of the walls.  The prices are on the upper side of reasonable, but I'm willing to pay for creativity and to keep fun places in the neighborhood.  The best breakfast I've found in Charlotte (after pining for years for Lynn's Paradise Cafe in Louisville).",

We ordered the Spinach Dip, Calamari and some lovely Shrimp wrapped in Zuchini for appetizers, all good but the Shrimp were cooked to perfection and stood out. As well as our generous cocktails of course. The Crabcake I never tasted because I was busy with my Riccota Gnochi, blistered tomatoes and Skirt Steak, it was all good but the steak was a tad too much for me. I rarely eat Beef unless it melts in your mouth, I do more seafood or chicken. The meat was a tad chewy and I was full, I took it to go and gave it away but it was flavorful.

The service was great, the ambience is very friendly and I love the mixed coffee mugs, but what was actually on our plates could have used at the very least some salt and pepper, if not a whole flavor boost. I had the east-western, and I could pretty much only taste curry powder in the watery scrambled veggies. I knew it was just liquids from the spinach, but my dining partners were afraid I was eating very undercooked eggs. Unfortunately very bland for something that has so much potential... and it came with one slice of toast, I'm pretty sure any other restaurants' standard is two.  The booker t hasher was a bit better, but again only delivered hints of the expected flavors. The basic breakfast was just that, and eggs were cooked correctly.  With lines out the door every weekend I feel like I must be missing something, but maybe I need to try the lunch menu next time.",

There was gooey melted cheddar cheese on top with some chopped green onions for garnish. This was all layed on top of a bed of sweet potato hash, and came with a biscuit on the side. WONDERFUL. This was exactly what I wanted.  I recommend sitting at the counter-- the young lady there was so pleasant, and fun to talk to.

But I'm not a fan quite yet, and here's why: I'm not going to complain about the wait times, because like every other place that's small and popular, even Zada Janes has ridiculous wait times, especially on a Sunday at brunch time. It's a really cool looking place; colorful and lively. The ambiance is neat, the servers are friendly, the Bloody Mary looked fantastic (and I'm going back there, just to try it because I didn't the last time), the food however, and I'm talking strictly about the vegetarian food, was ehh ok.. We ordered three different dishes  - the east western (scrambled tofu in curry powder), the veg burger, and the No-Da salad. the salad was good, the tofu was alright - kinda bland, and the burger is not something I would eat again. It's definitely a place worth checking out, and I'm going to give it a second chance. This time I'll have the Bloody Mary, and try some of the non-vegetarian dishes, and then I'll come back and update my review.. or not :)",

The food can be rather hit or miss. The roasted potatoes are my staple food and they're good about 65% of the time, once though it seemed like they gave me potatoes that had been sitting out all day then thrown back in a skillet for 2 mins.  The staff is friendly as can be, the environment is pleasing, but the food quality varies too much.",

    "text": "I was looking for someplace new and fun to take an out-of-town friend for breakfast.  After running a quick search on Yelp, Zada Jane's popped up and it sounded like just what I was looking for.   We went on a chilly morning around 11:00 on a Monday (the MLK Jr. holiday) and it was quite busy.  Thankfully, not busy enough that we couldn't get a table, as I've heard the lines can be horrendous on Sunday mornings.  We were told to sit anywhere.  We sat far away from the door that people kept opening and letting in very cold air.   We were impressed by the menu offerings.  They were different and unique, as well as offering vegetarian options.  My friend and I both went with Booker T's East Side Hasher, which consisted of eggs, sausage (regular, turkey, or soy), and cheese atop sweet potato hashbrowns, served with a crispy biscuit.  Not to get technical, but the \"hashbrowns\" were actually home fries (i.e., cubed fried potatoes vs. shredded).  They not only were made from sweet potatoes, but also tasted like they were coated in a sweet honey.  YUM.  The eggs and biscuits were delicious, too.  Good choice!   And I agree with other reviewers that the coffee was excellent...although I would have liked more.  The service there isn't the fastest, and we didn't see our server that often (hence, only one refill on coffee).  After we finished our meal, another 15-20 minutes was added onto our time waiting for the bill and then paying for it.  Time that another good cup of coffee would have helped pass.    I'm looking forward to going back, but will go when time is not of the essence.  Food = good.  Service = average.",

The service was fine, and the menu selection was diverse with some very interesting vegan and vegetarian options.  When I ordered my breakfast combo, the menu indicated I could pick one protein and one carb - and the carb I requested was the cup of fruit.  To my surprise, the waitress told me that there was an upcharge for this - really? an upcharge for a few pieces of melon, when my other options were potatoes, gritz, and a variety of other pretty unhealthy choices!    The food itself was just decent...my scrambled eggs weren't very warm and weren't overly exciting - the turkey bacon had a unique taste and was pretty good, but the biscuit I had seemed rather old, as it was really dried out.    Overall Zada had a nice feel to it, a very unique place with unique menu selections, but I left rather disappointed.",

Pretty cool stuff all over the place like the rooster painting and figurines as well as the framed record covers.    It wasn't crowded but there was only one waitress and a bartender that was also waiting some tables, so service was a bit slow but they were super friendly and helpful.    I got the vegan soup that was described as, \"vegetable soup\" and was surprised by the intense cinnamon aroma.  It was a generous serving but wasn't  impressed by the flavor, or lack there of, aside from the overwhelming cinnamon that seemed to blanket all of the actual vegetable flavor.  I doused it in hot sauce in attempt to over ride the cinnamon to no avail. However, the house salad with homemade tomato vinaigrette dressing was great!  And my partner in crime thought the meklenburger and mashed potatoes were tasty!",

So I'll focus on the service, since I'm confident you'll be happy with the food.   Be prepared for long intervals between touch points. It took the bartender over five minutes to greet me. Then after receiving my glass of water, I had to flag her down to remind her about my MIA coffee. By the time I finally received my food, I'd been seated more than an hour. (Thankfully I'd brought a book)   I noticed the same lack of follow through with other patrons--some of whom waited more than ten minutes to be greeted.   The incoming phone calls seemed to be a real curve ball as well. Several times throughout my last visit, there were instances when the ringing phone took precedence over the customer in the midst of placing her order. That just seems backwards to me.   Get it together, ZJ!",

    "text": "Came here on Sunday with my husband around 3pm for a super late lunch....though we stuck with breakfast options, since they serve breakfast all day!  Since it was so nice outside, we chose to sit at a table on their side patio. Also, since it was 3pm, it wasn't that crowded.....though, past experiences walking by this place around brunch time is that it seems to get crazy busy.  I ordered a mimosa and my husband ordered a beer. There draft selection isn't that great but the two that they had on draft were local. The mimosa was a perfect mix of OJ and Champagne...aka, heavy on the champagne!  We decided to split something, since all the food coming out looked like huge portions. We ordered the Huevos Rancheros with the Chipotle Chicken. Holy, amazing flavor! I mean this dish was so tasty.....chicken, potatos, ranchero sauce, queso sauce, black beans, all with 2 eggs on top. Man, my mouth is just watering thinking about that sauce on it! It came with two tortilla shells....though, with the portion size, 2 wasn't really enough. However, I would actually recommend this dish sans-tortilla anyways. The portion was HUGE. We kept talking about how we have zero clue how many people could eat this by themselves. I felt overly full with just a half a portion! Totally recommend this!  My husband also ordered two pancakes (no clue how we actually ate them though....bottomless pit). I had a bite of them. They were very good, nothing out of this world, but very good. I think they added some spice to them that gave them an extra little something.   Just a note, in the 30 minutes that we ordered, got, and ate our meal, like over 5 orderes of nachos came out (for different tables). We kept saying how we must have missed the memo on ordering nachos....if that many people get them, they must be pretty good. Huge looking serving in a bowl with guac. Will try next time!",

Went last night and couldn't  find a lot that I wanted to eat since I don't eat chicken, pork, beef,  bison, etc.  No more NoDa Salad or Kafka burger for dinner.  Orr server informed us that these items are only available for lunch.  No soup offered either.    I really hadn't planned on spending more than $20 but with wine ($8) and my main course which was either $16 or $18, it was a lot more.  Also, when our server said bottles of wine were half-priced on Sundays, I switched from ordering a beer to a Cotes du Rhone.  However, she brought a glass of wine and not a bottle of wine, and when I asked about the bottle, her response was \"this was what you ordered, wasn't it?\".  So, she either wasn't paying attention when I ordered or just forgot by the time she ordered it since I didn't see her write it down. All in all, an OK evening.  At least the weather outside was gorgeous.  I probably will stick to breakfast or lunch from now on since the evening menu is now very meat heavy.  No pasta options as on the previous menu. (I will certainly miss the shroom ravioli!)",

The salads they have are amazing- super filling, as they are chock full of goodies.   The NoDa salad is AMAZING. Delicious marinated tofu, crunchy sunflower seeds, tomatoes, cheese- I fell in love. The breakfast salad is amazing too. It inspired me to make breakfast salads at home for weeks after!  This spot is perfect for lunch or a weekday breakfast- weekend brunch get crazy, I have heard so pop in when you don't have to wait!",

Parking can be tight in the small lot around the back, but patrons may utilize the communal parking in the diagonal lot across Central Avenue.    There's an outdoor patio that is packed with the weather is nice and some outdoor games to be played, including cornhole. There are certainly some busier times when there can be a bit of a wait as well.  Typically a Saturday or Sunday morning you'll find yourself waiting for sure.    The ingredients used are local and the decor is quirky.  The coffee is served in a variety of random mugs that only add to the character of the space.  Definitely a hipster haven.  I've only ever been for breakfast, but I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered.  The \"Bunny Rancheros\" are where it's at though!   They are only open for breakfast and lunch, so get there early if you want to give it a try.",

Ha.   -First trip: Easter Sunday morning like 10-11. Sat right away outside patio. Love that they have shuffle board & corn hole right out front to play. Let's be real, their whole patio setup is nice and that's why it's always poppin'! We ordered fairly quickly. Mostly breakfast foods, but they do have some salads. It was hard to choose but we ordered:  *Booker Ts sweet potato hash!* hands down my most favorite breakfast I've had, okay top five. It's basically this delicious omelette with sweet potato hash underneath. This combo is brilliant. It's tastes heavenly. Which brought me back to round two, see second trip ). $12 *hot central coffee for $3 with refills.  *side of turkey bacon $3 (yum) *carrot cake pancakes. Um yummy! Not as sweet as it sounds. Wasn't on the menu, was a special and cost $13...prob wouldn't have spent that much on pancakes had I known that originally. But was good, just not that good if you know what I mean.   -Second trip: Saturday morning like 10:30-11. Could not just sit outside, had to see host for all seating since they were even busier. Host said 15-25 mins. More like 35 so be prepared to wait to get seated. And also for your food! The first trip was 30 min food wait once ordered. Second time almost that long. *They go slow here, no rush, go with the flow vibes* but worth the wait if you have time to do so. Both times I enjoyed my food to say the least. (I had booker T for food, a iced latte second trip $4? Good!)   Love me some Zada Jane's. Prob gonna be my fav brunch in my new neighborhood. Thanks Zj",

Short version: I went for breakfast/brunch and I enjoyed everything I had. The service was great. Parking in the lot is very limited but parallel parking on the street is also available (I was there on a weekday around 11:30am). Definitely try it especially if you have been to eateries in Asheville and like that vibe.  Long version: Had a brunch with some peeps we ordered a Breakfast Salad, Booker T's Sweet Potato Hash and Belvedere Omelet (I'm actually missing one dish because I can't remember what it was) and a side of Gluten Free pancake.  Everything was delicious. Everyone loved their food. The Gluten Free pancake was the best GF pancake I had ever had that wasn't made at home. I also ordered an orange juice because it's one of the few places that actually has fresh squeezed.  One of the members in my party was celebrating a birthday and they were kind enough to bring out a slice of Red Velvet cake for her.   Overall, it was a great experience and would like to return. I don't know how they fair on weekends but they don't have a huge amount of seating indoors but do have a patio area with fire pits and that section is pet friendly. There is free parking on the side streets and their lot offers rooms for about 8-10 cars so get there early!",

Ordered an iced coffee and the bunny rancheros! They were so so good.  Bunny rancheros is more than enough food for me and oh so delicious.

We were told we needed to wait outside in the rain and they would call our name.  At 30, we decided to check our place in line inside since multiple people who showed up after us, but apparently knew the staff, were seated ahead of us.  We were told they called our name already and they had crossed our name off the list.  They said they would seat us next.  When that didn't happen,  we told the hostess again about our situation.  With many open tables and bar seats at this point,  she sat us without saying anything and just throwing the menus down and walking away.  After that,  we watched the scene around us and it was clear the was no order to how they work and no manager keeping things in line.   As far as the coffee and food goes,  one of the dishes was great (Bunny Rancheros) and the other wasn't (Hash).  The coffee was pretty fantastic as well.  The food wait wasn't bad.     Moving here from a different city with a more established and tenured food scene, I can imagine this is the type of place that gets pushed out as the food scene evolves in Charlotte.   The staff doesn't care and that probably means the owner doesn't either.  Sad to see.",

There was a 20 min wait, so we walked to a local coffee shop to burn some time. We were seated (inside) soon after we returned. The restaurant is quaint, but bright, and its motley decor adds to its Southern charm.   Soft spoken Steven was our server. He did a good job covering the featured items and answering questions.  We ordered a few things to assess the menu. My entree was the crab omelette with herb potatoes. We also ordered jalapeno grits. The potatoes were well seasoned and those grits were really good with so much flavor packed into that little cup. However, the omelette didn't live up to my expectations. The egg base was really thick and over cooked. Also, the Boursin cheese that adds the creaminess was not evenly distributed. That omelette could have been a lot better with a little attention.   My gf had this local favorite bookmarked for quite sometime so I was glad to try it out. Not sure when I'll return but it was a pleasant experience nonetheless.",

After 40 minutes I checked the list and there were still a few names ahead of us. The restaurant has a lot of 2-tops so smaller parties  were being called before us. When I checked back a few minutes later my name had been crossed off! Not sure what happened since we were standing within earshot of the hostess the whole time. She offered to seat us right away but warned that the kitchen was backed up (apparently only 2 cooks even on a busy Sunday) and we might not get our food for another 50 minutes. We left instead.... I wish I'd read the reviews because it seems like an understaffed kitchen is common.",

It wasn't until I had a pleasant conversation with a Zada Jane's founder that I learned this feeling is not a coincidence, or blind admiration, but instead a calculated effort. \"I love Asheville\" he said. \"I lived there for many years and miss going to places like Sunny Point. Charlotte needs more places like that.\" I couldn't agree more.   The food has been above average the half-dozen meals I've had at Zada's, though somewhat inconsistent. It seems the later it is, with fewer people inside, the better the food tastes. You certainly won't find a better eggs dish any where in town at 9:45pm on a weeknight.     If located in downtown Asheville, Zada's may be viewed in a different light. It's out matched by Sunny Point and Over Easy. But in the Queen City, Zada's it's in a class of it's own.",

At that point, I run for Landmark, and curse the concept of brunch.  But anyway. So the prices are a little high and the portions are a little small, but remember that most of the produce is sourced locally (think the same goes for the eggs and dairy, don't hold me to that though), which is a departure from your normal-arty-eggs-and-bacon breakfast joint, at least in CLT. Coffee is tops and DARK (yay!!) and yes, its extremely vegetarian friendly. There's even an amazing vegan breakfast option that I end up getting half the time, since it's so tasty. If you've ever tried to make tofu scramble really \"work\" as an egg substitute, you understand how challenging that can be!  Lunch works, but even if it's 3pm, I'm ordering breakfast. Unless I'm ordering the veggie nachos. Good lord, those are tasty. We've also tried their dinner menu, and found it very expensive, if artful. The service at night (different manager) was pretty terrible, so we'll stick to ZJ's before 4.",

I love to go here, sit on the patio and nosh on a big honkin' Bunny Rancheros egg-stravaganza and have the fluffy homemade biscuit smothered in local apple butter for dessert. They make a mean Bloody Mary, too. There's always good rock and roll music playing, lots of local color to enjoy, and a varied menu with something for everyone.   The biggest problem with Zada Jane's, as I see it, is its popularity. Because the indoor area is on the small size, inclement or cold weather can bring everyone indoors. It has also become a destination spot for Sunday brunch, so the wait is long and service is slow. If you're chill, however, there's nothing homier or more welcoming than a visit to ZJ's. You'll leave with a full tummy and a head full of good karma.",

Combine that with the often long wait times, practically non-existent parking, and the crazy price for a plain, old cup-o-coffee, I can understand how some folks aren't fans of this quirky spot.   With that being said, I still love Zada Jane's. I just know now what to expect going there. I've only ever eaten here for breakfast, so my experiences are based on that alone. I love the sweet potato hashbrowns. The Belvedere Omelet is almost always good (the one time it was made incorrectly, the server made me feel bad for pointing out their error, never offered to make me a new one, and balked when I asked for a discount after I ate way less than half of it - that's an example of the questionable customer service we've gotten here). However, their biscuits are really good and the berry jam & apple butter they have on the tables are ah-may-zing. Those condiments alone are reason to dine here, which is often what we're craving when we brace ourselves for the drive, the parking lot, the long wait & the so-so service, but for some reason, we keep coming back for the unique and usually yummy food choices.",

Very eclectic, with a neat mix of neighborhood folks and a wonderful breakfast menu.  So, in my head it became a breakfast place.  However, my husband has gone there several times for dinner at times when I've been out of town or unable to join him, and he always said it was good.    Last night, I was craving something a little naughty (you know, cheesy, gooey, etc).  We were having a hard time trying to decide where to go, and I happened upon the Zada Jane's website and menu.  They have a really cool interpretation of nachos that sounded so good to me that we decided to go there.  Even after hearing about the specials, I stuck to my initial idea about the nachos, with chicken on top.    Let me just tell you, I couldn't have been more pleased.  They have black beans, grilled zucchini, and corn covered in a very creamy manchego cheese sauce, topped with guacamole and sour cream.  So, it was a healthy-ier version of nachos with all of the yummy stuff that makes nachos great!  This is something that I'll order again (and again), and changed my thoughts about Zada Jane's being just a breakfast place.  It is actually a great neighborhood spot for any time of day.    The wait staff is incredibly friendly, and the chocolate cake rocked.  Go try Zada Jane's!",

Foodwise: I ordered the biscuit, happy egg with cheese and a side of French toast. I was a little surprised at the length of time it took until we were able to order our food (it was busy at the restaurant but not THAT busy). Eggs were delicious, biscuit with homemade raspberry jam was stellar. I was however disappointed with the French toast, the toast was great but the menu indicated a slice of French toast and apparently that actually translates to a half a slice of French toast... My friends really enjoyed the breakfast sandwich, the bunny rancheros, the basic breakfast and the pancakes - not the sweet potatoes. Unfortunately, we were charged for the coffee we were offered while we waited that they said was complimentary.",

    "text": "Today I made my second attempt at Zada Janes. A few month ago a few of us went for brunch but after hearing the wait was over 45 minutes and observing every table without food and only drinks... we decided to leave.   Fast forward to today. We arrived around 10 am on a Saturday and didn't have to wait at all. Yay! I'll be honest... I had very low expectations after reading reviews and my first attempt. I was pleasantly surprised that our waitress was prompt and checked in with us frequently to make sure our drinks were full and food was up to par. The mimosas were the perfect ratio of champagne and orange juice. Big plus. I ordered a classic meal of scrambled eggs, turkey bacon, grits and toast and my friend had the Booker T. Highly recommend you try the grits (SO good) and the Booker T!  This is a very trendy restaurant with beautiful artwork and a fun, chill atmosphere. Parking isn't bad either... just grab a spot in the lot behind the building.  Also, it's a dog friendly place. There were tons of pups out on the patio and it looked like the restaurant may have provided them with water bowls. Love it.   Overall, highly recommend and like others have said... expect a wait (grab a cup of coffee or a mimosa- or two) or just go earlier and you shouldn't have an issue.",

I have to say that the man is a GENIUS. He touches restaurants and they turn to gold. I love a good dinner spot. Breakfast and lunch is good, but I love a good dinner spot. The last time I was here was for dinner, and let me tell you that the the shrimp and grits with fresh okra is a secret North Carolina touch that did just that....it touched my soul. I may be living in Chicago, but I'm a southern boy  and love me some shrimp and grits. Thank you Chef for sharing the love.  M",

The place is pretty popular so expect a wait if you arrive after 9:00 a.m. on the weekends. They do offer coffee while you wait but I'm just not a big fan of their coffee. On my last visit (which was in Oct 2013) I ordered the blazing saddles omelet with biscuit and sweet potato hash browns. The biscuit was pretty dry and the sweet potatoes were a handful of cubed sweet potatoes. The omelet was a good size and was the best tasting part of the meal.   I'm willing to try other things on the menu but don't have high hopes. There are many other options for a solidly good breakfast in Charlotte, I wouldn't put this place on the list.",

So I placed the order and I then notice a lot of people who came in after me, received there order around the 30 min time. I kept asking about the order and then she kept being rude and said it will take another 10 min. I saw more people come in after me getting their order and then after another 10 min, I asked again and she said another 10 min. I about had it that time. So I stayed because I prepaid for my order and after a hour and some minutes, I was right beside her and she knew my order and then screams my name like I was outside. Everyone looked at her and I'm pissed because I'm right beside her and that was really uncalled for. I wanted to be the bigger person there and just leave.

We were seated after about 20 mins and our waitress was just very...odd. Not rude, but also just kind of annoyed that we were ready to order (we didn't want to waste our whole day sitting around so we ordered drinks and food together when she came around the first time.   My husband ordered pancakes and they were fine. I ordered bunny rancheros with bacon...it showed up as a hot mess and nothing like the other pictures I saw on yelp. Even though my side was bacon, they crumbled it up and it was all over the plate, under eggs, under potatoes, etc. I'm not sure why I wasn't given a couple slices of bacon on the side. It was all ok, but not worth the wait.",

I went for a splurge with the Breakfast burger which I order medium rare. My date also got the Meatloaf burger. The food took quite a long time to come out. We were the only guest in the restaurant which seemed like an open invitation for our server to invite herself to never leave out table. It was a bit annoying to be unable to speak to the person I can with 90% of the meal. She was kind and I don't think she knew what she was doing but you have to take social clues as a server. Finally she went and got our food and my burger was beyond well done. Super dry and just completed over cooked. My boyfriend was supposed to have a slice of meatloaf on her burger but it was just a normal burger patty. The only True positive is the Chai Latte and the Jalapeno bacon Mac side item. It isn't worth the price in my opinion. I have a hard time giving this place the 2 stars I think it really deserves because I truly love coming here for coffee.",

Luckily, Zada was just located about 5 mins from where I was staying in the Plaza Midwood area. We sat in their outside seating and let the heat burn our arms while people watching I call it LOL. After about 5 mins, a gentleman came out and took our order. While we waited we were given some ice cold water to quench our thirst. Luckily, it didn't take long for our meals to come out. There was a lot to choose from but I ended up ordering the \"Blazing Saddles\", which consisted of an perfectly made omelet filled with chicken, black beans, pepper jack & jalapenos (watch out for the heat!) topped with salsa and sour cream. The sides consisted of toast & herb roasted potatoes. This was by far one of the best brunch meals I've ever had & can't wait to come back!  So if you ever have Charlotte on your list of travels be sure to bookmark this place & enjoy the view !",

    "text": "Sigh. So this is my review after visiting twice.    Midwood Plaza   Very chill, welcoming and eclectic vibe   Great pricing on food and drinks    customer service 3 / 5    DO - order specialty coffee or take advantage of the coffee carafes while you wait. If you're flexible with where you sit, DO opt for first available.  Do not make your own meal, they truly thrive in their dishes.    My thoughts / Review-   My first visit was on Mother's Day weekend and it was busy as expected. Our server was great considering the  hustle and bustle of a busy day. I appreciated that he made an effort in asking my daughter for her order (she's 4) and really loves being included at restaurants! So, thank you!   I ordered the Booker T's Eastside Hasher with soysage, my daughter ordered the pancakes and eggs and my husband built his own omelette. The food was great! I would absolutely order my dish again.   My second visit was during PRIDE Charlotte and it was busy! We opted to do First Available as the wait was rather long. We were seated outside on the patio and as much as I wanted to enjoy that experience, it was too hot and the area doesn't get a good breeze.  Couple that with a server who seemed aloof and took forever to get our order, bring silverware, etc. On top of that we all made our own orders and I'll never do that again. The grits were too salty, pancakes were gummy (possibly undercooked) and the soysage was bland.",

My boyfriend and I have the day off and decided to pop over to Zada Jane's for Friday breakfast around 11. We walked in to find a fairly substantial line, and were told the wait would be about an hour as they were understaffed. Totally understandable - it's the day after a holiday and people call in.. but there were 5+ tables with no one there that just hadn't been cleared. We waited. And waited. The 4 parties ahead of us got tired of waiting for these very tables and dropped off one by one. 30 minutes later, there were even more deserted tables with no acknowledgement by the slow moving staff. We asked for the open seats at the bar, expecting somewhat faster service, but were told those were treated like a table as well. Of the very few people remaining seated in the restaurant at tables, they still had not received their food and were looking around annoyed.   After so long waiting, I felt invested, but decided it was better to cut our losses and venture elsewhere as ZJ clearly was not looking to make any money today.",

We both (my hubby and me) had a great brunch dish, mine was a sweet potato hash with a TLC biscuit... and that was some tender loving care for my belly!

    "text": "I normally don't like to complain because I've worked in restaurants for years, but I've eaten here 3 or 4 times and after yesterday, I will not go back. Every time I've been here my servers have been rude, slow, or forgot my table completely.   Yesterday I went in for brunch; my boyfriend and I put our name down for a table. There was only one other group in front of us and two or three groups that came in after. We got drinks and waited by the bar to be seated after being told it would be 10-15 minutes. Over 20 minutes went by and no one said anything to us. The manager or owner, who took our name down, walked by us multiple times and repeatedly avoided eye contact. I also overheard her talking sh*t about her customers to one of the servers behind the bar. By this time there was an empty table with dirty plates still on it and two separate areas at the bar open that needed to be cleared. The manager was walking around slowly with 0 sense of urgency or just standing around half of the time. She was clearing plates from peoples tables while completely ignoring the empty tables that were dirty despite the fact that she had multiple people waiting to be seated.   At this point, I noticed that people who came in after us had already been seated. Finally I caught one of the server's attention - he was the only person who acknowledged us in the 30 minutes we were standing around waiting. I asked if we could be seated at one of the empty spots and he sat us right away. He made our experience much better, he was very friendly and bubbly and checked on us multiple times during the meal. However, our food took at least 20 minutes to come out and the portions were pathetic. My boyfriend got a \"side\" of bacon which were the two smallest pieces of bacon I've ever seen, and his French toast was also very small and not worth the price. Half of my food was cold as well. The food at this place is not good enough to deal with the awful service, especially from the woman who appeared to be the manager/owner. There are plenty of other worthwhile places to eat in plaza midwood.",

I would hands down recommend the Bunny Rancheros, with each bite the entree became better. The portions are huge and you leave feeling full and happy.  Would definitely recommend taking your out of town guest here it's a good brunch place.  My only drawback there was that their espresso machine was broke and they didn't have any chorizo when they had only been open for an hour. Other than that staff was very friendly, it was clean, and food was delicious. Would highly recommend.",

There is typically about a 45 minutes to and hour wait because it's just that popular. Centrally located in Plaza Midwood, the outdoor patio seating is nice. We came in for a late brunch so we were seated in about 30 minutes which was great.   It was our server's 3rd day on the job which was sort of annoying because he didn't know the menu well. My friends asked a few questions that he wasn't sure of. We waited a while for our food but that's to be expected with a large party. Everyone's food was pretty good except a few entrees were slightly cold. No major complaints!  The breakfast salad is delicious. The egg was cooked well and the sun-dried tomato vinaigrette pairs well with everything.   All in all, Zada Jane's is a neighborhood favorite and will keep coming here for the food, the atmosphere, and for the close-knit neighborhood feel.",

I went in and got the grande breakfast that came with 1 pancake, soysasuage, eggs, and sweet potato hash browns. Now, I'd eaten here a few weeks back and could not get enough of the pancakes, but this  go round my breakfast was subpar to say the least.   Every time I come here, it takes them at least 15 mins to greet me and I sit at the bar, so I just don't understand. I watched several other patrons get seated and drinks, that came in after me before I even got a hello. That's something that seriously needs to be worked on with the restaurant. It's not the first time this has happened.   The food this time was ok, but I was just expecting a little more BANG like I had with the food the previous week. I don't know, maybe they had someone new cooking. Great location, great little meet up spot for lunch with friends, or just to take a book to read and eat!",

Cute eclectic vibe, and once we were finally seated the service was excellent. I wanted to stray away from my usual brunch go-to items and try something unique, so I ordered the Booker T's East Side hash with soysage. This was not great for me - strange combo of sweet and savory and enough [unmelted] cheese that I could feel my arteries clogging as I ate. I didn't find the dish to be particularly flavorful until I poured on a ton of hot sauce. I will say the TLC biscuit was fantastic.  Portion sizes are big, lots of veggie substitutions are available, and the servers are friendly... but the food missed the mark for me. If I returned, I'd stick with Benedicts or rancheros.",

We arrived today (Sunday) at about 9am and we're immediately seated with a choice of inside or out. We chose outside as the weather was perfect!   The patio seats about 10 parties with tables with umbrellas. It's a sizeable patio too, the tables aren't on top of each other.    Our waitress came to take our drink orders and asked if we had any questions about the menu. When she returned with our drinks she took our food order.   I ordered the Zada Jane's 28205 (2 eggs any style, 1 protein, 1 carb and your choice of toast or a biscuit), my husband ordered the Grande Quande (which was all the above plus a pancake), my friend ordered the frittata  The entrees took about 15-20 minutes to come out of the kitchen, but when they did they were brought out by the chef who was so proud to be presenting the food! Everything looked incredible - and everything tasted great!   My husband ordered fruit as his carb - it was a beautiful medley of blackberries, melons, strawberries and pineapples. I ordered the sweet potato hash which was cooked perfectly and was so tasty!!! Sweet and savory. The biscuit - hands down charlottes best. It was fluffy and warm!   Parking can be a little tricky. There is a small lot that gets filled quickly and then lots of street parking.   We cannot wait to return to Zada Jane's soon!",

The mushrooms were undercooked, but maybe southerners can't cook mushrooms as well as pennsylvanians (you know cause most mushrooms are grown there haha).  The roasted potatoes were delicious.

But, if you go on a weekend, you have to expect it to be busy. There are not many solid brunch places in Charlotte. So this one is popular. Plan on waiting 30-40 minutes. And the hostess we have mainly dealt with can be a bit...ditzy? I don't know. She is sweet, but disappears a lot... doesn't really know how to properly judge you wait time (we were once told 10 minutes when there were about 5 parties in front of us on a Saturday morning at 10. Nope). If you go expecting to spend a leisurely time... you are set!",

Unfortunately the lunch options were few - salads and a few sandwiches. I had a hard time finding anything to order. I got the chopped salad, which was huge, and my husband got the spinach salad which was not as big. The salads were good but nothing I  could not fix on my own, although the dressings seem housemade and the caesar dressing was nice and peppery.  But, the service was really slow. I mean these were salads - how long could it really take? All in all I was not thrilled but would like to try for brunch or maybe dinner, on the feeling that lunch is not their strong suit. As a last note, the Asian vegetable soup was very flavorful and the standout.",

I ordered scrambled eggs, turkey bacon, herbed spuds and a pancake along w/orange juice and a coffee.  The eggs were okay, the turkey bacon tasted like a cheap store bought brand, it was very chewy and didn't have a good flavor at all, the herbed spuds tasted like they forgot them in the oven all morning.  They were very, very dry and shriveled up, not plump w/a good potatoey texture at all.  The pancake was great!  It was cooked just perfect, soft n fluffy with a perfect crispy edge all around! The coffee was great.  I expected the oj to be fresh, but to my dismay it was a carton brand.  Service was good and the waiter who I think is the owner from the reviews I read sat down in the booth right next to me to take my order, heck he was damn near sitting on my lap! Lol!  Unless I'm craving only pancakes n coffee I may be back, but I doubt it.",

The waitress, Rachel P, must of forgot to ring in the pancake and so we waited an additional 15 min for ONE pancake. The food was OK. The pancake was nearly $3 and was the size of a sand dollar! Definitely not a place I would suggest to ANYBODY, especially if you expect good customer service. I am being nice and giving them 2 stars because you could tell that the concept was great, but without solid customer service and a time-efficient process, you will fail every time.",

This is my starting point, one review down 51 left to go.   My steak sandwich was cooked quite well, and piled full of tender pieces of steak. Unfortunately the same can't be said for my friends food. Both got sandwiches and one side each, small portions all around except mine. I felt many of the options were a little pricy, but that could just be me.  My waitress was very awesome, she even checked on the name of a song that was playing for a friend of mine.  Yeah the inside is \"funky\" and \"creative\" so is Fuel down the street, and most other places in plaza midwood. So that alone wouldn't be enough to draw me in. Final verdict. My meal was filling, but then again I believe they used a whole cow for mine.  We had to stop at McDonald's for one of the group because of such small serving sizes. So chances are it was a one stop place",

Since my one of them is a vegetarian I thought this would be a perfect place. The food truly was great and everyone loved it, however the service was really disappointing. I'm REALLY easy to please, but I get really turned off when there's a lack of basic customer service. Our waitress Rachel was extremely rude. We were seated outside and when she came - there was no \"Hello\" or \"How are you?\" or even a smile. She asked if we know what we would like to drink after looking at the menu for only a few minutes. We gave her our drink order and after 5 minutes only 3 drinks came out (we were 4 people). After about 10 minutes she came and all she said \"Oh you, don't have your drink. Do you know what you want to eat?\" Then another 10 minutes went by just waiting for my drink without saying \"I'll check on it\" or \"I'm sorry for the wait\". It took 20 minutes to get the bloody mary only ... let alone the food. That was the last time we saw her for the day. She didn't bring our food, she went around other tables checking on them, but didn't even ask one time if we wanted any refills or how our food is or if we need anything in general. She wasn't even around for us to ask for our bill so we had to flag down a different waitress by the name Alexandra who was actually very sweet. We had a really bad experience and I felt bad that my friends who were visiting were getting such poor service from Rachel after I've been telling them how warm and friendly people are in Charlotte. It was my first time coming at Zada Jane's and the food was great, but because of the lack of customer service I don't think I'll be a returning customer.",

The manager came to speak to us and offered me a $25 gift card. So I will be going back there at least one more time.",

    "text": "The food is pretty delicious and unique and the location is quite charming, and the prices are reasonable. So why am I being stingy with my stars? Well the service here is really quite horrible. Maybe I caught our waitress on a bad day or something but she couldn't possibly have been more rude or nasty.  It all begins when we walked into the place and no one decides to talk to us for about 10 minutes until I walk up to the counter and am told I can just sit anywhere. Okay understandable, I wish you had told me that earlier when I had walked in. Anyways I ask if we can move the tables around outside and the girl at the bar says sure thing. While sitting there waiting for the rest of the party to arrive, our waitress comes up and asks if we're sure they're coming. I feel like this was kind of a veiled attempt to ask if me if the rest of the party ditched us, and am tempted to give a sarcastic response but instead ask for a glass of water. She never brings any water. So finally everyone's arrived and the drink orders are taken before she brings any water around. I'm pretty excited about the food because it was a pretty delicious sounding menu. It takes a really long time for our food to come out even though there's only one other table of four there with us, but that's okay because we're having fun chatting and discussing the rest of the night out. Well the food finally comes out and I ask her if she could take a picture of us. She's like well how about I make sure everyone's happy with their stuff before I get around to you okay? Well excuse me! I wasn't aware that taking 10 seconds out of her busy schedule of ignoring my empty water glass to take a picture was going to bother her that much. And yes I did ask for my water glass to be filled but she never did get around to it, and disappeared off somewhere until it came time for the check.  I almost didn't tip her but I convinced myself to anyways since I still managed to have a good time despite all that. I don't think I'll ever be back unless I get dragged back though. I love the food and the atmosphere, but I like my food without a side of bad attitude, and I don't enjoy getting ignored either. I can think of places just as good that treat me with respect.",

Its definitely the neighborhood hang out so don't expect to have service that quick or food that is warm every time to you come. Expect a casual, laid back experience.   I had their veggie sandwich and \"forced theM\" to add turkey. Which I might get shunned for every time I go ... the sandwich was amazing however.

It looked like a cute little breakfast spot, in a hip part of town, the food when it came out looked good, but as soon as I started eating, was disappointed. I had the two egg special (scrambled) with bacon, herb spuds and a biscuit with a side of gravy. My scrambled eggs were fine, although a lack of flavor makes me think they weren't fresh eggs, my herb spuds were the consistency of cold French fries and only lukewarm, again not flavorful, despite obvious herbs on them. These two things alone would normally make me think it might just be a bad morning for the wait staff and my plate had sat under the heat lamp too long. It was the thin, Jim Beam's-looking bacon that had crunch but nothing else and the bland gravy that made me think Zada Jane was all street appeal. The ingredients didn't taste fresh, the gravy tasted like it was from a mix (if it was from scratch the components must've been lacking to begin with), and the coffee was only, not-unbearable, on top of an unsmiling wait staff. Not sure Charlotte has anything better, so I might be back, but I won't care either way.",

After checking yelp for the local restaurants, we decided to go to Zada Janes because my husband is a big omelette fan and he especially love the build your own.  So we pull into the small ten car only parking lot which could be a pain which we realize when it was time for us to leave. Someone parked right behind us, so being the great driver that I am, had to maneuver my way out of the space. FYI, back in to the parking space instead of pulling in.   The outside of the building represents the neighborhood very well, very hip and artsy. Also the inside have local artists work, which keeps u intrigue while waiting for your food. It was semi busy, right before the noon lunch crowd. Server was nice and polite and helped us will some of the ingredients, but a little standoffish.  Anyway we both ordered build your own omelettes, his with hashbrowns, and mine with a biscuit, since I wanted to try the apple butter that heard about. Receive meal 20 mins later and was surprised by the size of the omealette. It looked delicious and was good too. My hubby, the omealette conoseiuer just thought it was ok, average. Hashbrowns were average in my opinion though.   I would definitely go back, if in the area, but I wouldn't drive across town to get there.",

I'm not sure if I'd get that one again but I'd be willing to try something different on the menu. They also have a great menu for vegetarians, offering soysauge. First time I've ever heard of it but my friend who's a vegetarian really likes it. I also wasn't a fan of their coffee but that may be my preference  Definitely in a nice area though.

I'm here on a bustling Sunday morning with my laptop at the bar. As I look around, literally everyone is smiling, including the wait staff. You can tell they love working here, and it shows.   Being a bit of an espresso snob, I was a little hesitant to order it at a restaurant like this, but I was not disappointed. My 4-shot iced espresso is fabulous.   I noticed the person next to me had a huge plate of goodness: Potatoes, meat, over medium eggs, guacamole, sour cream, tortillas... I knew I had to have it. So I ordered the Bunny Rancheros... and I haven't looked back since.   The guac is fresh, the chorizo has a complex depth of flavor, the over-medium eggs are cooked to perfection, and they even have the best hot sauce in the world already on the table: Texas Pete.   So, here are some things that would usually bother me if I was in a terrible mood. The parking is scarce- in fact, I just turned around to make sure they weren't towing my car because of my awkward parking space. It's busy and it's loud- so if you're trying to have a quiet, intimate conversation, this isn't the place.  The service does take a while, which would usually bother me, but each bite made up for each minute I waited. I also rarely ever spend a good $12 on a coffee and breakfast--I author the website BROKE & Healthy--but trust me when I say that it's worth your money.   In my opinion, Zada Jane's has lived up to the hype.",

I adore this local gem and can forgive its short comings so-so service and all. My favorite is the bunny rancheros from the breakfast served all day menu. What a heaping of fresh food. However, I visiting Zada Janes last Sunday with a Groupon. I have never been hassled more for using a Groupon- even at sustainably more expensive establishments. For you see, a business chooses to send out a Groupon with the hope of attracting new or repeat customers. Since it was Sunday we enjoyed a bottle of half priced wine and then were told that since we had participated in this \"deal\" that we wouldn't be able to use our Groupon. Well- our Groupon did not apply to alcohol purchased so there would not have not been any additional discounts on that \"sale\" purchase. Instead of handling this with a smile we were lectured for several minutes about how we should have known better. I was so dismayed and as I explained- we live in the neighborhood- really enjoy eating here and will be back without a Groupon next time we come. Still- the lecture continued about combining discounts- on a Groupon that had none of this fine print. This last experience at Zada Janes really undid the delicious taste of my steak pita wrap and creme brulee  and apple cake desserts we ordered.  Yes- we did tip on the full undiscounted amount of the check. I'm all for supporting local business but this was a very negative experience on what I hoped would have been a relaxing Sunday evening night out.",

I usually get the Zada Janer - two eggs cooked any way you like, a protein (i get soysage), a carb (grits - they are great), and either a biscuit or toast (I go with the biscuit). It seems boring, but it is fabulous and plenty filling. They have fun variations on the traditional breakfast, as well. The Bunny Rancheros is a spin on the breakfast burrito, complete with guacamole, and the Booker T's is eggs, cheese, hash browns, etc. all layered into one big dish.   The only downside to Zada Jane's is that on the weekends, there can be a bit of a wait. I usually try to get there before 11, however, if you get there after, it can get up to 45 minutes, especially on Sundays with the church crowd. When it is cool, it is nice to sit outside though, and they have shuffle board and cornhole courts outside, and you can pour yourself a cup of coffee while you wait. In my opinion, Zada Jane's is worth the 45 minute wait.",

I absolutely hate coffee and all that it stands for, but when the waitress suggested that I should still try because it was that amazing, I decide to just give a try. I am glad I did.  At the time i went the coffee was local roasted by Dilworth Coffee and had a distinct flavor I had yet to taste  in this city. Maybe it was the french or maybe it was my imagination but it was AMAZING!  The food portions were adequate and tasted delicious.

So after some research and reading reviews about Zada Jane's and looking at the menu we decided this was the place. My major turning point for selecting this place was because of the menu. It is different and that is what I like. (P.s my review and D G's are very similar because I am \"the friend\" in hers... hehe)  As mentioned, breakfast/brunch hours there was a long wait. About 25 minutes, so my friend and I took a stroll to the bakery down the street. After our stroll back, it was about our turn. We were seated at the first available spot, the bar. I typically avoid bar service because a. I cannot people watch, b. the seats are not so comfy, and c. it is hard to converse with the person you're with. Alas, I gave in because of hunger and said please, seat us anywhere.   Service was great. Typically you would think bar service when it is so busy isn't so great. Our guy was friendly, prompt and attentive. Our food came out within a very reasonable time of order. I was very satisfied.  Food- I ordered the Booker T which is sweet potato home fries with 2 eggs with local pork sausage cooked and placed atop of it with a homemade biscuit. Portion size was good, especially it being local eggs and pork. Overall flavor, I enjoyed the sweet potato home fries, my only gripe would be while seasoned well, I wish they were cooked a little bit more so they had a little bit more texture. It was just mushy, not even a little bit of crunchy caramelization of the sweet potato. The egg sausage was cooked to my liking. I like them JUST done, as in still soft and fluffy, but not wet. This was a godsend to my picky way of how I like my eggs cooked. My friend got essentially the breakfast salad with bacon, an overeasy egg and biscuit. The bacon was perfectly crisp, not greasy, and the greens very fresh. We were both very happy with our choices. We both had leftovers. For me, that is unusual. So that shows how filling the Booker T was.  Overall, if I visit Charlotte again, I'd go back to Zada Jane's if I was looking for not your typical brunch fair. I did not find pricing to be really overpriced. Besides, if the food is good I take no issue with paying a little bit extra. Also, the fact that they use local ingredients is always a plus to me.",

    "text": "After reading the reviews saying not to go on a Sunday morning because it would be mobbed, a friend and I decided to brave it anyway. Thanks to everyone who posted saying parking was a bitch; we parked in the little shopping mall .2 miles from the restaurant and strolled down because it was such a gorgeous morning.   WAIT: The place was, in fact, mobbed. We were told a 25-30 minute wait before we'd be seated if we didn't have a preference as to in or out doors. We didn't, and it was a gorgeous day, so we walked down the street to get a couple lattes before being seated.   SERVICE: Everyone seems to say that the service is slow, grouchy, and elitist, and I can definitely see whereas it may be the case. However, we lucked out by getting a seat at the bar. Funky people to talk to, and the guy servicing it was helpful, attentive, and rather funny to talk to. In the end, I'm glad that we ended up sitting at the bar instead of outside. Also, we received our food within 10-15 minutes of ordering, and he took our drink order right when we sat, then our regular order 5 minutes later. And keep in mind, this is still with a full house and people piling out the door.   FOOD: I'm not quite sure what it is, but their grapefruit juice is outta this world. I need to know what brand they use, because I want to buy it. My friend ended up getting the Booker T., and this was my first experience with sweet potato fries. DAMN were they good. The egg with cheese and sausage in it was also tasty but the sweet potato fries just were amazing taste-wise.  I was feeling something light, and ended up with the breakfast salad. They forgot to put the bacon on the salad which was fine because they brought it out on the side instead, which I preferred. The bacon, by the way, was absolutely outstanding. As a bacon connoisseur, I feel okay admitting that. The greens were the kind of organic mesclun mix that I was used to eating in Maine, and it kind of made me ache of home. The potatoes were good, but I was still envious of my friend's sweet potato home fries. Biscuit with the egg on top to finish was also great. I know people have complained about portion size on here, but we both ended up bringing the rest of ours home and making a second meal out of it, so no complaints over here.  PRICE: Some things were a bit pricy, but as a person who worked in an organic food store, I know what they're probably paying for the produce and protein. The prices being a bit high are understandable if you know how pricy organic stuff can be. I'm not a stuffy organic know-it-all by any means, but having eaten and grown stuff like that and getting used to it, you don't mind throwing down a little extra coin for quality and nostalgia.   Bottom line: Bar = better/faster service Sweet potato fries = absolutely amazing If you like to eat organic and free range, price = not bad at all",

Breakfast is great, and I also enjoy getting lunch from here. The hummus is homemade and spectacular, and I like the wide range of teas to choose from. There are tons of vegetarian options, which makes me happy (if a bit overwhelmed with all the things I can choose from. I get used to finding the one veggie possibility and ordering that one, so when there are so many choices, I'm sometimes flabbergasted.)  The atmosphere is bright and interesting, and the servers are really friendly.",

Upon waiting, I realized just how packed the place really was, and that was only outside! We stood and waited for almost a half hour before we found a seat.... that is, a seat to wait even longer. Regardless, we finally got a table inside (which was even more packed than outside was) and yay! It was a booth!  My friends and I ordered a round of momosa's (yes, they ID'd us) and looked over the menu. Zada Janes has a great food selection, though I couldn't seem to find the drink selections, but I was excited to try their food! I've heard many great things about their food and was not at all disappointed. I had the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich with a side of potato spuds and devoured the entire thing! The wait staff was friendly and fairly prompt while serving the drinks and food. $5 dollar momosa's on Sundays, by the way.  Overall, I loved the place. Very unique with a lot of personality, but it seems to be busy the majority of the week and that can downplay the atmosphere a bit. Also, we were seated in a booth with a draft, so we were pretty cold the entire time, but that wasn't at all the Cafe's fault.   I LOVED Zada Janes and will definitely go back as soon as I get a chance. YAY!",

I ordered the free-range chicken thinking maybe I should order something else since we make that at home fairly regularly. It's served with mashed potatoes and green bean casserole. I was pleasantly surprised, and reminded that I need cooking lessons, when every bite demanded the full attention of my tastebuds- YUM! My husband enjoyed his shrimp and grits and we both want to return. We've heard about big crowds and long waits here but seeing as though we arrived early, we experienced none of that. I did notice it had begun to pick up by the time we were leaving though.   I was impressed that Zada Jane's is entirely non-smoking. Besides the obvious health benefits to all and kindness to children who might otherwise be subjected to second hand smoke, I think the quality of their food also deserves to be fully tasted.  Excellent area to spend a few hours and walk around before or after dining.",

I was famished. I was delighted that we didn't have to wait for a table. I was not delighted that I had to move my vehicle from the Grease place across the street (they tow) and that Zada's didn't come with a whole lot of parking options (spaces, that is). However, after I was properly parked and coffeed up... I ordered the Basic Breakfast with pork sausage, scrambled eggs, grits (very very creamy) and the biscuit. Being a biscuit maker myself--I wasn't excited about THEIR biscuit, but it wasn't bad. Others at the table ordered the pancakes (DELICIOUS, I was sad I didn't order these but I did offer to finish off my friends--who let me, yay), the sweet potato hashbrowns (good, but SWEET--you have been warned), and the Bunny Rancheros (colorful, looked and smelled good, I didn't taste these but he seemed to enjoy his meal as his plate was clean afterwards...  I will definitely go back and try other things from the menu--especially some of their sandwiches and OF COURSE the pancakes!

There were at least 3 different people (I think) coming to our table. I LOVE people watching so the area definitely served that purpose.

I felt it was missing something. I've been to some good Greek restaurants and I can taste the difference. The patties needed a little flavor.   I had the Huevos Rancheros and that was pretty good. It would have been better if they gave me like 3 or 4 tortillas; as it was A LOT of food and two just wasn't gettin' it. I think they folded them and put it on my plate for presentation. They could have just wrapped it up in some foil and put it on the side.   The 4 Layer Chocolate Cake was decadent. It was fresh, as I was told they order this from another bakery daily or every other day. Would have been nice to have a dollop of some vanilla ice cream on the side.   Other than that, the service was decent. It dwindled down a bit when others came. No refills to the water when we really needed it after the cake came (since there was no ice cream to wash it down with... yes... wash it down). Also, I don't think I'm going to have people box my food anymore. She came out with the cake and left me wondering where my food was. I think after it comes out, I like to keep it in my sight.   All in all, a decent joint.",

Hostess was very rude to us and then tried to sit us at a table that wasn't even wiped down yet. The only good thing was that we got coffee while waiting. Unless you have all day, enjoy being hungry for much longer than expected, and like being treated rudely by employers than this is the place for you. We were treated like an inconvenience and I was told \"I'm not trying to be an asshole but you'd be better off inside.\"  The only saving grace was our waitress who was very apologetic for the behavior of her peers and the food was good. But did not make up for the unpleasantness of the seating. Our party ended up being split and half of us had a great server named Courtney and then the other half were treated so poorly by a waiter who refused to split the checks.",

The only downside is that the limited seating makes for long waits. I don't bother coming here on weekends.   My usual order is the Bunny Rancheros: potatoes, black beans, & chicken under Eggs. Served with queso, salsa verde, guac, sour cream, and warm tortillas. I promise it tastes better than it sounds! You have to just try it.   The servers are friendly and as attentive as they can be on busy days. The coffee (served in mismatched random coffee mugs) is always refilled before I hit the bottom of the mug...and that's all I ask for!",

It was a bit chilly out and since I already was cold, we asked to sit inside. There was a larger table open but they still gave it to just us. Our server was friendly and on top of things, asking if our meal was okay after it arrived, refilled our coffees without hesitation; however, not being there ever before I was not familiar with how to order. He asked \"what carb I would like,\" and I was caught off guard and he repeated the question and then asked, \"what carbohydrate would you like?\" I know what carb means but it just caught me off guard since I have never been there before.. The food took a long time to come out and after trying our dishes were were underwhelmed. I ordered 'The Belvedere' under The Merry Yolker Tres Huevo Omelets and my boyfriend ordered 'Booker T's East Side Hasher' under Specialty Plates. I will admit the portions are fairly large and could definitely be shared between two people. My meal was very oily to be an omelet, had way to much garlic bits inside, and the goat cheese was on only a quarter of the omelet - which was the end I couldn't even finish. My boyfriend's meal had way too much cheese on the meal it overpowered the eggs, protein, and sweet potatoes. The biscuits were okay, very hard on the top; so I just ate the inside. I don't believe we will be going back.",

When she brought it to me she told me that they were out of almond flavoring and she just substituted it for hazelnut. I would have preferred her to ask for my second choice considering I do not like hazelnut. There was also not creamer or sugar at our table. It was an hour before our food was ready, and people who came after us got their food before us. There are much better cafes/ brunch places in the area. I highly recommend to eat elsewhere and save your money.",

The food isn't really special. My service was sub par, as I made special request and after looking annoyed, the bartender (an older lady) told me that if it weren't Sunday, they would be able to do it, but it was just too busy. However what I was asking for just would've required the chef to substitute tofu for potatoes.... I just got potatoes on the side and mixed everything together on my own. Whatever. It was comical how she was Not trying to hear it. She didn't have an attitude, just wasn't up for going out of her way. It also took a LONG time for our food to come out. Another person at the bar was visibly irritated. I had a mimosa, which was champagne with a splash of orange juice. We watched her make it, literally a splash. Just enough to turn the drink orange. No complaints from me. At $5, GREAT!",

My husband daughter and I went for breakfast a few months ago and we're the first to sit on the patio, as it filled up everyone got their food before us, still no food, my husband asked for more coffee, the waitress walked in and out of the door completely disregarding his request, still no food, the waitress walked out of the door for the third time with a bowl of water for a dog.... still no food or coffee. At this point we got up and left, hungry of course and went to the drive thru at mcdonalds.   Last week, again first on the patio, with a friend this time who also says she's never had good service here and lives a block away. Again we were last to get our food, we ordered some sandwiches and we're at the restaurant for over an hour and half!!!!    The reason I won't come back, the nachos which I've always loved were sooo stale and the veggie burger which has always been my favorite was god awful with no flavor.   So save your time and money. Go to krazy fish or three amigos or even five guys across the street!!! You've got a lot of choice in this area.",

Everything was brought out save the biscuit, which would be out of the oven soon, I was told. The hash browns were really fried chunks of sweet potato, not quote the expected. By the time the biscuit came, the gravy was cold, and they offered to bring a new cup of gravy. By the time they did that, the biscuit was cold. Very unfortunate, since they were tasty enough.  Second time, I came for dinner. The entree prices were shockingly high, so I never got to try one. I went with a sandwich instead, which was affordable and good, but somewhat bland.

No amount of free range this, organic that, or veggie whazzat can make up for a lack of smiles, apparent disorganization and just plain coldness. SMILE and you disarm me.

But for gog's sake, don't look like you *know* it's falling apart around you. I'll wonder if the food is safe!  Pity... This place has a lot of potential. They need to figure out that when they are full, the game is turning tables efficiently. Believe me, many people in the place wanted to get in and out faster than the help wanted them to. We heard some of them talking about it. (\"Where's our food? I need another drink. Damn, they're slow!)  Service can be attentive without being smothering. I guess what I'm saying is, make me feel appreciated, welcome, pampered, and *served* and I won't feel so taken by the high price. Don't make me wait for the check.

Its sad really considering that the food is so delicious. I went in today and ordered the french toast with non-crispy bacon(i order my bacon like this every time i go in and its never a problem). My food came out with extra crispy bacon. I informed the server and she thought I wanted it crispy (not a problem since we all make mistakes). It became a problem when she came back out 30 seconds later with another plate of crispy bacon informing me that the batch of bacon was  just a crispy batch and that all the bacon there was cooked like that. I thought this was ridiculous that she would bring out more crispy bacon since I clearly was not happy with crispy bacon in the first place. I informed her that i come in all the time and ask for my bacon the same way and it has never been a problem before. I then asked her if they could just cook me some bacon that was not crispy. She said she could ask the cook and that it would take a few minutes. I was ok with waiting as I was not in a rush and knew that it ALWAYS takes FOREVER to get food there. About 2 minutes later a man brings out a plate of RAW bacon thats slightly warm. I was really annoyed by this but instead of sending it back a THIRD i just chalked it up as a lost and realized that these people could care less whether I left there as a satisfied customer or not. It really upsets me because I  am a server and i would think that people who work in the service industry would always do there best to make sure people leave happy. I guess I'll just have to learn how to make that delicious french toast myself as I will not be spending anymore of my hard earned money in this establishment.  **Not every experience I've had here has been bad. There's a curly-haired bartender there that is ALWAYS great**",

I ordered \"the gobbler\" sandwich with a side of roasted potatoes. The bread on the sandwich was stale and really dry. Super terrible. But even worse were the roasted potatoes. They were, without a doubt, cooked one day, refrigerated and microwaved when ordered. They had a dry, bouncy sponge texture. Really terrible. The passionfruit tea was delicious though. And the service was not bad either. But I will not go back and will not recommend.",

About a 50 min wait to eat outside.SO And I had the south no north or whatever the name was--- peppers, Caramelized onions, ham omelette with a biscuit and sweet potato side. Definitely 10/10. The sweet potatoes were especially divine. Large portions and felt the price was reasonable. Our vegan friends were happy that they had several options on the menu and enjoyed a tofu curry dish. Took off a star for the horrific service. Waiter was friendly but was manning far too many tables. There needed to be more staff to deal with the huge crowd of customers.",

Having only been for breakfast, I always get the Booker T with rye bread.  I need to ask them where they get their bread - it is divine.  I am not a biscuit person but if I was I am sure these are great.  The mimosa is served for $11 bucks - covers an entire bottle of champagne and a pitcher of OJ.  YUM!  Super campy inside with local artists work, junk store finds and fun memorabilia.    There is free coffee while you wait (or other special coffee drinks at the coffee bar! probably not free).  Just be patient - what you get it worth the price and worth the wait.",

Recently had a guest in town and we dropped in to have a late lunch. What a mistake!  We both ordered the breakfast salad. And were pretty appalled.   It was literally a bed of dry greens dumped on a plate with cold potato hash browns on top that appeared to have been sitting around  all day.  To boot the egg on top was cooked, but tepid.  The dressing on the side was totally misbalanced in flavor to the point where I was making the sour lemon pucker face.  I realize we went at an off time, but that is NO excuse.  The server was pleasant but not terribly good, and was also in heavy-duty sidework mode - buzzing around the place cleaning and stocking and vacuuming.   If you're going to incorporate cleaning during slower eating hours, do it one section at a time and while people are not sitting in that section.  Again, I love the location and the funky appeal of Zada's, and maybe this was just an off day and time, but I'm not inclined to go back any time soon with so many other options around town.",

Zada Janes likes to think of itself as a trendy organic breakfast place, in the vein of Asheville's Sunny Point Cafe or Early Girl.  But unfortunately it is a poor imitation of those places. The food is always mediocre at best and the service is constantly pretty awful.  The last time I tried eating there, I was with a friend's family of 5 on a weekday around 10, hardly peak hours.  The first food all came out over an hour after we ordered.  The rest all showed up in spurts.  The two adults first, followed by their kids meals 5 minutes or so later, followed by my own food 10 minutes later, followed by two sides of bacon in the initial order that didn't make it until 30 minutes later.  The food isn't memorable; it's standard breakfast fair a notch better than a diner.  Have brunch at Bistro La Bon and avoid this place entirely.",

I only know her name because I had to ask another server. Then, they forgot one of our cocktail for our table and only when she came to take our order said \"oh they didn't bring it? Huh... Well what do you want to eat?\"  Being vegetarian, I asked if I could swap the chicken on my dish for guacamole (which is cheaper than chicken on their menu) to which she dismissively said \"no\" without even asking or trying to accommodate. She actually never came back (someone else brought our food) and no one ever came back to check on us (no refills, nothing) we had to flag down a totally different server after 15 minutes of finishing our food to ask for our check (Alexandra, who to be fair, was quite pleasant)  It was our first time but will certainly be our last.",

    "text": "I have visited Zada many times when I lived close to the neighborhood.  The breakfast was always spot on especially the Bunny Rancheros which was great even as a to go order.  Honestly one of the best breakfast dishes in Charlotte.   I moved away a few years ago and I convinced my spouse, who has never been, that the waking up early and drive to Zada to beat the crowd would be worth the effort.  We got there at the crack of open for our visit because there were many other days we drove by and he said, \"it's too crowded\".  We were one of the first seated so I'm glad.  We were ignored. Embarrassingly a while ignored.  Enough where we got to witness a couple sat well after us arguing about why this place was a \"hot spot\".  Thankfully we were finally approached and gave both drink and food order because we weren't sure if we would have another opportunity. I ordered the special that I swear was pork belly on biscuits and my husband ordered the Bunny Rancheros because I have talked about it for years.  18 minutes later my husband got his food and we got our drinks. We started eating his breakfast because, well damn, we were hungry.   Our server finally came back and I was told,\"sorry, we don't have biscuits. would you like something else?\".  Honestly?  Erase it from your special board before you open.  As we were still sitting we heard an employee possible manager say the biscuits were burned throw them out and fire another. Then our server came out and asked after we ate the Rancheros if I would still like my biscuit pork belly order.   I understand bad days.  I understand burnt biscuits.  I loved Zada so much I convinced someone who had never been to get there the moment they opened.   It was honestly the most awkward introduction to a restaurant recommendation and one of the most memorable never coming back experiences ever.",

Ordered a latte which took about 15 minutes til it got to the table, next time I'll stick to black coffee for simplicity. I was really craving some coffee and was bummed with the wait. Ordered the Belvedere omelette with herb potatoes, a biscuit and a side of well done bacon. There were 5 of in our party so not sure if that caused the wait, but it was at least 20 minutes from ordering to plates on the table. We were all soooo hungry and very happy to see our breakfast! The omelette was really good, very goat cheesy (which I like) and the potatoes were awesome. Biscuits are buttery and my bacon came out normal (not well done) but it was at least crunchy so all was good.  Overall I liked this place and would return but will try different timing so the wait for food isn't too bad. Prices not horrible, but not cheap.

The menu was simple but offered just enough variety. We chose the \"Zada janes favorite\" nachos and the Mecklenburger with roasted potatoes.  Loved it all! Nachos were pilled high with lots of flavorful veggies and chicken.  The burger was tasty and potatoes were perfectly crispy on the outside.  Our bill was reasonable at under $25, service was good and the decor was entertaining.  We will return soon to try some of the other menu items that look good.    The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is a strange sour odor from the time we walked in. I have a sensitive nose but that was really strong!

The pancakes tasted like someone had contaminated the batter and it had an aftertaste of something with garlic or some other non-sweet spice and my grits had a slightly burnt aftertaste.  I'm not sure WTH happened in the Zada Jane's kitchen today, but it definitely didn't work for my taste buds. I'd been craving ZJ's for hours today and in the end it was a totally bust.   Sorry, ZJ's - but today, you really let me down.",

The Green Mindmelt Panini was very good as well.   The service was friendly. We didn't feel rushed so we were able to enjoy the evening, no pressure.  Zada Jane's is a quirky cafe which gives the impression that it is a casual and moderately priced place; however, they have some high priced entrees on the menu. The fancy entrees feel misplaced here. I think that if I want to spend a lot on a steak, I would go elsewhere for the environment.",

    "text": "The sheer number of reviews for Zada Jane's was enough to tempt me to purchase an online deal and venture into Charlotte for some good grub. It proved to be worth the trip as it proved to be a really excellent meal.   The parking was a little tight, and would have been harder to figure out had it been busier. We arrived at 6pm on a Saturday and the place was a ghost town, which suited us just fine. We got a prime people-watching spot on the patio area and it proved to make for an entertaining meal. The service was well-paced the the hipster waitstaff crew were attentive and friendly.  The beer selection is composed mostly of bottles, but they consisted of different microbrews which was a plus. After ordering our brews we got a basket of Kool Kip's Nachos...vegeterian style ($7.25) , for an appetizer. Despite the absence of meat, these were some of the best nachos I've ever had, and that says a lot. The roasted squash, peppers, onions and corn, topped with black beans, guac, and sour cream proved to be quite the hearty starter. The blue chips also made a for a solid mode of transportation for the nacho toppings. I would highly recommend going with a plate of nachos if you are grabbing a meal here.  For dinner I had the Braised Short Ribs ($19.95) and it was out of this world. Now I've been disappointed with dry, grizzly short ribs in the past, but that was not an issue at Zada Janes. These suckers were succulent, tender and delicious, and the portion was mind-boggling. I, Rob B, was only able to eat half the meal and took the other half home for a tastetacular leftover lunch the following day. These mighty short ribs came with these amazing mashed potatoes and cole slaw. Combining a bite of meat, potato and slaw proved to be pure excellence.   The missus ordered the Wild Mushroom Ravioli ($15) which she really enjoyed. I wouldn't touch those 'shrums myself but she gobbled them down. Her portion was also a bit much and had plenty of leftovers for the following day. The only downside was that the mushrooms were just too oily and rich...someone in the kitchen had a heavy hand with the oil. Hers came with a side salad which was really good for a side salad, with high-quality veggies. She went with the lemon thyme dressing and that was really a winner. If you get a salad here, give that dressing a whirl.  With all these good eats we simply had no room for dessert, despite how much we wanted to give it a whirl. Zada Jane's proved to be a really good restaurant and we'll definitely be back in the future, without the online deal.",

I have no problem paying for something but don't be a wise ass and try to steal from people.

We talked very highly of Zada to our friends and decided to take them there for brunch two Sunday's ago. Ugh not a good idea.   Zada must of had an off day, because my friend ordered a mushroom Swiss spinach bacon omelet and the server didn't tell us they were out of spinach and mushrooms till she brought the food out. Um hello?! Since the omelet didn't have veggies she essentially got a half pig in her omelet. We had the remake the Omelet and go lighter on the bacon which took 15 minutes. Meantime everyone else sat while their food got cold and my chicken sandwich was over cooked which was disappointing. Anyways, when the check came the server said she removed the cost of the spinach and that's all. Well I hope you would.......  We always have had a good experience here, but it was embarrassing brining friends and it being bad, but don't worry I'll be back!!!   Recommendation: don't wait till 1:30/2 to go to brunch ;)",

I can't remember what I got or what it cost, but I remember that I hated it! So when  I went for brunch for the first time, I was hesitant. I am happy to report that I was wrong in my hesitancy!  I have only ever gotten the bunny rancheros with half chorizo and half chicken or the pancakes. I love, love, love it! My boyfriend loves the vegless avenger omelette and has never ordered anything else. On Sunday (and Tuesday, I think), wine is half off so we always get a bottle of champagne and orange juice to make mimosas.   There can be a long wait but it's always worth it.

Service was a little slow for my liking but our server warned us that they are understaffed for the day, can't hold it against them. We both had omelettes and both had he same reaction - not really what we anticipated for an \"omelette\" as the toppings are basically on top of (slightly overdone) eggs instead of mixed in as I would expect. Coffee and potatoes were great. If we come back I'd try something other than an omelette but would definitely give the place another try. Cute atmosphere.",

    "text": "I'd like to start this review off by saying that in no way was my bad experience a reflection of the server.   My boyfriend and I came here on Sunday 11/19/2017 at 1pm.  This was our first visit. I called earlier in the morning to ask if they used latex gloves (I am deathly allergic) the woman answering the phone said they only used nitrile and they can't use latex because she was allergic. I replied thank God! Which, I hope she understand i was thanking God they didn't use latex not for her allergy. It's hard for me to find local places that don't use latex. So i was excited to add Zada Jane's to my list...  We walked passed a busy patio (with two empty tables) and walked into the restaurant to be greeted by a woman who instructed us to sit anywhere we liked. She then grabbed menus and asked if we wanted to sit inside or out. We choose inside because we saw two two-top tables open right away. She walked us to one of the two tops (third from the window) which was dirty. Which doesn't bother me. I understand things get busy. She, paused and said let me clean it for you, turned around and noticed the booth behind her was clean and that we could sit there. This was the second booth from the kitchen. We took that one because we weren't picky and didn't want to make her clean off a table. We were greeted promptly by our server, I wish I would have gotten her name. She got us water and mimosas. We ordered after that, build your own omelette and a side of bacon. We waited about 40 minutes for our food which is understandable for a busy place. During our wait a young woman (slim, with short hair) with four dirty cups stacked in her hand stopped by our table and asked who sat us at this table. Confused, I looked at her said said a woman at the front. She asked if our name was on the list. Still confused because we weren't informed there was a list or a wait, i said no, when we walked in a lady told us to sit anywhere we liked. She asked me again who it was. I told her I had no idea. Which i didn't because  she wasn't our server or the woman behind the bar and I hadn't seen her since. The woman put the dirty cups on our table, spilling the water and then with an attitude stated \"i need to know who because someone did that earlier and fucked up everything for us.\" Walked away and came back to clean up the water she spilled and apologized for spilling it. At this point me and my boyfriend realized they must have been on a long wait. I honestly hope this woman wasn't the manager because I couldn't imagine a Manager speaking to customers like that or placing blame on us for something that had to do with the staff. We personally felt like that was a conversation we didn't need to be included in. And more so we didn't appreciate being accused of skipping a line we had no knowledge of. Both me and my boyfriend are bartenders/servers and would have been more than happy to sit at the bar or wait for a table. But we decided not to make a fuss about it. Our server asked if we wanted another round of mimosas and I told her we would wait for our food. A gentleman stopped by and dropped off our omelettes and explained that the side of bacon I ordered was in the oven and would be out shortly. We got another round of drinks and informed our server that my boyfriends omelette was missing the tomatoes and mushrooms from his omelette. Which wasn't the end of the world--we just didn't want to be charged for it. After we finished our omelettes and drinks the bacon, EXTRA crispy and greasy came out. The gentleman from before dropped it and apologized for the wait. I choose not to eat it and asked for the check. We didn't tell the server that the bacon was near burnt because we honestly just wanted to leave. So we paid for the $3.10 bacon that we didn't eat or get with our meal. As a server I understand food being wrong, going out late, kitchen having an off day, being maybe short staffed, busy on a Sunday for brunch and anything that may come with a bad experience. By no way did we take this out on our server. She was great. And I have had plenty of bad experiences at restaurants but have never wrote a bad review. The events I've described didn't make me write this review. The woman who stopped by our table and confronted us about something we had no control of did. Not because she stopped by the table but because when my boyfriend walked out of the restaurant she rolled her eyes at him in disgust. In all honesty the unprofessionalism this young woman displayed was horrible. None of her problems were our fault. And the only reason i didn't walk back into restaurant and ask to speak to a manager was because I wasn't completely sure she wasn't a manager. The service was great. The food was good even with the missing items. I'm sure on another day the bacon will be great. But the woman who cussed while speaking to us and rolled her eyes as we left is the entire reason we won't patron this place again.",

The space is tiny, so expect a wait, especially for weekend brunch, but they move through the list quickly and it's better during the summer since their space is essentially doubled by their patio.  Coffee: OMG their holiday mocha... has gingerbread and peppermint in there with the mocha and espresso. Just do it. No regrets.  Food: I order the Booker T's East Side Hasher pretty much every time. Sweet potato has browns, scrambled eggs, and smothered in cheese. Yes, yes, yes. Biscuit on the side is a bit dry for my taste, but I'm always so full from the rest of the meal that it doesn't matter. The meal is large, come hungry, or plan to share.  Service: Very kind servers and good at what they do. I've never had an order messed up or someone fail to refill my water.",

There is original artwork covering the yellow walls (most is available for purchase), the front entry is papered with flyers advertising the goings on in CLT, and the waitstaff are all funky, friendly and fun. Ask for Steven who is knowledgeable, super attentive and warm.  The food is good too! They serve breakfast all day so its all I have ever ordered. The bacon is delicious and always cooked perfectly. They also have plenty of vegetarian and vegan options. I highly recommend the East-Western, a curry infused scrambled tofu dish with peas, mushrooms, spinach, and onions. Incredibly flavorful. As for sides, the sweet potatoes are delicious, spiced with cinnamon, maple syrup, and other goodness!   Zada Jane's has an awesome outdoor patio where you can often see people drinking mimosas or Bloody Mary's with their dog leashed next to them.  The only reason I gave Zada Jane's four stars instead of five is that the food can be a bit inconsistent. I have eaten there many times and some days the food is better than others. What keeps me coming back is the ambience and service. My boyfriend and I can spend three hours here on a weekend morning, and even if its busy they never rush you to leave.",

Apparently this place is always packed, but when we walked in the place was pretty empty. #win.   We were greeted immediately and got our drinks.I'd checked out the YELP reviews and checked out the menu so I knew what I wanted to get- Blazing Saddles omelet with home fries. I opted for egg whites and the salsa and sour cream on the side.   Cue the waiting music.....  We seriously waited and waited for our food. At one point, I asked our waitress if the order was even going to come out. She said she's check on it but we still waited.   FINALLY.....the food arrived. That goodness it was hot. I was hungry enough to eat my fist I couldn't bear the thought of having to send the whole thing back. The food was fine, nothing to brag about. I could have used a bit more chipotle seasoning on the chicken but otherwise it was just....fine.   If my friends want to go back here again, I'd go but I'm not adding it to my brunch rotation.   Oh...just a head's up....parking is a nightmare. You're welcome! :)",

    "text": "We were in town visiting for a week and this was the worst breakfast we've ever had.    Service - Yelp let us down; don't trust the large amount of reviews for this place.  We were ignored when we walked in - one lady was taking a phone order, another lady looked at us but then walked away to enter an order into the computer, lastly the guy was too busy telling a story with other customers to stop and greet us.  We were unsure what the process was, there wasn't a sign saying \"Wait to be seated\" or a host station so we decided to just grab a seat and wait.  Keep in mind that there was 3 people working and 3 tables of customers in the building - 1 to 1 should be easy to manage.  The employees seemed to be having a better time joking with each other and telling stories than to help us.   Food - We ended up getting simple omelettes. When they arrived the eggs were overcooked and the meat inside was extremely overcooked.  The crumbled sausage was burnt so bad that it was black.  The plate was coated in grease from cooking.  By far it was the most disgusting meal we've ever received in.  The food was dropped off at our table by the person cooking it which shows that there is no quality check process is place.  Food was uneatable and service was unwelcoming.  1 star is being generous.  Don't waste your money on a business that doesn't appreciate the customer.",

We came in this morning when we had off work (thinking it would be a little quieter than a weekend) and sure enough we got sat right away. We put in our order and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. For about an hour. Everyone who was sat after us had their food and finally the waitress came to tell us that there had been an error with the computer and our ticket was never put in. Not ideal- but mistakes happen so we continued waiting. And waiting. And waiting. At this point we'd been there for at least an hour and a half, and it had been 30 minutes since we were made aware of the mistake. We told the waitress we were going to head out and she asked if she could go check on the food to see if it was almost ready. 5 minutes later she came back and said it was about 3 tickets behind. When they realized they never put in our order they didn't even move it to the front of the line??? I can assure you that the food CANNOT overcome service that is THIS terrible.   There are plenty of brunch places in Charlotte with awesome food where they will actually treat you like a paying customer. Go to one of those.",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to one of our favorite neighborhoods in Charlotte, Plaza Midwood, and to Zada Jane's Corner Cafe. This beachfront themed cafe advertises a menu that is half vegetarian and half meat. Although breakfast is their focus and served all day, their lunch menu includes sandwiches, salads, and many unique sides, and their dinner menu is full of delicious options.  Dora here. This place has been on our list since we visited The Workman's Friend directly across the street and gawked at the crowded patio. Today was no different. The place was jammed with a thirty-minute wait. Service was friendly and attentive and more than welcoming, even if we were among the oldest ones there.  For my lunch, I chose the South of NO North omelet, which included country ham, caramelized onions, green chilies, cheddar cheese and covered with homemade salsa and served with a side of stone ground grits and a homemade TLC biscuit. This omelet was great and worked together perfectly with the onions and chilies to bring this dish to the next level. The salsa added a little heat, and when combined with the grits, made a wonderful bite.  Dora here. The Vegless Avenger, an omelet packed with meats (bacon, country ham, turkey sausage, chipotle chicken and chorizo) along with a healthy dose of cheddar cheese popped with flavor. The egg was light yet held up to all five meats. Typically I'm not a meat-lover when it comes to omelets or pizzas, but the chipotle chicken and chorizo combination intrigued me. One bite led to two and three, and don't you know I ate that whole thing! And the biscuit with apple butter, oh my goodness! I'm trying to cut back on all these carbs, but that biscuit made it tough. The sweet potato hash didn't do much for me. Probably because I prefer my sweet taters loaded with butter and brown sugar. lol.  Still Dora. Fair warning. The inside of Zada Jane's is extremely LOUD. Don't go there expecting to enjoy a quiet morning coffee. Not gonna happen. Not even outside. lol. Also, for parking, they have a small lot behind the restaurant, but don't bother. There's ample parking in a lot kitty corner across the street. You can thank us later. What's your favorite omelet?  We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

    "text": "Mediocre food and poor service (except the lady with the dreads - she is fabulous). First time I talked to the server about my celiac and he served me burned sweet potato hash with cheese that apparently had gluten. Second time I got some other mediocre food I can't even remember and the last time I got a mediocre latte from a brown haired woman who seemed annoyed that I couldn't have gluten and was much less friendly after I told her. She also seemed annoyed that we were sitting at the bar drinking coffee and only one of us was getting food (not me because I knew I couldn't trust her to put an order in with her attitude and my first experience at the place). Sorry to inconvenience you? Additionally, the place just seems dirty like they wouldn't do great on a health inspection. It's a bummer because it could be great if the staff wasn't so lame.",

This was my first time to Zada Jane's because the patio is always packed, so I assumed there was a long wait. Our party of hour only waited about 20 minutes though.   I got the Bunny Rancheros with the Chipotle Chicken, and would do it again. There was a healthy helping of both home fries and black beans and the cool guacamole was a good contrast to the heat of the rest of the dish.   I only ordered coffee, but I did try my fiance's chai latte, which was to die for.  The atmosphere was cool. A lot of local art, memorabilia and knick-knacks.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to brunch at Zada Jane's on a Thursday about 10am after hearing from great things from locals. However, after poor service, incredibly slow responses in every department and very lack luster food, I couldn't see myself ever returning.  My visit was mid-morning on a Thursday and the disorganization started when my group of six walked in. Do you wait for a table or seat yourself? I'd recommend at least checking in before sitting, especially if you want to sit on the patio. I placed an order for a TLC biscuit with a fried, runny egg, cheddar cheese and apple maple bacon. I was wit a party of six people and we waited 45 minutes for our food. During this time our waiter never checked on us, let us know when our food would be out or apologized/explained the long wait. When the food finally did arrive, it was not delivered together, there was a fifteen minute gap between meals arriving, with my simple biscuit arriving last. Two of our orders were incorrect, including mine where the fried egg was completed cooked through with a broken yoke and cheese was missing from my meal. After having them re-do my meal they biscuit arrived back with one tiny slice of bacon, way too much cheese and the actual biscuit was very sub-par. I would have blown it off as a simple kitchen mistake, but everything about Zada Jane's screamed \"problem\": from the food, to the slow service and waits to the waiter himself.  As a regular restaurant patron, I am paying for a meal and an experience that I cannot replicate at home. I would highly discourage anyone thinking of visiting Zada Jane's to save yourself from a disappointing experience.",

Their TLC biscuits are incredible--slightly crunchy on the outside, pillowy and airy on the inside, and when you break it open and see all the steam pouring out, you want to throw the whole thing in your mouth. I usually top mine with the herb gravy with soysage, which is phenomenal.   I've also been there for dinner and had no complaints about their mushroom ravioli. It was fresh, flavorful, filling, and left me wanting more--just like any good meal should.  If you're in the Charlotte area, please go to Plaza Midwood and check this place out. You may have to wait a few moments to get in, but it's definitely worth it.",

Well somehow Tuesday morning at 8AM isn't the busiest time for them so I got to sit down right away and have their version of huevos rancheros.   I can tell you it wasn't huevos rancheros per se, but it was pretty tasty so I don't mind them taking liberties to a point. It's a large portion though so I hope you like beans and a real runny poached egg cause you're gonna get a lot of them.",

The interior is taken up by a large kitchen space in the middle.   The service was friendly and we were seated quickly.  The menu was interesting. Nothing on the menu really appealed to me which was surprising. Either it was salads and sandwiches or $20 entrees. It was a strange mix. I ended up with a salad and a chicken and apple quesadilla. The quesadilla was really good. The salad was pretty standard but had a lot of stuff in it. And the salads are big.  My friend got a chicken sandwich and she didn't really care for the chicken. My friend ended up with food poisoning later that night and was sick all night long. I can't say it was from here, but this was the last place we ate.  At one point they ran out of unsweetened iced tea and the server was really apologetic and didn't charge me. I had already had two glasses and thought that was nice of her.   Overall, this place has potential but just missed the mark for me.",

My birthday, the kitchen was on wait and had to wait an hour and a half for my food and had to get it to go which was a bummer. Last time I waited 15 mins get a drink order without even a \"yo be right with you\" and an hour since being seated for food. In no way do I feel this is the server's fault but probably a under staffing/space issue. I really hope they find a way to fix it so I can continue to come in when I have time I should probably mention I'm also not coming in on weekends or anything crazy so I kind of get a feeling it's a perpetual thing. I'm happy they're busy and successful. I love their courtyard area and that they allow dogs on it-I just wished it was a place that I could get in/out of in an hour.",

    "text": "Had my sis, who is a local resident, take Mom, my nephew, and me here for our last meal in Charlotte on 4/28.  Sis has never eaten here and was surprised that such a place existed.    Nice atmosphere.  Slow and impatient service (and I didn't even barrage her w/ questions like I normally do), with perhaps 1/8, or less, of restaurant capacity.  Food was good though, and they were as follows:  Mom and sis shared w/ nephew- Bunny Rancheros ($8.95): <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aBLx9JlAMq_AuW6VAImSwg?select=0QyTXrou9KTH477vIOxaWg#0QyTXrou9KTH477vIOxaWg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/aBLx...</a>  A pic of my nephew's side of pancakes <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aBLx9JlAMq_AuW6VAImSwg?select=WaeabUhvm3nHqN9G4nLH8A#WaeabUhvm3nHqN9G4nLH8A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/aBLx...</a>  \"a bed of sweet potato hash browns topped with two Happy Eggs frittata style with your choice of local Grateful Growers pork sausage, turkey sausage, or soysage,then covered with melted cheddar cheese and green onions - choice of toast or TLC biscuit\"  Yours truly- Grande Quande ($8.95), which is The Zada Janer 28205 Basic Breakfast ($6.95), plus a pancake: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aBLx9JlAMq_AuW6VAImSwg?select=CfqNtH_Bj68CHWmYukYs0g#CfqNtH_Bj68CHWmYukYs0g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/aBLx...</a>  \"two Free Range happy eggs any style with choice of one protein,and one carb, plus toast or TLC biscuit\"  The rancheros was nicely presented, and enjoyed by all three!  I must note, however, that both sister and Mom did NOT enjoy their cups of fair trade coffee, which they claimed tasted too bitter and stale.  I requested my eggs over medium, but they arrived well-done.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aBLx9JlAMq_AuW6VAImSwg?select=jnIy6l_IkpBwSMFLhBfTQw#jnIy6l_IkpBwSMFLhBfTQw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/aBLx...</a>  My protein choice was some wonderful country bacon (crispy pan-fried smoky pieces of ham sliced very thick!), and two small gluten-free pancakes that took the place of the bread and my side order of pancake.  These pancakes were tasty, albeit very greasy, a fact that wasn't evident until I unwrapped some leftovers to have on the plane a few hours later, which ended up in the garbage.  I really enjoyed the side of sweet potato hash- a tasty alternative to regular potatoes, which I am not able to consume anymore these days.  Overall, we enjoyed the food, but not the wait.",

    "text": "This was the weirdest and by far the worst dining experience in over 1.5 years in Charlotte. Spoiler: spend 2 hours there for a sandwich, nachos and a coffee. First, my family comes in for lunch, the place is busy and there's a family in line before us, so we get ready to wait. In the first 10 minutes nobody even acknowledges our presence. Everybody's just standing around waiting, while 3 different waitresses pass by on multiple occasions. Then the people in front of us get seated. We wait another 10 minutes before the waitress says she'll clear off one of 3 available tables. Two reminders and another 10 minutes later we get seated. The table she cleared off for us has trash around it - straws, utensils, crumbled up dirty napkins on the floor. We wait 15 minutes for the waitress to come around and get our drink order, which doesn't come at all. Then another waitress comes to take the order again, because the previous waitress \"just left\". At this point we've just given up on having any decent service, and agreed that the food has to be outstanding to make up for it. Half of our drink order comes, which were waters, and the waitress forgot to bring a third water for our daughter. I also ordered a cappuccino, which I had to remind the staff members twice about. Another 20 minutes pass. A guy in a dirty t-shirt emerges out of the kitchen, holding our plates: he has guacamole on his hands, touching my husband's plate with nachos, so the outside of the plate is filthy. The nachos were soggy, but if you wait for over an hour for lunch, anything becomes edible. I ordered a gobbler sandwich with a side of roasted potatoes. The sandwich was nothing special, potatoes were cold. You can tell our food was just sitting there forever before it was brought to us. After two reminders I finally got my cappuccino. It was served in a cute mug, but tasted like diner coffee and had a greasy film on top of it, instead of delicious looking milk foam. We finished our meal, at that point the family that was seated before us has just received their food. A few people at the tables around us had delicious looking breakfast items, but after today's experience, there's no way in hell I'm coming back to try those. I was looking forward to trying this place out, and everything from service and food to cleanliness of the place has left me greatly disappointed.",

Great variety and selection of healthy, fresh, and local food whether you are a vegetarian or not. The bacon is amazing as is the French toast and their Huevos. Sometimes we just grab a biscuit to go which is also a great option.  Don't miss out on this spot!

    "text": "Oh Zada Janes...such an adorable breakfast joint in the heart of Plaza Midwood. While I always want to love Zada Janes, I just like it. Maybe it's what I order?  Anywho, I love the feel of Zada Janes. Yeah, the parking can be a bit irritating, especially on the weekends, but the location is perfect for sauntering around the area. Inside ZJ is bright, cheery and quirky - a great fit for the location. The menu is inspired and offers up a ton of egg-y options for breakfast, but I'm personally more of a carbo-loaded sweet fan for my morning meal. I know, healthy.  But I stayed away from their pancakes and french toast to try out the Zada Janer - a simple, straight forward breakfast with eggs your style (my choice: scrambled), a protein (my choice: turkey bacon), a carb (my choice: fruit cup), and toast. The meal was just fine but nothing to write home about. My eggs were a little dry - maybe I'll ask for some cheesy scramblies next time? The fruit cup was generous and fresh and the turkey bacon was just so-so. For $8 this was plenty of food for me, but I can see how it could be perceived as a bit steep for bigger appetites.   I want to love Zada Janes as the service is laid back and friendly and it's so cute and homey inside, but for now I just like it. I am, however, a big fan that they support local ingredients and neighborhood events. Next time I'm going to rely on the knowledgeable servers and go for the good stuff.",

Certainly. Hip? I suppose. All that does not a restaurant destination make though.  The food sounds nice on the menu and the fact they are supporting local farms and growers is appreciated but the results are just so uneven. It tastes good but it's cold, it's hot but overcooked, it's hot and cooked properly but really doesn't taste quite right. It's perfectly prepared and delicious. Who can tell?  Add to that the fact that the front of the place is a disorganized mess and the staff is either surly or outright rude and condescending and I get back to my original sentiment. How is this place still open?",

I checked this place out yesterday for brunch and left with a full belly and happy thoughts. The inside is eclectic and funky with bright colors with knick knacks everywhere and artwork by local artists on the walls. It reminded me of a place I would find in San Francisco or another liberal city and that make me happy. Plus every song that came on was something found on my ipod so good music, bright colors and big brunch menu? Count me in.   I got the Booker T's East Side Hasher. The bottom layer was the sweet potatoes which had a hint of cinnamon, then the sausage (you can get piggy, turkey or soyage!!) topped with eggs, cheese and green onions. I just stared at this when they brought it to me because I wasn't sure on how to conquer this bad boy but I just started from the right and kept on going. The biscuit was fabu as well (not too dry yet not a grease bomb ala Bojangles) and they had a mixed berry jam and apple butter at the table in squirt bottles, which I found charming. I can't wait to go back here again and try one of their savory/sweet dishes for breakfast. I also loved their coffee, strong and they don't have matching coffee cups so you can get a funky cup from their collection or bring your own. I heard that you have to wait forever at this place and that parking can be a pain but I didn't experience that at all. Maybe it was because of the hour change? No clue. We were packed like sardines in there so if you're claustrophobic, this may not be the best option for you. When we left around noon, the outdoor area was packed, I can't wait to go back and play some corn hole while I wait!",

Staff:  Everyone I've met here is very friendly and helpful. We always get solid recommendations. We also get seated fairly quickly considering how busy it gets.   Food:  The food is always satisfying. I'm a southern boy, raised on southern food, on buscuits, gravies, cheeses, fried everything. Zada Jane's brings it proper with nice and satisfying versions of southern food that are not greasy and some have a sense of being healthy as well. As a vegetarian, the alternatives are great, as a previous meat-eater, I am always tempted to get some of the creative meat dishes.   Cost: Cost is on par with other restaurants in this genre. Affordable and very reasonable.",

Their sandwich options can feed any mood and their breads are always fresh.  The atmosphere, including the patio seating (corn hole included) also makes for an even better Zada experience. While I love the food for a quick bite and the restaurant itself, every time I've been there the service has always been a little lacking.
