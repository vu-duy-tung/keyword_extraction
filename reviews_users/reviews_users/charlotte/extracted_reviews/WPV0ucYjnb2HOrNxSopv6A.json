The beers are moderately priced as well as the food but the service has always been top notch. I've had their pizza which is delicious, pasta (also very good) but I'd say their best food is probably their chicken wings. I haven't sampled the flavors just yet because I seem to be stuck on the Bold'n Tangy ones but its never does me wrong. Also, the chili queso dip is quite a treat as well but if you order it for a app just be careful not to fill up on it because it can almost be a meal for two by itself.",

    "text": "We were touring Charlotte and in the mood for some new York style pizza. We found Hawthorne s Pizza to a place that we will be returning. The place looks like a converted garage and done with class.  We were greeted by a hostess at the door and seated in a booth for the 4 of us. Started out with some beers and iced tea. Beer was cold. Iced tea was a little weak. Ordered Crispy Cajun Shrimp on a bed of Cole slaw. Very tasty and would order again. We also ordered Long Island Wings. Kind of a mix between hot and sweet. The table liked the but honestly I like my wings a little hotter. I always judge the quality of the pizza with no toppings. Toppings tend to compensate for other shortcomings so we ordered a plain pie. Took about 20 minutes. The crust is thin and not too greasy on the surface. Mozzarella appears to be skim mozzarella, (which I prefer) vs whole milk.  All in all the pizza was delicious and is the closest to New York pizza. Stop by and try the t out.",

We had an 18\" pie which give you 8 big slices to fold over and eat.  My son had the Mac and Cheese and said it didn't look like the kind I make out of a box but that it tasted good.   The sever was very friendly as were the guys making the pizza.  They have a little stage that the kids can walk up on and look through the glass at them making pizza.  Looked like they enjoyed playing with the kids while tossing the dough.  If you can get their early or just at the right time I recommend eating outside as it is a very relaxed atmosphere.  Only complaint is parking is tight.  A small lot up front, but after 5 there is parking around the side/rear, just obey the signs posted as one business doesn't let you park at anytime for anyone but them.",

However - the garlic knots here are TO DIE FOR. They are huge, and come out piping hot, drenched in olive oil and garlic, and baked just right - a tiny bit crisp in the outer crust and very soft inside.",

Vibe is pretty straightforward sports bar, but very family friendly and overall laid back. $1.50 drafts on Mondays and $2 and change other nights, can't beat it. The Hawthorne salad is delicious and I've had the sausage and pepperoni calzone that was also amazing. Haven't gotten any farther on the menu yet.   For what it is, a neighborhood-family-pizza place where the moms and dads can also have a drink, it gets 5 stars.",

It's not fancy restaurant or anything by any means, but it's not trying to be, and what they offer up is actually really good and really inexpensive.   Now I'm a New Yorker, so I'm not really sure what about this place qualifies as \"NY Pizza,\" but it's pretty good stuff for the most part. I grabbed a personal pizza as entree, which was just the right size--you can finish it and not feel completely ill for the rest of the night. Mine has roasted sun dried tomatoes and garlic on it. Very enjoyable. I also had a salad, which was much bigger than expected and also super tasty and fresh. They have lots of beers and even some wine, so you can really get a full meal here if you want.   This place was pretty bumpin' for a random wednesday night, so apparently the secret is out: great place for a casual meal or beer. They have outdoor seating too, which is super nice.",

Ive ordered take out before which is great. they have a couple spots out back reserved for take out and a special area for you to pick it up which makes it convenient.   I have been to 3 of the 5 Hawthorne's locations and what is great about them is that they are consistent across all the restaurants in terms of taste and quality.

Hawthorne's pizza is pretty solid, though, and one of the better pizzas you will have in Charlotte IMO.   The downside is that it is extremely greasy pizza and your stomach feels it into the next day.  I would just recommend not going crazy on the pepperoni pizza here in order to avoid the pizza hangover.",

They also offer a great wine list, cocktail selection, and bar setting if that's your thing. I had the cheeseburger pizza, and the tomatoes were to fresh, sweet and juicy, that I had to catch the juice with my napkin whenever I took a bite. The staff greeted me quickly, and I didn't have to wait long for a waiter even though it was lunch time. For a quick lunch I'd recommend Hawthorne's any day of the week. :-)",

    "text": "This review today is brought to you by Hawthorne's garlic knots.  Buttery, garlicy, fantastically delicious garlic knots.  And hey, their pizza's not bad either!  After two visits, I can safely add this to my list of go-to pizza places.  I have lived close to Hawthorne's and driven by it many, many times, and for the life of me, I don't know why I have never stopped in.  I suppose it was fear of being disappointed by sub-par pizza, but my fear was definitely unfounded.  A friend suggested we meet here for lunch one day, and so I showed up.  She had never eaten here, but she told me she'd had their garlic knots before.  She decided to order some, and I got to have one.  They looked and smelled fantastic, completely dowsed in butter and oil, an explosion of garlic everywhere, and some herbs thrown in for good measure.  I can safely say these are the most magical (and probably unhealthy) garlic knots I have eaten.  And normally, I don't care for the marinara sauce served with the bread.  However, I loved Hawthorne's!  It is the perfect balance of sweet and flavorful, with chunks of tomatoes in the sauce.  Yum!  I also tried a couple different types of pizza.  I had the Greek pizza, with kalamata olives, tomatoes, feta, and onions.  I loved it.  Their Elizabeth special is like a supreme pizza, and it was also very good.  The crust is not necessarily full of flavor, but it has a great chewy texture traditional of hand tossed pizza.  The sauce tasted the same as the marinara dipping sauce (it may have been thicker).  One thing I appreciate is that Hawthorne's does not skimp on the toppings, especially the cheese.  In addition to pizza and garlic knots, they have a pretty large menu with other appetizers, pasta, sandwiches, and even calzones, not to mention the plethora of salads offered on their menu.  Hand tossed pizzas come in either 9\" or 18\", but they don't have one in between.  They also offer a Sicilian pizza for an extra cost, but I did not get to see how big that was.  Pizza prices are about standard for Charlotte, about $8-10 for the small pizza and about $14-$19 for the large pizzas.    Dining in, the service was pretty good.  The staff was friendly and helpful when we were there.  The first time I got carry out, I didn't realize they had a separate area for that.  The carry out area is on the side, facing Hawthorne Street.  As far as parking, they do have a pretty decent amount.  They have a small lot in the front with just a few spaces, but they have a larger lot behind the building.  I will definitely keep coming back, especially for those garlic knots.  If you order them, just be prepared with breath mints and Tums.",

Takeout is fast and easy and there is plenty of space in the dining area.  We haven't sat in the dining room in a long long time so I cannot speak on how service is now but in the past it has been great.  If you get a chance and feel on the wild side, order the fried cheesecake for dessert.  AWESOME!!!!",

The Double Cheese, Sausage & Onion pizza just didn't hit the spot for me.  The crust was disappointingly floppy, with no crisp to it & it was a thin crust.  Even the crust edge was just meh.  The chicken wings were nice and crispy, but again - not my favorites in town. They brought out some special barbeque sauce for my sweetie to dip the wings into and that sauce was really, really good.  Dark, smoky, delish.  The did have Great Lakes beer & I had a witbier with spices & chamomile & I really liked that.  It was different, only slightly fruity, not super sweet - It was the chamomile, but I don't know exactly how to describe the taste, but if you're open for new flavors - give it a try!  So, I'd go back, but probably just to hang out, not specifically for the pizza or wings.",

I used to work in University City and had been to that one a couple of times but I happen to find myself in uptown, and hungry, so this was a welcomed sight. The pizzas at here are absolutely amazing, one of my favorites being the barbecue. But I was visiting a friend in the hospital down the street and needed something more comforting. For an appetizer, we got the House chips. OMG! These things are sooo good and they aren't cut too thin, which is a pet peeve of mine. It's served with a sauce that seems like mayo and hot sauce which is damn good. (I'll have to figure this out so I can use it at home) I ordered the lasagna. I'm a fan of the lasagna, but please note...it's made with sausage. Kinda like the sausage crumbles you would get on a pizza made with sausage. It's goo though! It's served with 2 garlic toast wedges, but if you need a sauce sopping apparatus, order the garlic knots...they do not disappoint. There's also a separate to go entrance and an amazing patio that I have yet to use. Maybe next time!",

But we have always been pleasantly surprised with the ordering out. It can tend to be a bit pricy for what you get which is the only reason I rated it as 4 stars instead of 5. We also ordered meals one time and being from NY you are used to spending about 15$ on a pasta meal but they usually come with a decent amount of bread and salad which it does not come with at Hawthornes. And the serving size of the pasta dishes was VERY small. We ordered 4 entrees and it was barely enough to feed 4 of us which was disappointing, but the food itself was really good. I will definitely continue ordering pizza from Hawthornes and would like to come in and dine in soon to see if its any different than ordering entrees out. Overall, really good experiences and really enjoy the food!",

    "text": "I have been dying to go to Hawthorne's Pizza to meet my sister for lunch! We attempted to go on a Monday and they are now closed for lunch on Mondays. We rescheduled and went out today. Ordered the special slice of the day and a slice of cheese. Patiently waited trying to keep the baby entertained with various means. After 35 minutes I asked if there was some sort of delay. I had seen many other tables receive salads, Stromboli, etc. They said they had to make \"another\" cheese pizza. At this point, you offer to give two slices of the special or something else. This is lunch. At a pizza by the slice place! We wait 10 more minutes and finally get our \"special\" slices (one with toppings and with with one piece of pepperoni and a mushroom). We separated our slices served on just one plate and ate those still awaiting this amazing cheese-only slice. Finally receive this piece. Now we've been at Hawthornes for 50 minutes and have not been offered refills, apologies for delays, Nothing. The bill is $9.15 for two small slices of pizza that took forever. I am sorry. I loved Hawthornes but this is bad service, slow lunch and in my opinion definitely not a good value.",

The nice hostess had to take our drink orders and another 10 mins passed by and the lady who was our server came by just to card my husband. Okay that's fine but she didn't take our order for yet another 10 mins. Our food took pretty long as well. I ordered a calzone that was just a pizza shell folded in half. It wasn't sealed or doughy or anything like a calzone but our waitress wasn't around for me to ask her so I ate it. Took us almost 2 hours to get out of there. I'll chalk this one up as a weird night, but not overly happy.",

    "text": "Not my favorite pizza in Charlotte, but it holds it's own.  Crust is not a thick dough-fest and they have a mix of different kinds of specialty pies (buffalo wing pizza is memorable, in a good way) and salads that are tasty and freshly made.  The real star, for when I need a total carb overload, is the garlic knots appetizer- the perfect mix of crusty and soft bread slathered in copious quantities of minced garlic and a butter sauce.  A once in a blue moon treat 'cause my arteries clog up at the very thought of ordering even a small portion of these.  Downgrade here is that, despite a pretty large bar with the omni-present big screens, families still schlock their ill-mannered kids in here by the minivan load.  The wife and I literally left here before dinner came one Friday night because a table in the bar area was stocked with \"little darlings\" who couldn't stop the pee-wee dough-tossing contest that became distracting and downright annoying.    To his credit, the manager on duty did come out to the parking lot to inquire, but all he offered was to buy us a beer \"next time.\"  I'm all for kids being allowed out, but all I ask is that they be somewhat well-mannered and that you don't sit them in the bar area.  Giving them free pizza dough to toss around was only inviting trouble.  Restaurant owners- stick to the box of crayons and the colorable place mat, please.  Prices are a little high in comparison, but not obnoxiously so.  Big draw for warmer months is the outdoor patio.  It can get crowded on weekends, and a wait is sometimes part of the deal.  The cold beer selection only makes the experience better.  Also check out the drink specials, they're not bad if you luck up and find something that fits you palette.",

Generally the service is pretty friendly/funny and attentive.   Their wide variety of pizzas generally will please most people (though my husband really doesn't like their crust because of blandness). I don't mind the regular crust but I regret to admit that their gluten-free crust is offensive. I like their white pies and chicken + spinach/garlic.  Their pasta dishes aren't bad and they also offer eggplant parm which though it's vegetable based is far from healthy! :) I used to like their knots but I think they're not moist enough now. or maybe I'm just getting grumpier. My favorite two things about Hawthorne's? The craveworthy cannoli for dessert and their Twitter account. Huh? All I have to do is tweet to @HawthornesPizza and easy peasy, within 2-3 tweets they deliver whatever you want ultra pronto! Now that's service and for some reason seemed way easier than ordering on the phone!  One time they knew I had surgery and couldn't leave the house and gave me an extra special treat. If you're not as lazy as that, they have a convenient To-Go counter next door closer to the back parking lot.",

    "text": "Was here Sunday for hangover pizza with the boyfriend.  It was full for a rare rainy day in Charlotte - keep in mind this is very FAMILY oriented during the day.  So we were surrounded by kids which are cute when they are not yelling and chasing each other around the restaurant.  There is a little platform for the kiddies to walk up and watch the pizza makers - which is adorable for about five seconds.  If you cant stand the idea of lots of kids just eat in the bar...really it isnt bad!  We got the side salad for $3.95 which is more than enough to split between two people (the balsamic vinaigrette is just fine here).  And we got the 18 inch Crew pizza which is very good - crust is crispy, the pizza is thin and comes with slices of meatballs, italian sausage and banana peppers.  Everything was very good!  I think our total bill was $24 before tip (no drinks) so that is reasonable enough for me!    Service has always been spotty here unless you are sitting at the bar.  I would definitely recommend getting some sort of app if you are ordering a whole pizza cause a whole pizza definitely takes time to make and cook so you may starve waiting unless you have something to nibble on!   I am from NY so I am a harsh judge.  I have had a lot of 'good' NY style pizza in Charlotte....Hawthorne is definitely A-OK.  PS - The best thing about Hawthorne's is the take-out wing they put in where my cute dry-cleaning lady used to be.  I have been picking up pizzas here before and either someone was a no-show or some order got scewed up and they have asked me if i wanted the rejected pie for free - why yes of course who can resist extra pizza???  Very good karma-creator!",

Hawthorne's is a fairly straight forward pizza join - there are two areas, one large dining room and one more \"bar-ish\" area with plenty of high top tables. Hubs and I usually grab a seat in the latter as there can be lots 'o kiddos running around in the main dining area (depending on the day, of course). The service is quick and friendly and they have a decent beer list to accompany their 'za.  If I'm super hungry I'll usually start off with the Garlic Cheese Bread - exactly what you would think: a hefty portion of toasted French bread, smothered in a multitude of cheeses and garlic and served with a very tasty marinara. Truth - sometimes I just prefer to make this my meal with a small side salad. But...if I'm ordering pizza, I'm a fan of their veggie as well as their white pizza. I do, however, feel the need to blot that sucker every time it comes out. But hey - that seems normal, right?  Thanks to Hawthorne's I can grab a tasty slice at lunch or hang out for a while and take down a multitude of cheesy goodness.",

My orders rotate between the cheese pizza, eggplant wrap, gorgonzola salad or wild mushroom ravioli. For lunch I normally sit at the bar and order a slice or a salad. Bartenders are attentive and usually will chat up an interesting conversation.   Staff is always friendly, food comes out hot and fast. The only thing I wish they did different was serve pizza by the slice all day long - it's only an option at lunch. Sometimes after work I would love to go in and grab a slice and a beer instead of ordering a whole pie - but if that's my only negative, you won't be disappointed!",

When the only other pizza around was Fuel they had more of a leg to stand on, but combine the slightly-higher prices, meh pizza, and no delivery and I find myself asking no one in particular why I got in the car to come pick up my 20 dollar pizza. Plus the parking here is superannoying.  Lunch is a steal, but unless you're grabbing a slice of the special (which I've never seen a veg-friendly option for) you're getting cold toppings tossed on top of a dried out slice and no cheese to help them blend. So even at 7.50 for slice, beverage, and salad, I just can't get stoked. Patio looks comfy, tho, so maybe I'm missing the beer+pizza+pal charm. In which case, this review is TBC!",

Food finally provided at 7:05pm after order was placed around 5:45pm. With 2 young kids who at this point were crying from being hungry and 4 adults with a simple order, this was beyond a disappointing experience.  The manager for the evening was incredibly rude, dismissive, and completely unapologetic not to mention physically grabbed the arm of someone in our party.   Our family will never waste our time or money here again. The owner should be ashamed of the service.",

I was quite sad when I opened the container and saw chicken that didn't look blackened, just looked as it had been cooked on a dirty grill. I threw the chicken away and gave the pasta a try. I was expecting Alfredo sauce, but's it's more of a carbonara sauce. There's either pieces of ham or bacon in it, which I wasn't expecting. On top of that, it's watered down. Almost as if the noodles weren't drained after boiling just pulled out and throw in. I've eaten here many times and never had an issue. Hopefully, next time, it will be better",

    "text": "Came here on a Saturday night and was surprised at how slow it was. Must of been because of Restaurant Week. We didn't have trouble at all with parking. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who sat us right away. I was here with a party of 4.   We got 12 garlic knots and was so surprised at how large the knots were. Huge! Like fist size. They were drizzled with garlic and butter. It was honestly one of the best garlic knots that I have ever had! Marinara sauce that came with it was delicious. You can tell it was homemade which I like! We also got the chili cheese dip. It came tortilla chips. It was a large portion. Had onions and sour cream on top too! If we would of known how large the garlic knots were, we definitely wouldn't of gotten this.   We ended up getting two large pizzas. One was half elizabeth (supreme) and half meat. The other was half chicken buffalo and half chicken pesto. They were all good!! My favorite was the meat. We also took out the italian sausage and subbed it with meatball and I'm glad we made that decision. Their meatball is so tender and flavorful. Both pizzas had a lot of toppings on it. You couldn't barely see a spot of cheese on it. Pizzas had the right amount of crusts too!   I knocked down one star because our server wasn't that attentive. I asked for a sweet tea and there were maybe 4 ice cubes in it. It was so hot I had to ask for a glass of ice. The guys got beers that were on special and they were not discounted on the check so we had to ask for the discount. We asked for more chips because we had so much dip left and she never brought it out. We had to ask for it again and that was towards the end of our meal. We wanted boxes for our pizza and garlic knots and she only boxed the pizzas. We had to ask her to box our garlic knots, it's not like there was 1 left, there were 5 left. She didn't ask us how we wanted the checks and just assumed it was 1 ticket. We told her that it was separate (there were only 4 of us so it would only be 2 checks, one for each couple). Then she told us that she was gonna just split it completely in half. We asked her if we could split it by what we paid for because some people got drinks and some didn't and the pizzas were a different price as well as the appetizers. She made it seem like it was a chore for us but to me that's pretty standard.",

Mozzarella sticks were good and beer selection is always on point. they have good specials during the week like kids eat free on Tuesday. Only downside, their buffalo chicken pizza does not do it for me :( I tried it twice and I just feel like it doesn't have that kick of spice and flavor that I love out of buffalo chicken pizzas. I'll only have it again if I need my labor induced since it apparently it does the trick! :D",

    "text": "Haven't met anyone that doesn't like Hawthorne's Pizza.  Located at the corner of 7th and Hawthorne, it seems like this place has grown into an essential component of the neighborhood.  Especially due to the fact that Hawthorne's has a lot of family and kid-centered nights and specials.  Here's your guide to Hawthorne's...  Parking:  There is a parking lot exclusively for Hawthorne's patrons.  Even with the lot however, parking can be an issue at times.  Obviously more so during peak hours like Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings, nothing crazy, but just be warned...  Food:  Where do I start?  How about with the Carlos Sweet Wings - 7/$7.75.  I absolutely love this flavor, very unique, similar to a bar-b-lo flavor, but with more \"bar\", than \"lo\"  The calamari is excellent - some of the best, crispy, crunchy, tender, calamari I've ever eaten - the marinara sauce simply enhances your taste experience.  What about the Mussels Fra-Diablo?!  The sauce/broth they are served in works perfectly - I can inhale every last mussel within seconds!    As for the pie - the Buffalo Wing and BBQ Chicken pizzas stand out for me, I'm usually reluctant to order these styles/flavors of pizzas, but at Hawthorne's they know how to do the chicken pizzas better than any place else.  I've had most of their pastas and can vouch for them all - I like the Shrimp Scamp & Broccoli (but I ask for fettucini pasta not angel hair).  What stands out most about the pastas is that you can add whatever meat - chicken, meatballs, sausage or shrimp to any pasta. So there's def a lot of flexibility and possibilities with the pastas.    Service:  No complaints.  Service is good.  Never had any issues either seated at a table in the dining area or at the bar.   Relaxed family atmosphere, tasty food, friendly service, perfect location,  whats not to like?",

    "text": "NOT GOOD!! Not authentic NY pizza what-so-ever. First of all, they only serve slices at lunch. WTF!? You can't claim to be NY pizza and not serve slices. That's how the pizza gets so crispy is being baked by the slice. Never mind that, the pizza is actually very mediocre. On a good day, it's only marginally better than Papa John's.  The service is usually very poor and slow. The employees usually congregate behind the bar and chit chat while you need basic things like napkins or drink refills.  The ambiance is generally kind of sad, usually pretty empty and dark. No surprise there! My final complaint about this place is its overpriced / priced unfairly.  For example, a large cheese pizza is $14, but a single topping is $3. So two toppings almost equal an entire pizza? Meanwhile you can get any of their signature pizzas with 6+ toppings for $21.  The pasta portions are incredibly small for how much you're paying.  The wings are breaded! Are you serious!? Who the heck breads wings!? Oh, I get it, it makes them look bigger and more filling.  I will be sure to steer other away from this place!",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to the Elizabeth neighborhood of Charlotte and to Hawthorne's New York Pizza and Bar.   Elizabeth is named after Anne Elizabeth Watts, the only Charlotte neighborhood named for a woman. You can read more about the history here.   Dora here. Don't let this picture deceive you. We arrived right at eleven, and by the time we left, both inside and out was jammed. Hawthorne's appears to be a popular place for locals as many people walked here.  The garlic cheese bread appetizer was cheesy with just the right amount of garlic. It came out fast, the cheese bubbling and gooey, and browned to perfection.   Dora here. This cheesy bread reminded me of our favorite pizza place in Florida. We always divided it up into equal portions because our son ravaged it. Same thing happened this time, but with our grandson. A sure sign that it was a winner. :)  We wanted to pace ourselves, so we ordered the 9\" Meat Eaters pizza, and we were glad we did.  This pizza was loaded with meat (pepperoni, Italian sausage, beef, ham, bacon) and mozzarella. In each bite, I tasted all of the different meat flavors, and they all worked together. One thing we noticed, unlike other meat pies which tend to be greasy and heavy, this pizza was light with no greasy aftereffects.   Dora here. I really wanted to order the Sicilian, but that only comes in GIANT size, so since we were ordering cheesy bread and dessert, I compromised on this. Not my favorite pizza, but it was good. I appreciated that it wasn't heavy on the sauce or spice.   Check out the Cannoli Plate, three mini cannolis.   Dora here. We first sampled cannolis in Sicily, and loved them! Since then, we've tried the US versions, and none of them have come close to what we experienced overseas. Not that we're food snobs, but buttercream filling..really? Yuck! Hawthorne's cannolis tasted like the real deal, ricotta and cream cheese goodness in a fried pastry! Three minis were just the right size to cap off our meal. Well, Little Man didn't think so. :)   We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.  What's your favorite pizza hangout?

It was pretty empty for lunch and thought I would get pizza... considering the name but I was craving fries and what better to get with fries, than a sandwich.   For a pizza joint (they have other food, yes) their sandwich was pretty good. The Bacon chicken ranch sandwich was really good. The bread was like a thick garlic knot without the garlic, but was lightly seasoned. The chicken was seasoned well. The lettuce and tomato were fresh. The cheese, ranch and Bacon added the saltiness and creaminess to the sandwich. It was pretty tasty and filling. My homie agreed.   The fries were decent.   Service was good. She came the minimum times I expect, so definitely no complaints there. $10 for all of that, I'll go back.",

The problem is we sat down on the barstools and immediately tried to small talk with him but he wasn't having it so we ordered 4 lemon drop shots which he told us he couldn't make so we told him how and he made them (he said \"well this is a family restaurant, see the kids running around\") ha.. ok. We also ordered 4 beers which we never got. We got apps and wanted to order a pizza to go. Well we ordered the apps but he never came back to check on us so we ended up going next door to order the to go order. We never felt welcome and we would've spent way more time and money there but instead we left.   The food however was delicious as always but we will probably just order to go over the phone from now on.",

    "text": "Overall a very great experience. Very good service and food was overall decent.   Started with the meatballs - they're fantastic. Not that I've tried most things on the menu, but this has to be one of the best things on the menu. The parmesan really comes through - I'd love to have the recipe for the mix. They're a must have.   Hawthornes is currently doing a corned beef fest for St Pattys, which brought me there (currently trying all the Reubens in Charlotte on a Reuben adventure, this makes 32). They added a Reuben to their menu and also have a Reuben pizza.   I'll start with the Reuben. Very mediocre. Marbled rye that wasn't crisped, sub par corned beef, almost no cheese, standard kraut from a bag. It wasn't a bad reuben, just nothing at all about it stood out. I'd say not worth venturing out to try during their special.   Onto the pizza - it was good, but I expected more Reuben flavors. I've had the pizza from Hawthornes before (they have one that has meatballs on, recommend that), and it is very good pizza. But the Reuben ingredients weren't done in the best way. Only a little bit of corned beef and a very thin layer of the thousand island sauce - nothing like their picture. I couldn't taste any Swiss which I feel is essential for a Reuben pizza (I don't think they added any). It was overall an enjoyable experience, but probably not worth the price tag on the large pizza ($23).",

For a predominately pizza place, their other entrees are impressively good too! I really love their large entree salads. My husband and I will often get an antipasto salad as well as a pizza.   Last time I was there I also had their gluten free penne pasta. it was delicious! The upcharge for the specialty pasta was a tad high ($4) but it was worth it to me to not get the terrible stomach ache after.  The beer selection is good too. And they have a few ciders and wines. They even have a covered patio so you can bring your pup on a leash with you, even when it's raining.   One thing we also like about this place is the convenience of the separate \"To Go\" section. No awkward waiting in line or standing by the bar in the middle of a busy restaurant. Which I appreciate.",

The pizza has been great both times, but beware if you like ranch as much as I, it's $0.75 each additional cup and they are quite small. The food was prepared quickly, which is great due to the fact I had to be back in class within the hour. The prices are decent and I love the fact that they offer a \"by the slice\" option during lunch hours.   On to the server, Camille seems to lack a certain je ne sais quoi that every server should have, I don't know if it's due to the fact that she is just very straightforward or if she just does not enjoy her job but she comes off as slightly rude and nonchalant. Honestly, her attitude is enough to deter me from eating inside and to order to-go the next time I visit this Hawthorne's location, or request a different server.",

They also have a mobile app. There's even a super convenient take out door that's completely separate from the restaurant. You know what that means, your girl is picking up her food in sweatpants.  App-wise, we always order the chili queso dip. It may sound odd to get at an Italian place, but it's delicious. My go to pizza here is the Elizabeth Special (Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Mushrooms, Bell Peppers, White Onions) and I always add jalapenos. I also like their Penne Spinach Portabella. I love the spicy gorgonzola sauce and the drizzled balsamic on top. Right now, my current obsession is their Philly Cheesesteak. Anything smothered in melty cheese and chipotle mayo wins in my book.   Kids eat free on Tuesdays, half price bottles of wine on Sundays. They also have a gluten free menu.",

Why are there always screaming children running wild in this place? I guess parents think a restaurant that serves pizza is automatically geared for kids. Can't blame the place for that, but all the hard surfaces only amplify the din...and then there are all those TVs, at least 3, which is a lot for a pretty small place. Even my friend who is an elementary school teacher couldn't handle the noise!",

The service was great, our server was super friendly, and a manager came to check on us twice. However, the chicken on the pizza I ordered tasted like canned chicken?? I was very disappointed that a place like this would do that. The pizza itself and sauce were delicious, but the chicken ruined it. It was still edible, and I did not complain as my boyfriend would have died of embarrassment, but I won't order that again. If you'd just cook the chicken in house it would have been fantastic!! The food was 2 stars, but I gave 3 for the service.  Update- the manager reached out to me and mailed me a gift card- totally unnecessary but very appreciated. I added a star.",

It was really cool that half the restaurant was a nice seating area and the other half was more or a sports bar which I can imagine being fun to watch games. My boyfriend and I split an 18\" New Yorker. He got pepperoni on his side and I got mushroom and red onion on mine. The pizza tasted very good and I really enjoyed the mushroom and red onion combo. The crust was a bit bready for being NY style, but I kinda like that. Not the best pizza in the area but definitely above average! The service was a little slow, which was strange since it was dead, but nothing too bad. Hawthorne's is a great spot when you're wanting pizza in a slightly more upscale location while still not breaking the bank.",

We ordered two personal pizzas which took a long time considering the place was pretty empty, the ingredients weren't that fresh, and very little toppings made it onto the special of the day.   The flavor on the specialty was ok, even though it was mostly crust and the balsamic was burn-your-nose vinegary. The spinach was not fresh and we would definitely not have finished it had we not been starving to begin with.   The server was nice but the service was just awkward, not smooth or timely, and you could hear the different functions (front of house, back of house, manager, random TV changer/cleaner) definitely didn't coordinate well. Also, everything was dirty and gross to touch. The tables were sticky, the seats were oily, the menus were nasty, and even leaving the restroom with clean hands was a tribulation!  No one got food poisoning but we also got home and immediately ate a real dinner. We won't be back.",

We came in on a Sunday evening and it was relatively quiet inside and not too busy, but I think the Hawthorne St. construction effects it. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised to find this wasn't just a pizza joint, but a pizza and Italian restaurant spot similar to what we would find in the northeast. The smells as soon as we entered were intoxicating and I debated my pizza decision upon entering, but we we were on a mission.   I ordered a side house salad with their house dressing to start and a 9\" of their buffalo chicken (the inducer) pizza. My husband started with their mozerella sticks and a 9\" of the Elizabeth pizza. He didn't want mushrooms on his pizza and they let him \"swap\" toppings without an additional fee or anything, which was awesome. The side salad was massive, and their house dressing was really good...just tangy enough. My husband enjoy his sticks (which is a hard thing to mess up). The pizzas came out and they were piping hot, but had that delicious crispy crust and melty cheese perfection that I look for in a good slice. The 9\" was a perfect size to have for dinner and then have some leftovers for lunch the next day.   Overall, I was impressed with Hawthorne's and even though the inducer didn't work for me (little lady is stubborn), we will be back after she's born to try some of their pasta dishes!",

I know they have several locations in the Charlotte area, but Charlotte also has a lot of neighborhoods to keep happy (and the neighborhoods keep growing it seems).  All the construction on Hawthorne Ln with the bridge removal has probably made it super hard for this location, but they recently opened the street back up so it feels like there's a light at the end of the tunnel.  They have more than just pizza here!  Salads, pastas, and sandwiches... the food definitely shines here.  Probably my favorite thing is watching little kids climb up the staircase so they can watch the pizza makers toss the dough and they even get some of their own to be interactive.  TVs surround the walls so probably not a bad spot to watch a game or event.  Though, I do have to note that it was a slow event day since one of the TVs had a professional corn hole tournament on it.  The staff are always friendly, I can see the place getting super busy so you just have to be patient sometimes.  A neighborhood pizza place is definitely to be enjoyed, not rushed!  Relax with the beers on tap.  I had a local brew from Legion just for the Elizabeth 8k to where Hawthorne's is one of the sponsors for the race.",

Spoiler alert: baby didn't make her debut due to the pizza (ugh), but the silver lining is we found another favorite pizza place in the CLT area.  Everyone was so friendly at the Elizabeth location, from the hostess, to our server, to the manager that checked on us multiple times during our meal. The Inducer was actually quite tasty -- we admittedly aren't huge fans of chicken on our pies, but would honestly order this specific pizza again, pregnant or not! :) We chose to do a half-and-half large pizza (and by large, I mean LARGE - we took home three huge slices). The second half  was \"The Crew Pizza\" with sausage, meatballs, banana peppers, and red onion - equally delicious! The pan-tossed crust is thin in the center and cripsy and fluffy at the end. Pro tip: dip your crust in the house-made jalapeno ranch.   Despite the fact that Baby didn't arrive post-Inducer tasting, it's safe to say we'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "We've been going to Hawthorne's for years. Since our kids were young and would get a ball of dough to play with. Part of it is the excellent pizza, but part of it is the service too.  This past weekend we took our nephew out for a birthday pizza before heading to an event uptown and stopped at Hawthorne's. The order of garlic knots came as usual. Crispy on the outside and soft inside and tons of garlic butter sauce! All of us ordered individual pizza and they were excellent. But the pizza took a little longer than usual to arrive and not only did the server apologize, but two managers came by too. Very proactive. We weren't upset and we weren't in a rush, but they wanted to make sure we were happy.  That's the type of experience I have had for years. On the rare occasion there's an issue, they seem to recognize it and correct it.   After so many years of consistency and crowds that keep coming, that's part of the reason why",

I like the buffalo chicken pizza, but the other toppings are great as well.    The service is probably my only negative comment.  We had to go on a search for our own utensils after asking and waiting on some for a full 5 minutes while our pizza was getting cold...  Otherwise, great pizza place in CLT!  Take-out is also great!",

Our server was excellent and was extremely patient as we went back and forth over what pizzas we wanted to try. Not to mention he was on top of our drink refills every time.  i glanced through some Yelp reviews before heading here and happened to remember someone saying the Garlic Knots were \"TO DIE FOR\". i don't know if i'd die for a garlic knot, however these garlic knots were delish. Meat lovers pizza was the specialty slice of the day and was pretty good. Spinach pizza was so-so, kind of plain (as i expected as the ingredients were spinach and cheese, but told the wife to try it since i was getting my own slices). We wouldn't get the spinach pizza  It didn't wow me enough to add to the list of repeat restaurants, but not a bad place.",

    "text": "My fiance and I ate here today.  We ordered a large pepperoni and cheese pizza.  I was excited because I have driven by this place many times and it looks cool from the front.  When we received our pizza it was extremely greasy.  I did not want to say anything though because I didn't want my fiance to not eat it.  So I toughed out the first slice.  Before I was about to eat my next slice she said \"we need more napkins, this pizza is extremely greasy\".  I agreed so I went to the front and got more napkins.  On the way back to my table I glanced at another pizza with pepperoni on it at the table beside us and noticed it wasn't as greasy.  When I got back to our table my fiance dabbed about 5 napkins full of grease.  Then I looked at my plate and it was covered in grease.  I came clean, I told my fiance that this pizza is way too greasy.  I said I checked the table behind me, they have a similar order and their pizza is no were near as greasy as ours.  I worked at Speedy's Pizza in Sylva NC for three years and never once saw a pizza made that greasy.  I told her we have to say something.  So we flagged our waitress down and told her and she got the manager.  When the manager came to the table, where there were noticeably 5 disgusting napkins and grease everywhere, and asked us what the problem was?  We said look at our pizza, it is covered in grease.  She said; \"obviously you have not tried our pepperonis\".  And my fiance said \"look, I have never seen a pizza this greasy in my life\".  I decided to cut in because I felt the conversation was getting ridiculous.  I just asked that she comp our pizza and we will pay for all the other items we ordered.  The manager became emotional and took offense to this.  She kept asking if she could make us a cheese pizza.  I didn't want to go through all of that I wanted to leave by now and she said; \"never have I had a customer not let me make it right\".  But she said it really loud and it embarrassed the hell out of us. To make matters worse, in the back this waitress made 2 comments.  The first one was, \"I ate that pizza they sent back and it was amazing!!\"  The second was \"I'm going to send back 3 perfectly good 18 inch pizzas today from pain in the ass customers just to see what happens\"  Me and my fiance were embarrassed.  Look, I worked in that industry.  I know it's a hard job.  I always said once I get out of the industry I will look back on my experience there and tip well and be polite to cooks and waitstaff.  I always do that.  However, I am not going to get diarrhea and be sick all night and pay 16 some odd dollars for a pizza to appease these people.  The pizza was not edible.  The manager did comp us our entire meal and gave us a free cheese pizza.  In all honesty, it was a back handed deal.  She was upset with us, they were talking about us noticeably loud in the back and she wanted to make a point.  Look, we didn't like the greasy pizza OK?  No love lost, we don't want any problems.  We did accept the pizza which is probably covered in spit.  I just wanted to say, upon further review, this cheese pizza taste like computer paper.  So there, I still don't like it.  Don't eat here.",

    "text": "Hawthorne's is like the superhero of pizza shops.  Mild mannered and family friendly during the day and primed to party at night. If you want to know what their pizza is like, look at the name of the joint.  It is NY style pizza.  This is the stuff that you see diet conscious people either picking up their slice and letting the grease drip off of or are dabbing it with a paper napkin.  I say let it stay. They also have a solid italian menu beyond just pizza with great pasta dishes.  You can't go wrong with baked ziti. Their pizza by the slice is part of their very reasonable lunch menu, but it also makes a return on the late night menu.  And trust me, sometimes you just need a slice after 11pm.   One such reason would be their Monday night special...  $1.50 drafts.  Now, usually when someone runs such a special, you look at the taps and read the names of watered down domestics.  Not here.  This is your New Castle, your Guinness, your Blue Moon, et cetera.  All of which taste good in the evening air out on the patio. The service is great and if Johnny V. is behind the bar, its a guaranteed good time.",

Dispite the crowd, we were seated quickly and received impecable service.  Our waitor was Steven, ask for him to be your server....he was polite, well spoken, friendly, attentive and very knowlegable about the menu.  We ordered the Chicken Picata and a small pizza.  We were not disappointed, the food was soooooo good. Everything came out of the kitchen hot, fresh and quick.  We had a great time.  The resteraunt is very well run and organized, and the service was amazing!   I will be sure to visit again very soon.",

The garlic knots are still pretty tasty and frickin HUGE! The staff is super friendly and very accomadating.  Even though their pizza is not #1 in my heart their pasta dishes are absolutely delicious.  I love love loved teh sauce for the gueyere penne and I substituted the suggested chicken or sausage with shrimp yummmmm.  The lasagna made me never want to make my own at home again!  I think the pizza has plenty of cheese and good taste they just need a crisper crust.  I have not visited any other locations and I do not feel the desire to.  The location in Elizabeth is pretty great all around.",

They have standard pizza topping options and a few adventurous choices as well.  I really liked the Luau  - which included pulled pork and pineapple!  Additionally they have a homemade ranch dressing that is pretty tasty.  There is a nice outdoor patio along with an indoor seating area and a bar area.  I'll definitely be back to enjoy Hawthorne's!",

I say that because, as a function of scarcity, it gets 4-stars... there simply aren't any other pizza shops that compete in Charlotte. That being said, it'll be standard fare in New York.  Pizza:  Since moving here three years ago, Hawthornes is the only pizza in Charlotte that does pizza the way I'm used to it. No, that's not the RIGHT way necessarily, just that it's the closest I've had to NY pizza since moving.  Food:  The other dishes are 3/5 for the most part, but the pizza is comfort enough for me.  It's definite Italian American (ie. calzones, chicken parm, etc.) and it does that reasonably well.  Staff: Most are kind and helpful, one or two will leave you wishing for a bit more.  Drinks:  All tap beers are 2.75 T-S and 1.50 on Mondays.  Great spot for Pizza and Beer.  They have to go service but do not deliver.",

Unfortunately I have tried it twice and both times it has fallen short. First time I ordered a pizza and buffalo chicken Stromboli. The pizza was decent although a little soggy and I asked for crispy. The buffalo chicken Stromboli on the other hand was just bread. It had very little flavor and even less chicken. I have been working in restaurants for tears now and never like to complain but I actually felt the need to call them about the Stromboli. I was told the manager would call me the next day and when the day came and went I called her. I believe her name is Michelle. I was told she would leave a gift certificate so we could try it again. So tonight we tried and ordered a Cajun chicken Philly. When we went to pick it up they had no idea we were suppose to have a credit which was frustrating but we left with the Philly. And again I am not impressed with the food, and this time the customer service as well. We had high hopes but keep getting let down. Oh well just one place to cross off the list.",

The pasta dishes tend to be so-so - I've ordered the spinach portabella pasta on multiple occasions and it unfortunately always misses the mark for me...really oily sauce that separates almost immediately, so 5 minutes you're eating noodles in a heavy, oily soup.

    "text": "We returned to Hawthorne's on a Sunday night and sat at a hightop near the bar area.  Instead of their delicious pizza, we decided to try their pastas for a change.   I went with the Gorgonzola Pasta with Sausage.  All I can say is:  WOW.  The pasta was so rich, creamy, and gorgonzola-y, it was simply amazing.  I literally could not get enough of it and could not stop eating it, despite feeling full after about 2/3 of it.  I had to finish it, savoring every bite.  The salty sausage was a great balance to the rich, cheesy taste of the sauce.  (My mouth is watering now just writing about it.)  So, the next time we go to Hawthorne's, I'm going to have the dilemma of choosing between this fantastic pasta dish again or go with one of their top-notch NY Style pizzas.   Note:  we were surprised at how many kids were in the restaurant for a Sunday night and asked our server if it was because of a \"kids eat free\" thing.  He said no, that it's always like that on the weekends.  Interesting.",

We were led to believe this place was the \"best pizza in Charlotte\". If it is truly the best pizza in Charlotte, then maybe Charlotte just isn't a great city for pizza. The crust wasn't anything special (and kinda hard...), the toppings were sparse, the sauce was \"meh\". One thing I did appreciate was the mid day specials. You can't beat $2.50 for a pint and $12 for an entire pizza.",

Keep in mind the name of the restaurant: 'Hawthorne's NY Pizza & Bar.' As far as both of these functions, this establishment has never let me down. The pizza is fresh, delicious, and the right consistency (thin but not papery). Also, I like how the sauce is still saucy and not stuck to the dough. I normally get the veggie but sometimes get the pepperoni mushroom as well!  Also, as a bar, the place has pretty decent prices for drafts all week long. I will re-update with official prices when I get a chance, but the selling point is definitely the pizza. With that said, DO NOT venture and try their other italian offerings (ravioli, subs, etc), as they pale in comparison.   In response to some of the negative reviews on this site, I just want to remind you to stay the course (NY Pizza & Bar) and you too will love this place!",

Nice outdoor seating and the part of the front-end of the restaurant opens up when the weather is nice. My kids love the pizza there as well. They can even go up and watch the pizza being made. The pizza guy always gives them a ball of dough to play with too! That is their favorite thing and it keeps them occupied too. Great bar area to hang out with friends. Really good place to meet with a group of people. Service is usually good and friendly with attentiveness issues every now and then when it's busy. Very small front parking lot, so parking can be a pain at times. Gotta try The Crew!",

    "text": "It really pains me to have to write this re-review. But I feel if I don't I would be doing a disservice to all Charlotte Yelpers who may find themselves in the same horrible, horrible, dining experience I had this afternoon.  I used to LOVE this place. I used to suggest it to all my friends, raving about the great NY style pizza, great atmosphere, and great service. Today I feel like I ate at a completely different restaurant.   Hostess was very sweet, cleaning off a table for us outside. We were sat, and then we sat. and sat. and sat. No one came over to even acknowledge us. After finally tracking down our waitress, we placed our drink orders and and ordered Mozz sticks app. About 10 min went by. Then 15, and I started wondering if they were brewing my beer behind the bar. As i sat there waiting for our drinks for about 20 min, I started noticing a few weird things about our waitress \"New Lisa\" as it said on our receipt. She was honestly acting like she had taken something the night before, or that morning who knows, and it was still in her system for sure. Seemed like she was just wandering around lost, every table she had was constantly asking for refills, their check, etc.... There was something way more wrong there than her just being \"new\".   When our food finally made it, she couldn't even remember who had ordered what out of all 2 OF US AT THE TABLE. And to top it all off the food was disgusting. Mozz sticks were obviously frozen,sauce had no flavor. I got chick parm stromboli, it came out soggy, somewhat cold, and just gross. My wife got the meat ravioli, she said they were ok, probably frozen as well,but the sauce they were buried in was pretty unbearable. I remember fresh ingredients from this place, no more.....  I don't know if something major has gone on here in the past 6 months or so, but I will never be back after this experience. When you have 2 full plates of food left sitting on the table, I literally took 2 bites, and no one says anything it speaks miles about the apathy of this restaurant., staff, & ownership.  Knowing its the same ownership group of  some other local favorites of mine, I will not be supporting any of their food until the issues are addressed and big changes are made. I will make sure everyone I know who has eaten at this restaurant is well aware of the type of service and food this establishment offers.  Excuse me while I morn the loss of one of my favorites.",

One other gripe: a place this local/friendly should not be rule ridden as to charge 75 cents for ranch! i mean come on.. don't nickel and dime, it puts a bad taste in our mouth. I always tip more and generally enjoy my experience more when a restaurant doesn't charge for an extra couple tablespoons of sauce/dressing!  that being said though, garlic knots are fab, and the pizza is very good.

It is my pet peeve when I get unopened mussels.  We had their Tuscan salad, which was perfect especially with our wine.  There was some homemade croutons in the salad, which were my favorite.  The pizza was hands-down one of the best in Charlotte.  Thin and crispy with an excellent base.  The slices on the large pie were truly that of a large pie.  We did a classic cheese with meatballs (SLICED heavenly meatballs, not that crumbly stuff) and a spinach pizza with just the right amount of garlic.  Waitstaff was friendly and warm.  It was causal, but upbeat.  Saw many having a good time at work, while really making sure all their tables were happy.   I can't wait to come back.

Their sausage &  pepperoni Sicilian takes a little while longer to make, but showcases the quality if their crust even better than the original.   If I had kids, I would totally buy their \"year's worth of pizza\" deal and make every Friday night dinner pizza night. I like it that much -- eating it once a week would be completely ok with me. Alas, I have no kids and am generally drinking somewhere on Fridays. I've only been there late at night, so I've yet to encounter the hordes of children said to down the dining room each evening.

In either case, the food has always been the shining star.  Recently, we found ourselves with 2 of our friends' kids on a Sunday at lunchtime and were wondering where we could satisfy both of their taste requirements and find something for us as well. Right away, I thought of Hawthorne's. It's very kid-friendly and delicious.  When we arrived, our drink orders were taken swiftly (it was before noon and the crowd hadn't begun to flood in yet). We bargained with our server for a super custom salad for our 4th grader (small house salad with added bacon, salami, huge shreds of cheddar cheese and ranch), and settled on a large cheese pizza for the rest of us.  When my young friend's salad arrived, I was astonished at how beautiful it was and she was completely thrilled with its ingredients. I don't know where they get their ranch dressing, but it was REALLY good.   As for the pizza, they double cut it so it would have small pieces for our 6-year-old. Flavor was perfect and texture was on point.   For a huge pizza, custom salad and soft drinks for everyone, we skated by with a $25 tab. Not too shabby, if you ask me! When I was consulting the table as to the proper tip amount, my 4th grade friend exclaimed, \"Give him 10! He got me an awesome salad!\"  We agreed.  Thanks, Hawthorne's. Home run.",

    "text": "Like others, I've lived in NYC & Chicago so trying to find the pizza place in CLT that will just hit the spot.  Hawthorne has great thin slices.  I love deep dish & would love if they had deep dish version.  The pizza is similar to NYC the large slices that for a single girl are easily considered a meal.  The service was spot on.  We'll give this another go & try the garlic knots.",

    "text": "Ah, this is good pizza... Pizza pizza!! I love how generous they get with their toppings. The pizza is huge, dough is fresh, as are the toppings. The only pizza I'm not a fan of here is the Buffalo Wings, but I've liked almost all other pizzas that I've tried here. My all time favorite is the Elizabeth Special. I never fail to order that, even if it has to be just one half. The other pizzas I would recommend are the Hawthorne's Special White, Meat Eaters, Crew and Ultimate Spinach. Their seating is pretty nice, the two times that I have dined in, we sat on the patio, which can get chilly on a cool day with the wind blowing, but is really nice on a warm summers day, especially if you have beer to go with it... Pizza and beer on a warm night, you can't go wrong with that! I like that they have a separate entrance for take-out because we usually just take our pizza to go and it's nice to have a little quiet seating while we wait on our pizza. They also have a couple game machines, although I've never actually tried them out. Parking is limited, but they recently added some extra parking spaces so it's better.",

Had to wait for new pizzas that were only slightly hotter and no adjustment was made to the check.  We won't be back and it's a shame because we've always liked this place.",

Also, ordered a craft beer which they warned me would be served in a 10 oz glass.  No way that \"juice\" glass was ten oz.  (we have juice glasses identical at home. Measured when I got home-8 oz at very best when filled to the lip...which my beer was not",

    "text": "Hawthorne's is by far one of the easiest calls for an afternoon group dining adventure. I have plenty of close friends with one thing in common: they all have droves of children. Kids can kick, scream, stomp, and cry their way to the dinner table, but the tears dry up when pizza is thrown into the mix. What kid doesn't want pizza?   This place is magnificent for kids. Plenty of games for them to \"think\" they are playing without actually shelling out any quarters for. The make-line window for the kids to watch is brilliant. A small platform with steps up to the glass lets kids watch to their heart's content.   As for the adults, plenty of draft, and local, brews and delicious pizza. The Sicilian is one of my favorites. Deep(er) dish pizza with a mix of meats and veggies. Throw on some of their buffalo sauce and you've got a flavorful party where all of your taste buds are invited.   Service is always snappy, patio is always hoppin' and the food is dependable. Thanks, Hawthorne's. You guys know what you're doing. Cheers!",
