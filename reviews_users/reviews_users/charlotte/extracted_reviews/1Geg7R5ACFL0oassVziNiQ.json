    "text": "Ended up here after other plans fell through and we are glad we did! We went on a sunny Sunday about noon and only had to wait around 10 minutes for a table. When you walk in you can see the open kitchen and and glass wall that allows customers to see crepes being made. The restaurant feels cozy and perfect for brunch. We enjoyed the ricotta and spinach crepe and the egg, cheddar, and veggie crepe both with buckwheat crepes. I was thrilled to see buckwheat crepes as an option on the menu, as I loved the savory buckwheat crepes I enjoyed in Paris earlier this year! The crepes were perfectly cooked, the fillings delicious and the portions huge! I look forward to going back to try a sweet crepe as well.  We also both ordered pumpkin chai lattes with soy milk, I found the drink cloyingly sweet and almost unpleasant to drink due to the sweetness. I would go back for a sweet crepe instead.",

    "text": "Had heard some good things about this place and was excited to check it out. I'm not the biggest fan of crepes, but thought it was cool that another creperie was opening in town.   Located on South Blvd, the parking can be a little hairy. You'll have to grab a meter or score a spot in one of the close garages. Not my ideal situation, but it's pretty cool that it's right off of the street. There is some outdoor seating with umbrellas which are nice, too. Always great to see the hustle and bustle on South during the day. The interior is pretty spacious. Plenty of tables and a small lounge area with some comfy chairs. Tons of natural light coming in their large windows, too. Very welcoming.   The open kitchen is a HUGE plus, too. Always fun to watch someone make crepes. Great for kids.   I had no idea when the menu held, so I went with the first sweet crepe on the menu. Maple Cream. This is where these guys lost it for me. It was a pretty standard crepe. Some whipped cream and fruit on the side. But....filled what was the equivalent of low-grade paper canister icing that you find in the grocery store. The worst part? There was SO MUCH of it. It was so overpoweringly sweet that I had to discard almost all of it for it to be slightly enjoyable. Really disappointing. Though, I think some of their savory crepes would be more enjoyable. Hoping to check those out next time.   I can't say I'll be rushing back it anytime soon, but these guys have a pretty cool setup. Really dig the open kitchen and think some of their concoctions are cool. Worth a shot, in my opinion. Just ask for LESS maple cream, should you venture down that road.",

Once you walk it, the staff noted you can sit anywhere you like. We wanted to be by the open kitchen to see how they prepare the crepes and waffles.  We ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Crepe and the Grilled Marinated Shrimp Crepe. Bother crepes was delicious. Large portions and perfect size for brunch, lunch or dinner. They did not have salmon crepes which was my favorite.  There were refills for coffee and tea. Staff checked to see if we wanted refills and water.  For those allergic to certain food make sure staff knows. My friend is allergic to onions and told waiter to remove out of crepe which they forgot when the crepe was brought out. Informed waiter again and they took care of it right away.  Will be back to try the sweet crepes the next time I am in the neighborhood.  As you walk out the door look out for bowl of water for the dog. Almost stepped into it.  Metered parking outside of the restaurant. Whole street on South Blvd is metered parking. Make sure you have coins available.",

It came with a generous-sized side item.  It was good.  I've had crepes where they are crunchy but this was more soggy and it required a fork.  It was like a big, greasy, doughy mess by the time I was half way in.  Just not the best in my opinion.  I didn't try any of the sweet crepes but they had quite a selection and a couple of them seem worth a 2nd try.  I won't hoof it over here again just to visit crispy crepe but if I'm in the area I am not opposed to giving them another shot.",

First big difference was that it wasn't the same, order and pay at the counter and we'll bring it to you sort of thing. This time, we were seated and had a server order our food and bring us our check, etc. This was definitely more relaxing.   This time they also had their patio poppin'. We ate outside at like 7:30 on a Thursday in July, the weather and ambiance was perfect.  I tried the Crispy Cheese crepe this time. Unfortunately it just tasted like a cheese quesidilla. It wasn't bad, just boring and lacking in texture. The menu says it's served with a grape tomato relish, but it really was just a couple sliced grape tomatoes with a vinaigrette. I got the black bean and corn salsa-like salad as my side... not good, not bad.   My boyfriend on the other hand, LOVED his crepe this time around. He ordered the Chipotle Chicken Crepe and was all about that thing. He ate every single bite and would totally order it again.   So, we'll definitely be back so my boyfriend can order the Chipotle Chicken Crepe again and I will still be on a quest to find a decent vegetarian crepe option here.",

    "text": "First, let me say that we entered the restaurant, but ended up not eating here for a couple of reasons.  We were passing through Charlotte on the way back to Asheville and were looking for a gluten-free option for food, before we hit the highway. We found Crispy Crepe through a Google search and Yelp directed us to their contact information and profile page on the Yelp website.  We called the restaurant to make sure they were still open. They were, as they close at 5 pm on Sundays. We made our way there, found parking, and proceeded to enter. It was before 5 pm, but the staff were already cleaning up, having mopped the floor with a strong cleaner, while people were still eating. It's my opinion that it is rude to mop a floor while people are eating. You impact the food smell, which is one aspect of the overall experience.  My wife is very sensitive to toxic chemicals, so we decided we'd do take out instead of dining in. When we stepped to the register, my wife asked about gluten-free options. The cashier had zero knowledge of what was gluten-free on the menu and what was not. She turned around to ask the person making the crepes and he was unsure if the sauce on one of the menu items contained gluten. It was clear that both employees lacked the knowledge or understanding of whether or not one of the crepes contained gluten.  From cleaning the restaurant with toxic chemicals (many restaurants are using green cleaners now) to having a passing interest in understanding their own menu, I was very disappointed with my first experience at Crispy Crepe. Fortunately, I live in Asheville, where they take these things seriously, instead of Charlotte, where it seems like there is little regard for people with both chemical and gluten sensitivities.  We ended up simply heading to Whole Foods to eat off the hot bar, because at least they list their ingredients and they don't clean around the food when you're trying to enjoy a meal.",

    "text": "Ok let me start by saying it was a living social coupon that got me in the door but i would be happy to return and pay regular price.  I saw the coupon and I checked yelp which i am prone to do and I saw the mixed reviews so I said what the heck i have a coupon if its horrible i don't have to go back.  Well me and my girlfriend were very happy we decided to give it a try.    I can only speak from my one experience but it was top notch.  We went around 2:30pm on a tuesday, there were about  2 or 3 other parties seated and it was not busy at all so we were seated immediately.  I ordered the smores latte and my girlfriend ordered the cookie butter latte, i am not much for warm drinks other than hot chocolate but i just wanted to try this and its was very very good.  My girlfriend is a coffee and espresso lover and she said she would come back just for these latte's in the future.  Waitress who was named jesse also brought us some waters without us asking which was very nice.  She did a very good job throughout our experience checking on us.   For our entrees I chose the chipotle chicken crepe and my girlfriend had the Mediterranean chicken crepe.  They were both exceptional and i am a picky eater to say the least, i would order either again.  I am not a crepe connoisseur so i can't speak for authenticity or anything else but i know good tasting food and this was it.  Portions were large we both had enough to take home and basically have a whole second meal later.  I could have finished mine but wanted to try a waffle for dessert.  The au gratin potatoes were similar to a hashbrown casserole, i added some siracha to mine and enjoyed them, my girlfriend said hers were good also and enjoyed hers plain.    For dessert we tried the cookie butter waffle, their \"liege\" style waffles with bananas whipped cream and this cookie butter stuff, it was sweet and decadent and very good. It is not gonna be a hot crispy and fluffy waffle so don't expect that or you will be disappointed, it is more dense and chewy but that is the way its suppose to be according to them and it was fine with me just know what your getting before you order it.      I don't leave reviews everywhere i go but this was a place that had mixed reviews and i was on the fence about trying but I'm very happy I did and we will go back for sure.  I can't comment on busy weekends or anything else but this tuesday afternoon was a pure delight!",

They have amazing hot drinks including a cookie butter latte. They have great breakfast crepes and most certainly wonderful dessert crepes. Before arriving I was already a huge fan of cookie butter and to see all the cookie butter inspired entrees I was in heaven!   They have both inside and outside seating available. The restaurant is not the largest so seating is a little cramped if you are 5 people. If you go on a weekend there will probably be a little wait time but it's worth it. You're in SouthEnd so enjoy the neighborhood :)   The wait staff was very helpful specially if it is your first time! They provided helpful hints and also offered us to go drinks on the way out! We will be back soon!",

He just said \"the chef left\" and that the person cooking the food wouldn't be able to fulfill my order. I've never had a problem with other restaurants having an issue with either taking the food off of my bill or letting me try something different, I mean none of those options were given to me. Especially if the customer barely touched their food. So that's just terrible customer service because if the customer isn't happy you should try everything to satisfy the customer. Long story short you guys need to take notes from HAZELNUT CREPERIE because they have the best crepes in charlotte & they're not soggy. They consistently have good crepes that are crispy with that being said y'all have poor customer service & the food sucks :) no wonder hazelnut creperie has better reviews than crispy crepe lol",

I tried placing a pick up order about 15 minutes before close last time. Called about 5 times with no answer. Arrived 8 minutes before close and two men said that they already closed for the day. I questioned them about the posted closing times to which they responded that it was a few minutes before close and they were done for the day. I told them I had been trying to call in a pick order with no answer and they were just like \"oh.\" Then this current time they were out of waffles by 11am...  Original Review::: Love this place. The European waffles are just like the gofres in Spain! The Shwarma Lamb pita is a force to be reckoned with. Great for brunch and regular lunch. Haven't had a bad meal here yet. So glad this place exists here in Charlotte.",

Even though they have tons of other stuff - sandwiches, waffles, salads - there are two pages of crepes on the menu - one of savories and one of sweets. Tough to choose!  After our waiter brought us two swimming pool sized cups of coffee, we chose one sweet crepe (the Apple Streusel) and one savory (the Crispy, which is cheese stuffed). Both took a little bit to be prepared, during which the coffee was refilled. Good coffee, btw. Even though they have lattes and cappuccinos and other 'elite' coffees, you can't go wrong with a cup of Joe here.  Both plates arrived looking excellent as you can see from the pictures. The apple crepe was massive and quite sweet. The \"Crispy crepe\" was excellent. Tons of cheese and lots of flavor. I think I made out better for having that one. Oh, and the side of potatoes? Heavenly!  Plenty of parking in the parking deck behind the restaurant or on the street if you can find it.",

During my visit I endulged in the Cannoli Crepe ( pretty delishnessous) and the chedder and veggie crepe. The chedder and veggie was much healthier, but hey you gotta mix it up to keep them LB's off. The crispy crepe has healthy options and endulgence.  If I'm looking for a crepe or some waffles I'll will return.",

With that being said, they are only open for breakfast and lunch, no dinner!    Since everything is freshly made to order, be patient with the amount of time it takes for your food to come out.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish they were open later and the prices aren't low, but I understand it's because of the quality that is put into it... I do appreciate a good crepe though!  They do offer gluten free crepes for those who prefer it.",

We ordered the Pecorino chicken and Bruschetta crepes and split them between ourselves. We both had the little hummus with cilantro side. We really enjoyed our food!!  I can truly say it was better than I expected. This was my first time eating at a crepe place....my husband's second. He said he enjoyed his crepes at Crispy Crepe better than another place he'd tried. I also thought the meal was filling. Although my mouth was salivating at the dessert crepe that was being served at the table beside us, I was too full to order dessert. I am so glad we took a chance on a Groupon deal for this or we probably wouldn't have known it existed. The atmosphere was relaxing and consequently we were very comfortable and enjoyed the evening at Crispy Crepe immensely. We would definitely go back.",

A good time to go is during lunch, surprisingly. There isn't much of a crowd. I am a fan of the bruchetta crepe. It's got a lot of flavor and texture and is very filling. My favorite is the roasted eggplant flatbread. It's served like a pizza pie, big enough to share for two. Packed with so much flavor it'll rock your senses. I'm already craving it as I type this out. Definitely don't leave without trying a dessert crepe. Can't go wrong with any of them but anything Nutella always hits the spot. They also offer gluten-free crepes, so that's a plus for those seeking that option. Oh, and, try to be seated as far away from the kitchen area as possible or you'll walk out smelling like grease.",

We both had savory dishes with-- the Chipotle Chicken being really tasty. Per the menu it consists of \"Cumin crusted chicken slices topped with pico de gallo, jack cheese, sliced avocado & chipotle cream\" and comes with a side orzo pasta salad.  All of these ingredients worked well together and tasted fresh.  I also tried a Caramel Macchiato. Although I could taste the caramel and hints of vanilla, I will ask for maybe an extra shot of espresso. It was a little weak for my tastes. Service was decent and the owners seemed nice and asked if all was good. Prices are moderate. We will have to come back and try some of the sweeter choices.",

    "text": "Crispy Crepe is in the heart of the South End (one of my favorite areas in Charlotte) and I am a sucker for outdoor seating.  My bestie and I thought we'd try something new so Crispy Crepe it was.  I was really excited after reviewing the menu, but I couldn't decide if I wanted sweet or savory so I ordered the Smoked salmon, egg and herb goat cheese Crepe and my friend ordered the Cookie Butter Waffle and we split each dish to satisfy our palette.  The food was delicious HOWEVER the service was not the best.  We chose to sit outside since it was a beautiful day. The waitress was prompt in coming to our table, explaining the menu and the food arrived to our table in a timely manner.  Towards the end of our meal, another waitress arrives to our table and aggressively says \"So are you guys ready for your check or what?\"  I was a little taken back by her tone and the fact that she was coming to our table without announcing why she was coming to our table at all.  It gave me the impression that she was rushing us and not to mention she was rude.  I guess my expression said everything because she quickly corrected herself explaining that our waitress was occupied and sent her over to ask if we were ready for our checks.  I think it's important to teach your staff the importance of tone and delivery.  It's not what you say but how you say it.  That one incident partially spoiled my overall brunch experience...nevertheless the food was good and I still recommend trying Crispy Crepes.",

The waitress implied that the sweet crepes were not large enough to be a full meal, but I was pleasantly supposed at how big my maple crush cheesecake crepe was. It Totally filled me up. There was definitely too much maple cream filling but everything else was perfect. It even came with a chocolate covered strawberry and dollop of whipped cream. My friend got the bruschetta crepe and seemed equally pleased with her choice. Service was superb and we were taken care of very well. The prices seem a little steep, esp for the sweet crepes that don't have any meat in them, so I took off one star, but I am already craving another crepe and will definitely be back. It also looks like they do call ahead and pick up as I saw one girl walk up with her dog and hand her credit card to a server outside who then returned with a to go bag for her. Being within walking distance to all the southend apts is a plus.",

The waitress took the waffle away and my daughter ordered a bacon/cheese croissant. The server said that the waffle couldn't be removed from the check, so we were charged for a waffle that was not edible and a dry and stale bacon cheese croissant that she couldn't eat. We asked to speak to a manager and the owner came over to the table and said that he was sorry and that was it!!! Over $50 of LESS than average food, which half of it was not edible..we will not be back!",

    "text": "Mixed experience at best - I debated giving two stars. I don't plan on returning.  Pros: My gluten-free buckwheat crepe was quite tasty and the filling had fresh, properly cooked ingredients. Even eggs were perfectly done and the arugula was unbruised. When I needed help, the manager was great.  Cons: Sides were meh. The au gratin that my husband had apparently tasted like it came from a frozen foods section, not a restaurant.  However, service was the real problem.  1) Weeks before eating here, I walked in to discuss gluten-free options when I happened to be in the area. I was told that they do gluten-free orders frequently (as you'd expect since they carry a gluten-free crepe batter) and was told that they can make anything on the menu without gluten! This sounded too good to be True but the hostess insisted that this was the case. Of course, it isn't True, and I have no idea why she said so.  2) When I visited, they nearly gave up our table because they couldn't find us when it was ready. Where were we? Sitting in the waiting chairs right in front of them! Thank goodness one of our party went up to check up on them. Again, I have no idea why this happened.  3) The waitress had a remarkable amount of trouble understanding my gluten-free order. I'd ask a question about whether an item was gluten-free, and she'd respond by saying something about the item that had nothing to do with whether it contains gluten. This went on for several menu items until she started to say something about how they didn't really do gluten-free crepes and that maybe I should look at other menu items, which of course is not True and I have no idea why she said it. We finally asked for her to get a manager or chef to recommend gluten-free options. When the manager came, he was great at answering my questions and making basic allergy accommodations the way most restaurants do. Now, while it's a bit silly for a server not to know which items are gluten-free in a restaurant that's gone to the trouble of having a special gluten-free crepe batter, I don't really have a problem with a server not having all that memorized. The problem was that she wasn't offering to help us figure things out or check and, indeed, she didn't seem to understand basic questions well enough to give an on-topic answer! Yet again, I have no idea what was going on with that.",

The first time i got the Smoked Turkey with White Stilten Cranberry Cheese which was great. I do wish that there had been less caramelized onions on the sandwiches but it was all together great. The real star of that meal was my mom's Basil Grilled Chicken Sandwich. It was fantastic. We got this in October when she moved me into my apartment and seriously still talks about this sandwich like it was god's gift to earth. It was a great sandwich and i'd definitely get it next time i go in for lunch. The second time i went i got the Egg 'n' Turkey Bacon Waffle Platter with overeasy eggs and a side of the potatoes. The potatoes are good but very very cheesy. They were a bit much for me and i LOVE cheese. My eggs were runny which was really disappointing. The waffle was good but very dry. I felt that i needed to drench it in syrup to be completely happy with it. Both of my friends got crepes and loved their meals. I think that i've learned my lesson to stick with the crepes next time.",

We sat down and were immediately greeted. I ordered the cookie butter latte with soy milk and my boyfriend ordered a caramel macchiato. Mine was delicious. He didn't like his at all but the waitress happily offered another drink instead. He ordered the smores latte and liked it much better.   For our meals, he had the waffle, eggs and turkey bacon. He really liked it, especially the potatoes. I had the veggie crepe with cheddar cheese instead of goat cheese (and no hummus). Now, when I ordered it, I had a ton of hesitation just because it is unlike things I normally order. However, I was blown away! The garlic oil drizzled on top was amazing. My boyfriend also really liked it, which says a lot because he typically likes meals full of meat. The only thing that was just ok to me were the potatoes. Now, again my boyfriend really liked them. I thought they were tasty, but I wish they were served at a warmer temperature.   Overall, it was really good. We will return.",

Even so, we were seated in a little under 30 minutes. I got the cheese crepe with turkey bacon and my fiancee got the smoked salmon and goat cheese crepe. Both were delicious!  And the must have of the experience: the cookie butter latte! Do not pass up this treat! The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is the price was a bit high. Even so, we shall return.",

We were there on a beautiful Saturday, right before the brunch busy time, however we got seated on the patio pretty quickly! Service was quick and the food was good.   Per usual, I was so indecisive and had trouble deciding between a savory or sweet crepe. But alas, my sweet tooth always wins out and I got the cookie butter waffle and added strawberries! They were a nice touch, but be careful because it adds like $2.00! The waiter offered, so I agreed to add them. Be careful of those trickster \"add ons.\" The hubs made me feel glutenous by ordering the healthy egg and veggie cheddar crepe. However, it was definitely nice to have a choice between sweet and savory. His was delicious, and the veggies give the color quite a pop!",

    "text": "After spotting Crispy Crepe driving down South Blvd where all the new condos/apartments are, we decided to give it a shot this past Sunday morning.  Being Sunday morning, we were afraid there would be a long wait, but we gave it a shot anyway.  Fortunately, although the restaurant was busy, there was a table for us!  Since it was a beautiful day, it would have been nice to have sat at one of their covered tables on the sidewalk, but they were already all taken (another time then!).    For being where it is, the restaurant is a decent size, and the interior with the big glass windows and modest decor give it a very cheerful, welcoming, clean feel.    I've never been that crazy about the open kitchen concept, but it wasn't bothersome for breakfast.  I guess I'm just one of those people who'd rather see and feel the ambiance of a dining room (especially when I'm dining OUT) than try to eat a meal in the throes of the kitchen where the chefs and servers are buzzing about.    Crispy Crepe has a lot of lunch items but not as many breakfast choices as I was hoping, especially with the crepes.  There's only a couple of basic egg options.  So, with the promise of our table sharing one of the many, many dessert crepe choices (dessert for breakfast? yikes!), I went with the Egg 'n' Turkey Bacon Waffle Platter (with au gratin potatoes) so I could taste of variety of items during my first visit.  Everything was delicious.  The potatoes were really creamy and cheesy (not greasy).  I hoped they were fresh instead of from a package, but I couldn't be too sure.  The waffle was definitely a highlight.  It's called a Liege Waffle, which I've never had before.  It was very dense, but full of a lot of flavor that regular waffles don't have.  It stayed very crispy, too, even with the real maple syrup on it.    At the end of the meal, we all split a Banofie Crepe, which was a giant crepe filled with bananas and a butterscotch custard.  It tasted similar to Bananas Foster.  The crepe itself was light and delicious.    Lastly, I must note the coffee.  It tasted good and came in a BIG cup.  I always appreciate restaurants with big coffee cups so I'm not waiting for a server to come around often to keep refilling my tiny cup/mug.  I only had to have one refill this time around (but our super-friendly and efficient server came around a lot anyway).    Will we be back?  You betcha.",

I am so glad we did!  Like many of my other reviews say...don't go to a steakhouse and review the chicken.  Enough said...get the crepes.    Which one should I get?  I got the Apple Streusel Crepes.  Made from fire-roasted apples in a cinnamon caramel sauce, some creme fraiche, candied walnuts and a delicious crumble...you can't go wrong here.  Sooooo good!  As for the service and ambiance...you'll be fine.  In fact, the service is nice and so is the ambiance of the place.  Might get a tad warm...so take off your jacket.

It was busy, but took really long to get seated--about thirty minutes.  Given the simplicity of preparing the crepes, the rose itself took a long time to get to us.  Server was very detailed and repeated our order but still got the sides wrong--mine on buddy's plate and vice versa. She was nice so I can't knock her for that.  The crepes themselves were tasty an very filling.  The berry shake though, is where it's at!  Still coming back here bc the shake was so good... Did I tell you how good the shake is here?  dmo out.",

Living close by my friend and I decided to give it a try. I take it that most of their clientele isn't tattooed and pierced. I heard the owner describe me to our server and say, \"this isn't the place for those people with their tattoos\" I hated to break it to them, it's Southend not South Park.",

    "text": "Expensive, seems like portion wise they give you more for the savory crepes rather than sweet. The maple crunch crepe was pretty small, and heavy. Sole kind of cream looking thing inside of it that looks like ice cream. Not a very healthy option for sure but great if you have a sweet tooth. Not really worth $10.75 if you ask me, and not very filling.  The smoked salmon goat cheese egg crepe was surprisingly pretty good. Unfortunately the smoked salmon would have been better if they cook crepe first and then add it in to still keep the cold smoked texture, rather the salmon in the crepe is cooked. You get to choose a side with this crepe..some options were fruits(honey dew, sweet melon and pineapple slices), kettle chips etc  Pretty sparse for 10am but it started getting busy around 11. Overall i feel like there are better crepe places out there that are more economical. I am not a big fan of spending more than necessary just for the hype",

Like Bananas and Carmel, apples or strawberries, you pick the combo or select from delicious options and you will be sure to be pleased.  They have waffles that are so rich and delicious. I don't recommend that as your meal. (Too heavy) But share one at your table. A few bites and you will be wondering where they have been all your life!   Their specialty drinks are so good and their Salads at lunch are yummy too!  I've never had a bad meal.  Service varies, we've hit the jack pot a few times and often are left disappointed.   They have indoor or outdoor seating and are conveniently located in south end. There's a parking deck down the alley behind the restaurant.   If you haven't been try it out :)",

Everything looked good so I went with the chipotle chicken while the bf ordered the Mediterranean chicken crepe. Crepes are a little over 10 bucks here, kinda pricey. Crepes came out fast and wow, they are big. We should have split one. The Au gratin side was Delish! I was disappointed to find the chipotle chicken was very bland. I didn't even get a hint of chipotle. But, everything was fresh! The Mediterranean chicken was so bomb though! The sauce included in this is so flavorful! Some chicken pieces felt off and a little chewy. Had to box up both crepes, they were so big we couldn't finish!   We will be back for more, but, well be splitting a savory and getting a sweet. The cookie butter sounded enticing. Having a crepe to yourself is just too much food. Cheers!",

The potatoes were not 'au gratin', they were more like mashed pototatoes, but with some salt and pepper they were fine.  My boyfriend ordered the peanut butter and chocolate chip crepe, which was really yummy...probaby too sweet for a breakfast, but something we would probably go back and split for a dessert.  And as some other reviewers have mentioned, there doesn't seem to be proper ventilation from the kitchen, the whole place is kind of hazy and full of smoke from the kitchen. Sit outside if you can, at least until they install some overhead vents for their open kitchen.  We'll probably give this place another chance...but we'll see.",

    "text": "DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.     I just recently went here last Thursday around 10am to an uncrowded restaurant.  My server approached my friend and I to get our drink orders and seemed to be kind of in a rush to get back to her circle of server friends/breakfast eating at a table in plain sight at the back of the restaurant.  We both ordered the waffles with peppered turkey bacon selection, hastily as not to ruin my server's busy social life. I added a $3 topping choice to my waffle of strawberries and nutella, JUST strawberries and nutella nothing else. Our food arrived in a decent time, but was completely unseasoned and not necessarily appetizing. Our eggs were a little undercooked, which happened to be fine with me but not my friend. Our potatoes that were scooped from a steam well lacked flavor completely. Our COLD waffles possessed a yeasty almost raw taste(which we were later told is a common complaint among diners, and yet they haven't tried to fix it) and mine was topped with an excessive amount of whipped cream and chocolate syrup in addition to the strawberries and nutella,  that I hadn't ordered. It was pretty, but unwanted. And for this to be an open kitchen the line cook could have been a little more inviting to watch prepare our food. In an open kitchen, you're on display and most times people's entertainment for their meal. However, don't worry our server only popped back in enough to quickly see if we were ready for dessert(as if I could stomach that with the heaping pile of whipped cream I had on my waffle, nice selling tactic though) and for the check. I felt as though we were some what neglected,  until I noticed the table next to us barely be attended and then stumble across an error in their bill because they were trying to use a Groupon. I don't know the full situation, but their server kindly handed the situation over to who I assume was the manager who stood behind the counter the entire time and never cared to check on this table or anyone else, but the lady didn't seem to get her problem resolved. When she walked back to her seat she was confronted by her server explaining to her it was \"corporate's\" fault. I do have to admit that wasn't my burden to harbor, but the management team seems to be lacking severely here for letting their service team get away with what they do. The servers need to actually act like they like to work there, regardless if they do or not. I feel as though I paid A LOT of money to be pissed off and unhappy with this place. I didn't even bother getting our server to comp anything(not that I think they would after reading reviews on here) or to speak with the manager (if she should be so bothered). Its not like me to write reviews of places further than giving the stars, but I'd like to let people know DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME,  MONEY, OR ENERGY TO GO HERE!",

    "text": "This place is okay. We didn't wait long for a table but we did wait to get our drink order taken, and then about 20 minutes for our food, which was one crepe and one cinnamon waffle. Our waitress was busy I guess because she didn't seem to check on us often, and she didn't really speak up which she needed to do because that place is loud.   I got my waffle and wanted a steak knife to cut through it. I remember going to a waffle place that had waffles like these before, and they were done in 5 minutes and I didn't need a sharp knife to cut through them. So this waffle wasn't my favorite waffle. On my list of favorite waffles it comes in right under that weird store brand frozen waffle I bought one time because there was a picture of a meadow on the box. In retrospect what does a meadow have to do with waffles? I don't know.   My friend didn't like the coffee but my frozen mocha smoothie was pretty alright. He got a gyro crepe and said it was basically a salad stuffed into a crepe. The potatoes au gratin were pretty good though.   One thing I didn't like was the lack of sides you could order. I figure you can order sides, but it would have been nice to see what was available instead of having to rely on the soft spoken waitress who I could not hear.",

It kind of has a cheap feel to it once inside. Maybe it was the website and pictures that made me have higher expectations.  I ordered one of their specialties - the maple cream crepe. It was okay, but way overpriced at $10. My friend drinks coffee (I don't). She had to ask for another latte, because there were coffee grinds in her drink. When she got the new latte she said, \"I think the coffee is just bad here.\" I didn't have any issues with the food taking a long time or it being crowded. There is another crepes place in NoDa (farther from me in South Charlotte) that I think is better.   Bottom line: Sounds like it would be great, but very lackluster and not worth going.",

Everything was fresh with good intentions but a commitment to one particular item means it has to be special.  It certainly was not special.    The decorating is a bit awkward and appears unfinished.   Our food runner was very pleasant though a bit nervous.  I was still hungry when I left.  More calories burned chewing than ingested.

The portions are so tiny for what you pay for. I ordered the 'special' of pumpkin spice crepes and they tasted good. The problem was I was starving when I left the restaurant. Aside from that, there was no price attached to the 'special.'  Come to find out it costs almost $15. Long story short breakfast cost almost $35 for two people and I felt like I had been had this last time. Batter and cream cheese and the effort to make it doesn't cost nearly what they charge. This used to be the only 'creperie' in town but now there are plenty others who I feel offer better food and quality of service for the price you pay. Plus South End in general has grown up a lot since the inception of this place and I feel like they need to grow up with the area too. Someone mentioned brunch was dead on a Sunday at 10am and that should be prime time for this place. That statement alone speaks volumes. Parking is also a pain at this place as a side note.

Little did I know, I was being charged 1/2 for the crepe I sent back and full price for the replacement crepe - I was NOT informed of this when I placed another order.  I received my bill as I was starting to eat my second crepe as my entire family was finished with their food.  Once I saw the charge, I sent the other crepe back with only 2 bites taken and told them I would pay for none of them.  The manager stated she was sorry I was not told about paying for both crepes, but she didn't remove them from the bill.  Basically, I was being charged for 1.5 crepes and I took 3 bites total.  The second crepe was actually very good, but I sent it back on the principal that I should only have to pay for 1 crepe especially when I was not satisfied with the first one and the server was the one who recommended the crepe that was horrible.  After arguing, the manager removed both items from my bill.  I left the restaurant hungry and very unhappy.  I will never come back.   I have never heard of a restaurant trying to charge people for bad food that is sent back - it tells me that they don't stand behind their food which is crazy since that is their business.  Do not go to the Crispy Crepe!!!!!",

It used to to be more of a self service and order at the register type place but now it appears to be full service and sit down.  We ordered two crepes - one sweet and one savory and split the two which was absolutely perfect portions and flavors.  The Mediterranean crepe is like a Greek salad with chicken in a crepe and was very tasty and an interesting blend of flavors.  The Bonafie crepe was absolutely amazing with butterscotch and bananas.  Every bite was just the perfect amount of sweet and crispy and so tasty.   The service was attentive and prompt.  Using the Living Social coupon ($10 for $20) and leaving a $5 tip was an incredible deal of $15 total for two adults to eat some excellent food with great service.  I would highly recommend this place especially if you can each get a sweet and savory crepe and split them.  The parking is past the restaurant down at the bottom of the building in the garage.  It may be a little tricky if you've never been to that building before but it's still a very short walk to the restaurant.",

I really wanted to grab a crepe from here too (because it's part of their name!), but couldn't justify adding another $12 to my tab when I was already going to be full from the other stuff. Anyhow, the food was it to me within 5-10 minutes of me ordering. And it looked exactly as picture on the menu!  Since when does that happen?!?!  Cheese & eggs scrambled well, hash brown casserole, turkey bacon, and of course the waffle. I think the attached picture just about says it all, but everything was done to perfection. Eggs were a little small on the portion size but they were good. Next was the hashbrown casserole that had cheese in it. Besides needing a little salt, it was awesome! Turkey bacon was thick cut and full of flavor. And the dough-based waffle was very much dessert for my breakfast. It was larger than expected and the texture was great. I'm not a big fan of whip cream so I could've done without that and I don't eat strawberries so I gave away the chocolate-dipped strawberry that was on top. But the food here was as good as I could ask for. The waitress was friendly and helpful in helping my decide what to get. They are not \"cheap\" but as long as you come in knowing that, you won't be surprised/disappointed by pricing. I checked the menu online before dropping in. There was free 3hr garage parking in the back (no validation required) for restaurant customers. Would highly recommend to anyone without hesitating. Good job Crispy Crepe, good job!",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try out Crispy Crepe since it opened, and finally made it there yesterday.  First off, let me say that the service was great.  Our server was very friendly and offered several great suggestions.    I started with the ham and cheddar crepe (not sure if that is the actual name).  It honestly tasted just like a ham and cheese hot pocket.  Although I really like those hot pockets, and the crepe was good, I probably wouldn't order it again.  I would rather buy the $2.00 hot pocket from HT than the $7.99 crepe.  My fiancee got the chipotle chicken flat bread and said it was very good.  We ended the night with the peanut butter chocolate crepe.  Do yourself a favor and get this crepe.  It was delicious.  It had melted peanut butter cups that just oozed out when you cut into it, and mixed with the chocolate drizzle.  It was served with some whipped cream that was just ok and a chocolate covered strawberry.  I honestly want another one right now.  So, overall a good experience.  I'm definitely going to go  back.  There menu us pretty big and several options looked tasty.  Be careful about sitting outside.  Although it was a nice spot, we were annoyed by numerous flies the entire meal.",

    "text": "I've been here twice.  The first time I ordered the waffle and I thought it was good, not great.  It had the lovely caramelized sugar nuggets that we all love, but I thought the waffle itself was a bit dense.   Before I gave it a review, I wanted to give it a fair shot and order the restaurant's namesake, a crepe.  I'm so glad I went back!  The crepe was phenomenal!!!  I ordered the gyro crepe and was very happy.  The portion was huge and the filling was great.  It's something I honestly don't know if you'll be able to find anywhere else in Charlotte.  For dessert I got the S'Mores crepe to take home to my husband.  Once we started eating it, I realized I should've ordered two!  Again, excellent.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this place 5 stars was the slight disappointment in the original waffle.  I'll definitely be returning and ordering more crepes.",

    "text": "I'm surprised that this is the second review since I've already been there 3 times. Oddly, I still haven't tried a dessert crepe!  This new place in SouthEnd next to My Townhome is well located and a good spot to get a meal or a snack.  Our favorite dishes are the chipotle chicken crepe, the eggplant tartine (delish!) and caramelized waffles. The tartine came with a melange of roasted veggies including more eggplant that was awesome and I think I would like to have that as the side with everything (even though the orzo salad was great too). My friend enjoyed her portobello grilled cheese panini. The lemon peppered chicken crepe left a bit to be desired, and I wish that they had a creamy chicken and mushroom one like the delicious ones at Cafe Monte, or a shrimp artichoke one.   They make crepes on site in front of you so it actually is a bit smoky in there, so they need to keep the door open or figure out the ventilation a bit better.  They didn't do too much with the upfit, so I think they could get a little more creative to make it feel more cozy.  But I look forward to returning and trying the salads and dessert crepes or chocolate dipped strawberries!",

    "text": "My husband and I have probably been to Crispy Crepe over 10 times.  They see us coming and greet us with \"welcome back\"  at this point.  I have tried quite a few menu items but the Cookie Butter Waffle is my favorite.  The waffles have a yeast flavor (not our American type waffles.. read about the caramelizing pearl sugar, non-bromated flour, etc. on the CC site).  It is served with the Biscoff European Cookie Butter, whipped cream, bananas, and topped with a chocolate covered strawberry.  :)  It is just big enough to leave me satisfied, but not stuffed!  The waffles are not huge, but are thick, Belgian-style.  The Bruschetta (add chicken) or Caesar Crepe (I forget the actual name) are both wonderful.  My husband enjoys the eggs, turkey bacon, waffle and gratin potato dish, but does wish they offered regular bacon. (Not turkey bacon fans). He also enjoys their sandwiches.  My vegetarian son loves a lot of their dishes, crepes, and coffees.  The owner is very nice and on Mother's Day (after eating a large lunch at Cowfish) I wanted a Cookie Butter Waffle that evening.  They treated us like royalty and even brought me out a flower for Mother's Day (my second of the day).  I thought that was very considerate.  The interior is very European (reminds me a lot of Cafe Monte in SouthPark, if you have been there.. very French).  Outside patio seating is available.  Parking is in the rear in a HUGE (free) garage for those of you who are having a problem with that.  We had one slow waiter experience, which we over looked since they were in training, and one take out apple/brie crepe that was not so hot.. (eat these crepes while they ARE crispy)... not so hot for take out, as they do lose their crispness in a take out container.  I have never minded the kitchen (it is glassed off from the main dining area & I enjoy seeing them at work), and our food is always hot from a heating lamp they use to keep the entire meal hot while getting it ready to bring to the table at one time.    I have not yet tried the salads, but they look fantastic.  They do gluten-free dishes, also.  While I usually eat gluten free, I have found I can eat these waffle with the non-bromated flour without problems.  I will definitely be continuing to visit Crispy Crepe for my Cookie Butter Waffle fix! :)",

    "text": "Since Crispy Crepe is near my apartment complex, I was so excited for its opening. My first visit there was a late weekday. I ordered the Turkey Fontina sandwich, which was decent. Very average flavors despite its description. The \"gourmet salad\" was incredibly underwhelming. It consisted of chickpeas and some sparse feta vegetable-ish stuff. I ordered a croissant for the morning but they were out. To compensate, they included some chocolate strawberries. Nice touch! Definitely the highlight of the meal. Thank God that strawberry is in their logo.   Ok, so the first meal 3/5 but then again... I didn't try their specialty. Armed for round two, I checked Yelp for recommendations. Despite some of the other reviews, I got myself a crepe for dinner tonight. Crispy Crepe? More like Chewy Crepe. You guys are right! The crepe was doughy, thick, and TOUGH. I couldn't bite into it, let alone cut it with a fork and knife. I ordered the Chocolate Chip Cannoli Crepes which called for ricotta filling and chocolate chips. Honestly, the filling felt cheap and almost offensive. The ricotta filling was thin and granular with no hint of ricotta. It was like they were trying to pull a fast one. I would have much rather walked across the street and gotten a real one from Nova's. The crepes came with a side of fruit in the same soupy creme. And my chocolate covered strawberry--the star of my previous meal--was partially mushy.  This sealed the deal. I wanted to like Crispy Crepe. I really did! The owner is such a nice man, and the staff is very accommodating. However, for a more expensive lunch joint, I need better quality and substance.",

    "text": "I survived college partially on a diet of strawberry-nutella crepes, so I wanted to give this place a shot. I went for Brunch by myself on a Sunday and it was a pretty mixed bag. I might have been more forgiving if they opened pretty recently...?  Pros: 1. I snagged a spot in the garage behind the building - there are some reserved spots for this restaurant specifically, for one hour. 2. I immediately got seated outside, and when the sun came out (and some other people left) they indulged my request to move to another table under 1 of their 2 umbrellas. 3. Due to their slow service, they brought me a side of fruit and didn't charge me for my tea (I happened to notice it on my check, they didn't point it out to me).  4. I had the Apple Streusel Crepes and it was DELICIOUS. Seriously. The chocolate covered strawberry was a bonus, but I housed that whole freaking thing. It was a meal in & of itself.  Cons: 1. I sat for 10+ minutes before I was approached by a waitress. My entire meal (1 savory crepe for 1 person + iced tea) took 1.5 hours.  I don't know if they're not used to having an outside section since it's been rainy? I assume they're the same level of busy every Sunday. 2. My waitress, Ariel, was not at all friendly. I wouldn't go as far as rude, and I would love to make an excuse for her as it seemed hectic, but I never got told the specials, had to ask for tea refills, and generally felt like I was putting her out somehow.  Overall, I would go back to explore more of their menu, but probably not sitting outside (which sucks, I love to bring my dog and eat outside). I have heard a few other comments from friends (which put the craving in my head!) that some of the menu items are definitely misses.  Mine was hit so it gets 3 stars!",

Our waitress asked if we're sharing and served us each half. Thank goodness because it was stuffed and would have been a mess trying to divide it. We had to get a sweet crepe so decided to split the Apple.....oh my!!!  That hit the spot...yes sweet but don't put sugar in your coffee because I wldnt have them change a thing.

The omelette was one of the best I've ever had: light, fluffy,  flavorful. A side of toast and fruit came with the omelette and both were delicious.  The crepes, however,  were so crispy they required two hands to pull apart.  The knife provided was no match for the toughness of the crepe.  If you're accustomed to softer crepes,  stick with the omelettes and waffles.",

Perfect so that everyone can get what they are craving. I got the Herbed Ricotta Cheese and Spinach crepe. It had a ricotta and sun-dried tomato mixture inside with parmesan cheese, herbs, and fresh spinach with a roasted red pepper pesto on top. I ordered the potatoes as a side. It was such a good breakfast and I was not disappointed. The crepe was so big I was unable to finish the whole thing. My boyfriend got the chocolate peanut butter waffle which was also amazing.

I would have taken pics, but the food looks as it should. It's just how hard it was.   I called the restaurant back to tell them about what happened. The owner apologized and said he'd make me new food if I brought back the original order. I am unable to do so, and asked for a refund. He said no. I didn't even bother arguing, I just hung up. I understand businesses need to make money, but if you're delivering subpar food, at least be willing to make your customer happy by refunding them. Food went to the trash. I won't be going back.",

The caffe mocha was awesome, a great way to start your morning.   Crepe wise, my wife & I split it chipotle chicken & the picorini (think Cesar salad) crepes. Both were delicious and I'd easily recommend them. The cheesy potato side great flavor & texture, and the side salad was probably the best \"side\" salad I've had at any restaurant. Their house dressing was almost like a pesto, and it was fantastic.   I cannot wait to head back to this joint and try one of their authentic Belgian waffles.",

    "text": "Having eaten here several times since February 2019 to today, it almost seems like they're cutting corners to save money, and as a result, quality isn't what it should be - especially for the prices charged. My husband ordered the Mediterranean crepe today. He said the chicken tasted like canned chicken mush, and the feta had next to no flavor. I ordered an English Breakfast tea today and got something that was comparable to Lipton. Blech! It wasn't the same higher-quality tea from a previous visit. As for food, I usually play it safe with eggs and turkey bacon. I'd never had turkey bacon before, but this bacon is definitely on the tough side. It would be nice to have more options than turkey bacon or turkey sausage. I tried a waffle the last two visits, and again, I'd never had this style of waffle. They describe it as dense, and the waffle definitely lives up to the description. You could give someone a concussion with that thing! Today's waffle wasn't just dense, but it was also incredibly tough. It was a challenge to cut it! Overall, I thought the Crispy Crepe was an okay place to eat breakfast the first time I was there, but not so much now. There are just way better places to go for breakfast.",

I got the apple streusel and it tasted like a warm little apple pie wrapped up in a crepe. SO GOOD. My friend got the cookie butter crepe and the bananas perfectly compliment the cookie butter as not to make it too too sweet. My boyfriend ended up with the chipotle chicken crepe as it was pretty close to lunch at this point. As someone who was skeptical about crepes and had actually never had one, he loved It and was excited to eat his leftovers later that day.   The service was really quick! We were quoted half an hour wait for 3 people but only waited about 15. After we ordered, our food took maybe 10 minutes to receive and not much longer to devour! I would most definitely come here again for breakfast/brunch!",

The waffle was thick and had a good flavor to it. I ordered egg whites and they were a bit oily. Why I am giving three stars, because there was little ventilation inside so the smoke from the food was getting to me and another person was coughing loudly and I assume it was because of the smoke as well. Also the service was very weak. I felt bad because it seemed to be one waiter- he was trying to serve all the tables and running around. Lastly, I would NOT recommend one of the smoothies. It tasted water based and it was expensive for what it was. I'm not sure if I'd be back, but I'm definitely glad I gave it a try.",

    "text": "My wife and live near here and keep seeing the sign, so we decided to check it out for breakfast one Sunday morning.  We were surprised by the larger size of the interior (more of a diner/cafe than a crepe shop).  We each got the Egg, Waffle, Turkey Bacon plate with their au gratin potatoes... I upgraded to the Nutella and Strawbery crepe and she upgraded to the cookie butter crepe (with brule'd bananas).  The good: Service:  The hostess and our waiter were both friendly, professional and polite.  Great staffing choice. Cleanliness:  It's an open kitchen and they keep it spotless.  The tables and floors were all in good shape. Most of the food:  The potato dish was delicious.  Our eggs were cooked exactly as we ordered them.  The flavors in the crepes were great (good combinations) and the fruit was fresh and flawless.  The presentation (minus the plate, see below) was beautiful.  The OK: The turkey bacon was odd, as most turkey bacon is.  It was more like small strips of pressed ham... grilled nicely, but still just odd.  Some real bacon would have been so much nicer. The giant plate looked straight from a 1990s era cooking school.  The food seemed to get lost on dish that might have served better as a carving tray in many restaurants.  OK... I'm probably nit-picking on the plates, but they were a strange choice.  The Miss:   The crepes.  We talked about the crepes for the entire meal.  They were a serious let down.  They were thick and the word that came to my mind instantly was \"chewy\".  A chewy crepe?  It was thicker and chewier than most flour tortillas.  Crispy?  No.  Delicate and light?  No and no again. For a place that has \"Crepe\" in their name, it was a huge miss.    We were trying to figure out how you get bad crepes at a place named \"Crispy Crepe\".  Our best guess:  Imagine a chef who read one book about crepes but had never tasted one... never eaten one to see the wonder that they can be.  Berries?  Check.  Nutella?  Check.  Crepe?  Hmmm... spread some batter around in a pan with a little wooden spreader... how hard can it be?  See!  Easy!  Done!  Time to open a crepe shop!  We want to like this place so much.  It's cute, has nice service and wasn't jam-packed at 9am on a Sunday morning.  Maybe we will give it another shot and stick to the waffles next time.",

The portion is pretty large- I had to take my crepe home and it was even just as good for the following day. I ordered the chicken bruschetta crepe with the scalloped potatoes. Melt in your mouth crepe, which was crusted in garlic and cheese. I started off with some French onion soup as did my husband- a great starter.

I had the chicken, goat cheese, and spinach crepe. It was nothing short of  delectable. The flavors were front and center in each bite. They are not stingy when it comes to filling the crepes, I had enough left over to take home for a small lunch. Our server was very patient with us and checked on us throughout our meal. I will be back!",

Now, in Crispy Crepe's defense, the waitress told me it was super sweet (And I LOVE sweets), but WHOA! It was so sweet and sugary I couldn't even enjoy it. Not a fan of this dish.   I decided to give this place another shot today (based on its reputation alone) and ordered the vegetarian crepe. The veggie crepe was pretty good. The mushrooms gave the crepe a great texture and was paired nicely with the sauteed spinach and cheese. The potatoes that were served as my side were one of the best parts of my meal.   I'll probably give this place another shot and try another meal in the future. I really want to like this place, but am not incredibly impressed.",

Definitely good quality products!  As others have said, the parking is a little hairy if you go at a busy time but there are normally spots in the parking deck behind the restaurant.   Though our server was extremely sweet and informative, it seemed our food took longer than expected, especially since we were 1 of 2 tables there at the time (over 25 minutes). If you're in a rush, this isn't the place for you. Definitely a place to sit back and relax. Absolutely willing to give it a go again though since the food was so delicious!  Happy eating!",

I wouldn't have randomly stopped by here and only knew of this place because some coworkers told me about it.    Crispy Crepe has a good amount of tables, and also have some couches, but I would recommend sitting at the tables so it would be easier to eat.  I thought it was great that the tables all had a touch of a real flower in a small vase.  Made it feel nice inside.  Their menu has different variety, but not too much to overwhelm you with what you should choose.  I decided to get the Mediterranean Chicken, and man o man did I make the right choice!  The food was good, and not at a bad price either.  I'm sure I could have watched them make my food as they have a big glass where you can view them making the crepes, but I wanted to score a seat at a table before it started getting too busy.  The only reason this place lost a star is because with their parking, I had to park at a meter and parallel parking is not my forte.  I plan on going back one day and getting a dessert crepe to fulfill my sweet tooth needs.",

Keep in mind the plates from our meal remained the entire time.   In terms of the crepes themselves, they were good. The egg ones were a bit under seasoned however so we had to order a side of sirracha. Also oddly the potatoes on the side were not home fried it was more of a potato salad.",

But compared to Crepe Cellar and a couple other places around town, just missed the mark.   Almost $6 for a couple small drop coffees seems a little steep as well... but maybe I'm just being picking because the food didn't hit the mark.   Come early. Avoid the line.   Service was great!   Probably will come back and try two new selections and maybe a sweet option.",

We visited the Crispy Crepe as a treat after a doctor's appointment one afternoon for a late lunch and I'm so glad we did.  Upside, parking and getting a table were a breeze.  Downside, they were out of that potato casserole everyone raves about.  Ugh!  Next time I'll go earlier.  Our savory crepes were delicious.  Our table tried the Bruschetta Crepe, which is a mediterranean favorite with feta, chicken, fresh tomatoes, oregano and garlic.  It was my favorite of the day, very fresh tasting but filling!  We also had the pecorino chicken crepe, which was described as having the flavors of a Chicken Caesar Salad.  It was just ok, and I really didn't care for the cheese toasted into the crepe.  I'll try another crepe next time.  My daughter had the Basil Grilled Chicken panini and was so impressed she hasn't stopped talking about it.  Very well flavored and hearty.  We all shared a dessert crepe between the 3 of us.  We chose the Nutella and Strawberry crepes.  So good!  The crepes are thicker than average crepes, perfect to withstand the intense sweetness of the Nutella.  The strawberries brighten the whole dish up.  We had a great visit in this open, airy dining establishment and will be back!",

    "text": "1436 South Blvd  I was recently taken out to the Crispy Crepe restaurant for brunch by my lovely daughter and it was a nice surprise to go there as it is very conveniently located in the city of Charlotte. I had heard nothing but good things about the restaurant but I was a little hesitant about going as I am not very much into crepes but I was willing to try.   We arrived and were seated immediately. They have a nice size restaurant interior with a few tables outside for those who would like to enjoy the weather. Our server Tamara was very open, friendly and patient as I asked several questions about how the food was prepared or what was included with various menu selections. My daughter ordered a Vanilla Steamer (a drink that is similar to warm milk) with the Egg and Turkey Sausage Waffle Platter. I ordered a Cookie Butter Latte with the same Egg and Waffle Platter but with the Turkey Bacon instead.   The drinks came out first and were divine. I took my time sipping because I knew that they would go fast and at $5.59 per cup I did not want to order a second one carelessly. If you have not had the Cookie Butter Latte and you normally like Latte's well by all means try this one as it is simply scrumptious.  The food arrived shortly thereafter and my meat was not right when it came out (they delivered the sausage by accident) however the waitress quickly went back and retrieved the proper meat (the bacon that I had originally ordered) and brought it out at no additional charge.   The consistency of the crepes were light and fluffy and the flavor was slightly sweet.  Surprisingly for someone who doesn't normally get excited by breakfast crepes, pancakes or waffles, this place takes the gold star.  I cannot wait to go back as the food was delicious, the ambiance was nice, Tamara's service was outstanding and the overall pricing was reasonable definitely give them a try before everyone in the city starts to go and will then overcrowd the place.  It is definitely worth it. - 5 Stars!!",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. They're only open for breakfast and brunch/lunch now.   We got there around 11 and there was a 25 minute wait for a table. It was crowded, so even when we got a table it was a small square table for 4 people that we squeezed 5 people around. I'm sure it gets cut down on wait times though.   I started with a chai latte which was pretty good. It wasn't too sweet which I appreciate. We got a Chipotle chicken crepe and a smoked salmon, egg, and herb goat cheese crepe. Both were very good, but it was my first time trying the smoked salmon and it was amazing. They put herbs in the crepe batter too which really enhances it.   We also tried a banana and butterscotch waffle which was pretty good. I actually like their sweet crepes more though. I didn't think the waffle had enough toppings.   If you've never been here before, I definitely recommend checking it out!",

They close at 4 on Sundays in case planning for a late lunch or evening meal option. Highly recommend !",

    "text": "This was my first time to Crispy Crepe and I'm not sure how I feel about my experience. My feelings are a little mixed. To start, the place is in a great location, the atmosphere is nice, and all of the food looks really good.   When my wife and I first walked in, it was very smoky inside. To the point it felt like I was in the kitchen the entire time. I even left smelling like I just worked a shift at the Waffle House. They even had to prop the doors open, but that did not help at all.  The staff was nice and very helpful. I just wasn't sure what to get as there were many options that looked appealing. I settled for the eggs, turkey bacon and waffle plate. It also came with a hash brown casserole scoop. The turkey bacon and eggs were good and so was the hash browns. The waffle on the other hand is part of why I docked a star. It was the most dense and thick waffle I have ever had. It was like eating a tough piece of bread. It was not fluffy or soft at all. It had a good flavor, but I could not stop saying to my wife how tough it was the entire time. I even had trouble cutting it with my knife at times. I'm not sure why this is the case but it's enough for me to never want a waffle there again.   To make matters worse, if I wanted some of the toppings on my waffle, I would be charged an additional $4. Which is kind of ridiculous, being that I was already being charged $12 for the plate. There was also no option for anything other than the turkey bacon. My wife had a crepe and they charged her $3 extra to add the chicken on it. For the price that we paid, I expected to be blown away and I felt very let down. The price, the food and the smoke everywhere is why I'm giving them 3 stars. Many people there seemed to enjoy their food and I might have just ordered the wrong thing.",

    "text": "OK, I've been here a handful of times and I think it's ready to give the Crispy Crepe my honest review: It's as good as everyone says it is!  Personally, I think it's one of the best crepe spots in Charlotte. It's usually busy on the weekends so make sure you get here early or you will wait. However, I've noticed they always tell me it's a longer wait than it really is. Last time the wait was \"45 minutes\", but we only waited 20.   Anyways- to the good stuff:  Chipotle Crepe (Chicken, Pico de Gallo, cheese,avocado & chipotle cream): You can't go wrong with chipotle. It's got a little kick to it, but nothing too over powering. If you're not a fan of spice, ask for a side of extra sour cream with it and definitely extra pico!   Spinach Goat Cheese Crepe (Ricotta cheese with sundried tomatoes, cheese, spinach & roasted red pepper pesto): First of all, add chicken. It's bangin! You can also add chicken to any veggie crepe for a slight up-charge. This crepe is the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> and one of my favorite savory crepes. So delicious!   Pecorino Chicken (chicken, romaine, parmesan & creamy caesar dressing): Basically it's like a chicken ceaser salad wrapped in a crepe and it's delicious! But it's also really big so come hungry!   Waffles: Pretty good- super dense and a little aggressive if you eat it yourself. You might be in a sugar or chocolate coma after it so think about splitting it with someone else first. I had the Cookie Butter one and was in heaven while eating it.  For sides, the salad is good and I love their dressing - a creamy pesto basil dressing (?). The potatoes are also a must! They are so cheesy and delicious.   For the 2 pairs out there- do yourself a favor and order one crepe and one waffle or one savory crepe and one dessert crepe. Get the best of both worlds. Plus, the servers are happy to bring you an extra plate if you share.",

It has everything on the menu from savory and sweet crepe entries as well as options for your gluten free and vegan friends.   I recently visited with just such a group where we had gluten free and vegan requirements and both parties were extremely pleased. I had the chipotle chicken crepe and it was delightful. The portions were very substantial and being a 6'1\" guy with a healthy appetite I was satisfied.   The staff is very friendly and helpful and the decor is pleasant.

The place looked fast-food and casual, but the prices were $11-12 for a crepe!  We were sat fairly quickly and went ahead and put in our order so we could eat quickly. First, the waiter screwed up our order and put the wrong thing in, and then told us 3 times that our food was almost out. It took 40 minutes for us to finally get our food after we ordered, and the manager even brought out the wrong side after they had already corrected my order once. We couldn't get the waiter's attention to get a straw so we got up and found one ourselves.   Overall, the wait and the service was horrible. After expressing my concerns with the manager, he only told me that yes, that sounded frustrating and then brought me my food. Did not even bother to partially pay for my check.  I will never return here and never tell anyone to go here again. GO TO CAFE MONTE IN SOUTH PARK. I can not say this enough. The quality of the crepes are a million times better, and even though it's about $2 more expensive, the environment, quality, and service are a million times worth it.",

    "text": "Just OK.  Had lunch here today.  My girlfriend and I were both remarking on how we liked it, until we got the bill.  It was very overpriced.  I got the signature chipotle chicken salad served on flatbread.  It tasted like a gordita from Taco Bell.  That's not to say it was bad, but if I wanted taco bell that's where I would have gone.   The chicken amount was skimpy, but what was there was very flavorful and well cooked.  I just can't get over how similar the flatbread tasted to the Taco Bell entree.  It was very strange, but I did like it.  Anywho.  For dessert I got the cookie butter waffle.  These are dough waffles, not batter waffles - and I've had them done better (see Cast Iron Skillet in South Park), but it was still yummy.  I'll probably ask them to go light on the cookie butter topping next time.  The low light of the meal was the side of au gratin potatoes.  It was not good.  My dinning companion agreed.  I should have listened to my fellow yelpers. When will I learn.  So the smallish taco bell like entree, the desert and an Ice tea was 26 plus tip.  I think that high.  They also screwed up my waffle.  I asked for no whip.  The kitchen messed it up - not the waitress.  Also a few other comments:  1. The restaurant itself is cute, but the open kitchen allows for that grease smell.  We both left smelling like old Chinese food.     2.  Management really should keep employees from congregating/eating in the dinning room.  Twice I had to walk back to the restroom and both times there were staff hanging out in the back table. Patrons have to past them to use the facilities.  I found it unprofessional..and more importantly, the table had unsightly half eaten take out and other garbage on it.  Also the bathroom could be cleaner. It wasn't terrible, but I think they get a lot of foot traffic from passers by due to it being tucked back by the back entrance. I.e. folks can slip in and out w/o anyone seeing them..  So to sum it up..my waffle was yummy and I LOVE waffles.  I'll go back for that alone..and I'll get water cause the prices are steep yo.",

    "text": "I visited this restaurant today with a friend who had been wanting to go. I had never heard of this restaurant, but I was open to trying something new. We split three meals: a cookie butter waffle, the smoked salmon crepe w/fruit, and a cheese omelet w/ potatoes. We were greeted by a male waiter. He asked us if we were ready to order even though we had just gotten there. Since we'd never been there he took our drink orders and left. He brought me a sweet tea that looked like cloudy apple juice. It tasted like it was old. And again he asked if we were ready to order even though much time hadn't passed. We told him we weren't ready to order and he tried to rush us by asking if we wanted to know his favorites. But I didn't ask for his input. I wanted to continue to look. But he offered his opinion, and we quickly decided on those 3 items. He went to put the order in and we didn't see him again till the food came. I informed him that the tea wasn't good and instead of saying \"I'm sorry about that, let me get you something else,\" he told me \"Oh yeah it did look kinda weird when I brought it.\" So we got out food. The cheese omelet was good, not hard to mess up. The potatoes reminded me of mashed potatoes though. The salmon crepe was not as creamy as I expected, which is what I expected from an entree with goat cheese. The eggs and salmon in the crepe were both over cooked. The cookie butter waffle was really good. It would have been better if my drink had been refilled because it was very sweet, but my waiter was outside socializing while I went without  he finally refilled it, but I was ready to leave and my friend was too. She waiter gave us our checks, picked them up AND asked us if we needed change. Uhhhh...YES I DO I WAS THIRSTY WHILE YOU WENT OUTSIDE AND THEN CAME BACK IN AND STOOD IN THE KITCHEN DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM MY TABLE AND LAUGHED AND TALKED. I work hard for my $ and I truly want it back. Such a damper in a beautiful day.",

So we were given a menu, and honestly I felt kind of rush to order because he kept staring me down ready to take my order any sec, it was kind of understandable though. I ordered 1 savory crepe, and 1 sweet crepe. I picked the smoked salmon & the apple streusel. The smoked salmon also came with potatoes they were pretty good! Very creamy. The salmon crepe however was soooo friggin' dry, I just got tired of eating it halfway though. The apple streusel crepe though, tasted weird to me. The apples were pretty sour, and it was so salty? Was it suppose to be that salty? I had waaay better crepes, I don't know if whether they were rushing that's why it wasn't that tasty, but I was pretty disappointed especially for the $$ I paid lol! The shop however was very cute/chic, I like how each table had its own little cute flower & the wall art was lovely. But I don't know if I would be back, maybe to try their lattes ?",

    "text": "The wife and I have now been here on several occasions and the food and service has always been great. The crepes are huge and tasty with plenty of filling whether they be sweet or savory.   Overall, we have tried the vegetarian, smoked salmon, chipotle chicken and shrimp  crepes, and they are all great. The crepes all come with sides and the daily salad has easily been the best with variations on tabbouleh and chick pea salad. My only gripe is the kettle chips as a side, which were really just regular potato chips from a bag, and not even kettle chips. Also, last time I took a shawarma lamb sandwich, which was a good change of pace, but I would be hard pressed to say that is was better than the crepes.  For the dessert we usually take a waffle and our favorite is the maple delight, but the banana butterscotch is a close second. The lattes and espresso here is also pretty good if you need a little caffeine pick me up. We shall return often.",

When our two crepes and coffee were delivered (order at the counter and they bring out to you) the plates were hanging off the table and had to be very careful not to knock coffee of the table.  Mind you there were 4 chairs around this table.  The plates were huge which was overly annoying and not well thought out.  The crepes themselves were actually quite thick, very large, and overly sweet for my taste.  One would definately have been enough for two people to share (especially as a dessert).  I wish they would have advised of this when we were ordering.  Suggestion would be to advise customers of the size or possibly offer a smaller portion option.  I also found the prices to be a little on the high side for dessert.  Our two dessert crepes and specialty coffees were about $25.  I do have to say that they add a chocolate covered strawberry to each dessert (not that you really need any more to eat) that is absolutely delicious.  I will most likely not visit again but if I do will be very mindful of the portion size and prices.",

However, due to it being Sunday there was a decent amount of people waiting for tables. We put our name on the list and waited. A couple that came in 10 minutes behind us were seated before we were and I had two people in my party. There were 6 to 8 servers and everyone at every table were having issues or problem with how slow service was, getting checks or even drinks. Once we are finally seated we ordered immediately because we saw how slow service was. It took them over 55 minutes serve us their special of the day and one of the regular menu items. My wife order to tea and it came with no spoon, she asked for more  sugar and that came 10 minutes later. I ordered a water and I couldn't get brought back until my food came out. Again due to the slow service I asked for the check when the food came out. It probably took them another 20 minutes to come pick up the check.  All that being said about this problems with the servers and the staff being slow, the food did taste very good and I would go there again but maybe just to pick up food.",

    "text": "So, I really hesitated about the appropriate number of stars for this place. I wish I could give 4.5. I mean, in the category of casual eateries, it probably deserves 5 stars, but compared to all restaurants I've been to ever in my life, 4 seems more appropriate. Moving on--the food. We hesitated to try the Crispy Crepe due to the lukewarm reviews, but I am sure glad we stopped in tonight. Our server was great and helpful (not to mention right on target) with menu selections. We had the Mediterranean, Apple Brie, and Bruschetta crepes for our meal along with fruit and the salad of the day (rice and asparagus). It was all delicious. The crepes themselves were just right, crispy edges, mmmm. I read another review that described both the Mediterranean and Apple Brie crepes as bland. They must have changed something since that review. All of the crepes were flavorful and amazing fresh from the kitchen. The Bruschetta crepe suffers a bit from sitting around (I nibbled the leftovers from the plate of one of my kids, and it was not as good as it was right at first), so it might not be a good choice for takeout. The combination of the brie and apples is tasty (not too sweet). The pesto on the Bruschetta crepe is so yummy and delicious. The Mediterranean manages to capture all those flavors you expect in that kind of crepe, the saltiness of the olives and tanginess of the vinaigrette. The spinach was clearly fresh too. All in all, they were delicious. The kiddos ate them up too. We tried an old standby for dessert, the banana and Nutella crepe. You just can't go wrong and Crispy Crepe does it right. It was very good. I'd say it was better than that other option in town for crepes and way way cheaper. For $35 we were stuffed! Will definitely return!",

    "text": "I am a bit partial to my go-to crepe place in Matthews, but had to give this place a shot since it is within easy walking distance to my new place.  Usually when I drive by, there is a crowd waiting to be seated, so naturally I had already hyped this place up for myself.  Expecting a crowd, I was pleasantly surprised there was no wait and the place was busy, but not busting at the seams (like I had grown accustomed to seeing on my drive-bys).  It probably had something to do with the frigid cold temps that morning... but it was our gain.  The menu looked super-delicious, probably cause I had just ran 9 miles in the morning so I was ready to eat!  Had their Bacon, Egg, and waffle platter and was pretty happy with what I got.  The turkey bacon was super tasty, the eggs perfectly cooked - maybe wished for some bread to soak up the yolk... instead I used part of my waffle, and the waffle was a unique doughy texture (in a good way).  Our server was on point!  Always refilling out coffee cups and checking on us to make sure we were okay.    I wasn't completely blown away, but I will definitely go back.  Something about the room being fairly smoky (from a previously burned food item- I am guess) and then the craziness... or lack-there-of in the kitchen.  Since it is open, I saw a lot of folks waiting for something to do.  I think what happened is that they were anticipating a usual Saturday crowd, but the weather keeping people in, gave the staff more presence in the restuarant than customers.",

Until they fix the ventilation, don't even consider sitting inside. Pray the weather is nice and choose the patio. Had a great meal today, but was chased out by thick smoke that burned eyes and left clothing smelling like we'd just worked the grill. With an efficient ventilation system, Crispy Crepe would be an easy 5 Stars.",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to the historic south end of Charlotte near the Dilworth neighborhood to Crispy Crepe.   Dora here. Hey, I recognize that cute guy in the red shirt! :) I would've preferred to sit outside, but the Saturday afternoon of our visit was a scorching 95 degrees. The interior was cozy and air conditioned. Check out that giant bottle of chocolate syrup along the wall. How cool is that?   This unique eatery not only serves crepes, but also waffles, salads, flatbreads and sandwiches.   I chose the Egg n Turkey Bacon Waffle which is served with two eggs, turkey bacon and fresh fruit. Now this waffle is not an ordinary waffle. It is a Liege waffle, named after a city in Belgium, and is made using brioche style dough and caramelized Belgian sugar, and pressed in a cast iron press.   This waffle was outstanding, definitely the highlight of the dish, and reminds me of waffles from our trips to Europe. The soft scrambled, not runny eggs and bacon were perfectly cooked.   Dora here. Isn't that plate huge? I couldn't let Ernie eat that whole meal by himself!  He definitely needed help with the waffle. Wow! Yeasty and yummy and my fork kept sneaking over to his plate. :)  I strategized my order. I knew we were going for a sweet crepe, so I ordered the Smoked Turkey with White Stilten Cranberry Cheese sandwich. Doesn't that sound intriguing? I know, right? And look at it. Sweet caramelized onions, cranberry cheese...need I say more? Yummo! And to be fair, I did share. :)  The Chocolate Peanut Butter crepe was filled with mini chocolate peanut butter cups, vanilla cream & drizzled with caramel. The chocolate and cream, almost like a donut cream, all mingled together for a sweet ending to a great meal. Check this out!  Dora here. The crepes don't normally come split like this. Somebody was a bit too quick with the knife. Lucky I snapped a picture because this crepe vanished within seconds.  The coffee was a different story. Too weak for me. Bummer.   Three hours of free parking is available in a garage around the corner. Service was a bit slow because of the packed restaurant, but you won't need that long to eat. :)  We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.  ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

    "text": "Came here on Friday after dinner for dessert.   -Prices: I thought the prices were pretty high. I think we paid $10 for one of the dessert crepes.  -Food: We ordered the maple crunch crepe to split. It was good, the filling was super thick though....nothing excellent. The best part about the crepe was the chocolate covered strawberry that came with it!  -Service: Nothing spectacular. Got us drinks, took our order, brought us food, and brought us the check. Just the basics.  -The problems: We arrived at 8:20pm on Friday night. The place closes at 9pm. We walked in and got a seat. There were a handful of other groups in there eating. Right after we ordered, they started stacking the chairs on top of the tables all around us. This was around 8:30! It was extremely distasteful and made us not want to be in there. We quickly ate our crepe and left. I worked in the food industry for many years and know that balance as an employee of wanting to close up, clean up, and get out of there as quick as possible. But putting the chairs on top of the tables 30 minutes before close, is probably crossing the line a bit! I really hope owners/management is reading this because if the place looks closed before it is actually closed, there goes evening sales.   Unfortunately, we most likely will not return. We really aren't high maintenance people when it comes to eating place (actually we are probably some of the easier customers to please cause we are so passive!), but when I don't feel welcome, I don't want to be there.",

The staff is always friendly and professional. The only thing that keep me from giving them five stars is that it's very smoky inside. After you've been seated for a while, it's get to the point that your eyes start burning. You can see a layer of smoke in the room. I'm not sure why they don't install better ventilation or keep either the front or back door open so the smoke can escape.

I decided to grab a crepe before I hit Atherton Market on a Saturday at 11:00, and I thought I might be the only one in there. Wrong! It was hoppin'. Thankfully, there was one parking space left in the garage.  There were a few tables with umbrellas outside, but inside was nothing like I'd pictured - there were probably 10-15 tables with a big, open kitchen so you can watch them make the crepes, which looked like works of art. The wall had a cute mural of a cafe painted on it, and it definitely had a quaint, cafe vibe. I was by myself, but I didn't feel out of place at a two-top table, and my waitress, Liz, was awesome.   I had a cup of coffee (strong and delicious at $2.89), and after much deliberation, I decided on the apple streusel crepe ($10.99). Mmmmm. It was almost too pretty to eat - almost - and it tasted as good as it looked. The apples were tart and warm, and the walnuts and streusel were crunchy; the dollop of creme fraiche cheese on top was a welcome addition. I also loved that the crepe was hearty - I've had some crepes that are so thin they fall apart when you eat them, but not this one. I especially appreciated the chocolate-dipped strawberry and whipped cream on the side... was that only a garnish? Nom nom nom.",

I think they have a variety of salads and other lunch goodies on the menu, but the waffles are something else. More like a dessert nearly than a proper breakfast, and certainly not something the cardiologist will approve of, but very very very yummy.   And sometimes that's exactly all that really matters.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place since it opened, and buying the Groupon gave me just such an opportunity to do so.  Thus, my partner and I ventured here fairly early on a Saturday morning for breakfast.  Cookie Butter Latte:  Holy cow, this drink was flippin' awesome.  It was not too sweet, tasted very smooth, and I absolutely loved the cookies that came with it.  All the flavors came together well to produce a tasty drink.  I would come back here again just for this drink.  (5/5)  Americano:  Surprisingly, this was not as good as the latte.  I suppose when you add the milk and sweetness, you really don't get a lot of the coffee flavor.  By itself, the coffee was a little plain tasting and a little bitter.  (2/5)  Maple Delight Waffle:  When this came out, my first thought was that it was so small for the price.  However, when I cut into, I realized how dense the waffle was.  I suppose that's not surprising, since it's made from dough rather than a batter.  The flavor of the waffle itself was good, and I liked the thick yet soft texture of it.  The waffle itself was fairly sweet.  When you added the maple cream, whipped cream, and syrup, it was more like eating a dessert than eating a breakfast dish.  It was good, but a little too sweet and rich.  I could not finish it.  (3/5)  Egg and Bacon Cheddar Crepe:  I don't think I have ever had crepes this thin and crispy, which was definitely different.  The crepe itself was lighter in texture and less doughy than other ones I've had, and I really enjoyed that.  However, it had very little of the bacon in it and was mostly eggs.  That was a little disappointing.  The bacon that was in it was  good, though, and overall I did enjoy it.  For the price, though, the portions were not terribly big.  (3/5)  The staff was pretty friendly and efficient.  Our food came out quickly.  It's bright and cheery in there and I love the open design.  It's nice that they have decent parking in the garage and some street parking as well, but I am guessing there is an issue later in the evening when World of Beer starts filling up.  Overall, it was good, but without the Groupon, I don't know if I felt like everything was worth it.  I'd be willing to try it again.  Goodness knows I will likely come back here next time I'm craving that cookie butter latte.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been to Crispy Crepe a handful of times now, and I do like them very much (with the exception of their specialty coffees).  We've only been here for breakfast, and I like that they open early on weekends.  They also have a barista and offer a variety of specialty coffee drinks, but I'll warn you that the syrup-flavored drinks are OVERLY sweet.  The chai latte I had one time was honestly so sickly sweet I couldn't drink more than the first sip.  The server could tell I wasn't drinking it, but never asked if anything was wrong.  Boo.  I'm much happier just getting a cappuccino or latte since that occurred.  Crispy Crepe will modify any crepe you choose with more or fewer fillings.  I like getting their egg, bacon, and cheese crepe, but placing the turkey bacon on the side (for my husband), and then adding avocado and chipotle crema.  Wow, that's an awesome combination!  And their crepes are FILLED.  My husband has been more adventurous, trying several of the sweet crepe varieties, as well as their avocado BLT.  He's liked everything he's had so far.  Their sides are very good.  We've tried their salad, as gratin potatoes, and fruit.  The salad is really delicious and my favorite, topped with their homemade creamy vinaigrette (with basil?).  Their at gratin potatoes are good, but are never served hot enough, temperature-wise.  We've sent them back a couple of times for reheating.  The fruit is best in summer.  Service is usually very fast.  And they have a lot of outdoor seating covered by umbrellas, so it's nice sitting outside in both summer and winter.  All in all, we recommend Crispy Crepe.  Just beware of the specialty coffees if you don't like your drinks very sweet.",

I go for more of the turkey, chicken and lamb dishes with pesto and avocado ingredients, and they are always great. They also have a nice coffee bar with speciality cafe drinks that I usually partake in. Would come here just for that. They have a nice patio outside on South Blvd, which is great for sunny Saturdays. If you're in for a fairly quick, flavorful lunch - I highly recommend this place. We've gotten the same waitress three times, and while she never remembers us, she has given us pretty good service each time. She will forget about us and then run over to make sure we're ok, I appreciate the hustle and effort. All in all, haven't had a bad meal here yet and continue to order new things. Definitely recommend you try this place!",

Towards the end it did start to taste a little too sweet. Maybe it's because of the White Hot Chocolate... Which might I add was REALLY GOOD!!! Not too hot, just right. Creamy, buttery flavor. Definitely better than the White Hot Chocolate from Starbucks.   Anyway, the potatoes au gratin is aaaawwwesommmme!!!!  And the turkey bacon is on point. Not like that fake stuff you buy in the store. I really would have been good with the bacon, potatoes, and hot chocolate.   My eggs weren't really cooked right, but in light of the other parts of my dish... I could ignore the eggs.   Nice spot for some brunch.  I think I'll try a crepe next time. Savory or sweet? Who knows?",

I would rather have had that with less creamy, gooey, carmel, sweetness first thing in the morning.  Serious Sugar Bomb.  The apple crepe was ok.  The crepe wasn't bad, but I didn't finish it.  The apples were small-chopped & when I tried to cut into the crepe for a bite, the apples just slid away or slid out.  I ended up just scooping out the apples/oatmeal/nuts & eating that & leaving most of the crepe untouched.  The hot chocolate & mocha were well-made & tasty.  I really wanted to like this place, they have a nice patio area, but for breakfast, it just didn't cut it.  I might have to go back & try a savory crepe, or get that waffle conglomeration for dessert one evening after dinner somewhere else.    It's 3 stars just for that waffle.  Otherwise I'd have been at 2.5.",

I'm a big fan of crepes and was delighted to see a large selection of both savory and sweet options. I settled on the Smoked Salmon crepe. It was delicious  and very large. It's served with a cheese potato hash( the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the hash needs salt, pepper and love). The portions are large so if you're into sharing you could potentially share one crepe or get a savory crepe and a sweet crepe and split it between two people if you wanted to try more things on the menu.  Prices were reasonable for brunch and the service was great. Will definitely be back next time in Charlotte!",

If you read some of my other reviews you'll find I usually will give props where due  Service - greeted at the door and handed menus before being seated; 5-10 minutes before server comes to the table (host did check and follow up) then another 5-10 for water  Food - over seasoned and kind of disappointing because the buckwheat crepe was quite tasty; my herbed goat cheese/chicken/spinach crepe was over seasoned with herbs; other half's apple and Brie with onion marmalade was mostly cinnamon apples with 5-6 small pieces of Brie he barely found and strings of cooked onion (definitely not a marmalade) - there were so many apples it should have been a dessert crepe.  Comfort - not sure if the AC wasn't working or it got too hot; the front door was open and the restaurant was a little warm as a result",

I got a house coffee (great- a little \"weak\" for my taste but you could tell the beans were freshly roasted and ground- it was a great, complex cup of coffee).   My breakfast was an apple streusel crepe which was amazing- sweet, buttery, and cinnamony. My husband got the egg/veggie/cheese crepe. I actually liked his better for a meal, because by the end of mine I was on a sugar high. Both used high quality ingredients throughout! I think in the future, my husband and I could split a sweet and a savory instead of getting separate meals.   Expensive compared to what we usually pay for breakfast ($40 after tip) but I don't mind paying extra for quality. Large portions. Neither of us could finish. We will be back!",

I had the Shrimp Crepe which was awesome. The outside was crispy though the inside that was wrapped around a ton of filling was a bit chewy as others have pointed out. I still loved my meal.  My boyfriend wanted to try the Shawarma and asked that it be made as a crepe. Just as others had found the chef had no issues accommodating this and he said it too was really good. I also had a Vanilla Cafe Latte which was so good. We sat around for a while after dinner chatting over our coffee.   I can't wait until it is warm enough to sit out on the patio.",

I am not a crepe connoisseur, but the crepes were very doughy and heavy, rather than thin.  Also, there was not much flavor to the breakfast crepe I had.  After trying the crepe, I tried their Liege waffle.  Unfortunately, that too was very doughy and left me not feeling that well.  (I did enjoy the bonus chocolate covered strawberry, though)  The #1 downside of this place are their high PRICES.  I would not mind the food being mediocre, but the prices are very high for the quality you get.  I think I am done with this place for now until someone persuades me to return.  For now, if I want crepes, I will keep going back to Hazelnuts Creperie.",

I had the apple streusel crepe and it was very delish, my friend had the cinnamon roll crepe and it was VERY sweet; almost like  cinnamon toast crunch cereal.  I do recommend this place for something fun and quaint and its very enjoyable.",

    "text": "This place is ok, but I don't know that I will be rushing back.  I had the egg and veggie cheddar crepe.  I really liked it but i agree with the other reviews that they are more rubbery crepes than crispy.  My wife had the waffle, egg, and turkey bacon platter.  The waffle was extremely dense.  We couldn't tell if it was under cooked or if that was how it was intended.  The flavor reminded me of a soft pretzel dough...kind of.  All in all..not bad...not great...but with so many unique items on the menu we will probably give it another try one of these days.",

One time we were seated outside, ordered our food, and waited more than 50 minutes before it came out. The second time, we ordered an Egg, Bacon, Cheese omelet for brunch to go, and when we got it home it was a vegetable omelet - not even close! If you can't get my order right, and when you do, it takes almost an hour, I will definitely take my business elsewhere.",

I ordered the Chocolate Nutella and Banana Crepe. It was phenomenal.  Needless to say, can't go wrong with Nutella! Lol. The food was definitely satisfying.  My counterpart ordered the Hot Caramel Apple. The mug was almost overflowing with whipped cream, but was delicious! I will definitely return to try other crepes!",

After getting a seat we got in line and it took roughly ten minutes to order it seemed they did not have a grasp on how to run things smoothly. I was not told I had to get my own coffee so I waited until everything was brought out and then was told. Our food was not that great my gf got a Nutella banana and said it was over cooked and lacking In banana . I got a bacon cheddar egg and it had tons of cheese lousy turkey bacon and hardly any egg. So the food was not so good and the service and all around design was not great. I know they are new so we might give it another try in 6 months.",

I ordered the grilled marinated shrimp-just ok.  My husband ordered the lamb sandwich, next remove the fat and use more meat and the flatbread was stale.  This was not worth the one hour and twenty minutes.  We will never come back again and would not recommend the to anyone.   You are over rated.  Yuck!  PS the free Thursday crepe dessert (apple streusel) was never served to us as ordered.",

We were getting hungry and there were several restaurants to choose from.  This one just seemed to be right down our alley.  The funny thing is we didn't get a crepe; I got a salad and my daughter got the grilled cheese and portabella sandwich.  Both were delicious.  The dressing wasn't heavy-handed on the salad and the grilled shrimp were spiced just right.  The servers were attentive and it was small enough where we didn't have to scream at each other to have a decent conversation over the din of a lot of people.  Can't wait to have another reason to head back!",

The quality of the smoked salmon is very poor and tasted like salmon jerky, additionally the goat cheese in the description was completely missing.  Additionally, I am a little bit of a coffee snob an the coffee they serve reminded me of bad hotel coffee.",

    "text": "It's Sunday Brunch season and Crispy Crepe was our restaurant of choice. I ordered the Eggs and Turkey waffle platter with potatoes. The potatoes were the best thing on the plate. The waffle was dry, hard, and flavorless. The fact that you have to pay $2.99 for syrup is ridiculous so I had three bites and left the rest on my plate. I will say again the potatoes were wonderful! The service was subpar. Our waitress got all of our orders mixed up when the plates came so my eggs were on my cousins plate, her waffle was on a friend's plate, someone's turkey bacon was on her plate and someone else got a plate with absolutely nothing they ordered. So it took about three trips for everything to get fixed. The waitress was rude and stated \" Well, usually when people order their food they know what they ordered and can tell us before the servers give them the plate\". She brought the tickets at the end of the meal and had additional charges on my ticket for something that I didn't have. I am allergic to citrus so I am not able to drink orange juice. The fact that she added a charge of $2.99 for Orange Juice that would send me to the hospital if I drink it was outrageous. At no point did I have anything to drink other than water. Needless to say she did not get a tip because of her lacking service,  smart remarks, @and erroneous charges. I will certainly not be going back there for brunch. As a foodie,  this experience left me very disappointed on multiple levels.",

    "text": "Sweet treats abound at Crispy Crepe. In addition to the crepes, they have liege waffles and creative coffee drinks. For those who arent aware, a liege waffle is different and much better than a normal waffle. These belgian style waffles are filled with pearl sugar that caramelizes when cooked. Theyre more like desserts than breakfast dishes. My favorite crepe is the fresh fruit medley which is filled with strawberries, bananas, and honeydews then topped with a dulce de leche sauce. The menu description says that is also includes kiwis but I have never seen a kiwi in this crepe and Ive ordered it several times-I wish theyd actually start putting them in. One of my only complaints about Crispy Crepe is that their menu descriptions are also inaccurate. The bananofie crepe is good but I was a little peeved about the misleading menu description. This crepe is supposed to be filled with bananas and a butterscotch custard. I love custards so I was a bit dismayed when my crepe arrived and was topped with a butterscotch sauce instead of a custard-not the same thing! It was still very tasty but I think it would be even better with a real custard. Ive never had a chance to order the coffee drinks because its hard for me to drink a sugary drink while also eating a sweet dish but one day, Ill have to come in to get coffee and nothing else. The butter cookie latte sounds intriguing. Overall, very good but beware of the fact that what you order may not match the description exactly!",

My daughter ordered the Roastbeef panini and loved it.  I had the shrimp crepe and my husband had the chicken chipole crepe.  We all LOVED our entrees!  For dessert  my daughter ordered the oreo crepe.  She loved it, but for me it was sugar overload.  my husband and I shared the Cookie butter waffle.  There are not words!!!!  Carmelized crispy sugar, bananas whipped creme!!!  We are already planning our next trip.  I read the comment about no coffee refills, that must have changed, we were offered free coffee refills, and had fast and very courtiest  service.  Love, love love this restaurant!!!!",
