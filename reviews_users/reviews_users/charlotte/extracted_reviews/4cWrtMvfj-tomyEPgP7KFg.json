I liked the cheese ok, but I got tired of it pretty quick.  How many items do you want to try covered in melted cheese?  The salad was good.  But the main dish was a big disappointment.  I got the meat selection.  You basically end up with boiled steak and chicken.  It wasn't good at all.  The dipping sauces were good, but if you're dipping boiled steak in it, it doesn't matter that much.  And the potatoes weren't good - you ended up with a chunk of boiled potato.  Who wants to eat that?   Dessert was good.  I just dipped the strawberries and bananas, and they were great.  But I am not a big sweets person and didn't want all that sweet stuff.  For the price, I won't go back.",

I love their house salad, their house dressing is amazing.  My favorite is the court bouillon broth, with the Pacific Rim Selection, and of course add cold water lobster tails. Their service is impeccable. And their database is amazing, they know everytime which table and server that we like to have. And their dessert ... goodness just so delicious. We typically go with the Amaretto Meltdown. We love it so much, that we even got the melting pot cookbook, But it's just not as good as dining there. I would say that this is the Ritz Carlton of restaurant in regards to service and the quality of the food",

Pulling in they have complimentary Valet, but in my opinion it's pretty unnecessary. The parking lot is literally a few steps away from the door and there were plenty of nearby spots available, so we parked ourselves. We were seated pretty quickly at a table with 2 pots. Our waitress was very nice and funny. She picked up on our sarcastic personalities right away and joined right in which just added to our experience. This wasn't our first time at Melting Pot so we were all pretty familiar with the ordering. I LOVE their Caesar Salads. Those Pine Nuts & their dressing make you want to eat only the salad and leave. We also ordered Cheese and Dessert with our Entrees. Since we had two pots we were able to choose 2 different selections for each pot. I brought a birthday cake and our waitress brought out containers and a knife so we could cut and share the cake. They even brought our a chocolate covered strawberry for my friend and I for our birthdays as well as a card signed by everyone. I would definiately return to this location.",

She took great care of us, and even after getting a big party, she made sure that the managers came to check on us regularly.   Spinach and artichoke cheese fondue was delicious, probably the best one I've had. Since the entree was endless, we were able to have all of the types of meat (filet mignon, teriyaki sirloin, herb crusted chicken, shrimp, and BBQ rubbed pork tenderloin). All of them were delicious and trying them with all the different sauces was great.   We ended up ordering a \"snickers\" chocolate that wasn't even on the menu because the manager recommended it and it didn't disappoint! We also ended up getting the \"turtle\" chocolate, which we have had before and it was great, as always.   This location definitely deserves 5 stars! They went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of and that all of our food was as great as it could have possibly been!",

And the service last time I came was horrible!!!! I spent well over $200 to be forced to share 1 pot to cook our food in with 4 people, (if you have ever eaten here before you can understand why this is a problem) then we were rushed out because the waitress said she needed to go home but wasn't allowed too leave until she was finished serving us.

The service is always amazing. Waiters are attentive with great recommendations and knowledge of the menu.   We always have the hardest time picking the cheese fondue because you cannot go wrong. The pumpernickel bread they serve it with is my personal favorite dipper.   For the entree we usually do the traditional bouillon cooking style and I like the pacific rim option that offers mainly seafood and a poultry.   By the time you get to the chocolate you will be stuffed but it is so good trust me you will power through! We have a hard time getting away from the flaming turtle which is sinful but just like with cheese the chocolate is hard to mess up!   It is pricey but worth it for the food and experience for a special night!   ** warning not a good first date restaurant because you will be there for at least 2 hours and don't want to get stuck with awkward conversation ;)",

Service is always impeccable, and the food is always perfection.  For us die-hard southern girls (and guys), be aware that they do NOT serve sweet iced-tea.  Either ask for the little packets, or peruse their extensive wine list.  They are also doing craft beers now, and even have entire menus crafted around both beer and wine.  Such a nice treat!  For dessert, it just doesn't get any better.  The luscious melted chocolate creations are all good.  And if you run out of your favorite dipper, just let them know, they'll gladly bring more!",

We love the Kings Drive location because the seating is so romantic and private.  It makes it great for date nights!    Usually, we opt for the 4-Course Experience. We always start out with the Cheddar Cheese.  My gosh!   Wow!  It is just so good.  We like a tad of extra garlic in ours and the server will always oblige.  Sometimes, my husband gets mad when the pot gets empty!   Next, my husband always gets the House Salad.  They are always so fresh and crisp. When I don't get a salad I will ask for a fruit plate which they substitute at no additional charge.   For our cooking style we always go with the Court Bouillon.  We have tried so many of the entrees here but our favorite is the Land & Sea.   Now, I will have to admit that we switch the chicken out with extra Steak on my plate and extra Shrimp on his. We just like those two the best! You can create your entree any way you like.   The BEST part is the ending....the CHOCOLATE dessert.  The Ying and Yang is what we like.  We once again substitute Milk Chocolate for the Dark Chocolate.  Oh its so good.  The pound cake, strawberries, bananas.  Wow!!  I do wish they would bring back the plain cheesecake though.   We miss it.   The service here is always good.  There are a few that's our favorites because they talk and joke wth us but everyone is very professional and nice.  The manager here is AWESOME.  He always stops by and greets us and checks on things because he sees our name on the reservations.  As you see with my review you can make this experience custom to the way you would like it and you will get every bit of your money's worth.  I highly recommend.",

We pre-ordered, so they had everything already lined up when we arrived. We had a large table with 3 separate burners. The first course was Cheese, which came with some bread and fruit I think. That was so amazing. Either I was very hungry or this was some of the best appetizer I've had. Either way, I was very satisfied. Then came the main course, steak, shrimp, chicken, put a skewer on it, put in the boiling oil pot for a few minutes and waalaa! a Great taking bit of protein. Lastly, we had 2 different kinds of melted chocolate for desert. Take your cake, your fruit, dip in the Chocolate, and wonder why you don't do this every weekend. This was a good experience and a worthwhile place to make a memorable event.",

    "text": "The Melting Pot is really disappointing. You pay high prices for the \"experience\" rather than the quality of the food. We got the four-course experience.   Our first course was cheese. It came with standard pieces of bread and vegetables to dip into the cheese. It was good, but it was just cheese and store bought dippings. It wasn't anything you couldn't make at home.   The second course was two caesar salads. They were just your average caesar salad with lettuce croutons cheese and dressings.  The main course we got a mixture of steaks, lobster, shrimp, pork and chicken. The boiling of the meat in the broth did not give the meats/seafood much flavor. It was eh-- not too appetizing.  The best part was the chocolate dessert course. The cheesecake, poundcake, brownies and strawberries were so delicious dipped in chocolate. We got the turtle and it tasted amazing!  Service was good. I would come back for dessert only. The rest of the courses were not worth the high price tag for the quality and taste of what you get.",

    "text": "Realize going in that Melting Pot is way overpriced because of the food prep. This is supposed to be quality, not quantity. Best way to enjoy Melting Pot is for romantic dessert after a small affordable meal somewhere else. Or with a group for a very special occasion and you know going in that you're dropping $75 per person if you include some alcohol. And you have a lot of time on your hands with said group that you really enjoy, like 4 hours. Which we did the other night, the company was great and we had a good time.   That said, also make sure you have a reservation and don't wait 30 minutes if they don't hit their time like we did. And also make sure you go to the restroom before you leave the house just in case their restrooms back up the the toilets overflow, like what happened to us. And make sure you pace yourself on the cheese portions because if you don't you will make yourself sick and the rest of the meal will be drudgery, especially if you get alcohol at the bar before you've had anything to eat because you had to wait so long for your table.   Other than that - and did I mention it's overpriced? - it was all good. Our server was a great sport with a large group of 16. Felt bad when the pepper grinder broke in his hands and the shards ruined a pot of cheese. But that wasn't his fault. Other than that - we had a good time. Yeah.",

My caesar had pine nuts on it. Loved the added crunch. Next course was entrees with assorted proteins... Chicken, beef, salmon, tuna, & shrimp. My favorite was the tuna but everything was delicious. Mine and everybody's favorite course is dessert. We got the snickers chocolate dip. Why this isn't on the menu is beyond me. Its great with bananas.   Good food + good service = good times!

Cheese: (1) prosciutto & asparagus and (2) zesty cheddar.  Both really good.  All the dippers were excellent.  Salads: good but pale in comparison to other courses.  They did offer a fruit plate instead which my wife selected,  and also offered to make salads to go if wanted to leave room for other courses.   Entree: filet, chicken,  shrimp, ahi tuna,  and pork tenderloin.  All great.  Veggies great.  But my favorite party of entire meal is the sauces.  Green goddess is the best!  Love then all though.   Dessert: (1) Smores with addition of PB and (2) almond joy one with half milk/half dark, sweetened coconut & almonds. Again,  dippers were awesome.    Service was good as usual.    Valet was easy,  friendly & efficient.  Took 2 hours and 50 minutes from seating until exit. One couple had never been so we had server walk them through everything.",

Pleasantly surprised with the amount of food that was provided, wonderful service, and great cocktails. I can't wait to go back but will definitely only eat a small meal before I go.  My group started with the cheddar fondue and upgraded our meal with the artisan meats. Excellent choice as the meat and cheese combination was perfect.   For our individual entrees, we chose the Coq Au Vin and I would highly recommend this cooking style as it goes well with any meat, poultry, or seafood. The herb crusted pork was especially delicious. Although there are so many other cooking styles to chose from, I don't think I could stray from my original choice as it was too delicious.",

    "text": "We waited to come back to the Melting Pot after our last experience during restaurant week. This time we came with a different couple for Double Date Nights, which happen each Wednesday in March. You get the cheese, salad, and entree courses for $50/couple, which is a great deal. They were also having a special for $7 select martinis.   We were celebrating a birthday, and after last time made sure to request 2 burners. I think for us, the table was a little crammed. Not seating wise, but once you have 2 burners and then 4 plates, 2 plates of food to cook, and 8 sauces floating around the table, you are unsure where to put your 4 waters,and 4 drinks.   The waitress was great. I think she might have been busy, or we were in an awkward part of the restaurant because it could be a little difficult to find her. She explained all of the courses, and cooking times and sauces.   I got the pineapple upside down martini, and the birthday girl got the pomegranate martini, both were on the $7 menu. Both were also pretty bad... the flavor was there, but I'm not sure the alcohol was. Mine was literally half grenadine. I would just go with a beer or glass of wine.   My husband and I ordered our regular, cheddar cheese and it was delicious. They've added grapes which was something new. For the salads, I got my normal fruit salad, which had apples, strawberries, pineapple, and blackberries. My husband got the California salad, which we said was very good. For the entree we picked the (free) beef broth cooking style, and we had shrimp, mushroom sachetti, sirloin, filet, and chicken. We also had the usual mix of mushrooms, potatoes, and broccoli. It was delicious! I love the sauces, they make my night.   Since we stuffed ourselves with green goddess and mushrooms, among the other entree foods, we decided to skip dessert. It was $30 for the 4 of us, but we just weren't into it. The birthday girl did want to partake, so her and her husband got the turtle. I think it ended up being a couple of dollars more for them to just get it, but I didn't have any room.   So overall, minus the drinks, and the occasional wait time to see the waitress this was fantastic. Definitely moved the Melting Pot back up onto our list of favorites!",

For the second course we had the house salad with the sweet&tangy vinaigrette dressing. For the main course I got the Pacific Rim, and my boyfriend got the French Quarter (he loves spicy and Cajun seasoning, so this was perfect for him). We didn't realize until later that because he got Cajun seasoned meat, everything we cooked, including the vegetables, ended up tasting too spicy for me. My meats were still delicious, though I didn't care much for the honey duck (it was my 1st time trying it). For the final course we decided on the Classic (milk chocolate with chunky peanut butter), and it did not disappoint! We left the Melting Pot feeling so full. I don't think either of us has ever felt that full in our lives! Haha If you have the opportunity to it might be nice to have a ride to pick you up after your experience meal. We were joking that we wish we would have taken an Uber because we felt so food drunk after all of that food. It didn't seem like much at the time, but it was very filling and well worth the price for a special occasion date night. Lastly, our server Ryan was excellent and talked us through how everything works since it was our first time there!",

Me and hubby love to \"taste\" meaning we love a little bite of this a little bite of that, we want a taste/a bite of everything. We just love many different flavors/foods in one meal. And here, that's all it is. So many sauces, fondues, things to dip. It's not only delicious, but it's super fun and entertaining. We brought a couple last night with us who had never been and they loved it. If you have never been to melting Pot you seriously have to go. It's so unique and fantastic. The atmosphere is really nice and cozy too. Dim lighting, which is what I want for date night. A lot of booths are super secluded and it feels like you've got the whole place to yourself. We always have great service here but last night I just LOVED our server, Josh. He was so friendly and fun and I love when servers joke back. He made our evening that much better. He was super attentive and didn't miss a beat even when I asked for refills after refills of sauces and fruit. If you go, ask for Josh! And do it! GO! But wear something loose around the stomach haha. No really, it hurts.  Note to first timers- Be prepared to be there a while. We had 4 people and were there for 3.5 hours. When I am just with hubby it's more like 2.5. Not because they're slow, they are actually very fast, but because you cook your meat and there's just so much food and 4 courses(if you choose 4 courses which is def the way to go). It's slower eating but you will be stuffed. It's dinner and an event really but it's so much fun.",

It is indeed a delicious and happy place.  The quality of the food is very good, my only concern was that the strawberries were not fresh.  There is something on the menu for everyone.

We took my 10 year old daughter and a friend of ours with...When we arrived, the staff had signed a birthday card for me, and I was given a box of 6 chocolate (white and dark) covered strawberries. That may be standard here, but when I went to another Melting Pot in New Mexico, it wasn't...so that was really nice. They sat us in a back room, at a 4-person, 2-pot table which was perfect for us! We wanted to try EVERYTHING! We had the Boston Beer Cheese Fondue and the Wisconsin Trio - The Boston Cheddar was not my personal favorite, I tend to go for the Wisconsin or Swiss fondues...but the Boston complimented the apples very well. Then we went with the Seafood and Chicken platter (no red meat for our friend) and the 2nd we chose was the land and sea...plenty of red meat there. Our cooking styles were Coq Au Vin and Mojo...I find the Mojo a little lacking in flavor and always have...but that's just my personal taste. The Coq Au Vin was very robust and added a great depth of flavor. Then on to the Creme Brulee white chocolate and a Turtle Dark Chocolate. Both were wonderful! They even gave us an extra dessert plate full of everything!   The Melting Pot is a 3-hour experience when you do The Big Night Out and add a glass of wine or two...however the experience is well worth it. The service at the Kings Drive one is exceptional! They truly will take care of you and yours!  I love spending the time on a date with my boyfriend; it gives us so much time to eat, enjoy, love, and have fun with each other.  I highly recommend this place...and as for pricing, The Big Night Out is $75-$100 per couple...but that includes cheese fondue, salad, entree, and dessert.",

    "text": "I dare you to try and leave this place hungry!!  Have been many times to Melting Pot's here and out of state and its consistently great.  Last night we went for Ladies Night Out, they offer all 4 courses for $35 and $5 of that goes to Susan G. Komen Foundation.  They do this a few times throughout the year and other times they benefit St. Jude's Children's Hospital.  A chance to eat well and contribute to a good cause?  Sign me up!!  There was 3 of us and in the past they would put us at a table w/2 burners, but not this time.  In the end we really didn't need different cheese/chocolates anyway.    We started with the cheese they are offering on the Big Night Out, it was some sort of french mixture with brie, gruyere, swiss, bacon, truffles, chives and wine.  It was delish!!  Followed that up w/house salads, I love their house dressing.  Then we had our entree.  If I go on a non-charity type night I never order the entree, I don't think its that good and I would prefer tp fill up on the other stuff, but it was included so we ate it.  It included, 3 shrimp, 3 pieces of chick, 3 pieces of steak, 2 ravioli and a bowl of potatos, mushrooms and broccoli to throw in the pot, and 6 different sauces to try.    Last but definitely not least was the chocolate.  We went with the cookies & cream, it was dark chocolate with toasted marshmallow and oreo cookie pieces.  Sounds awful right?  It comes with strawberries, bananas, cheesecake, brownies, pound cake, rice krispy treats, and different coated marshmallows.  My oldest sister and I were soo full at this point but we couldn't make ourselves stop dipping all the yummy treats into that warm chocolate, our younger sister kept making fun of our gluttonous ways, but I didn't care.   Melting Pot is not the type of place you go weekly or monthly because I really feel like you need to be in the mood for the whole experience and for the almost painfully full feeling you will most definitely have when you leave.  But its great for special occasions or to help out a good cause.",

The cheeses, meat course and salad are good but lets be honest that dessert is where its at. Id get all 3 courses as dessert if i could.   A big pot of chocolate and then cheesecake, rise crispies, bananas, strawberries, red velvet cake and marshmallows all to dip into it. Heavenly is an understatement.  I also dig that your in control of your own cooking times. So what if i cook my steak for 10 seconds...rare is good yo... Going with a large group is smart. Then you can really sample a lot of the stuff on the menu. Our party had 8 peeps in it so we got 3 different cheeses, cooking styles and  chocolates. Service was aiiiiiight considering it was a large party, but it coulda been better. I normally wouldn't be able to afford more than one course here but at $30 for everything during restaurant week it's a hella great deal.",

They also offer great suggestions to first time customers. This was definitely a great first time experience especially for people who have never tried fondue style cooking. I thought that cooking appetizers, main course and dessert on a fondue was a very unique idea. The setting and lighting has a very romantic feel. On the other side, the prices are completely ridiculously high. You do not get a lot of food for the price. Our check was over $120 and that's a ridiculous price to pay for tiny portions of food. I would suggest this to someone who wants a romantic night in town with some experimental fondue styles but I definitely wouldn't go back for that price. For $20 we bought our own fondue pot and tried our own cheese dips, meats and desserts without the crazy expensive price.",

The lights are dim, the music is soft and eclectic, and it's great for a date or couple's night. Plan on spending about $115 (without tip) per couple for a four-course meal with a 1/2 bottle of wine.  We had the Wisconsin blend cheese fondue - I thought it a bit sour and would try the spicy or cheddar blend next time. I had the California salad which was fabulous. We had a fancy broth fondue for our main course (though next time I think the regular broth one would've been fine) and the flaming turtle for dessert. All were absolutely excellent. Our service was also amazing.  I would not waste time on the veggies during the main course - stick to the protein and save room for the chocolate!",

Even though our party of 6 made a last minute reservation with a time restriction, they managed to get us in and out within an hour and a half without feeling too rushed (that's crazy fast for 4 courses). We has both the Fiesta and Swiss cheese fondue, and both were great. I especially liked the Swiss. My Cesar salad was excellent! I've never had pine nuts on a Cesar, but  the crunch gave it great texture! For the entree I had the Land and Sea, which came with filet, herb crusted chicken, and shrimp. It was way too much food for just me- I ended up sharing and still felt full. I couldn't do without dessert though, and our group went with the white chocolate creme brulee and flaming turtle. Both were delicious with the dippers! My favorite dippers were the banana slices, red velvet bites, and marshmallows.  I'll definitely be back for another special occasion!",

First day I was informed their was no tables after having made a reservations and would have to wait at bar until something became available I waited at least an hour before my table was ready to have to eventually order at bar which only serves salad and cheese. Than the second day I brought my staff and experienced a rude person again making reservations when I arrived hey say is a table of 4 which I asked for five and thank goodness one person was not able to make it. Now today I placed a reservation over the phone and took a 11:00pm time and was told that was all they had after calling all day to a busy signal and their online reservations was not available for the past 48 hours. I placed for four people called back within five minutes asked to move to 6 and again person was rude said no and than said let me check. Wow you should check first before just stating we don't have anything. Very disappointed in their customer service. Sad because melting pot is amazing but not this location apparently.

    "text": "We always hit The Melting Pot during Restuarant Week, because for $30 a person it truly is a smashing deal for a three-hour foodie experience.  Make sure you CALL the restaurant to make a reservation if you have more than 4 in your party because often times a party of 6 or more will allow you to get 2 burners at the table.  The menu during RW allows you to try the cheese fondue course (we really like the Spinach Artichoke dip one and the cheddar is really good too!), the salad (I LOVE the California--- delicious and fresh!), the main course (be sure you pay the $5 upgrade to try the mojo cooking style) which includes fresh seafood and beef cuts.... Along with this ravioli concoction that is truly incredible.  The main course comes with an array of sauces..... Green Goddess is my favorite, although our server suggested to try his favorite which is a blue cheese sauce and I LOVED it, especially with the pasta! The service is always divine and they talk you through your entire experience.  It ends with the piece de resistance..... The chocolate.  We opted for the Flaming Turtle and the Yin and Yang..... Amazing!!!!! I say if you've never \"fondued\" before.... Definitely Do! :)",

The sauces are good but it would be nice to have a list in the menu: maybe it's there and I missed it in the low light. The spinach artichoke cheese was ok but I wish we'd stopped him before the second spoonful of garlic went in. Recommend the Absolut Stress cocktail over the Strawberry Blonde.

    "text": "This is my favorite restaurant for special occasions because fondue is, well, fun! But it is a bit pricier than we usually budget for dinner out: our bill usually runs about $90-$120 for two with drinks. We have been to this location as well as the Montgomery, Ohio (Cincinnati suburbs) location several times. The service is always exceptional and it seems staff truly enjoys working at The Melting Pot. The ambience is low-key, but slightly upscale. Most of the booths are laid out for privacy.  Our standard choice is the Fondue For Two, a three-course fondue plus salad dinner that is more than enough, and a bottle of wine or two. The waitstaff will be happy to recommend a bottle from their extensive collection of wine. All fondue courses are prepared at the table on the built-in hotplate.  With fondue there comes several choices. First, the cheese course gives the option of Cheddar, traditional Swiss, Wisconsin butterkase/buttermilk blue cheese or a spicy Mexican-style cheese fondue served with bite-size bread cubes, raw vegetables and apples. We have always enjoyed the traditional Swiss cheese fondue, but I think I'd also like to try the Wisconsin.  Then, comes the salad, which you shouldn't fill up too much on even though their California greens with gorgonzola and rasperry walnut vinaigrette is delicious. Tip: you can buy the salad dressing in bottles to duplicate the salad at home.  For the main course, you will choose from several fondue styles and meats. Standard fondue choices will be oil or bouillon (vegetable broth), but for an additional fee, you can choose Coq au Vin fondue (herbs, mushroom, garlic and burgundy wine) or Caribbean bouillon with garlic and citrus flavor. The standard bouillon is low-sodium, cholesterol-free, light and healthy that does not add bulk to the meal (that pays off at the end). The meat selections include their standard chicken breast, pork tenderloin, shrimp, teriyaki sirloin and fresh fish fillet (based on availability); the market-price \"surf and turf\" with lobster tail, Filet Mignon  and portobello mushrooms; or the pricier pacific rim with teriyaki sirloin, breast of duck, pork tenderloin, chicken breast, and potstickers. All of the above come with bite-sized portions of red potatoes, mushrooms, broccoli, squash, and a variety of dipping sauces. The meats and vegetables come to the table raw and you will cook them yourself in the broth/oil, then dip and eat. See? Fun!  Hope you saved room for dessert because this is where fondue becomes sensuous. Again, you have choices to make. Chocolate comes in dark, milk, and white which you can choose unadulterated or with additives, like Bailey's Irish Cream, or Amaretto, or marshmallows and crushed Oreo cookies, or caramel and pecans. They have pre-selected combinations or create your own. I love dark chocolate + Bailey's Irish creme instead of their milk chocolate + Bailey's. \"Yin-Yang\" is pretty: dark chocolate swirled with white chocolate. Dessert fondue is served with fresh strawberries, cheesecake, pound cake, marshmallows, bananas, brownies and pineapple for dipping. This is also a good time to switch to coffee to start coming down from the wine-buzz and endorphins before attempting to drive home.  I have never walked out of this place unhappy, although I have walked out completely stuffed and pleasantly buzzed. We will keep coming back every year to celebrate our anniversary, and leave the Valentine's Day crowds for the more adventurous. Related, I have one request of TMP diners: please, introduce your kids to fondue at home. This is most definitely NOT the place for less-than-well behaved young children.",

Of course I wanted the 4 course option...seriously why would I leave without the whole experience?!   Here goes:  Alpine Cheese- they had me at gruyere...add to that fontina and a dash of nutmeg and I was in heaven. I could have licked the bowl. (But I'm a lady...so I just used the bread to get every last drop....don't judge me) It was too tasty to even get a picture of! Seriously, it's white cheesy goodness....  Strawberry Spinach Salad- very light and refreshing. I like the dressing and clue cheese crumbles as a compliment to the spinach. Well done!   Mojo- a bit of spicy a bit of Caribbean flavors in one pot. It's a total party in your mouth. Not to mention....it smells delicious!   French Quarter- filet mignon, chicken, shrimp AND andouille sausage coated in a spicy Cajun seasoning mix. Seriously. Shut up. I loved everything about this option because it offered me a little bit of everything. My favorite was the steak! It was so tender and juicy. Perfect.   Snickers- I have no clue what it's really called because it's not on the menu anymore. But it's chocolate and crunchy peanut butter and it's amaze balls.....like you could ever go wrong with chocolate.   I have no clue how we managed to eat all that food....but I'd absolutely go back to this place with no hesitation. With great service and food and an awesome overall dining experience....I'm totally a fan!!!",

    "text": "The Melting Pot is an experience.  I have been to this location several times over the years, but most recently during Restaurant Week. We had reservations for 6 people at 7:00pm. Two of us arrived early and decided to enjoy a cocktail at the bar while we waited for the others.  I decided to order one of their specialty cocktails, the strawberry blonde martini, so good.  I noticed too that you could enjoy fondue at the bar.  A nice bonus if you just want to come and enjoy a cocktail, glass of wine, and some fondue rather than an entire meal.  Once our whole party arrived we were seated and walked through how the evening will work, courses, fondue options, etc. and our drink order was taken.  (BTW, 1/2 price glasses of wine on Thursday night).  Tricia our server was so sweet and gave us ample time to look over the menu. With six of us we were able to choose two fondue options for each course. For the cheese course we ordered the Wisconsin Cheddar and the Spinach & Artichoke.  The Spinach & Artichoke was by far the favorite among all of us.  The cheese course came with apples, tortilla chips, bread, and some veggies. Loved! The salad course was next and it seemed we all ordered different ones, I chose the house salad and loved it! So fresh and just the right portion. For the main course we chose the court bouillon and coq au vin cooking styles. I ordered the signature dish, which came with tuna, chicken, pork and steak. The perfect option to allow you to taste everything.  Note: They do have veggies platter and can do anything vegan, if necessary. The main course was fun, cooking, mixing with the variety of dipping sauces and coming up with the best flavor combinations. We received broccoli, mushrooms and potatoes along with the course. On the dessert, OMG! We decided to go traditional for one, Milk Chocolate, and fun for the other, Smores.  The dessert course came with the most options for dipping, strawberries, bananas, marshmallows, chocolate chip brownies, pound cake and a few other things. Heaven!!! And, I am not even a chocolate lover, but it was just right! I am already thinking about when I can go back!  Tricia was great and I think we all enjoyed the food and experience very much!",

    "text": "I finally popped my Melting Pot cherry this week. A good friend was out of town for all my birthday celebrations and brought me here as a make up date. (After this experience... I'm okay with Rich missing my birthday every year if it means he will take me here)  First off.... the hostess gave me a birthday card when she took us to our table. It was signed by a bunch of the waitstaff. Plus, at the end of the night our server gave me a box of chocolate covered strawberries to take home. Happy birthday to me. Wow, that is some fantastic service all the way around.  What do you need to know before a night at the Pot? It is a process. So allow yourself two-three hours for dinner. Come hungry. Really hungry. Maybe the hungriest you've ever been in your life. We went with the four course experience  Cheese: The special. Bourbon Bacon Cheddar. Holy.  Salad: California. Gorgonzola cheese and raspberry vinaigrette make everything better.  Entree: We went with Coq Au Vin... delicious. I want to try the Mojo next time. I did land and sea, but was mad that I didn't go with the classic. Luckily, Rich shared some of his with me. I love all the sauces they give you. I'm a sauce whore.  Dessert: I'm about to explode. I don't really think you can go wrong with any of the choices.. they all sound amazing. I picked flaming turtle... basically so we could also get a table-side fire show.  Drinks: there were martini specials. The strawberry blonde was very refreshing. The salted caramel was absolutely delicious. I also got a boozy cappuccino to go with my dessert. It came complete with a rock sugar candy stick to use as a stirry thing.  I could barely drive home because I was so full. I thought about sleeping in my car. It was all delicious. I think it would be great to go here and just skip out on the entree portion of the evening all together and just do cheese and dessert. That may be my plan next time.  Thank you Melting Pot for a tremendous dinner... birthday celebration round 5.",

So wife gave a disgusted, you-are-hopeless, you-idiot kind of look and thankfully there were few seats available at the bar and we grabbed 'em. We were craving for the fondue all of a sudden (probably saw something on tv that day) and that is all we ordered.  Wisconsin Cheddar and for dessert Bourbon Pecan.  Both were just tres delicioso...  the way the prep the stove and make the fondue in front of you creates all the hype and anticipation and you would just wait to dip one of the various varieties of veggies/bread into the fondue and put in your mouth. Can't wait to go back!! not without a reserved table though ;)",

Dessert is my most favorite and it's the main reason why I come to this place. We agreed that for entree, the teriyaki steak, shrimp, chicken and chicken dumpling is our favorite choices.

I know this is a chain but it's one I'd never heard of and who doesn't like fondue?    The staff was excellent, attentive and explained everything you would want to know about how everything works. This is important because I believe the menu is slightly confusing about the pricing.  Basically here's the deal, if you want a 4 course meal (cheese fondue, meat fondue, salad and chocolate fondue) it's $50 per person.  I found that they give you WAY too much food per person.  When we were all set with the cheese course there was a boatload of fondue left (gone to waste).  We had the land and sea combo as our \"meat\" and again we left a lot of food behind.  This course was way better than I expected because everything came seasoned and with a really nice variety of dipping sauces.  My favorite was the beef with the blue cheese, which was delicious.  The chicken doesn't have a great texture when put into the oil.  I had 1 piece and was done with that.  I'd just do beef and shrimp next time.  I don't have much of a sweet tooth but I did have several pieces of fruit with the standard milk chocolate course.  It was very, very good.    If you go there remember a few things: 1. You need a reservation 2. if you're having multiple courses, plan to be there a while 3. make sure you know what you like and if you want all 4 courses, or customize your meal 4. boiled chicken is nasty 5. have fun, it's that kind of place",

    "text": "The Melting Pot is amazing but just make sure you allow enough time to eat if you have plans after. Dinner can take anywhere from 2-3 hours. We were there for 2 hours and 45 minutes and there was always food in front of us.  So, Wednesday's is the day to go in my opinion because you can build a 4 course wine flight for $10! So you get a different 3oz wine pour each course. It looked more like a 5 oz pour to be honest.  Make sure you make a reservation!  The ordering process can be confusing if you've never been here before but the wait staff does a great job explaining it. You pick your cheese course which comes with unlimited bread, apples, carrots and cauliflower for dipping. The cheese course is actually my favorite! You can opt out of the salad portion if you like but I really enjoy both of their salads. The house salad comes with a nice tangy dressing and I load up on the garlic and wine seasoning. That stuff is amazing! It's so amazing I bought some to bring home!  Next comes the entree. You have to choose a cooking style and your proteins. It comes with unlimited sides of mushrooms, potatoes, squash and broccoli . Not to mention an array of dipping sauces. My favorite is filling the mushroom caps with the green goddess! Yum! Final course is dessert. I think that's a lot of people's favorite. You pick the chocolate and they provide you with all sorts of delicious treats for dipping.  I've never had a bad meal here. I will be back! Can't wait to check them out during restaurant week to get a great deal !",

The melting pot is that place you go to in order to have a memorable fun experience . It can be super romantic and tucked into a nice corner booth like my first time or just with a good group of friends like this time for me.  There is something about cooking your own food and sharing with others that brings out the best in your collaborative decision making skills. If you don't like to share or to try a variety of different flavors and food don't go here! This place is great for trying all kinds of different foods especially with the different cooking sauces .   This is by far one of my favorite restaurants for restaurant week because you truly get a four course meal . (Salad counts as a meal to me) I would love to have like a regular loyalty card here full of discounts but who am I kidding there is no such thing. Restaurant week will have to do.  Now to the food... I love the fondue !!! So great to share and if you are a cheese lover dive in head first and don't look back.   Cooking your own food sounds like work but honestly it rewarding knowing you can actually make something without messing the microwave up or have to clean up after yourself.  Hands down my favorite thing here is the smores dessert! I am not a sweets kind of guy but they make me want to become one after tasting their chocolate!",

Our server was extremely nice and friendly. He's just started back to school for the year and was as chipper as can be. He made dining there very enjoyable. Helped out decide on what to get. Who doesn't love fondue. I enjoy dipping my food in the cheese and chocolate. So yummy. You definitely get full fast.

    "text": "Ok so I've been to this location twice and Melting Pot as a whole a couple of times so I think it's about time I wrote my review. The service has always been delightful and the staff has always brought their A game- no matter when I've been here. Both times I've came to this location was for Restaurant Week (January 2017/July 2016). I mean you can't really beat the RW special: Cheese fondue, side salad, entree and dessert for only $40! If you come here during a regular night and order that you will easily be spending close to double that!  For my cheese fondue, I've tried most of them, but my favorite is always the spinach and artichoke cheese. I know it's one of the most basic ones you can get, but it's perfect on everything- especially the cauliflower and tortilla chips! For my salad, you can't really go wrong with any of them, but my go to has been the house salad with their homemade dressing- a little sweet, but not too overpowering.  For the main event, you got to go with the half protein and seafood combo. I LOVE the salmon, but the filet is also really good. Add a little green goodness sauce into the mix and you have the perfect combo. By the way- when you cook your mushroom caps- add a little green goodness to the center of them when done- they will blow your mind! SO GOOD!! I could eat a million of those darn things.  The grand finale is the dessert fondue! My go to is the ying and yang because you get a mix of dark and while chocolate- can't go wrong. The bananas and rice krispies are awesome- and remember you can always order more side options with any of your fondue (excluding meat/fish) so go big!   ps. This location has 1/2 off wine on Thursday! Plus, their bar seating includes some cooking stove tops so you could always have dinner or some cheese/wine at the bar! Sounds like a win-win to me!",

    "text": "For my birthday our son's family of three children, plus he and wife and my wife and I had the fondue experience.  I last did fondue in probably the '80s, so it had been a long time.  In the 1970 and early '80s, fondue was very popular.  We had three fondue sets, with long forks, one for oil, one for cheese and another for chocolate.  If you got married in that time frame, you most likely had a fondue set or two in your wedding gifts.  Until I went here I thought that fondue places did not exist.  BUT, The Melting Place really does it right and I was very pleased to re-experience fondue the right, classy and classic way.  We waited for the gang to arrive in their excellent bar.  And the drink selections were unique along with a bar tender who knew what, in this case, he, was doing.  Really detailed concoctions shaken and poured with the appropriate razz-a-ma-taz. A pleasure.  Seated upstairs at a large table the menu was a bit confusing but the wait staff walked us through it and the decoding worked for us.  We had an appetizer fondue of cheese sauces.  There were at least six of them to choose from.  Excellent blends although we only ordered two of them.  I was surprised at how the grandchildren loved the experience.  Ages 4, 8 & 11 they were well-mannered and were mostly able to help themselves.  It was a nice feeling.  The main courses offered a multitude of meat and veggie combination that you cooked, literally, in hot oil set on counter top heaters.  You could also broth to cook with and that we did, so the children cooked in broth, adults in oil.  Safer for children.  I ate my fill, which surprised me as I never recall being full at earlier fondue parties or at home. And as I sat sated, they brought dessert!  And you might have guessed that there are at least six types of chocolate to dip cake, fruit and brownies (!) into the chocolate blends.  We did two chocolate blends and they were both excellent.  What surprised me was the portion sizes of sauces was just enough for the amount of dipping food provided.  The cheese pots were just about empty and so with the chocolate.  Very good planning and it was more than enough for a table of four adults and three kiddos.  A great evening and we highly recommend the experience.  And this is an excellent first date place, as well as a regular date place.  There is an intimacy in dipping food and eating it from long forks.",

Our server, Kevin was attentive, but not so prompt. I did see he had quite a few tables and since our table was upstairs, I will cut him some slack.   To the food...I honestly think the cheese fondue and the dark chocolate were the only good thing.  For the proteins, we had the 2 orders of the filet mignon, blackened ahi tuna and chicken.  The filet was extremely chewy, it tasted more like a sirloin. And with the chicken they accidentally gave us some pork which tasted terrible.  I will leave the Melting Pot to those lovely youngsters or prom goers. Or to those to absolutely have never been, because it is a cool experience.",

I trust they wanted to just garner all the feedback possible to improve not like some badgering or luring me kind of reach out. Although, I'm not opposed to luring when it comes to the Melting Pot because I've bought several St. Jude coupons/gift cards and they've expired and I'd love to use them just to have a Creme Brulee dessert.   I did solo for Father's Day Sunday to make up for what was missed in the ATL the night before and because the ATL offerings did leave me wanting more dips and dessert. Anywhoo, if you book here there's always a card that has to go on file for cancellations and what not.   I was seated upstairs for the first time ever and I liked it just as much... again hidden alcoves. Anywhoo, some diners were gleefully loud but whatever enjoy your Father's Day folks.   I think an AGM or some one in management took my order and that's because I knew what I wanted upon seating. And my server was trying to be chatty but came off more aloof - idk. Maybe it's me. At any rate, the real issue was at the \"end\" of the dinner course or so one server thought - he kept trying to turn off the fire and take things away. I was moving slow because it was literally just me and my manual. Anywhoo, that doesn't take a star away it's just there's room for greater to get that 5 star from me.   I will say the server had great pacing and that can be replicated so others get it, too.  Valet was gone or over upon arrival for a 8pm reservation but it's fine because the lot is right there.   Oh, I hadn't left so the server swang back around with a HFD gift. It was the house seasoning that I'm passing along to the 'rents when I go home.",

Most of the melting pots we have gone to have somewhat private seating areas but this one was a little bit more open. This took away some of the specialness of the restaurant.  My wife got one of their holiday cocktails ( the Elf) which she did not care for. She really liked the eggnog cocktail. Our server was pleasant and did all the normal rituals of the Melting pot server.  The food was good as always and the desert was delightful. The price was expensive, but it was a good meal.

She just got cleared to go out in public and we decided on visiting an old favorite.  We have been coming here for special occasions for over 15 years, so it's about time I write a review.  We would have picked the melting pot regardless but it being restaurant week was a bonus.  All three of us ordered the classic which had chicken, shrimp, tenderloin, salmon and herb crusted pork.  The 4 course meal was $35  Our favorite cheese is the Wisconsin Trio. You are provided a board with an assortment of breads, pepper rings, apples, grapes and carrots   Had the flaming turtle chocolate.  The food is always amazing and cooked perfectly   The best thing about this location has always been the service and tonight did not disappoint!",

If you are so generous to take the \"little one's\", kids absolutely love it.  A couple of recommendations: Cheese fondue and the chocolate deserts.

Recently my daughter turned 24 and we asked her where she wanted to go for dinner and no surprise The Melting Pot was her #1 choice! We were a party of 4, since the table has one large cooking/fondue pot, we all had to agree on a cooking style, our favorite is the Coq Au Vin, wine based. Two of us ordered the 4 course and two ordered the Create your own Entree. Needless to say the experience was top notch in large part to our excellent waiter - he handled our every need the entire evening! If you have never tried a fondue type establishment your in for a surprise and I highly recommend the Melting Pot on Kings Drive!",

Restaurant week is a good deal but this time we went as a celebration.  Melting pot asks about whether you are celebrating an anniversary, event, birthday, etc.  They also ask if you have any food allergies, which is an added perk for those that do!  You cook/dip all of your food into a fondue pot.  It's actually really fun and feels like you are eating so much more food because it comes out in courses.  I always pick my own (choose 3).  It is a lot of food. Cheers to those that can eat 4 meats in the four course meal.  It can be overwhelming if it's your first time because you have to order everything at once except for the dessert.   I always go with the Wisconsin cheese.  They bring out a tray of veggies, apples, and bread.  Remember you can request more veggies if you want!    I get the California salad, my husband gets the Caesar.  The salads are fresh and delicious.   I LOVE LOVE LOVE the teriyaki steak.  It's really hard for me to get other meats because I think it's so delicious.   I usually double up on that and then pick a third item.  It changes every time.  For sauces the goddess is everything.  I need like three plates of that sauce.... seriously.   For dessert I go with the turtle and always request extra brownies because they taste sooo incredible.    Melting pot is SUCH a treat for me and my husband.  I love the experience and the ambiance.  We were celebrating a new job and Daniel our incredible waiter brought out a cute little cake a chocolate that said congratulations.  What a special touch to our meal.",

On this visit I made a reservation for 4 on OpenTable. I received an email from Melting Pot advertising their special cheese fondue for April 11th and 12th for $4.11. So I rushed to make a reservation because they always feel up. I was only able to reserve a table for 4.   Upon arriving we were quickly seated at our table and our server arrive no more than 3/4 minutes after we sat down. He went thru the spill and I advised him that this was a trail for my aunt and nephew to see if it was worth them coming back for the full fondue meal.  We ordered the Original World Champ cheese fondue and the Melting Pot House Salad. I also upgraded and got The Premium Cheese Fondue Dippers. This was a small platter of The Artisanal Italian Meats, tiny pickles and peppers for the cheese.   It wasn't long before our server was back with the salad and the cheese for the fondue pot. I got both the peppercorn ranch and the tangy house salad dressing on the side and mixed them both on the salad. It was a very nice blend and my nephew devoured the salad. Our cheese fondue had a white wine base, shallots, dion mustard and scallions. The flavor was very strong. It was a very mature taste and my nephew didn't eat much of it. The Artisanal Italian Meats came with tiny little pickles and sweet peppers. They really complimented the sharpness of the cheese.   Overall I'm very thankful for the cheese special and our server understanding this was a trail visit! I hate we didn't do a chocolate fondue but I will be back very soon for that.

The ambiance was GREAT!  It was lovely because we could really enjoy the fondue experience.  The music was modern and was playing at the right volume.  You could hear it in the background but could stilll have conversation at our table.     Sari was our waiter and he most definitely took care of us throughout the night.  He was personable, had good recommendations and was very comfortable with the menu.  When I go back, I will ask to sit in his section!   Wednesdays you can choose a flight of 4 wines for $10... SIGN ME UP!! 4 wines paired with the 4 courses... I picked the following and was very happy with my selections: 1) Kendal Jackson Chardonnay 2) Schmitt Sohne Riesling 3) Portillo Malbec 4) Meomi Pinot Noir   We originally came here on Wednesday night for the celebration of National Cheese Fondue Day for a price of $4.11/a person.  The original plan was to have cheese and dessert but Sari told us about the 4 course meal special for $29.99/person and we immediately changed our plans to that.    Cheese:  we elected to have the Sherry Cherry.  It had the spinach, sherry, sherry Infused cherries and almonds.  Went well with the apples, bread and veggies.  Mouth watering Delish!    Salad: I had the California salad, my favorite and my forever choice each time that I visit MP.  It had greens, gorgonzola cheese (YUM!) , candied pecans, and raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  It's my favorite because I like the combination of sweet and tart.  Dressing amount is perfect - not too little not too much!   Main Entree:  we chose the Coq au vin cooking style ($5.95) simply because we love mushrooms and you can taste the wine and spices that are in the mix.    The special dinner entree was the Land and Sea (steak, shrimp and chicken).   Loved all of the dipping sauces with the exception of the cocktail sauce because it was SUPER SPICY, as in clear your sinuses, make your eyes water and drink an entire glass of water spicy all in one!  Just when I thought that I was going to bust at the seams, it was time to order desert.  We chose the Dark and Dulce, it's Caramel-Like and has a couple of shakes of salt in it.  The chocolate was great but I would've preferred a couple MORE shakes of salt.  I like extremes and like the sweet and salty too!  The items to dip in the chocolate were wonderful... Bananas, strawberries, rice crispy treats, brownies - I was just too stuffed but that's no ones fault but mine.   Takeaways:  Plan accordingly - this is an full on fondue experience.  Before we knew it - we'd been here three hours, time just flew by between making course decisions, eating and good conversation.    Sari - this guy was great!  He made the great experience, that much better!   Parking was plentiful.",

    "text": "This was my second time going to a Melting Pot and I would say it was average on service. We were a party of 7 so being an odd number I think our portions were a bit off. We waited a very long time for our first course.  We had plenty to talk about but we came to eat and we had a 5:15 reservation.  On a few occasions we asked our server for some things and he never followed through.  That is a big pet peeve of mine.   When you are paying $45 a head service should be impeccable.  This was not that.   Our cheese course we had one winner and one loser. The winner was the bacon chedder. The loser was the brie and pear. I think the brie pot truly did not get up to temp because it didn't have enough water in the bottom pot and the fondue ultimately  didn't come together, another server error.  Nothing to note on salads, I was told they were fine.  I can't eat salad so I was given extra fruit.   The mains were okay, although my husband and I found the seasame crusted tuna to have too much crust.  We ended up scrapping most of it off before cooking.    The desert course for all of us was the best course! We opted for dark and smorses chocolate.  We also had extra sweets.  Our only gripe was that they did not give us enough chocolate for 7 people.  It was gone in about ten minutes.  What a disappointment, especially for a birthday celebration.  We had a table full of dippers and no chocolate to dip it in.    This was fun but there were definite problems. For my husband and I ordering our own meals was waaaay too much food.  IF we ever came back on our own we would order one four course with extra sweet and split it.",

    "text": "Its pretty safe to say that The Melting Pot is my favorite chain restaurant. I have never had a bad experience and this location is no exception. Two warnings:  1. Don't expect to get in and out fast, take your time 2. Don't expect a cheap meal If you are ok with that, this place is an awesome 2-3 hour dining experience experience. Its a perfect spot for a date with a very romantic ambiance where you can take your time and enjoy a unique dining experience. The servers always really know how to do their jobs and are happy to help show you the ropes and offer great recomendations. I always like going for 4 courses but all 4 really aren't necessary, its still a great experience to just go for desert or pick any 2 courses. If you go for just cheese and chocolate, you can always add a board of cured meats to dip in the cheese and you wont leave hungry.   I highly recommend getting an entree with a good bit of variety, try everything from the filet to the shrimp to (my personal favorite) the mushrrom sacchettis. All the entrees are served with 6 sauces and each one will completely change every meat and veggie you pull out of the pot. The servers commonly recommend it anyway but mixing the curry and teriyaki sauce is delicious! For every other course, you really can't go wrong. I've never picked a cheese, salad or chocolate that I haven't liked.  Overall, this is consistently a fantastic dining experience and I am always excited to make another visit",

My daughter who is celiac just went there with a few friends and they took really good care of her asked that we go again to celebrate my birthday.  I haven't been in about 8 years, so why not?  Made reservations on OpenTable and everything was fine there.  We arrived after fighting I-77 traffic on a Friday evening and we were seated immediately.  We were in the room with separate tables with a large party and a few other groups.  The waiter came over and greeted us and explained everything which with 3 people, all different eating preferences (Celiac, pescaterian, and meat lover) could be a bit daunting.    2 burners, to start we had the spinach and artichoke and Wisconsin cheese.  Both were really good.  Loved the spinach and artichoke flavor.  They provided a separate plate of gluten free items for my daughter which was a nice touch.  Salad was basic salad and nothing special I did like the house dressing though which was a honey mustard type dressing.    Meats I did the shrimp, filet, sausage and dumplings.  All tasty with the mojo cooking style.  I liked the mojo but thought it could be more mojo, you know?  I did like the different sauces and dressings and think that even though they haven't changed over the years it's still a good flavor experience.  Dessert was, of course, heavenly.  Flaming turtle and chocolate mint.  Again, they took care of my daughter eliminating cross contamination and we all left with our bellies full.  The Melting Pot isn't an every day thing for us, but always a fun experience that I recommend.",

    "text": "Two days after our visit to The Melting Pot, my husband and I are still talking about how amazing our experience was. I have always wanted to go, so we went for my birthday on 9/28, unsure of what to expect. I browsed the menu before arriving- not only because I do that before going to any restaurant, but also to try to prepare myself as it seemed like a complicated menu. Despite our newbie status, our waiter, Dave Y., was friendly and patient and guided us through the menu with skill. I cannot say enough good things about our service! Yes, it is an expensive meal, but their \"Ultimate Four-Course meal\" is a must-do at least once for anyone who goes.  The cheddar fondue was to die for, and for the \"Ultimate\" meal we chose the premium meats for the cheese, and we were very happy with that choice. The strawberry salad was light and refreshing, a nice break before the main course. We went with the Mojo-style cooking broth, which was very tasty and complimented out meat choices nicely (we chose duck, chicken, pork, and filet, as well as the ravioli. Also included were veggies and potatoes). All of the dipping sauces were perfect. Finally, the portion of the meal we were both looking forward to most, the chocolate, was as amazing as we both expected it to be. Out of all the chocolates, we quickly decided on the flaming turtle and enjoyed every piece of dessert and bite of chocolate!  We were both expecting to be completely stuffed by the end of the meal, and even though it was a lot of food, it was the right amount for each course. We left feeling full but not bursting at the seams. A final note, for us the entire meal took about 2 and a half hours, so be sure to allow ample time- don't arrive at 9pm unless you don't mind staying up late! I am big on the \"experience\" of going out to eat- if I am taking the time and money to eat outside of my home, I don't want to be rushed and I want to enjoy the time, and The Melting Pot met and exceeded my expectations for dining out!",

We love the Melting Pot- it's always fun. Why is cooking at a restaurant fun, but home not so much??? My wife did fondu delight, and her filet and lobster were very  good. I love the French Quarter because of the andouille, and I added the Pacific Rim's duck. The duck was my favorite. Dessert has been improved by removing the cheesecake in favor of pineapple and blondies. The old cheesecake seemed superfluous- I mean you couldn't dip it. BUT, Chelsea brought a cheesecake with some sort of ignitable aerosol sugar spray business- nothin' wrong with that. One caveat: those steps are steep dress and drink accordingly.",

I always get the Ultimate 4 course selection because it allows me to have a variety of flavors to experiment with. I like to change it up each time, but my favorite is definitely the starter of Gruyere cheese and meats with beef filet, duck and chicken. I was hesitant to see if I would indeed cook the meat enough to eat it, but to my surprise and thanks to the very helpful staff, it turned out amazing! I opted for the the Strawberry salad because it cleansed my palette and also was very light and refreshing to not weigh me down between courses. The Mojo cooking method is a definite not only for the flavor you can pack into the meat, chopped veggies and potatoes, but also the aromatics are beyond delightful! The sauces were very well paired for the main entree and I definitely enjoyed being able to make my own creation in a way and cook it to order with customized flavor because each person may like a little more or less seasoning. The dessert, let's just say one of a kind! We chose the chocolate fondue and then came the pieces of yummy cake, fruits like strawberries and bananas! Not only was it fun to be able to help \"cook\" your meal, but its okay to get your hands a little messy... especially with the chocolate! The service was impeccable and very knowledgeable with answering questions. I would definitely recommend reservations because they can get busy fast and also check out the menu online to kind of get the feel of what to expect! I even bought a fondue set for home after having so much fun and delicious creations!",

As you probably know this is a DIY style cooking that breaks down into three courses, cheese, seafood & meats and chocolates to finish it off.  Always top shelf cheese and the meat and seafood are fresh and delicious.  There are several types of chocolate fondue to choose from and seriously you can't go wrong with any of them!  Next time I visit I think I'm just going to stick with the cheeses and chocolates....seriously, the meat and seafood is great but just doesn't compare to the level of tastiness of the other two.

I have always heard great things about the Melting Pot and have been wanting to try it out for the longest time.  The hostess and the waitresses were both amazing.  They were really good and patient with us considering it was our first time there, and we all had no clue what we were doing.    We started out with the Appetizer course.  We got to pick 2 types of cheeses for dipping our Bread, apples, and fresh vegetables.  We chose the Wisconsin Trio & the Fondue a la France.  I think the consensus was that the Wisconsin Trio was better, but they both were delightful. Next we all got to pick a salad.  I chose the Caesar.  Next we moved onto our Entrees.  We either got to choose between...   The Coastal which included blackened scallops, cedar plank salmon, breast of chicken, teriyaki sirloin, white shrimp, and spinach & artichoke ravioli    or  The French which included filet mignon, chicken Provencal, roasted garlic shrimp, peppercorn NY Strip, ratatouille & goat cheese ravioli, and asparagus  Since there was 6 of us in the party, 3 of us chose The Coastal, and 3 of us chose The French so we could just taste and mis-match them all.  They give you the choice of two kinds of dipping broth to use to cook all of your entrees.  We chose the Coq au Vin and Court Bouillon. I personally enjoyed the filet mignon, chicken Provencal, goat cheese ravioli, teriyaki sirloin, and spinach & artichoke ravioli.  After all this, we moved on to the Dessert course. We got to choose two types of Chocolate dipping sauces.  First was the DISARONNO Meltdown which is Silky white chocolate swirled with Disaronno Originale Amaretto and second was the Flaming Turtle which is Milk chocolate, caramel and chopped pecans.  Yum Yum and more Yum!!!  They are served with cheesecake, pound cake, brownies, marshmallows, Rice Krispies treats, bananas and strawberries.  After all that I think we were all ready to take a big nap.... and were busting at the seams of our pants!!! Haha.  I have to say I highly recommend this place, not just for the amazing food, but the experience.  This was a 3 hour dinner that seemed like an hour.  The laughing and the fun of cooking and dipping your own food was so enjoyable.  This place is great for a good group of friends or even a date night between two people.  And just one more thing... Since your cooking the food right at your table, your going to smell like your food, so I highly recommend not wearing clothing that isn't easy to wash into the Melting Pot, and also leave your jacket in your car..... lol.",

I love melty chocolate. I don't *mind* throwing a few veggies into a crockpot of chicken broth and hanging out for a little while. Plus, they have a decent drink list and great variety of offerings & meal combinations.   The service at this particular Melting Pot is typically solid and they are great at handling substitutions. Don't like broccoli? They'll sub out for another veggie. Scallops get you down? Sub in some bird. Oh, and I haven't mentioned it yet, but the Green Goddess cream cheese/sour cream/herby sauce for the veggies is so good I want to marry it.  Whether you want just a cheese fondue or you're going full on three course, Melting Pot is solid & delicious.",

We ate at the bar and enjoyed the October special (monday-friday, hopefully it's a recurring special). For $32, we got salad, cheese fondue and most importantly chocolate fondue.  The jalapeno cheese is tasty, but the chocolate fondue is deliciousapuss. It was just enough for us food wise that night. The rice krispie treats, brownies and strawberries in chocolate are my favorite.   As far as sitting at the bar, it definitely loses most of the romantic feel with the bartender making drinks constantly and a tv in front of you, but i guess that's why they offer the special at the bar, and i'm okay with that.",

The creamy spinach artichoke cheese dip, minced walnut melted milk chocolate, and mixture of marinated meats were incredibly delicious but what earns this place without any doubt 5 Stars instead 3 or 4, is their incredible service.  Richard our server was sociable and almost too considerate lol (we stayed to 1:20am even though this place closed at 11pm!!!).  Steve the manager treated my girlfriend and I with a card signed by most of the restaurant staff and some treats to make the anniversary of our 1st date really special.  This place isn't for the cheap at heart or those with quality taste but don't have a lot of spending cash on them.  Definitely GO!! but I would suggest you go if you: 1) are in a group bigger than 4 2) just don't mind spending more than $20-40 on an entree 3) want to try something different/new 4) are looking to make a romantic occasion really special (let the restaurant know about your special occasion) 5) or want to treat someone you care about who is isn't particular in general, to something they haven't tried before",

I've had a few great dates here (even better when I'm not paying!), and it's also a lot of fun for families. It's neat to watch the staff mix the ingredients up, and the food is always delicious. It's a lot of fun and interactive, and my 5 year old niece always enjoys herself when we go here. It's her second favorite after the Japanese steakhouse style of entertainment eating.   Also, the desserts are absurd and outrageous and amazing. Don't leave without eating one.  To keep the sticker shock down, try not to let the staff upsale you with beer or wine. They make a great case, and sometimes forget to mention the price of what you're ordering.",

Here's what I normally go with - the four choice classic:  - Wisconsin Trio Cheese Fondue - oh my...I could just eat the cheese by itself! :D However, it does come with vegetables, granny smith apples & various bread for dipping.   - Spinach mushroom salad - the spinach & mushrooms always look fresh & that Shallot Vinagrette dressing is so yummy!  - Entree (cooked in the coq au vin style) of ahi tuna, shrimp, sirloin, chicken breast & teriyaki-marinated sirloin.   - Dessert - Flaming turtle. This is just like the turtle candy; chocolate, caramel & chopped pecans. Of course, you get strawberries, bananas, cheesecake, Rice Krispie treats, marshmallows, pound cake & brownies.   Wow! So much food, but so worth it.  Yes, it's pricey, so you may want to save this \"big night out\" for special occasions.  This location is the \"older\" one in Charlotte & not really my favorite one of the two Charlotte locations. I've been to this one twice & haven't had any issues - both times I had reservations & they were on time. The staff is always friendly & attentive.",

So I got a bite of steak and a piece of broccoli every 5 minutes, bc I was waiting on my wife and daughter to cook their stuff! Also not very kid friendly! I thought it would be fun for my daughter but all they had to choose from was chicken, salmon, steak, or butternut squash pasta.  Not exactly her favorite. The only way I would go back is to just have a drink and some cheese dip. Also we were there for 3 hours!!",

Imagine yourself a plate with strawberries and bananas and velvet cake and other cakes and pastry that you can dip in the melted chocolate. Staff is all around friendly and effecient.   In general I liked it. I'd say it can be a good romantic place for couples. Find time when you are not in rush and can spend and enjoy the food and each others company for about 3 hours since you'll be cooking in the pots right in front of you on your table. Can be a good unrushed experience. Thanks Melting Pot!",

Be prepared though..if you're with a group, you have to make decisions that everyone will enjoy...what cheese course, what cooking technique and which dessert fondue.  In the cheese and chocolate fondues, all you have to do is dip and eat,  For the entree, you have to allow your meats and veggies to cook and this is a little more difficult than it sounds.  Be prepared for lost veggies and meats.  With 8 forks in the pot, something's bound to get lost in there sometimes.    Food + Fondue = Fun.   But this is definitely a splurge place and not something you'd want to do every week.",

    "text": "And the winner goes to........The Melting Pot.  For the cliff notes version :  This is our first time here - together. ( It has been years, since my last visit) Food was cooked to perfection ( I cooked my own food - of course) Service was impeccable. (Will was great) Price was reasonable for individual entrees. Desert is the only reason we went.....(strawberries smothered in chocolate)  Now for the main attraction.  We placed our reservations online. It was very easy and we received an email confirmation shortly thereafter.  The day of the reservation, I was contacted via phone to confirm the reservation.  Upon entering the restaurant we were promptly greeted by two young ladies, I am under the impression that one was the manager.  We were promptly seated in a very secluded booth but was closest to the \"kitchen area\". ( Not sure that you can really call it a kitchen if you do not cook there- imo)  Our server was Will.  He was very prompt, and informative regarding the menu, the entrees and the sauces. Will was right on top of our drinks, he kindly informed us that if we needed any additional items he would take care of them. I took advantage of the mushrooms,as they went so well with the green goddess sauce.  Our entrees were as followed:  The Filet Mignon, and the Signature Special (3 pieces of chicken, 3 white shrimp, 2 Teriyaki Sirloin, and 2 salmon) Vegetables consisted of potato wedges,broccoli, and mushroom caps. Both individual meals came with a house salad.  ( I have added pictures)  Our dessert was the small milk chocolate ($16.00 ) it featured pineapple, marshmellos, bananas, rice crispy treats, cheesecake, brownies, pound cake, and my favorite strawberries.  What I gained in weight  from food was balanced by the weight I lost in my wallet, but hey, we only live once.  Overall this was a great dining experience, we were asked twice by different people if this was a special occasion, and we stated that it was not.  This would make for a nice,  quiet /aka romantic location due to the high tables,and secluded rooms,but we were just here to show off my mean \"fondue skills\".  NCFoodGuy",

We came in a little before the restaurant was open so we enjoyed a glass of wine with the great bartender while we waited for our table. If you have a choice, ask for Chris. He was very attentive and explained the menus to a bunch of fondu newbies. He and kelly were working a room together so we were always taken care of. The food was amazing. We came in to try the Restaurant week menu and we were not disappointed.  As good as the food was, I cannot rave enough about the service. The staff wrote me a card to congratulate me on the engagement and brought a candle on our desert dippers for our birthday girl in the group. So incredibly happy with everything that I had to let you all know the moment I got home! Thank you melting pot!",

    "text": "Despite years of resisting this place because it is a both a chain and the idea of cooking my own food, table side, did not overly appeal to me, I relented and joined another couple for dinner all in the name of charity, and limitless cheese and chocolate.    For a chain, this place still does a nice job of feeling high quality with subtle lighting and service that is truly top notch.  And for the prices charged, this is as it should be.  My only complaint is the hostess took a phone call that apparently involved a complicated reservation and we were left standing for several minutes without a greeting or other recognition.  A small point, but couldn't the caller have been put on hold till we were whisked off to our own reservation?  I got to try a couple of different cheese dips, broths and meats for the main course, and no less than 4 different types of chocolate fondue.  All came with plenty of accompanying items to drop into the fondues.  Vegetables were basic: broccoli, cauliflower and carrots.  Apples and grapes were a nice twist.  With the chocolate we had fresh bananas and strawberries that were a bit less fresh.  We also had squares of poundcake and rice crispy treats.  They brought more of what was popular, as much as we asked for.  No one should suffer for a lack of food here.  My issue really centers around the meats.  We had an endless deal, so I got to try a lot of different things, but here's the way it generally works: you get a meat (sometimes pre-seasoned) and cook it in a broth or an oil.  That broth may have a plain base of might be flavored with another set of seasonings. Once done, you put your meat on a small plate that has room for up to 6 different dipping sauces, all with another set of seasonings.  That's up to 3 different seasonings in the finished project.  Muddled and confusing?  Yeah, to say the least.  Can you narrow it down?  Of course, but that's hardly discouraged at the time you order.  I like the concept, especially if you have a long time to sit down for dinner.  Our complete dinner lasted just over 3 hours.  It makes for great conversation with a small group.  However, when paying a minimum of $30 a head for dinner I'd like to think I'm paying for a chef's skill and training in producing good food.  Here you get all the basic building blocks and do the final work yourself.  I know it's novel, and some folks get excited for the change, but it's a off-putting to me.  If that's what you go for, however, this location will give you the full experience and make sure you are comfortable and served with care.  I'd easily go back for dessert, and maybe that alone.",

Perfect service for our party of 10, food was great,  everything exactly as it should be.   Flawless reservation and group planning experience as well.   They make it easy to host a nice dinner.   It's a rare occasion that the host can have as much fun as the guests.   Highly recommend.",

They were all good and it was awesome to hang out with them. However, we could have hung out with each other for a lot cheaper and for a lot better food at other places.",

    "text": "I have been here three times, just recently during Charlotte Restaurant week.  I absolutely love this place, obviously don't come often, as it is pricey but you get a lot of food!  It doesn't seem like much, but when you get a four course meal, the little stuff adds up quickly!  Plus you can always ask for as many extras as you want with the cheese and chocolate fondues for no extra charge.  So be prepared to eat alot and leave stuffed!  During my lastest adventure to the Melting Pot, I called to ask for reservations and asked for a little more private or secluded booth as to not be out in the open and enjoy a nice romantic dinner.  They delivered, put us upstairs in a booth secluded from others.  The staff there always seems very nice, knowledgable, and just great all around.  Great Service!   The Cheese, I've had the fiesta, spinach artichoke, and one of the specials they were running.  Fiesta was definitely my favorite, but I liked them all.  Can't go wrong with cheese!  Salads, I've had the house, ceasar, and spinach salads.  All good, but I think I prefer their caesar.  They do put some kind of garlic or some kind of seeds in their ceasar salads - something different, but good!  Meats and Cooking - all have been good for the most part.  Although this last time, I didn't care for how their chicken was flavored, I enquired about it, and it actually had a hint of chocolate on it! We have always upgraded our cooking style, coq a vin is what I've had two of the three times and I really like it, especially with the flavoring of the vegetables.  Now onto the chocolate.  That of course is my favorite.  I love to dip the strawberries, rice krispy treats, and cheesecake with the chocolate!  I would have never thought of rice krispy treats, but they are just delightful!  Even have asked for extra of those!  My favorite chocolate hands down is the turtle - chocolate with caramel and nuts, yummy!   I can't wait until my next visit!",

    "text": "I feel about fondue about the way I feel about eating blue crabs. The work, reward ratio is rarely worth it to me so consider any review I do of a fondue place to be colored by this frame of reference.   That said, Melting Pot does a pretty good job of the standard cheese, veggie/protein, chocolate line-up.  Went last night with a team of 15 or so from work. While we had a menu already selected for us, it included 5 different cheeses and 5 different chocolate fondues to start/end the meal so, tons of variety. The rest of the meal was a salad choice and then a plate of meats/veggies oil or broth to cook them in and 6 different sauces to dip everything in.   I always enjoy the cheese portion the most. The preparation here ranged from excellent to average with the average being a 3 cheese blend where they were way too heavy handed with the wine at the start so that was the dominant flavor by far.",
