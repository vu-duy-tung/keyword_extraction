I love Charlotte just as much as I love Chicago, but when I saw Potbelly's it brought back all the memories. Potbelly's is a great sandwich shop. If you don't want to get a sandwich, you can get a salad. If your feeling a sweet tooth coming on then try the awesome milk shake with a butter cookie to top it off. And if your feeling in a really good mood or down try the mini chocolate chip cookies. I guarantee your spirits will perk up then. I say just try it out. If you don't like, you don't like it. There are plenty of places in Charlotte I don't like. This place is not like wich-wich.",

    "text": "After having a few Potbelly sandwiches years ago in DC, I was ecstatic when I discovered there would be one opening within walking distance of my Uptown Charlotte office! So on grand opening day, a few co-workers and I headed over to the new S. Tryon location to try to beat the line.   We got there at the perfect time (11:10am) right before the line weaved on out the door. We were welcomed by an employee with brownie samples, as well as printed menus in order to start figuring out which yummy sandwich we were going to order. Once we got up to the ordering counter, it was sort of chaotic. The guy taking orders was very upbeat and quick on his feet, which enabled the line to keep on moving. After that it was a little confusing. Being vertically challenged myself, I could not see over the tall shelves which house the chips, and the sandwich maker behind the counter could not see me to ask me how I would like to continue making my sandwich (might have to wear heels next time). After rolling through the toaster, my sandwich was handed off to 1 of 4 people working the next station, where I opted to add lettuce and mustard to my grilled chicken and cheddar sandwich. At completion, my sandwich was handed to me where I took it and my chip bag of choice to the next available cashier. Paying was easy and then I could take my tray over to the drink fountain to fill up my cup (chips and drink were extra, there doesn't seem to be a \"combo\" option).   My sandwich lived up to the hype, and my co-workers seemed to be genuinely surprised by the quality of food as well. We chose to dine in and sit along the stylish Charlotte skyline bench, and enjoy the live music that was being played inside the restaurant for the grand opening. Right after I had finished my delicious lunch that I had been waiting months to have, the owner of this new location came around and asked us about our food and experience. He was very attentive, and genuinely interested in our opinions, and even offered to take our trays back for us.  This new Charlotte, NC location did not sacrifice the food quality that Potbelly has to offer, and I'm excited to have this new spot on the convenient stretch of S. Tryon St through uptown Charlotte.",

    "text": "Well, I might be a little biased since this was one of my go to sandwich shops in college. However no matter the location or the time of day the potbelly franchise never seems to disappoint.  I decided to try this location out during prime lunchtime in uptown Charlotte... Which could be a risky move being that it is located right in the heart of the business world uptown. But (not to my surprise) The service was fast, friendly and RIGHT! When you have a continuous line that's snaked through your business it can be hard to keep your service on point at all times, especially during lunch \"rush-hour.\"  This location, just like many of the others, was staffed with a generous amount of employees who were all friendly and accommodating throughout your experience. They do a really great job keeping the line moving in making sure your order is correct. I mean, you would think when sandwiches are made in front of you it is hard to mess up, but that isn't always the case, so I always appreciate that extra TLC from my sandwich artist.  Although my go-to is the pizza sandwich here (which I always plan to try something else, but always default to what I know and love), everyone I go with get something else and I've never heard a complaint! Not to mention I took a to potbelly newbies with me when I went to this location and without a doubt they will be back! The only thing we all agreed on is that we wish we could get larger sandwiches because every time you finish you want more!  Job well done on keeping the franchise on top of the sandwich game and staying one of my favorite sandwich shops regardless of what location I visit across the country!!",

This location was an epic fail, and did not do any justice to the brand.  I ordered via the app and it crashed on me the first time. I requested a pick up time of 1:00 -1:15 and arrived at the location a little after 1:00. I gave my name at the pickup station and waited. And waited. And waited. No one spoke to me other than to ask if I had ordered a salad (which I hadn't; I ordered the Mediterranean. Finally, one of the Sandwich artists brought my order. I asked if it had just been made (I wanted to make sure it was hot still). He said, no, they just couldn't find the order. Left the shop and went back to work. By the time I opened the bag and started to eat, the sandwich was cold and tasted like the paper it was wrapped in. So not what I expect from Potbelly's. I'll give this location one more try. If they fail again, I won't return.",

I do not have any fond memories of eating this for lunch when I lived somewhere else, like the other reviewers do. Perhaps the nostalgia is clouding judgment.  It reminds me of Which-Wich in the taste and type of sandwich, but with far less options and more expensive for a smaller sandwich. The bread is ok, but not good. Another review mentioned there isn't really anything interesting about the sandwiches and I completely agree. Their signature seems to be milkshakes, but that's sort of a weird thing to have in the middle of a workday during a quick lunch.   It is new, and it is packed, but the service was very good. The long line didn't take as long as I would have thought, but it still took awhile.   Overall, this place is ok but not good. It's generic fast food sandwiches that are equal to the plethora of other fast food sandwich options. I would not seek it out amongst others and would much rather have a good Italian deli Uptown to service my sandwich needs.",

I got the grilled chicken and cheddar sandwich on wheat bread. You have your choice between the standard toppings to add for free, like your seasoning, lettuce, tomato, etc., but you have to pay extra for anything beyond that. My sandwich was toasted to perfection, cut in half, and tasted amazing!  Their menu is pretty extensive, and I've seen a few shakes that look intriguing on their menu. I hope to explore this spot a bit more! Thanks guys.",

    "text": "Very dissatisfied. Ordered 2 of the pizza sandwiches online said it would be ready between 2:40-2:55. When we arrived at 2:40 no one was in the store and they had not started our order . I also ordered a cookie and asked for it to be warmed up. The staff was confused and initially could not figure out how to warm the cookie up. When we finally got our sandwiches neither had any marinara sauce. The sandwiches were so dry. I was looking forward to Potbelly's. Now I'm not at all .",

The chicken cheddar with real Chicago hot peppers is a must have, the staff is incredible and food comes out quick (unless you hit the 11:45 rush in which case you can always use the app).  Definitely a must try lunch spot if you work in the city.",

The soups are tasty as well and come in a decent size container for the price, broccoli cheddar is my fave! Parking can be very difficult in Uptown during the week, so if you plan on stopping in, plan ahead for driving around to find street parking. Downside is the rush during peak lunch hours, dinner hours, and game days. Also, majority of the staff are not assertive and you have to be paying attention to get your sandwich ordered correctly.",

They were quick to make my sandwich and even heat up my cookie for me! This potbelly wasn't as crowded as others, so maybes that's why I received my food so fast, but it was awesome customer service.  The seating here is smaller than some that I've been too, but the layout is great and easy to navigate.  I forgot to take pictures here, but I can tell you my sandwich and Mac and cheese were awesome. (Highly recommend the Mac and cheese and the double chocolate cookie).  The restaurant was clean and ingredients were fresh. I will definitely be back if I'm ever in town!",

This place was great, there are lots of sandwich options and each sandwich is customizable to your taste.   I got the Mediterranean sandwich with chicken. It was very good. I added a few things to my sandwich, including the Potbelly hot peppers. I would recommend these to anyone that loves a kick in their sandwich. I also got the mac and cheese side, which was good.   Great sandwich spot in the heart of downtown Charlotte, would highly recommend.",

    "text": "Being that the company I work for is based out of Chicago, I've had Potbellys once in a blue moon while working out of the mothership.  It's funny when folks from our Chicago office visit due to our location in Charlotte has a lot of the same chain restaurants that surround our Chicago office.  Either way, I was sad to see my Salsaritas spot go, but having the location in the Overstreet Mall didn't really make sense (two Salsaritas in a two block radius!).  I like what they did with the dining area.... they really took some time out to think about the local art and even have a custom skyline bench that borders one of the walls.  I came on an off peak lunch hour, cause their lunch line is ridiculous (well any place Uptown has a mad lunch rush).  So I think the employees were \"recovering\" from the previous lunch rush.  Trash was still on the tables, but I did see someone cleaning up while I was dining in.  Sailed through the line pretty quickly so no complaints and my Mediterranean sandwich was pretty darn good...  should have added the chicken.",

Being a former Chicago resident, I am not new to Potbelly and this Charlotte location is exactly how I remembered it.  The service is great, food is amazing, and live music is a nice touch.    I recommend getting the hot peppers on pretty much anything you order as they are legit Chicago style hot peppers.  Also, make sure you check out the secret menu as it adds some nice combos not on the regular menu. Also, the Dream Bar might be the best desert ever created. Their cookies are insane too.   Their perks program is also great as they seem to have weekly free with purchase promotions.",

I thought it was good but not the best sandwich ever (that award still goes to Jersey Mikes and Harris Teeter for me).   I got a skinny turkey sandwich. My fiance got the Italian. We both liked them alright but nothing about them really stood out. The employees were friendly. All in all, it was cool. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back but if I were Uptown and wanted a quick lunch (and Pita Pit were closed), I would come here again.",

If you order one of their special sandwiches, you expect it to come as described with everything on it, but at Potbelly, they leave the sandwich totally plain unless you specify toppings. If you have a sandwich on your menu, just sell it that way instead of putting nothing on it. It doesn't make sense to have a high wall no one can see over and expect them to pick toppings.",
