I don't quite get the devotion some have with NY style pizza- again being a Deep South girl I don't like to fold my pizza as I would a piece of bread- but their pizza is very good especially considering the thinness and I guess we all love what we are accustomed to.  Their cheese tastes REALLY good on their slices and the slices are HUGE with plenty of pepperoni on them!  Me and the mister were happy to see them open up another location in the UC as it saves us gas in getting to them.  We probably eat here at least 3 times a month and the new location is AWESOME though they are about $.50 or more more expensive here than in Davis Lake on the prices.  The medium pizza is more than enough for two people and the mister usually gets the cheese steak or sometimes the lasagna or ziti.  The pasta isn't out of this world, but for the price it certainly is good.  I like their garlic bread that comes with the pasta items- about an 8 inch hoagie loaf split open and buttered and garliced up before entering the oven.  Their pizza by the slice lunch deals are pretty good and the managers are very friendly.  Give 'em a try cause you can't go wrong.",

The meatballs were TERRIBLE - I really believe they were store-bought, processed meatballs.  If they really were made in-house, then the cook needs to back off of the breadcrumbs, because these were bouncy, rubbery meatballs.  The sauce was OK, but I do question if made in house.  Alas, not very good - but perhaps OK for this region not known for Italian food.",

Their smallest (16\") is enough for three people. I sometimes go with a colleague and we can never finish the smallest pie just between the two of us, which isn't too bad either because the leftovers will freeze beautifully.   Their pizza by the slice is also very good but they reheat it in the oven and sometimes it is not awesome but just very good. You may keep that in mind and ask them not to reheat it for too long.   As for the lasagna, my advice (surprisingly) is not to get it, because it isn't worth it. It is also too large a meal since it comes with a salad and garlic knots.",

    "text": "One my favorite NY-style pizza joints in Charlotte.   There are many places around that claim to have \"authentic\" NY-style, but I tend to disagree with a good amount of them.   The 411 on NY-style... Pies are generally large in size, but moreso cardboard thin. Perfect proportions of Italian GRAVY (thicker sauce, still slightly marina based), cheese, and Italian spices. Pies have very crisp dough & crust, and not saturated by a lot of moisture, as you would find at your local Papa John's or Pizza Hut. Pies are generally cooked at very high temperatures, for a very short time- i.e. 800+ degrees for under 10mins.  That said, this restaurant makes their pies accordingly. Word of advice, if you have an appetite, try to avoid having eyes bigger than your stomach here. Their medium pie is a large at any other pizza joint, and their large is, accordingly, an extra-large. All kidding aside, the large will feed quite a few easily, with leftovers. In addition to their pie sizes, they mimic the above NY-style well. I don' know whether or not they incorporate dough conditioners or MSG's but their pizza is incredibly tasty!  Their overall menu is more of a combination between Italian and finger food. You won't find many lavish pasta entrees, but you can get yourself a philly cheesesteak and some jalopeno poppers.   Located in the Davis Lake Commons. See their menu online @ <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.menusearch.net%2Fmenus%2F2271take_out.pdf&s=83c77512a47bd311ce3cab3b88a77cc38d181e4acdeef6bc7b481149e1c1dd4b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">menusearch.net/menus/227...</a>.",

I ordered a medium pizza with half pepperoni and it was ready for pickup in 20 minutes. For a medium the pizza was gigantic! I can't imagine what the large is like. Let's start from the bottom up. The dough was thin and the crust was crispy, just like good pizza should be. The sauce was bright red and tasted fantastic. The cheese was just the right amount, not too much and not too little.  I will definitely be returning for more pizzas and recommend this place to anyone looking for a great pizza pie.",

    "text": "Stealth business. Run like it's in the witness protection program but has really good pizza  I found this place on Yelp and was intrigued by the idea of getting some real New York-style pizza during a trip to Charlotte.   When I dug a little deeper to try to find a website with a menu, or any other sign this business actually existed, I came up almost empty. At one point I thought \"I have it\" but then noticed the web site I found listed 4 locations -- in Fresno!  I finally just called the place using the number in Yelp and somewhat to my surprise, they actually existed. I ordered a \"small\" pizza and set out in my car to pick it up.   As previously described, the \"small\" pizza would feed a \"small\" mob. I mentioned to the manager that I had a hard time finding the place on the web, and he replied \"yeah - someday the owner might put up a web site...\"  He also told me that they had another location next to the WalMart on North Tryon Street, which was literally 6 blocks from where I started out.   In any case, the pizza was: huge, tasty and with a True New York style crust. Excellent! Worth the hassle, but it sure could have been easier.",

Unfortunately the staff and management seemed to have changed during the last couple months and this place is starting to fall off. The first I noticed along with the new faces behind the counter is the cleanliness of this place. It is a a lot  junkier and dirtier than it used to be. There is a lot of flour on the floor, empty boxes stacked up all over the place and just the overall feel seems greasy. The pizza is still pretty good but they might have changed the type of cheese they now use. It just doesn't taste as good as it once did.",

    "text": "Awesome hole in the wall find!  Everything we tried was awesome.   PIZZA is thin and crispy, but the dough has some chew after the initial crunch - exactly how I like it!  We tried cheese with banana  peppers and meatball/pepperoni/onions. When we return, we will probably stick with plain cheese. The only negative to our entire meal was that the onions were placed raw on top of the pepperoni/meatball slice. Those really should have been put on the slice prior to heating up in the oven.   EGGPLANT PARMIGIANA Hot Sub: The eggplant slices were a bit thick for my liking, but overall the sandwich was delicious. Great bread! The hot sub ordinarily comes with fried eggplant, cheese and marinara only. However, I ordered it with lettuce tomato and mayonnaise on top, and it was perfect!   CANNOLI: one of the best I've ever had. The cannoli shell is made in-house and it has a subtle cinnamon flavor that makes it unique. It's super crispy, and a perfect base for the not-overly-sweet cream filling.   SERVICE: the young girl working the register is a perfect representative for this business. She was helpful and patient when I asked questions about the menu. She provided plenty of information which helped me make my decisions. And she jokingly told me bye and that she'd see me tomorrow. Makes me want to go back tomorrow. :) The guy behind the counter slinging the dough seems legit. There were a steady stream of customers the entire hour we were there, but the guys in the back were friendly and unruffled.   EATING IN:  nothing fancy here, just 10 or so booths, fluorescent lighting and a soda machine.  This is a great place in the north Charlotte area. If you're around the mall, don't waste time at the food court; take a short drive to DaVinci's instead. You won't be disappointed.",

They have a couple \"combos\" such as 2 slices and a drink or 1 slice, salad, and a drink, or sub and drink. The combos are in the $7-10 range, so very reasonable for lunch OR dinner (you can get the combo all day long). I usually go for the slice and salad combo. The salads are pretty good, and they give you enough ranch for the ever important dipping of your crust at the end! I have also ordered whole pies for takeout and they are just as good when you take them home or eat in the restaurant.   It is a very casual, family friendly pizza shop with booths and tables. The staff is friendly and if you order anything in the restaurant will bring it out to you after you order at the counter. I have gotten delivery once or twice, and it usually arrives 45 mins to an hour after ordering (this was on a busier weekend night).   If you like a good New York style pizza - this is the place for you!",

The service is never great but it is usually adequate.The low rating is for the horrible and rude service that i received today. I ordered 2 slices of cheese pizza which they already have ready, they just warm it in an oven for 2 or 3 minutes. So, this is 11:15am and I'm the only customer  there. Almost 10 minutes go by and go up front to see what the hold up is. One girl looks in the oven goes and talks to another guy. He yells \"Nick, we need you up front\". Nick comes up cuts 2 slices and throws them in the oven. Now, not one word has been said to me by anyone at this point. So I asked if he was just now putting my order in, to which Nick chimed in with \"What about it, it will be ready soon\". I wish I would have asked for my money back. There are 3 other restaurants in that shopping center. I will not be back.",

    "text": "Davincis gets 5 stars because of the 4 things you want from a pizza place. Fast, authentic (NY, not italian) great customer service, and cheap. I'm mostly rating the by the slice pizza. They make a whole pizza and then warm them up by the slice. The slices are New York clones. They are about a foot and a half long, floppy, cheesy, and perfect for lunch. Its like New York but clean. The slices are out in about 5 minutes, piping hot on a full size pizza platter. A slice is about 2.50$ and some change after tax. Its a not-so-hidden gem in north charlotte. The only bad thing about Davinci's is that the parking lot is pretty bad. Its not tight, its just a big shared parking lot, some spots are parallel and some are normal. The way its set up can cause a little confusion, especially when one of the stores nearby I'd having a sale. But that should not stop you from visiting. They also sell whole pizzas which are not proportional to the 'by the slice' slices. They are still really big though and really good. They dont skimp on quality for quantity.",

The cheese and sauce make a great combo here, unlike some other places the sauce here tastes sweet which adds to the greatness of it. The pizza slices are huge and well worth the money. One improvement they can make is the crust, it is slightly chewy and sometimes the bottom can be burnt.

Why wouldn't you put a few spoonfuls on the pizza and then heat it up, Davinci's?!? SMH.  Moral of the story, get a slice, grab a calzone or a cookie and don't get cute.",

Spaghetti was terrible, meat sauce tasted old. Steak sub had something resembling steak??? only. I had asked for lettuce,.onions, peppers. My fault though cheese automatically came on steak and cheese sub but I guess I am wrong. The topper was the fries were thrown in bag in their little tray, not even wrapped. Guess it was way to much trouble? The only thing this food was fit for was the trash. Not even worth complaining. I dont want a do over. Sad, it was convenient and food used to be good.",

The calzones here really make me happy in my tummy. The sauce on the side is a perfect balance of sweet and tangy. And it's filled with tons of ricotta and mozzarella cheese.   They do deliver but only to a limited three miles. But call in and pick up your order, other wise you'll be sure to wait a bit.   A small here is like a large at papa johns. They have pasta which I have to try but I've seen dishes and they look amazing too.",

I have been all over the east coast and have had everything from Ny pizza in the Bronx, Greek pizza in Ct., Armenian pizza in Boston, Sicilian pizza in Florida, and everything in between, and one thing I can tell you is that this is NOT good pizza. It is not bad but it is surely not good, it is nothing special, basic pizza is ok when the ingredients are nice and fresh, our pizza had caned olives and mushrooms(or they had been out for two long), plain sauce, and grocery store prepperoni on a thin chewy crust. We just moved to the area and normally my wife makes pizza at home, but after reading the reviews and a really long day we decided to try something new, we will not be ordering from there again. There is nothing special there you would be better off moving on.",
