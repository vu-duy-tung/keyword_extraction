    "text": "Couldn't find the new Balantyne location on Yelp so here you go... Great menu for Sandwiches and Pastries. I stood at the counter for a few minutes while the counter person was talking to someone in the kitchen, through the pick up window. One person in our group had a Breakfast Sandwich....the bread was an average size with egg and cheddar cheese..it was on a tray/plate large enough to hold four more sandwiches.  Another person had Soup of the Day with a piece of Bread and Butter...her tray/ plate at least looked full..she had to put her spoon in the soup to get it hot enough to spread the butter, no knives? Myself and the other person had sandwiches, which again looked lost on a tray/plate large enough to hold a dinner plate, salad plate and a drink! I had the TAB...the Chutney was fresh and flavorful, the brie tasted like it was double cream but the amount of Turkey was lacking. No options for a side with the Sandwiches...no choice of Chips or Fruit or even a small cup of Pasta Salad? Most restaurants give you something with your sandwich, even Panera gives you options. I've never been thrilled about having ice for my drink dipped out of a cooler! When I asked for a cup of milk ($2.00!) for a cup of milk for my Granddaughter it took two employees to figure it out. What cup, what size and then they asked me it it was enough. It was poured out of a gallon purchased at a grocery store!   We bought some desserts before we left. Instead of the counter person getting everything I wanted out of the cases, boxing them up , and then ringing up my purchases....I had to walk back and forth between the register and the cases. Tell the person what I wanted so she could ring it up and then remind the other person what I wanted. Doesn't seem to be an efficient way to do business. If your employees haven't been properly trained, bring in good employees from your other locations until they are.",

    "text": "SO DISAPPOINTED TO WRITE THIS, but 2 out of 3 experiences being bad indicates a problem.  I love the sandwiches here. And the croissants.  And the coffee is not bad.  But when it's busy (or late in the day), you'd be better off avoiding this place and going to Einstein or Owen's Bagel for your sandwiches.  You'll pay less, wait less and still be super satisfied.    Because of a previous tasty experience with the Avocado Melt, I took some family visiting from out of town here on a Saturday morning.  I should've been wary of the long line and the lack of seating, but my taste buds were craving that avocado melt on a croissant.  When we attempted to move two open tables together, one guy told us it was ok (before we started moving them) and then another lady came by and scolded us for blocking the kitchen walkway (it wasn't blocking, but it was an impediment so I understood).  We moved them back but then had no where to sit.  Some chairs at the window bar opened up, and we sat there with our coffees waiting for all of our sandwiches.  The a/c was not cranked down far enough and we literally had sweat dripping down our faces.  We could not drink the coffee as that would've been unbearable in the heat.  We kept rotating seats so one of us could sit over the one functioning air conditioning vent to try to cool down a little.    After 15-20 minutes, a girl came and took our number off of the bar in front of us.  We were puzzled, but then went to find her and tell her that our food had not yet arrived so we were wondering why she removed the number.  \"Oh!\" she replied.  \"I thought it had already been delivered.\" -- there was food in front of us (the croissants we picked up while ordering) so we didn't get too worried at that point.  A few minutes later, the cashier who rang us up came over and said \"I thought you ordered to go.\" I'm not sure why she gave us a number if she thought we were ordering to go.    But ok.  No, we're eating in and we're still waiting for our sandwiches ($60+ worth, by the way).   She says oops, let me go change that in the system.  We waited another 20 minutes.  At this point, we've been waiting for 45 minutes, so we asked for the status.  A lady told us that they were still in the queue but should be out shortly.    Because we were sweating like pigs and basically dying in the overheated front window of this place, we were ACUTELY aware of the passing time as well as the turnover of other tables.  At some point in the middle of our wait, I took my toddler outside for a walk.  As we were coming back inside the shop, I held the door open for an adorable family with several cute blonde boys.  I watched them order, then ultimately receive and eat all of their breakfast sandwiches before I again asked the cashier for a status update on our order.  She appeared apologetic and said that it shouldn't have taken that long and went to the back to check.  She came back with the lady I assume was the manager who told me that my order was still in the queue and that there were others who ordered before me who had not received their food yet.    While I would appreciate that position if it were True, it was not.  Literally every single person still in the shop or sitting outside had arrived after us.  I can state that as a fact.  I nicely told her that we were unwilling to sweat it out any longer and asked her to cancel our order and provide a refund if the kitchen had not started the order yet.  She did so, but it took her several very long minutes to find our order in the system.  She kept scrolling and scrolling.  This told me that our order was placed LONG BEFORE she thought it was.   My guess is that the cashier placed us as a to-go order that got produced and either picked up by another customer or ditched because no one picked it up.  When she asked us if we were eating in, she might've put it in as a new order, so it was therefore 20-30 minutes further along in the queue than it should've been.    You can see from my reviews that I rarely give a 1 star and I reserve it for truly bad experiences.  I'm disappointed in Sunflour because I really want the service to be as good as the sandwiches.  But given that my first experience at the Elizabeth location was with all stale baked goods, and now my third experience at the East Blvd location was such a downer, I have to give up on this company.  I appreciate the refund, but I did not appreciate the manager's attitude toward me, as if I were completely rude for trying to cut in line by asking for my order over an hour after I placed it.  A little kindness on her part would've completely eliminated my irritation.    After waiting over an hour and leaving very hungry, we went down the street to Einstein and paid $18 for the same amount of sandwiches and received them within 3 minutes of ordering.",

Push your way through the sea of gnarly beards, the manbuns that need clipping, and the noserings and you'll come to the counter. The menu features a small selection of coffee, pastries, and lunch items. Starbucks yuppies may feel out of place here.  Order some coffee and a pastry and have seat. Yum, that pastry tastes good. The coffee? Tastes fresh, not bitter, and certainly not the garbage served at Starbucks. As you observe your receipt for the damage, you probably notice the fair prices (for a U.S. bakery). No $10 coffee, no $5 pastry...ahh, that was great.  I will be back, and I am sure you will too. Just bring a flyswatter for the hipsters next time.",

Somehow, they had 10 wedding cakes....yep you read that right. Four of the camera were dozens of custom cupcakes. And the remaining 6, were all different flavors. Each more delicious than the last.

They also adapt their menu seasonally so that they can use local produce. The original Elizabeth location has been in Charlotte since 2009 and the Dilworth location since 2016. They have a huge selection of sandwiches and confections. My favorite sandwich is their avocado melt with roasted tomato, spinach, basil and goat cheese. Their Key Lime pie is oh so smooth and the perfect amount of tart, with a nice buttery graham cracker crust. The filling is made with key lime juice sourced directly from Key West, so it is no wonder that with one spoonful I was instantly teleported back to my trips to the Keys, where the creamy consistency and natural lime flavor of their pies are unbeatable compared to those that you usually encounter outside the Keys that taste very manufactured/synthetic.",

    "text": "YUM! I made my first in-store visit to Sunflour this past weekend and really enjoyed it. Overall, I think they provide a wonderfully chill option to the plethora of overpriced brunch places in Charlotte.  I had their fig and brie panini, which I highly recommend. I also couldn't leave without trying one of their baked goods, and the raspberry chocolate cupcake I had was literally one of the best cupcakes I've ever tasted. The cake was thick and moist and the raspberry icing actually tasted like *gasp* raspberries instead of just loads of sugar.  Only complaint is there isn't much space or seating. It's quite popular and people were having to bunch/crowd/bump into each other when trying to order and getting a table is definitely not guaranteed. Wish there were less people camped out with laptops doing work like they were in Starbucks. Some of us want to enjoy good food at a lovely cafe.",

    "text": "I went to Sunflour last Saturday because I was in the Dilworth area and wanted to eat something healthy. My birthday was last weekend, so this was certainly a \"I'm treating myself\" kind of experience.   I walked in the front door after getting an awesome parking spot and was greeted by 4 of my friends! I had no idea they would be there, but I loved that I ran into them. Sunflour is so quaint and inviting. I could sit ther for hours and drink coffee or tea, ready, chat with friends, eat cupcakes. YUM.  I ordered the Avocado Melt which has avocado, goat cheese, roasted tomato, basil, spinach. You can choose your bread - I did the rosemary sourdough which had excellent flavor and complimented the sandwich well. My sandwich was ready pretty quickly and I also devoured it pretty quickly because it was so good. I did not order a cupcake this time, but my friend did. She got the chocolate cake with raspberry frosting and my mount was watering watching her eat it (umm, that sounds weird, but y'all know what I'm saying).   I will definitely go back to Sunflour again!",

They did not have onions or pickles so my sandwich was very plain. I also asked for mustard and it didn't have any in it. The sandwich was dry and boring. The cupcake was nothing special and was also dry. The place was cute inside and had available parking. The to go sandwich took more than 20 minutes. Was not impressed but would love to try something different as I know people who enjoy the placw",

    "text": "A friend and I stopped in their second day in business at this location. What a breath of fresh air. Friendly service, fresh and hot coffee, and a menu that gives you options without being overwhelming.   I ordered an egg n cheese on a croissant, plus added tomato for $0.50. It could have been the fact that I had finished up a long run, and was very hungry, but I think it was one of the tastiest egg sandwiches I've ever had. The croissant was perfectly flaky, the egg was seasoned just right, and the tomato tasted super fresh for the time of year.   My friend ordered the same but with ham; his sentiments echo mine. We shared a French press which wasn't the best French press I've ever had, but it did the trick (definitely think I'll try a more speciality-type drink next time).   I eyeballed the pastries but didn't try one. I hope to do that soon but as of right now, I can't comment on that aspect of the business.   Our order did take a long-ish time to come out but like I said, it was their second day in business; there's bound to be some hiccups to work out.   I'll definitely be back here again. I liked the 7th street location and I'm very glad to have this one now, which is a little closer to my house.",

    "text": "I'm going to be super clear here: I LOVE the croissants at Sunflour and would eat them every day if that was a reasonable thing to do. If you read nothing further, here's my breakdown: Really good pastries, terrible service, and when we found glass in our food (baked into a muffin) they ignored us and never followed up. That's GLASS SHARDS IN OUR FOOD, folks.  Food Review: 5. The croissants alone qualify it for a 5. I don't even care what their other food tastes like. Everything Else: 0. Literally ZERO. They would be better off having vending machine serving this stuff.  So the food is good. It's everything else that's wrong with this place. They are constantly understaffed and the customer flow seems designed to slow things down (those other reviews, offering to come back and give them another shot? They'll have the same experience next time as well. It's endemic). Their service is lackadaisical, takes FAR too long for the product being delivered, and in general seems more interested in being cool and hipster than actually turning their (really tasty) product. That line out the door? It could be easily solved by hiring an extra person behind the counter, reallocating staff during busy times, or simply adjusting the manner in which people pick up pre-prepared food and check out. If solid customer service was their goal, they could turn this thing around in less than a week.  Finally, there's the small matter of GLASS IN THE FOOD. This is inexcusable. We called the restaurant after finding a peanut sized chunk of glass in a \"Morning Glory\" muffin, and were told we would be contacted when a manager was free. Never heard from them. For background, if a restaurant breaks a glass in the kitchen, protocol is to throw out EVERYTHING in the area. It's just good business not to be sending folks to the hospital. We kept the muffin for a couple of weeks and finally threw it out when it became clear we had been forgotten.   Final aside: I have a friend who loves to hang out at Sunflour and work. He's not concerned about the long wait for food while he checks email, enjoys the coffee and agrees with me that the food is really good. He also thinks that since I found glass in my meal the odds of that happening again are very low. He's so practical. So there's that.",

Seating inside surrounded by windows which is always a plus on sunny days, outside seating available as well. The display case was well-stocked with baked goods. The restroom is out a door, into a larger space and to the rights, a little strange, but this place is much bigger than it appears.   THE FOOD: I'm crazy about macarons and they had 3 big ones to choose from. In the bottom of the case I noticed a 25% off box of 2 macarons. I felt so bad for those little guys I just had to get them, not without asking if they had fallen on the floor first though. Ordered a White Peach Blossom loose leaf tea and asked for it iced so they gave me a big cup of ice. It was refreshing in the sense of taste and that it was organic. It's nice to have options, oh and $2.00 isn't bad. My mother got a latte which was also delicious.  The macarons from the island of misfit sweets were a bit broken and cracked, but beauty is on the inside and let me tell you if you like chocolate, please get the Mocha macarons! Two oversized cookies with a deep, rich chocolate ganache filling piped inside and dusted with cocoa powder. The espresso notes are subtle, but enrich the chocolate to a point where it tastes like a gourmet truffle. One man's 25% off is another woman's treat.",

To my surprise, this place was packed with neighborhood peeps standing in line for their coffee and breakfast sandwiches/pastries.  I decided to join in on the fun.  The good thing about long lines is that it gives you plenty of time to figure out what you want to order.  I decided on a ham, egg and cheese on a croissant.  The sandwich was huge and yes, I ate the whole thing.  It was really good, but I am pretty sure they are using imitation eggs and I would have preferred real eggs.  I ordered a regular coffee, which was good and did the job.  I sipped on my beverage while I waited a whopping 15 minutes for my food.  They warned me when I got to the register, so it wasn't a shock when I decided to place my order.  Here's what I'm ordering next time.  For sure, I'm getting one of their pastries.  They looked amazing and there was this blueberry treat that someone was eating at the table next to me...I was so close to just tearing off a piece to try, but thanks self control.  They also serve FRENCH PRESS COFFEE!!!  Individual or large sizes.  I got my order to-go, but if I stay to eat next time, I'm trying it.  Also, in no way to I eat anything vegan, but they do have options for those who are looking for some vegan treats.  I'll certainly be back.  It's the perfect place to stroll out of bed and head down the street to a neighborhood joint where people won't judge you in your sweatpants.  Might be hard to get a table when it's packed, but wait a few min and someone will get up.  See you soon, Sunflower!",

I think many others tend to agree as Saturday mornings at the Dilworth Sunflower location are busy. The space is on the smaller side, so plan on feeling a bit crammed, and possibly waiting a bit for seating and/or your food. To-go orders are always an option. It's worked out fine each Saturday that I've gone and I've definitely left happy with a full tummy.   Though I haven't tried their pastries and desserts, they look amazing.

I threw it away and went to kenth cafe for a   A+ chia latta w/ caramel. Hot btw",

Got a cheddar biscuit warmed up and it was delicious but for simply warming up a biscuit the wait took a longgg time for a to go order. I followed another yelper's recommendation to just get the biscuit without any eggs/meats etc and that was the right decision it can stand alone it's so flavorful. The chocolate croissant was ok. The croissant itself was good but the chocolate inside was only partially melted and had awkward chunks in it... Too sweet for me.",

    "text": "2 words that will change your life....CHEDDAR BISCUIT....the biscuit is a 5 for sure. This is what you go to Sunflour for. I found their sandwiches to be quite mediocre (at least at the 7th street spot). But the cheddar biscuit is what lured me here in the first place and what keeps me coming back. They do have great house made vegan soups that change daily, but don't for a second fool yourself in to thinking that you are going to be able to eat a soup and an entire cheddar biscuit breakfast sandwich. Not gonna happen. Trust. I've tried.   So let me tell you a little bit about what you are getting in to. A biscuit with bits of cheddar baked in, crispy and brown on the outside and soft and airy on the inside. Get it with egg, cheese (yes more.) bacon, roasted tomato, some spinach, and avocado, or any combination of those things. I do wish they did a little something better with the egg though. Its more like a slab of egg custard than substantial egg most of the time. Kind of a texture bummer. But the whole sandwich is great regardless.   Be forewarned though. These puppies sell out. ESPECIALLY on weekends. The 7th street location is almost always out by noon any day of the week I've called. Not sure why they don't realize that and just make more daily. Anyways, East Blvd has a heftier supply of them. Even though the 7th street location is MUCH closer to my house, I found myself going to the East Blvd location instead for this reason. The staff is also extremely friendly at this one. The atmosphere is a bit better on 7th though. Either location, expect to find kids....lots of kids.",

I got there around 9:30am and there seems to be a good amount of people coming and going. The first time we drove right by it so be careful since the sign wasn't that big to see.   The girls working there were a bit standoffish. Don't know if it was because it was still early and there was a constant stream of customers but they weren't that friendly and when I asked for recommendations they didn't really have much to give.       I got the chocolate croissant and a dirty chai latte. It was ok. The dirty chai latte wasn't my favorite and the chocolate croissant had very little chocolate in it. Their sandwiches looks promising so I'll probably come back and give it another try one day.",

    "text": "Sunflour is long on charm and pretty short on efficiency. This place is not a good choice if you're a take your-coffee-and-pastry-and-go person. If you are ordering any thing other than a hot, black coffee to-go, you will have to wait. and wait.  This location is centrally located on east blvd and feels like you're walking into a home converted into a coffee shop. It's pretty tight on space but there are spacious counter-top window seating as well as regular tables.   The pastry window is the True star and shines beautifully in displaying all of the homemade treats. The menu is written chalkboard style and covers the rest of the beverage and food options. When I walked in on a warm, Saturday morning, it was super hot and stifling in the store. There was a little bit of line but it moved pretty well.   I ordered an iced dirty chai latte and chocolate croissant. Sunflour is pretty well-known for their croissants and there is good reason. They are huge and flaky. Perfect for sharing or not all :) I had to wait a good 5-10 minutes for my iced dirty chai latte which I found ridiculous but then soon forgave them when I tasted it. Delicious. For both of those items, my total was $8.88. Not cheap but worth it.   While I was waiting for my drink, I noticed other people's food. I found that the egg sandwiches are made using some sort of square-ish egg patty. Personally, I would stick to only ordering pastries and not egg-based sandwiches from Sunflour. The sandwiches look pretty but I like a real egg on a breakfast sandwich.  Sunflour is a nice spot to chill on a leisurely weekend day (or weekday, if your schedule allows!) and sip and eat.",

    "text": "I'm really glad this place is on East Blvd.  There seems to be a shortage of breakfast places/options in the Dilworth/Southend area that results in hour long waits for weekend brunch/breakfast outings.  This place is double duty since it's a bakery, but they offer savory or sweet in terms of breakfast.  Now it's not an \"all out\" breakfast, but I believe their breakfast sandwiches are made on site with carefully chosen, fresh ingredients that support local produce vendors and farms.  They offer organic coffee and teas - cakes, cupcakes, sheet cakes, and various desserts and treats.  I didn't try their sandwiches, but they looked pretty awesome.  Came here after playing tennis on a Sunday morning, the crowd wasn't too bad and there was a line (ordering at the counter), but the employees were friendly and made sure to warn us how long the wait would be after ordering (just 10min).  We were able to sit outside (along with some furry friends that accompanied their owners to breakfast/coffee that day).  Inside there was a handful of tables and also bar seating along the window so you can watch cars and pedestrian traffic traverse East Blvd on a nice Sunday morning (or whenever you decide to visit).  Breakfast Sandwich #4:  Egg, Bacon & Cheddar on a Cheddar biscuit was my order, and I quickly gobbled it up.  I did have to take a breather since the biscuit (and I saw their croissants) are ginormous... so pace yourself.  Even spoiled myself and tried one of their oreo cookies... I have a weakness for oreos to begin with, but this was like one giant oreo!  Will definitely be back to try their other offerings or even just get a beverage and hang out with a book.  I can walk here which is a big plus for me, but it appears there is plenty of street parking along the side-streets in Dilworth.",

Ordered 2 of the same - a simple BLT, one with mayo, one without mayo, and both with added avocado. Upon arriving back to work and eagerly opening my sandwich, I was unimpressed with how it looked - sloppily put together and tasted fair.  Neither sandwich had mayo and neither sandwich had the avocado added (as shown on my receipt and charged and additional $1.50 PER SANDWICH). I left a generous 18% tip (more than the $3 for the avocado).  I've been trying to call to let them know, and nobody answers the phone. Needless to say, I will not be patronizing this establishment again.",

    "text": "I had been eager to try Sunflour #2 since it opened last year.  Sadly, I never found the right time until last week.  I had high expectations, as it's already hard to be competitive in Dilworth, and the original location has always been a win for me.  Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed.  The location offers some parking challenges, and is a bit smaller than the already cramped original.  The food offerings seemed about the same, and the quality was on point, but the service was lacking, and the overall cleanliness was poor.  There was no enthusiasm amongst the staff and I felt like more of a hinderance than a customer.  I had to ask for the only vacant table to be cleaned and I got a look like I had just descended from a spaceship.  Once the table was finally wiped down, the crumbs just rolled onto the seat cushions and some sort of slime awaited me on the floor that I proceeded to slip on.   I enjoyed my lunch, and the bright light offered from the large windows.  I also found the WiFi to be reliable as I sat there catching up on some work.  I think they would be better suited to remove a table or two to open up the room, as the tables currently feel on top of one another.  The trash and tray return station is on one side of the restaurant, and wasn't even visible from where I sat.  I think adding another on the opposite side would help.  Overall, the experience would've been better for me had it been cleaner and had the staff been a bit more warm.  It wasn't horrible, but it's nothing like the original.  I'll give them a second try at some point, but I'm in no hurry.  I can only hope my experience was based off of the lunch rush.",

Both locations in Charlotte, even at different times of day have the same slower-than-reasonable service. Usually 30 minutes to walk in, wait in line, and order a simple ham, egg and cheese. I return because their food is good, but management looking at wait times would be beneficial to customer retention.",

We also shared a bowl of their red pepper soup, which was a great accompaniment to the sandwiches. I had a chai tea latte as well, which really hit the spot!   The new space is walkable to many local businesses, so I believe they will get more busy as people realize they are now here. I can't wait to go for breakfast or for a cupcake snack. Everything in their baked goods case looked excellent! I will be back very soon, and I will likely be a repeat customer.",

I've been here twice now, and the location is wonderful, the ambiance is exactly what I think of for a perfect brunch/breakfast, and they have an outdoor patio that's inviting to dogs and families that faces East Blvd. I just don't think I enjoy the food as much as my company does.   So far I've stuck with their paninis, which have been alright. Last time I was there I got the Grilled Cheese, and it was just a little bit underwhelming? I don't know. I want to love this place, because I love everything else about it. I just can't justify 4 or 5 stars for somewhere I'm 'meh' about their food.   If anybody has any suggestions of what I should try next time to redeem my experience, I'm totally open to trying out new stuff! Let me know, I want to love Sunflour!",

This time I ordered the Pimento Cheese & Tomato Grilled Panini (White and yellow cheddar with roasted red  peppers topped with tomato) on sourdough (you can pick your own bread!). It was perfect. The boyfriend similarly ordered the grilled cheese which was basically a simplified version of mine (Cheddar, provolone and tomato). I tried his too and it was also really good! My friends ordered the Fig & Brie Panini and the Avocado Melt and both looked amazing. I've had the Avocado Melt before and enjoyed it very much. Fig & Brie is next on the list!  The pastries are also excellent! Get a cheddar biscuit as a side. You won't regret it.   The atmosphere here is also very chill. Order at the counter and then find open seating. There are some outdoor tables available and then the cafe has bar seats along their windows as well as tables for parties of various sizes. That being said, it's a small place, so don't come with more than like 6 people and expect to find a place to sit.  Saturdays are less busy than Sundays.",

So if you're afraid of dogs like I am, walking in can be tricky  Parking in the front can be dicey; parallel parking on busy East Blvd can take skill.

I also got a large iced coffee which was really good. I'm typically super picky with iced coffee but this one was dark and smooth. The cheddar biscuit was pretty awesome. It's large and cheesy and goes well with the rest of the sandwich. The cinnamon bun was a real treat. The frosting isn't too sweet and almost has a cream cheese flavor to it? Maybe?

Only complaint is the egg component is the only draw back - tasteless. Make sure you get tomato ham, bacon, cheese or avocado to really keep your sandwich experience safe.

    "text": "Super cute place. The atmosphere is quaint, good place to grab a coffee of a sandwich when meeting friends for a quick lunch. Only downside- it's popular and not that big inside so seating can get cramped.  The toasted sandwiches are delicious- really like the Avocado melt (usually get bacon on it) and the southern BLT. And you cannot go wrong with any of the baked good :)  I am a HUGE fan of the cupcakes, not overly huge, so I don't feel like I'm getting diabetes when I eat one, but it still sates my sweet tooth.   Perfect little neighborhood coffee shop.",

    "text": "This is my favorite place in Charlotte, hands down. They have amazing coffee, pastries and breakfast sandwiches. You must get the cinnamon roll (it is huge so split it with someone) but is amazing. Ask for it warmed up and it will come out to you at the perfect temp. The icing has an amazing cream cheese flavor and you will want to lick the plate.  After you devour the cinnamon roll, opt for some protein and get a breakfast sandwich. You are missing out if you do not get it on the cheddar biscuit - it is life changing. I used to get it on multigrain bread and it is good, but the cheddar biscuit is on another level. It has the perfect amount of crispy outside and soft inside. I highly recommend the cheddar biscuit with egg, cheddar, bacon and add avocado (it is worth it).  Coffee is also great, I love their cold brew! Definitely try Sunflower, you will not be disappointed!",

Was disappointed that they had already run out of oat milk for my coffee by 9am, but their homemade rosemary ciabatta breakfast sandwiches made up for it. If you're vegan this place is a must as it seems that most of their pastries are vegan friendly. Definitely a good place to unwind during vacation while enjoying a tasty treat.",

Their cupcakes generally tasted pretty good, but their frosting was a bit too sweet and there was too much of it. Also, I would suggest only buying cupcakes you plan to consume that day, since on day 2, they were rock hard.",

Close to rail trail, Atherton Mill, Uptown, and lovely tree-lined streets to get a power walk in before devouring something luscious here. Atmosphere is family-friendly with indoor and outdoor seating.   We had the whole wheat muffin, a vegan masterpiece with berries (oh...I wanted one to go, but resisted) and a turkey egg sandwich (done in a panini press-love!) on rosemary sourdough. Bottled locally brewed Kombucha is available, and I can attest to the goodness of the cold brew.   I'd like to work my way through this menu on a weekly basis, if my diet can handle it. Time for another power walk!",

This did not disappoint - so many times i have purchased a croissant and it had no flavor - this one was perfect.    *Tiramisu was very good, nice flavor, good consistency - i'm. it a big fan of having chocolate chips in my tiramisu but i think that is a personal preference.     my daughter had the bread pudding; it was well - dry and not a lot of flavor - i came back into order my daughter the peach puff instead which was very light, not my favorite but my daughter enjoyed it.  When we did not ask for a box to take it home they offered the peach puff in the house! They handled this perfectly - with that type of service i bought another sugar cookie and they will get my next catering job from my company.",

The pie was fine (not as good as my homemade key lime pie). I thought it was a little on the sweet side but the Graham cracker crust was very nice.   I'll probably be back to try some pastries or a breakfast sandwich on a cheddar biscuit.   Note: there is a decent sized parking lot behind the business.",

With these items on their menu they can do no wrong.  Or so I thought....I went in yesterday because it was a meeting point for my volunteer work. I ordered a lemon bar and for the first time I was unimpressed  couldn't put my finger on exactly what element let me down but it wasn't a smooth lemon filling with a flaky crust. It literally was a hard bar! I even tried to let it sit out for a little but then the toppings melted! *sighs* I'll be back for my favs but not for this lemon bar....",

I just had to seek out that delicious looking cinnamon roll I've been seeing in the pictures.  I arrived at the charming little bakery and ordered the cinnamon roll and unfortunately they just sold the last one on the previous order. Better judgement prevailed and I didn't snatch it from the other customer and bolt.   I ended up ordering the Morning Glory muffin which I have to say is one of the best muffins I've ever had. Dense with slight outer crunch. This muffin had all the things I like carrots, coconut, pineapple and raisins.   I also received a free cookie from the lady at the counter. She must've seen how distraught I was from not getting the cinnamon roll. It was a nice gesture because that chocolate chip cookie was great as well.  If I'm ever back in town I'll definitely go back to Sunflower.",

Perfect suggestion! It is a large serving of Greek yogurt with strawberries and blueberries, some chia seeds and coconut mixed in, and granola on top. I got honey in the side and added a bit of it for a little extra sweetness. It was a delicious pre-meeting boost for breakfast! Can't wait to stop back in on upcoming business trips to explore more of their menu!",

The outdoor area needs a good cleaning. Our outdoor table was dirty and sticky, and at 9 am on a Sunday morning there was a good bit of trash scattered about on the ground. Our food took about 20 minutes to come out, and when it did my boyfriend's order was wrong. Rather than taking his meal back to the kitchen to add the cheese and avocado he'd requested and been charged extra for, they said they'd just bring those 2 items out on the side. This seemed odd but we said ok. It took another 7 minutes for the cheese and avocado to come out. By this point I was well into my breakfast and his breakfast was now cold, which was disappointing. We also overheard the table behind us, and their order was incorrect as well.  Hopefully we just caught them on an off day. The food was good, but the service and overall cleanliness of the restaurant was not up to par during our visit.",

The tart was bland on many accounts, the crust, the filling...I could barely taste the raspberry.   The bread pudding was unfortunately too dense and cold. I could appreciate room temperature but it was cold, cold. The denseness made it hard for me to pass the fork through the pudding. No bread pudding I've ever has been so hard to pass a fork through or served cold not warmed.   I applaud the cute workspace and sitting area. They have a good variety, but I'm afraid to try more at the expense of it not being good.",

    "text": "We were introduced to this charming, bustling cafe while visiting friends in Charlotte.   The breakfast sandwiches are perfection. Each starts with fluffy eggs, cooked in a square mold so there are no under/over done areas - just a perfect even egg. Additional toppings include cheese, avocado, and a several meats. You can choose from a variety of tasty breads, but obviously the cheddar biscuit is the best choice - flaky, cheesy, buttery, and substantial enough to support all the toppings you could want.  We also tried the pumpkin apple muffin, which is like eating Autumn (a good thing). The coffee is strong and full-bodied, and with a splash of almond milk completes any breakfast.  My only regret is that there isn't a Sunflour closer to me.",

    "text": "As a baker, I can safely say that Sunflour Baking Co blew me away while I was on my usual vacation bakery tour. I visited maybe 8 bakeries in 3 days across Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham and Asheville and this one was by far the best!   Their muffins were at that perfect time of day where they were still crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. They are dense too which is a must for me. If I wanted an airy muffin I'd go to publix. The Matcha scone had a beautiful texture BUT as a matcha fanatic, I could not taste it, not even a little bit, so it was a good buttermilk scone. I could tell from the color that it was not going to have the correct flavor. If you are going to do matcha, DO matcha, don't be afraid your clients won't like this specialty flavor.   Oh and their sandwiches were awesome! The bread was fantastic and their sandwich selection is great!  The location was easy to get to, there was plenty of parking and their coffee was great too. My only regret was not buying evern more things to try!",

Another customer seemed to show concerned which in turned lightened the expressions on the cashiers faces. The level of customer service was appalling.

And now they have a shop literally a scone's through from my house? Danger.  In the past I've been drawn to their muffins and sticky buns, which are fantastic. Ditto for the cupcakes. The caramel cake was so good... The slice was so big I could hardly finish it, and I don't say that often. (I haven't been able to try the famous cheese biscuits because they are always sold out by the time get there.) I will say, the coffee is not to my liking because it's dark roast, but I won't hold that against them.  But all of that goes out the window when you try a croissant. Oh, the croissants. They are flaky, buttery perfection. And they are huge. So y'all can keep buying the cheddar biscuits and leave the croissants for me.",

    "text": "Things I would order again -  * Croissant - Expensive at $3.75 apiece compared to $1.99-$2.50 from the local competitors, but they are larger in size than the competition in the area and MUCH better tasting.  Sunflour has the best croissants in Charlotte as compared to Amelie's, Earl's Grocery, Renaissance Pastisserie, etc. * Blueberry Croissant Square * Nutella Pop Tart * Blueberry Muffin * Cheese biscuits alone and not as a sandwich  Things I would not order again -  * Cappuccino - Go to Not Just Coffee inside the Atherton Mill around the corner and down the street instead.  Sunflour's capuccino is inconsistent. * Mixed Berry Scone - Not enough berries * Cheese biscuits as part of a breakfast sandwich.  Would use a sourdough or bagel for these sandwiches instead. * Cupcakes, but maybe because I got one on a Sunday it tasted a day or two old.  Yes, when I buy cupcakes I expect fresh baked.  If I wanted day or two old, I would bake them myself on the weekend and eat during the week.  Things I don't like about this place -  * Unless you get there first thing in the morning, the dining room is gross with crumbs all over the tables and chairs.  Even the outside tables are covered in other peoples food.  They either need to provide customers with wipes so we can wipe our own tables before sitting down or they need to get their employees out from behind the counter and at the very least clean the tables. * Not a fan of being asked to add a tip every time I order.  Yes, the food gets delivered to my table, but I go and get my water, I bus my own table, there is no one coming up to us and asking if we want anything else, and because the tables are not wiped down I bring my own wipes in my purse or backpack.  I give tips to True waiters and waitresses. * Additional note that the above two issues can be said for many restaurants, but I expect the places I frequent to be better than every other place I could do business with.  I mean why doesn't Sunflour make the same crappy croissants that everyone else makes?  Because they choose not to.  I'd like them to care for cleanliness in the dining room and outdoor spaces they use just as much as they care about the product they make.",

    "text": "My husband and I LOVE this place. We have been going to Sunflour since it first opened and our daughter worked there several years ago. The ingredients are top notch and they serve delicious sandwiches, pastries and coffee drinks and more. We love their special twist on a BLT, which is especially good on their homemade butter rolls. The lattes have been consistently perfect; the blondie cupcakes taste like the best pound cake ever, and are topped off with wonderfully creamy cream cheese frosting.  We love this East Blvd. location too...",

    "text": "I was disappointed. I am not going to lie. I do live in Plaza Midwood and have been going to that location for awhile. However, my work is in Dilworth. Doing nothing but raves, I did get some of my staff members together and we went to Sunflour to get something sweet. I am always one to talk this place up.   The environment in Dilworth is not as warm as it is in PM. I did notice  an older woman with a bun running around to different tables, working hard, but her face said other, She almost seemed bothered that there was \"business\".   I will say that yes, I did get confused about the buy 1 get 1 Magic bar.   The problem is - those were the day old ones, in comparison to the fresh ones. I did change my mind, and opted for the fresh one.   When the cashier rang me up, the lady, almost slid the prepackaged \"Magic Bar\" my way. The cashier said, \"no, she wanted one out of the case\". The lady w/ the bun said, \"you didnt get her order right?\" the cashier said,\"no, she changed her mind\" and the lady repeated it \"OH she changed HER mind\". I did. I changed my mind. I am very sorry that you had to open the case and put a fresh one in wrapping. I am sorry that changed my mind. I do not know what to say, and it was so uncomfortable that even the cashier gave me a look.   My co worker was snarled at for adding in a \"flavor\" shot to her coffee, after she was rung up.  We will pay for whatever difference. Geez, we are very sorry.   I will stick to Plaza Midwood location only. Hopefully, it will continue to stay sweet and lovely. Or, maybe, I should just make my own at home.",

    "text": "I have been looking at this place on Yelp for a few weeks now and kept telling myself that I was going to make it in. I love the location its only a few blocks from my house and easily accessible on east blvd and has a private parking lot on the side and in the back.  When I walked in the smell immediately won my heart, fresh baked bread, pastries and coffee brewing I was in heaven. They had a larger menu than I expected I knew going in they had breakfast and pastries but lunch sandwiches too? I had a vanilla latte and a egg provolone roasted tomato and spinach breakfast sandwich on rosemary olive oil bread for breakfast and it was probably the most delicious breakfast sandwich I have ever had....seriously I had to pull over on my way to work to eat it I was not able to make it all the way there it was to good to wait.   I do have to say its a little pricey I think when I went for just coffee and the sandwich I spent about 12 bucks which is more than some of the pricier places like starbucks, but given the fresh ingredients and just general deliciousness I'm sure ill be back with no complaints.  Also they have some pretty fantastic looking coconut macaroons that have been on my mind since my first visit. I am sure ill be a regular there.",

Wife had the Avocado Melt with rosemary bread, and described it as delicious and fresh, which she will order again.  We split a blueberry muffin, and it was the best I've ever had, complete with solid blueberries inside.  The best part is it's in walking distance from home.
