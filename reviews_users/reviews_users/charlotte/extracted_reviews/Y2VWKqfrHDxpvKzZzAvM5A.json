    "text": "The food is food, the staff was friendly polite, and so far I haven't seen evidence of food poisoning which is why they got the second star.  Beyond that, I wouldn't recommend this place.  Order the \"burnt ends\" and what we got was a piece of brisket that they cut up into tiny squares. And none of it was burnt (got 2 pieces where I could taste one corner that was smoked).  I ordered the lunch double cheese burger and fries. What I got was 7 fries and a double Bubba burger. I think they just go to Costco to pick up a bag of frozen burgers. And why they couldn't give a decent portion of fries is bewildering.  My friend got the double meat bbq plate and said the beans tasted like cheap canned beans with relish in it. And the cornbread was so dry it fell apart.  Basically, if you like good service and bad food, this is the place for you. If crappy food doesn't interest you, go just about anywhere else.",

Usually a grilled chicken breast or steamed broccoli or some other dish is available. Well not so much here. I spoke to the waitress who suggested the grilled chicken breast after telling me everything on their menu has s ton of salt in it. I wanted to order the grilled chicken breast with steamed broccoli but was told the broccoli was already seasoned in the bag (guess it was too hard for the cooks in the back to open a new bag of plain broccoli). I ordered a side salad and a grilled chicken breast. She came back out after a few minutes and let me know the chicken was also marinated and heavily salted. I ended up with a side salad (no egg, no bacon, no cheese, no crouton - yeah, lettuce, tomato, cucumber which where spoiled btw) and a side ramekin of vinegar - yumm...  Five bites later I was done with my \"dinner\". Got the bill and was in for my second disappointment. Was charged $4.99 for literally 1 cup of iceberg lettuce, four rings of rotten cucumber and 1oz of diced tomatoes. Shame on you!!!  Strike another's establishment off my list to eat...",

My wife and I went to their new location tonight and left very disappointed.  Our food  came out 20 minutes after our friends.  The waiter offered me some complimentary muffins while we waited which we refused.  We came to eat BBQ with our friends.  Finally, they delivered some beef scraps on a bun.  ( I wish I would have taken a pic). I complained to our waiter we were expecting sliced brisket which he said that is what they normally serve.  He had no idea why our's looked so bad.  He didn't offer to have the sandwiches remade and we were tired of waiting.    I strongly encourage the new franchise owner to get their act together.  I would have happily paid $10.95 for a very good sliced brisket sandwich,  not what we received.",

The food was excellent and we ordered a beer apiece at the bar. I ordered 1 round of shots for me and my buddies. Since we already had a beer, the bartender said that we had to push our beers away before we could have the shots. I thought that was weird but being house rules, we abided. After about 15 minutes we were ready for our second beer and were told that their house rules would not allow us to have any other drinks until an hour had passed. If we had known that when we sat at their sissy ass bar, then we probably wouldn't be upset but they make the rules when the game is in play and we were not driving anyway we had walked from our room 200 feet away. They lost our business from now on when we're in the area. So beware before you think you're going to sit at the bar and have fun with your buddies. You definitely won't do at sissy Dave's!",

It was pretty good. I had bbq pork nachos. I advise everyone who goes there, not to get those. The cheese was cold shredded cheese, not melted at all. I asked my waitress if that's how its suppose to come, and she said yes.  They should definitely let people know when ordering them. I've never had nachos with cheese not melted on them. Such a weird way to ruin nachos. There are more things on the menu that look like they would be a better choice.  I really wish I remembered the name of our waitress. She was very friendly and the place had a nice upbeat environment.  We will return, but definitely not for bbq nachos",

The interior of this location was certainly different than other Famous Dave's I've visited, more of a modern trendy vibe than the country saloon style I expected. We were seated right away and had our drink order taken by our server Val. Super polite and friendly, answered all our menu questions and kept our drinks (like the wonderful sweet tea) full the entire visit. My order consisted of the seasoned chicken tenders, Georgia chopped pork and firecracker green beans with a cornbread muffin. The chicken was nice and juicy, but the dry seasoning/rub is what really sets them apart from your average chicken finger. I haven't been to a Famous Dave's in years, but they were just as good as I remember. Pork, also juicy, cooked well, but not my favorite sauce I've ever had. Green beans were yummy, but didn't really get why they were supposed to be \"firecracker green\" beans, not that spicy. Lastly the cornbread. OH THE CORNBREAD. Easily the best cornbread I have ever had, anywhere. Buttery, moist, just a little sweet. Amazing. It's worth a visit for the cornbread alone but I don't think you'll be disappointed by anything you order.",

    "text": "This is the first restaurant I've given 5 stars to. I'm from up north and we had a few of these guys around where I lived and was bummed when I moved to the Carolinas and there were none. The Carolinas have a few good BBQ places, but they aren't FD. I was ECSTATIC to learn there was finally a FD by Carowinds.   I feel like they've made some updates since the last time I visited. First they have some vegetarian-friendly items (which is something they lacked before which is why I was only able to go once in the past five years - my wife is vegetarian). Second, the staff is super friendly. The manager (don't know his name. He's a bearded dude) is the right guy who clearly sets the tone for this location. They've built a great team. Everyone pitches in to help so it's super efficient.   Ok onto the food - that's why you're here. I used to only get the wings (best wings in my opinion - very little fat. Great sauce, though they've since added more so it complicates things a bit, but they do have great BBQ sauces now and you can order the wings naked) and the hot link sausage. I've only recently tried the brisket and OH MY GOSH. It was so flipping good. The first time I went it was moist and fell apart. Every piece had so much flavor I almost cried. The second time I went it was a bit dry but still good.   The cons - it's pretty pricey so I only go at lunch. Their lunch specials are a really great value. The other con is that every side is very blah - the mashed potatoes didn't have any flavor, the jalapeno Mac n cheese is ruined by the presence of jalapenos - just make some great unhealthy Mac n cheese (like baked m&c with breading) and we'll be good. My wife said the corn on the cob is too soft/spongy.  So despite the lackluster sides and high-ish prices (dinner), it still gets 5 stars as the only place I'll go to for BBQ from now on. Oh yeah, their bread pudding...it's slap yo mama good.",

They keep one sauce in the back if you are curious to try but beware-- it is HOT! My mouth was burning for several minutes after trying it. On to the food, I had the pulled pork and my sister and brother in law had brisket. All of it was delicious! My only gripe with the place were their sides. I had collard greens and they were very unspectacular and my fries tasted old. The meat alone was good enough to give them a 4 I only wish the sides were better. I did try the mac and cheese which was very good so maybe I just picked wrong. Overall, this place is fairly priced and you get more than enough bang for your buck. I recommend after a long day of riding coasters at Carowinds and make sure to wash all that BBQ down with a cold beer  Salud!",

The place smelled great an they have a pig in a costume of which I loved the pig. For me choices were limited if you like spicy everything pretty much had some kind of heat to it I was bummed.  Their mac n cheese had jalapenos in it that doesn't belong .  I wanted the cat fish fingers but the cornmeal it was rolled in was hot :(   I finally got the pulled pork sandwich I added slaw because if your from the south cole slaw comes on a BBQ sandwich SMH. However the slaw was not home made, Fries were my side well they were not crispy just barely warm.  If your wanting some BBQ this isnt BBQ to me but stop in an try it.  I know its a chain I assume they are not from the south, but I tried it:)",

The mac and cheese was disappointing even before I bit into a large piece of plastic wrap. That definitely put me off the rest of the meal.  There are too many fabulous BBQ options within a couple miles to eat a meal that's mediocre.",

It didn't taste like salad dressing at all. Just really sweet bbq sauce all over my salad. I asked our server for some ranch dressing. He stared at me, stared at my salad and gave me a really quizzical look like shaming me for asking for more dressing. He then said \"well I can get you some but it's an additional .29 charge\". My husband assured him we could handle the surcharge and off he went. Took him forever to come back with it, but he did oblige. I mean really??  I'm paying $12 for a salad with barely any meat to begin with and he's going to charge me for salad dressing that should have been on the salad to begin with?  Is this Zaxby's charging me for an extra Zax sauce ;). I mean it just seemed ridiculous to even suggest I pay that but whatever. We certainly had a good laugh as we left.   Overall, service was slower this visit and the meat portions seemed less generous, but the visit was fine (excepting the saucy salad and saucy waiter!).",

The sauce and food is just like I remembered back home.  The decor is homey and open.  I did hear uncensored music playing.  My only complaint is that the soup was a bit on the salty side.  It was almost inedible, but I was able to wash it down with a lot of water.  I don't like the new fries.  They are not seasoned enough.  The chicken tenders are flavored well with Dave's seasoning.  The catfish fingers are moist on the inside and have a delicate flavor.  The tartar like sauce offers a nice spice to the fish.  The cornbread muffins are amazing.  In fact, they are cat-worthy.  My cat is a jerk because she decided to eat it when I left it on the kitchen counter overnight.  I heard a microwave in use during my visit, can you guys at least hide it from public view?",

And let me say I'm glad we listened and that he likes to try new restaurants even though he's still a picky eater. There was so much to choose from so I settled on the Sampler which gave you catfish fingers, chicken tenders, string onion rings, bbq tips and four different sauces to dip. I feel like I'm leaving out something but anywho it ALL was delicious. Especially the tips and catfish fingers(never heard of that before) but I love catfish so it was a Win Win. My server Sky was very nice, informative and helpful...all with a smile. Different staff members as well as the manager came over to our table multiple times to make sure we were good and enjoyed the food. The ambience is cool, they also have a full bar and televisions. I also had Dave's Rum Punch which was recommended by Sky(she never tried it) and it was amazing and came with a grilled pineapple on a stick. My family and I will be back for one of our weekly takeouts. And definitely will be telling others about this spot tucked away in SC",

We started our meal off with an order of the burnt ends. These were a plate of deliciousness. They were tender pieces of the beef brisket seared in one of their famous sweet & Zesty sauce and came with a few fried onions. Some in our group order the feast for 2. What a dish. 1/2 slab of their ribs, half chicken, brisket or pork. They ordered the pork. It was so much food. All was good. If you have a favorite flavor of sauce for BBQ then this is your place. There were lots of sauce options from the Rich & Sassy to the Devil's spit hot sauce. The one down side was what they called the Eastern style BBQ sauce. I was looking forward to having this option and was expecting a good vinegar based BBQ sauce. What I was delivered was more of a sweet vinegar sauce that had way too much tomato sauce mixed in with the vinegar. To me this is not the Eastern style. I was a little disappointed. For the balance of the meals ordered, a brisket, wings and salmon dish was ordered. All tasted great and would order them again. The side dishes we ordered were so delicious. The collard greens and garlic mashed potatoes were some of the best ever. There was a wide selection of side options that included steamed broccoli, sweet corn, Wilbur beans (loaded baked beans with smoked pork, brisket hot link sausage jalapenos with the Rich and Sassy sauce), creamy coleslaw, mac and cheese grilled pineapple,  sweet mashed potatoes, potato salad and loaded baked potatoes.  Our service was great. The food was delivered in a timely manner and was a good warm/hot temperature. We would go back.",

We even had enough to bring home with us (it's a shame I didn't get a picture of it but be ready because it's a lot of food) The brisket was out of this world.

Chili meat was very tender and had the right amount of spicy heat. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was excellent. They offer potato chips with a sampling of various bbq sauces. The Devil's Spit is fantastic. Will definitely return.....Soon!",

We ordered the sampler platter and bbq nachos with NO BEANS to share between my boyfriend and I.  There was MORE than enough food. On the sampler platter we wanted bone in wings but got boneless. Had to call the store numerous times to get through but they called me back and we went back to the restaurant to trade for the bone in. We finally got home and once we started eating we noticed that our nachos were LOADED with beans .",

He literally doesn't listen and walks away from you as you are speaking to him. He did this the entire visit.  The food has something lost in translation between its roots and here in the south. It's just ok, not great as we're accustomed.  Really bummed because the bbq here isn't very good and we were happy to see a Dave's open.",

    "text": "I bought a Local Flavor (Groupon-type site) certificate for here a few months ago. It was $15 for $30 worth of food, plus they were having a 25% off sale. A twenty dollar savings was reason enough for us to check it out.   We arrived shortly after a nasty thunderstorm on a summer Saturday afternoon. As such, the place was crowded with families who were escaping Carowinds. There were only two of us so we sat at the bar. The bartender was awesome - very nice and friendly but I don't remember her name. They have the typical beers for the masses, plus some local ones such as OMB, Catawba, and Sugar creek. They also have drinks such as smoked bourbon which looked interesting.  We ordered the fried cheese curds as our appetizer which were good. For her entree, she got cedar plank salmon with steamed broccoli and corn on the cob. She said the salmon was delicious. I love Texas-style brisket, so I ordered that along with grilled pineapple and famous fries. The brisket was about six large, tender sliced pieces (not chopped). I did not have to use a knife to eat it. Although it was tender, it was somewhat lacking in flavor. However, it was still good. The grilled pineapple steaks had an unexpected kick to them but were also good. The famous fries were not something I would order again. They had no flavor and were a little on the dry side.   So, 3.5 stars for the food and an extra half star for the service equals four stars. I would go again.",

As a midwesterner who knows BBQ and grew up eating Famous Dave's  I expected that smoke to smack me in the face. It didn't. I ordered the brisket sandwich which was mostly marbling/fat with very little meat. I kept it simple with fries. I wanted to ease in. I wasn't wooed. Normally, the brisket is piled on the bun. The meat was undercooked but I understand that southerners eat theirs medium well down here. So, I'm not going to complain about that. The fat with the red meat tasted different but after I tired their sweet and spicy sauce I decided it was well worth the trouble. My sandwich was cold. No, more lukewarm as was the fries. I bought a ranch for an extra .35 because its made in house but its more dill dip than ranch.   I might have to give it one more try and eat inhouse before I say no more. The 3 stars is mostly due to Rachel as the food was not impressive.",

I am a stickler for checking Yelp before we eat places so I definitely went with high expectations since I saw a 4 star rating. My husband and I had the Catfish fingers with steamed broccoli,  garlic red mashed potatoes and the corn bread muffin. Our daughter had chicken fingers and fries.   Let's just say it was really really good.  I was looking for more pescatarian or vegetarian options  since I don't eat meat,but it was only the typical options given at a restaurant which was not all together bad  considering that a lot of barbeque places where we are from only offer French fries.   Overall, I definitely see us coming back to eat here next year when we visit Carowinds again.   Also the staff was very helpful and nice!!  Side Note: Please keep Mrs. Beverly's muffins on the plates.  They are AMAZING!!",

First off they are completely short staffed and the staff they do have seems confused with one exception to a very lovely server who basically took all of our orders although she was not our server. The food took forever to come out and when it did everything came out at once even though we had ordered an app. The wings we ordered were sweet n sassy very delish. The bbq pork sandwich although very tasty was a bit too smoky. The stuffed baked potato didn't have much stuffing but was an okay baked potato. My real qualms about this place are the prices are pretty ridiculous for southern food and the service was terrible. I will not be going back.",

    "text": "Ahhh, if they could just build one closer to Charlotte!!  Yum!  We first encountered a Famous Dave's BBQ in Northern VA, and we're hooked from the first taste.  The place has plenty of tables and room to put them together for big groups.  You can also see into the cooking area which is kind of neat.  Brightly lit, very courteous staff, very clean place.  We have tried just about all of the meats (bbq, brisket, etc.) and they are consistently tender & juicy from restaurant to restaurant.  They come \"naked\" but seasoned, and you can choose from 6 (I believe) sauces - from the sweeter to more savory to the Holy #$%& hot one!  I love the house one, not real sweet but has loads of flavor, hubby likes the Carolina one.  My kids have always loved their chicken tenders.  White meat, very light coating with their amazing spicy rub on them.  My son usually asks for a little side container of the rub so he can add more!  Husband &  I both love the brisket and pork bbq.  It is always tender with no gristle.  And can't forget their fries:  hot, crisp outside and sprinkled with their rub seasoning.  Prices are about average for a bbq joint, but if you have a choice - GO HERE!",

    "text": "My husband and I just happened into this place earlier in the week.  (Truthfully, we had a coin toss between trying this, or going to Moe's next door.)  Let me say, I was wowed.  As we walked up to the entrance, the door was opened by a lady with the biggest smile who already had menus in hand ready to take us to our table.  I don't think that she was a host, possibly a manager (she had on a burgundy polo and ran expo for most of our visit.)  Moments after we sat down, we were greeted by \"Famous Val\"- who was perky, sweet, and very helpful.  Val was one of the most attentive (but not overbearing) servers that I have ever had.  This girl never stopped going.  While most of the servers in the restaurant seemed to trod around and barely smile, Val whizzed around greeting tables, running food, and cleaning.  Amazingly, on top of all that, she seemed to know everything that we needed before we even had to ask her.    I think that the small portion of fries to taste test the variety of sauces before your entree arrives is fantastic!  I am always one to have lots of little dollops of sauce on my plate from tasting them all throughout my meal, but Dave's lets you taste test before your food even arrives.  On the topic of food, we ordered the boneless wings and one of the \"feasts\" to get a taste of a variety of offerings.  Everything was amazing (including the grilled pineappple!)   Overall, we will definitely be back!",

They did eventually get back to me, but it was a little weird that it wasn't on the menu and the server didn't know.  I got the two meat combo with rib tips and brisket. For sides I got Mac and cheese and grilled pineapple. It also came with a cornbread muffin. I wasn't a big fan of the meats. The ribs were a little better than the brisket but neither were great. I didn't really like all of the sides. The grilled pineapple was my favorite. I shared a banana pudding for dessert which I wasn't impressed by. It was mostly whipped cream and vanilla wafers with very little pudding or bananas.   All in all, I thought it was just ok. I would probably go elsewhere to get BBQ in the future.",

Cold food sucks! Called the store and was placed on hold for over 4 minutes, I finally hung up and went downstairs. The hotel was nice enough to heat my food and give me utensils. Stay away, there is better food nearby!",

Their collards had bacon and sausage (they are trying too hard to create something new instead of embracing simple goodness). I was surprised at the lack of quality in this place. I doubt I will be back.",
