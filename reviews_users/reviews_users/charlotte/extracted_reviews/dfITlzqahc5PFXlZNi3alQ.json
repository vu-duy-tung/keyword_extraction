    "text": "Nova's Bakery has been supplying Charlotte with baked goods since 1996, and a few months ago Nova's expanded their operations to include Nova's Bakery Coffee Shop in South End.  The 24-7 bakery and coffee shop serves hand crafted coffee and espresso beverages and baked goods straight from their mother location in Plaza Midwood.  They have a wide variety of fresh baked breads on hand, including sour dough, focaccia, and olive bread, plus bagels, muffins, and scones.  The coffee shop also offers an extensive selection of sweets, including cookies, cakes by the slice, and filled-to-order cannoli.  I can personally vouch for the walnut brownies, which taste especially good when warmed up at home and topped with hot fudge and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Just sayin.  While the coffee shop is small, there are a handful of tables and ample workstation seating with plugs and free wifi.  For a real steal, check out the half-priced day-old baked goods rack.  Nova's is a fantastic addition to South End, but there is one negative.  Even with all the delicious fresh bread they have stocked, they don't serve sandwiches.  Did I mention they're open 24 hours a day",

I have tried many of their breads, paisano, french baguette, 8-grain, and whole-wheat. By far, the whole-wheat is my favorite. It is rare that you find a bakery that creates a whole-wheat bread that is really whole-wheat and contains no added sugar but Nova's has perfected the art of creating a crusty and hearty bread and I am always sad when I run out. Every time I go I try to buy two loaves so I can freeze one but I find if you don't go early enough Saturday/Sunday mornings than run out! But you can't stop a delicious bread from being bought...so I will learn to share :). Seriously, once you try their bread store-bought bread will taste like dirt. It cannot replicate the texture or taste of bakery baked bread. The staff is always friendly, I do wish though we could tip on the iPad while using a credit card on the days I do not have cash. You can always tell this place is loved by Charlotte residents as every morning I go there is a couple, or a family eating right in front and people constantly getting coffee and baked goods to go.",

I've been a huge fan of their baked goods since they opened in Charlotte and I'm delighted to see not only a second location, but a round-the-clock bakery/coffee shop (Sorry, Amelie's...$3 and a 10 minute wait for a one-bite confection is not my bag).  The dessert case is well-stocked, as are the bread baskets and bagels and rolls. Even though the bakery itself is in Plaza-Midwood, I've not experienced any issues with freshness at this location. Delicious and flavorful, especially the challah and the marble brownies. The cookies will tempt you, too, so be warned. The coffee is fresh and there are several varieties and flavors to choose from.  The interior is small and you can tell it's an old building - most things in that part of town are, and I feel like seeing glimpses of what the space was before add character. The staff was beyond delightful, especially since it was late night that we went. Very happy and talkative - I felt like I was visiting a friend who was happy to see me.  I hope this location does well - they know what they are doing and Charlotte needs more than one or two quality 24 hour spots.",

Surely a bakery that is supposedly this popular must have good desserts. But no, second time I got a brownie and some carrot cake and was again disappointed. Still trying to convince myself this place had potential I tried it a third time and got a lemon meringue pie. Terrible. Lesson learned finally and I'm staying away from the desserts.

    "text": "This second location of one of Charlotte's very own is a nice addition to the neighborhood and fills a niche with it's 24/7 'round-the-clock schedule.  While nothing besides the coffee and lattes are made on premises, there are a good amount of breads, muffins, and treats that are available.  At least everything is made locally, however.  Some items appear fresher than others, so it never hurts to ask the staff when your intended purchases were made.  The inside has been nicely brightened up and features a couple of small tables and bar seating that faces out onto busy South Boulevard.  This would be a good spot to meet up with a friend or co-worker to just catch up before moving on to bigger adventures.  While there are a meager two parking spaces in front of the store, there are a few more around back.  This is not usually a problem unless you visit during the morning rush with the bagel store next door.  I do quite like their muffin selection, especially the 'Glorious Morning.'  It's like a carrot cake in a breakfast muffin and usually has a nice balance of moisture and flavor.  Not too sweet either.  I am also a fan of several of their loaf breads, made in a more European style, with crusty outsides and creamy interior textures.  Baguette is available here too, but I find it a bit lacking in comparison to other local offerings.  I've not tried most of the sweets here, so I'll leave that to others, but they sure do pack the display cases full with a seasonal selection.  There is never a worry you are getting 'the last one' of just about anything they have.  In all, I'm glad Nova's is here and I am glad someone else has the courage to go for the 24/7 schedule that is so lacking in our city.  For that alone, it is worth a stop in and a sample of what they have to offer.  Supporting locally-owned business?  Well that's worth another stop too.",

It seems that they are now settling in after being open for about a week.  They didn't have the espresso maker up and running right away and they were out of some of the different varieties of items.  However that all seems to have corrected itself in the last week.  Weither stopping in for breakfast or for coffee and dessert after dinner you will have plenty to choose from.  However please remember they are a coffee shop and bakery, I was in there the other day around lunch and there were quite a few people coming in looking for lunch type items which they do not carry. Lastly and what makes this place is the girl that works behind the counter (wish I had gotten her name).  She has been in there everytime I have gone (4 times in the last week) and she is always happy and cheerful.  Greets everyone with a smile and is patient while you try to make the difficult selection of what you will try that day.   Keep up the great work and I will keep coming back!!!",

We took home a lemon bar that was different than most I've had/made (more custard like), but it hit the spot later that evening.

Their ovens are not hot enough and are not steamed so the crust and rich, beautiful complex browning is completely missing; the batards come out white with a bit of tan color. The instructions indicate warming in a 375 degree for 2-3 minutes. Oh, well. It was to be a bakery after all, not a coffee shop, but whatever works is OK. It *is* a great place for coffee.",

Well girl, pick yourself up by your bootstraps and forget him. You can do better.   Oh wait, we're talking about a bakery. Right. I didn't give them a great review before, but it's gotten not only worse from a product standpoint and the bread/pastry products are terribly dry (seriously, they only have 3 decent food things - almond cake, paisano rolls and morning glory muffins) but primarily from a service standpoint. In case you didn't know, the bitchy boys are way more important than you and smugly will yell at you for several reasons, but especially if you try and help yourself to coffee beans. Hello? If you don't want self service, put it behind the counter or don't put out the bags! That's kind of a retailing basic.  The coffee is good, but not good enough to get the sh!tty treatment we get at Nova's. EVERY TIME.  Even hubs who works across the street agreed convenience is no longer enough to get him back. It's worth the drive to Dilworth Coffee, Central Coffee or Not Just Coffee. They're available, they're cuter and will treat you well.",

Not that I'm a 2am regular or anything (haven't been that way since my early 20s), but I truly appreciate late night businesses and wish Charlotte had more around-the-clock options.   My schedule is a bit backwards, I typically work late and so having the option of getting a fresh pastry to end the day is a treat! The main bakery is in Plaza Midwood off of Central. However, the items are made daily and sent to this second location.   I'm definitely a cannoli snob and I can confidently say theirs is pretty yummy! They have one of the best carrot cakes by the slice...and let's not forget their \"Glorious\" muffins! They make it all fresh.   They offer free WiFi and have select seating...mainly countertop looking out onto the street.   It's definitely a nice addition to South End...be wild and act young, I dare you to make a purchase after midnight!",

I would walk an extra couple of blocks to go to Sweet Lorraine's for treats.  As far as service, one person was really friendly and one was slightly edgy and impatient, so they canceled each other out.  Net score = 0.  Bottom line is that there is nothing drawing me into this place.  I would be just as satisfied going to Teeter for bakery bread.

    "text": "I visited Nova's Bakery for breakfast on a Saturday morning.  While Einstein's Bagel's was packed next door, Nova's had little wait.  Come on Charlotte!  Support your local place!  I took a bit to peruse the offerings and then settled on an apple cinnamon muffin and a vanilla chai tea.  The muffin was huge.  The apple and cinnamon flavors were spot on and the top had almost a crumb cake consistency.  I had been picking pieces off the muffin before I eventually got to the center.  There was a \"surprise\" inside. The filling was like a cream cheese/apple pie filling combination.  Honestly, I didn't love it.  The rest of the muffin two thumbs up though.  The Vanilla Chai tea was awesome.  Delicious flavor with just enough sweetness and warm flavors from the chai.  Delicious.  I'd return to Nova's next time I'm in the area.",

Staff was friendly, I made it just in time as they now close at 8pm on Sundays (not the listed 10:30). Took my goodies to go for a small treat when I got home. Baklava is yummy, although I enjoy it with more nuts typically, very traditional flaky, sweet goodness nonetheless. The brownie is dense, but not overly fudgy. I'll definitely return, but try different items next time.",

We came into the store about an hour before close. The girls offered us some bread that they were going to toss which was really nice of them!!   The dining area is nice and cozy.

I choose the organic, lighten it some, and dose it with honey to freshen things up... mostly worked, finished the day in relative peace :-) yea kindness! scone were nicely browned and dry (but not parched), light and crumby with spinach bits throughout; notes of spicy cheesy goodness added some zip without overpowering the basic composition. baklava were good but not great: saturated bottoms but not so much nutty goodness as I am accustomed. perhaps of a different geography?",

    "text": "We stopped here late one night on a whim. We were taking a walk around the neighborhood and noticed the bakery was still open. We stopped in to pick up a treat. As we were looking at the bakery case we noticed that there was a day old bin. I love the day old bin option! It's a great way for bakeries to get rid of product and a sweet way for customers to save some dough -- all puns intended. We picked out a bag of two cinnamon rolls for $2.   We had to pay in cash because there is a credit card minimum. Not a fan of credit card minimums.   The breads there looked good and a few of the other treats did too.   It's a small shop, it felt old. I couldn't really see myself sitting there and eating a treat. It's more of a to go option.   The cinnamon rolls were good - but not the best I've ever had.   I'd like to go back and try some other baked goods. When I do, I'll review again.",

Both unfriendly, however, today's service totally made me decide to never come back. The Americano tasted like water, I asked for a larger cup because I like to put a lot of milk in there, but instead the larger cup got filled up to the rim. There are no prices on the pasteries, and the place is dingy and dirty. The tables are sticky and it is only 10 am. And the prices are too high for such bad service and dirty place. Ob top of that they ran out of pennies (early in the morning) ). I used to love it here, but even Einstein Bros next door sounds now much better. This was my last time here. I wouldn't be surprised if others feel the same way.",

Their prices (especially on the day old products) are very reasonable, and a couple of the girls that work behind the counter are pretty cool. Notice how I wrote \"a couple,\" though. There are two other girls who have personalities that are not suitable for customer service at all. In fact, I had the misfortune of interacting with one of them today.   Once again, my coffee was FILLED with grinds. (I have taken a photo that will hopefully upload.) This seems to be a frequent problem, despite making suggestions on how to brew when dealing with a large wire basket (tuck the filter into the wire so the water pressure didn't fold it over).   Today's barista actually acted like it was completely normal to have \"a few\" grinds in the coffee. Bottom line, it's NOT normal. It's completely disgusting. It's also not good for the GI tract to ingest such quantities of coffee grinds.  There's a new bakery on South Boulevard about three minutes up from Nova's - some fancy French place, Renaissance something or other. I think I will start visiting their location instead.",

    "text": "This is my first and last experience at Nova's Bakery. When I arrived, I was on a important phone call so I sat in the parking lot while I was finishing my call. I had just pulled up and there is a woman berating a guy who was in his car in the spot beside me. The woman was yelling that this is her parking lot and it is for customers only and she was going to have him towed. They went back and fourth screaming and cursing at each other. After she gets this guy to leave she comes over to my car and is rudely knocking on my driver window... now she sees that I am on the phone with my window rolled up. I end up having to end my call because I'm being forced to deal with this woman. I roll my window down and she already has an attitude from running off the last customer she dealt with, with her hands on her hips, she asks \"What business do you have here in this parking lot?\" Well I was going to try out Nova's Bakery for my first time, but definitely not supporting that kind of behavior and I'm not willing to take the chance that you may have my car towed too. I did not go inside Nova's Bakery I ended up leaving because of this situation that made me feel very uncomfortable. Keep in mind that all of this happened within 5 minutes of me arriving to the parking lot. I called to inform a manager and he apologized, he told me people had been parking in the lot who weren't customers. I'm sorry, but that's not my problem. You picked your location. This is not an acceptable way to treat potential customers. What a terrible first impression.",
