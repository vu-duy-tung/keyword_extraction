So far, everything I've tried has been great.  The lobster roll is possibly my favorite entree; it's superbly prepared.  I'm about to rave about something that most people won't care about, but let me just say I absolutely LOVED their \"build your own\" salad.  So many restaurants want to fancy up a salad with weird, unidentified green vegetation, nuts, fruits, etc.  Sometimes, you just want a normal, iceberg lettuce salad with some more down to earth ingredients.  Also, they'll toss the salad for you with the dressing, so you're not sitting there with a little container of dressing trying to stir it up with a fork without spilling lettuce everywhere.  That was great.  Our servers have been awesome.  The beer selection is respectable.    The drawbacks - the bathroom floor has standing \"water\" - at least I can be optimistic and hope that it's standing water.  I think we know that it's water mixed with a lot of something else.  I almost slipped and came really close to falling face down in a urinal - not cool.  They should really fix that.",

The food is terribly over priced though and not anything special. So I don't get it why people suggest it anyway. They do have a great patio with a firepit and flat screen though. So a few friends and I decided to go watch the game and have some drinks on the patio and sit by the firepit. We were told by the hostess that the firepit was \"broken\". Oh. She said she thought the manager could fix it though. We sit by the closed unlit firepit. Order drinks. Then the manager comes out and asks how he can help us. I said we came here to sit around the fire pit and asked if he minded cutting it on. It was a chilly night recently. He said its broken. And walked away. Well, okay. Not going back.",

We put our order in first thing when she said hello it still took a good while to get the food. When I asked her if she knew how long it would be her response was \"its working\" the proper way is to go find out then give me a time frame, since my 4 year old has an internal clock of about 30mins max attention span. She did check on us consistently which put her in the plus one category to even out the negative. Overall a good place to eat depending on what you order. My favorite is the buffalo wings charred with blue cheese.",

That will not work either since we were told we could not add a chair to the end of the table. 30 mins later other groups as large as ours were seated we were again told our options. There were regular tables open for us, but they filled them so this option was taken away from us. The hi-top was out, the booth we were willing to try was not available. By now it has been 1 hour. We we were willing to try the booth, but we were told if it did not work we would have to go back on the wait list again. Nobody checked on us. We chose to leave. Worst service we ever had.

After waiting for 20 mins for a seat in the \"dining room \" we we jammed in up against the bar stools.   We were dining with a toddler, which can be challenging. After placing our order our waitress did not return. After waiting 45 minutes I did seek out a manager. Our food was brought out finally !   Portions seem smaller than a typical HT.

There was 3 of us who went to the bar to have some drinks. When I was carded, the waitress stared at my I.D and back at me, as if i was giving her a fake. After, she took my boyfriends card, and said she wasn't going to accept it because his picture had slightly started to fade over the last couple years of having it. He then presented his military ID and said for her to use this one. In this instance, she started becoming extremely rude. She started saying \"what is this going to be an issue, are we going to have problems here\", and was rolling her eyes. After she verified the ID she served him one drink and never asked if he wanted a refill, she only asked me. All the meanwhile, she never carded our other friend who was at the bar with us. We then asked to speak to a manager, not to get the waitress in trouble for doing her job, but to let her know that she can do her job in a polite manner. The issue issue was brushed off by the manager as well. There is a fine line between sticking to the rules, and then just wanting to be rude about it. If she was that concerned about his ID being slightly worn, then she should have upheld the other bar rules about carding the other guy we were with as well. Usually we have extremely nice waiters/bartenders, but last night proved otherwise.",

Surprisingly, Ma ordered the Carolina Burger with fries. I didn't expect her to order it since she has usually shied away from chili. She loved it, and ate all of it! I had the Smokehouse Burger with tater tots, and it was delicious. The buns were great as they were flavorful and did not fall apart.

What was produced was a nasty imitation made with \"bar booze\" and cheap liquor. Hickory Tavern had no qualms in charging for the higher quality product. Business needs to either charge accordingly or bartenders need a refresher. When people know their drinks, they know they are being duped. It is not appreciated.",

After being seated - we waited a total of 10 minutes before someone came over to our table to ask us what we would like to drink. The food is overpriced for the quality that you receive. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with fries and the sandwich was incredibly bland and it was served with a side of blue cheese dressing. The dressing looked and tasted as though it had been sitting under a warming lamp because the temperature of the dressing was rather hot and there was a film that covered the top of the dressing. I chose not to use the dressing.   Needless to say I probably won't return - which disappoints me because I was pretty happy to see an establishment open in Indian Trail with a good amount of craft beer on tap.",

Granted there are a few staples as well as a few locals on there, so all is not lost, but for crying out loud it is the dead of winter and style-wise all ya'll got is Guinness or a Milk Stout?  One of the most popular NC breweries is Olde Hickory - it's a no-brainer you should be serving a couple of those. To top things off, my waitress did not know the menu. at. all.  When I did finally get a beer, my Chimay Blue was served to me in a Pint glass (!)    Whoever created the beer menu needs to get out in the world or read a beer magazine...something.  I guess the beer list is a good match to the clientele...",

It just so happens that the host we should of had was an ex of my bf (I'm not putting names). Anyway, she made a big deal about us being there.

My thoughts on this one is that the owners went a bit too far when calculating what people liked at other locations. Specifically, the place really isn't that big, but it has 25 Televisions. It is just too much. The flashing images from literally every direction became annoying to me.  There are some cool quotes on the wall. I like that, but the bar itself has creepy lighting. I mean that. Like \"The Shining\" creepy.   The service was pretty quick and friendly. The pint of beer I ordered was so cold it had ice crystals still on the glass from the freezer. I always like that.   All in all, this place is fine for a beer before catching a movie, but I wouldn't want to spend too much time. Also, if you are looking for a social place, both times I visited, the place was fairly empty, but both times were weeknights at about 10 PM or so.",

Plus it smells better here than the other location. Almost a five but  I wasn't happy with the wait or that they can't let you sit at a high top because they have to seat you. If you are a party of one, I feel they should be able to get you in. Still, I'll be back and highly recommend this location. Even if it means I have a longer wait lol!!

    "text": "I was in Indian Trail visiting a close family friend and his family. We came here for dinner because they said they had never been here before. I ordered the crab dip, which lacked any visible crab meat. It was unimpressive and disappointing. My friend's wife had the fish tacos, and she said the fish tasted old, like it had been frozen, and wasn't fresh. I had a Tavern Burger. It was ok. Underseasoned meat, patty was not moist, bready bun. Thankfully it wasn't an expensive burger, otherwise I would have been irritated over its \"meh\" quality. Where I live, a good burger can cost $13-$16 at a sit-down/waiter service restaurant. There was a manager who was yelling at an employee in the service area, out of view. That did not matter as everyone in the immediate area could hear the yelling. Talk about trashy--this is the main reason I am giving a 1 star rating. Otherwise, it would have been a 2.5.",

Only small complaint is if it gets busy, the bar is so big it can be tough to get the bartenders attention.  I'll definitely be back!",

I couldn't finish them because I thought I was going to throw up.

They were out of several menu items that were ordered like the tequila for the margaritas (they actually tried to up charge for a different tequila). They were also out of flat chicken wings. We were told the large party before us ordered all of them. Several people received food that was undercooked (the chicken drumsticks and the ribs) It ruined what would have been a great time for some.  My food, however was great! I ordered bbq chicken nachos as an appetizer and a small tavern salad and sweet potato fries for my meal. I was also given a brownie sundae for my birthday.  Our waitress was great too!  My daughter dropped off balloons and a tiara for me around 1:30pm the day of the party because she wouldn't be able to attend due to her work schedule. She gave the items to the manager to give to the 7pm party. He told her it wouldn't be a problem and he would handle it. I never received those items from the restaurant (even after returning to retrieve them) We were told they were thrown away!!  I've attended several parties here before and never had a problem. I'm not sure what happened this time. My family and I will probably return however we won't host or attend anymore parties here.",

As soon as we enter we were graded and seated even offered a selection of where we would like to be seated as we dined me later found out it was trivia night we went able to stay the full time, but did enjoy the questions and games. They offered different specials on food and drinks depending upon the night we have the burgers which were tasty and delicious may just the way that we requested. We had the Moscow mule which was five dollars on Monday and came pretty strong it wasn't premade which is a nice plus. Service was great. Overall the place is clean and there are no concerns.

My friend ordered the tacos and I ordered chicken crispers with tator tots.   Seriously - 15 minutes after the appetizer was given our food shows up. It looked like it had been sitting in the window for 10 minutes. Tator tots were cold and the chicken tenders were overcooked and burnt.  Tacos my friend received were cold, the plate wasn't even wiped off. Finally had enough so spoke to server and she got a manager. The manager understood, comped the meal, and gave us a $30 gift card, that is the only reason this place gets a 2.

I'm very rarely disappointed and the Hickory was close to my venue so I just said sure this looks good. First let me say the staff is very friendly and this has nothing to do with them. However you must have more money than sense to eat here. I ordered buffalo chicken tacos and a beer. I received two small street tacos each containing one chicken tender, some cabbage and pico, along with some house made potato chips that only about one third of were actually crispy. If any of you have ever eaten at Cook Out and know the side item cajun chicken wrap this is essentially just two of those with some bad chips. Except at Cook Out they're $1.50 each. Also at Cook Out you get a main item plus two cajun wrap sides if you want for around $6. A quarter of what you'll pay here with tip. Again if you do eat here don't take it out on the staff. You should still tip. I was at least expecting some buffalo sauce on them but no. Literally this was one of the worst dining experiences I'v ever had and just felt ripped of in the end",

    "text": "Ugh, where do I start.  We arrived at 7:00pm and were promptly seated. Ten minutes later our waitress came over to take our drink order. I ordered a Diet Coke with several lemons (seeing that I need to clean the sticky mess off of the table, and lemon juice works well). While we were looking over the menu I did not see the Turkey Burger that the website said they had. Our waitress overheard us and told me that they still have it, so I ordered it. Five minutes later she returned to inform me that they in fact did not have the turkey burger. So, I ordered the California chicken sandwhich and a baked potato. It was 45 minutes later that we finally got our food. The rubber, mediocher chicken was plain, tough, and not worth $10. We begrudgingly ate the sub par food and were ready to leave. Again, the magical, disapereing waitress was nowhere to be found. When we finaly got her attention and she took my credit  card and check. She returned with a merchant copy for $4.61. I think she made a mistake so I attempted to get her attention to no avail. I then waved at another server, who pretended not to see me. The hostess walked by me and the exact same response. I finaly got a manager who thanked me for pointing out the error and returned with a corrected bill. So the issue beside the poor service and so- so food is, when a customer is asking to speak to you, waves his arms, shouts out \"Excuse me\" and is still ignored, that's the last straw. We will never go back (and my wife and I are fat, so we eat a lot).  Lastley in an effort to save time, Christina B. of Hickory Tavern may forgo sending me her canned, patronizing, smug response of \"Thank you for sharing your experience with us. I've forwarded your remarks to the regional manager to address. He'll look into it immediately. \"  That dribble will not only be wasted on me, the condescending nature of such a shallow person with deaf ears even addressing me (and other former patrons) is just insulting.",

    "text": "This is a classic sports bar styled restaurant. The quality of the food is nothing to rave about, but I will say that their shrimp and grits was delicious. The pimento cheeseburger was banging. Skirt steak tacos were also good. The bacon on the burgers was cooked well, and it's not too thin. The chips on the spinach and artichoke dip weren't too good - some were stale and undercooked. Also wouldn't recommend the chicken wings. They're pretty small and they have really thick skin on them.  On a final note, you can tell the management wants you to enjoy your experience and food. They fixed the issues we had during our visit.",
