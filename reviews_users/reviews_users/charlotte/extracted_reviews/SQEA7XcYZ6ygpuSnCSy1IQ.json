    "text": "We frequent Texas Roadhouse quite often, and tell friends it is one of the few places we always get great service, good food at a great value.  Until last night I cannot remember having a bad experience. We did call ahead as usual, and were told 30-45 minute wait, and we were  20 minutes out. When we arrived and checked in, we were told the same time. We waited at the bar for over an hour. At an hour fifteen, I went to the desk, and they said they texted us, but I had no text.... We were seated, and things were very normal until we got our dinner after about 30 minutes. We never got our salads..... We asked why the dinner came before the salads, and the waitress went to find out, and the did come about ten minutes later. Our son, who is a chef, and reluctantly goes to ANY chain, has always looked TR. he ordered a rare steak, that came looking like it was thrown on a hot frying pan for a few seconds and turned. There were absolutely no grill marks at all on the very gray colored steak. It was also ice cold. We don't usually complain, but spouses prime rib was cold also, and his was we'll done. My meal was fine with no complaints. The best part of the story was the young male manager who really wanted to make it right. We didn't want new food, as we had been there two hours, and my son was taking the steak home to his pup, he didn't want a credit, we just wanted them to know. Our bill came with a twenty dollar credit, which was very nice of them to do. We will of course go back, we have been going for as long as they have been in Charlotte, thanks for the excellent customer service!",

I walked in and gave the hostess my info, she told me to stand to the side and she will get a table for us. There must have been about 20 people behind me and she began to send people to be seated (did she completely forget me??) NO!!!! I was right in front !!!! She sat 6 tables from groups of 2/ 3/ 6. My husband came in from parking the car and asked me what was going on??? He jumped in and asked her what's the prob. We got seated immediately ?????? When we where walked to our booth I was expecting the usual greeting ( Hi!! Have you been here before). Nope that didn't happen. Our waitress was pleasant, but overwhelmed. Food was good, but hospitality could use some improvement. I don't think will be visiting this location again. The front staff NEEDS more training!!!! There attitude and arrogance don't help either.",

    "text": "This placed was packed on a saturday night when I came here for a birthday dinner. We had a 15 minute wait, which wasn't bad considering there was several big parties. There were several \"yee haws\" yelled throughout the dinner. Let's say when restaurants are busy, they want people in and out. In result this makes food orders come out extremely fast and I feel as if we were rushed in eating.   I have to make a comment about their rolls: CINNAMON BUTTER?! What were you guys smoking?! I mean, whoever made this up must have been intoxicated or absolutely a cinnamon lover or something. I personally think this is disgusting. There's nothing better than a nice roll (which they have) and nice normal butter. (Even though I think rolls with gravy is absolutely to die for)  Salad wasn't bad. I thought it was pretty good, their ranch dressing though is absolutely chunky though. At one point I was wondering if it was bleu cheese. Chili was my other side, which came loaded, which I have to say pretty delicious. I wish the onions were a little more cooked though. Other than that no complaints there. Anyways, on to the steak.   I ordered the New York Strip, cooked medium rare. (oh yeah, those who don't like blood, it's all about that juice!)  I enjoyed the steak. Lets say it was cooked really well, and it got me full! (I attached a picture if you want to see the inside) I also ordered the extra that topped the steak off with \"sauteed\" mushrooms and onions. Yeah, \"sauteed\" is key here. Mushrooms, yeah not bad it was pretty good. Onions? ABSOLUTELY RAW. You read that right.  My suggestion: Skip the extra sauteed mushrooms and onions on the steak. Spend that extra 1.99 on a drink and have more fun. Also, order that natural butter, because it will make that roll irresistible.",

    "text": "Surprisingly last night was my first visit to the old roadhouse.  I drive past it almost daily and there always seems to be a packed parking lot so I was always wondering about the hype surrounding this place.  I was told you get served a bucket of peanuts and that the environment was laid back, casual and fun.  The peanuts were True and the environment was indeed casual and laid back.  However, the food was just sub par in my opinion.  I mean they are a steakhouse but yet they offer mostly bar food so I don't think they did either exceptionally well.  You could apparently pick your steak from the display case by the entrance if you wanted but even that didn't cut it for me.    Oddly enough I chose to go with the Shrimp platter.  It was grilled shrimp on skewers that came with a lemon/butter dipping sauce.  It also came with three sides so I was stoked!  I chose the cup of chili, the sweet potato and the fresh veggies.  Shrimp:  Came out cold and was not grilled--it was pan seared and fishy.  The lemon/butter dipping sauce smelled and tasted like puke.  Cup of Chili:  Wendy's has a better chili.  This looked and tasted like the kind of chili you open from a can and put on your hotdog.  It was not good, not fresh and not hearty at all.  Side of Veggies:  It was just broccoli stuffed into a little cup with a few carrots mixed in.  The broccoli wasn't seasoned and it was cold, not cooked through and gross.  Sweet Potato:  Pretty hard to mess this up and it was quite good.  It was a baked sweet potato and it came with a side of cinammon, marshmallow gooey goodness.  It was good.  The buns that were served prior to dinner were a bleek attempt to replicate what O'Charley's used to offer.  They were basically frozen pieces of bread, thawed and drizzed with honey.  Some may say they were good but I was not interested.  Others at my table ordered chicken fried steak, salads, steaks, burgers, etc.  Some things looked okay others didn't seem edible.  The portions were huge and everything just seemed to be stewing in lard.  Bleh.  Another annoying part of this meal was that 4 times throughout the night one of the waitresses screamed at the top of their lungs to announce a birthday.  It was super annoying and continuously interrupted our meal.  I guess this is the place for that type of drama but I wasn't prepared for it and I didn't enjoy it.    I wouldn't come back here.",

Our server (and I am so sorry I don't remember her name) was absolutely wonderful - since we were newbies, she brought us a sampler tray with a few of their sides to try - delicious!  As we were only there for a quick lunch, we didn't have steak, however, the salads my brother-in-law and I ordered and the bacon cheeseburger my husband ordered were top notch!  The manager continually makes rounds throughout the restaurant and checked with us to see if we were satisfied!!!  We told him our server was excellent, the food was excellent and we would be back in the near future!

The prime rib was a bit tough and mainly boring. The corn was not on the cob, looked like frozen and the bacon on the potato tasted totally artificial.   I still like their Margaritas with an extra shot but I got nothing good to say about the food. The reason I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 is that service is always very good and it's cheap.",

    "text": "Round #2 at the Roadhouse and still... surprisingly... 4 stars.  Telling my mother I wanted to take her and dad out for their 47th anniversary (47 years!), instead of the nicer places that I rattled off, she picked Roadhouse (she must think I am one pricey dinner away from living in my 4runner, she won't let me spend any money on them).  So at 4:45 on a Saturday, we hit the silver fox crowd at the Roadhouse.  No wait when we arrived, since most people are still digesting lunch, Haley's section wasn't available (the great waitress from our previous visit), so we were sat in Joey's section - and we hit the server lottery again - he was fantastic.  Drinks stayed filled; he had suggestions for my diabetic, salt-sensitive, picky eater dad; attentive without hovering - he was top notch.    And I say this with a straight face, and it pains me mucho, but my order of the 20 oz. bone-in ribeye may have been one of the tastiest steaks that I have had in years (this goes up against steaks from Firebirds, Ruth's Chris, Capital Grille, etc.).  (I know!)  It was juicy, cooked to an absolute perfect medium and not overly seasoned as the mid-range steak places tend to do.  The accompanying baked potato was fluffy and jammed with butter, sour cream, BACON and cheddar (one of my last meals before starting Weight Watchers, I wanted to make it count).  The onions that I got as a side needed to be cooked a little longer for my taste, but they were okay.  The salad that came before everything was served in a chilled bowl with fresh ingredients.  And the rolls were warm and soft, served with their cinnamon sugar whipped butter.  Mom was happy with her ribeye (even though she thought she ordered a prime rib) and dad was satisfied with his salmon, but I think I got the top meal of the night.  Excellent service, surprisingly good food - good job, Roadhouse!",

The wife had to send hers back to be re-done, I ate mine anyway.  Overseasoned to the point of being objectionably salty on the outside.  Almost a salt crust.  Fries were leathery; obviously were old and re-heated.  The staff was fine, our waitress was reasonably attentive, but the food was unfortunately awful. Maybe they do better with steaks, but will not be back.",

    "text": "I've been coming here with my family for as long as I can imagine. This place has a close spot next to my heart and this past visit was no different. Once you enter, the whole floor is covered with peanut shells. Don't fret, this is normal here. Texas offers complimentary peanuts while you wait for your table.   While you walk to your table, you are able to choose your own steak. Once you get to sit down, you're blessed with their signature dinner rolls with cinnamon sugar butter. Oh man, let me tell you about their rolls. I generally avoid carbs (you know, gotta try to stay healthy) but when it comes down to these suckers, I finished a whole basket and asked for seconds. They always come hot and the cinnamon spice in the butter is a nice touch.  My family always order the fried pickles as a starter. They taste better than most places I have ordered them. The pickles are always fried til they are crispy but still juicy in the inside. Now, onto the entrees. My mom loves ordering the prime rib but sadly it is only available on the weekends. I order myself a ribeye, cooked medium rare. When the steak came out, it was cooked as close to medium rare as I could ask for. A problem that commonly occurs in chain steakhouses is that they always overcook their steaks. Texas does not have this problem and I applaud them for that. However, the steak had a bit too much fat for my taste. Therefore, I had to cut out about a fourth of the steak and was left with less steak then I would wish for.  I have never tried their desserts as we are generally too stuffed to order them. Maybe next time, I will give it a try. For the price of their entrees, I would consider them a bargain. For less than twenty bucks, you get a good chunk of steak, 2 sides, and all the dinner rolls your heart desires. Will I come back? Of course! While the quality of the steak is subpar, what keeps me coming is the server's good attitude and the dinner rolls. Maybe next time I'll ask if I can just order a dozen of their rolls to go.",

She was prompt, courteous, and very attentive to any need I may have had.  I couldn't have asked for better food and service.  Manager stopped by table to check on me as well.

Our visit was filled with loud, constant music to the point in which you couldn't hear yourself talk and weren't sure if family friends and wait staff could hear you well either. Roadhouses typically have a slight elevated ambiance in terms of volume normally but it was obnoxiously loud (very loud audible music, more so than normal/usual) during today's visit which may or may not have effected how well some of the food was prepared for tonight's order. They (waitress, etc) tried really hard to ensure that the service was good and that the food was good but it the experience, at least for me, didn't have the typical Texas Roadhouse feel to it. Too noisy and I truly think it may have possibly affected the preparation of some of the food that was ordered. I rated 4 stars but I truly felt it was more like a 3, 3.5 star experience/review.",

For drinks I tend to get sweet tea which is not the best, last time I tried my boyfriends strawberry lemonade and it was surprisingly really good. Moving on, the waiting time is usually not that bad for the most we've only waited almost 10 minutes. But on our last visit... It was ridiculous!!!!! We did get a complimentary appetizer. Our waitresses are always super nice and attentive. Also almost every time we go there the manager goes around and ask how everything was. I love that.",

Tonight was exceptionally well. Brett was by far the best server we have ever had. Our immediate family is very large and we always have to sit at two separate tables. He coordinated the service amazingly, put forth the effort to ensure our orders were taken at the same time, that food came out together and that is something that has never been done for us. He had a great attitude, constantly checking to see if we need anything and not once did we have to ask for a refill. One of the best customer service experiences we have ever had. Needless to say, we will be requesting Brett from now on!",

The steak was cooked medium well as ordered, well seasoned and tender. The ribs were tender and came off the bone easily. Not to crazy about BBQ sauce on the ribs, but I'm not a sauce person. The sides were also delicious. Our waitress was very nice and gave very good service. The pre dinner rolls were warm and light, and came with delicious cinnamon butter. We also ordered a onion blossom which was ok, but not as good as Outback steakhouses'.",

    "text": "This is my third chance for this location.    First visit was very disappointing, (1 star) so we waited a couple of months to give them another chance, the food was better but the service was still amiss (2.5 Stars).  This time we seemed to have the same type of disappointment  we used to get at the Pineville Location that closed down over a year ago.  For starters, we were seated toward the back of the restaurant, away from the the main dining area.  This is usually where the worst service occurs because it is out of the line of sight of the servers.  It took approx three minutes prior to a server approaching our table, and taking our drink order.  Since we were under a fan (circulating on high) we requested that the fan be turned off.  The staff quickly obliged, however they turned off the entire fans throughout the whole restaurant. I am not sure that this bothered me, however it may have effected others  as we were the only ones in our section.  I requested a house salad, no tomatoes, no eggs, no onions, with EXTRA cheese, no dressing, and my wife had the same setup with Ranch dressing.  When we received our salads, neither salad had ANY cheese at all.  This was quickly addressed with the server, and she brought out two small cups of cheese (which we were charged $1.00).  We looked at each other with what could be next, as we already started to have a bad experience. We proceeded to enjoy the salad, as it was fresh, and the plates were cold.    Now the steaks come out.  I ordered a 10oz Ribeye (medium), with fries, and my wife had the 6oz sirloin (medium )with a baked potato. My steak was cooked perfectly, the fries were hot and well seasoned.  I was quite happy.  My wife,  on the other hand now that is a different story.  Her steak appeared to be cooked perfectly, however it was well done, with no pink in the middle.  We quickly addressed this to our server and she asked if we would like another steak.  She promptly stated that we jut wanted to end this dining experience, as how hard can it be to cook a steak, if all you serve is steak.  A manager (Gary) promptly came over, we expressed our experience, and our previous disappointments at this location and he was generous enough to comp her meal.  The steak while overdone to her taste (not as ordered and as we like) was shown to the manager in front of the server and both agreed that this was not acceptable.  The explanation we received is that they had a new cook in the last week or so, and they were trying to improve the consistency to this location.   I am all about second chances, but this location fails to be consistent, except in its ability to be inconsistent.   Our server was very friendly, and after we were initially greeted by her, she did everything that she could possibly do.  The food being overcooked was not her fault.  In both cases, food runners brought the food out, and therefore she was unable to notice any problems that she may have been able to correct.  I may be back to this location, but it will be months down the line.  This place is a hit and miss for us, but I must say that the management did step up, admit an error, and comped the meal which was not satisfactory.  NCFoodGuy",

OUT OF CHICKEN??? So proceeded to order the \"country fried chicken\" w/ mashed & gravy. When the tables food came it looked great, big fried piece of chicken w/gravy but upon eating it....let me just say \"COUNTRY\" fried you better believe it. That gravy is beyond country. You taste the whole damn farm. It tastes how cow poop smells, No other words to describe it.  I took one bite and about vomited on the table.  Sent it back and got a different replacement meal to go as the party I was there with was about done eating before to go meal came.  A manager then came to our table and asked if I still wanted the chicken, it was \"now available\" Why wasn't I told by my server that it was cooking and WILL be ready shortly?? I still would of just ordered that and waited.  Appetite was ruined after tasting the whole farm in one bite. In conclusion it wasn't our first trip, as my family likes their steak but that made it our last. I'm NOT impressed....the ONLY good thing on the menu/served are the sweet yeast rolls n butter. Oh and by the way, don't expect HALF a chicken...a baby chicken or maybe a pigeon...but this is the smallest half chicken I've ever seen in my life.",

    "text": "First off let me start by saying, that the food is terrific!!! There is no doubt about that. The steak is always cooked exactly how it is ordered, and the chicken is nice and juicy. Not to mention, I would probably come here just for the bread and cinnamon butter if I could. LOL. If it wasn't for the poor service I would definitely have given this place a 5 Star rating. The hostesses are extremely rude when you first arrive. As a matter of fact the first time I came to Texas Roadhouse I almost left because they acted as if they could not be bothered by me. I went again last night for dinner, and the hostess gave us our number, and then told us it would show up on the board when our table was ready.. my stepmom and I went and found a seat directly in front of the board and literally watched it like a hawk (because of our extreme hunger) and our number never showed up. After about 45mins, we went up to the host station where the hostess rudely told us that she called our number on the loud speaker even if it didn't show up on the board. . . First of all this would not be such an issue if we were not sitting directly in front of the hostess station the entire time, and if the restaurant was not so loud because then you would be able to actually hear what is or is not being said over the microphone. So after that mix up the hostess tells us there is a table available if we would like, we are then escorted to a table in the bar (which is first come first serve regardless).  Needless to say that put a sour taste in my mouth. When you come here expect good food, and ok service. Our actual waitress was great, but the hostesses are the face of the restaurant and should really be aware of how they treat customers.",

To be honest I wasn't totally excited about coming here, thinking it is just another \"typical steakhouse\". I was wrong. Service at the hostess stand was the definition of chaos. We had called ahead, gotten a number, then when we got there realized they had given someone else our number as well. So the other table was sat, and we had to wait. 5-10 min we were told, after 15, we went back up to the stand to ask when we would be seated. We got a confused look, and they just said, \"Oh we will seat you right now!' Ok whatever, just get us seated and give me those rolls with cinnamon butter that I have heard so much about.  Service was incredible, our waitress was very sweet, and we never had to ask for anything. I ordered the ribs, with chili and french fries. Ribs = A OK. Fall off the bone for sure. Fries, were fries. The chili on the other hand was great!!! Menu says its \"house made Texas red chili\", tasted home made for sure.  Everyone else at the table was very happy with their steaks, all cooked as ordered. Overall great experience except for the little hiccup at the hostess stand. But that's what happens when you leave the entire front of the restaurant to be run by 16-17 years olds.",

If you have a peanut allergy, you should probably stay away any Texas Roadhouse establishment. #allofthepeanuts  We came to eat on a Saturday night before a trip to the movies. It was packed and there were a lot of people waiting. Luckily, Andrea's husband called ahead to put our names on the list. We walked in and were seated about five minutes later. Sorry to everybody else. Actually, no. Sorry, not sorry.  Our service was great. I got a ribeye with grilled mushrooms and onions, loaded baked potato, and a salad. We also went through two baskets of rolls. If you have no will power, don't agree to the second basket. My steak was cooked perfectly. I really liked how the server came back right after we got our food to ensure that all our steaks were cooked properly.   This is a fairly large Texas Roadhouse. It does get quite busy, so keep that in my mind if you plan to head here on a weekend night.",

Despite arriving in the last hour of business, our waiter Levi was attentive, friendly and accurate, remembering extra sauces and butters and moving quickly without rushing us. We were served hot rolls and cinnamon butter AS we were seated, and then a sampler of sides - free. Just \"Hey, check out this awesome food and make your decision WAY harder!\" Drinks followed, quickly joined by our few appetizers and main course. Healthy portions, fresh produce and their chili is awesome! No desert tonight but I'll be a new regular. The manager walked by to personally check on clients, but it was an unnecessary courtesy - we were delighted!",

Great food, great atmosphere and a wonderful staff. I will be coming here, bringing friends and family forever. They have call ahead seating, if you are coming at a peak time, I would suggest putting your name on the list prior to arriving. They are so good people are lined out of the door waiting for the excellent food that they offer. Thank you Texas roadhouse for showing other restaurants what steak is meant to be!",

    "text": "I went here 7/14/18 with my boyfriend. I ordered an 8oz sirloin medium rare. Come out perfect. My boyfriend ordered a 6 oz fillet. Cut into the middle of it and the center was cold and red. Our waitress took so long to even come greet us that we were ready to order our meal by the time she showed up for drink orders. After this we had another waiter hunt her down for the undercooked steak. My parents actually ended up coming but sat at the bar. This entire time I'm texting my mother about how we were being treated. My parents go about once every 6 weeks and are well known by the staff. When our waitress finally came for the steak she looked at us both and went \"which one\" we started to say his when she grabbed a plate and just walked off. My mother showed a manager our text and that's when he was sent our way. He spoke down to us explaining what medium rare was. We know what we ordered and what we got was NOT medium rare. Is was practically raw. But at this point it was our word against the waitresses because she had already discarded the \"evidence\"    After this the manager said dessert was on the house for the inconvenience. We said thank you and waited for my boyfriends food and to order dessert. We did and asked for the bill. Not only were we charged for both his and mine steaks (2 not 3) but we were also charged for the dessert! We waited 7 minutes again for this waitress and explained to her (insert managers name here) told us dessert was on them. She went \"Oh really is that what (insert managers name here) said.\" We said yes it is and again had to wait about 8 minutes for the fixed check. She never once apologized for any inconvenience. I'm 21 and my boyfriend is 27. We don't need to be spoken down to or treated like this. I was very disappointed in service especially because the manager even told me \"hey you know your moms here right?\" And they still spoke down to us. My parents are good customers of theirs. Like I said the staff knows them. They knew I was their daughter. Regardless of my parents being known there I feel as if my parents didn't have some influence on the situation we would have been treated much worse than we were. I hate that I even had to involve my parents but we were so disrespected. It hurt. It's gonna be a while till I got back to a Texas Roadhouse. Not sire if I'll ever go to this location again",

    "text": "We visited this restaurant and can't wait to go back again. It is a very long drive from our town, but well worth the time spent getting there. Some of the best food we have eaten.  I had the 12 oz ribeye steak, with a loaded baked potato and a caesar salad on the side. The steak was perfectly done (I ordered it medium rare), very nicely seasoned (did NOT need any steak sauce) and nice and pink inside. The flavor was amazing. The potato was perfectly done and I had ordred it loaded, which is optional (sour cream, cheese and bacon bits) which made it almost a meal in itself.    ordered the rack of ribs. Falling off the bone tender. He does like them saucy, so he had them bring some extra sauce,which they were very happy to do. He had a baked sweet potato with butter, and baked beans. The baked sweet potato was butter soft, it was very good with just butter. And the baked beans were smoky tasting and had just a little kick, without being overly spicy.   Both of us had more than we could eat, and were able to take home our leftovers and had them for lunch the next day!   We split a baby cactus blossom onion appetizer, and it was a lot for two people. The people next to us got the regular sized one and it took up an entire large dinner plate! Very very good and the sauce served with it is to die for.   I love iced tea, and they make it just like I was used to when I lived down South. I usually do not drink sweet tea, but here I did. The sweet tea was so good!   The only thing we didn't care for is the amount of noise in the restaurant, but that was a small thing. Sometimes though it was hard to hear what we were saying to each other. The servers were wonderful, and the manager went table to table, making sure everything was okay with the guests. They put a high priority on customer service.  If you have a peanut allergy, this is a place to avoid. They have tins full of roasted in the shell peanuts on the tables, and there are peanut hulls on the floor in the waiting area (and this place is busy in the evenings, so you would probably have to wait). There is bound to be peanut dust in the air...so this would not be a good place for a person with that kind of allergy to visit.",

Loaded potato was very good. My date had the filet. Why anyone want a boring steak I will never understand but it was cooked perfect for her. And that's what counts. Great service, especially for a Sunday after church let's out.   Only big Negative was the peanuts were very Very stale.

I'm also guessing someone spilled their soda because our table was soaked in soda. We decided to move to another table because of how messy our table was and due to the fact that our waitress never came to greet us. Had a good experience with our new waitress until our food arrived. The women who brought our food literally said \" I would of been your server if you didn't move\" with a very bad attitude.

The steak is always cooked just the way i want it to and the mashed potatoes are absolutely delicious! Literally mouthwatering! The corn is also the perfect mix between sweet and salty and is actually perfectly seasoned. Today i decided to order online because i didn't have time to go out and eat at the actual restaurant. I ordered an 8 oz medium rare sirloin. When i went to pick up my order, a little after the estimated time, it still wasn't ready. I waited a little longer but the workers couldn't find it. She then found my order and i was on my way. When i came home and opened the box, i was extremely disappointed. The meat was beyond well done. It was extremely dry and thin. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. The sides were flawless as always though. This won't stop me from eating in the restaurant but i don't think I'll be ordering online anytime soon.",

    "text": "I wish there were more locations.  It's difficult to get into because you have to enter off hwy 51 and are unable to enter the shopping center from independence boulevard.  I think they have great prices for the quality of food.  You can pick out your own steak from a meat case upon arrival if you wish.  Those steaks are larger and more expensive.  Everyone at my table either had the 6 or 8 oz sirloin with different sides.  I really like their side salad because it comes with a boiled eggs on top.  Great home made ranch dressing. They have early bird specials that are great deals that I believe are served from 3pm-6pm Monday through Friday.  I will warn you, it is extremely loud and not a great place to have a conversation with your fellow diners.  They serve peanuts in a shell at the beginning of the meal.  They also have amazing yeast rolls served through out the meal that are bottomless.  There is a large bar area with plenty of TVs available for viewing.   I had a friend book a small private party and request a private room.  The restaurant said they could accommodate however, upon arrival the \"private\" dining  room was actually just a very small corner inside the main dining room.  There was nothing private about it at all. Beware of that if you ask for a private dining room. I will go back here again.",

Came in on a Thursday night and was soon seated. They offered that I pick out my steak from the window if I wanted one. Upon being seated there was a large bucket of peanuts. They also brought fresh bread that had a brown sugar mix with it. The server was nice she really took her time to explain things to me and even brought out mini samples for me to try the sides to see what I wanted! I loved this. I got the hurricane which was light and fruity. It was recommended. For dinner I had the barbecue chicken with mash potatoes and veggies. I like that the veggies were steamed and didn't come with any seasoning I could do it myself. The mash potatoes were made fresh. The staff went above and beyond to ensure we were accommodated. Didn't get a photo of the main course by the time the food came out I totally forgot and ate it up. I was hungry. The place was clean and I will probably return. I recommend.",

We then waited an additional 5 minutes for the waitress to come take our drink order after receiving the drinks we placed our order! And I asked for some bread being we had not yet received any (the bread is the only thing come this this restaurant) at which time the waitress said \"we don't have any yet but I will bring you some soon\"!   So we waited about 8 minutes later we get these 1/2 sized rolls that looked like they didn't make the cut!  The waitress proceeded to tell us \"these are better then nothing and I will bring the good ones out soon\".    So after waiting 25 minutes after ordering the food came    Both of us ordered sweet potato. Both of us removed the marshmallows because they were burnt beyond recognition. Kathy also order veggies for her second side which was under cooked (raw) her steak was good though.   I order my steak medium well and it came well done Extra chewy!      So when we get done eating the waitress brings us some more rolls burnt by the way in which we refused them because we were already done eating.   If your going to open at for then open not, not doing half the job!",

A year ago, my wife's salmon was raw. 6 months ago my fries were still frozen. Tonight? Took 50 min to get our food, and the jalapeno poppers were not hot. Like temperature. The boneless wings? Cool to the touch. My son's chicken fingers? Cold. We sat there so long I filled up on bread and could have left. My wife's food was hot and delicious. The server was nice. After sending the food back twice, we just are mediocre room temperature food. The manager was so helpful she took a whole ten dollars off! Wow! Maybe I can go buy a pack of gum or something. Yeah I don't think we will be back. Sucks too because we have been to several and the establishment just seems a bit sub par. The one in Rochester NY was fine. Concord by great wolf lodge? Same thing. Long wait for food and cold when u get it. Go somewhere else like Macs in Matthews.  Update three hours later and I've spent the last one in the bathroom spray painting the thunder mug. Cold food = food poisoning.",

Passed the time with the peanuts LOL.  Service was great! Waitress was super friendly. Portions were huge. I ordered pork chops with a sweet potato and apple sauce. Everything was great. Chops were juicy and tender. Sweet potato was yummy.  Had so much I had to take some home. Will have to go back and try the steaks or ribs. They looked delicious from other members of my family.",

Gradually over the last couple of years, the quality is nowhere near as good. We come here often, so I'm not speaking of any isolated event. Now when we go, we get mediocre service from not so friendly servers, dirty tables, and the rolls are terrible now!! The servers always seem to have an attitude and treat you like cattle. I'm constantly asking for new \"clean\" silverware because they are not washed properly, management is nowhere to be found and the food quality has decreased. I used to be able to get a medium rare steak when I ordered it, but now it's really whatever the chef decides. I don't think we will be giving this location another shot, I'll drive a little bit farther to another location. Such a shame, because we used to eat here every month.",

The main issue was that the kitchen staff had no clue what they were doing.

However, I just visited and the quality of the food has gone down?  Their \"hot-out-of-the-oven\" fresh bread was like a big dry round biscuit.  Their \"fall off the bone ribs\" were dry and had no taste unless I drenched it with bbq sauce. Their vegetable medley used to have sort of a warm lemon butter flavor but my broccoli was gross and so overcooked, I couldn't even pick it up with a fork... it was like eating mashed potatoes?! And their salmon used to be moist and flavorful but now it's dry and overcooked, with little to no taste.  They've even stopped placing lemon slices on the salmon?  Really Texas Roadhouse, I can't get a slice of lemon for my fish?  Overall, the only thing that helped on my last visit was the side salad that came with my entree. I like their Caesar dressing, so I found other leftovers at home (chicken, tomatoes, carrots) and threw them on top of the greens to make my meal. I would have given them one star but after speaking to the manager, he apologized and stated he'd give me a credit so that my next meal would be taken care of.  Unfortunately nothing was done for my inconvenience of having to find other food to eat that evening.",

This location is very big, and was a bit crowded when we arrived. No complaints though, because it was a Friday night.  The servers, while busy, were very attentive and we got our food fairly quick. I have to say I love the rolls and the butter that comes with them YUM!  My boyfriend and I both got Ribeye Steaks,  medium. They were cooked they way we like them, but there was just way to much salt. While the steaks were juicy, we couldn't help but notice the overpowering salt flavor.   Normally previous Texas Roadhouse experiences have been alright, but this time my boyfriend got a rock in his salad, how does that happen? The good thing is he didn't chip or break any teeth biting down on it. The manager on duty, Sarah, was very understand and gave him his meal for free, the situation was handled well.   Overall our experience was ok, nothing that will keep us from coming in, or not coming again.",

Unfortunately I wasn't impressed  I could elaborate on how all of the steaks were not cooked to order and mine even came out moo-ing, but what's the point?

Anyway, after a short wait we sat and I had the NY strip and she had the Dallas Filet.  I found my steak to be cooked to order (medium) and full of juicy goodness.  The Dallas Filet on the other hand left my better half a little disgruntled.  Apparently it was fatty which shouldn't happen on a Filet.  On top of that she wasn't a fan of the green beans that had a infusion of bacon in them.  Me, I'll take bacon in any form.

    "text": "O how I love to eat ribeye.  The juiciness in your mouth is so...wait, wait...I'm getting ahead of myself here.  Let's save the food for last!  Texas Roadhouse, always a casual dining experience.  Want something to munch on while waiting on a table?  Go ahead and grab some peanuts!  I'm not a peanut kind of person, but if I was, I would enjoy that little detail.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere with some swanky decorations found around the place.  The country music playing in the background as well made me feel like a country girl inside.    The staff there is pleasant to serve you.  I have always walked in and been greeted with a smile from the hostess, even when it has been crazy busy and hectic in the waiting area.  A fact that I love about when the employees seat us is that they do not seem to judge me when ask for 2 cups of butter for my rolls that they grab when seating people.  Okay okay...the good stuff now.  Food.  Let me start off in order.  The rolls are BOMB.  The employees always grab a basket of rolls when seating you, so you're sure to have something else to munch on while waiting for your server.  My favorite appetizer are the rattlesnake bites.  Jalapenos and cheese battered and fried!  You just can't go wrong with that.  I order a Cesar salad, standard.  Then my ribeye comes into view, looking succulent as always.  I drool as soon as I see that sexy piece of meat coming my way.  The first bite is delightful as always.    I would tots recommend this Texas Roadhouse location for a fun and casual dining experience in the Matthews area.  Yee-haw!  *tips hat*",

There were two buckets of peanut on the table, some yeast rolls w/ the cinnamon butter. Upon Dan (waiter) getting our drinks and asking if we were ready to order I looked to pickup my menu and noticed a MAGGOT ON THE TABLE..thats correct: A maggot. I swiped it away, Dan apologized, gave us a moment, then returned and apologized again w/ the offer of speaking with the manager. The manager apologized said it was most likely from the peanuts & offered free dinner on next visit. Needless to say we left immediately & WILL NOT be returning. ( if maggots are in the building/peanuts: NO THANK YOU)",

Servers wear shirts that say, \"I love my job\" and it is easy to believe with the friendliness and aim to please attitude.  I must say, I don't get that vibe from the hostesses though. Food is always excellent!!  Oddly enough I always get the veggie plate at a steak joint!  But always fresh and delicious. My Husband & Father love the ribs-they smell intoxicating.  Mozzarella sticks are by far my favorite over any other restaurant.  Peanuts on every table are always a plus.  Family favorite!!",

She clearly forgot to put our order in because people that arrived to the restaurant after we placed our order got their food before we did. Then when she split the check she tried to charge me for a steak I did not order. She was slow, flaky and talked way too much. It took us over an hour and a half to order, get our food & pay for it. We beat the lunch rush so there was no reason for this delay. I'll go back, but I will not sit in her section again.",

We were a party of 6 from out of town and even though we got there at 9:30 when they close at 10 they still took us in and were awesome. Sarah was our server and she was so awesome! She totally made coming here worthwhile! She was happy and energetic and didn't seem at all bothered that we got there right before closing time. We loved their bread so we asked for some to go, and even though they had thrown all the leftover bread out, they baked a fresh tray for us to take with us since we are from out of town. So the cook and the baker were also awesome. Overall a great experience. Will definitely come back!!",

During the week it's way less congested we didn't have a wait at all tonight. We are always promptly greeted and when you get to your table they serve you delectable hot fresh rolls with cinnamon better and you can have all you want. It is quite nosey in here again more so on the weekend or holidays so be prepared to talk loudly. Tonight I ordered the 8 oz sirloin medium with mushrooms, loaded mashed potatoes and a house salad. The salad is fresh crisp lettuce, tomato, bacon, egg and croutons, the dressing my choice ranch is exquisite. The steak was served perfectly cooked and the potatoes were luscious. My niece got a loaded sweet potato which comes with cinnamon butter and marshmallows this is her favorite. I have had the rice, corn, baked potato, green beans , and chili on other visits and they are all very good. Our service was really nice and very attentive and I have never had a problem with the staff they are always very nice and willing to do whatever you ask. I recommend if you are in the mood for delicious steak Texas Roadhouse is where you want to go. Its way better than its 2 competitors down the road.",

I'm hesitant to send it back to the kitchen so I always say it's fine, take it home and throw it on the grill. However, the quality of the food is good and the service is usually average to good, but never bad. Outback was my favorite at one point in time. Not now though. Roadhouse has them beat. Longhorn is under quality and over priced. I'll stay with Roadhouse.",

    "text": "Friday after \"Snowmaggedon 2014,\" which happens to be Valentine's Day, we opted for a dinner that's easy on the budget and low on the romance factor. As expected there was a crowd by the front waiting for their tables, it's a dinner nightmare trifactor (a Friday night after 3 days of snow prison AND a special occassion for some). I didn't really care since I was highly occupied by the barrel of peanuts sitting right by the doors. As I was throwing peanut shells on the ground (sidenote: I always feel guilty doing that... I mean, they are such messes and someone has to clean that up at some point), I asked about the bar. Since I wasn't there to stare into my lover's eyes (ya, definitely no), I would be happy just to sit down anywhere. And lo and behold, 2 empty bar stools at the end!   The 3 ladies working behind the bar were just friendly enough and efficient. Since all 3 of them were available to serve, we didn't have to wait long to get drinks or food. The most impressive part was when one of them found out we haven't been to the eatery before, she brought out 4 little samplers of side items for us to taste. That was very thoughtful. All the sides were good but the mashed tater was the best. The chili was solid and filling. Green beans aren't for the vegeterian/vegan folks as they were immersed in bacon goodness. The corn was... just corn. Oh ya, the soft rolls with cinnamon brown sugar butter.   I started with the house frozen margarita with an extra shot of tequila for $8, which isn't bad for the amount of drink I got. Brain freeze anyone?!  I also ordered a 10 oz ribeye, which was cooked to perfect medium rare with just enough seasoning. I ended up with the baked sweet potato which made good leftover to go. Filet was solid as well. The food is no thrill but good. What we spent on a meal for two would barely pay for a steak for one at a fancy place, which normally is my biggest beef (steakhouse... beef... got it?!) about eating steaks when out. If I can get a solid slab of meat for $10, it's hard to justify 3-4 times of markup. The menu prices are very reasonable here, I can see why it's popular with families.  Overall excellent visit. I even got a small das boot (hmm... das cowboy boots, a cross between Texas and Germany) for $5, and that was my romantic V-Day gift to cap off the ultra non romantic night out.",

The hostesses are so friendly and always bubbly, which is refreshing from all the other restaurants where hostesses look and act like they are miserable. Any way back to the point. From the moment you walk in you feel welcomed. The wait staff is just as inviting!!     Now. Let's talk food!! The bread is probably my favorite bread in the entire universe. I have to give credit to the butter that comes with it but hey give me some bread and butter and I'm happy!! My kids would only eat that if I let them, and if I didn't feel like I might be judged by the surrounding tables. We usually don't get an appetizer cause we all know what we want, and instant gratification is kind of our thing. I always order the Road Kill, medium well, with a side salad and baked potato. My husband is always trying a different steak. The food is always seasoned well and just well prepared. Texas Roadhouse is a well oiled machine that is a good restaurant that will get it right!!",

With that said, I had never heard of Texas Roadhouse before a few months ago, but even so, I've been about 4 times since my initial visit. The portion sizes are huge, flavorful, and very reasonably priced. I'll go here for dinner and have enough leftovers for lunch the next day. Plus the yeast rolls with cinnamon butter are fantastic!   The only downfall of this location is service. I've had some fantastic waiters and waitresses, great attitude and excellent suggestions, but this location seems understaffed. Tables often stay dirty for a while and even though my waiter/waitress is running around constantly, my drink goes empty or I need something with my food order and no one is around to assist. This is a busy location and I don't expect someone to hover over me, however, 20 minutes between check-ins is a bit much.   This food and atmosphere will continue to bring me back here. And while I've never had absolutely poor service here, it's a bit frustrating to need something during a meal and not being able to ask for assistance for quite some time. The wait staff always ends up apologizing for not being around; saying they are swamped with tables. This is preventable from the correct actions from management.",

    "text": "Had a belly-filling meal here the other night.  Granted, I still remember going to the Pineville location (like many others), but this one is an exact clone.  Talking to our hostess/seating person, a lot of people from Pineville take the drive out here to get their Texas Roadhouse fix in.  It was a pretty busy Friday night, but we got seated after about 10min of waiting.  I think it was pretty laughable that they have a \"bull pen\" area....  your number gets called up, you get paraded in front of a refrigerated case to pick a possible 16oz steak... and then stand and talk to the hostess for another minute in the bull pen area while they are cleaning off the table.  I guess it takes away the awkward standing and watching people bust their butts to clean the table for you.  Fresh baked rolls with cinnamon butter are presented and promptly eaten.  There is a bucket of peanuts on the table that you can par-take in (as if there isn't enough food in this place).  This particular night, I went with the ribs and they fell off the bone, and were pretty tasty.  As my two sides, I chose the ceasar salad and baked potato.  Ended up waddling out of the place due to two 20oz beers and all the food.  Looking back, I really over ordered... also got a \"baby blossom\" but I have not been that full in a long long time.    Our server was nice and friendly and we didn't have to wait long on the food at all.",
