Although we art not big fans of NY Style pizza, the sauce and cheese had a very good flavor.  We generally like a bit of a crunchier crust that is a bit less chewy.  Now if we could only find a local pizza place that offers Chicago style pizza.  It is good to see another restaurant opening in the year and we definitely like to support the local folks vs just another franchise.   We will definitely try the other menu options (very happy to finally have a place that offers gyros in the area).",

We went to the cash register and placed our order with the \"help\" of an annoyed teen staff member. The place was pretty old and gross but what else do you expect from a  local pizzeria. Regarding the wait time, it didn't impress. We waited an HOUR for a pizza and wings. When the food came, it was hot but lacking a lot of flavor. The sauce and cheese tasted pretty much like nothing. To add to this list of cons, the prices were very expensive. When I'm in the Mount Holly area, I think I'll stick to Marco's pizza.",

It doesn't seem like much as you pull into their parking lot, but you'll be impressed with their pizza for sure!   It's a nice size restaurant with plenty of seating and games available at the tables. You pace your order at the register and they'll bring out your food. I went with a plain cheese pie to determine if indeed their pie is legit and boy was I pleased. A beautiful pie arrived to our table with a wonderful golden crust and white quality mozzarella cheese. The 14\" Large is enough for two hungry people and you might have room for dessert which I didn't ask if they had any.   I would absolutely return to try other items on the menu such as spaghetti & meatballs, chicken parmigiana, calzones, burgers, Philly cheesesteaks etc..",

    "text": "Sorry. Average at best. It's always a red flag when a restaurant tries to do more than they should. Wings and pizza okay, but adding burgers and other sandwiches and appetizers means they'll never be great at one thing. They should have just specialized in Italian food, pizza, or sandwiches. It's too typical of a small town. Anyway, we ordered a variety of things to see if anything stood out. Spaghetti and meatballs, watered down sauce out of a jar and frozen meatballs. Nothing homemade. Cheese pizza, overly chewy crust, too much sauce, not enough cheese. Dominoes quality at best. Meatball Sam-wich, meh. Same frozen meatballs in the spaghetti and too much crusty hard bread, but not terrible. Garlic knots, over cooked, chewy, and just dusted with garlic powder rather than fresh or chopped garlic, and barely any butter. Just dry. Finally, the Italian sandwich. This was probably the best. It was simple, but tasty and the lettuce was crisp, but not good enough to come back. I hate giving bad reviews to small family businesses. But with so much competition, the food must be outstanding. There's nothing at Papa Sammy's that I couldn't make at home.",

    "text": "Papa Sammy's is the real deal. My wife and I stopped in for a late lunch. There was a family of four that came in right after us, but other than that, the place was empty.  First thing I want to comment on is the cleanliness. I don't have super-high expectations when I go into independent, hole-in-the-wall type places like this. Papa Sammy's very pleasantly subverted my expectations. Both the dining area and the part of the kitchen I could see were spotless.  First, we tried some garlic knots. They were excellent. Perfectly baked, crusty on the outside and tender on the inside, with garlic butter and parm. There was a small pool of garlic butter at the bottom of the basket, which for gluttons like myself was a great dipping option.  I got the stromboli, hold the ham and add mushrooms. My wife got the 8\" pizza with pineapple and banana peppers. They came out in a very reasonable amount of time. The stromboli was great, with an excellent ratio of cheese to filling. Shortly after dropping off our food, the cashier girl dropped off a little ramekin of what turned out to be a VERY spicy habanero dipping sauce that I hadn't asked for. Turns out the other table had requested it and it got dropped off at our table by mistake. No harm, no foul; as a lover of all things spicy, I forwent the marinara and instead used that as my dipping sauce. It was fantastic and had me sweating in short order (that's a good thing).  I tried a bite of my wife's pizza and it was tasty, though pineapple and banana peppers are basically the opposite of what I like on my pizza. She enjoyed it very much, and that's what matters.  This place really impressed us. We're moving very close by very soon, and I have no doubt Papa Sammy's will make it into our regular rotation.",
