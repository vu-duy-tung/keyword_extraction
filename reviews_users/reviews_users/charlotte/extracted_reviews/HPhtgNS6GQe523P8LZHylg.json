We'll definitely be back to try some of the others:) the seasoned fries were perfectly crispy and hot. The nachos were covered with tons of cheese. The chicken sandwich was great! No complaints:)",

    "text": "Finally had the chance to check this place out. Overall it was great. I had the bbq chicken sandwich with waffle fries. Chicken was moist and good flavor. The hubs had a chicken sandwich and macaroni and cheese. He like the sandwich the macaroni was ehh. To me when I tried a bite I thought it had an unusual smoky flavor. He took advantage of the beer on tap special and I tried the peach Capri sun. I can't remember the actual name but it was delicious. Good pricing for what you get. Several people around us had the milkshakes and they looked really good as well. Will definitely be back to try one of them. The patio is pup friendly which is a bonus for us!",

The wait was about 45 mins but the hostess gave us frequent updates on how long it would be before we were seated. The seating area is pretty crowded and loud almost to the point that you're yelling over the TVs and band preparing to play. The waitress was nice but the food took a long time to come out and when it did, the nachos were burnt so we had to send that back. I had  the buffalo chicken wrap that was pretty good and my boyfriend ended up having the fish sandwich after the failed attempt at nachos. The food was fresh but once again took a long time to come out. There where times that we needed things at our table and waited 10+ minutes each time before we saw our l waitress. Overall, I wasn't impressed. I'd suggest this place just for drinks and hanging out not for food service.",

The food was cold, devoid of flavor and overpriced. The 'philly' that I ordered was $16 for two halves of medium sized sandwich role. It also was missing the cheese.   The atmosphere is a blend between a bad country music festival and a trashy dive bar.  On the plus side, it's close walking distance to dozens of other much better restaurants.",

Also cheese: seems like they found the cheapest cheese available for sale and they put it on everything. A ton of cheap of cheese on everything!

As far as the food goes, I'd give it a 5 - the fries,fries,fries appetizer was incredibly tasty & it came with 3 different dipping sauces. The crinkle fries tasted delicious. We also ordered the spicy buffalo chicken dip, which was good - nothing crazy.   As far as the service goes, I'd give it a 1. We went at about 3:00 on a Saturday afternoon - it wasn't very busy at all. We could visibly see open tables, but the hostess took over 10 minutes to seat 3 groups of people. It was the most bizarre experience I've ever experienced...it seemed like the hostess was on another planet when you'd ask her a question. Once seated we sat for 10 minutes without a server coming to greet us. I had to go back to the hostess and ask her who our server was.   The atmosphere was OKAY. It looks very clubby. For the evening and nighttime, I think the dim lighting and red lights would be fine, but for 3:00pm in the afternoon, it was so dark and so emo feeling. The atmosphere doesn't quite match the fun/soda shop menu.   I'd love to see something make it in this location, and hope that Rosemont can step up their service and atmosphere to match their fun menu!",

The food, however, leaves much to be desired (maybe they're assuming you'll order enough drinks before you eat to not notice). I ordered a regular cheeseburger and a side of Mac and cheese. The cheeseburger was greasy and overcooked and the Mac and cheese was extremely thick but somehow simultaneously flavorless. The thickness lingers in your mouth as a grease slick long after you've left the restaurant. The buffalo shrimp appetizer had good flavor but the breading falls off as soon as you pick it up with your fork. Food was meh, drinks were good",

I took a date there and after our drinks and apps our server vanished for 30 mins. The only reason she came back was because I asked another server if she could find her. It took roughly another 10 mins for them to track her down, meanwhile there were 7 other servers hanging out near the host stand greeting their friends but no one offered to help. So from out first water and cocktail to our check we sat at a table for 45 min. Once she finally came back she actually asked if we wanted to order anything. I really wish I could say that this was the first time but the service has been an issue since I started going here and it continues to be a hinderance to how amazing this place is. What I find the most interesting is it's always the same, so many servers just hanging out and have no interest in making money unless it's easy. There needs to be more firmer training and supervision in place.",

There's a nice area to sit outside in the front or in the back where there's some shade and inside(where we sat). Walls are decorated with pictures and paintings and a throwback Doctor Who pinball machine. Crowd was mid 20-30s with a couple who even had a baby in a stroller.   The food: My girlfriend and I both got burgers. She got their seasoned fries and I got curly fries. Their burgers are delicious, juicy, greasy everything you'd want. GET THE SEASONED FRIES. The curly fries are good too but definitely choose the crispy seasoned crinkle cut. Only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was their sauces. \"dive sauce\" is okay I'd dip fries in it not on my burger. Gold sauce is just honey mustard. Not to my liking. The only reason this place gets a 4/5 stars is the service. Waitress was nice but only came to the table twice, once to take our order and next to drop it off. She forgot the honey mustard sauce and I had to call her over to ask for it since she never checked in to see how food was etc. She dropped food off at the table right next to us and continued to walk away again before we called her over for the check. Still, she was pleasant whenever she came to the table. We will be back for sure.",

    "text": "The highlight of Rosemont was that adult Capri Sun. It was super packed and they quoted us an hour and a half wait (I suggest making reservations on the weekend) so we just went straight to the bar.  Since we'd already eaten before, I can't comment on the food but the music was trash (I didn't know any of the songs and none of them were urban - I listen to a ton of genres so that says a lot) and the music was extremely loud (hard to hold a conversation).  Lastly, they market it like it's a bar, but it's more so a restaurant since it was hard to find somewhere to stand/chill. I'd go back to try the food and some of their other drinks but on a non-busy night.",

Buffalo dip app and the cheeseburger were great, mac & cheese (oddly) was not good, my Cobb salad would have been great if they hadn't drowned it in ranch. I'm not a \"light dressing\" type and it was way too much, inedibly so. I didn't complain bc I was full from the dip anyway. So for salads I would recommend asking for dressing on the side, as their default is to mix in. Adult \"Capri Sun\" style drinks called Soccer Mom Special were great and refreshing. The birthday milkshake w/ a cupcake on top was delicious- got it virgin- didn't try it with alcohol, as my 10 y/o was the one who ordered it. Picture of the milkshake is inside beside silverware bc we got rained out on the porch, went inside and there was nowhere available to sit (busy).",

I guess I was expecting a little more but I switched it out for buffalo wings which were perfect. The bartender... lol. My friend and I came after work maybe about 5:30 ish and sat in the back. We didn't even know the bartender was back there. No greeting, would you like anything, nada. She was sitting down with her face in her phone. We went inside to inquire on a waiter and when she came out, the bartender stood up. ... We were a little annoyed but okay cool. We ordered a strawberry lemonade which is an adult drink, and the actual name of the drink. We read it exactly as it was worded on the menu. The bartender brings us plain (virgin) strawberry lemonade. Stuff happens! Cool! I get it, I'm still human. Maybe she was confused. I feel like a parent who says \"it wouldn't have happened if you weren't on that phone\" but brushed it off. We tell her the mistake and she offers a shot of vodka. We explained that we wanted the drink how it was described on the menu (it would've been a lot more flavorful and cocktail like vs minute maid strawberry lemonade with vodka.) She says it would've been made the same way. Annoyed, we finished our drinks and wanted another drink. A real cocktail this time. We ordered the drinks and made it know we want the cocktail and not minute maid. She says they ran out of the ingredients to make it. Feeling defeated, we got another concoction and left. More than likely, I won't be back. Also, they need to do something about those aggressive flies if they want people outside in the back. Half the time I was waving flies away.",

Parking is a bit iffy but they are right near the train line so that is a good option. There may be a bit of a wait on weekends but we didn't have to wait too long. The food was average bar food but they do have a really cool fries platter and the real star of the show is those Adult Capri Suns. They will take you down memory lane. The day I went I guess they were out of the branded Rosemont pouches as mine wasn't picture worthy and we got regular drink straws instead of ones you typically get with the soccer mom special aka capri suns. They were tasty and reasonably priced. They also had a band playing that was so loud that we had to yell just to talk to the other members in my party. All in all, I'd probably stop back in when in the area to grab a capri sun.",

My friends and I enjoyed the cheap pitchers of PBR, the fried pickles, and they throughly enjoyed the pouch (adult Capri sun) drinks they serve. I didn't get much chance to explore but it appeared they had an outdoor bar with seating. I did notice a stage and jukebox which tells me it might not be a bad place to cut a rug on the weekend. I look forward to stopping back on a more busy night.",

    "text": "Our visit was off to a not-super-pleasant start for reasons that we will blame on it being a busy Friday night (except for the bathrooms, which needed attention that they didn't get get until a long while after coming to staff attention). The food was a step above typical bar food. Great flavor, huge portions, very fair price. Leaving a review mostly to sing the praises of two of your employees, Erica and Taylor. They easily could have been flustered or rude under the circumstances (like I said, it was busy. It also downpoured and then became even more hectic as everyone outside moved inside.). Instead, they went above and beyond (with a smile!). Have to give credit where credit is due. These employees make your establishment look good!!",

We ended up getting the wings and they were really good. I also got the fries and was excited to know that I could switch out fry choices, not a sweet potato kinda girl.  I'm not a big drinker, so I was sad to know that I couldn't get the adult non alcoholic versions of the soccer mom or the birthday milkshake.   I love the decor. So cliche, ended up taking pictures in the bathroom. The camper bar in the back is pretty awesome.",

    "text": "Ah man, I really don't like doing this, but hopefully this review brings some positive change, because I'd really like to see this spot succeed.   Girlfriend and I went here Friday at around 9pm. Waited 20min for a table (no problem, very busy), waited about that whole time trying to get a drink at the bar (again, okay). We were told we'd be texted, but the cell service in this area is so bad the hostess (very nice) came to get us and seated us and then I got the text.  I ordered a highball to which our waitress asked \"what is it?\" and my girlfriend ordered a vodka soda, which resulted in a whiskey ginger and a vodka tonic.   The menu doesn't offer much - sandwiches, appetizers, and salads, all of the items being those you can find at any bar or pub anywhere. I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich because it was the top sandwich in the menu and I figured \"I guess this is the thing they think is their best.\" No flavor, no heat, just a beige sphere of food that I vaguely remember eating. In comparison one day after work I very shamefully bought a KFC Nashville hot chicken sandwich which was probably 7 or 8 times better than this sandwich. My skinny fries also came out five minutes after my sandwich but these were actually good.   My girlfriend ordered the kale salad but asked for no feta as she can't have dairy. A different girl came back and said they were out of fried cauliflower for the salad to which my gf replied no problem, just no feta because I can't have any dairy. Our waitress then came back three minutes after taking our order and said \"you guys didn't order food did you?\" The salad she got was made with mixed greens (looked like mostly arugula), no kale, and a dairy-based dressing. She took some Lactaid pills and when our waitress went to clean up our table she said \"I didn't even know we had these\" (???).  Look, the place is busy, so it looks like they'll be fine, but it doesn't make much sense. They don't have enough space to be a party bar/club - even though a bunch of pastel button-down dudes yelled \"oooohhh!!!\" When the very loud DJ mix transitioned from Tearin' Up My Heart to Zedd's \"Why don't you just Malcolm in the Middle\" - but they don't have good enough food to be a food place worth anything in Charlotte. I didn't get their gimmick stuff that's supposed to set them apart (their Adult Capri Sun or alcoholic milkshakes, which, i don't know man, don't seem overwhelmingly appealing) so maybe I'm missing the point, but I rarely have bad meals in Charlotte, and this was probably the worst. If you want a positive, the well-drinks are $3 on Fridays, so",

It didn't taste like bacon salty, but like someone just sprinkled a bunch of salt randomly on the chicken. The \"seasoned fries\" were a big no. They are small crinkle cut with no seasoning . I would try the waffle fries the next time. For dessert, I tried the skillet cookie. Also another unimpressive item, it needed more ice cream and less cooking time. Overall, the experience was okay. The band is LOUD. Not a first date experience or if you just want to enjoy your company. I would come back. They have good weekly specials. I don't know if I would eat here though.",

    "text": "I believe my ears are still ringing due to the incredibly loud live music that was played in-house on Friday night.  Rosemont is a place that caters to the just-graduated-and-got-my-first-adult-job-but-I-want-to-feel-like-I'm-still-in-college-crowd. As mentioned in other reviews, Rosemont has taken over Wu's (and before that, Nan & Byron's) old spot and the parking situation is TOUGH. There's no getting around it, there's a chance you may luck up with a front spot but just be prepared.  I arrived on a Friday around 6:30 and was immediately asked for my ID before I even touched the front door. Turning this place into a club atmosphere so early in the evening! When I walked in, I was greeted by a couple of different hostesses who seemed very frazzled because they couldn't find what they needed to take down people's names. I told one of the girls that I was a part of a party of three. However, due to the music, she thought I said five and quoted a wait time of 30 minutes. I shouted to reiterate that I had a party of three and she took down my number. About 10 minutes later, my name was called to come in for seating.  We were seated off to the right side in the second room. I noticed that they have added front and back patios which is a nice touch. Our waitress came over and took our drink orders. She was very sweet although she didn't seem to be that well-versed on the menu items (I will give her pass on that since the place is still pretty new). For a drink, I went with the Rosemont mule. I wanted to try the soccer mom special (aka the adult capri suns seen all over the 'gram) but I feared it was just too sweet for my taste. We all then placed our orders and I went with the blackened fish sandwich with seasoned fries.  While we waited, we had to literally shout our conversations. This is just not something I find enjoyable when dining out. The mule was just okay. At first, I thought it was going to be really good but, after more sips, it tasted quite watered down. I could barely taste any ginger. On the flip side, the prices for their cocktails and alcoholic beverages are very reasonable so you're paying for exactly what you get.  The food? BLAAAAAH. My blackened fish sandwich did not come with any tomatoes (even though they are listed in the menu description) and the seasoning didn't really add anything. The cilantro lime dressing that came on my sandwich was much more overpowering than the actual seasoning. The gold sauce that was served with the fries was much better. Also, the fries did not have one ounce of seasoning. They're just brown, crinkly fries, quite frankly. As my friend Kia T mentioned, they probably came from a frozen bag found at the grocery store.  Rosemont is not any place I would recommend for food. Go there to drink and people watch. However, if you actually want to talk to the person(s) you came with, go much earlier in the day before 5 p.m.",

I visited Rosemont twice during opening weekend and the service was great both times. The servers are very attentive and it seems like the management has the right idea to take the space to the next level. This location as been a few different establishments over the last few years. Rosemont seems to be on the right track the breaking the bad streak.  For starts, get the soccer mom special. Peach Ring is the move...perfectly refreshing on a hot summer day. Enjoy your beverage of either of the outdoor patios which are both perfectly situated with a bar in back, front and inside.   I highly recommend the wings. There are few places that you can go where wings are prepared properly. Rosemont wings are double fried, providing the perfect amount of crispness with a great selection of sauces. Speaking of sauces, Rosemont offers 6+ sauces that pair well with fries and such. I love the habanero bacon and the curry ketchup.   If you're looking for a great hangout spot with options and variety of daily special and live music weekly...Rosemont is an option!",

A group of girls had the adult Capri suns I came for and they vouched that they were delicious. The peach one has whiskey and the grape or \"transfusion\" has vodka.   I'm not a whiskey person so I got the grape and it was pretty good. Tastes just like juice. THE PEACH ONE IS AMAZING. At only $6 this is a steal. The pouch is so cool and perfect for navigating a crowd with ease and no spillage. That's really all you need to know tbh but I'll give you a little more.  The atmosphere is chill. They've got some TVs, the nba finals was on. They played s variety of music throughout the night, Carrie Underwood, Cardi B etc. The food comes out relatively quickly. The bacon cheeseburger was delicious.. the waffle fries were undercooked. The chicken sandwich was also good and the sweet potato fries were a hit. The giant milkshakes looked great and so did a salad I saw. The reception here is bad and the lighting is not ideal for selfies but I will DEFINITELY be back here.",

My only criticism is that I feel like Rosemont is having an identity crisis--the aesthetics of the interior are dark and moody, think black and red and neon lights...very cool. The music was loud country music for a large portion of the time we were there, confusing. The menu is all over the place with what the offer, not necessarily a bad thing.  Other than not fully understanding the \"vibe\" the food was really great. We had a group of 6 at lunch time, we were sat immediately and the service was friendly and attentive. Absolutely no complaints. We ordered a couple of salads, two burgers, a chicken sandwich and an order of sheet pan nachos. All of the food came out in a timely manner, and at the same time--which is always appreciated! The star was absolutely the nachos, they were awesome and the serving size is HUGE.  The skinny fries were shoestring perfectly salted and served hot, I love that they offer so many different sauces for dipping etc. I'm a big fan of condiments so this was fun for me.   This is worth checking out--I'd love to go back and try one of their signature items like the adult capri sun, or the birthday milkshake (alcoholic!).",

A suggestion would be to Tone it down in volume of the music ,because not only were we complaining about the noise but so we're the people next to us. Rosemont has u excited from the outside with the big sign on the building saying liquor bar!! Kind of leaves you in suspense until you actually go inside .The tone in the inside was gloomy due to the dark lighting but was very well a bar setting . Well what can I say they sale exactly what I thought they would bar food! Nothing more nothing less is what you get here with Rosemont. We all enjoyed our adult Capri suns. On my next visit I wouldn't mind coming back to try one of the famous milkshakes they offer.",

    "text": "My experience at Rosemont was just that, an experience. My wife and I swung through around 6:30 on a Friday night and grabbed a couple spots at the bar. I was surprised when we walked in that they already had a live band cranked up! They were playing a good mix of newer rock songs and classic rock.   Apparently Rosemont is known for their adult Capri Suns, but we decided to split a boozy milkshake. I'm not really sure how much, if any, booze was in said milkshake. Maybe they just do a really good job of masking the taste, or maybe there's just not much booze in there. I don't know. We also got some cheesy bacon fries which were very good.  There was a moment where another customer had ordered a couple of drinks and got into somewhat of a heated argument with the bartender. The woman had ordered a boozy milkshake like ours and I guess expected it to be ready faster than it was. The bartender let her know that it takes a while to make them, to which the woman replied that she wouldn't have ordered it if she had known it took so long. She finally got her drink and left and all the bartenders started talking crap about the woman. I know it's not always easy dealing with the public, but don't talk junk about other customers where your current customers can hear. Pretty unprofessional.  I would like to go back to Rosemont for a more thorough \"review\" of the menu, but I think I'll give it some time to let the novelty wear off.",

    "text": "I rarely give lower than 3 stars, but I had an interesting experience at Rosemont. I've been wanting to check this place out since I heard about the adult capri sun concept, so my boodle and I went on Friday after work to give it a try. We grabbed a parking spot in their small, tiny lot out front. SCORE!  We walked in where the hostess did not greet us. We said hello and asked if there were any tables outside. Her response was just, \"No.\" So I stood there wondering if there was a wait, if we could get on a list, I thought maybe she would offer to seat us inside... nothing. So we told her we'd grab a seat at the bar. She looked around and we walked away. Very bizarre.  We sat down at the bar. The space inside is really well decorated and very trendy. A bartender immediately greeted us and gave us menus. They were busy... pouches after pouches of beverages were flying out from behind the bar into the hands of thirsty customers. They have really cute, neon plastic curly straws. But this place is an environmental nightmare. I cannot imagine how much plastic they throw away daily.  We ordered a boozy milkshake and the bacon cheese fries appetizer. Fries were hot, cheesy, and delicious. Milkshake was yummy and boozy. No complaints on food or drink.  We did witness an interesting interaction between a customer and two of the bartenders. The customer ordered a milkshake and closed her tab. She had waiting about a minute or two for the shake, and then politely asked the bartender about it. The bartender said, \"It takes about 10 minutes to make a milkshake, but it's okay.\" The customer indicated that if she had known it would take 10 minutes to make a milkshake, she would have ordered a different drink. They went back and forth, the bartender being a pretty rude. Within 30-45 seconds, the milkshake was ready and the customer was on her way. The bartenders then proceeded to talk badly about the customer and I could hear every word. It was a little off-putting.   All this to say, I would like to go back to Rosemont. I think they were new and working out some kinks. I think the concept is cool, but I wish it was more environmentally friendly. I hope ongoing staff training and development will help them leave a more positive impression on patrons.",

The mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy. I loved that the chicken was breaded to add more texture and the buffalo sauce added a little kick. Would definitely recommend. My friend got the salmon sandwich and a cucumber salad on the side. She said the salmon was cooked really well and the cucumber side salad was a great portion and very fresh tasting.

I ordered the peach ring drink and it was simply amazing. It came in a Capri sun looking pouch and was sweet and strong. We had a party of 6 and was able to sit next to the garage door looking window facing the patio. It took awhile to order food. I think they may have been short staff because to do anything took a long time (Ex. To be seated. To be greeted, to order drinks, to get food etc.) Once my food arrived, the Mac and cheese burger I ordered along with the fries were a little cold. I was disappointed in the Mac and cheese burger. It could have used more seasoning and a little more of the Mac and cheese flavor. I could not taste the Mac and cheese at all which is surprising because one of my coworkers who was sitting across from me said the Mac and cheese was really good.  I'll definitely return to this restaurant to give them another shot. The food was not terrible, I just expected it to be a little more appealing to my tastebuds.",

Greeting a customer is one of the most important things in business. ANYWAYS.   The food was good, nothing special or maybe I still had a bad taste in my mouth from the greeting. Who knows.....  The food is cheap though, so that's awesome. All in all...... probably won't be back, too many amazing places in Southend to pick over this one.",

Jacob, the manager was polite and apologetic...he refunded me for the milkshake we didn't drink and offered us another one and said maybe it was made wrong and he'd make us one correctly. We declined the generous offer and left but the way he handled it was very professional and he is definitely a good representative of the company...unfortunately we won't be returning but for anyone reading maybe it's worth a try for the food? We were gonna order curly fries but they ran out of that too.",

Service was very friendly and pretty fast too. They are flexible with table space which works well for a happy hour. The patio space that's covered with the garage door open is a nice way to get a breeze without sitting in the sun.   Appetizers are half price from 4-6, so we got an order of fries, fries, fries. It comes with waffle, sweet potato, and curly fries. While they were all good, the curly fries were definitely the best. We tried the jalepeno bacon, cilantro lime, and Thai ranch dipping sauces. The jalepeno bacon and Thai ranch were good, but the cilantro lime was a little watery and not great for fries.   I also tried some of the fried pickles and buffalo cauliflower that other people got. The buffalo cauliflower was quite good.   This is a great place to stop for a drink in South End.",

    "text": "Well changing the name didn't really change much about the food and service; it's still not good.   A group of friends and I stopped in for dinner and drinks on a Sunday. It's still more bar than restaurant and not much of the interior has changed since the last restaurant. The service was slow and the server seemed confused. Two people ordered wraps with spinach tortillas. The server returned and only asked one person if it was okay to swap it out since no spinach tortillas were available. The food came out fairly quickly but not everyone was served at the same time; who doesn't love that awkward moment of staring at their food while they wait for others to be served!   I had a chicken sandwich which was fine, nothing special and nothing to return for. The wraps were approved by the two receiving them. The guys both ordered Mac and cheese; both said it was dry.   Dessert was then ordered and it was a monster milkshake thing. As we all took a taste the photogenic dessert, we realize it should have been left for photos. Between the Food Lion grade cupcake and piles of sprinkles someone almost choked on, it is just.... pretty. Bless.   As the DJ started to blare.... not in a good way.... we waited and waited for our checks. We had to ask multiple servers before we finally were released from the painfully loud music that completely stopped all conversation.   The place needs to just start over. Changing the name alone just isn't going to cut it. The bathrooms are still frightful and the heavily painted wood table and chairs just feels dirty. The food isn't special and the service still bad. Maybe the next rendition will get it right.",

I got a Cobb salad here and it was good but not amazing. I only had one egg and too much turkey. I would have preferred an even balance. I also would like romaine or iceberg lettuce. I would probably get it again but mostly because I cannot eat half the menu due to my food allergies  For drinks, they have these soccer mom specials but I've seen them make them, and it doesn't look like a lot of alcohol and a bunch of sugar. On the beer front, there is absolutely no options for people who like sours and goses. For being in Charlotte with a ton of options to craft beer, I was extremely disappointed.",

I waited an hour from the time I sat down until my food came out. I had wings. Our server gave tons of attention to her 7 top. I counted at least 5 mimosas headed over there when I had to ask for my empty glass to be refilled for the 1st time.   My bf ordered steak fries and they came out crinkle. If you dont have what was ordered, let us know when ordering. It feel insulting when you try to coax us they are one in the same.   When we mention it to our server, she immediately throws up bringing over the manager. Several times. I declined. I dont need a free meal. I hate when that's assumed that is what I want.  Surprisingly, my bf wanted to speak to a manager after he continued to watch our server  take care of her other table and still forgot to bring what I asked for. BTW, I never got it.   He spoke to the manager and she listened. There was no apology until I pointed out that no one has yet to give one. She asked what could she do to make up for it. I told her its nothing that she could do except what she was doing by listening and give some coaching to that server. We declined free food when it was offered again.   We never saw our server again. No one asked us if we wanted to order anything else. The check was dropped off with a $15 gift card to return. The manager insisted we take it.   My bf and I both agree that the food is good. Hopefully service will allow me to give a review like I've done in the past.",

A few friends and I went one night for dinner, and parking was a nightmare. There weren't a ton of people there, but somehow there was one compact car spot.   Inside, there was a live band and they were LOUD. We weren't there very late, maybe 8 or so, but we could barely have a conversation. We ate our food basically without speaking because there was no point! I'm sure it's not always like that, though.  I ordered an Oreo milkshake that literally had whole Oreo cookies in it and was really, really good. Everyone's food was just okay - nothing spectacular. The menu is American style and we all got burgers, wrap, and sandwiches. Not the best, not the worst. It wouldn't be my first choice, but I wouldn't say no to trying it again.",

Food: 3/5 I had the Mac n cheese burger.. 2 patties with a layer of mac and cheese. It was ok.. not much seasoning to the burger nor the man n cheese.. I only ate half.. waffle fries were good.   Ambiance: music was loud during lunch time. Wasn't that much people in there so it was hard to hear my friend..   Overall, lunch time is out.. I would come back when I want to watch a game or try the out door bar..",

    "text": "I work right down the street and drive by here on my every day commute. I've moved to Charlotte 2 years ago and I've seen this place change from something to Wu's and now Rosemont. My co-workers (working in this office for a decade and a half) always noted that it was a \"revolving door\" before they could even try the new tenant assuming it's a \"cursed\" spot. I always thought it was weird comment to make and sought to make an opinion for myself. I mean - yes it took me 2 years and a restaurant change, but I made plans with a friend to give this place a try for lunch. Why lunch? I live on the edge of town, so I'm literally only in this area during work hours.  Atmosphere - This place has a very trendy, eclectic feel, hodgepodge of fun decor, \"old-school\" marquee that spells Rosemont above the bar, lots of TVs to show sports. I did notice the sound was quite loud. It was not very crowded inside, so maybe that made the sound of the TVs seem loud. I had to talk a little louder to my friend across the table. Maybe for lunch they can tune down the volume and turn it up for night time crowd. I was not ready for sloppy bar convo talk tone....if you know what I mean.  Food - I was between the Rosemont Special Burger and the Prim Rib Dip. I asked which the server recommended and she said that the Rosemont Burger was what they were known for. I got the curly fries as my side and I couldn't decide on one sauce, so I chose 4. Our server said that it's not additional charge, so I tried their Gold Sauce, Dive Sauce, Thai Chili and Yum Yum. The Gold Sauce was my favorite, it paired well to the seasoning on the fries. The Rosemont Burger reminded me of a sloppy joe with the onions, chili and cheese..and mustard. I love mustard. I really enjoyed the burger and the fries.   Staff - when walking in, my party was already seated as I was a little late, and they knew I was \"with\" another party before I was finished saying that I was looking for a friend. I was impressed by the hostess' attention to that. She led me to the correct table with my friend. Our server and trainee took our orders quickly and made some good sauce recommendations. It took a while for our server to refill a drink after asking twice, same with the check and taking our payments. I mean it wasn't not packed and there were a few servers upfront, so it didn't seem understaffed, which I would have taken into consideration.  Location - as I said, I went there during lunch and making a left turn on south boulevard is a nightmare. Wow, people have not courtesy and block the entrance while they inch towards the light at east blvd. My friend went around, just to be able to make a right into the lot. What a nightmare. Ample enough of parking - not sure what it's like night time. I assume most patrons walk, with their location near the East/West stop on the light rail or the many apart complexes now popping up in the neighborhood.  Food 4 Atmosphere/Location 3 Service 2  Overall a 3, I think this will be a nice sports bar, dinner time hang-out that leads to a few after hour drinks spot. For lunch it is more of a \"meh\". Let's see if this place lasts and the \"revolving door curse\" is just a phantom of my coworker's imagination.......Also, they have a patio!",

I don't mind paying for a good drink as long as the bartenders make it worth your while! We had a few appetizers, nothing was to write home about but it was good.  Everything was clean and cute. Nice atmosphere to chill with a group of friends. We didn't have anything negative to say about this and we will definitely be returning.  I did love the fact that this was a hop, skip and a jump away from the lift rail. That is something I look for when we are planning to go out and drink. It also close enough to other awesome spots so you can hop around.  I loved the seating on the outside, we didn't get a chance to sit at a table but next time it's a must. It's a nice set up outside.  See you soon Rosemont!",

There wasn't anything wrong with it, but I was hoping for bar food, and there are some options (wings, fries) but not what I was looking for.   We started with the calamari, which I don't recommend. It was very rubbery and just tasted freezer burnt, and they were very oily. Additionally, the portion size didn't justify the price point. I ordered the wedge salad, which was loaded with bacon and blue cheese. My bacon was overdone, but the blue cheese on the salad was delicious. My husband ordered the wings and liked the spice level of the buffalo sauce. They were a mixed basket of some meaty wings and some skimpy wings, so here were some inconsistencies there.   We also came mid-day and the music was extremely loud for a rainy Saturday afternoon. There was college football on, and I think one of the TVs had the commentary on, but it was hard to hear (or there was feedback if the tv volume wasn't on) so that was slightly bizarre. As I said, I bet it's a great bar scene at night, but I'm not sure about the mid-day lunch.",

I would have loved to have heard more from them!   Anyway, we put our name in for a table of 6 as soon as we got there. An hour and a half later and after many visits to the hostess stand we got a table outside. By then our waitress told us the kitchen was on \"pause\". I was so confused. Could we not order food? Were they backed up by 30 minutes or 40?  We wanted the Fries Fries Fires asap. We were getting hangry! Finally we got them, I loved the size of this appetizer and most of the dipping sauces.  I got the chopped kale salad for my entree. I didn't see kale in the salad at all, it looked like a spring mix. The homemade bacon jalapeno dressing was so hot (I even asked a few girls to try it to see if I was being a baby or not). I also said the waitress about it, she said yeah it's hot. A pre-warning would I have been helpful. I like hot things, but not where you need to take a drink of water after every bite.   Overall, not a late late spot to eat yet. I would come back for drinks and food earlier. I loved the outside patio on the back and the new airstream beer station is amazing.",

    "text": "After readingsome of the mixed reviews, I still wanted to give Rosemont a chance. I was hoping that this place would surmount th curse of this location and the Bottle Cap Group would have a winner with this location. Sadly, I was disappointed.   Let's start with the positives. Their drink menu is great and reasonably priced. And their food prices are reasonable as well. I like how they added the front and rear patios to have outside seating. Our service was good an our server did the best she could despite the loud music.   Now on to the not so good news. The parking at this location has always been horrible-it's awkward, tight and not a lot of spaces, so beware. On Friday night's, they have live music. The band was pretty good but it was incredibly loud in there. It was so loud that I couldn't even hear my friend sitting next to me and trying to have conversation with my friend on the other side of the table was out of the question. We had to yell our order to our server. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with a side of te he seasoned fries. The burger came as two small stacked patties with two pieces of bacon. The burger patties weren't seasoned and didnt have any flavor. Th seasoned fries weren't seasoned at all. You can tell that they're the frozen fries that have the seasoning in the batter. The fries weren't cooked all the way through and they just didnt taste good.  Overall I'm giving it 2 stars because of the food, it just wasn't stellar. If I come back, it'll solely be for the \"liquor bar\" drinks and it wont be on a Friday night, I could barely hear and have a conversation with the loud music.",

It then took twenty more minutes to get the waitress to come to our table and then they brought our food order out twice so I guess that's why it takes so long.  Also witnessed a waitress get fired and then try to fight customers and staff so at least there was entertainment while I waited a ridiculously long time.",

The bartender handed us the menu with no real greeting or introduction of the awesome drinks and cool features you have to offer. No smile. No excitement. How can i be excited when your staff isn't? The other bartender chatted up with people who worked for the company instead of the customers. I want bartenders who get it. We were prepared to blow money, but the service was so mediocre. I ordered the peel and eat shrimp which was over cooked. I asked for lemons which she grabbed with her hands...hands all over my lemons. Have you ever even handled food before? She seemed to not know much at all about anything, or at least didn't express it. I received no wet naps or anything to clean my hands. At this point in the game Charlotte has numerous bars/restaurants so work on standing out aside from a \"new concept\". It takes more than a new concept to make an impact. It's the team you hire. It seems like this is always an area of opportunity for this place.",

    "text": "This is my third time going to the restaurant and it seems they are very lost when getting orders out in a timely manner. The first time we went they had so many servers no body know who had what. (Try assigning sections) the second time we went the server said oh I'm sorry we are out of that and next thing we knew another server was brining it to our table. Tonight I went for my partners bday with a small group of 5 people and it was awful. We waited about 20 minutes before she came to actually take our food order then all of food came out except to salmon salads and the server says oh they will be out in a few minutes. So at this point three of us are holding off on eating because we didn't want to be rude however after 15 minutes past the \"bar manager\" come to apologize and say they don't even have the salad to begin with they ran out. How is this possible after waiting a total of 30+ minutes no one came to say something sooner. Then after frustration the bday boy just says he doesn't want anything because we would hav to wait longer and then he would have to eat. This was a horrible experience one that I can't say I'd return for.  But it continues...so I tell our server please bring the check and explained how to split the bill so of course she brings them back wrong and gives the bday boy a check when I clearly said I was paying for him so no biggie I guess I'll just put both receipts on my clipboard. However then she brings the bills back and she mixed the cards up so the other couple actually paid for the wrong food and I paid for there's. Is it really that complicated to just swipe a card.  So if you want fast efficient service I would avoid at all cost. I do have to give them credit on the food though if and when you actually get it the taste is great.",

In their defense, it's a new spot and we were there Friday night at 730, but the less than mediocre tasting food couldn't even salvage the terrible service we received. We were told there was an hour and a half wait for a table for 2 so we gladly sat at the bar thinking we'd have an appetizer and a few drinks then move to a table later but we never got a call (not even after we left), which is inexcusable in my opinion. We ordered the \"Fries, Fries, Fries\" appetizer with extra sauces to try, and the super basic basket of fries came an hour later with no extra sauces. We could barely get someone's attention to order a drink despite being at the bar so requesting our forgotten sauces was a lost cause, obviously. After 2 hours and many desperate attempts to keep our glasses full we decided to order food to go, which was a joke. It took another 45 minutes to get our food and the food itself was abysmal. We ordered the bacon cheeseburger with the mac and cheese and an extra side of pasta salad and it was barely edible. I had high hopes but unfortunately Rosemont just didn't deliver.",

We were celebrating, so we were eager to try out the milkshakes that have been all over social media, but first we had drinks, apps, and our meal. Our experience started out fine. The service was kind of slow (15 minutes to get drinks and forgot to put in our appetizer) and half of our group had ordered the Mahi sandwich, which they were apparently out of, which was disappointing. but overall all the drinks were extremely tasty and the food was pretty good (although the calamari and waffle fries could have been fried longer). Our favorite was the dive sauce and sweet potato fries. Then we ordered a round of the XXX Milkshakes (what we had originally came here for). Apparently it was \"Media Day\" and these bloggers or whatnot started showing up right after we placed our order, which apparently means that everyone dropped everything to cater to them while they wandered around taking photos of everything. Our table was right next to their section of tables, so we got to watch while they got food, drinks, more food and more drinks, while 30 minutes after placing our order, we still had nothing and hadn't seen our server in that long either. By this point, we had been there more than 2 hours and eventually I went to the hostess stand to cancel our order and just get the check. When our waitress finally came over, her excuse was \"they didn't have a milkshake maker in house that day\".....Isn't that what you're trying to be known for?  We were extremely disappointed and for a celebration dinner, it was very anticlimactic and did not end on a good note.",

I checked the reviews for recommended items, and chose the bacon cheeseburger. Needless to say, it did not disappoint. The burger was juicy and flavorful, and the toasted bun was tasty as well. Other people at the table got it as well, and had similar reviews. The seasoned fries were also on point, along with the sauce they provided which is akin to mayo/ketchup mixture and provides a great option to dip fries in as well as add to your burger if you choose. I chose to drink water, but the other folks said that the drinks were worth it. The waitress was very attentive, and not overbearing. It was overall a great experience, and would definitely recommend it. I hope it beats the odds of that location unlike the previous 2 tenants, and with the food quality, I see no reason it can't last long.",

It took us 30 minutes to be seated which was understandable since they were packed.  The food was great!  I order medium wings and I loved them.  My friends ordered sweet potato fries, a side salad, and macaroni and cheese.  They absolutely loved their food as well.  The staff was very nice.  There were very sweet ladies that walked to each table to collect plates when the waitress was busy.  Our waitress, Morgan, was so sweet, helpful, and knowledgeable.  The drinks.... were simply AMAZING!  I ordered the peach drink that comes in a pouch similar to a capri sun and I loved it.  I ordered a total of three that night lol.  Parking was a little difficult but the bar is located in South End, the food and drinks are amazing, and they're usually busy so I wasn't surprised nor did I mind waiting.  I'll definitely be returning to Rosemont on a regular basis.  For those complaining about the wait time.. you can't blame the bar for having great food and a comfortable environment.  No one wants to leave! :)",

Nothing really made poorly, but all of this can be found done better at many restaurants all over Charlotte. Trying to be an upscale version of the late, lamented Penguin may not be the best idea. Then again, maybe this area needs something basic and average. Not sure. But any menu as unimaginative as this is going to suffer as long as the gas station across the street has better food. It did when Wu's was there and it still does now. My advice? Eat at the gas station.",

The lettuce in the salad looked like it had been sitting in dressing for hours. The wings were decent.        I can not explain how bad our server was. I won't put her name on here but our experience started with waters that tasted way to chlorinated.  We asked for new ones from the soda machine as that water would be filtered. We were told it was, but she brought new ones and amazingly they tasted much better.  Our drinks were empty for most of our meal. One person would get ask for a drink and before anyone could say anything to her about other drinks she turned away and disappeared.  Literally we were never asked if we wanted a refill, we had to ask ourselves.  Having been a server myself I feel like waiting tables 101 is to ask if everyone else is ok before walking away.        Overall the dining experience tonight will forever put this place off my radar for food or drinks. Hopefully they get their POS system fixed as well cause the charge is to a place called WU's which I didn't eat at.",

With any luck, they can sell this prime location to a serious owner and management staff in the near future.  We went here as a group of 4 on a Friday night and waited 30 minutes for an open table (no big deal). We received a text that our table was ready and we went back to the front.   The hostess was too busy taking care of a drunk waitress that was in the process of trying to fight her boyfriend. We waited an additional 10 minutes before we were able to flag down the hostess. We were then seated and waited another 15 minutes for a waitress to show up. Following the trend, drinks took another 15 minutes, and our appetizers took another 20. The staff then brought out our order again, accidentally doubling our order.  Meanwhile, the drunk waitress was screaming at her boyfriend and multiple patrons while the manager and bouncer scratch their heads and wonder what to do. She eventually gets kicked out but continues to walk back in and start a fight. This happens a few more times. Eventually half of the bar is watching this unfold and neither the bouncer nor manager give a damn.   This place has a ton of potential, but the terrible service, poor management, and overall disregard for their image is embarrassing.  I would rather suggest McDonalds or Waffle House to anyone who asked.",

We get there, hour wait for our table which is fine, so we head to the back bar. The outside bar is manned by only two people, so the line accumulates very quickly. They ended up losing my friend's credit card, finally realizing that after a 15 minute search holding up the entire line. Average time to get a drink/close a tab was probably 30 minutes for this bar.   The worst part is when I went to check on our table status after about an hour. I spoke to the hostess who told me that no tables were being sat until the owners table (of probably 30-40 people, little league team party) got their food. We are waiting as 4-5 tables sit empty so the owners of the place can get their service before their patrons. I guess this place will follow the success of Wu's.",

    "text": "A group of us went to the Rosemont on the first night of its opening. We showed up at 5 so had a table inside (thankfully since it rained). In my experience with new restaurants in Charlotte, they usually struggle with the first night. . .not Rosemont. They nailed it. We had an incredible waitress, Lexi. She was very attentive, checked in on us at the right times, made sure our drinks were never empty - awesome service! The food was really good too. We had the fries and shrimp snack - so good - and then I had the salad with Mahi. The atmosphere of the restaurant was really neat and the band was strong. My one and biggest complaint is the band was so loud we couldn't talk to each other. I would highly recommend the band start after dinner hours. We were literally screaming at each other. Look forward to enjoying this neighborhood joint more!",

The hostess left her stand when we walked in and came back 5 min later and then greeted us. I went thru half my meal without my drink then we ran out of water and ranch. We went through our whole meal without plates for our shared dishes. They also left people's empty plates on surrounding tables just looked sloppy.",

    "text": "Don't waste your time. Or money. My first visit this evening and it was ABSOLUTE TRASH. I got there and despite the fact that there were 7 or 8 servers/hosts at the front, NO ONE acknowledged me for more than 5 minutes. I should have left, but against my better judgment I stayed. Fast forward to ordering. I ordered my food and wanted to add a side of shrimp for $5. I was told I could not and that I had to order the shrimp entree. So, I did. I shouldn't have. The shrimp were overcooked and salty as all get out! I told my server and she still charged me for them!! The waffle fries sucked. They were so bland and soggy. They tasted old. I didn't eat those either. And let's talk about the band. They were so loud that I couldn't hear and my friend and I couldn't even chat together. Basically, if you want good food, great service, and a nice atmosphere, this place isn't it. I definitely won't be back. This place is TRASH!!",

    "text": "We came on a Friday night less than a month after opening so we knew it would be packed. We waited 20 min at the bar for a drink while our table was getting ready. We got the drinks and went to the patio and chilled for another 15 and then someone called us over saying our table was ready (we were supposed to get a text alert). 10 min after being seated the text alert came through. We ordered some more drinks, the waitress didn't know what a Highball was so we had to explain it to her. She brought back a whiskey and ginger (wrong), but my bf took it. She brought a vodka tonic when I ordered a vodka soda. We ordered food and the waitress didn't write it down. Someone came up to me 15 min after and said they were out of the fried cauliflower for my salad. Then the waitress who took our order came over and said \"you guys didn't order food, did you?\" And I said \"uh, yeah...someone just came and told me you're out of the cauliflower.\" And she said \"oh, okay!\" Lol so we get the food and it's alright...bfs fries came 5 min late and my salad (which was supposed to be kale but was definitely arugula) had a dairy dressing when I said hold the feta bc I'm lactose intolerant. I took 6 lactaid pills bc I was starving and needed to eat! The waitress came back and scooped up my lactaid pill wrappers after I finished and said \"I didn't even know we had these!\" Lolol so...we prob won't come back. The signature cocktails were good so I'll give it a star.",

I want to return and try one of those adult Capri Sun drinks and the birthday cake milkshake. I definitely recommend this place. The atmosphere and music was very nice for a lunch,  so I can only image the atmosphere at night.  The servers were very nice and helpful. They have a live band sometimes on the weekend.
