I'm a gal on the go and often do not have time to buy groceries and meal prep myself so this place is great. The pricing is great too per meal. I spent less per meal than when I would be busy at work and going through drive-throughs (and not to mention, so much better for you) Thanks CleanEatz, can't wait for my next order!",

Nonetheless, I tried to honey mustard chicken panini and it outstanding. So delicious and the chicken is juicy. I was a little taken aback by the pricing, but it was totally worth it. The portion size was good. I also had the side salad. It was a pretty bland it was just lettuce and carrots but the sweet chili dressing was amazing. There's definitely room for some improvements but the food overall was tasty , plus there is a demand for clean and healthy eating.",

I had never been there before and  was looking to the girl at the counter for some suggestions. She stated she was  new there and she doesn't eat food like that anyway. Um....Wow....ok.....after taking forever to decide, I ordered the   Wasabi Crab wrap with side salad. It had Had absolutely NO Wasabi on it. I was also missing a dressing I had ordered. I had ordered ranch and balsamic vinaigrette. The ranch was absolutely terrible and they both tasted like they had come premade. I let the girl know my wrap was very bland and that it was missing the Wasabi.  Instead of offering  to take it back and fix it the way it supposed to be prepared, she left me with my wrap to talk to the guy in the kitchen. I was informed all they had was wasabi powder and it was very hot. Um....ok?! I ordered the WASABI Crab. I Was asked if she could bring me some. Never offered to have prepared properly. I was brought a ramikin full of prepared Wasabi Powder. So at the table I had to unfold half my wrap, Try to incorporate a wasabi paste that was supposed to be a drizzle onto the bland crab and unsuccessfully re-roll my wrap. Very very disappointed. Not once did the manager ever come over to apologize or do anything to make it right.  I also ordered the healthy nachos. They were good except for the fact that Everytime I would cut a piece of sweet potato fries the paper in the basket would tear and I was fishing paper off my fork before I could eat.   All in all I doubt I'll be back and I was very dissatisfied with my visit. The concept is great, the execution needs some serious work.",

I opted for no sauce, paid, and walked away.  The woman behind me had to get my attention and tell me that I was given a number and a drink with my order...Mr. Personality never spoke up.

If you're a gym rat in need of a quick, easy meal, this could work for ya. If you're traveling and looking for a Vegetarian or Vegan option, you can build that here. But there is nothing particularly clean about the food sourced from a US Foods truck (per the chef). When I inquired about the sourcing of their meats, it was like deer in headlights....like they never heard the terms grass fed, pasture raised, antibiotic free. The response was minimally processed with little sodium....(I hope so!) You won't find organic options, and you'll find better looking salad greens at the Harris Teeter salad bar. The place was clean, despite the 3 girls at the front counter being overly attentive to their phones and lip gloss. And everyone was nice enough. The food I received was cooked to a good texture: broccoli and beans were not overcooked, i.e. \"Clean\" is a bit of a farce, although a step up from most people's everyday American diet.",

Chopped chicken was extremely dry with bone pieces throughout.  Sauces were lame.  Music so loud and annoying, made you want out as fast as possible.  I saw they were out of forks and told an employee, he said \"sorry dude, they're all dirty\" and never brought more (I used a spoon).  Tables are cheap, thin aluminum ones that scoot every time you touch them.  Place reminds you of a class project gone wrong.",

I am not particularly a fan of healthy eating, but the meals I have ordered so far just taste like great food. I work over 40 hours a week and finding time to do my own meal prep just wasn't happening for me, Clean Eatz has been a life saver. I come home, throw it in the microwave and in a few minutes I have an amazing, tasty, well balanced dinner. No drive thrus, no stress about what I'm making for dinner. The hardest part is picking which meal I want to try next. I will be ordering again next week, and the week after that. If you are looking to eat better, or simply tired of grabbing a bad option because it's all you have time for, or if you simply love great food, give clean eatz a try. You will be so happy that you did.",

I figured you can't go wrong with veggies, but I was wrong. a few hours later I ended up with an upset stomach and threw up.

    "text": "I just moved to the area and I thought I would give this place a try and I'm so happy I did.  Upon entering I was greeted by two very friendly employees that answered my questions and showed me around the grab and go stuff and made some suggestions.  On my first visit I had the Thai/Asian wrap is was very good and packed full of chicken and fillings, very fresh tasting. With any entree you get a choice of sides and a drink for prices starting around 7.99, I had the weekly side which was sweet and spicy slaw, which was also good. But you can choose from about 4 I think they had salad, fruit and something else.   On my second trip today I had the jalapeno bison burger which was excellent, the bison is $2 extra but totally worth it.  Instead of a bun you get a little flat little multigrain thing which was fine I bought the same thing before at grocery for sandwiches, the burger had pickled jalapenos low fat cheese and buffalo sauce and every bite was delicious. Such a great alternative to fast food.  They offer grab and go meals which are frozen I have not tried yet and they have weekly meal plans which are freshly made and refrigerated, I plan to try the meal plan asap.   Oh they have desserts which I didn't realize my first time but is bad because I'm trying to eat healthier, but I did grab a strawberry fudge today and it was excellent.",

The person at the counter was very helpful and helped us figure out what we wanted to order.  I settled on the Fiesta Flatbread and Mike N got the Wasabi Crab Wrap.  We grabbed cups and got some of the complimentary water/flavored water drinks and headed outside with our number.  Within in a few minutes, our healthy lunches were delivered and we started chowing down!  My fiesta flatbread was just enough food and my side of fruit yogurt was just the sweet desert that I needed.    We checked out the coolers with the grab-n-go meals briefly on our way out - seems like a great healthy alternative to takeout!",

This place is ideal for anyone who needs help with meal planning for fitness.

I went home and when I warmed up one of the meals I was about to throw up after a 3rd bite.

    "text": "A friend suggested we try Clean Eatz, and I really liked the idea of the Build Your Bowl as I am VERY quirky about food and usually avoid sauces as most have sugars and other ingredients that run up the calorie and carb counts. I was able to get fresh food without \"enhancement.\" (I agree with another reviewer though that the cauliflower rice I opted for was a meager couple of tablespoons. It's cheap and filling and they should really lay it on IMO)  I decided to try their meal plans.  For the past several weeks, I have ordered 5 meals weekly and pick them up at the restaurant. As I do not like to cook for one, it is a great portion-controlled nutritional meal and I appreciate being able to grab one to take for lunch or to have after work. Although the price per meal goes down if you order more, with tax it works out to about $8/meal and I cannot really go too many places and get a balanced meal for that price, so it is a value for me. The staff at Arysley are all very nice.  There is an option when one orders the meals to indicate \"no carb,\" where they substitute the starch with vegetables. This is what I get, although because I am not able to customize it any more than that, I often skip the options that have sweet teriyaki or other sauces on the protein. Alert- If you are on a keto diet, this will not meet your needs as some of the vegetables are higher carb versions than keto diets recommend and the sauces have lots of sugars, etc.  (If they ever make the \"no carb\" meals with the sauces on the side, I will be a customer for life!) I question whether this is all truly \"clean\" eating also in the strictest sense. Artificial cheese?  One week was a bad one and I took two meals back to show that there was very little in the bowl. The guy at the counter took a picture of the meals to show the manager, but did not offer me any credit for the measly portions. They must have paid heed though, because since then there are plenty of veggies to fill out the bowls, so I appreciate the effort.  Any of my feedback should not really be considered complaints as I continue to order the meals and enjoy the service overall, I just wanted to provide some detail for anyone considering the meal plans.",

    "text": "I decided to try Clean Eatz this past week after growing tired of cooking dinner for one. Their menu looked great - turkey sloppy joe w sweet potato tots, manicotti with blanched broccoli, and balsamic chicken pita with lettuce and tomatoes were the three meals I ordered. I doubled up on the manicotti and sloppy joe. These meals were not only fresh and nutritious... but they were delicious.   And for 5 meals for $38 it just can't be beat!!  I was essentially an Instagram influencer this week... I must have told everyone who crossed my path that they needed to give Clean Eatz a try.   My only recommendation would be some minor tweaks to the website. When ordering, you are asked for your address - not until the end of the ordering process do you find out it's actually your billing address that is needed. Mine are different so that was a little annoying. Also the pick up times aren't really clear, if there could be more specific pick up times listed for the individual locations that would be a great addition to the site. Something I loved is how accurate the photos were. What I saw was what I got.   Pick up was so easy and I cannot wait for the South End location to open!   I already put my meals in for next week and plan to be a long time customer!!!  Keep up the great work.. and if you haven't tried it before ... you're missing out!!!",

    "text": "This is a review for the meal delivery service. Owner Mitch has been expanding the delivery service options to buildings Uptown. He came last night to our building to discuss the product, the options, and provide meal package samples. Unlike Blue Apron and Hello Fresh, the meals are 100% ready to eat, no additional cooking and cleaning needed. (Ok, you are going to have to clean your own silverware...). I was impressed by the flexibility of the program and how truly healthy the meal options were. I frequently substitute out things (brown rice instead of white, egg whites only, specific oils I agreed of dressing for sauces, XYZ in the side) and Mitch noted that this was extremely common for them among their subscribers, who are largely people trying to eat extremely healthy (with their own needs: weight, heart, paleo, whole grain, sugar free, you name it) in a delicious and convenient way. All-in, a week seems to run $6-8 a meal, depending on how many meals you purchase and how many others are getting delivery at your location. For fresh, healthy, custom, deliciousness delivered, that is pretty impressive. Also, as a special, the delivery charge for the first week is waived!   We also walked away with two sample meals (yes, as you can imagine, some people walked away with more than they should have and Mitch was extremely gracious about it). The meals are portion controlled. That means if you need 3000+ calories a day, you will be hungry if you try to survive on three squares of just this, no two ways about it. But they are balanced meals, with healthy proteins and vegetables, and a moderate amount of carbs as whole grains. Dessert and snacks are not currently on the menu but coming soon. Each week has 5 lunch/dinner meal options plus a breakfast option. Also, the BPA-free packaging is both reusable at home and recyclable.   Based on the cilantro lime chicken I had for dinner last night and the steak and eggs breakfast burrito this morning, I am going to be signing up for this service right away. It isn't a subscription so I can just do the weeks I want and skip ones I don't or am traveling. Beats the lean cuisine frozen meals I've been living on lately!",

    "text": "I liked this place!   I love the concept. It's clean food at reasonable prices.   The menu is simple and refreshing. They offer sandwiches,snacks, wraps, flatbreads, and even burgers! But that's not all they also have a Meal Plan option available. Basically, they email you the menu and you chose what you want for the week. Just submit your order by Sunday night and pick it up on Monday.Not to mention they are freshly prepared AND perfectly portioned meals. I'm in.   I plan to place an order soon so I'll probably do an update on my thoughts after that.   But yesterday, I stopped in for lunch and ordered the Thai Wrap. You get a choice of three sides either a side salad (with low fat dressing), yogurt parfait or fresh veggies. I chose the side salad.   By the time I remembered to take the picture, most of my food was gone. So I obviously enjoyed it! But I did manage to get a great shot of goodies and fresh veggies. The Thai wrap comes with chicken, cabbage, carrots, edamame and spinach with a Thai peanut sauce. I really enjoyed it! It was super filing and I didn't have to feel bad about making an unhealthy choice!   Overall, I'm excited this place is around to give me an alternative choice for lunch.   I'm looking forward to coming back!",

I also love the idea that they have no soda machine! So the temptation isn't even there! I love the fun, bright colors of the walls here. Very hip! I will for sure to return.   Only suggestion I have is being open longer.   So if you do nothing else healthy all day, at least get your butt up and come here.",

The cool thing about this place are he grab-n-go meals that are prep'd and ready for purchase. Granted, you will still require a microwave to get the to-go meal hot and ready but it beats a frozen bag of over-frozen items. Besides, the wait isn't long during the normal weekday rush (11am-12pm) so you're in and out if you want to just order something from the menu! AND if you're not one for meal prepping your lunch for the week, you can just pay them to do it and pick all your lunches up from them, Viola!   The only drawback is the lack of organization when it comes to ordering. But they're still a little new to the scene, so I'm sure they'll get this figured out sooner or later.",

It took me about 3 minutes to read over everything and not once did the guy at the register ask if I had questions. He was not rude, but very disengaged.. especially to a first time customer. He didn't tell me if drink came with the meal or not or that I needed to grab a number; luckily I had a water bottle in my bag and grabbed the first number sign I saw. He just took my order, handed me back my card  and left, I'm guessing to tell the kitchen so they could prepare it.    I ended up ordering a pick your own bowl with chicken, brown rice, onions, broccoli, & black beans.. very blah. No taste what so ever; no seasoning at all. Looking back I'm assuming that they prepare it that way for individuals with special diets, but of course I would not have known that prior to reviving my food because I was never informed. However then the sweet chili sauce I picked to go on the side was also a no; too sweet, no spiciness at all.  Needless to say I will not be returning. I'll bring my own healthy lunch from home or head down the street to Publix for a salad.",

We came for the first time and per the website we came to those first.   However, there seemed to be some confusion about the lines, and where to order.  I'm not sure I'm correct, but this is my take. Register on the left, by smoothie machine is for dine in, there really should be a sign. If there is a sign, it isn't obvious, or I'm oblivious... not sure.  Anyways, we get 10 meals & order lunch.   He got the burrito bowl, and I get the wrap myself thin.   His burrito bowl was massive. Apparently, they are all the same size. The small, medium, and large indicates amount of protein that's in each bowl.  He ordered the medium chicken. It comes with three options he picked black beans, edamame, and Brussels sprouts.   There were a lot of sauce flavors to pick from, he went with the teriyaki.   I ordered the thin wrap with chicken, guacamole, and cheese. It was good af!   It was packed when we came in, and stayed steady till we left. They make it through the lines quickly so even if there is confusion your totally gonna get served quick.   There is water, lemonade, and infused water set out. I don't know If this is extra, I brought my own water bottle.   Give this place a shot, I hope to see more locations pop up with how people are watching what they are eating, and concerned about what is put in their bodies. I've tasted a few meals from co-workers & im pretty excited. I'll update my review next week after we start getting more into the menu, and pick up.  I have high hopes tho!!",

Not a fan of the turkey spaghetti but so far everything else has been good. I do like that your don't have to prepay on orders especially with my crazy schedule of getting down that way. Menus come out every Thursday & orders need placed by Sunday night.",
