The people were really nice and courteous. Greens are seasoned without pork. Several of the desserts were homemade as well but I passed.  Banana pudding available on Thursday through the weekend. They currently close at 7 pm during the week and Saturdays at 5 pm?? So hopefully you'll crave your soul food early.",

So I went on a Sunday afternoon; it wasn't too packed but there was a line. I had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and cabbage. My friend had the fried chicken was potato salad and Mac and cheese. I tasted both of our plates, of course! The meats(both meat loaf and fried chicken) were delicious! Both flavorful and the chicken was fried to perfection! I was disappointed in the sides though. The mash potatoes weren't bad but felt like they were missing something. The Mac and cheese was good but I like \"crumbles\" I guess you can say, and this Mac was more of a smooth consistency. The cabbage really let me down, they lacked the most flavor. I did end up re-cooking them and adding some seasoning of my own to it. The potato salad was decent. Nothing to rave about.  However, the customer service were great! The ladies are so sweet and so nice and it's clean. If I were to go back it would be for the fried chicken for sure!",

Regardless, the staff was very nice and attentive. Ordered meatloaf, Mac and cheese and green beans. Also a second order with smothered pork chop with same sides. Got home and the food was still very hot,smelled great and tasted very good. Only ate half since its stick to your ribs but about 30-40 min later both of us were very thirsty, bloated and started to have the sweats. The food didn't taste salty so they must have used MSG or a lot of seasoning salts which can hide the salt taste. Been to other soul food establishments and didn't have this issue. Won't be back since I don't need that much sodium.",

The sweet tea was good this is a must visit place and trust me there is plenty of food to choose from such as turkey legs chicken baked or fried pinto beans green beans collard greens and even stuffing they even have desserts to choose from.

I didn't do an initial review after my first visit, because I wanted my second visit to be a better one to post about. But it was worse.The first time I went I got the turkey wing plate with mac & cheese and yams. The flavor of the turkey wing was really good, but I was disappointed at the size. It should've been two wings. The yams were really good, but the mac and cheese was really dry. I couldn't even finish the mac and cheese because it wasn't enjoyable. Second trip, since I wanted more meat I got the turkey leg. The size was great. I was happy with it. Until I sat down. My first bite, the meat was hard and flavorless. It also tasted old. As I continued to try to eat it, it became clear that it was from the day before. It wasn't good at all. It was disgusting. It tasted old, was super hard, and tasted like it had no seasoning whatsoever. None. I decided to give the mac and cheese another shot and this time it was good. Much better than the first time and I was actually able to eat it. I got the yams again which were good. And the lemonade which was good as well. Plus the customer service has been great. I taste the potential, but I have just had bad experiences. If it were anywhere else I would never return after my experience with the turkey leg. But like I said, I want to like this place so bad. I think I'm going to give it one more shot, and hope the third time is a charm. If not, I'm done. I tired.",

Overall, the bbq chicken I end up getting was good with the collard greens and mashed potatoes. I'd definitely come back.",

The stewed chicken was dry and not seasoned. I asked for ox tails and was told they make them only on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays and then was told they had them. They didn't have a lot of desserts just cheesecake. I waited on fried chicken and mac and cheese and the lady stated the mac and cheese is coming out of the oven as and then they they have to put the cheese on it. I am confused because the cheese should already be on the mac and cheese. There wasn't enough food out and I was  told because they were short staffed. This was my first time here and things were disorganized and I was upset that I waited on fried chicken and mac and cheese and then get back in line and the lady tells me it is gone after I already paid for it. The prices are too much especially when the drink doesn't come with the meal. The cornbread is dry and hard. The location was clean and spacious it was just the food could be a lot better and hot and they need to have more than one person cooking so a variety of options of food can be served. The lemonade was too sweet and the tea was not sweet enough. I hope if I ever return it will be a better experience for me.",

Let me just say that it is hard for a lot of establishments to keep up great quality the more quantity they prepare. That is definitely not the case with Londa's Place. On a Saturday afternoon the food was just as great as I remembered the first time. I decided to try the beef ribs, with mac and cheese and broccoli. The sauce on the ribs was simply wonderful! If it came out of a bottle I want  to know the name so I can buy it. The ribs themselves were well done and very, very tender. Their corn bread tastes like corn bread and not cake. It has good texture and taste. When I do visit, I like to eat in and enjoy the whole experience. The only thing not to my liking is the lemonade-- it is too sweet. Next time I'll drink water and enjoy the fabulous meal.",

We found Londa's Place on Facebook and were lucky enough to eat there today during their soft opening.   Trust me you will get your whole southern Black grandma in the kitchen life when you see the food selection. I was starving so I'm glad they had food prepared already on the bar. I ordered fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, cabbage, and sweet potatoes and everything was seasoned to perfection. The only critique is that the Chicken was a little dry but I'm not taking off stars for that since it was a soft opening and their first day.   The staff were amazing and welcoming and accommodating and it gave me that family feel that should accompany any southern and soul food restaurant.   I'll definitely be back and before I left I said a little prayer for the success of this business. Shine on!",

I was able to swing by after church just before they opened at 11, and most of the food was ready with the exception of a few vegetables.  My son ordered the stewed chicken over rice, mac, green beans, and cornbread and he loved it all.  I ordered turkey wings over rice, collards, and green beans....I enjoyed everything except the green beans didn't seemed to be seasoned that well.  I also ordered a veggie plate of mac, dressing and gravy, and potato salad.....all were very good.  The desserts are mostly cake, and banana pudding.  The banana pudding was fresh and delish and overall everything was good on my first visit and my order was to go.  This restaurant is not new to the Charlotte area, as they were previously Koffee Kup on Tuckaseegee.  As I was leaving, the crowd was starting to build as it seems the word is out about Londa's in the mountain island area.",

Normal entree is a protein and 2 sides. I ordered the baked chicken with greens and Mac n cheese. It also comes with cornbread. The chicken wasn't bad. I'm not a fan of chicken on the bone but all in all. It was ok. The greens were too sweet. I know there are people who like sugar in their greens. I'm not one of them. The macaroni and cheese was down right bad. The noodles were over cooked which you can kind of see in the photos other reviewers have posted but I still wanted this to work out. It's a no for me.

While the decor inside this restaurant is not glamourous one thing this place has is good food. I have been here twice now and both times I enjoyed the food.   The first time I ordered smothered steak w/ rice, macaroni & cheese, green beans, and corn bread. When I got home the food was hot, tasty, and very filling. The food was seasoned just right and I felt like I was eating Sunday dinner. The corn bread I thought was a little large of a serving size and just a tad bit dry but it complimented my meal. The second time I went I ordered stewed chicken w/ rice, sweet potatoes (or yams...whatever you call them), green beans, and corn bread. The chicken and rice was delicious and while I think I received the last in the pan of the sweet potatoes they had great flavor. I still felt the same as I did before regarding the corn bread so next time I may try a roll.   Prices are reasonable if you consider soul food prices at other notable restaurants in Charlotte. I wish hours were a little longer in the evening however this is a new restaurant and I understand they want to make sure they are getting an ROI. Both times I visited this location it was not very busy so I was able to order and receive my food quickly. I can say that both times I've been there the customer service was great. I was greeted and assisted promptly by the staff. The staff was nice and made sure I left with what I wanted. Customer service always is high on my list and in turn I can look pass the decor and other restaurant amenities you may see at other locations especially if you also have great food. I will definitely be back to this location.",

My only feedback is, I hope they will turn on some music and/or get the tv's hooked up.  It's a little quiet environment without some back-ground noise.    I should add, this restaurant seams ideal for picking up a \"home cooked\" week night dinner.  The food was great, prices where on point, parking is convent and with the food already prepared seems like they could get it packed and have you on your way in no time.  Welcome to the neighborhood, we hope you'll stay around for a while!",

    "text": "I don't write reviews while sitting in a restaurant. Today was the exception. I walked in and was greeted kindly. The place is clean and orderly. That's always a nice touch. My vegetable plate included Mac and cheese, sweet potatoes, and greens. I cleaned the plate! I added a little pepper to the greens but other than that, the meal was scrumptious. I will be back (in my A. Schwarzenegger voice)!  Oh, the little one got the three wings meal with two sides and ate every bit! Very nice. BTW our meal totaled $20 and some change. Not bad for a meal that was worth every penny. The restaurant was beginning to fil before we left.  They are located in a Mountain Island shopping center in the Northwest corner of Mt. Holly-Huntersville Road & Highway 16. Trees may obscure your view but it is there. I found the shopping center to be nice and quiet on a warm Saturday afternoon.",

I ordered stewed chicken over rice, macaroni and cheese and collard.greens. the chicken was very bland, the macaroni and cheese was just ok and the greens were missing something. They had alot of Red pepper flakes. I wasn't too impressed with the taste of my food.",

It is served cafeteria-style by friendly restaurant staff members. This place can get pretty packed on Sundays after church! The past two times I have dined here, there has been gospel music playing on the speakers. Overall, it is a bit pricey, but worth it if you are tired of chain restaurants with the same food options. I would not recommend coming here if you are vegan or vegetarian as most of the food is likely cooked with animal fat (bacon grease, etc). I have heard that the fish is great here as well, but have not had the opportunity to try it! If you're looking for a healthy meal, I'm not so sure this would be the best place but definitely recommended if you're seeking a home cooked meal.",

I have not had a bad meal here yet which I'm surprised this is my first entry. The ambiance is homey with the cooks greeting you once you walk in the door. If there is a line, it moves pretty fast. They first allow you to choose from the vegetables they have that day. Then on to your choice of meats. I have had the ribs, meatloaf, pork chops, it is ALL very delicious. If you are looking for a nice home cooked meal with family that's not your own, look no further!",

My smothered pork chop was too tough to cut with the little plastic fork and knife that they give you.  The greens had too much sugar.  Everything else was good: sweet potatoes, corn bread and peach cobbler.  Everyone enjoyed their food for the most part. One person got the beef ribs which she said was too tough.    2nd time, I brought 10 people with me. I got the stewed chicken which was all wings and very little meat.  It comes with rice which I found out that the pork chop also comes with rice.  But, no one told me that the first time.  I asked if I could get the rice separate - I didn't want the chicken on top of the rice.  They said no, they had to serve the chicken on top of rice.  I wanted the rice separate because I wanted to get the black eye peas and put those on top.  I ended up getting sweet potatoes and greens again.  Greens were much better the 2nd time. One person got the smothered pork chop and she said it was very tender this time.  It's a nice big and clean place.  It's set up cafeteria style. They get crowded on Sundays (both times we came on Sunday).  They are super slow at serving.  The line was almost out the door but could've moved faster if the service was more efficient.  We'll probably go back because it's affordable, they can accommodate large groups and the food is good for the most part although not always consistent.",

Londa's I'd order again.  Her collards, however, were good but I'm not keen on the sweetness.  Overall, a pleasant experience and looking forward to tasting some of her other fixins.

The food is OK, but in my opinion nothing to write home about, but the pricing is the most disappointing. I had a three item vegetable plate with cornbread and a medium size styrofoam cup of ice tea, and banana pudding. My bill was $13.45. Plus, I had no one ever ask if I needed anything, which I did in the way of more tea. Didn't know if I had to refill my own, and even if I was supposed to looked around and found no refill beverage area. In summary I thought the food, service after seating, and especially the pricing very disappointing. And no where close to comparing with other nearby home cooking places like Circle G, and Stockyard Grill. These two latter named restaurants have both been in business for decades. I doubt Londas will last any where the number of years.",

Your typical plate come with a meat and two veggies. I had smothered steak (on a bed of rice) with candied yams and green beans. Just like grandma's house. The steak was moist and juicy, the candied yams were perfectly sweet and the green beans were green beany.
