    "text": "Never again!.. Just moved to Charlotte... Asked people in the office about decent places to eat, etc. Somebody said Berdardin's. Once week was over I headed that way. It was 5 min till 5pm. I tried to open the door - it was locked. Some not very friendly looking gal opened it and said \"We are open in 5 min, come back.\" I told her that I would sit quietly at the bar and I won't bother anybody for 5 (!) min. She looked at me and said again - \"No, wait outside.\" Forget for a second that it is still January, I don't think 5 min at the bar would affect anyone's life. I guess, the business is good. And I am sure, it will be even better without me going back there ever again. I am sure it is a good place. Too bad - I will never know. Btw, I walk by that place every day. The place is never packed. I grew up around restaurants. If I learned anything - it is a tough business. Good luck with everything, guys!",

    "text": "Recently visited Bernardin's while in Charlotte for a convention. It was pretty easy to find and a 5 minutes walk from our hotel. I had done a little research in advance and tried to seek out some 'recommended' eateries in downtown Charlotte. Bernardin's did not disappoint. We dined on a Friday night around 8pm, I made a reservation, but it was not necessary on this particular night. We were quickly seated in the main dining area. It is a little odd when you first walk in as the hostess takes you past the bar down the hallway to the dinning area. But once in the dining area it was very nice, and comfortable. The service was very good, and the server answered any questions, and offered some suggestions. I opted for the Pepper Crusted Filet Mignon, and my friend ordered the New Zealand Venison. Our meals came in a timely manner and were outstanding. Maybe one of the best filet's I have ever had, and I have eaten a lot of nice steakhouses. The goat cheese complemented the filet perfectly and it was cooked just as requested at medium well. I tried my friend's venison and it was equally as delicious and she also felt the meal was amazing. I can't remember exactly what the desert was that we shared, but it was excellent as well. I will definitely be returning to Bernardin's the next time I am in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Came here last Saturday for Charlotte Restaurant Week. We walked so I can't comment on parking.  The place is super tiny....however, I think that is what makes it unique and adorable. We started with a bottle of Chardonay, which was decently priced and very good.   Appetizers: Tuna Sahimi and Clam Chowder. The sashimi was good. However, the chowder was absolutely amazing. I love chowder and this was top notch. Not overly creamy but just perfect. This could have actually been my favorite part of the night!  Entree- Lamb shank and CAB filet. Husband ordered the lamb.....super huge portion. I have no clue how he finished it. It fell right off the bone. My filet was cooked so well and the mushroom sauce on top was a perfect compliment. The blue cheese (I hate blue cheese btw!) mashed potatoes was so unique and different.   Dessert- Creme Brulee and Chocolate Torte- Didnt actually try to the torte but the Creme Brulee was PERFECT! Such an amazing ending.  So glad that we had the opportunity to come here!",

    "text": "I had never heard of Bernardin's, so did not know what to expect.  We Ubered over so I cannot comment on parking.  We were dining rather early (7pm) and there were very few people when we arrived. By the time we left around 9 though, it was quite lively. Def, go a little later if you like that kind of energy. We started with gin martini and both remarked that it did not seem very cold. Many places shake martinis so much they have shards of ice in them that water the drink down. I guess I'd rather have it a little less cold than watery, but I think a good bartender can do both.  Everything else was pretty spot on.  I had the Foie Gras starter. It was rich, creamy, and decadent- the peach compote complemented the liver in texture and taste. It was also a good sized portion, so I was glad I had only ordered a salad for my entree.  My dinner partner had the TunaTuna starter and he said it was very good (not much elaboration).  Next, I had the fried gulf oyster salad. The oysters were a little on the smaller side. I don't say that as a complaint; sometimes fried oysters are quite big and for those who aren't full-fledged oyster lovers, can be off-putting. They were a tad heavily breaded, but still were not too heavy to taste the actual oyster. The warm pine nut vinaigrette on the side was interesting. I lived the spicy arugula, and the tomatoes left me wishing for a little bit more of them. I thought the salad was just divine.  My partner got the Grouper special. I did taste this. It was absolutely delicious. Two generous pieces of fish lightly treated, but so flavorful. Like the Foie Gras dish, the flavor and texture combinations on the plate were spot on perfect. (Yes, I used the word perfect)  We had coffee (not very hot) and cobbler for dessert. Again, another very seasonal usage of peaches with berries topped with a scoop of ice cream.  Our server was cute and personable. We did feel a little rushed a couple times although upon sitting I explained we planned on hanging out for awhile.  I would definitely come back here. The menu is exciting, the Chef obviously understands food on a higher level, and there are way too many things I saw that I'd like to try.",

But the server was attentive. Prompt, and attended to us well during the meal. Drinks were... Good not great. Brie stuffed chicken was good, not like I'd go back for it again though. GF got the lamb. She won't shut up about it. Lamb came out medium when she ordered it medium rare. But it was good and that risotto was incredible. Overall, worth trying. We'll prob go back.",

I ordered the Spicy Shrimp app, Curried Lamb Shank, and Creme Brulee. Best item was Creme Brulee! A larger portion than some locations.   However,  after we thought we would be able to fellowship and mingle, maybe get another drink or something with friends we were asked to leave. She said she had another 4 person party coming in and she needed the table. There were multiple other tables available with 2, 4, 6, plus seats. It was extremely rude. And to top off the insult she said we could have drinks at the bar, which was completely full. Plus there was a patron at the bar smoking a cigarette.    Overall, food and experience was good up into the end. I don't plan patroning that location again.",

Bernardin's reviews were very good, and while I wasn't sure about eating there, we stopped into the bar to have a couple of cocktails and an appetizer. The scallops and pork was amazing! So were the martinis. A bonus was meeting a gentleman who was a regular there on his travels from Chicago. We spent a couple of hours there, and a few more drinks, while we tried to figure out a good place to dine outdoors Uptown (who knew that was going to be such a challenge?) While we didn't have dinner, here, they were highly recommending the camel dish, which did not appeal to me whatsoever, but the quiet restaurant looked like a nice place for a lovely dinner in the future. Bar staff was great!",

I ordered the scallops, which come with a side of mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. The scallops were inconsistently cooked- some were well seared and others weren't and 3-4 of the 6 were fairly tough while the others were juicy and tender. They lacked seasoning, but the wine butter sauce was very strong (almost too strong of a wine taste). The mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables consisting of broccoli, zucchini, carrots, and green beans were decent but also exactly what you would expect.  As for service, our waitress was fairly slow to take our order and was very slow to initially bring out our drinks and complimentary bread. She was pretty friendly though so no real complaints. The portions weren't very big, but it was only $10-15 per dish with a nice atmosphere so basically what I expected.",

    "text": "While walking around UpTown on my lunch break I wanted something different so I walked and walked and as I walked I saw people sitting in a window of a restaurant which was interesting so I approached only to find a chalkboard type sign on the sidewalk that read  \"Today's Special, Pistachio crusted snow fish with roasted sweet potatoes  & snap peas\" I was immediately aroused as I am a Pescatarian and it's hard to find Good Seafood. The restaurant is more formal than the other restaurants that people busy during lunch, however I understand because it is UpTown (I'm from a REAL Big city = Chicago) and when you are in that type of area everyone works at the local businesses so they dress in business attire. My wait to be seated was little to none, the hostess was friendly and sat me comfortably at a corner table for two. My server was very enthusiastic and friendly and immediatly offered me water (which I ordered a Voss Still water), he was also understanding of my desire for a black napkin as opose to the white napkins on the table (lenthy for business clothes) and returned with the water and napkin promptly. He told me about the soup of the day and the special and I immediately asked for the special which he was excited about and told me that I'd made an excellent choice.  The  Pistachio crusted snow fish with roasted sweet potatoes & snap peas came out and was displayed amazing. It almost looked to good to eat, however I begin ti dig in and my initial thought was that it was too much and I wouldn't finish it (leftovers for lunch tomorrow) however it was sooooooooo GOOD that I finished ;-)  I've been back again and the special was herb crusted talapia over white bean mousse with grilled veggies which I had with a side of Voss. It was AMAZING!!  I highly recommend this place for lunch, I can't wait to take my husband for dinner and experience the dinner menu and specials. Maybe I'll order from the menu at that time as I only order the specials because the item is fresh in that day.",

We sat down ordered our beverages while we looked over the menu. Once our beverages arrived we ordered the escargot and crab cakes for our appetizers, we devoured them!! Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Once Allison came by and cleared the table, we ordered our entrees. We enjoyed the ahi tuna raw, and the ribeye. Once again, DEVOURED it!!! For our dessert I enjoyed the bread pudding with a glass of port, and he enjoyed the sorbet.

After being sat in the main dining room, I watched three different servers wait on other tables and painstakingly set up cleared tables, all while studiously ignoring me for ten minutes.  After glancing at the server setting up the four top right next to me, making eye contact and getting NOTHING in return I finally asked, \"Do I have a server?\"  She came over a little confused, \"Oh do you want to order a drink?\" \"I'd like to order lunch,\" I replied. She took my order and left. She asked if I wanted sweetener or lemon with my iced tea and I said no thanks. She returned with my tea, with sweetener and lemon. No harm, no foul, but not very bright.  My food came out quickly and with it my first sign of my server who apologized for the delay. After laying eyes on my mythical server and the apology I was ready to forgive and forget and just enjoy my lunch. It was good.  The issue was that she completely disappeared again. And again the three servers who were constantly setting up tables walked right by my empty tea glass and avoided all eye contact. Finally my server showed up again and when I asked for more tea she said, \"To go?\" I was still eating!  Just a frustratingly unprofessional experience for such a high end restaurant. I realize solo female diners are often viewed as lousy tippers but as a former server myself I tip damn well for good service. Here, I felt more ignored than anything. I won't be returning. For the same price point Ruth's Chris offers better food and service for lunch that far surpasses anything you'll get at Bernardin's.",

For a business lunch tougher to find many better choices in Uptown Charlotte, I had a curried shrimp over rice for lunch, maybe $13 for a nice sized portion and it was flavorful without being heavy handed with the curry spice. Perfect for lunch. Have a go yourself.",

I was about to order the curry grouper, but the waitress recommended the kangaroo.  Yup, kangaroo.  I don't know what I was thinking, but I ordered it.  It had a cumin sauce, and was cooked medium even though I took their suggestion and requested medium rare.  It was tender, but had a funny texture, and the sauce overwhelmed the meat and made it very one demential on flavor.  The sauted veggies that came with it were too garlicky.  I think I just picked the wrong dish.  The other plates I saw looked very good.  Would I go back?  Maybe.  I would just stay away from the Kangaroo.  That should have been common sense...",

Came with a work colleague from out of town and decided to go to one of my fave haunts. He had the same thing. We both loved it! My only knock is that the cream sauce was poured directly over the encrusted fish so the whole crunchy element of encrusting got lost with the sauce. I would recommend keeping the sauce separated and letting the customer pour it or dip it, keeping the fish a tad crunchy.  But other than that the flavors were there and service is always good. It's nice to know Susan on the Waitstaff as she always takes good care of her customers, especially me. Yeay!",

The service still has room for improvement, especially the bar area. The 2 of us wanted to get a drink while waiting for the table, and the bartender barely gave us her minimal attention after we stood there for awhile.    The presentation for the food was lacking a little, but as long as it tasted good I don't per se care. The curried lamb shank is still the \"it\" item in my opinion, and ironically it is not on their regular menu. My only complaint is the calamari - for $12 it is the saddest looking, smallest plate of fried calamari I have seen. It tasted ok, but definitely skip it in my opinion.  This place has to be one of the most underrated place to consider during the restaurant week madness.",

The staff at the Bernardin were very accommodating, flexible and friendly.  I ordered the Baked Oyster Rockefeller, Certified Angus Beef (CAB) Filet with soy butter glaze, fingerling potato, shiitake, Parmesan veal cream jus, and a Classic Creme Brulee for dessert. The appetizer was just okay. It sort of had a fishy taste to it. The filet was delicious! I got mine medium rare and it had a great crust on the outside. I really liked the addition of shiitake as it created a dish rather than just a piece of steak on a plate. Finally the creme brulee was a great and simple way to finish the meal.    I have to admit that I was initially deceived into thinking that this was somehow related to Le Bernardin (Eric Ripert) but that whole foodie dispute shouldn't prevent you from just enjoying some good eats.",

The food was out of this world. James was our server and he tried to make it the best experience we could have. Queens Feast meant they were swamped and he took exceptional care of us. My wife was running late as I came straight from work and she took the train into town (which was shuttered for some reason) and delayed in arriving. James took care of me while we waited on her arrival.  Our time frame was tight as a result. We both ordered the Surf and Turf and its was wonderful. Mine came with Salad and Sorbet. Nancy had NE Clam Chowder (of course) and the Bread Pudding. Bless you! It was  great. Our seats were upstairs on a small balcony of what used to be Radcliff Flower Shop. What a great evening and James made sure we made the time up with service -- we even got to the show early. Thank you sir.",

We saw the lunch menu sign outside and definitely thought that it would be down our alley. Walked in and we were pleasantly surprised to see that this was a higher end restaurant. The tables were set to proper etiquette and the wait staff was trained to the etiquette as well. We figured that since the atmosphere was so nice that the food couldn't be that good but we were very wrong. Food came out quickly and was presented very nicely. The only thing we didn't like about the restaurant was the host staff. We were greeted coldly and without interest so to outsiders we were weary of Bernardin's before we sat down. We're happy that everything else exceeded expectations upon our first encounter. We will be coming back to Bernardin's when we come back to Charlotte.",

I've dined in both areas and they are both enjoyable. The main dining area is very romantic. It would be a great place to celebrate a special occasion.   The service started off slow. We went on a Saturday and the place was packed with people heading to the theater. We waited so long for our waitress that we considered leaving. However, both our waitress and the manager apologized for the long wait and offered us free appetizers to make up for the slow start.   Boy, am I glad we stayed; the food was DELICIOUS! We started with two appetizers: the goat cheese tart with fresh arugula and the duck confit spring rolls. They were both excellent. I was especially impressed with the spring rolls. They were some of the best I've ever had: very fresh and flavorful.   For my entree, I ordered the lamb chops with risotto. My friend ordered the sauteed ahi tuna with wasabi sauce. Again, we were both thoroughly impressed. We had a side of sauteed spinach and truffle mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was amazing. I couldn't get enough.   For dessert, we split the peach and blueberry cobbler with pecan praline ice cream. The presentation was beautiful. What a wonderful way to finish an exquisite meal. Everything was spectacular. It's one of the best meals that I've had in a long time.  Well prepared food in a beautiful environment served by a friendly waitress. What more can you ask for? I'll definitely be back.",

The waters weren't refilled, we sat waiting at an empty table for what seemed like a long time, and still wanted to order desserts.  The server was also harder to reach out to since she spent most of the time handling the others in the back.   With all that said, the food was ok.  I had the red curry chicken and even though it wasn't loaded with meat and veggies, it was a good lunch portion.  I wouldn't come back for that price and service level for lunch unless the company is paying.  It seems the place is more popular for dinner.",

    "text": "Good gluten free dining option. Our party of four dined here Tuesday night.  It was a very good experience overall. Our waiter was knowledgeable, mostly prompt, but rather dour.  The dining room was not overly loud and we were able to converse normally.  We started with the duck spring rolls (NOT GF), the foie gras, and (on the waiters's suggestion), the Kangaroo entree split into four appetizer portions.  Of the three, the Kangaroo was DEFINITELY the star.  We all loved it.  For our entrees, one diner had the lamb while the rest of us tried the brie Stuffed Chicken. Our friend said the lamb dish was phenomenal.  The rest of really enjoyed our chicken dish. It was flavorful and juicy.  For dessert, two diners had the blueberry peach cobbler, one had the caramel apple tart and I had the creme brulee (the only GF dessert option).  The cobblers were said to be FABULOUS.  The Apple tart and the creme brulee were NOT good. Both were a disappointment and neither dish was finished. We would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone that can eat gluten. As a gluten free option, we would return but keep in mind dessert would need to be enjoyed elsewhere.",

It can be a challenge to get white napkin/tablecloth serve during lunch without breaking the bank but they pull it off.  And who doesn't love warm rolls with butter?  I do!!  You can spend this same amount at a sandwich or fast food shop.  I prefer this option and they have great menu options.  I even dined here for dinner one even and the lamb shank special with risotto was divine.  The meat was so tender it fell off the bone.  I also like the option to be able to request the booth in the window..which allow you to get a street view.  This is a great date restaurant as well as quant for friends and family.",

The salmon was cooked perfectly. May possibly be the best salmon dish I have ever had, and that says much. Service was great. The only gripe would have been wishing the hostess had not sat us at the tiny deuce table and maybe put me and my coworker on a 4-top instead.",

The spring rolls on the otherhand were a bit of a disappointment. I was excited to try them since I am a huge fan of duck but was pretty let down by it. There was hardly any duck in it and mainly packed with cabbage. The plum sauce definitely saved it to give it some flavor.",

Definitely recommend trying Bernardin's - but make a reservation because they have the same tiny dining area that Ratcliffe had!",

It's very nice on the inside, romantic and quiet. I don't know about French, but nice. I started my evening with the strawberry lemonade martini. I think they forgot the alcohol. For dinner, I had the Curry Grouper that came with jasmine rice and a mint chutney. I've never had curry that had absolutely no flavor, not even salt. To add insult to injury, the jasmine rice was extremely mushy. Just wasn't doing it for me but one of my dinner guests had the same meal and enjoyed it. The scallop and pork belly app was fantastic, my favorite of the night. We all ordered dessert, so we sampled everything. I had the creme brulee...it was okay. The chocolate tart(?) was extremely dense and rich. The strawberry shortcake was cute and tasty. Over all we had fun and good food. Not in a rush to get back.",

We did this with Bernardins, and the initial reaction was good.  Twelve of us went to dinner there last night. We are a mixed bag of affluent,  restaurant knowledgeable, well dressed people. we had reservations for 12. The table was set and the restaurant was empty save for 2 people in the corner. The hostess told us she couldn't seat 8 of us as our whole wasn't there. We were to stand in the waiting until the rest of the party arrived-restaurant policy. We asked to be seated to just order drinks and wait the rest of our party. No go. I asked for the Manager. He came out from the back. He was huffy and in the mood to argue. He relented to let us sit prior to the rest of our party arriving. Our waitress addressed the group and told us the bill would be on one ticket and there was an automatic gratuity of 20% for groups over 6. We told her that we had been assured that we could get seperate checks when we called for the reservation. She was not happy and was sullen for the rest of the evening. She was borderline uncivil.  The orders were taken on time and delivered in good manner by servers m the kitchen. The meals were very good by comments from those in our party. The food rated 4 stars - ****. The venison was perfently cooked to a medium rare; The potatos au gratin (white and sweet mixed) were perfectly baked witha crisp top, and the vegetable side was perfect.  I ordered a chocolat desert, coffee and a glass of port wine. The waitress disappeared. The desert and coffee was served but no wine. The waitress brought the wine with the checks after all were finished their coffee and deserts.  We got our individual bills, put our credit cards in them and collected them for the waitress. Whenshe arrived at the table, she made a great show of opening each folded bill and laid them on top of one another open.  The food was great, but I've had better service from more pleasant people at Mc Donalds! H PS - I sure could have used a second cup of coffee, but none was offered.",

To start with the place was less than a fifth full on a Friday night with no discernable smell of food. Our server had minimal experience with the menu and seemed unable to describe the dishes.. We started with the Scallop and Pork Belly appetizer, that had a few too many sand granules in the scallops and the pork belly was so dry I was unable to cut it, and instead tore apart. The \"heirloom\" tomato salad was nothing more then grape tomatoes atop run of the mill mozzarella, with a pile of shredded carrots (really?). The lamb chops were decent and tender but could have used a little more seasoning. The cous cous mint/sweet pea salad was just confusing. My wife's lobster ravioli tasted store bought with that \"yesterday's\" catch taste. Overall they should consider trimming 15% off the price of the menu to regain some semblance of restaurant karma, and focus their efforts on execution and training. The only time we will speak of this place is when we joke about how overpriced and bad it was.",

    "text": "I came here on a Wednesday evening (6:30) with a group of friends (party of 6). We made a reservation so we were seated right away. There is a small bar and seating area when you first walk in, but they take you to a bigger dinning room (maybe holds 100) for dinner. I would recommend making a reservation for dinner since the place isn't very big. In addition, there is an exclusive area upstairs and a bay window spot that I believe you can request to sit at.   Since it was restaurant week, everyone at our table ordered from the pre-fix menu, however I wanted to venture out and try different options with my husband. Their menu looked phenomenal, which our waiter told us changes seasonally. Some of the menu items that stood out the most were camel and kangaroo. I've NEVER seen camel on a menu before and I like to think I'm pretty adventurous with my food selections. Camel and kangaroo sounded intriguing, but I opted for two small plates and a side.  My husband ordered from the RW menu. Below is the synopsis:   Restaurant week menu items: 1.Tuna TarTare: The tuna was super fresh and the wasabi gave it a refreshing taste without it being too over powerful. 2. Curry Lamb Shank: This was the real winner! The lamb fell off of the bone and the curry flavors with the jasmine rice were paired perfectly. This is a RW exclusive dish, but it's a must!  3. Chocolate Torte: Very rich, but the ice cream balanced it out. Definitely a dessert to split.   Daily Menu items:  1. Crab Cakes ($12): The two crab cakes were placed over a black bean mix with chorizo, which was interesting. I seemed to enjoy the crab cakes better without the black beans, but the crab cakes were super meaty and tasty. I just ate the bean mixture separately. 2. Duck Confit Spring Rolls ($11): Nom Nom! The spring rolls were very delicious and served with a plum dipping sauce. Very good! 3. Side of Mac N Cheese ($5): How basic is mac n cheese?! But this mac n cheese was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBOMB.com&s=ac71b33d32e90570e9c0d70edf9b4cac5f20e98e10501794c62801370f5dd3f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">BOMB.com</a>!! It was one of the highlights of the night, plus it was ONLY $5! You must order a side of it with your meal. Trust me! This dish brought my review to 5 stars!  Overall, I would go back to Bernardins, especially for that mac n cheese ;-) It's a little pricy ($20-$30 per dish), but they also have a lunch menu that has most plates ranging from $9-$14. I'll definitely have to check lunch out since I work in Uptown! I'm a fan!",

    "text": "Preface this review based on the fact that I visited during Restaurant Week.  I usually don't base my reviews on restaurant week since it's a really busy time for these places and there's a lot that can go wrong for a restaurant during RW.  Bernardin's definitely changed my idea that RW menus are just an after-thought.  They really used RW to expose their restaurant to new customers and highlighting what they do best.  One example is their Curry Lamb Shank.  This is an item on their RW menu that is not offered on their regular menu.  So for two weeks out of the year (if you are including RW week in January/February) you can get this shank that is out-of-this world delicious.  I will be dreaming about that lamb for many nights to come.  The servers were super on-point... we had semi-early reservations and the restaurant did get quite busy by the time we left, but our server James took excellent care of us.  He actually drew more attention to the non-RW week menu to show just how creative their restaurant is.  I mean... camel, bison, and kangaroo are all on their entrees... and I am sure they are delicious as they are exotic.    I decided to stay the course and order off the RW menu... that curry lamb shank was going in my belly regardless of the tempting regular menu offerings.  Man, I was not disappointed at all!  I actually mis-placed my knife during the meal, but the lamb fell off the bone!! No knives needed here.  My first course was a pickled shrimp over watermelon, feta cheese, and cucumbers... and it was super tasty and refreshing.  The dessert course I went with was the bread pudding.  Super yummy.  Overall, I think this restaurant located next to the Green right on Tryon get's overlooked a lot during RW, but I am going to make it a point to visit more often to try their non-traditional menu choices someday.  Thank you for the tip Peggy C...!! you totally told me about Bernardin's a long long long time ago.",

I would recommend stopping in for a quick bite as the surrounding restaurants are unimpressive and filled with a menu of pizza and fried chicken. We were happy to find this place that had a refreshing menu and many options.",

    "text": "This was an unexpected surprise I was introduced to by a work friend. I've always bypassed Bernardin's and went to other lunch spots in The Green or Latta Arcade,because I figured other restaurants would be cheaper. I was pleasantly surprised when a friend suggested going there for lunch. Their lunch menu has choices including chicken, steak, seafood, and vegetable options, and the portions were just right. I was satisfied without feeling I needed a George Costanza nap. The only set back was the sanitation rating. A friend's husband works for the city environmental health department and regularly advises not to patronize restaurants with less than a 95 rating. I have not had any issues with the sandwiches and plates I have enjoyed here (veggie with pesto and portabella being my favorite!). It would just be nicer if they had a higher score.  Still, if I can have lunch with tablecloths and tableside service, I'll take it over grab and go for the same price.",

Ambience was great but the two persons tables where awkward to get into...cramped into a small place.   The menu selection was neat with Emu, Kangaroo and Muscovy Duck.   I'll be back but not at the top of my list.   Being from southwest Louisiana, it is hard for me to rate restaurants as everyone back home cooks so well.  I take that in mind when I rate restaurants.   I give each star a meaning: The first is for service... The second is for food quality and presentation... The third is for ambience... The fourth and fifth are for any exceptional qualities of the other three...",

I had the duck breast with mascarpone polenta cakes, my husband had the sauteed shrimp, our friend had the European sea bass, and his wife had the scallops with risotto. Everything was delicious -- beautifully prepared, gorgeously plated, well balanced -- everything you'd want in a lovely upscale meal...except the price was not at all outrageous. I can't recommend Bernardin's too highly -- it was a perfect evening. Our server was warm and attentive, water glasses always promptly refilled, check brought only when requested. Only one suggestion I'd make -- restaurants need to teach their servers to not interrupt conversations when they approach a table. Just approach the table, wait a moment until the guests are ready for you, not the other way around.  Thanks to Bernardin's for a wonderful evening. Go! You won't regret it.",

The menu was not overly extensive, but was very full and offered traditional as well as rare choices. Despite the fact I had gone in intending to order a steak, and my general resistance, I ordered the venison as my main course. It was perfect and wonderful. The appetizers We shared were kangaroo and camel. The kangaroo was like a pot roast and was less desirable than the camel. Having traveled Northern Africa and the Middle East, the thought of eating camel did not make my bucket list. It is on my always order list now. It's taste is like a mix of prime rib and New York strip. The wine list is excellent and affordable. The venue clean and current. The staff competent and attentive.",

They had a couple interesting dishes like kangaroo that I would've tried if it was a little cheaper.  The chicken had a lot of flavor and the stuffed brie was a nice touch. Made it a bit juicier. The mashed potatoes were on the drier side, the the jus all around the plate made it better and grilled asparagus could've been seasoned more.",

I stationed myself at a table outside to enjoy the lovely weather. The servers were all extremely friendly and didn't treat me any differently than other guests even though I was dining alone.   Since it was hot day, I decided to start with a chilled lobster gazpacho. It was saltier and spicier than I expected; in fact, it tasted like salsa for chips. The cup of \"salsa\" was difficult to enjoy and the small pieces of flavorless lobster were drowned out by the soup.  Luckily, the entree was much better. I had the mahi mahi special of the day, which was cooked well and served with a fried potato and cheese fritter. The entire dish was delicious.  I do wish the side didn't have to be fried but I have to remind myself, this is not California.",

The greeting by the hostess and the service by our waiter were exemplary.    The food was fresh, well-prepared and delicious.  Decent wine list.  We really enjoyed our food and our evening.  They have a tiny bar at the entrance and a weird dining area at the entrance as well.  The entry/hostess stand/bar can get a little crowded right there, so I feel bad that they even have that dining area right there.  It is completely separated from the rest of the restaurant, so I wonder if it's for walk-ins?  Kind of strange.  If you are making reservations you can request the \"Kings and Queens of Bernardin's\" half-moon booth which is at the very front in the bay window so you are looking out over the whole restaurant with the window at your back.  On cold days, it can be quite chilly at your shoulders and neck, so be prepared.  The other table seems to be a keyhole loft table where you would look down and out over the whole restaurant.  It's over a service area and there is a service door there as well, so though it seems private, it also seems like it could be a bit of a noisy clatter going on around you.  There are tables and booths along both walls which would be preferable to the center aisle of two-top tables, because you are seriously sitting elbow to elbow with strangers.  At least that keeps it quiet!  I'd definitely go again.",

The restaurant is small but decorated with an eye to detail and while there are several tables in a small space they are laid out so that I did not feel encroached on. They have an exclusive table for two on a second level that privately overlooks the restaurant. I definitely want to sit there next time!   Since this was date night we ordered a bottle of wine from their extensive list. Our friendly waitress presented the wine for a sample for us to confirm and made sure to keep our glasses full during the meal.   To start I ordered the garlic shrimp which came in a little bowl in a broth which was a surprise but delicious. The boyfriend ordered the clam chowder which was the best clam chowder I have had since San Francisco. I ordered the filet medallions medium, but they came out medium well but were still delicious. I also enjoyed the blue cheese mashed potatoes.  The star of the night was the braised curry lamb shank. I am not usually a fan of lamb but this dish was phenomenal. It was so tender it was falling off of the bone and the curry sauce was light and fragrant. I don't believe I have ever had a steak in front of me and ever envied anyone else's dish - especially not a lamb dish! Unfortunately this wonder is not on the regular menu.   While I would love to give them a 5 star rating my steak was overcooked and our favorite dish of the night is only available twice a year during restaurant week. I do have my eye on the curried grouper and can hopefully bump the rating up after a meal off of their regular menu.",

If this pops up in your search....mark my words...go, and don't look further. You mouth will thank you.",

Bernardin's had lots of choices that we would never cook at home - Kangaroo, Swordfish, Emu.  Our server Sean was really nice. He was there when we needed him, otherwise he left us to our dinner and chit chat.   Apps - Tuna, Crabcakes  Dinner - Kangaroo, Swordfish special, Macaroni side  My boyfriend wasn't crazy about the veggie cake under his kangaroo, but he really loved his dish & the spices. The sauces were amazing.  My swordfish was tender and tasty. The brussels and potato cake were amazing too!  Crabcake was our favorite appetizer!   Atmosphere is charming & quiet.",

My mother and I both had the filet mignon, our family friend had the fish special and my brother had the duck. Everyone of our meals were absolutely fantastic. As appetizers we split the fois gras and the duck because we were not hungry enough to each order an appetizer. We also certainly underestimated the portions of the appetizers. The appetizers were great the food Gras was delicious but caution fois gras is after all an acquired taste you either like it or you don't. My brother and I loved it while my mother and our friend preferred the crab cakes. Meal wise we loved our choices im pretty sure every single plate was clean when we were done. For dessert we ordered the chocolate cake and the pudding. We loved the pudding it was accompanied by a ball of vanilla ice cream. It was soft and warm and perfect. It wasn't too sweet it was an absolute delice. That being said the chocolate cake was a bit too sweet for our liking. The waiter was absolutely excellent. He was kind and helpful without being overbearing at all. I totally recommend this restaurant.",

The atmosphere is blah - dated decor and a fishy smell. Additionally, the dining area is QUITE loud which makes a work lunch difficult.   Our waiter was great - friendly, attentive, and fast. The food was unfortunately not good. I had the shrimp curry and it was so bland and flavorless. It did not taste like curry at all. One of my coworkers had the curry as well and she had the same thoughts as me.  Overall, none of us were impressed with our food.  Additionally, as we were leaving (a bit after 1), we noticed that many of the waiters, waitresses, hostesses, were gathered at the bar near the door having their lunch. I understand that these people have to eat, but doing so in the front entrance / exit of the restaurant such that every patron gets a front row seat to their casual, loud lunch is poor tase in my opinion.   Overall, the food and atmosphere were poor; our waiter was great. I don't recommend this place.",

For the first course, I had the seared ahi tuna. It was perfectly seared and very flavorful. Second course I had the surf & turf. In some photos I saw, the portions looked small, but I assure you that is not the case! The steak was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes had a good texture. My only criticism would be that it could've been seasoned a bit more. I was stuffed, but still ordered the chocolate torte for dessert. I saw some reviews say it was very rich, but I found it to be pretty light (in a good way!). The atmosphere was really interesting, too. They sat us in \"the fish bowl\" which was great for people watching.   All in all, $35 is a steal for a meal that's typically much more pricey. I would pay more for that meal on any other occasion!",

We ordered the ahi tuna tartare as an appetizer, a bottle of the clos du val Pinot noir, and the filet mignon entree.  -ahi tuna was 4/5  -Clos du Val Pinot noir 5/5 great body and flavor for cost of bottle  -Filet mignon was 5/5 melted in my mouth, so much flavor and very fair price for quality of the dish  Would definitely recommend! Service was superb, but like I said earlier, it wasn't very busy on a Monday night so not sure what their service is on a poppin Friday night. We received everything and finished eating with great conversation in between bites all within 50 minutes.",

    "text": "So now I am a long time Charlottean and either we hit this place on just a lucky evening or why in the world have we never eaten here before. We split a Caesar Salad which was one of the best have ever had.  Not to heavily dressed or too garlicky with big pieces of parmesan and not too many croutons. Had the lamb which came with two racks of three, cooked to medium-medium rare perfection with great mint sauce again not to heavily applied and this cous cous risotto! I normally do not like cous cous but these were little pillows of soft creamy pasta that melted in your mouth. Also, the lobster ravioli was awesome with huge pieces of lobster meat and shrimp in a fantastic sauce.  Table next to us had the filet that looked perfect. Cannot believe we have not been here before. A must try!",

    "text": "This place is an absolute staple of mine for a nice lunch and dinner out (and even to-go lunch when I'm working uptown because I'm that obsessed with their salmon and scallops).   Their menu is expansive enough that you can make everyone happy, from large salads, fish (salmon, grouper, scallops), chicken, and filet mignon, to dishes for the more adventurous like emu, kangaroo, and duck. They do an awesome job with all their entree dishes, accompanying each with some type of vegetable and carb (usually).   For lunch: My absolute favorites are the Pan Roasted Atlantic Salmon and Pan Roasted Sea Scallops because both come with this heavenly lemon basil wine butter atop mashed potatoes. The Duck Confit Spring Rolls are tasty but definitely more on the heavier side.   For dinner: they do some awesome specials -- I've had lobster ravioli before, accompanied by a whole lobster head and tail. I'd be adventurous and order something you wouldn't typically be able to from other places, like the emu, duck, and kangaroo. But the Scallops with mushroom risotto is also a great savory choice.   They're beautifully nestled in the old Ratcliffe flower shop, so the flowered stained glass windows are a Charlotte staple.   Pro tip: you MUST make a reservation. 99% of the time when I do a walk-in I'm told they're fully booked and can not accommodate.",

For the first course, I had the scallops with risotto and my husband had the fried green tomatoes with sausage and shrimp. We loved both items. For the second course, I went with the surf and turf and my husband had the lamb. We also shared some truffle mac and cheese. He absolutely loved his and I liked mine a lot but wasn't crazy about the sauce on my steak. We both loved the mac and cheese! Finally, for dessert I had the cream brulee and he had the bread pudding. Both were absolutely delicious!!!!!!   Our server was just okay. Other servers seemed to be more attentive to us than our server (refilling our drinks, bringing our food, asking if we needed anything, etc.). We noticed people with a different server who arrived after us, ordered the three course feast and left 10-15 minutes before us. We weren't in hurry or anything like that, but our server simply wasn't very present.   Regardless, we really enjoyed our meal and will definitely return!",

They claim to be \"fine dining\", which the ambiance certainly complies.  Service was friendly and pretty attentive. I ended up ordering the scallop risotto, lamb shank, and bread pudding.   The scallop risotto was perfect. The flavor of the lamb shank was tasty, but it had that mushy texture as if it had been cooked in a Crock-Pot. I prefer a little more chew to my meats. The bread in my bread pudding seemed to be undercooked, and was disproportionate compared to the ice cream.  My girlfriend's meal also had some inconsistencies. One of her beef medallions  was completely the wrong temperature.  Her creme brulee was also cooked unevenly, with some spots being very bitter frok being torched too much.   I probably sound very picky, but I feel like there should be a higher standard for fine dining establishments. The food was good, but not great. And there were just too many inconsistencies to warrant five stars. Although I am interested in trying more of their menu items.",

I ordered the clam chowder, surf n turf, and creme brulee. The clam chowder was tasty, reminded me of a loaded potato soup full of clam chunks. The surf n turf consisted of two beef medallions and shrimp atop a side of spinach, mushroom, and mashed potatoes. I requested my beef medium-well. One medallion came medium-well as requested, but the other was medium-rare. Quality control can use some work but no biggie. I finished both anyway. The creme brulee was good, with a thin carmelized sugar layer and thick creme.   Ambiance was classy with white tablecloths, sculptures, and tasteful paintings. Service was friendly and on point too. My glass was always quickly refilled. I would come back just to try the emu and kangaroo dishes, which sound really fun!",

Also, they have a \"Fish of the Day\" special, every day.  One of my favorites is the pan seared snapper w/ a citrus beurre blanc sauce. I mean the fish was cooked so perfect and they don't skimp on portions!  You name it, they hit on it! My friend I come here often and a lot of those times get served by James. James is great!

I notice clientele are mostly mature adult and senior, may be they deliberately do that for health reason. The version was cook perfectly rare medium rare but the meat itself was not silky smooth, it's not tough, it just not the highest quality meat, possibly previously frozen but somewhat expected. The dinner roll was fantastic !  After gone to The Stanley the night before, this is just a notch behind, it still a fantastic place to dine in all regard especially going to concert after.

Calamari was spiced and the dipping sauce was great.    For the main dishes, we ordered black bass and surf and turf. Surf and turf was served with shrimp and fillet medallions. The beef was cooked perfectly medium! Black bass was mediocre.   We had chocolate torte and sorbet for the dessert. Chocolate torte was rich and pretty good. Liked it was not too sweet. Mixed berry and blood red orange sorbet went well with chocolate dessert.  We overall enjoyed our dinner at this restaurant. The server was friendly, the atmosphere and food was good!

I had the scallop risotto with the braised lamb shank followed by mango and blood orange sorbet. My entire meal was awesome. I also tasted the limpico drink and ended up ordering a second one. Our entrees were more than plentiful and our server was a delight. I don't remember her name, but she was a slender dark haired female, in case the manager's reading lol, and she was super attentive and fun. I will definitely return to this location and recommend it to others.",

We had a very special reason to celebrate and I wanted the evening to be extra special so I mentioned this in my reservation notes. When we arrived the hostess took us up to a balcony seating area that overlooked the main dining room, it was perfect! We started with the goat cheese tart and duck spring rolls, both were delicious. We ordered one heirloom tomato salad to share and they brought it to us on separate plates, a very nice touch as the portions seemed slightly larger than if we had just eaten off one plate. He ordered the kangaroo and I ordered the lobster ravioli with a Maine lobster tail on top, both were perfect. Our waitress had the special, and rare, ability to make us feel like the only table in the restaurant without coming by too often. The decor is beautiful and I think it's worth asking for the balcony table if you are looking for a romantic dinner setting. Five stars for sure!",

    "text": "Heading to a restaurant during restaurant week is a double edged sword. As a guest, I typically have moderate expectations as I know the restaurants in question can be absolutely inundated with customers. And sometimes the participating restaurants shine. And sometimes they totally take a digger.   A group of girlfriends and I decided to make a reservation at Bernarndin's for Queen's Feast so we were able to check out a variety of items on the menu, catch up, etc. The interior is still lovely and hasn't changed much since Ratcliffe on the Green - the few exceptions being that there's more \"artwork\" of sorts on the walls.   We were seated fairly promptly and our server came and walked us through the menus. Now, I completely understand that everyone (servers included) can have a rough day. Or a rough night. Or even a rough few days. And I'm certain our server was having one of the above. Girlfriend didn't crack a smile the entire night. She didn't seem happy to be there or even remotely interested in serving us. A few of us tried to make her laugh and that didn't even work.   On to the food and drinks...we all ordered a cocktail of sorts and when one was misdelivered to my buddy, and identified as such, the server replaced it with the correct drink and then took it away \"to trash it.\" Um, why wouldn't you just offer the drink up to the table to enjoy rather than throwing away a perfectly fine cocktail? Odd.   Food wise, I went off the restaurant week menu (because it was very different than what I saw online - which is fine, I know they have to make accommodations with ingredients) and ordered the scallops. I snacked a warm roll, drank my nicely made dirty martini and waited. The scallops came out in a very nice sized portion with loads of risotto and, unfortunately, plenty of oil. My scallops were cooked nicely on one side (seared to perfection on the top) and a little under cooked on the other side. The flavor was nice on those little discs. However, the risotto and pools of oil that had coagulated in the corners really turned me off. Said risotto was cooked nicely but it was completely overloaded with salt. And the puddles of oil ruined the fresh taste of the scallops. Sad. To be fair, I tasted my friend's filet and it was delightful. I had total meal envy.   For dessert I sampled a bit of my girlfriend's peanut butter cheesecake with Oreo crust - nicely done, great flavor and texture. I ordered the strawberry shortcake which was very light and airy but lacked sweetness. My dessert was *fine* but I wouldn't order it again. When we received our bill, from grump-a-pot-a-pus, our gratuity was automatically added - to the tune of 20%. Automatically adding gratuity to a six top is all fine and well, a) let us know that you did so, in person and b) usually when I see an auto-gratuity it's in the 15-18% range.   Now, if I received this type of service and sub par eats during any time but restaurant week it would be a stretch to rate Bernardin's a 2 star. But to be fair, the restaurant was packed, our server was in a crappy mood, so I'm hoping I just went on a very off night.",

Still tasted good minus the soggy salad.    My salad which had blackened tuna was very good and my husband got a sandwich which was incredible - he got the grilled ahi tuna with fried eggplant, wasabi aioli, caramelized onion - highly recommend.  I think I just ordered wrong - too much tuna.  Should have tried the scallops but husband looked like he was going to yack when I said I was going to order scallops for lunch.  Service was fine.  I enjoyed the restaurant atmosphere - parts of it looked old and had character (which I love)...and parts of it didn't....actually that was kind of confusing, but overall a good experience and will try again.",

    "text": "Going to have to agree with Nicole W on this one; if it hadn't been Charlotte Restaurant Week it would be tough to even award Bernardin's two stars. Our server was a total grouchy pants. We even tried to joke with her a bit but it did no good. In terms of the menu, it was totally different from the one posted online, which is fine in theory, but threw me off since all the items I wanted to order were no longer listed in the deal. Here's a breakdown of the night:  Drinks: I ordered a martini - server brought it - I sipped from it and thought it wasn't what I ordered, but it was good so I didn't say anything. Five minutes later the server comes over and says she gave me the wrong drink and swaps them out. I let her know I'd already sipped from it and she said \"well I was going to trash it anyway\" in a snotty tone. Not sure why she didn't just leave it on the table for us to drink, but was so aghast at her tone that she was gone before I could bring it up. Strike one.  First course: I ordered the tuna tartare and it was 3/4 stars. Great flavor but such a small serving that I only had a few bites before it was gone.  Second course: I ordered the salmon with potato cake and sauteed spinach. Nice size meal, and all tasted good - I give it 3/4 stars as well.  Dessert: 3/4 stars as well. Peanut butter cheesecake with Oreo crust. Cheesecake wasn't as sweet as I'd hoped but still good.   Service: terrible. Like 1/4 stars. And then she added a 20% gratuity and never mentioned it. Twenty percent? Really? I'm okay with a gratuity charge for a six top table, but not 20%; especially for the sour puss that we had.  The space is very pretty and the ambiance quite nice. Bring in your parking ticket from the lot by The Green and they'll validate. Just hope you don't get the server we had!",

    "text": "Snappy and elegant dining experience in a great setting with serious skills coming from the kitchen.  When it's time to impress, Bernardin's makes my short list.  I dined here with a party of 4 on a busy Saturday night during Restaurant Week, and was a bit on edge having read some other trusted reviews.  Luckily, though, we were treated like rock stars all night.  The hostess staff was quick to acknowledge our reservation and offered us a seat at the bar while things were readied.  Only quibble here: I counted three hostesses, but they all seemed to answer (and move) to a manager who was keeping a very close tab on things.  Understandable during a busy weekend crunch, but when space is a premium (as it is here) I think less is more and I love it when a host/hostess has total command of the front of house.  The restaurant space is divided a bit odd, with a small bar at the door and then a narrow dining area behind a wall that runs parallel to the entrance.  That said, the dining room is truly enchanting, with the stained glass windows that harken back to the old flower shop this space once held, and a large bay window looking out onto Tryon Street.  The bar has a pretty full drink list and the wine list had numerous options by the glass, while the bottle offerings were extensive.  Great to see a curated wine list that belies the actual size of the dining room.  Prices were typical for a finer restaurant, though most all price points were covered.  Our server was definitely on his A game and kept it there all night.  Wine came to the table immediately and glasses were filled without delay.  Our first course came out in under 3 minutes of ordering and the rest of the meal was appropriately paced.  Now given the fixed menu at Restaurant Week, this is not totally unexpected, but it was good to see that the kitchen and service staff were coming with their 'A game.'  That said, we were never rushed and never felt like anyone was standing over us.  Food was great.  I had a tuna tartar that was just a couple bites, but very well done and seasoned just right.  Salmon for an entree was really great, though I was not asked how I liked it cooked.  Since I like my salmon a little more to the done side of things, this was not an issue, but asking never hurts when a majority of folks like their salmon medium.  Polenta cake side and accompanying sauce was also well done.  My other party guests apparently enjoyed their entrees as well- lamb shank, and sirloins- as no one offered to share a bit!    Dessert, though, was a stand-out.  Chef's cheesecake was a white chocolate with carmelized banana crust.  Utter goodness.  We also had the fresh berry sorbet and it included a generous portion size.  I know the desserts can be an after-thought, especially during Restaurant Week, but these were show stoppers in their own right.  My party of 4 left duly impressed on all fronts.  While there were some substitutions from the published menu put online, I dare say there were no downgrades.  This was upper end dining done right.  Great place to impress clients, family or mark a special occassion.",

    "text": "I visited Bernadin's last week after reading more than a few positive reviews on Yelp. I hosted four important clients. I'll start by stating that the presentation, quality, and taste of food was superb.   BUT - here's where it took a few peculiar turns. We were seated at the window table just across from the bar. I was told it would be a quiet spot which would allow for conversation. And it was. First BUT - our server doubled as the bartender thus she would disappear for extended periods. Apparently she later called for reinforcements and all was good. I first ordered a bottle of wine only to have the server/bartender come back after a faitpr bit of time passed to say \"sorry, but we 're out of that wine.\" So I went up the ladder and ordered a finer bottle (read $$).   After reading reviews of a few entrees two of us ordered the lobster ravioli.  Second BUT - after more time elapsed the server returned to say \"sorry but we're out of Ravioli - will another pasta suffice\". OK we both agreed on Capellini or something. Third BUT - now it gets comical - the server returns to say \"sorry, but we only have one lobster\". WTF. This is Friday night and on the relatively early side. I passed and of course let my client have her choice.  If not for how good everything was I might have raised much more of an issue. I excused myself to and left the table to settle the charges and to have a diplomatic chat with the manager. The bartender/server said he'd be right out. BUT , he or she never surfaced. As a concession they removed one of the appetizers from my bill.  Would enjoy dining there again BUT.........  You decide.   Food close to a 5, service a 3.5, inventory control 0. Management ??",

I chose a cobb salad, thinking it was a safe bet.  The presentation was nice, but the food quality was decidedly sub-par.  The grilled chicken tasted like it had been cooked in the morning (or possibly the night before?) and kept in a plastic bag.  The bacon had no flavor - it didn't even taste like bacon.  The olives were definitely canned, and there was turkey lunchmeat on the salad that tasted like the cheapest processed turkey you could get.  The greens and other vegetables were ok.  The bread was good, and the service really was great.  Next time I'm going across the street to Halcyon; it's worlds better than Bernardin's and it's in the same price range.  But really, even Jason's Deli has better grilled chicken on their salads.",

There was some weird funky taste.  Also the lump crabcakes with black beans, corn and chorizo sausage sounded so good but  just a 2.   then shared the thai beef salad!  Fantastic!  Cucumber, shitake mushrooms and tomato with thai chili vinaigrette.   5 stars!!   Entrees were the pan roasted diver sea scallops which i didnt not taste but told they are a 5!   i had filet with mac and cheese.  the mac and cheese being the best i have ever had next to the lobster mac and cheese at Del Friscos.    No dessert! Too full.",

We got fried oysters for an appetizer and they were delicious. I got the pepper crusted filet with goat cheese topping and my boyfriend got the kangaroo. My filet was tasty. A little undercooked but I'd rather it be that way than overcooked. I ordered medium rare and it was more rare. The goat cheese topping was awesome. My side Mac and cheese was a tiny portion but delicious. We weren't a fan of the tandoori seasoning on the kangaroo at all but to each their own. It was a little tough. I've had kangaroo before that was more tender. Our server was nice and attentive and suggested a few good bars around for us to try after.",

    "text": "I was hoping for a bit more from Bernardin's, especially since it is now in the space that once was Ratcliff on the Green, one of my favorite Charlotte restaurants before it closed.  We went during restaurant week at the end of January.  I have found that few restaurants really shine during this week; however, I don't think it should be an excuse for a below-par dining experience   Overall, we had a good time, but there were just too many small things for me to give more than three stars.   1. We asked about a bottle of wine and the waitress simply said she knew nothing about it.  Fine.  I would be really impressed if a waiter knew about every bottle on an extensive list, but I expected she would offer to ask the bar or maitre d'.  First ding.  2. I ordered a salad to start with the dressing explicitely on the side. I can't stand when salad comes drenched in dressing.  The salad came out with the dressing on it. I was looking at it, trying to see if they had overdone it on the dressing.  The waitress realized it was wrong and said \"Oh, they put the dressing on it.  Well, it doesn't look like there is much on there.\"  Then she left the salad on the table.  After a few bites, it was apparent to me that there was just too much dressing on the salad.  The leaves were a bit wilted.  I asked the waitress to bring me a new salad and she did.  It was fine, but she should have done this the first time.   3.  Last criticism-- my cut of salmon was an end piece.  I usually don't expect this of a high quality restaurant like this.  It was a big piece of fish, but the cut really turned me off.  A Fillet from the center looks and tastes better. Besides the fish, the polenta, wilted spinach and sauce underneath were very good.   My date loved his main dish (lamb) and we both enjoyed our desserts.  I think this place has potential; however, for the price point, I would expect better service and presentation.  I really wanted to love it, but I left with a so/so feeling.  Not sure we will be going back when we can go places like Bonterra for the same price range and much better ambiance, execution and creativity.",

The food was unfortunately a disappointment. I had the wedge salad which was fine (hard to mess up). My grouper was OK but I certainly have had better. Two of the group had the scallops which were good by their estimation. I can't remember what one of our guests had but one had the kangaroo (really). He ordered it based on the waiter's recommendation. He had said it was fork tender.  It wasn't. In fact when he brought a BIG steak knife. Chewy, stringy, it just was not something that was worth the hype. Desert was the high lite with the flan.  Our waiter was fine but his focus was on clearing the table between courses. In fact after being stopped once, the second time he actually took a plate before the diner was done. Before we knew it it was gone.  Next time we will try somewhere else.",

I had no expectations at all and did not know much about the place that I have passed by over and over. Boy, wish I had come sooner! The place is cute inside. Its an old building with a semi circle bench up in the front window, a couples table upstairs and just a bunch of regular tables on the main floor. When you walk in, that front area is not the whole restaurant. Dont be thrown! Grab a dirty martini while you wait for your table and get ready to eat.  They bring bread to the table so you can enjoy that with your adult beverage. I ordered the Sweet Garlic Shrimp as my first course and selected the Braised Curried Lamb Shank for my entree. That lamb fell off the bone and was a very generous serving. Everyone at the table tasted it and I was still full. I even took the bone home for my dog! My husband ordered off the regular menu and selected the kangaroo. THAT was awesome. Cant get that everywhere around Charlotte. Try it! My friend got the Pan Roasted Salmon, which was good, he said, but not awesome.  Creme Brulee hit the spot too and a very large sharing portion too.  Good stuff!",

I decided to be a bit adventurous and ordered the Kangaroo. It was delicious, and tasted a lot like beef. We were too full to order desert but did enjoy a bottle of wine from their impressive wine menu. A must try in Charlotte!",

Nicole B had the escargot which I would not taste, and she said they were just ok.  The LUMP CRABCAKES had Black beans, Corn, Chorizo Sausage, cilantro and were good but not great.  The flavors just didn't mesh well with the crab.  We shared a THAI BEEF SALAD with Cucumber, Shitake mushrooms and Tomato with Thai Chili Vinaigrette that was out of this world fantastic!  The meat was rare and melted in our mouths.  I had PAN ROASTED DIVER SEA SCALLOPS Served with Peach Chipotle Vinaigrette and a OvenDried Tomato, asparagus and Shitake mushroom risotto.  I am not a huge fan of risotto, but it was really good and the scallops were cooked perfectly.  Nicole B had a filet, also cooked perfectly with macaroni and cheese.  The mac and cheese was delicious, but nothing can compare to lobster mac at Del Frisco's! We did not make it to dessert even though we tried, the dessert cart looked heavenly! The service was wonderful, the waitress was friendly, fast, and efficient, and offered excellent suggestions.  Glad we stumbled upon Bernardin's!",

The decor is nice but struggles to be upscale in my opinion but immediately I noticed the two best spots to eat.  Front table is great for a group of 6 or more and for a romantic night, the spot at the top of the stairs looked like a perfect place.  I tried the salmon entree and just wasn't in love with it.  I know, salmon can be a little underwhelming in general but this was exceptionally flat for me.  Everything else was spot on, from the waitstaff, bartender and the general experience I had.",

It was an akward set up with some outside seating and a small bar with a few formal tables set in the front, kinda like a fish bowl. The remainder of the restaurant was around this wall. We did not get to sit there and there was still tables open. Only reason I didnt give this place 5 stars.  I ordered the pepper crusted filet minion with spinach and garlic mash potatoes.  Just as a expected, it was excellent! Great portion, very well cooked, nice presentation and incredible taste. We even got a delightful bread with an herb butter for starters.

    "text": "Really a fun restaurant with a fun vibe.  We tried the yummy kangaroo dish and split it between the 5 of us.  Tasted like a pretty tender steak.  I also had the surf and turf which I thought was pretty cheap until I saw the size of the lobster (sort of a big shrimp).  The turf part (filet) was delicious and well seasoned.  ll in all we had a great evening and I would go back.",

    "text": "In a word, it was fine.  I ventured into Bernadin's while on a business trip. it was a toss-up between this place and that trendy new place in the Westin whose name escapes me.   The menu is tempting enough, and it's right in the thick of the uptown (that's downtown to you and me) area.  It was understandably slow as I was there for dinner on the Monday after Easter.  The decor is interesting.  I can't figure out what they're going for: casually elegant? Eclectic Mediterranean?  It's a mystery.  The server was prompt and attentive, so no issues there. Now, onto the food:  I had the Tuna Tuna appetizer, which was tuna served two ways.  One was a tartare that was out of this world.  Really delicious and *very* spicy.  Be ready for that - my eyes were watering.  The other preparation was typical seared tuna, and it was just so-so. I don't think the tuna was particularly high quality which is easier to hide in a tartare than a sear.  If I could have traded in my seared tuna for another helping of the tartare, I would have!       For my entree, I ordered a CAB filet (medium rare) and a side of wilted spinach.   Both were absolutely fine, although the steak didn't wow me.  I needed to add salt  (and there wasn't any on the table - weird).  I ate it all and had no complaints.  Truly a perfectly serviceable steak, but for the price, I was hoping to be wowwed.  Since I was on the company tab, I thought I may as well try dessert. :)  This was another highlight.  I can't remember the exact name of the dish, but it was an apple pie type of thing, and it was delicious.  I should have skipped the entree and ordered two desserts!    I worry that this place doesn't have enough punch to compete in an increasingly crowded uptown dining scene, but I would definitely give it another shot after I've tried out the other places.  The place is fairly new from what I can gather, so it can still cash in on that mystique.",

It was delicious.  My server did a great job of describing the drinks as well as the food so as to recommend without actually recommending anything. He did an amazing job. It was a very enjoyable experience worth coming back for more.",
