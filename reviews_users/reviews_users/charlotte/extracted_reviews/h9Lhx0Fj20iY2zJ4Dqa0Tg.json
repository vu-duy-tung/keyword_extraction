The longest that I have waited for a Farley's delivery was one hour and 45 minutes. The food I ordered was stone cold. (I live about 5 minutes away)  This place is a little bit more expensive than others. Don't be a sucker, Avoid this place entirely!",

So my family and I ordered 2-20 pieces.  Hot.  Honey barbeque. Garlic parmesan.  All cooked extra crispy.  I had the hot and honey barbeque.  So good to me!  On the flyer the front desk provided, it said free 10 inch pizza with purchase of $12 or more.  Although it had no expiration, they honored it and said just give it to my delivery person - which I did. I got half pepperoni/half sausage.  It is a pretty thin crust.  No problem for me.  I love thin crust, so that was cool.  My fav pizza is pepperoni.  However, surprisingly, although the pepperoni was great, I actually loved the sausage better!  Great experience and the ETA on the delivery time was accurate.  Seems it was a little earlier than expected. Ordered last night (Sat July 1st).  If in the area again, and want pizza/wings, I will remember them!",

Their personal 10\" cheese pizza was as good as it gets. Great sauce! Nice thin & crispy crust, with just the right amount of grease. :-) The 10\" size was plenty for my daughter and I, and it was about $8 for the pizza and a drink, including tax. That's better than most anywhere in expensive Ballantyne, for sure. We're big Hawthornes Pizza fans -  and still will be - but this place will give Hawthornes a run for their money in my book.

The last 6 or 7 times we've ordered, the pizza has been so soggy  that when you pick up a piece it brakes off into a pile of mush halfway up.  This last order was the last straw.  We got some wings with our pizza and when we came to pick them up, the B team was clearly on duty.  Nobody had on gloves while preparing food, or any head coverings and I heard them say redrop those wings to get them crispy .  Someone even remarked that they'd been out and sitting in the basket for quite a while.  Needless to say and as luck would have it, those were our wings.  Not only did they taste funny and had a rubbery texture, both of us got food poisoning which the doctor told us was linked to chicken.  Funny how that was the only chicken we ate and the timing matched up perfectly .  No thanks never again.  I'll take the weekly order for pizza night elsewhere from now on.",

Shortly after writing my review below I received a call from one of the owners, John and he let me know I'd have a credit on my account to try them again. They just delivered our food and I have to say it is delicious! I'm very picky about my wings, and they are so good!   Thank you to John, and the great delivery drive Lavon (may be spelling it wrong) for your great service. We will most definitely continue to order from you!  First review: Ordered delivery from them last night and it was ok. First off, I hate pizza being cut in squares, but I'm somewhat used to it as that's what a majority of pizza places did when I lived in Minnesota.  Second, it just didn't taste great. I'm willing to give them another shot, but I'll probably try the wings next time.",

I let them know about it that day and they offered to remake our order next time around......  But when that next time came, they couldn't find the notes from the bad delivery. They did look up my last order and offered to remake one item over and said I should speak to the other manager who may have a record of the issue. I thought it was bad they they didn't have a better system, but oh well.  This last time, I placed a phone pickup order on my way home because I knew I had to stop at the nearby grocery store and wanted food ready when I arrived. I was told 10-15 minutes. I arrived 14 minutes after my call and was told \"we are putting it in the oven now\". Ugh....... One if the things I got from the grocery store was ice cream.  Not happy.....   Well less than 10 minutes later, my order was done, so it wasn't too bad. Just seems I always have an issue there lately.   The pizza is good when things go right though, it's just the process that needs to be ironed out.",

The gentleman who brought our plates and silverware was very attentive. The restaurant was clean and very organized. They were pretty busy, lots of deliveries orders.  We didn't have to wait more than 14 minutes for our pizza to be brought to our table. It was delicious, the crust was perfect, pizza and ham were super fresh. Love the drizzle of honey, it brought the whole pizza together.  Our family will definitely go back and try another item from their menu.",

Apparently they gave my wings to someone else inexplicably and now I wait while they start over.  On top of this, they were going to give me the same pizza that was ready 25 minutes ago, until I told them I would not accept an old pizza since the wing fiasco was entirely their screw up.    Thought it would be pretty obvious to them to make a new pizza instead of trying to skip the old one by me, but guess this speaks to the commitment to customer service or lack thereof.    Comedy of errors on so many levels but at least the manager was willing to take off the charge for the wings, but guess that isn't saying much given that it has now been 48 minutes and counting since our order was placed...49....50...51...wait here it is...it's like the Charlie Brown Christmas miracle!  On the bright side, the manager did end up comping the meal so at least I didn't pay for this fiasco.",

    "text": "When we first discovered Farley's a couple years ago the place was delivery pizza perfection. After a while we became extremely disappointed that our orders kept coming over cooked like dark brown over cooked, we had to find another option and we did.  I ordered several for a kid birthday party and even the kids wouldn't eat it.  Some time has passed and I thought maybe they are under new mngmt or have new pizza chefs.  As a caution for my wallet, I wrote in the notes \"Please do not overcook\" on notes section for both pizzas.  They were delivered on time and were delicious, perfect pizzas.  My second order since then I wrote the same note on one pizza but not the kids pizza.  Result, my pizza was absolutely perfect, the kids pizza was delivered overcooked.  If Farley's would stop sending pizza out with burned mozzarella, this place would have 5 stars on here I have no doubt.  The ingredients they use are great, the crust is great.. you can only tell this when not served completely over done...  I hope Farley's owner see's this bc this is about as honest as a review can get.  Giving 4 stars bc we really, really enjoy the pizza when not overcooked.  I would give 5 if I didn't have to ask for it not overcooked.  Also, please tell the pizza chefs thank you for reading my request in the note section and sending out perfect pizza!  They deserve a pay raise :-)",

I was upset and asking the young man at the counter why let them take it when I said I was on my way to get it. Well the manager made us a fresh pie and calzone, free of charge.

They delivered when the chains could not and they are our favorite place now! Where can I start? I am not a huge fan of wings, but I can order them extra crispy and with extra home made sauce. My husband orders the flats (huge feature) with a new flavor every week!   Try the hot teriyaki and the hot if you like them hot!   The appetizer pizza roll is like a New York Stromboli from where we are from-better than expected and perfect!

And there is basically NO sauce on the pizza. So it's more like eating flat cheesy bread. I ordered hand tossed crust, and it's extremely thin. So I can't imagine how thin the thin crust must be.
