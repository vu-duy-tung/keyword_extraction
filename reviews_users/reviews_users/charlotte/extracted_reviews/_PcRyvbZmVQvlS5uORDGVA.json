    "text": "We were a party of 4 in town for a concert. We selected this spot as it had a minimal wait time. We all ordered 2 burgers (the California and the Carolina), fish filet sandwich, and a firecracker chicken sandwich. The burgers were decent . Certainly not the best nor so good we would think of this spot as the go-to place for a burger. The fish filet was thin, as well as, the chicken on the other sandwich. My friend actually sent her chicken back as it was all bread. One of the plates we paid extra for onion rings which the kitchen didn't get right, but the waitress quickly remedied that. We had ordered an appetizer, but it never came and the waitress didn't even notice. I had to suggest to her that it be taken off the bill as it didn't arrive. We felt neglected by our waitress. My impression was that management had given her too many tables as she always seemed busy.",

It was moderately busy & they seemed to have plenty of staff - who I watched congregating at the kitchen service window most of the time. It took nearly 10 minutes to be acknowledged by a server - who was nice on the rare occasion we saw her. We got our food & never saw her again (because she was chatting at the kitchen window) until we had to ask for our check.   The most appalling was the person at the dessert counter answered the phone & she mentioned to who appeared to be the  manager that they person on the phone wanted to speak to a manager. The woman waved her off & said I'm not dealing with anyone right now. We were sitting 5 feet from her so it was clear what she said despite the music playing. Sad, really because the food was good & given the location in Epicenter is a nice location - but it will be scratched off our list for sure.",

It was a 6 o'clock on a Saturday and there was not a wait line. Our friend had ordered a BLT sandwich and asked to sub the French fries for hash browns. Once the food came out, we had started eating then the waitress realized our friend had not gotten the hash browns she had ordered. (7 minutes later) She simply apologized and went to the back, to come back with a Togo box asking our friend to scoop the fries in the box with her hands. Honestly it would not have been a big deal to us, but after waiting for so long for her to fix her mistake and making the absolute unordinary decision about it, we will actually re think about ever going back.",

    "text": "Decided to try Redeye, since I had been to Midnight Diner twice and wanted to see how they compared. The similarities were obvious--as were the differences. I will say upfront that Midnight is the winner of the coin toss, however I can't fail to mention what the Redeye staff did to meet my special request about my biscuit (read on). Oh, and after walking in it took me about 2 minutes after I was seated to go to Google to find out if the two were related through ownership. The answer: Yes, they are.  First, the decor: this is a different place. It is a relatively new in-city space: larger, more modern and without some of the \"diner\" feel of Midnight. That's OK: it couldn't be the same given it's location and new construction. However, if you want more of the True diner experience, then Midnight wins in that regard.  Now, the food: I did a bit more reaching for the unusual at Midnight, and got the Bubba (more about that on the review I posted with pictures). I was more restrained here, if you can call this restrained: a veggie omelette (hold the cheese), the livermush (my new favorite Southern version of scrapple), hash browns (a large serving, however very much (literally) within the lines of a rectangle, not the kind you get at Waffle House which is free form on the griddle), and a homemade biscuit. (By the way, we like to taste foods, not consume large quantities so we order what we want, eat a bit of the heavier stuff, and take the to-go box. It seems to work--at least most of the time).  Ah, the biscuit: I didn't want butter. OK... at most places, they take the biscuit, put some butter on it and hit the grill for a short time to warm it up. At Redeye, they apparently are home made from scratch, then have butter put on them at the time of cooking, so getting a biscuit without butter is a challenge. Their response? They put an entire pan of biscuits in the oven for me--without the butter--to serve me my delicious, crumbly home made biscuit. And, to boot, one of the managers came out to let me know they were working on my request. I was floored--and maybe a bit embarrassed to have them go through all of that trouble. Duly noted!!!  Now, the service: Cameron was great. However, this was the morning of the Komen race, so it probably is an unfair comparison: it seemed like the place was a bit overwhelmed. I suspect today is not a fair comparison, however coffee was late at several tables who shared their experience with each other. Like I said, they were busy, busy, busy--and this is probably not a typical Saturday morning.  All in all: good food, great menu, reasonable prices and variety to fit almost anyone's palate. Recommended, and I'd go again without hesitation.",

We waited and waited and no one came to say Sorry there was a mistake and it will take a little longer for your food. Instead they tried to cover the mistake like the food just took a little longer. I watched the manager get informed about the situation and I think it's really poor customer service that she didn't come apologize to our table. Needless to say we were charged for both and never offer an apology for it taking so long. The food is subpar, basic diner food.",

I will note that it was definitely strange to be there on a Monday around 10am - we had seen a concert in town the night before.  The menu is huge and had lots of selection, all reasonably priced and better yet (one of my FAVORITE things on a menu) they marked Redeye Diner recommendations! So I don't have to ask the waiter! I ended up with the Biscuits and Gravy special which was two huge biscuits covered with scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, and so much sausage gravy!! I cannot explain how delicious it was, I don't normally go for a breakfast this large but it was definitely worth it.   The staff and space was interesting, decked out in 50s decor and definitely kept up with the diner theme. I definetly wouldn't go back for the service, staff, or enviornemnt but I would go back for the food!",

The restaurant did not seem too busy at the time, and there was one person ahead of me waiting to be seated. There are open tables and seating available at the bar, but the waiter came to me only after 5 minutes, which is still fine. I sat at a small table and waited for 10 more minutes for somebody to take my order. Finally, a server came by to clean the adjacent table, and asked if I've been assisted already. I said no, so he took my order. He was short with me, but I didn't bother that either. After more than 20 minutes of waiting (all I ordered was two eggs, two buttermilk pancakes and grits), I noticed that other guests who had come after I did, and placed their orders later, got their food. I asked a waitress if she could check on my food as it had been a while. She shrugged and asked, \"Well, who's your server?\" I described to her, and in the meantime my server brought my food. I was happy finally I got my food, but the waiter again was short perhaps because I asked for my food, and asked, \"Want me to get your check if you are in a hurry?\" I was surprised, and said sure. As the waiter left, the elderly man sitting opposite me on a different table, frowned and shook his head. I enjoyed my cold food because I was hungry, but I wouldn't go back. The waiter came by later to pick-up my card and said, \"Sorry for the delay in bringing your food, man. There is shift change happening now.\"",

    "text": "My coworkers and I came in for lunch on Friday. To start off there were 10 of us, which we knew would be a hard task to seat together and even if we did sit together it would be very hard to eat and leave within the hour break. When we talked to the host about splitting up she took on the challenge of making a section fit so we could all stay together within a blink of an eye! Props to the host for thinking on her feet!  However, I would like to shout out our waitress, Cat, for absolutely amazing when it came to time and efficiency. Clearly lunch time is busy and I know it doesn't make it much easier when you have two 10 tops plus other tables you have to take care of. But Cat was very fast from beginning to end. Our table did not half to wait on her at all. On top of her being fast all of our food came out perfect. No hiccups, no forgotten sauces, no empty cups needing refills,  everything was on point. When it came to cashing out I noticed that she had another 10 top sending all their food back and just being all around rude to her. I saw the manager come talk to the table and it was obvious that our waitress had her hands full with the complaining table. Like I said before, Cat was a boss when it came to her waitressing skills. even though the other table was being complete jerks she still managed to handle them as well as cash out three other tables in a timely manner including our group.   So Cat if you get a chance to read this.. YOU ROCK! thanks for being awesome and nice! Sorry that other table did you like that.   Also for the manager that was doing the food ( girl with brown hair and glasses and pink shirt) you my friend need to be nicer. clearly if none of her other tables complained and everyone's food came out perfect except this one table... do you really honestly think it was the waitresses fault ? probably not. In addition, being mean or catching an attitude to your coworkers will not make them work better. Maybe you should try to understand and help fix the situation instead of adding more fuel to the fire.   Good food, great service!",

We ended up arriving in town late and arrived around 1am and were immediately seated.  The Diner is in a multi-floor strip mall on the bottom level.  There were a lot of party goers ending their night which was noticeable but was not a problem.  We tried the chicken and waffles which came with 3 HUGE wings, we tried the quarter dark chicken with broccoli and mac and cheese, and the Philly Cheese steak. We all tasted portions of all and found them all to be very pleasing.  The quarter chicken, leg and thigh did not appear to be as fresh as the wings.  They were fine but were obviously not recently prepared as if they had been sitting waiting to be served for some time.  The Philly was great along with the wings and waffle.  We discussed coming back before we left but time did not permit.  We would recommend this Diner.",

The chicken was hard to take off the bone and onions rings were cold.",

Sat at the end of the counter where we watched every server dip cups into the ice bin with their hands while the ice scoop sat like an ornament in a bin on the side.  The manager even did the same dragging the keys on her wrist through the ice as well.  Got my BLT with exactly two pieces of bacon on it and a bunch of shredded lettuce.  The fries came out like they had been in the fryer for thirty seconds,  they were pale and cold in the middle.  I won't be coming back.",

The grapevine says this place is owned by the owners of Midnight Diner, and I agree based on the grits. Anyway back to the diner! The diner is like a flash back in time to an old school soda shop! But the menu - AMAZING! From spaghetti, to burgers, to wings, to fried chicken they don't get anything wrong. While in town for CIAA weekend, my group and I are at Redeye two days in a row- and there were no complaints, which is hard for a group of girls who can be picky and are trying to keep the bloat down to look our best while enjoying the weekend. Needless to say, great food has a way of making you forget about bloating so fried chicken, waffles, omelettes, grits, Mac and cheese and teriyaki wings were ordered more than we may admit. And- for those looking for a sprinkle of health- i did have a side salad which was a great size and delicious! And the homemade ranch will change your life. Overall, for a great price and a large amount of bang for your buck - THIS IS THE PLACE! Oh and the staff is really attentive and ready to help in any way!",

Buen provecho!",

Overall, the food was good but not great.  I ordered a good corned beef hash.  The eggs were a bit oily, but the biscuit was solid.  The Hasbbrowns (with onions) were greasy, but somewhat flavorful.  The pancakes were thick and heavy, if that's your thing.  The disappointments were the syrup (gooey and gross) and the coffee (bad tasting).  I was torn between this and 3 stars, but the hash and the other food on the table was OK.  It's worth noting that a southerner in our group said the gravy was just mediocre.  I'll gift this 4 stars, but probably won't go back.",

The shrimp and grits were okay. I had the fried chicken wings and French toast (substitute to the waffle). I though it was good. The server was nice. You can keep the party going after tour late night here because they have alcoholic beverages.  The prices are reasonable. They give a check in offer for yelp, but I couldn't get the WiFi working right with my phone. Maybe you will have better luck. So if your looking for comfort food this is your spot.",

My style of eating constantly changes, extreme foodie here so sometimes it gets difficult to eat out . I want real butter on my food , none of that clarified stuff , but I didn't come to Red eye to feast on decadent bacon or buttery waffles .    First impression , BUSY ... I'm assuming due to the location. We were seated in a nice size booth and our waitress , she was phenomenal.  I can't remember how much I asked her to do , do you have heavy whipping cream , can we get extra straws, do you have splenda I don't like equal , etc. but she kept such a pleasant and joyful attitude .   On to the food , that's what we are mainly here for right? Mmmmmm , anything with eggs and avacodo is a win for me . The San Bernadarino  omelet with chicken was just the right size and no hidden pancake mix in the preparation to make it super fluffy , for my carb conscious eaters .  I got my order with a side of fruit, which was fresh and plentiful.  We got our lil one the kids breakfast special, pancake ( it was massive) with one egg and a meat of your choice .  $6 for that kids plate, I'll probably get that myself one day .   What made me give 4stars is there were no compliments about the food from anyone in my family , the service was fast and friendly , the atmosphere was a great mixture, and I saw more menu items I would love to try .",

Everyone greeted me with a smile and I knew I came to the right spot. MALCOLM was my server on both days and I truly enjoyed his energy. He made sure we were well taken care of and carried a great convo. He also directed me to a local souvenir shop where I can buy some things to take back home to Orlando.

Probably one of the most horrible customer experiences in my life at a restaurant and we didn't even stay for the food.  Went there on a Weekday around 6pm - only two other booths had customers.  Sat down, ordered 4 drinks.  Husband and I ordered jack and diets and our friends ordered two beers.  Waitress comes back and says they don't have jack and diets so I suggest makers but she says they don't have that either.  Then another lady comes and says oh yea, we have makers, so then they bring us our drinks.  Immediately upon sipping, I knew the liquor was not whiskey.  My husband figures out its rum because he hates rum so we ask to send it back and order something else.  Waitress disappears, comes back, says its policy that once the drink is poured, it's charged.  My husband and I both immediately are like, lemme speak to the manager.  Manager comes over and gives us the same fkn spiel.  We're livid at this point and demand they close out the tab so she's like.. Ok I'll make an exception and repair the drinks.  We go to the bar to see what liquors they have.  Turns out they don't have ANY whiskey so there's no way they could have served us what we ordered.  At that point we closed out cuz we had made enough of a scene that I was convinced if we stayed, they'd spit in our food (or worse).  Upon leaving one of our friends said they brought him the wrong beer.  I'm convinced that bc there used to serving drunk people out on the town in epicenter that they thought they could pull one over on us by serving us some gut-lining-remover rum and charge us for makers.  That or they're extraordinarily liquor dumb.  So in summary, 3/4 drink orders were wrong and apparently their customer policy is to charge the customer for the business's mistakes.   Shittiest. Customer service.  Ever.  Don't support this business.",

This place is massive folks! The host could have been a little more friendlier but I went straight to the bar anyways. I am not sure where they found their bartender Mich but she is utterly breath taking and definitely made my second trip worth while. Very personable, food came out super quick, she was running circles around some of the other staff! Ive had friends say service is hit or miss here but I cant complain!   I will be back to try the infamous Shrimp and Grits for sure as well as the scenery behind their bar!",

I've told everyone that listens, \"Redeye has the best grits in Charlotte\". Native to Central Illinois, grits is a dietary staple the past 27 years, ha! Breakfast, burgers, shrimp & grits, fried chicken, fish, you name it, Redeye covers it with quality good, good friendly service and reasonable diner pricing.",

The place is set up like an old school diner, which was really cute. We sat at the bar and ordered a milkshake with two slices of cake a piece. The cake was amazing! It was sweet and delicious. My friend said the milkshake was just as good. You get huge serving which is great for leftovers! Definitely will be back and highly recommend!",

We tried probably 5 places including Soul Gastrolounge, Landmark Diner and didn't like that line at Benny Pennelo's (or the attitude from employees).  The Epicenter area was still very busy. So there's a bouncer at Redeye? I don't know whether to feel secure or scared. Do you need a bouncer and if so why? Moving on.  We only had to wait a couple of minutes before being let in - there were plenty of empty tables and counter space though.  Our waiter was nice enough - the prices were good - the food was good - the service okay. My Bacon Cheeseburger was just what I needed and John H. reported his eggs and corned beef hash fit the bill as well.  The jukebox however was way too loud - not sure I like having my eardrums and my intestines jostled by sound waves while trying to eat.  Overall an okay place to get a late night bit to eat when all others close their kitchens by 10-11PM.",

I've been to Redeye many times and I always get the shrimp and grits. It's just that good!  The Pros - More space than most well known diners in CLT - Very clean. Ironically, I can appreciate the subtle smell of chlorine bleach in this place. - Fast and friendly service (most nights) - Great variety on menu   Cons - Late nights after nightclubs let out = long lines outside and pushy security  - Not easily accessible. Must park in the parking deck because valet is ALWAYS congested",

I ate The Bubba, an upgraded version of biscuits with sausage gravy. Super tastey and filling.  Usually made with scrambled eggs on top but I changed it up to a sunny side egg to have extra richness to the biscuits and gravy dish.   Overall good diner food, and Patrick made it a great experience.",

And they're a diner - and almost all diners are good, right? Wrong. Unfortunately the food is awful - even when you're drunk! I came here with my friends and fiance after going out in Epicentre one night and we were all very unimpressed. There was a wait to get in, so we patiently waited until a table opened up. And after eating I'm not sure why so many people would wait around for this. I would have rather went home and cooked myself or walked a couple of blocks and grabbed a slice of pizza from fuel.",

The shrimp were very tiny and not many of them but what was there was tasty.  The music was up way too loud and it was blaring a very distasteful nightclub type music- not appropriate for a family friendly diner atmosphere. Came back and tried breakfast food. Had the grits again, which were wonderful. We were seated near the kitchen and the cooks and expediter were communicating loudly- they need to be quieter to maintain a relaxed environment. This place can be a real gem if they work out the kinks in making the diners feel comfortable.",

Obviously I am still dreaming of it...everything else was fine. The service was great and friendly, my sides were good/average, the coffee was strong and the place was super clean. I think we got there before the Sunday rush, so maybe the bad service reviews are when they're super busy or something? Overall I would for sure go back.",

One would think this obvious. Listening to the apparent manager lecture the hostess not to seat anyone, it's VERY clear he doesn't understand. Came for the crunchy French toast.

When I tasted it I quickly asked did they put Italian dressing on it. The waitress goes to the kitchen comes back out and said no it doesn't have any dressing I have to get it for you. After giving me the dressing she asked if it tasted better. I told her no. She goes to the kitchen again and comes back and says it was tossed with oil and vinegar which I couldn't understand why. Anyway Manager comes out apologies for food agrees with me that the taste was not right and explains the mistake made by the kitchen (it was tossed with Italian dressing). He agrees to comp my semi eaten salad. As I go to leave the waitress has the audacity to say so I don't get a tip. I continued walking, but then decided she was right. I went back in and gave the manager a dollar and said tell her great job she just bought a customer. By the way the honey cheesy bread tasted amazing too bad I won't be eating it anymore. Sidenote: This isn't my first complaint with the diner just the one I felt needed to be heard.",

The RedEye Is in the EpiCenter which makes it very convenient to the Spectrum and many of the downtown hotels.  Prices are very reasonable considering the location.  My wife had a really nice Greek Salad with Grilled chicken added I had the Philly Chesesteak with fries.  Both were very good, prepared quickly and our server was attentive with drink refills etc.  We were pleased and decided to go back for breakfast.   Just fruit for my wife, I had the Eggs and Corn-beef hash.  I wasn't asked how I wanted my egg so they can scrambled, I guess that was sort of my fault, hash browns were not included, the waitress didn't ask either, I ordered the muffin and had to remind the waitress as it didn't come with my rather plain looking breakfast plate.  No real milk or half and half only liquid Coffee Mate was available.  Coffee refills were adequate.    The place is clean, the 50-60s music is fun.  Being a Jersey guy I'm really spoiled by great diners.  We would go again.  I'd try the pancakes next time.",

The sausage was a bit dry while the rest of my food was somewhat cold, and I think the strawberries should of been on top instead of the side. The hash browns was a bit greasy but edible. I enjoyed it and was fulfilling before my flight back to NY. I'm sure after the clubs that they have in the area it's a great place to eat.

We stopped by to a half empty establishment around 7pm on a Saturday night. There was no one around to seat anyone so we had an awkward wait right up front trying to decide if we wanted to stay or go somewhere else. An unhappy hostess asked how many and showed us to a large booth to the back where we proceeded to wait almost ten minutes until a manager asked if we had been served. She went and found us a waiter and we promptly ordered.  The best dish of the night was the appetizer of firecracker shrimp. Not spicy as anticipated but delicious sauce. I ordered the California Burger \"well done\" to which the waiter told me all the burgers are cooked well done. Great! He disappeared for a bit and came back with our burgers and then later with our appetizer.   Now my burger was okay until I got to the middle and found pink. Esh. Waiter was nowhere in sight to point this out to so I ate my waffle fries and continued enjoying the company I was out with. Getting the check was a task.   All said the three of us were there over an hour and a half when it was not busy for mediocre food. I will say the prices were cheap considering we were in the Epicentre but it's definitely not somewhere I would seek to eat at again.",

Not to sound morbid or anything, but just imagine it. Imagine your life, flashing before your eyes. All the beautiful memories, the laughter, all the friends you had, a life full of enjoyment. And that's just the first bite.  Seriously, if you live in Charlotte and haven't been here yet, you're doing yourself a serious diservice. Everything looks fantastic and it is c-h-e-a-p!

Made the mistake of trying to get in the morning of The Belk Bowl football game! Big mistake. Long wait, but we held out until we got seated. there was another pretty long wait to get waited on and yet another to get served.  I don't think it's lack of servers. The place was crawling with uniformed diner staff and frankly everyone looked to be working very fast, but were they efficient? our food was served hot. We had a standard breakfast of sorts, eggs, toast, grits, etc. The coffee was OK, but not great. Seemed fresh brewed. I might try it again in the future, but I suspect there are other good breakfast joints near downtown.",

We had a party of five on a Friday night, about 11 pm and the place was slightly busy.The diner is surprisingly large with ample seating. The menu has plenty of dish selections without overwhelming you with an encyclopedia of options. The service was good enough to be engaging but not overbearing or extra. Pancakes were huge and I highly recommend the grits. These grits weren't that bullshit watered down style grits...no no no! They were thick and creamy based with just enough salt. I got cheese with my grits but next time I won't because the grits are GOOD MONEY by themselves w/ out adding cheese...but if you do add it I can't fault you.  My only knock on Redeye is the pricing. Not that the prices were crazy extreme or anything like that. I guess I'm used to diners being a little more price friendly. I have been to several other comparable diners in Charlotte where the price of the food is better. But then in hindsight you have to take in consideration that Redeye is located practically in the heart of uptown Charlotte.",

We stopped here on a Saturday morning after the Charlotte Heart Walk. The place is much bigger than it appears from the outside and also appeared clean with a sanitation grade of 96. Photos and memorabilia of rock and country music stars adorn the walls to give it a True diner atmosphere.  We were seated fairly promptly although it was a little busy because of the walk. Our waiter was prompt and helpful with service, and even sometimes a little too quick. I had an egg and cheese biscuit and the biscuit was perfect - most and fluffy and fell apart. The hashbrowns were also good with the right amount of crispiness. Egg-white omelette was also good despite the canned mushrooms they use.  Prices were fair for most items except the egg-white omelette, which was almost $13 (regular omelettes are cheaper). Most breakfast items were comparable to other diner places. They also have full entries such as steak and fried seafood. Overall, a good experience and I would go back.",

Redeye Diner's servers really are dedicated to serving their customers. I am always warmly greeted upon entrance, and the servers personalities are allowed to shine.  The only issue with Redeye Diner is that EpiCenter parking is so expensive that I don't get to hang out and drink bottomless coffee as long as I would like. I wish EpiCenter had some sort of ticket validation program.  Regardless, I will be back...the chicken & waffles (or french toast) are some of the best the Queen City has to offer!",

I was a little surprised that this all came out to like $30 including the tip (I did add two extra biscuits just in case my children were ravenous). But technically for 3 people that isn't horrible. It is just that three people shared one meal.  I will say that the staff is very casual in their dealings with the customers but still very friendly. I would definitely eat here again.

Everything about this place screams family and late night/early afternoon lunch with friends.  Just a few things that I would like to point out, not sure if this is the normal for this restaurant, but business was slow and my waitress was a little slow with assistance. Placed my order and my food was ready within a few minutes of me placing my order. My burger was great but I wasn't really digging my fries much because a lot of them were to crispy or hard to eat... And I don't like crispy ass fries! But needless to say, it was a good deal and I enjoyed every minute of it. I would recommend anyone to come and be apart of the Redeye Diner experience and get a feel for the blast from the past. Tell your friends or relatives and make a trip to an epic night at the Epicenter's Redeye Diner.",

It was busy with a short wait but it is a Saturday night.  The service was ok but nothing worth raving about and most staff seemed to look past you. I sat at the counter and the young female server was friendly and helpful but also filling drink orders as they came in.  The food.. well.. disappointing. The house salad was well and Truely pre-prepared and average in taste and presentation served on a really cold plate giving away it's prepared earlier in the day and sitting in the fridge status. I had the Lee's Special fried chicken and fries too. The fries were 'fresh' cut and relatively tasteless along with the chicken. Whilst the chicken was fresh tasting the coating was average and nothing new.  Overall I would certainly try alternatives around the city before here.I was definitely looking forward to eating here after hearing good things about it but sadly was ordinary.",

Everything here is basically less than $10. The drinks are amazing btw, come here not for the food but for the drink specials.  I never thought I'd go to a diner and sit at their bar, but their two $5 drink specials are ones you can't miss. A tall glass of a cocktail of spirits that usually tastes fruity but alcoholic, and delicious.

I attached the description of the meal that was so unclear (the redeye special). Two members of our party were under the same impression as I was.

If your computers are down, advise customers at the door, so we can make a decision on whether we wish to sit and wait or not.  2. If your computers are down, that should NEVER stop the ordering or paying for food!! Servers can write the order and get a manager to walk it back to the kitchen. Advise customers you can only accept cash at that time (I doubt any one will leave their cc information with staff in this day and age).  3. If you have customers in the restaurant when the computers go down, and the wait is more than 5 minutes, have the manager go to each table and apologize for the inconvenience. That simple act goes a long way (unless you don't care about repeat customers). Maybe even offer a free beverage.  There are other things I could mention, but this is a start. Hopefully, it's helpful.",

I am not one that needs pleasantries from the waitstaff - just get my order right, don't make me wait too long (without acknowledgement), ask me if I need anything once or twice, and give me an accurate bill!  In short, the waitress/manager met my requirements.  We both ordered the shrimp and grits...  OMG, I don't think I ever had grits that good in my life!!!  Very creamy!  The shrimp was plump and not overcooked.  Sadly, I could not eat the biscuit that went along with it - too full from the grits - lol.  I visit Charlotte often so I will definitely come back (if only to try the fried chicken and waffles or the shakes, which I scoped while waiting for my order).    I am surprised by all the bad reviews, but I have a pragmatists view when it comes to 24 hour diners in general, the quality (sadly) is sometimes contingent on time that you go (we went in the late afternoon when it was not too crowded).",

Admit that the gravy is what it is and don't just say \"no spice, you got it\" and when I come to get my call in order and ASK if it was made with no spice, don't say \"no spice, just like you asked\". For the love of Mike, I could hardly eat the blasted thing!!  If the sauce is unchangeable SAY THAT, I would have ordered something else. Also I ordered a slice of chocolate cake, last time I got it the cake itself had been sliced at some earlier point, so one side was all crunchy crumbs...same thing this time, it's a pretty pricey slice of cake COVER THE CUT EDGE and please give me my whole slice next time. *see photo",

I ordered a hamburger, medium, only to be told it was not available. \"We only cook our burgers well done.\" Strike 2. Then Waffle fries arrived cold. Strike 3. To top it off,  when my friend gave waitress $20 bill to pay her $10.40 ticket, she returned with $9, no change. She assumed the change was hers to keep, and I guess she was right because that's the tip she got for being so presumptuous. 4 strikes and your out, Red Bird Diner.",

I was thinking I would just get a burger. I went through the menu, and decided on the fried chicken.  The description sounded good, and my server said she ate that dish all the time. 1/4 dark with a biscuit and 2 sides. $9.99.  Sold.  For my two sides, I opted for collard greens and onion rings.  The chicken was indeed crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It tasted hot and fresh. Better than I've had most recently elsewhere. They fried it well because it was not dripping in grease. I usually love collard greens, but this was just ok.  As for the onion rings, they were excellent as well. Usually restaurant onion rings have a weird crust that is like corn meal and betray the fact that they came in a giant 50-lb. frozen bag. Not here, the crust had the texture of fresh batter. I can't guarantee that; it just tasted good. The onion inside was also natural tasting. If you're a fan of onion-rings, it's easy to tell good from bad.  All in all, the food was good. Service was quick and friendly.",

My husband ordered fried chicken. It was delicious.The food came out within a reasonable time but mine was cold so it was sent back. I waited along time before the pancakes came back.

I did enjoy going to this location because I have gone to the other location many times and it was good to get a change of setting. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and answered the questions that my drunk friend had even though she has been to Midnight Diner hundreds of times. They were nice enough to turn the channel on the TV for us to watch a basketball game. The food could have been a little more flavorful but overall I still enjoyed our visit and I will definitely be going back. I can't remember which day of the week we went but there was no wait. I have passed by before on the weekends and seen a line forming outside during peak hours.",

Place was clean and the waitress seated me immediately but then seemed to forget about me after I told her it was my first time and I needed more time with the menu. Honestly, it's a larger, commercial style diner so they probably go through a lot of different servers frequently so I would take any service ratings with a grain of salt as it is likely to change month to month. She was friendly though.  Food came out promptly. I've never had shrimp and grits before but it was very flavor and delicious. The milkshake though tasted extremely bland and almost more like butter or cream than actually being sweet. I've had a lot of different milkshakes from different places but I would say that this was definitely the worst milkshake I've ever had, I didn't even finish it, and I always finish my drinks as a matter of principle. It's a shame cause it comes in a glass than a refill tin.   Milkshake aside I would definitely try this place again.  Milkshake aside I say the food was worth trying.",

We ordered a fried shrimp platter, with a side of mash potatoes and a biscuit, philly cheesesteak, pimento burger special with bacon, a kids chicken tenders and fries, and a kids meal burger and fries.  All the food was delicious but the only thing is my daughter didn't like the biscuit that came with her shrimp platter, she said it was very dry.  But hey, drown it in butter and problem solved.  I had the daily special listed on the chalkboard outside and that was the Pimento Cheese and Bacon Burger and it was sooooo sooooo sooooo sooooo good and the fries that came with it took it over the top. I really do hope they put it permanently on their menu because I am hooked. This place is a solid and very reliable place to get some good grub. I'm sold!  That is all!",

    "text": "For our big group of 8, the menu variety at Redeye was perfect for us and everyone found something to suit their tastes. The fried chicken was definitely the highlight -- crispy and golden brown but not at all greasy. As half of our table ordered chicken, our server told us the kitchen was going to make it fresh for us, which we appreciated though it did add to our wait time for food.   The one letdown though was the mac and cheese, which is a favorite for me. Oily, over-cooked noodles with dried cheese clumps is not what I was hoping for when the server said they're \"known for our mac and cheese.\" I'd definitely suggest choosing one of other sides, of which there's plenty more options.",

    "text": "FIRST THINGS FIRST: TRY THEIR CREAMY GRITS! This is 100% honest and not exaggerated: their grits are the best grits I've ever tasted in my life. It is super creamy with a hint of corn and is the perfect texture. Maybe I was just super hungry at the time but I swear they really are THAT GOOD. My dinner date ordered The \"Bubba\" ($10.99) which came with the grits and I ordered the Redeye Signature Steakburger... honestly we were both going for the grits the entire time because they were that amazing. And it's only a smallish cup that comes on the side of The \"Bubba.\"   Aside from the creamy grits, my dinner date thought that the eggs in The \"Bubba\" were slightly over cooked and that the biscuits were good but just decent/average. My steakburger was very delicious and cooked to a very nice crisp with very good flavor from their special \"secret\" sauce. For $7.49 it was a super cheap for how good the burger was.   Overall, the Redeye Diner serves hearty and good food with a very nice atmosphere/vibe that replicates a 60s diner. The service can be slow at times just because it seems busy at all hours of the night since it is in the epicenter. I'm definitely coming back to try more items on their menu specifically the shakes and deserts (I saw lots of people eating only their deserts so it must be good). Again, if you stop by NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, try their creamy grits (they're $3 bucks as a side order)!",

I was super excited to see they had the coconut flake French toast, but disappointed that I couldn't get a full order (4 pieces) with the meal. I settled for the half order of coconut flakes French toast with turkey sausage patties, over easy eggs and hash browns. I also shared a plate of waffle fries with my friends an trust me- they're nowhere near as good as CFA's waffle fries LOL.  It was a pretty basic meal & the server wasn't as friendly as the woman from Midnight Diner. It's crazy how your service experience can impact a meal because it did. I'd prob go to Midnight Diner before I'll go to Redeye Diner again IMO.",

The food came out in good time and was hot. They serve strong coffee which is what I like. Located in EpiCenter and super easy to find. They are open like 24hrs and serve all kinds of food, there is even a bar area. The tables and dining room were clean.   My only criticism is that a pest control worker can straight through the front door which his pray can and all. I did not appreciate it whatsoever. There has to be a back foot for these types of things and if not, make one.",

I will say that they crowd was very different from breakfast to late night and the customer service in the morning was a lot better. But, there were sooooo many people trying to get in there for a late night meal compared to breakfast. For breakfast....Please please try the shrimp and grits and also the chicken wings. Nothing more to say....shrimp and grits and wings. Their breakfast was amazing and the servers are super nice.    I was visit for business and staying at the Omni. I was a bit hesitant due to the yelp rating. But when we asked around, this was the recommendation given by multiple people. Definitely worth it.",

There's not a lot of options for food late night in uptown, so if you're hungry after a Hornets game, concert, etc this is a great option. They are open 24/7, 365 days a year at the EpiCentre.  It's a huge diner menu and good food at a great price. For this adventure, my boyfriend got The Uptown (waffle, hash browns or grits, and two eggs any style for $9.99). Important note: the hashbrowns here are shredded. Personally, I think those are the best kind. You can also get them smothered, scattered, chunked, or all the way. I got the Cool Ranch Wrap ($8.99 and comes with waffle fries). It all his the spot.   Other menu notes: you can get breakfast anytime. Their signature items are the shrimp & grits, chicken & waffles, and steak burgers.  If you don't have time to sit down and eat, you can also order for pickup by phone or on their website.",

I don't know what it was that made me think it wouldn't be good but I was wrong. We started with drinks - mimosa for me (they were out of Blue Moon) and an Angry Orchard for my guy. For lunch, I went with breakfast food (half order of coconut crunchy french toast and hashed browns with mushrooms and onions) and my fella went with lunch (1/4 fried chicken, mac and cheese and mashed potatoes and gravy). Mine was awesome in pretty much every way. I doused the hashed browns with Texas Pete (naturally) and they were perfect! I was a little nervous about the french toast because I don't love coconut but it was delicious! My guy loved his macaroni and cheese, liked his fried chicken (just wished it was better seasoned) and thought the mashed potatoes were just okay (\"they kinda taste like mashed potatoes from a fast food place\"). He said he would definitely come back again and would try something else (but get the mac and cheese, for sure).  The service was great and fast. Our waitress was super helpful because I had countless questions about items on the menu (shout out to Mercedes!). A win all the way around!",

Eggs are moist, bacon cooked to perfection, good coffee, and good marble rye toast. Courteous staff. Located in the center of uptown. Walking distance to all hotels.   Went later for dinner and tried their Nathan's hot dog. Cooked perfectly. Have all the condiments you can choose. Saw the deserts they offer. Variety and all look very good.  Will return when I am in Charlotte.",

The feeling of the restaurant is that of a 50's diner with 50's R&B & Rock playing. FYI: waitress didn't know the difference between large wings and whole wings (large wings does not mean whole wings, they are actually whole wings cut up making them large) and the hot flavor is just hot sauce.  Their chicken is ok, but is to bland for my taste.  The just assume the customer knows the menu not taking into account that visitor's come into their place.  When I return to Charlotte I will not go to this restaurant.",

Our waiter was fabulous and extremely attentive. The manager checked on us twice. I did not see one dissatisfied expression in the house this place is wonderful for breakfast lunch and dinner.

The waitress at the counter then informed me after I waited for 10 minutes to be served that I would have to wait 30 minutes to also place a take out order. As I mentioned there were only 3 tables seated in the restaurant and all 3 tables had completed their meals . There were also several other parties still waiting to be seated and all being told the same thing. Two staff members were walking around talking on their cell phones and the others were just chatting to each other . It appeared that no one was working . I then walked around to the pub around the corner which was packed with less staff working . I was seated immediately and served my meal in a timely manner .  I would never recommend this diner and would encourage the management to step up there game and employ staff with a work ethic",

She came back at least 2x asking if I had decided. Finally, I chose BLT and \"Homemade Onion Rings\" with secret sauce.  From my point of view, these were the thinnest slices of onion with hardly any breading, instead of being wonderful slice of heaven, they were hard, chewy. Took only 1 bite of one. Put it back, The portion sandwich was ok, thankfully it wasn't on large bread. It was served in two halves, lots of lettuce, nice slice tomatoes and thick bacon.",

There are a ton of options and although I've only tried a few dishes so far, I have liked each one.  For Uptown, the prices are very reasonable especially considering the amount of food you get.",

I would recommend NOT TO COME Here AT NIGHT. They don't even deserve 1 star . ZERO STARS if you ask me ... Red eye sucks . Better off going home to make your own breakfast .",

Our server came over promptly and brought waters but after that she got really, really slack with her job. Her name tag says she was the shift manager and I'm not entirely sure how she actually got that position, because she certainly is not a pillar of management I would look up to. The food was less than stellar and, at best, just edible. I got the spaghetti with meat sauce and you could tell it was definitely straight out of the jar or can. Got to pick on pie for dessert and it was OK, but again, less than stellar. Basically, if you want great service and a really great tasting meal, don't go to this place. It's terrible and I will not be back. There are many more better options in the Epicentre.",

Everything I've had here has been outstanding. They hand bread their chicken tenders and you can tell. I don't use sauce when I eat chicken tenders so I normally have to add salt and pepper but it's not needed. It was tender and juicy with plenty of flavor. The firecracker chicken sandwich taste like orange or sesame (minus the sesame seeds) chicken but on a bun. Even the spaghetti was awesome. It's meaty and not tomato tasting. Definitely homemade.",

There was a sign that said wait to be seated so we stood there about 10-15 min without anyone acknowledging our presence. Finally got fed up and left. Went to the bar at the hotel and had more luck ordering from a limited menu.  We're here for another night but we're definitely not going back.",

Breakfast is the easiest thing to make. Asked for naked toast, got butter saturated bread. Waited 20 minutes, still no naked toast.  Let's see, put bread on hot griddle or toaster, one minute latter naked toast.   Owner and manager, someone in the kitchen is not understanding English or knows how to make simple breakfast. There are a lot of people counting on the place to stay open for their livelihoods.  Didn't give one star because the waitress tied and was very nice. Will give another chance one day, hope things get better.",

He brought me my favorite dish but unfortunately it was served under temp. I simply told him what was wrong and he shortly came back with a delicious hot bowl of shrimp and grits.

If you really want a treat try one of their awesome cakes or milkshakes",

Great Location: The Epicentre in Charlotte, NC is walking distance from the Transportation Center so it can be reached without a car.  Great Staff: From management to support staff I cannot bestow high enough accolades!  The manager on duty Saturday was a joy to behold! Bravo Ms. Shakia Chambers! Bravo!  I watched her while she directed her staff and was not afraid to be seen pushing a cart full of dirty dishes. I observed Ms. Chambers perform each task with a calm, cool, and collected dignity. She had it together so her staff kept it together!  Ms. Mecca was in the process of seating 20+ hungry diners when my mother and I arrived late Saterday afternoon.   We were seated right by the door and I was able to observe the would be chaos become calm and organized!  It was a hot Saturday afternoon and I enjoyed watching this well run establishment create order out of the seeming chaos!  I watched as Ms. Mecca remained calm and cool although a man repeatedly came up to her with an aggressive tone of voice. I could clearly see and hear that he was upset yet I NEVER heard or witnessed Ms. Mecca retort in any fashion other with the height of professionalism!  After watching in amazement for awhile I decided that my dining experience needed to be documented!  Ms. Khadija was our waitress and was AWESOME! She was very attentive. She apologized for our wait. We understood that it was a direct result of our being among the 20+ diners who had all decided to come eat at the same time.  Even if the kitchen was short staffed it was well worth the wait!  Food/Affordable: I saved the BEST for last. The  under $20.00 large bowl of Shrimp & Grits with biscuit was not only filling but delicious! The creamy grits were topped with a perfectly seasoned spicy shrimp and gravy.  There are many things in life today that can go wrong. There are many stressors and reasons for complaint. Whenever you can 'break bread' with your family at a restaurant that can make you feel at home, safe, satisfied and leave happy, suddenly you are strengthened to fight another day!  The world would be a better place if more who worked with the public knew how; or at least attempted to develop such a great mindset that life would be so much better when can agree that \"we are all in this together!\"  Thank you #RedEyeDiner for giving me this wonderful experience!",

It was a little after midnight so there was a small wait of about 5-10 minutes. Once we got in, we were seated rather quickly. We sat down and was immediately greeted by our server Ateli. She gave us PHENOMENAL service. She was willing to answer the heaping amount of questions we had and was extremely prompt in getting our drinks and orders in once we finally made a decision. The food was hot and delicious. The drink specials weren't super great considering it was a Friday night. Couldn't really tell there was any alcohol in it. For it to be my first time visiting, I would definitely come back AND ask for Ateli.",

Understandably this is a busy time, I asked the doorman if I could sit with my friends and he stated parties are only sat when everyone is there. Understandable. My party had already been sat for 4 of 7 people... I pointed to their table (from standing in line) the door man shrugged then stated \"you're not getting in tonight\" confused I asked why? \"He stated tables are only sat when the entire party are present\" which is understandable but my party was seated clearly. I asked if I could join my party at their table which was greeted with \"you're not getting in tonight\" my entire party ended up leaving because we could not meet. I understand the policy of seating a party once all are present but denying a patron after seating his party when it was clearly expressed more people would join isn't the patrons fault. Allowing someone to join their seated party can't possibly be such a hassle?",

My waitress was fun and personable and interacted with my children, which is a plus considering how nerve wracking taking small kids out can be. The food I ordered was great. I had the firecracker shrimp, which I liked a lot. I also ordered a hotdog on a whim, which was good, too. My wife was very happy, which is the only part of this that matters. We'll be back. And maybe when I'm partying in Uptown, I'll drag my friends over for a bite to eat.",

    "text": "I was enchanted with this restaurant! It was in a group of restaurants that when I went at \"late night \" the second time was well guarded by a well noticed security guard for the whole area which seemed was not really needed. I had a wonderful \"diner \" style breakfast, and a great bowl of chicken noodle soup for late night when I was late night hungry. I was alone on business and felt wonderfully safe using Uber on the street to go back. The diner was decorated with platinum records of oldie goldie stars and fantastic food! Please consider this place because the menu has standards and contemporary cuisine and culture to enjoy!",

He ordered his food (something simple) when an hour had passed and he still didn't recieve his food.. he left the waitress a Tip and attempted to leave. Security got into an argument with him because he didn't have a receipt.. This place is horrible. If you must eat here order to go..it will take about 2 hours for them to make your food.",

I was hoping for food as good as that at the original pancake house. My meal was simple just their tall stack of pancakes with a side of sausage and orange juice. Sadly the pancakes were flat, thin and dense, while the orange juice was watered down.  I won't give up hope and may try again.  But this was my first impression.",

No salad was given to me until after my food was delivered and I had to ask for it. My burger had sauce on it. When I asked for a new burger the shift manager said they usually don't give the option to order a burger with out sauce???? What??? Does the mean burger buns come premade with an infused special sauce on the bun??? And why not tell me this as I am ordering??? We ended up taking the top bun off my wife's burger and swapping it for the side with sauce of mine...didn't want to deal with the wait of new food and the fact the manager made me feel like it was my fault.. management is horrible.. food was sub par.... will never eat here again.",
