    "text": "The Wine Shop is definitely worth a try. In addition to wonderful wines by the glass as well as a good selection of beer, their food is really very good. Our table had hanger steak, ravioli, greens, spinach and the truffle fries. Everything was well prepared and  good. My group was pleased. The wait staff of two was doing the best they could with a full house on a Saturday night. My one complaint is the kitchen's reluctance to make any alterations to their dishes (they would not substitute spinach for greens??)   This is in a great location - go shopping at Southpark and then drive down Fairview a couple of miles and have a nice dinner. I plan to return for a glass of wine and appetizer at the bar or for a full meal sometime soon.",

    "text": "I agree completely about the wonderful wine selection and you can buy a lovely glass from behind the bar to try before you buy.  But not nearly enough has been said about the food!  I stopped by the first time to check it out with my mom who is from out of town but loves wine. We met the owner that day and learned about the store and restaurant.   Since then, my husband and I have dined there twice. Each time the food was simply superb. These people really care about their food!    We ate at the bar the first night and were in the perfect position to see the various dishes come out of the kitchen  lots of lovely  fresh salads with mancheo cheese and some nuts in a slightly spicy glaze on top. We ordered one the second visit and cant wait to have it again. The dressing was so tasty too. I highly recommend the crispy chicken. It's served with a mushroom gravy over faro. I would order this every day if I could! The faro was something new for me and a cross between barley & rice. We decided it was a rather healthy comfort food full of flavor.   We also ordered a side of fries and they had some delicious herbs on them, were hot, and tasty!  They do not seem to be in a hurry so it is a relaxed environment. You may need to flag them down to let them know you are ready to order or request your check, but they were great at keeping our water/wine glasses filled.   I understand that the wines by the glass change frequently, so guess there will new things to try each time we return.   Don't miss the doughnut dessert.",

    "text": "This is my favorite wine shop in Charlotte hands down! They have the best wine selection, a great variety of quality beers, and some sake.  The guys that run this shop have great palates because they select only high quality wines from great regions all over the wine world and best vintages as well.  Plus they will special order wines that you don't see on their shelves.   This little store/eatery has a great atmosphere, cozy, welcoming, not \"metro\", but has a more local feel. The Wine Shop is half retail and half mini-restaurant.  There's hundreds of wines set up on shelves along the wall to wall to wall to wall to wall, and in between you'll find wooden wine racks loaded with even more wine.  The whole space is divided into 2 areas, the front where you will find all of your white wines, and the back room containing all the reds.  They offer wines priced anywhere from the low  $10s to $$$$ (these wines are located in the back room in a special area with red velvet shelving), but keep in mind, any single bottle you buy from here (whether pricey or not), has been tasted either by the owner or staff and is guaranteed of great quality; best representing the region of the wine, the vintage, and how the wine was made.    This wine shop offers a full menu of small plates and many many wines by the glass (the best wine list you'll find in Charlotte!) So when having wine, have cheese, which this wine shop has plenty to offer.  Cheese comes with nuts, honey, fruit, bread and olive oil and you can make your own cheese plate or just have 1.  Each portion of cheese is definitely large enough to share.  The wine shop offers weekly wine tasting events, special wine dinners, and special (tutored)  wine tasting events, often times hosting the actual wine maker or producer.  The weekly tastings are free, but the wine dinners and special wine tasting events can range from $20-$around$70 per person.   Overall, the service is great and the wine selection is awesome!! The service is great, the staff knows their wine, but also very importantly, knows their customers and will pretty accurately match a great wine for customers individually.",

Found the staff very informative and the selections all labeled for easy walking around.   Great place to visit before dinner at Barringtons next door or a movie at Phillips Place. I'll be back soon!",

    "text": "Being a huge fan of The Wine Shop At Rivergate, I decided to try the The Wine Shop at Foxcroft. We started out with a great bottle of Rose, chilled perfectly. The only thing I disagree with is the fact they want to charge you a 10.00  corking  fee even you are eating in the restaurant. I think that should be waved if you dine in. We ordered a few of the appetizers. We asked for the Chartecurie  Board of Cheese and Meat for two, The Spinach Salad with Sweet Potato, pepitas and Cumin Dressing, and Truffle fries. The Spinach Salad was delicious, the sweet potatoes were warm and the dressing spot on! The Truffle Fries were perfect, crisp and light with the delicious truffle oil on them. The Meat and Cheese tray was lacking - the two pieces of cheese were so tiny Not enough for one , let alone two people. The meat choices were good - topped with a couple of random nuts and raisins. I would not recommend this but the other choices were wonderful . The waitress was very attentive and water was refilled a couple of times. Then for dessert we ordered the Donuts...Oh yes --the donuts were so good! Three Powdered Sugar ones and three Cinnamon Sugared ones. With tasty dipping sauces, one mocha and one caramel one. I could have done \"shots\" of the caramel sauce-tasted like the top of Creme Brulee! Heavenly!. Returning here will be a Yes for me..and the Donuts ..A double Yes!",

    "text": "No more Falcor Syrah after 2005!  Now onto the important tidbits. The staff knows their wine or I should say the staff waiting on us knows their wine. For instance we selected a bottle of Falcor 2005 Syrah neither of us were familiar with this varietal of Falcor but knew they made an awesome Cabernet Franc. We asked the server his opinion and he gave us the thumbs up and told us it was a good selection. Now onto the details of what made this wine so special. He told us the 2005 Syrah was the last year Falcor planted Syrah grapes. He gave us the skinny on why Falcor chose to to stop making the Syrah varietal. Sadly enough syrah grapes are too expensive to grow in that region so they planted Cabernet grapes instead. Knowing this secret I may have to buy up the rest of the 2005 Falcor Syrah because it was pretty tasty.  No I am not a wino I just appreciate a nice smooth glass of wine on a weekly basis. Must keep the heart healthy! They charge a $5.00 corking fee for bottles of wine under $30.00 but to my surprise the fee was waived on a bottle I purchased that was less than thirty dollars one of the other times I came into the shop. I have not purchased just a glass there but I know they have a large selection of both wine and beers by the glass. Beer drinkers do not fret there are plenty of options Lagers, Porters, and English Ales Oh My! They even have my favorite pear cider.  Next up is food. They have nightly specials and a decent selection of appetizers, salads and pasta. I asked the server where they purchased their pasta from well guess what folks it is homemade! Enough said for me. I was expecting to hear Pasta Provisions but I was wrong. They served a fish special the night we were there and discovered they get their fish from the NC Coast. Apparently they have a fisherman who supplies fish for them and several other restaurants in the Charlotte Area. My friend and I shared a cheese plate and and the Roasted Apple Salad. Both selections were tasty. I am always a fan of interesting salad concoctions. I am more and more impressed with this place each and every time I come and learn a little bit more about this place. An establishment attempting to support the local movement speaks a lot about what kind of business they run. Meaning it is not always about the bottom line. That's it for now folks!",

    "text": "A small but ample wine shop that kicks it up a notch with some very fine food pairings and a fine selection of wines and beers by the glass.  When it's wine time, these guys are most deserving of a visit.  So like most boutique-size wines stores, this shop has a couple rooms where the walls and a couple middle aisles are lined with wine divided by region and (sometimes) by varietal.  The shop keepers have been in business for quite a while and know their stuff.  They, however, are low key and welcome customers just browsing thru the collections.  Need a special bottle or looking for a particular varietal?  Just ask- warm and friendly knowledge is amply available.  But what sets the shop apart, in my opinion, is the small but gourmet menu of food offerings made and served in house.  In addition to a bar, there are 5-6 small tables available to seat small parties.  The menu includes expected cheese and crostini plates, but don't miss the smoked almonds or the house-made donuts.  The focus is on small plates, and there are sliders, small salads, and sometimes a few house-made pastas available.  Don't think full meal- rather, imagine opening a fine bottle of wine and finding a few small bites to pair with it to enhance the experience.  The chef took his time with the menu here- picking a few but very well-thought out selections that are savory and pair well with popular wine varietals.  I've had most of the menu and can vouch that there is not a poor selection to be made.  Servers are also well versed in the menu and available to help with pairings on request.  You can choose a beer or wine from their \"by the glass\" selections which rotate from time to time.  Whites are served cold and reds just below room temp- as they should be.  But you can also browse through the store a bring a bottle of choice right back to your table for opening and imbibing.  Talk about immediate gratification!    This store is great for an after-work or after-shopping stop off to relax and refresh.  Great service, great selection, and you need not leave hungry.  This Wine Shop delivers on all fronts.",

This store is no where near the size of Total Wine, but, in term of what limited selection they carry, they have a SUPERB selection! There are some super premium wines, like many Burgundy Grand Crus! I don't know anybody else in Charlotte that has the depth and selection of Burgundys like this shop does. OK so you got me.....I'm a PINOTFILE! LOL...What can I say.  It's not all high end by any means. They have a wonderful selection of affordable but great quality wines. The rest of their staff is very knowledgeable as well, but not nearly as much as Conrad and Eric. And their wine bar is really a lot of fun as well. It's small so don't expect to hop in on a Fri or Sat evening and simply sit down. They have a simple bar menu but it's all pretty tasty.

I don't get to come to this part of South Charlotte very often, but when I do, I'm always enjoying the kitschy shops and restaurants. It is indeed the perfect location for the Wine Shop. Not only does the shop carry a bazillion bottles of really intriguing wines and sparkling vinos (organized by country/region), but it also has a lovely setup with a small menu. You can comfortably park it in the middle of this wine wonderland and enjoy wines by the glass and by the bottle, meat and cheese plates, varying crostinis, etc. It's small bites, guys, so don't expect to gorge.   I fully savored an amazing glass of Black Slate, a medium bodied red with a super smooth finish. That's probably one of the coolest parts of the Wine Shop - the staff is super knowledgeable about the products they carry and how to consume them to their fullest.

    "text": "Wow....now I along with my GF visited the Wine Shop for the first time last night and I cannot believe anyone hasn't reviewed this place yet?!?!    Now a disclaimer....Tonya works here, so she COULD have Yelped this first, but wanted one of us to come in and do it...so I did and was very surprised.   In addition to just having a fantastic wine selection, they also serve food which we also had a few items off the menu which ranges from creative cheese plates to full meals, all of which are reasonably priced.  With plenty of seating and a nice little bar, one can savor many different wines.  For this visit we went both red and white, but in the end chose a nice light white wine for drinking at home at a later date.  The wine selection is wild!  2 big rooms of a huge selection, so if you are looking for good wine and want a great selection, then check out the Wine Shop.  Tonya was a perfect host and we really had a great time.  She works Mondays and Tuesdays, so if you get a hankering for some vino, stop by and tell her Michael E sent  ya *wink*.",

Great after work spot for those on this side of the town but also appears to be a popular place to just come in and grab light bites and great wine.  Beer, don't forget the beer.  There are a few taps that probably rotate I assume but they also have a solid bottle reserve available.    The food was really good and the cheese plate was LARGE to say the least.",

The place is really busy so grab tables while you can and enjoy the people watching over a glass or bottle of wine and some small nibbles in their cozy space.  I loved the cheese and charcuterie plates, yum! I also had a bit of Mr. W's flatbread and it tasted deliciously crunchy and cheesy but surprisingly also fairly light. The beer selection is not super great but there's tons and tons of wine and rightly so or they'd be failing at naming wouldn't they?  Thanks to all the people who came out to throw me a going away bash, I'm going to come back and bother Tonya P. again next time I'm in Charlotte for sure!",

So much so that I tried 4x before finally giving up. The first time we were there everything was great. They suggested a great wine for us, food was tasty, all good. Unfortunately, it went downhill from there. On our second and third visits, service was lacking. There were long gaps of time when our server was MIA, and it took forever to get our check. The last time we stopped in just to buy a bottle. The store was completely empty except for a distributor. I really wanted some suggestions, but they never acknowledged me (not even a hello). I don't know if they treat regulars better, but I felt like everytime we asked for something we were putting them out. So I will continue my search for a wine shop in town.",

We really enjoyed the beef sliders, which I remember saying, these are the real deal. Our \"friend\" even recommended we get 4 instead of 3 so we wouldn't have to share the 3rd one.

Foxcroft has a small but good selection of beers on tap, with a heavy emphasis on Carolina and Charlotte craft beer. There's a nice variety too. I've had everything from browns and stouts to IPAs and goses. Not a bad beer. There's also a really small bottle and can selection of beer, but this is far from a bottle shop. Since it's a wine shop, simply having some beer is a nice touch.  I usually come here with colleagues before the kitchen opens, so I haven't tried much of their food. I always get the nuts as a snack, and they are delicious. A little bit spicy, a little bit sweet. The cheese platters are also very good, and they'll gladly vary the cheese selection to fit your tastes.  The service is always great. The employees know their stuff, are very attentive, and are always friendly. I'll definitely keep coming back. I'm looking forward to trying their other food offerings one of these days.",

One of my favorite red blends was about $7 cheaper here than at Dean and Deluca.  Reds are in the back behind a wall at the back of the bar, whites and roses are on the back wall behind the tables.  A little awkward to weave through diners to get to the whites, but it's not a huge deal as the place is casual.   The restaurant - Excellent food all around.  The chef's bruchetta is hit or miss, but I think that is more down to personal preference over the actual preparation.  The flat breads are always a hit, you cant go long with truffle fries and the olives are a great starter - tossed in some kind of pesto-ish (?) dressing.  They portion of olives and nuts is very large.  The atmosphere is casual, the kind of place that you imagne everyone is a regualr, but if you arent you don't feel out of place.  The waitstaff is very knoweldgeable and not afraid to make a recomnendation on wine or food.  My one complaint is the TV's - I feel that they take away from the cozy wine bar feel.  There was a game on one night that I was there recently and I felt like it detracted from the atmosphere.  Maybe play music and run old movies on mute?   All in all one of my favorite go to local places in the South Park area.",

We were just going to order a glass, but then decided the bottle was a more economical route.  Something to consider if you are having wine with others.  For example, a single glass of prosecco was $9, however a bottle cost $17 and for any bottle under $30, there is a $10 cork fee.  So, for $27 we had 6 glasses between us which is way better than $9/ea or $54.  We ordered the smoked nuts...OH MY!...so good!...and the portion was huge.    We've seen the donuts and have heard to try the truffle fries.  We will be back to try those things and more.  We may just become \"regulars\".    This is a wine shop with quite the selection of wines and bottled beers, if you need to grab and go.  However, I recommend sitting down and enjoying a beverage by the glass or have them cork a bottle.  They also had a decent selection of beers on tap, maybe 6 or 8 options.  The menu looked fantastic but we were their solely for the drinks.  I loved the look and feel of the place.  It always seems to have a crowd.  Cheers!",

Things are different now-menu is smaller, seafood entrees are priced higher and the grilled pound cake dessert can't compare to the donuts.  Sliders were still good, speckled trout entree was pricey at $26 for a not too big portion. The shop was still very crowded and the servers are as friendly and efficient as ever, when they are not running around.  We liked the \"old\" Foxcroft better.  P.S.- website menu is out of date.",

    "text": "I'll admit it - I'm dumb.  I'd heard about The Wine Shop, but I always thought it was just a store where you bought wine.  No judging!    We were having dinner at Barrington's around the corner, and for some reason, I decided to look at The Wine Shop's website to see if it was a place we could have a drink before dinner.  Could we ever!  Not only did they have some great wines, but they also had some fairly unique beers AND food.  Clearly, I've been living under a rock.  I was amazed at how large the place was when we got there, and I immediately loved the atmosphere.  With all the wood and somewhat dim lighting, it felt like a classy, yet rustic, cabin/lodge.  (That's supposed to be a compliment.  Adjectives aren't my forte.)  The bar was large enough to seat 15ish people, and there were a ton of tables, not to mention walls and walls of wine bottles for purchase.  We didn't get any food, but it looked very inventive.  I was so intrigued by the Brussels sprouts and apples that now I'm kicking myself for not trying it.  Some wine shops I've been to have felt clique-y or loud.  If there were regulars there, the servers acknowledged them, but we felt just as welcome as newbies.  I appreciated the classy, quiet yet vibrant feel, and I really appreciated the free wi-fi.  We'll definitely be back and probably for drinks AND dinner!",

After visiting the Dilworth location for years, when I moved to Southpark I was happy to see this spot was just a few blocks away.  Foxcroft is very inviting, it is a great place to drop in for a glass of wine or two on a date night or even with a group of friends.  They have an extensive wine selection and an amazing food menu as well.  I would suggest stopping in for a glass or even bottle, enjoy a small plate or two and end the night off with the homemade donuts, they are too die for.  On a side note, join their mailing lists to hear about their wine events!",

The atmosphere is really cozy inside and can even feel a little cramped when it was as busy as it was when we were there, but hey, wine bars can be intimate sometimes.    Our server was not particularly helpful with recommendations but was nice and attentive.  We opted for a glass of white, a pale ale on tap and an order of the house-made doughnuts.    If I had to sum up the donuts in one word: I couldn't.  They're absolutely amazing.  Think of those really delicious state fair doughnuts with the cinnamon, but even better.  Freshly fried, very hot, dusted with cinnamon and served with chocolate and caramel sauce.   They also come in an insane portion (I know they cost $8, but we weren't expecting 8 doughnuts.  That was a shock).   Definitely a worthwhile stop for a cozy dessert and drink, and the entrees look pretty great too!  Will definitely be returning to try the dinner.",

I frequently visit Foxcroft after work and on Fridays. My husband and I decided to hit up our neighborhood location for pre dinner wine and apps. $80 into our evening we wrapped up a lovely night on the patio, a paid tab, and semi full tummies we were headed home to eat dinner and watch movies.   The waitress dropped a few plates on the concrete and somehow, the corner of one hit my foot and it started to bleed. Not wanting to cause a scene I quietly asked for paper napkins or a towel so I didn't leave my DNA on the table linens. The staff was very apologetic and helpful. I was impressed. One of them asked for my name and context t information and promised me I would get a phone call from the manager.   I waited two weeks. No phone call.  I would have given this location 5 stars even with this incident, but I didn't get a call. I expected nothing more than solid customer service and a follow up call.   Please do go and enjoy Foxcroft. Their wine selections and food are decadent. I just want people to understand how far small gestures go!",

    "text": "We came for the $5 pop-up wine tasting event on Saturday afternoon.  So did everyone else!  The location was packed to the gills by the time we left.    The venue was cute, just like what I'd want my kitchen to look like if I had unlimited space.  Red wines everywhere, recycled wood floor to ceiling, wall to wall, great lighting, and fabulous containers for dry goods.  There was a closed off room which seemed to be getting a lot of natural light and had normal height tables you could sit at; I wish we had been allowed in there.  There was also a super cute patio area which is probably amazing on a warm spring or cool summer night.  Not so much 20-degree winter weather, though.  The tasting wines were good, six different cabs from Napa Valley, with a pretty serious variety in flavor, astringency, and linger.  The pours were small, which isn't that surprising for $5, but they were inconsistent.  That bothered me a bit, as it meant different members of the group finished each round at a different time.  Not that normal drinking wouldn't vary, but adding to the mix some pours twice as large as others just doesn't feel great.    The one guy who was in charge of the tasting was just swamped, though, and there was always a long line to get the next round of tasting (you sat or stood where ever there was space, then returned to him when you were ready).  He sometimes told us what the wine was, sometimes told us more about what the wine was like, or about the vineyard, or sometimes nothing at all.  No one was trying to push he wines and I'm not sure it would have been easy to purchase a bottle or case if we had wanted to, as all three staff members seemed frenetic.  I want to come back and try this place out again, but I hope they figure their tastings out a little better.",

While we were eating the cheese and charcuterie board, which was fine, my date pointed out that there were roaches at my feet and one was crawling up my shoe.  After requesting and viewing the bill, I went in and ask to speak to the manager.  I advised of the problem I told the waitress and that since, I had roaches at my feet and crawling up my leg.  I asked the manager why the courtyard was open if they knew there were roaches everywhere.  The manager replied that there were a lot fewer roaches inside and most customers understand there will be bugs outside.   I asked if she was going to do anything about the bill.   Coming from New York, any restaurant would have been mortified, especially after notifying the waitress, but the manager was pretty much laissez-faire about the whole things.....No big deal to her.  Next call is to the board of health!!!  Disgusting!!!!!!!",

We went for a glass of wine at the bar and ended up staying for a few.  For a Monday night, I was expecting this place to be completely dead...only to find the opposite.  A bustling spot where just about every seat was taken.  I sat at the bar.  A perfect seat to talk over wine while watching a little Monday Night Football.  In no way was the TV the center of attention (this is not a sports bar people).  Just perfect for checking the scores and getting back to conversation.  The bartender was constantly on the move, but managed to periodically check in on us to make sure we were OK.  I will certainly be back to try the food!  If you have a group of people or are looking for a good, lively date spot in the South Park area that isn't stuffy, Foxcroft is the place to go!  FYI, they have a few beers in case someone in your group doesn't drink wine (which I don't understand, but oookkkkkkk, no judgement).",

Went on a Friday night and there is plenty of parking, but the lot fills rather quickly it appears more popular stores are moving in the area. It's in a mini shopping where Foxcroft is smack in the front. Upon entering I was greeted and seated. There were tons of people standing as they sipped their wine or beer. I assumed this place was a place for wine tasting, classes, and good food. It's more of a restaurant only with just wine and limited beer selection. They have a simple selection of wine offered. I am not sure of how they pick their wines and if it's changed out. Nothing was explained. It's pretty small on the inside with limited space at the bar. It's not a casual calm cool place to come, but a who's who place. The main courses are small like appetizer style plates or tapas. I liked the lamb burger and especially loved the donuts. The lamb burgers had a cucumber on them. This changed the taste. The donuts are a hit! They were piping hot and fresh. I wasn't a fan of the dipping sauces that came with the donuts. The chocolate sauce was like a bitter sweet or semi sweet that didn't quite pair well with either donut (powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar). The caramel sauce tasted better, but it sweet. We had wine of course, but prior to ordering the wine tasted a few none of them were amazing. The beef sliders were over cooked and they knew it so they threw a ton of oil on them to try and moisten them up. The fries were okay. Hope this helps!",
