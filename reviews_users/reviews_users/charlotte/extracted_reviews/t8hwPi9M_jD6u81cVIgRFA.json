First time I asked if they have a family pack, she said yes and said it comes with 2 sides and she named all the sides. I asked for onion rings and baked beans. Her reply was \"Honey we can't measure a pint of onion rings\". THEN WHY DID YOU NAME ALL THE SIDES WHEN I CAN ONLY HAVE BAKED BEANS AND COLESLAW???? Second time she called me honey again grrrrrr... This time I ordered chicken tenders special. I asked if they could do half plain and half spicy dipped(btw spicy dipped not that great) she immediately asked me something else about the order. So I asked again thinking she was distracted and didn't hear my request. To which her reply was \"honey you just asked that\". WELL OK WHY DIDN'T YOU RESPOND WITH A YES OR NO???? She's extremely rude. Don't businesses know how important customer service is?? I will not order again from lancasters. Also when I picked up my order she immediately answered the phone when I was signing the receipt- I couldn't even ask for an extra ranch. Never going back.",

My boyfriend had been many times before. We arrived and were immediately seated. While looking over the menu, I noticed a good amount of the options had mushrooms in them. Me, being highly allergic, I had to choose something that didn't have mushrooms listed to be safe. It also narrowed down my choices quite a bit. I settled for the burger with the fried egg and a side of mac and cheese. The mac and cheese tasted like over cooked noodles and watered down cheese wiz. The burger had no taste and again, these cheese was a weird consistency. The waitress refilled our drinks, but never asked us how our food was. I only took maybe two bites of the burger and by the time she came around the burger was completely dissected. The bacon wasn't cooked and the egg seemed like it had been siting under a heat lamp. When the yolk came out, it was already filmed over. We had our plates filled with trash, the server offered us refills once more yet, didn't pre bus. Or upsell desserts or ask if we were ready for our check, just disappeared",

The service is on the slow side yet 100 percent worth your wait. I usually order the pp platter or brisket with Jamaican honey wings with a side of mac and cheese. Coming from a mac and cheese fanatic id say their's is some of the best.  Recently they seemed to have done some work to the interior which in my opinion was a downgrade. They took out all the racing stuff and cool signs they had up to exchange for a much more modern setting. Oh well. The place rocks.",

    "text": "Being in Charlotte for work I happened by this place when I was headed back to the hotel after spending some time at the Latta Plantation.  I had not had barbeque in a while so I thought I would give this place a shot.  I know bbq is different in various parts of the country so I went in here with an open mind.  I got my food to go so I am allowing some leeway for that.  I had brisket and pork ribs with sides of potato salad and Brunswick stew with funnel fries for desert.    I will start with the good which was the potato salad.  It was really good and had a good dill flavor to it which I like.  The Brunswick stew was ok, good and hearty but could have used a little more salt.  Now the rest, I may be jaded being from Austin which has so many good bbq joints and the cooking style is different.   A barbeque dinner is not complete without brisket so I had to have some.  What I saw when I opened my package is something I have never witnessed with sliced brisket before.  The slices had grill marks on them!  I couldn't help to keep from chuckling when I saw that.  They were obviously fresh off the grill.  The sauce on them was good and had a good flavor.   The pork ribs in my opinion had been boiled and then smoked.  The way the meat fell off the bones was not typical to smoked ribs.  They had the same good sauce on them.  The funnel fries would have been good if there was more than a dash of powdered sugar on them, for what I paid for the meal, they could have been more liberal in applying sugar on the desert.    To sum up this may be a good barbeque joint in North Carolina but it would never survive against the competition back home in Austin.",

    "text": "I've been going to Lancaster's for a while now and although I've had the off meal or two, all in all, I am a fan of this place.  Due to the fact that I work fairly close to Lancaster's, I try to get takeout as much as I can.  My go-to-meal is the BAR-BA-LO wings which are legendary around these parts.  Their ranch, when you can get it cold, it above par as well.  We've all heard of the magical Bar-ba-lo wings that many places claim to have originated.  Well, I don't know if Lancaster's Bar-Ba-Lo's were the first, but they sure are the best!  The wings are always meaty and dripping with loads of sauce.  Of course you always have the option to ask for them extra crispy.  Me personally, I love them how they come.    *Kid's cheeseburger is legit - very cost effective, yet filling.  It comes with fries.   *Cobb and Maui Salads are excellent.  I usually add a hard-boiled egg onto each. *BBQ sandwich is good, comes with a side of BBQ sauce (vinegar) and slaw.   *I have never had the brisket personally, but I've been told by coworkers that its phenomenal.   To me, its better to take your food and go if you have that option available. Sometimes the waitress service can be spotty and it can take a while to get your meal during lunch time.  The to-go area is always quick and the service is always great.    Lancaster's is not a world beater when it comes to BBQ, especially in such a hot-bed of 'QUE.  With that being said, its definitely worth a try and is probably the best BBQ option in the immediate area.",

For example, we were in the area for a convention this past weekend, so we stopped here for lunch on Friday. One way to tell a good barbeque joint? The local cops are eating here. When we arrived, there were three separate groups of law enforcement eating here.  So, for lunch, hubby had a platter that had pulled pork and fried chicken. I had a lunch plate with just the pork. We also both had sweet tea and, of course, hushpuppies! Everything was tasty and cooked perfectly.  Our server was friendly and efficient. This was our third or fourth visit and we will be back!  Oh, they have updated their decor a bit since we were there last in November. Looks good!",

If you don't stray too far from the Eastern NC style pork, you will generally walk away relatively satisfied.  It's some of the other things on the menu where the adventure begins.  The fried catfish is usually very good.  The wings however are a real crap shoot.  No matter where I go, I ask for wings to be well done or extra crispy.  I don't care if the meat inside is on the dry side, I just don't want soft, non-crisp skin on them.  Lancaster's misses the mark more often than not. Including on my most recent visit this past Saturday.  On this visit I got a half and half wings/pork combo.  As usual, the pork was good with mostly lean, pretty well smoked meat but the wings a soggy mess.  Aside from the limp skin, they were way under-seasoned and bland.  Tasted mostly like grease even with the buffalo sauce they were shaken in.  The creamy coleslaw for a side was also in need of a good dose of salt and pepper.  The onion rings though... Out of this world good.  Light, very crispy batter.  Obviously cooked to order and served piping hot and delicious.  Some of the best O-rings I've had in Charlotte.  Lancaster's is what it is and as long as it continues in the A-OK 3 star or better range, I'll be back as it is a low key, casual atmosphere and I enjoy just a quick bite at the bar every once in a while.  Just remind me to go for the catfish and skip the wings!",

My husband had chicken finger which were what you would expect. I have the pulled pork which was good but I thing it had been reheated in a liquid. The Cole slaw was good. The BBQ sauce on the table was unlabeled so it was a bit of trial a miss. Service was efficient but not friendly. It was clean. Overall a decent place",

The mac-n-cheese tasted like the sauce came from a can. The Brunswick stew was OK, but nothing special. The \"Banana pudding\" was just commercial pudding with a few banana slices and dry vanilla wafers mixed in - nothing like traditional baked banana pudding.  This is our 2nd visit and likely our last.",

    "text": "If you have read any of my reviews for other BBQ restaurants then you know I don't put a lot of stock in BBQ reviews.  BBQ is a religion and very regional.  There are significant differences just in North Carolina alone.  You love what you grew up with and everybody else's BBQ is an abomination.  Now I have ate BBQ all over the South and have an appreciation for most of it.    My pulled pork plate was a little dry but I will cut them some slack.  It was late and we probably were getting pulled pork smoked from earlier that day.  The sides are decent.  They have an extensive menu for a  BBQ place.  This is not a pork only joint (pulled pork, ribs).  They have smoked brisket, chicken and fried catfish on the menu.  They also have two different sauces on the table (vinegar and catsup based).  You can also choose between BBQ and mayo slaw.  Decent beer selection if you need alcohol (and who doesn't).  It's all in bottles but hey that's not a problem.  My only rant, and it is with most BBQ place in NC, is I hate the dog turd hush puppies.  I need to send someone from Arkansas, Tennessee, Louisiana, or Mississippi to teach y'all how to make hush puppies.  1) Hush Puppies are round and 2) Y'all need to add some more spices, or maybe some chopped onions.   If you are devilish, some chopped jalapenos.  These dog turds appear to be nothing but 1/2 cornmeal, 1/2 flour and maybe some sugar.    Highly recommend Lancaster's.",

    "text": "I received a recommendation to visit this place from the trail guide while horseback riding at Latta Plantation Equestrian, so I decided to give it a try.  My friend and I arrived around 2:30ish pm, and there was not many patrons inside.  We were greeting by a friendly server (Lakanjelia), who directed us to our seats and took our drink orders.  Lakanjelia came back shortly after with some hushpuppies (which happened to be one of the few good items we ate during our visit), and took our orders.  My friend ordered the blackened fish and shrimp combo with baked beans and fried corn and I orderd the brisket and rib combo (rib was not for me) with \"seafood salad\" and mac&cheese.  After going through two baskets of the good hushpuppies, the food orders finally arrived.  I immediately gave my friend the rib, as I do not eat pork, we prayed, and begin to eat.  My friend then noticed that the fish and shrimp was not blackened as order, however, we decided not to bring that up to the waitress.  I then look at my \"seafood salad\" which was lacking any signs of seafood and the mac&cheese seemed to have come straight out of a box!  I mentioned this to the waitress, who kindly informed me that the \"seafood salad\", although called \"seafood salad\", does not actually have \"seafood\" in it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Are you freaking kidding me!!  Why name it that?  Is it in an attempt to bamboozle customers, Is it that the owner/creater of the menu does not know what a \"seafood salad\" is???????  The ever so friendly waitress asked if I wanted another side in the place of the \"seafood salad\" in which I immediately said yes, I will have the collard greens.  When the collard greens arrived they looked more like turnip/mustard greens (soggy, not well defined, nor fresh).  I took a bite of the collard greens and they also tasted burnt!!!  Next I bit into the brisket (which seemed to be overcooked) and it was very dry and the flavor resembled ham moreso than beef brisket.  I am no expert on brisket, however, I have eaten plenty of brisket from many different restarants/food establishments in the past and have never, I repeat, NEVER tasted any as worse as this one!!!  I mentioned this to the waitress and she went and informed who I presumed was hte manager.  He came over to the table with an arogance about him and stated \"I was told you did not like your food, what is/was wrong with it?\"  I kindly explained to him how I felt about the brisket and the collards.  He then walked off and came back shortly stating \"I am not comping your entire meal, which I never expected him to do so because the ribs (which was said to be good, per my friend) were ate.  When the bill came, it had a note on top stating \"Customer Didn't Like Brisket tasted Burnt it wasn't\" - MT.  I have never, in all my years dining out, received a comment such as that on any bill, as a result of me, the customer voicing my honest opinion on food I ordered, and would have had to pay for, given I did not like it!!!  The nerves of this guy!!!    I am sure anyone reading this was able to determine that I will NEVER, EVER return to this restaurant, nor will I RECOMMEND IT to anyone!!!!!",

No smoke ring, no smoke. Dry. Food service grade meat per the coarse grain with the marble cooked out of it.   Fried okra; moosh. Tasteless.   Mac and cheese was tasty, but swimming bechamel.   Best thing I had was.......the Texas toast.   Visited at 7:15 pm on a Thursday. Pretty empty.   Maybe the other location(s) are up to speed but this visit reeked of par cooked nasty.",

Long a Mooresville staple,  the spacious new digs sees Lancaster's spreading south, near Exit 18 and the Northlake Mall area.  The interior is what you would expect from a southern bbq and wing joint in the heart of NC: NASCAR memorabilia, farm equipment signage such as John Deere ads, and an impressive collection of signs denoting various gasoline brands.  It definitely offers a bit of old-school charm and nostalgia, harkening back to simpler times when a community was a community and gas was well under a $1. But I digress...  The food, as always, is typical Lancasters. Great bbq, great wings. I ordered a bbq and chicken finger sammich...that's bbq with chicken on the same bun. Kind of an odd combination, but excellent.  The hush puppies are a must-order as well.  Wednesdays are Bike Night at the new location, and there are plenty of rows of video games to entertain the kids while you saddle up to the bar and talk Harley-speak with the clan that just rolled through the door.",

Our service was a little on the slow side but no ones orders were messed up and the staff is very friendly. They also have a couple BBQ sauces on the table you can try but they seemed to be mostly vinegar without a lot of character. Still not bad but definitely not great either. Price was not really cheap, I'd say more along the lines of \"moderate\" but the quality of the food was pretty good so I guess you can say it's a decent value.

Located on Beatties Ford just north of Mount Holly-Huntersville Road, it's easy to miss. There's a restaurant side and a bar side, which is where the take out area is. Very friendly staff. Ordered the chicken/pork combo and it was decent. Nothing wowed me about it, but it was pretty good. The mac & cheese side was really good though and I'd recommend that. Good place for a quick lunch and I can see why this is a 5pm place for many workers. Pork was better than the chicken, so if I go again, I'll probably just go with the pork platter.",

It is always hard to decide between the ribs, wings and pork so I have to do a combo to make it easier.  Their fried mushrooms are a must get and it tough to pick them over the o-rings b/c they're the best in the area.  Both locations have great food but the staff at the South location isn't as good as the original in Mooresville. Even when the locations look like they will be packed or there are people standing outside, there is always a table available with little to no wait, so don't drive away.  We enjoy taking family from out of state b/c they handle the large table seating requirements without delays. I believe others feel the same way and it is people like us standing around after the meal that make it look like we're waiting to be seated.",

They give you hush puupies for free and they're actully really good.    I ordered the baby back ribs/brisket combo with fried whole okra and mayo coleslaw.  This was an item labeled \"market price\" which was $18 for an August evening.  It was decent, but definitely not worth returning.  Now the okra was really tasty, but come on, its kind of hard to screw up.  The coleslaw was a bit sweet, but thats one of those things I'm just picky about, so no biggie.  But the meat - such a disappointment!  The ribs seem boiled and then tossed on the grill for browning & marking.  The brisket had grill marks on the slices and was very tough.  On the bright side they had the brown sugar/thick style bbq sauce in addition to the typical vinegar sauce.    This may be the type of place to come for a quick bbq sandwich because its close or you just don't know any better, but its definitely not the \"go to\" bbq spot.",

Unfortunately the hush puppies on the fried okra was the best part of the meal, the collard greens were over cooked and water logged and the ribs were over done as well. The meet was mush in the middle and chewy burnt on the outside look little flavor other than the sauce.   I would have rated it less but the staff and management noticed I had a problem with the meal and they were very apologetic and gave me a discount.

The fat cap on it was so thick and chewy and there was absolutely no smoke ring.  I'm pretty sure it was cooked in the oven and taken out, sliced and grilled.

What I usually get and recommend (and I have tried):  1. Open face brisket.  Yes, this I think is their best dish that they offer. It comes with 4 briskets served on 2 buns covered in gravy, mushrooms, and onions. However, my parents, and sometimes I, think that the gravy could become a little too salty. But not to fret, ask the pretty waitress for it on the side and she will graciously oblige.   2. New Orleans Chicken.  Now this one is interesting. A little tangy, spicy, and some interesting flavors mixed in with the chicken topped off with mushrooms and onions with 2 sides and a piece of bread. To me, I thought the chicken was a little dry, but that goes with all grilled type of chicken in restaurants. I have yet to find a chicken dish where the meat is succulent and where all the juice comes flowing out when you bite in it.  3. Turkey Sandwich Great dish for lunch. Comes with tomatoes and lettuce, and a good portion of turkey. If you don't want something to fill you up to the top and give you the afternoon slumber this will be the dish that calls you.  I usually get something different every time I come here so it would be interesting. I still need to try their chicken sandwiches which is probably something I will get the next time I come here.",

My friend asked me if I wanted to taste his Brisket and I course I wanted too. It was funky for a guy who has tasted Championship Brisket and this looked as though it sat in the salamander all day waiting for some poor soul from Kansas City to play a cruel joke on.   The only reason it gets one star is that the Brunswick Stew was hearty, the fried okra was excellent and not greasy, but that was pretty much it.  Here is the way I think of it. Good BBQ takes time, love and pride on the part of the pit master. You need to respect the protein and put your best offering forward every time. There was no love put into this food whatsoever and it showed in the product and the lack of enthusiasm on the part if the staff. Something is not congruent with the reviews of this place and suspect there may be some cronyism going on...",

    "text": "Beware a BBQ place where you don't smell smoke outside or in.  We were pretty underwhelmed my our dinner here.   The hush puppies were a nice start, and then we had wings.  The menu flavor we picked was \"Jamaican honey\" which just means some sort of generic, out of a bottle sweet and spicy sauce that was kind of haphazardly strewn on top of the wings.  They came with a side of fries, which were decent.  For the entree I had the brisket meal, it was ok.  Brisket was pretty tender but lots of fat.  Lots of fat.  That ended up going in an uneaten pile.  The fried okra were pretty good, but the mac and cheese was straight from a powder and not very good.  FH got the ribs, which he described as 'watery, as if they'd been boiled too long'. He didn't like them much. He had green beans, which were the old fashioned out of a can then boiled with a pork product style, and corn on the cob which was also not great per him.  I doubt we'll be back. I guess this type of place caters to a certain crowd, but it's not the kind of mouth watering amazing BBQ I want to eat when I'm in the mood for it.",

Such a good deal!  And they give you sooooo much food.   It's easily two, maybe three meals.     The service is great; I normally go with my work folks, about 8 people and they are always so accommodating.  Their customer service is some of the best around.   They bring all the sauces or \"extras\" you need, always make sure your drink is full; the basket of hushpuppies is full.  Very impressive.    The food is great too.  But I've never ventured out and tried anything other than the pork bbq (chopped).  But that vinegar sauce is real tangy.  The sides - mac & cheese, green beans, fries, homemade chips, fried WHOLE okra, corn, etc; all good.  I really cannot think of anything bad about this place.  The only thing I'd suggest is to open one up closer to me in south Charlotte.",

This review is in retrospect... Biggest atrocity of the meal: the Mac and cheese was Stouffer's! At a Southern BBQ joint, homestyle Mac should be a staple. Very disappointed by that. Next disappointment was the fried okra. In any \"meat and three\" type restaurant, the okra is chopped into bite sized pieces, then fried. Here, they just fry whole pieces of okra. Okra is a stringy, slimy vegetable. So while traditionally prepared fried okra is crisp and adheres well to its breading, Lancaster's shed its soggy breading on the first bite and you also have to deal with the stringy texture. Yuck.  The wings were ok, not as saucy as I like. A tourist would probably like the pork, but anyone familiar with Carolina BBQ would just deem it average.  Best part of the meal-Complimentary hush puppies starter.  Waitress was nice enough.",

    "text": "Kudos to Lancaster's BBQ for categorizing their brisket as what it is: brisket, not BBQ.  Past that, though, there really was not much that I could enjoy about the place.  MENU: They have the random assortment of food that most BBQ places seem to have. Salad, burgers, and pretty much everything that no one goes to a BBQ place to eat, But hey, I guess people sometimes accidentally wander into here and forget it's a BBQ place.  FOOD: I got the pork, mac and cheese, and BBQ slaw. Hush puppies are served on the side. The pork was moist, but had no smokey flavor...or any flavor of any kind. They could have prepared this in the oven for all I know. The mac and cheese tasted good, but lacked any kind of originality whatsoever. Throw some bacon on it. Top it with some herbs. Use a unique cheese. Do something, anything to separate it from the stuff from the box. The BBQ slaw was good, but I was expecting a red slaw, not a yellow one, which is more traditional to NC.  SERVICE: If there is one thing that I hate, it's greedy management that cannot be bothered to hire enough waitstaff to tend to customers. As the customer, I should not have to wait for a refill, to get my bill, or to order just because management has decided to under-staff their restaurant. The server herself was actually fairly decent, though, towards the end she decided it was more important to talk to one of her friends who was dining there than it was to bring us our bill. She did come running over to make sure that she was tipped after I left some cash and left.  Overall, the place has potential if management would spend some time and effort on the menu and start properly staffing.",

The ribs were good but the veggies did not deliver.  Bryson offered to make it right, but the damage was done.

They started at the elementary school across the street then onto the middle school further down the street and are now both in high school - again, down the street. And each morning and afternoon that I pass by, I make a mental note to stop in. But never do. Finally, after the hubs and I dropped off our kids for a high school game and were forbidden by the rugrats to attend with them (we're not cool enough, I guess) we decided to give It a try.   This place is split into two sections when you walk in. One side is a bar, some vintage arcade games and TVs for current sports. The other side is the sit down restaurant with two TVs that play old basketball games - think MJ circa 1980.   The menu is simple. All southern staples you'd expect including home made side dishes. They bring out complimentary hush puppies that were piping hot and delicious! Slightly sweet from the corn meal, It was a great starter. We ordered our meals along with more apps- chips and salsa and fried mushrooms. The salsa is home made and very flavorful. The mushrooms were freshly battered and deep fried. Didn't care too much for the mushrooms because It lacked salt and the breading got soft real fast but that's ok. Not bad for $4.   Now my meal. I chose the combo with fried chicken, bbq pork (gotta have bbq at a bbq joint!) along with green beans and collards. My $12 meal was HUGE! So much food. Definitely get your money's worth. The pork was tender and moist with a couple crunchy bits from the bbq char. Green beans were slow cooked with bacon so you get that Smokey taste in every bite. Collards were so good too! Pour on some hot sauce and vinegar and it's perfect. But the best part of It all? The fried chicken. This should be a chicken joint, not a bbq joint. That chicken SHINES!!! Deep fried to perfection, salty crispy light breading - the chicken here is like the exact replica of Price's which is saying a lot. No more bojangles run for me. Next time I want fried chicken, I'm coming here.   Customer service is also on point. Each waitress comes by to check on you at point or another. Looks like all the tables are shared, there's not one person assigned. Works for me because I can ask anyone for anything and I get It right away.   The fried mushrooms weren't great and the sides lacked a bit of salt but overall, this place has earned a new regular in me.",

    "text": "I will never forget the first time I visited my sister when she moved to Huntersville to Charlotte.  I mean, when she lived in Charlotte, we made 2 turns from her house and would end up in \"Uptown\" Charlotte.  Now, it consists of pulling off the highway, take this road for a few miles, and then that road, and then avoid the horses that may be on the road.  Needless to say, two different styles of living!  With that being said, I was on the way and just saw a bunch of houses, and then randomly, a BBQ joint, next to a martial houses/concealed carry class house.  It was quite interesting, but I knew in the back of my head this place had to special.  So, I have decided to stop here a few times over the years- and most recently last weekend with my family.  It can get pretty busy, but they do a good job keeping tables moving and there is a lot of seating here.  The servers are friendly too.  There are a few TVs to watch sports and they have merch for sale too.  The menu, it has a few things on here, and just by looking at the food come out of the kitchen, I noticed two things- the salads are served in HUGE shells, and the burgers are big size too.  But, when I am in North Carolina, I always go for the pork, or the ribs.  This time, I stuck with the pork platter.  While you wait, you get some decent hush puppies to snack on.  They have 2 different types of sauces, along with Texas Pete.  I like putting the thicker sauce on the hush puppies.  When the food came (which came pretty quickly), I couldn't wait- since its been a while that I have had Carolina pork (I usually get ribs).  Now, what I do, I like to mix all three sauces on top of the pork, and it just gave it this robust kick in my mouth- it was pretty solid explosion of flavors!  The collards had a nice zing too.  Honestly, the least memorable part was the Brunswick stew, but I am very picky when it comes to that.  I think my plate was like $11 for all of that.  We got conned into getting dessert, so I got a thing of banana pudding.  It was a nice lil cup size just enough to get me sugar dizzy.  I liked the crunch and the creaminess in there.    From my sisters house, I think this may be one of the closest places to get food (at least I know it is when travelling south on Beatties Ford)- and that is not a bad problem to have.  Need to make more visits here and get my pork fix!",

I recently discovered the Hawaiian chicken salad in a taco shell bowl with a delicious teriyaki glaze, pineapple slice and barbecue chicken. Try it with ranch dressing and see if you can keep from eating the entire taco shell bowl. My husband can't enough of the wings and pulled pork combo. He's always game for whatever is on special and their chicken tenders with a double side of okra is one of my favorites. Great local beer selection and local patrons.

The food is very home style with simple decor and plastic plates. This isn't a date night but great for families.   The first impression is always positive from the staff. The next welcome is with these fried cornbread things that really make you hungry. They are also nice to try all of the sauces on the table.   We've tried a few things here and the redneck nachos along with the chicken tenders are the highlights. Dang those nachos.... with the brisket... and melted cheese... oh dang! These are also fun since you can pick your meat and cheese option (we did brisket and cheddar).  The chicken tenders seem to be made in house, no overly seasoned breading here!  The BBQ'd meats have been good. The brisket is juicy and has a good flavor. The chicken is also a win.   As for sides, we've really liked everything expect the Mac and cheese. The okra, collards, and slaw can jump on my plate anyway!",

The pulled pork is my favorite in Charlotte. Now onto the fried chicken. The chicken is cooked to order so you will have to wait for it about 15 minutes. However I promise you that it is worth the wait. You can have the fried chicken plain or dipped. I suggest you DIP it. The only time I don't dip it is when I have take-out, which means the dip is on the side. When you order the fried chicken dipped there are three heat level options. The chicken is crispy and juicy every time and I only do the white meat. The fried chicken remains crispy even after it is dipped. Some places once they dip it it goes soggy. I believe they maintain the crispness because each piece is freshly fried and then dipped. This means the dip is part of the cooking process.  The hushpuppies are good and additive. The sides are tasty as well. They always have some type of specials which may differ if dining in or taking out. There is also a separate bar. As you can see I will return.",

I seem to recall that the fish fillets were better tasting and better seasoned years ago. I seem to recall that the portions were larger too. It seems like now that they've gotten more popular they just kind of throw things together. It's still good food.

Given the frequency of our take out orders, it's clear we like this place. Great barbecue, fried chicken, ribs, hush puppies, fried pickles and mushrooms. Even the cobb salad served in the fried shell is delicious (ask for the grilled chicken to be dipped in bbq sauce). And until very recently, they had the best dill potato salad you'll ever find. It's the new recipe change for their potato salad that prevents me from giving them 4 stars. Why change something that isn't broken? Their original potato salad was distinctive because it contained a strong dill flavor, and it may or may not have contained finely diced pickles. The flavors were so unique, and obviously, delicious.   For some reason, the owner has decided to change the recipe to a bland, dill-less, potato salad. My spouse was stunned when he ordered 2 quarts ($20, so not cheap) for his office's Christmas potluck (as he had done for multiple office potlucks over the years). Several noticed the change, and the response was overwhelmingly negative. They too had all come to love the unique, dill potato salad.  I'm sure we'll keep eating at Lancaster's. I'll just have to find a new side. Because the new recipe is not cutting it.",

He said the ribs were pretty good, but the wings were some of the best he's ever had. We shared the banana pudding for dessert- one word: AMAZING.

Once we were seated, it took over 8 minutes for the waitress to even say hi, and take our drink order.  We weren't in a hurry so that by itself wasn't an issue, but the slow, inattentive service continued.  We ordered the bbq plate and the half chicken plate.  The bbq and chicken were both good.   Neither was the best I've had, but both good.  The sides on the other hand were a whole lot of meh.  Between the service and sides, you can do better at other BBQ places in the area.",

The place is cute....and the dining area almost windowless.....(NOTE:  can anyone tell me why most BBQ places in NC have either tiny windows or no windows at all??????)  The bar is where I ate and was bright and had plenty of seating.  The bartender gave me a menu and I ordered a small BBQ plate with chips.  Small was a lot of food and as for the chips...if you have someone with you just get 1 order as there are a ton of them and enough for two people to eat.  I got the cajun chips though I couldn't tell the spice was on them.  The BBQ was very good and the Eastern sauce was even better.  Throw in a few beers and this place would be 5 stars if they just had an outdoor eating area vs. just a place to smoke.",

BBQ was very good, but my sides were just alright. Brunswick stew just wasn't very hearty or flavorful. Not that i order it all the time, but it's the first time i've ever seen it served on a plate and not in a cup or bowl. My other side was the mashed potatoes and gravy which were a little better.   They start you off with a nice basket of hush puppies which were pretty tasty. Always a bonus when i get food just for sitting down. We ordered the fried mushrooms before we knew hush puppies were coming, but i'm glad we did. They were served with ranch and done just right in a way where the mushroom didn't just fall out of it's fried shell when you take a bite. It was a great value for the half basket ($3).  The location is not that far from from the Northlake Mall area, but far enough away that i'm not sure we'll end up here again.",

The staff was great.  Super nice.    Hush Puppies are complementary while you wait for your food.  I got a combo plate with 1/4 Fried Chicken and BBQ Brisket.  Yum.  The fried chicken was crispy and moist.  It was very simple coating, probably just flour, salt and pepper.  Nothing special.  The brisket was great.  I don't think I even went to grab for the sauce.  Just ate it with what it came with.  My friends loved their food too.  Prices are pretty decent.",

I've been here several times before and knew this would be a safe bet to give them a taste of Carolina Q without having to go far after a long day at work.  First group was last week and 4 of us sampled a wide variety of offerings from the menu.  They thought the fried pickles were the strangest thing they had ever seen on a menu and had to try them. They could not stop eating them and raving about how good they were.  (I like them too)  Thoroughly impressed with the BBQ across the board as I knew they would be. A great time was had by all.  Well the second group comes into town this week and yes, had heard all about the food/experience from the first group and insisted we had to go.  And the fried pickles were the first thing that asked about and ordered.  Again, a great meal and overall experience was had by all.  I guess this has now become a regular spot for whenever they come over for a visit.  As I said above, I have been here before and Lancaster's is on my \"regular rotation\" of BBQ spots.  I've never been disappointed.  Very casual with good food and always great service.   Prices are very reasonable too.  Check it out.",

    "text": "We ordered a brisket dinner and a \"jumbo\" brisket sandwich as take out from here so I can only comment on these two dishes and not on their service. The brisket slices are chewy and have actual grill marks on the flat sides, which tells me that it didn't spend much time in a smoker for the fat to render and was probably cooked/reheated on a grill and then covered in sauce. I think that violates more than a few BBQ rules around prep and flavor.....The \"jumbo\" brisket sandwich we ordered is nothing more than three slices of brisket between some buttered toast with some slaw throw on for some odd reason. Not how I would prepare or present a \"jumbo\" sandwich. Also, the collard greens were downright bad. I know that brisket is not really a strong point of Carolina BBQ, so I might give this place another chance to try the pork. Otherwise I'll probably look elsewhere for BBQ.",

    "text": "In the mood for some tasty BBQ so I headed here for lunch. The place is clean and spacious. They gave us a basket of hush-puppies and they were the best I've ever tasted. I ordered the special: pork and 5 wings plus 2 sides for $9. I asked for all flats, extra wet for the wings. I got mostly flats but no sauce. They were still good even without the sauce. Our waitress, Jayme, was top-notch: super friendly and very attentive. She brought me some sauce and kept the refills coming. The pork was very tasty. I ordered onion rings and homemade potato chips for my sides and they were excellent! My hubby ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and Mac 'n cheese. He said they were okay. He didn't care for the Mac 'n cheese because it tasted like velveeta. Next time, I'll try the brisket. I highly recommend.",

    "text": "After a visit to the 2nd Annual NC Brewers & Music Festival, we happened to see this little BBQ place and decided to give it a try.  We were glad we did!  There were a few regulars & families eating in the restaurant seating area, as well as the separate bar area.  After looking over the extensive menu, hubby opted for the fried mushroom appetizer, and the bbq plate w/chicken wings & mac & cheese.  I had the chopped bbq sandwich & fries (extra crispy).  The sandwich was so big I took half home!  Loved the option of 2 different sauces as well.  The service was delightful and friendly, with your typical small southern town clientele.  Loved the complimentary hush puppies too!  Definitely stop in this place if you're in the area, or feel like a nice drive outside of Charlotte for some good BBQ and company.",
