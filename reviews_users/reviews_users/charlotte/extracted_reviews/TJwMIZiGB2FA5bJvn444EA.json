It was actually a piece of chicken with some type of sweet brown sugar coating.  It was not good at all and did not resemble Nashville Hot in any way.  I would rename it \"Nashville Not\"!

The place is so cozy, and the staff was very nice both times.   I tried both the burger and meatloaf. The meatloaf was excellent. It is very uncommon to find a high-end kitchen that services such a homemade taste meatloaf. The burger on the other hand tasted was okay, nothing special about it.  They have really good selection of Cocktails and beer, which made both experiences really good. The cocktails are really fantastic. I ended up trying 3 on my first visit.  In conclusion, It is a really nice place for a work lunch, or casual date. Nothing special about the menu, or the food. I am sure you will find something you like on the menu. However, if not for the food, you must go and try the cocktails.",

The guy in training was awesome and super attentive but the waitress who was serving us neglected our table on more than one account. First off, it took 30-40 minutes upon our arrival just for her to take our drink orders. Then another 30 minutes to bring us our drinks. Then it took her another 20-30 minutes to take our order. When someone asked how the Mac and cheese was, her response was \"personally, I like velveeta better\". I don't mind waiting for my food-- It was delicious!! Except my friend got a side of fries and they were definitely old fries that were reheated. She brought us our checks and probably thought her night was done.  The reservation was for a BIRTHDAY. She didn't even offer the dessert menu or anything special for our friends birthday and then when I went to ask if there was any way I could order cake to surprise my friend, her response was a rude \"no, the kitchen is closed\". What should have been a fun hour and a half birthday dinner ended up being a 3 hour overpriced meal for shitty service. I've worked 5 years in the food and bev industry and honestly I would rather have received service from the guy in training!",

It took 40 mins for the server to even notice we were sitting down so when we moved to the bar to see if the service would be quicker the bartender decided to just give us a dumbfound look and continue serving everyone but us.

    "text": "This place is kind of awesome. I didn't have a cocktail I didn't love and the food was top notch. The dishes are delicious with local Carolina ingredients and they are different than traditional preparation - such as nonfried calamari. You can tell there's a southern inspiration behind their dishes which is a nice tribute to the area but they are also tweaked to doubly appeal to the Charlotte transplants. Fantastic location. Perfect interior decor with the historic brick and exposed joists. I enjoyed the staircase and appropriate chandelier at the entryway.   Quick hitters: -I love the Lake Wylie cocktail - bourbon based, egg white for extra body, with lemon and sweetness. Can't beat it -House-made Caesar is really good and the croutons are from their bread we all love (genius) -The house-made pimiento is great (fried tomatoes were a hit) -Shrimp n grits are creamy for a change and awesome -North Carolina Trout is soo good, chicken is as moist as I've ever had, and flank steak is money -MUST GET: Sticky bun!! It's unbelievable. There's even a dab of ice cream on it! This is my new late night secret...which isn't likely to be a secret very long",

Very lively ambiance in general. Great energy!  My bartender was Alex. She was so sweet and provided impeccable service!  I got 3 small plates because I wanted to try different things. Favorite item was spicy garlic shrimp. The sauce on them was amazing! The wedge salad was also awesome--very fresh ingredients. The deviled eggs were also yummy. Each one is topped with a fried oyster, so they were definitely decadent but well worth it!  And of course I left Alex talk me into the chocolate cake for dessert, although I honestly didn't need much convincing, and it was worth every calorie!  Had a really great time here, I'll likely make it back before I head home!",

I immediately noticed and loved the atmosphere - dark, rustic, dropped lighting, etc. I also noticed the vast bourbon selection behind the bar!  The bartender was nice and seemed like he desperately wanted to be knowledgeable, but when I changed glasses of wine, he poured the new wine in the old glass. Ugh. He also told us the calamari and fried green tomatoes were their best sellers, so we took his advice. I gotta say, I wasn't too impressed. The calamari was pretty rubbery, and the fried green tomatoes were really heavily battered, so all they tasted like were breading. Thankfully, the pimento cheese on top helped save them.  I SO appreciated that the downstairs bar had hooks for purses, but I also found the stools pretty awkward since I kept sliding out of them, and they wouldn't turn all the way so that my friend and I could face each other. We wound up having to get up to physically turn the whole chair.   I'll definitely give 204 North another chance since I desperately want them to succeed. Uptown needs a nice restaurant like this at this price point ($54 for 4 glasses of wine and 2 appetizers).",

I went with the Banker for my drink and my husband got a Wicked Weed Beer. The Banker was their version of an Old Fashion. Nicely made. We settled on the calamari as an appetizer. Nice portion. I liked that the calamari wasn't deep fried, as that is usually how I see restaurants serve calamari. Instead it was served grilled in a tasty sauce.

I was surprised it wasn't more crowded when we went for Brunch, but it may have just been the time or specific day. The interior is clean and spacious and the wait staff is tentative to your needs. I ordered eggs with bacon and potatoes as well as French toast. The food was amazing and came out pretty fast, but I would have thought it would have been faster considering the amount of people eating at the time. The portions were good and everything was well seasoned and hot. If they had a nice mimosa special I would give them a 5 - obviously mimosas at brunch are a necessity for me lol. Across from the. At they have a chalk board with all the specials beautifully written and a story about the drink named Amazing Grace. When you read it l, it will truly touch your heart. Oh and whatever you do - GET THE FRIED OYSTER DEVILED EGGS!!!! They are the best thing since sliced bread and if you eat here and don't get them are you really even eating ?!",

    "text": "Just came here for a work dinner. Overall, a really decent restaurant. The atmosphere is cozy, a bit trendy, but still very inviting.   I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken, which was pretty good - nothing to write home about, because it was a bit on the dry side and the chicken coating kept separating from the chicken.  The Mac and Cheese side was also pretty bland. Would not recommend.  The Brussel Sprouts on the other hand are highly recommended. They are very sweet, so be ready for that, but are really delicious! I would loved to have had 2 orders of Brussels instead of my Mac and cheese.  The beer and cocktail list is pretty extensive with lots of local beer options.  Overall a solid choice for a work dinner, but nothing to go out of your way for.",

We were seated immediately.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer.  The waitress promptly brought out our drinks and bread with the most delicious homemade butter!  For an appetizer we split the cheese and charcuterie board between four people.  It was expensive but a good portion for the value.  I was craving something unhealthy so we split the buffalo chicken mac and cheese.  It was good!  The portion was enough for us to split.    This restaurant is farm to table which is a plus because there aren't many places like this in charlotte.   This is a Good Friday night date spot!!!",

Was just disappointed that there was never an acknowledgement of the celebration. A note was made on the reservation that this was a birthday dinner. Also, when someone from the party asked the waitress if we could do a dessert or something to celebrate- She was told the kitchen was closed and felt uncomfortable for even asking. (This was even before 10 PM when the restaurant closes at 12)  Overall, seems like a nice place to come for a casual dinner or drinks, but probably not to celebrate a birthday.",

The staff was extremely friendly and gave us great service even though our table was large and all on separate checks.   We all started with drinks of course, and they did not disappoint. They have a slushy alcoholic drink in an actual slushy machine behind the bar that's delish and so stylish looking. They run drink specials too.   I ordered the avocado toast and the mint chocolate waffles and I died and went to heaven. The waffles had so much flavor and were such a nice breakfast treat. The avocado toast wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't bad. My friend ordered the Benedict, and she said it was awesome.   204 is a little fancier and more pricey for dinner, but brunch was reasonable. I had dinner  reservations here and their menu looked great, but had to cancel due to an illness. They were very understanding and followed up via email which was a nice personal touch.",

No shocker there. Our waitress was patient, as we had no idea what to order. She suggested vanilla French toast when asked her choice between Chicken & waffles OR Shrimp & grits. You read that correctly.  After careful deliberation, my friend ordered shrimp & grits. I had the chicken & waffles. Friend wasn't impressed with the SGs. Only 4 shrimp and too many peppers to make up for the lack of shrimp. The Tasso gravy was creative.  I liked my chicken and waffles much better. The chicken was Unique in taste and seemed to have been marinated in a pickled flavoring overnight. It was a sweet vinegary taste in the meat. However, the skin was its own combo of spices. Nothing spicy. Waffles, (3 quarters of a waffle.... Thought that was peculiar) were basic.  Friend had the Ballantyne cocktail. VERY good. Tasted like a less sweet daiquiri to me. Great service. Nice venue. Give it a shot.",

The fish was not available and instead of telling us politely and apologetically, we were told, \"we have shrimp instead of fish today\". Huh?

My favorites are the Ballantyne with the fresh strawberries and mint and also the Plaza Milwood with strawberry, mango, and spiced rum. They will switch out liquors if you prefer like vodka for gin. Cocktails are a flat $12 and is a great price considering the fresh ingredients used. I haven't eaten here yet but I know I'll be back for sure!",

However, they were not too appetizing. They were warm in some sections and cold in others. There was one little spoonful of a thick pimento cheese that was not as flavorful as I would have expected. It was topped with a small slice of deli style ham but would have been better if the ham was thick diced and caramelized or replaced it with bacon. In the end we decided not to order our dinner here.

While a smaller restaurant, it's located in the perfect place. I would also recommend this restaurant for parties and large groups. Our company holiday party was here and the custom menu they created for us was incredible.",

The bread is super hard but the lemon butter is flavorful.   We were kind of turned off by the service last night and will probably never come back.   Drinks were decent but some seem to be underserved or the glasses were too big. Maybe that the place has only been open for 7 days.    Still can't believe how gross the calamari was, very bland and super rubbery.  Definitely over cooked and even said that this was disgusting when the server came over but she ignored it.",

He also acknowledged that the $24 was too high and blamed it on their computer system. Said he would correct it. He also said,\"we're new here\". Like that should matter???   He said he would send me a gift card or something, to which I said, was not necessary but he insisted.  Just for the record, the gift card never arrived. Lost in the mail?...maybe. Doubt it! Bad eats!!! These are not good business people. Stay away.",

The kitchen knows what they're doing with execution and seasoning. From a creativity standpoint, I give it a 7 out of 10.. the dishes were thoughtfully conceived without being mind-blowing. Service was very good; they handled our large party very well and graciously split the checks without being asked.",

For the entree I had the shrimp and grits it was good but wanted a little more shrimp but had a really good flavor. One of my coworkers had the meatloaf delicious, not what you would expect a little spice but not over powering, the green beans were crisp and the mashed potatoes were really good. I had a side spinach salad and it was so good! Was not saturated in salad dressing really fresh and just enough of the feta, grapes, walnuts and ham.. although it tasted like pancetta. And the Brussel sprouts loved them! For dessert I couldn't make up my mind so my coworker and I split the cheese cake and sticky bun.. he cheese cake was good but not what I expected no crust on it, had a really good flavor melt in your mouth.. the sticky bun and whiskey ice cream... well that was definitely a dessert left me wanting more. This is definitely a place I will be coming back to in Charlotte NC.",

The atmosphere is simple and easy, and the staff is better than most uptown place. If you love calamari, you must try it here. The meatloaf is surprisingly light and the chicken was really good  of mashed potatoes  and tasso au jois. I dare u to not LOVE the key lime pie. I hope you ask for Allie she was a gem.",

We went there for dinner on a Saturday and had a reservation but it wasn't super crowded so we probably would've been okay without one. The manager sat us at our table and started chatting with us when we sat down. She was SO fun and bubbly and we hit it off with her immediately. She brought us free drinks and kept checking in with us throughout the night. She gave us her business card at the end of the night so we could stay in touch. She definitely made the whole experience more fun and we loved chatting with her! Our waitress was very nice too - the service in general was fantastic. The food was also very good - I had the beet salad and I enjoyed it immensely. The calamari was also a hit, as was the salmon and the berry cobbler for dessert. I don't have a single bad thing to say about this restaurant; it was fun and delicious and a wonderful evening all around. 100% definitely recommend 204 North!",

    "text": "I am posting the email I had tried sending to management after our Holiday party at this establishment.  We never received any kind of acknowledgment.  I would definitely advise against having a party here, your guests will walk away hungry and annoyed.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  First email sent:  \"Hi Kristin,  I just wanted to follow up with you post party.  I know you guys are  a new restaurant and still working out kinks so I would rather address with you before posting a yelp review.    We definitely appreciated your help beforehand setting up our details, however we had the following issues.  * We were not able to order from the bar and had to wait a very long time (30-40 minutes) to order drinks from our waiters.  When trying to order from the bar we were scolded that we were not supposed to and had to order from our waiters. * Food came out very unorganized and without serving utensils.  We had to ask for food to come out (we would have liked the food all at once) and our oysters were forgotten about.  They were not brought out until the very end after we asked about them. Most people in our party didn't even know there were oysters. * No one ever came around to pick up dirty dishes or glasses so our table was filled with dirty dishes by the end of the party. * The sticky buns were very under cooked and doughy. * Several people remarked that they constantly had to flag down waiters because they were not checking on us and then waited a very long time for drinks to come out. * Waiters were also not very friendly and seemed overwhelmed, (may have been due to inadequate coverage) given the amount of money we spent overall including food, drinks, and tip.  We did have fun overall as a group, but wanted to bring these things to your attention as many of us left feeling a bit upset by the service we received.  Appreciate your consideration!\"  Follow up email:  \"Hi Team,  I have not heard back so wanted to loop you in as well.    After speaking with my managers we also wanted to mention that at $18.00 per person we could have each ordered an entree, but most people left hungry.  We were told beforehand \"Depending on what appetizer package you go with we would be sure that there is more than enough food for you and your guests.\", but this was not delivered.  A response would be appreciated.\"",

But the food is just ok. $7 for a side of fries (that are not even good) is absurd. We had a beet salad which was good but the crispy oyster appetizer was overpriced for the portion. My husband had the burger which he enjoyed but the rest of us got the flounder and the trout. Both dishes had zero flavor and I don't see how this could be a side effect of being so new. I'll go back to try other items bc I really want to like this place as places like this are much needed in Uptown.",

They were out of Cheerwine so they weren't able to make their Southern Sipper cocktail but the server recommended something else which was fine. We ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes as our appetizer and then a few minutes later the waiter came back to let us know they were also out of fried green tomatoes... They brought a replacement appetizer out which was fine but a bit disappointing.  The worst part of the evening was when we both were out of water. We asked the gentleman who brought our food out to bring us refills but he never returned... We also asked a manager, but he must have forgotten too. Finally the waiter brought us refills but by this point we were both done with our meals and parched. We then ended up having to wait another 30 minutes for dessert - which isn't even cooked in house so I'm not sure why it took so long. The manager did deliver our dessert, apologized and gave us a small discount off of our meal, which we did appreciate, but I wish she had asked for feedback on our experience because she seemed to only be aware of the wait for our dessert and not all the other issues we faced. I will say our waiter was very apologetic and seemed to be trying.",

The three of us were immediately seated upstairs. The first dissapoint of the night was our server. Her personality was more suited to someone working the drive through window at a fast food place. My favorite drink of the night was the Ballantyne. I didn't care for the Dilworth. Really overpowering cucumber flavor. The pork belly app was just ok. Not bad but I've had better at other restaurants. The entrees were the burger, flat iron steak and meatloaf. Again food was ok but nothing to make me order it again. I assume the long wait for food was due to it being saturday night. The burger was ordered medium but arrived well done. When we asked the server she said their burger is too thin patties and only comes well done. Not sure why she would ask how we wanted it and then say after there is no option.  I'm a huge dessert person so I was really really hoping they would pull through. Nope. The sticky bun with whiskey ice cream was turned down by all three of us. It is not at all the ooey gooey soft cinnamon roll you imagine. It's a plain hard roll that is drizzled in an over powering sauce. The ice cream was interesting but in no way made up for the rest. This is not a cheap place either so the bill was an extra sting given our experience. I might stop in for a drink because of the chill crowd it attracts but there a much better restaurants near by.",

We sat at a small two-top near the window, but I am excited to go back one evening soon and sit at the bar - the bar stools looked super comfy and the bar itself looked well-stocked. We both commented on how we loved the decor and the general feel of the place.  My friend and I each ordered the 3 taco lunch deal, which is 3 tacos and a side for $10. That price is pretty hard to beat and everything was delicious. Between the two of us, we tried all of the tacos. I especially loved that they don't skimp on the cotija cheese.  Overall the food and the service were both great. Looking forward to going back for dinner and drinks!",

The host offered a prefixe menu and it seemed that the restaurant may not have been prepared to handle the large order. The food was good, but our entrees and desserts came out cooked very differently. For example, several people at the table ordered the sticky bun and several were over cooked (to the point you couldn't eat the outside layer because it was so hard) and a few came out undercooked. There was also a significant wait time between ordering and the food being served. I didn't try many restaurants while I was in Charlotte but suspect that you can find better options for dinner.",

We started with the deviled eggs topped with fried oysters and shared a side of Brussel sprouts. My boyfriend got the Nashville Hot Chicken with Mac and Cheese and Coleslaw. It was pretty good. The best item we had was my 204 North Cheeseburger. I have to say that was probably one of the best cheeseburgers I have ever had. I would not normally pick  American cheese for a burger, but the cheese they used was melt in your mouth. Paired with good quality bread, it was an amazing burger. My fries weren't fresh and didn't have much parmesan, but I am sure when they are made fresh they are great!   Good service, atmosphere and drink selection. Will definitely be back for that burger!",

I had a pasta entre with pork belly that was crispy and delicious. Amazing red sauce. Our service was absolutely incredible, Leandra was super helpful and was extremely knowledgeable on the area. She gave us recommendations in the area and from someone being new to Charlotte, this was impressive. Also, we just came from a Halloween event at the science center and my husband had a skeleton make up on, nobody blinked an eye. We tried a place down the street that a guy gawfed at us and told us they were closing. This place is a welcome and amazing place.",

While I loved the Wild Mushroom Ravioli I ordered for my appetizer, the Salmon I tried for my main course was dry and flavorless, and the Pork Tenderloin my wife ordered just wasn't particularly memorable.   For dessert, my wife ordered the Turtle Cheesecake, which was just OK, and I finished off a forgettable Creme Brulee. The high points of the meal were the excellent service and the extensive beer and wine selection, complete with a number of local craft brews on tap.   I really wanted to like 204 North, but unless our recent dinner experience was an aberration, I wouldn't recommend it for anything more than after-hour cocktails and munchies.",

    "text": "This is a Restaurant Week review and I warn this because I understand that this isn't always the best representation of a restaurant due to higher demand and limited menus. With that being said you always should completely fail... and I was quite disappointed with my experience.   I'll start by saying we had a very stranger servers who I think had smoked some serious weed prior to her shift. She was completely spaced out and made some very strange and off putting comments.   I was at dinner with two friends and we came to do the RW menu. We were interested in doing some wine and we were able to order glasses when the server came back because she remembered there were specials on bottle that night. We changed our order to a bottle and then the server disappeared for what felt like forever. When she returns she explains that the restaurant doesn't have enough glasses so it took her forever. (Over share from a server and makes the restaurant look bad) Then she realized one was dirty and left to find another one. We finally had the wine poured and placed our order.   I ordered the fried green tomato app which was over sauced and the flavors clashed. I ordered a second course of Shrimp and Grits and when it arrived I had no silverware because mine were taken from the first course. The server took forever to come back so by the time I got silverware my food was cold. Then I had ordered creme burlee for dessert, as well as another gust at the table, but after dinner they told us they were out of it. I expressed my frustration because it was one of my main reasons for picking this restaurant. They brought me a menu to order something else but then two creme burlees showed up to the table.   Needless to say when the check arrived it was split up wrong as well because like I have explained all aspects of service were pretty awful.   I feel that this place needs to refine its food and service if they are going to try to play with the big dogs in Uptown. There are so many interesting fun places that are competing with them and they need to step up their game!",

Well, already we were met with a very unhappy host. Not very friendly at all. We wanted to change our tables and apparently the hostess didn't really like that. Well I'm sorry my fiance has a bad back and prefers some support...  We had to grab our own menus and moved to the new table.   We spent a few minutes looking over the menu and finally decided only to find out that we were given the lunch menu along with the dinner menu. Not our fault. So had to take more time to decide what we wanted.  Food took longer than I liked and when it came out it was semi warm. I don't know about you guys but I'd like my mash potatoes to be more than warm.  I got the meatloaf and they tasted like mushy hamburger patties with a crust... so yea not my favorite.  When we made a comment about the hostess earlier, her co worker just said she wasn't having a good day. Keep your personal stuff to yourself when you're at work and if youre sick stay home. Bad customer service is not what you want to be giving to people.  AND I dont know if this has anything to do with it.. but we were the only Asian folks up in the joint.  Never will come back here again and would have gave 0 stars if I could.",

To be fair, the food was tasty, not amazing but average and the decor and atmosphere were cool. With that said the service for Father's Day had much to be desired. It wasn't crowded so that wasn't the issue. There was no Father's Day greeting from either the waitresses or host. And when our kids ages 10-13 wanted milk it was met with rolled eyes and hesitation. We were checked on twice during the entire meal, so water was constantly out and had to wait on the bill for close to 10 minutes. We wouldn't go back purely because the service was so bad. Not sure if this was an isolated incident and I don't want to mention our waitress's name in the case she was having a bad day. In Charlotte, there are simply too many options to not go the extra mile to earn a better review.",

Two years ago I came here for New Year's Eve and had a great experience. Unfortunately, we decided to come back this year. This was by far one the worst service experiences I've ever had in my life. There was a fixed menu and we were here for over 3 hours. Our service was practically nonexistent but it wasn't that crowded. It took about 20-30 minutes to get a drink. We asked for several things (wine glasses, extra napkins, water) that we never received. The food was decent but nothing incredible. I wish I had better things to say but I'll think twice before I come here next time.",

    "text": "This was a gamble. Reading past reviews, I was going into this week's date night with The Lady a little wary, aware of the amount of \"meh\" that was in previous reviews. But...I came here anyways. And I'm really glad that I did. We walked in at 7:15 on a Friday (with a reservation), and there were plenty of tables available. The space is gorgeous, with a super cool chandelier and leather and wood and all that cool trendy stuff. Whoever designed this place knew what they were doing. We went up to the hostess stand and were offered our choice of high top upstairs or booth downstairs, and we chose downstairs.Our waitress showed up quickly, and helped us make cocktail decisions. For me, the Wesley Heights (a delicious and well crafted dark and stormy with some secret sauce? Still don't know what that is....) and The Lady got the Ballantyne (Thanks, Yelp! She loved it!). The cocktail menu is extensive and creative, and there's even one with absinthe (so you can enjoy your meal with the green fairy). For dinner, I got the Pork Chop that was served over some sort of corn/bean mixture. Everything was amazing. Warning to those who order, the center of the pork chop is on the verge of rare, but it's warm and perfectly tender. The Lady ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese, which she described pretty well as \"heaven\". HUGE chunks of lobster. So worth the price.  We were stuffed, but we took the suggestion of yelp to get the sticky bun, so we ordered it to go. I'd give this place a 4.5 if I could. Our waitress was wonderful, water filled and very attentive, and food was delicious. No hesitations on trying out 204 North.",

    "text": "Really enjoyed our Christmas dinner here with my daughters. The salmon was pretty good, though it was a little too pink on the inside and was a bit less than warm there. The roasted beats felt more like canned beets. There was no evidence of it actually having been roasted. The warm Brussels Sprouts Salad was so disappointing)-:  The sprouts were soggy. They tasted as if they were nuked in the microwave and then drowned in the dressing. The addition of the poached pear should have been an excellent pairing for the cheese and bacon. Instead, my salad had a fresh, sliced Asian pear. No poaching included. The salad was just an epic fail. Maybe pan roast the sprouts to enhance the flavor and leave it with a bit of crunch. If you're not going to poach the pears, then add them to the pan of sprouts with sweet onion and fresh ground pepper? Now, what was delicious and prepared perfectly? The pork chop, the devilled eggs and the she crab bisque. The bisque was light with a fresh flavor that let the crab shine front and center. No overwhelming spices or dense cream. The sweetness of the crab shone through. And those eggs? Perfection! I'm a devilled egg snob and these eggs exceeded all expectations. A mustardy base with the perfect amount of salt. The fried oyster on top gave it a fabulous crunch and expanded taste palate. My only complaint? I wanted more of that yummy tomato jelly that the egg sat on. Omg, it was delicious. Lastly, the pork chop was perfectly seasoned and cooked with a deliciously soft pink center. You could almost cut it with a fork. It was that tender!  Our servers were wonderful and kept the Sweet Tea and Arnold Palmers coming.",

I love how the cocktails were all named after different neighborhoods in Charlotte! I ordered the Lake Norman and he ordered the Ballantyne. The Lake Norman is your typical vodka cranberry with a twist of Cointreau and lime. It was strong, but refreshing, and it looked gorgeous! I'm not a fan of gin, but my husband let me try the Ballantyne and it wasn't too bad! He really enjoyed it though. They used actual strawberries and mint in his drink so it tasted very fresh. Our bartender was very sweet! She was getting ready to close, so we didn't get to talk too much, but she did give us suggestions for places to visit while in town and gave us a sample of her favorite beer (which ended up being our favorite beer of the trip!).",

    "text": "I had been here once before on their Whiskey Wednesday for a liquor promotion, so I didn't have the opportunity to try any of the beautiful cocktails the bartender was preparing.  I instantly noticed the beautiful interior, clean open space and farmhouse chic feel.  I came back here on a Friday night to kick off girl's night out with a great meal and cocktail.  Overall, we were underwhelmed.  My girls ordered simple cocktails, gin & soda and vodka and cranberry, and neither of them had any complaints.  I tried their \"La Reina\" as I typically like Mezcal.  The presentation was great - the drink was a beautiful cherry orange color with a cinnamon covered orange as garnish.  However, it was pretty smokey for my liking.  It tasted like they had poured liquid smoke into the drink, which is great for some, but I could've gone without it.  It may have been a certain type of Mezcal I've not had before, but in the end, I paid $12 for a drink I had maybe 4 sips out of, and neither of our waiters asked if it tasted fine or if I'd like something different.  We decided to split a few small plates.  We ordered the Carnitas Mac-n-Cheese, Parmesan Fries, Roasted Brussel Sprouts and the Cheese and Charcuterie plate.  The Mac-n-Cheese boasted a gigantic bowl of cheesy pasta, with tiny scraps of meat you had to search for and a tiny bit of pico de gallo on top, which was the main draw on the menu description.  The waiter promptly brought out an extra side of pico when I requested one though, and it's a good thing because it really makes the dish.  The lime flavor on the Mac was a great flavor combo.  The Charcuterie plate was beautifully put together, and it had a great selection of drizzled oil, hummus and sauce to dip the items in.  There were two different stronger marbled cheeses, thin salty meats, grapes walnuts and candied pecans.  Overall, it was pretty great.  The Brussels were covered in some sort of a sweet sauce and were delicious.  They weren't as crispy as some I've had, but they were a hit at the table.  The Parmesan Fries were nothing to write home about.  Overall, it's a beautiful venue and the waitstaff were friendly, but the food and drinks weren't as special as we'd hoped and we probably won't be back to dine here often.",

    "text": "I scoured Yelp & TripAdvisor for a local, [somewhat high-end] wedding anniversary dinner and landed on 204 North after a recommendation from my coworker.  (Furthermore, this was one of the only places I could narrow day that was open on a Sunday evening.) I made reservations at 7pm to be safe, but there were plenty of open tables when we arrived at 6:45pm.  We were seated right away and were given the choice between a high top or regular table.  Our server was attentive, informative, and very friendly.  My husband and I both ordered the wedge salad- which was amazing! Delicious blue cheese dressing (which is a major thumbs up in my book). My husband doesn't like blue cheese or crumbles and the server happily substituted the dressing.  He went on to order the hot chicken, which he said was \"good\". He validated by saying he would order it again. I got the meatloaf, which is typically out of my wheelhouse but thought I would try something new. I was pleasantly surprised! It comes over a bed of mashed potatoes which I almost substituted for macaroni and cheese but opted for the potatoes after some guidance from our server. (I'm a huge mac-in-cheese girl and have some pretty steep expectations. After tasting some of my hubby's mac, I'm very glad I kept the potatoes.  Not bad- just not amazing.) The meatloaf comes with a light gravy, which again- isn't something I normally go for, but it was the perfect touch...it really complemented the meat! We wrapped up with another glass of wine(for me) and craft beer(for him) and a brownie to-go. The brownie was obviously good, but probably would have been warm and more decadent had we eaten it during our meal.  We were just so stuffed!   My hubby and I are ALWAYS looking for local restaurants that balance a good atmosphere and good food, and 204 North has certainly achieved that balance.  It felt very \"Charleston\"-the way the exterior is tucked very discretely within the heart of uptown- with exposed brick, and a southern inspired menu. We will certainly be back and honestly am considering hosting a party upstairs some time! Lovely experience!",

    "text": "Some girlfriends and I checked out 204 North during Yelp restaurant week (March 2018). The atmosphere was really cute and trendy and the menu looked amazing. We ordered 3 appetizers, entrees and sides. The food was both a hit and a miss. Here's why:  Appetizers: Deviled Eggs with a Fried Oyester, Fried Green Tomatoes, Callimari  The appetizers were nice, but nothing extroidinary. The Callimari was the most dissappointing. No unique take or twist and the marinara sauce it was served with was definitely canned. The fried green tomatoes tasted good, and I love a good deviled egg. Theae did have their own twist with the friend oyester on top which we all really liked.   Entrees: Salmon with Truffle Potatoes and Beets in Sorghum   AMAZING. The portion was generous and SO delicious. The truffle potatoes were heaven and I could've eaten those beets forever. The salmon was a generous size and all in all this was the BEST thing. All of my friends agreed that their entrees were the best prepared amongst our orders.  Sides: Mac and Cheese and Brussel Sprouts  These were terrible. They both came out ice cold and were a total let down. The mac and cheese was not authentic and the brussel sprouts lacked flavor. We also felt that each of our entrees came with enough food and that nobody really needed the sides. A definite pass from me!  Desserts: These were our favorite part of our meal, however they are the only thing that 204 North doesn't make in house. The desserts come from Suarez Bakery which I definitely need to check out next. We had a sticky bun and carrot cake. They were out of the brownie and didn't have any other chocolate desserts (a bummer!).  So that's a wrap! Some things were ok, and others were major disappointments. There is no validated or direct parking for 204 North, but garages are only a block away.",

Tomatoes were ok, a lot going on with them but nothing stood out. Salad was good but if you can't make a wedge salad that's scary. Filet was cooked well to a medium rare but lacked any flavor along with mashed potatoes and broccoli. None of the food was bad, it just wasn't memorable. Would have given another star but the service was awful. Painfully slow for everything. Had to wait 10+ minutes just to get a knife for the steak, and good luck if you want more water or to order a second drink.",

    "text": "My wife and I were looking for a nice place last week to celebrate our first wedding anniversary without breaking the bank and stumbled upon 204 North! I would classify 204 North as casual fine dining. Upscale and fantastic food offerings without having to get extremely dressed up.  I cannot say enough good things about 204 North. Their cocktail list had the \"usual\" offerings and several drinks with a local twist. I had the \"Southern Sipper\", which consists of bourbon, Cheerwine, and brandied cherries. Definitely a great idea.  Best discovery of the night was that they have a Sunday Supper Club! Three courses for $35, can't afford not to. I had the Caesar Salad, 6-oz. filet, and we split the two dessert options. The caesar salad was HUGE! I probably could have eaten that as a meal in itself. The filet was amazing. Tender, juicy, cooked to perfection. The filet is served with mashed potatoes and vegetables. I had some of the mashed potatoes, but did not get in to the vegetables too much as I wanted to save room for dessert! The desserts were a salted caramel brownie with a scoop of ice cream and rice pudding. The brownie was fantastic - thick and rich, obviously paired very well with the ice cream. I was not a huge fan of the rice pudding, but it was not awful, just a weird contrast with the brownie I guess.   Our server Leon was phenomenal. If there was Yelp! for servers, he would get five stars as well. He said he was new to Charlotte and 204 North, but he had all the answers to our questions - very kind and very professional. When we return to 204 North, I would definitely ask if he's working and if we could be in his section!",

    "text": "My boodle and I went to 204 North last night to celebrate our very first wedding anniversary, and I could not imagine going anywhere else to celebrate. Last night was our first time at 204 North.  Cocktails - YUM! I ordered the \"Call Me Maybe,\" a tequila, berry, jalapeno beverage. It was delicious, with a kick, and pretty unique. Would definitely order again.  Food - I ordered off the Supper Club menu, which includes a salad, entree, and dessert for $35. This is a really great deal, and every part of it was delicious. The wedge salad comes with chunky blue cheese dressing. I ordered the 6 oz fliet. It was cooked to perfection and full of flavor. It came with mashed potatoes that were fresh and smeared across the plate.  The presentation was phenomenal. There were also carrots and root veggies that came with that, both seasoned well and tasty. For dessert, I did the rice pudding. This is a little different that I was expecting. It was a creamy, rice-y consistency that was sweet with a hint of lemon. The flavor was amazing.   Parking - It's Uptown Charlotte, so you can make your own assumptions about parking...  Service - Leon was our server and he was great! If I go back, I hope to see Leon again. He was incredibly attentive without being overbearing, and he was enjoyable to chat with. Thanks Leon for being awesome!  Atmosphere - 204 North is well decorated. It's trendy, but it can be a \"dress up\" and a \"dress down\" place at the same time. Their menu offerings definitely suggest it's fancier, but the atmosphere suggests it can be casual. Love that about this place.",

    "text": "In the epic words of King Arthur in Monty Python -\"you make me sad\". This was probably the most lackluster brunch I've had in years, as in, we didn't even finish eating. I'm not saying any of this to be cruel, mean, or spiteful at all, but aim to be as honest and as helpful as possible. This was legitimately terrible. 204 North Kitchen and Cocktails does indeed have a lovely hipster vibe/decor going on that is accompanied by frequent heavy country music, which is very odd. My sister and I walked in to find only around 6 customers present, which is worrying on a Saturday at brunch time. But we always try to give restaurants a fair shot.   We really wanted to try this place as it had pretty good reviews(although it stumps me as to why). The service was polite and quick but when the food came out, it started sliding downhill very quick. I ordered the Summertime Pancakes which comes with peach preserves, blackberries, toasted meringue. As for the side, I ordered scrambled eggs. What I received instead was probably the most disappointing flapjacks in all of pancakedom. Those things were so dense, due to over mixture of the batter, they could've probably been used as body armor.  They were in such desperate need of leavening, vanilla, maybe some cinnamon and nutmeg that they probably could've pleased the most persnickety of bland food eaters. In addition, I never received any preserve fruit topping(it was only after I pointed this out that the waitress brought me fresh strawberries and blueberries, which is nice and all but isn't what it's supposed to actually come with it), and as you can see in the picture, the tiniest topping of meringue ever. May I also point out that scrambled eggs are NOT supposed to be brown! They were completely inedible. Moving on to my sister's Avocado Skillet. Anything that has the word \"Skillet\" in it usually comes out hot and bubbly yes? It was COLD, the asparagus was chopped far too fine, and the sauce could have used some seasoning and cooking as it tasted exactly like canned tomato sauce. Which is fine, but my god people! At least try to put some effort into it.  Note: This is not a rant by any means, but it needs to be said because this place is in desperate need of gastronomical help.   Let's recap shall we? It takes some actual effort to screw up something as simple as pancakes, scrambled eggs, and delivering something that is supposed to be extremely hot.   Do you hate your own cuisine? Because the lack of care, respect, and love when I tasted your food was tangible and stood out like a sore thumb. This, ladies and gentlemen, is why most restaurants go under. You may have the best location, the best decor, the best service, and STILL fail all because you neglect to transfer any of the positive emotions mentioned above to your food.",

We started with the meatballs on a bed of rosemary polenta which was out of sight!! Because we were not terribly hungry and getting ready to head across the street to see Hamilton,  we ordered light... soup of the day, the wedge salad and parmesan fries, along with a beautiful 2015 red blend from Klinker Brick.

Our dinner limited us to some beer and wines so I would be curious about the cocktails. But seeing as how I will probably never be to Charlotte again in my life I'll just have to wonder for the rest of all time. They do have a great local selections as it seems that Charlotte is the craft brewery capital of the world or something by the amount of breweries opening here. The desert was awesome. I had pumpkin cheesecake, my fiance hates pumpkin and loved it. Also as a side note the upstairs bar looked like the place to hang and meet people if you in your mid to late twenties and wearing business casual.",

I would definitely recommend this for other events or a regular night out!",

    "text": "I've only been once, but it was a really good experience.  I got the salmon with beets and mashed potatoes and loved it! I'm a big fan of beets but I'm really particular in how they are cooked. These were roasted and I think they had a sweet glaze to them; the consistency was just right. The mashed potatoes were great, but what isn't great if you had truffle oil to it? The salmon was good, too, but the sides really made the dish for me.   My husband ordered the flat iron steak. It comes with a side of carrots and turnips, which he said he would've preferred to have been cooked a little longer. I liked them, though. They weren't raw by any means but definitely had a crunch to them.   We shared an order of devil egg appetizers. If you try nothing else at this place, try those. They are topped with fried oysters which gives them such a nice flavor and texture. In our case, our server forgot to put the order in, so they comp'ed them for us. He was upfront about it and I almost told him to just cancel, since we got our entrees first. He convinced us to try them anyway and I'm so glad he did.  The service and vibe are nice. Everyone was very friendly. And aside from the mishap with the delayed appetizer, which worked out in our favor in the end and was clearly an honest mistake, it was fast. I like the design and layout of the place. It did a good job of feeling upscale-casual -- not snobby at all but feels nice enough for a date night, girls' night out, or even a work lunch.  I hope to go back soon to see if the service and food are consistent. I've seen a few negative reviews but so many factors can contribute to a one-time bad experience; I'm hoping those bad experiences are the exception and not the rule. I'd love to have a new 'go-to' restaurant uptown for when we catch a show at Belk Theater (that's why we were there) and so far this seems like a good fit.",

    "text": "I made the mistake of coming to the restaurant during RESTAURANT WEEK. I can understand the staff possibly being tired, and having had a long day. But some of the things I experienced during dining here was unacceptable. I made the reservation for 8:45pm (because thats the most reasonable time they had available). We started our meal with calamari and spicy garlic shrimp. The shrimp were great, but the calamari was poorly prepared and extra chewy. Almost like they had been refried.... it was super greasy... I wouldn't have served it. When it was time to order dinner I chose the 3 course RW option.. starting with a Caesar salad, which was wilted when it arrived. I attempted to order the Flat Iron steak option... they were out of it (like many of the other things I tried to order) but the server informed me that they would be preparing filets in place of the Flat Iron steak.. with the same set up. I ordered that. I attempted to order a glass of red wine with my meal, and they were out of the first 2 things I attempted to order. I had to settle for a Zinfandel. My steak (which was cooked okay) came out with none of the things listed on the descriptor! I got a plain filet with cold mashed potatoes and cold broccoli! No chimichurri in sight. This was supposed to be my friends birthday dinner... so I had plans of ordering dessert in ADDITION to the Turtle Cheesecake I was supposed to be getting (per my 3 course option). I pulled our server to the side asking about birthday options. He assured me he would do something nice (and told me it would be free). He brought 4 mini desserts to the table. A bowl of MELTED ice cream (As in.. completely melted.. not just a little melted), a brownie with semi-melted ice cream on top, a hard sticky bun, and a decent carrot cake. WHO BRINGS COMPLETELY MELTED ICE CREAM TO A TABLE?! Not to mention he only brought 2 forks... there was 4 of us at the table. He told us he would be right back with 2 extra forks (which he didn't bring until he brought the damn bill) Notice the 4 desserts I listed? Yeah... no cheesecake. When I inquired about the cheesecake I was supposed to be receiving... he said \"oh ma'am sorry I forgot to tell you we were out of the cheesecake!) WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT MY DESSERT I WAS SUPPOSED TO GET ONLY TO BE TOLD YOU'RE OUT OF IT. YOU WEREN'T EVEN GOING TO SAY ANYTHING UNTIL I ASKED. Not to mention he charged me for my dessert! The lapses in service are  inexcusable.  We won't be back.",

We were put at a table in the window by the door. It could have gotten cold with people coming in and out, but they made sure to have a portable heater ready to go when we got there.

The kicker was that we had to ask the manager if we could place an order. Our waitress just didn't seem to have any sort of grasp on timing. We also had to ask for our check at the end of the meal...after our table had been cleared and drinks finished. She came by and \"checked on us\" but seemed totally caught off guard when we requested the bill, like it never even occurred to her that we'd be ready to go.  Lastly was this weird light thing. Periodically thru the meal, there was this random strobe light above us that would flash. Thankfully no one had a seizure.  Will go back for drinks, but that's it.",

    "text": "Well, that was disappointing   I've been watching as 204 was built and finally got in business. It's a beautiful space with warm wood and industrial accents, but what it looks like doesn't pay to keep the lights on. My wife and I got there today just at opening. We were first if the day. That should be good, right? Fast service, fresh food, etc. But none of that happened. The service was ludicrously slow, taking a very long time to actually be greeted by our waiter. Drink orders in and we waited another very long time to get them. Our waiter told slush that the unsweetened tea had not been made yet but he got it started. We ordered lunch. She, a chicken Cesar salad. Myself, the trio of tacos with a side kale salad with white balsamic vinegarette. Another long time later we got our food. The Caesar salad was \"okay\" but the chicken is sick very small and the flavor was generally absent. The tacos were a mess. Though a pretty mess. I am under the impression (I am a food service professional so my impressions are from a place of knowledge) that I got last night's meats. After such an extended period of time between ordering and service, I would have expected the meats to be very hot, they were at best tepid. The steak was tepid and kinda tough, the chicken was tepid and the same as the meat on the salad, and the pork belly (which I was SO looking forward to) was tepid and somewhat dry. No delightful fat pockets that pork belly is known for. No super smoky flavor. Just there. As we almost finished lunch we got our unsweetened tea. Told by our waiter that he had spilled the tea he had made and this batch was just now done. Thankfully they did charge us for tea or I would have had a fit. Finally, the white balsamic vinegarette had no flavor at all! I scooped out what I could of my wife's extra Caesar dressing to help.  And, considering the waiter seemed to be the only service guy until the bartender finally hopped out to help.on the floor, our change took a ridiculous time to get back. This was a not-good-at-all trip. Sad.",

We ordered the meatloaf and pimento cheese ravioli for entrees, but they were out of both.  I will give them a pass...hopefully it's because both are really good.  Our backups were the seared Steak and Lobster Mac n Cheese.  Both were good, but didn't blow us away.  The Mac N Cheese comes with a delicious corn side..my only complaint is that there wasn't more of it.      The desert was by far the best part!  Their warm sticky bun with butterscotch ice cream is worth the trip itself!",

    "text": "What a great addition to uptown Charlotte.  Popped in here for a quick mid-day bite to eat and to finally check this place out.  We were greeted by all smiles and sat at the bar for easy access and instant service.  I tried the deviled eggs (with a twist because of a mini fried oyster atop it) and the smoke chicken wings.  Both really well done and both hit the spot to tame my hunger.  In addition they had a bloody mary bar and a great selection of cocktails alongside draft and bottle beer selections to surely satisfy.  The interior is warm and cozy and trending along with other new locations by way of the use of tufted leather seating, wood and steel elements.",

    "text": "Gah. Shame on me. Came here once before and got a few drinks, pork belly appetizer, and dessert. The drinks were overpriced, appetizer wasn't very good and was a tiny portion, and dessert wasn't memorable. The only thing memorable was a gigantic cockroach crawling up the wall next to us. The server ended up taking care of our bill so we left a nice tip and thought we'll try it again after it's been up and running awhile. Came here for Queens Feast on a Tuesday night. They still have a condensation problem on the pipes because I kept getting dripped on the entire night. The service was super slow. We were there for 2 hours and 45 minutes... I got the fried green tomatoes which were surprisingly good. Also got the salmon which was under salted but the other 2 people that got the salmon thought it was over salted so maybe they salted theirs instead of mine? Ordered the sticky buns but by the time they brought out dessert they had run out so I got the peach shortcake which was really dry and didn't have enough cream to compensate. Also they had balsamic dots to plate which I thought was chocolate. The balsamic decor did not go well at all with the shortcake. Overall food and service was underwhelming.",

I looked around and I felt like this place is upscale. You don't bring out burnt bricks. On to the food, I ordered the NC organic chicken served with a teaspoon size of potato puree, extremely hard turnip roots, a carrot slither, and two mustard jus. The veggies were so hard that I couldnt eat them. The chicken was seasoned to perfection and moist. The veggies could have been great if I could chew them. Hard as rocks! I paid $22 plus tax for chicken and the teaspoon of potato puree. My friend ordered a burger that came with fries. I took the fries too eat with my meal. The water wasn't filtered and tasted like dirt smells. I rarely EVER write a two or one star review. Overall, the restaurant can be great or even fabulous by making corrections on the above problems. The inside is very pretty and right now I feel is it only good for getting drinks.",

It was quite lively and I grabbed the last seat at the bar. The cocktail menu was quite impressive. Cocktails (aka libations according to the cool kids) were named after the various neighborhoods and suburbs in the Charlotte area. I had the Dilworth...quite refreshing gin drink. Then I ordered a small portion of the kale salad and smoked pork belly.   While I was waiting for my food, the server, Molly, brought me some fresh made bread with this amazing fruit butter. Not that I needed all those carbs but I finished it all. The pork belly arrived; it was so delicious and I consumed it quickly. The kale salad was too salty and I could not eat more than two bites. I told Molly that I was not able to eat it. She was so gracious and took it off my check which I really appreciated it.   Would love to come back on my next visit to uptown and try some more cocktails and food here!",

Tori was fantastic, responsive and answered most emails within a day.  She helped with menu suggestions, seating arrangements, and accepting flowers from the vendor.  She helped design and print personalized drink menus with creative drink names.  Stafford assisted with the day of the event, moving tables, getting candles for tables and coordinating staff.  There were plenty of bar tenders and wait staff to keep the buffet dishes filled, the drinks flowing and the dishes cleared. The atmosphere was casual but classy, and encouraged guests to mingle.  They even personalized the chalk boards for our event! Our guests loved the food, especially the meatloaf, shrimp and grits, Nashville chicken and brussel sprouts. I can't praise this venue and this staff enough.  I highly recommend it for your next event.",

The interior is beautifully decorated and I could tell how much thought went into the design. The owner even put ample purse hooks throughout the bar and on some of the tables - awesome!  Every cocktail I tried was delicious. I had the bartender make me a drink based on my preferences and I would definitely order it again if it was on the menu. The Ballantyne was another personal favorite of mine and is sure to be a big seller.  Again, it was obvious that 204 dedicated a lot of time to the small touches that make an experience great. Right off the bat, we were given housemade ciabatta with a spicy olive oil dipping sauce. Sooo good. My favorite appetizer was the fried green tomatoes and housemade pimento cheese. The pimento really added to the dish and I love that they made it in house. All of of the entrees I sampled were delicious but I was really impressed by the chicken. It's so easy to mess chicken up but this dish was incredibly moist and flavorful. For dessert I tried the sticky bun. I was told that the restaurant has a pastry chef from Scotland so I look forward to trying more of his creations! 204 is a much needed addition to the area and I look forward to going back.",

I'm not sure if it was the time of day or or it's just how the restaurant runs on the regular, however I was VERY pleased with the service my mother and I received yesterday (2.17.18) when we went to this spot. We arrived around 2 p.m. The restaurant wasn't super busy however they did have a large party and a few other tables to serve. Initially when we walked in I was a little irritable because NO ONE acknowledged us, not even the servers or bartenders as we waited at the hostess stand. However, after a minute or two the hostess finally arrived back at the stand and took us to our table. Everything after that was perfect. Our server Mike was outstanding. He had the best smile and he kept checking on us (but not in an annoying way). Appetizers and food came out speedy, fresh and hot! Our drinks were outstanding! They were so fresh and had plenty of alcohol. I think prices are super reasonable and the atmosphere is so cute and cozy. Between my mom and I the bill was 106 and I left a 20% tip. We had 5 cocktails between us, two appetizers and two entrees. I will DEFINITELY be back. My only recommendation to this restaurant would be to make sure guests are greeted upon arrival.",

We were sat right away and ordered drinks which did not come until 15 min later (water took 30 min!!! IT'S WATER!!!!). We then had to wait almost an hour to order our food because our waiter did not come over to our table at all but went to every other table around us. When we finally ordered it took us 1 1/2 hours to get our food which then came out cold. Not luke warm...COLD. We had to send a few things back and didn't even bother with the rest because the wait staff was obviously annoyed with us. The Mac and cheese may look good on photos but beware. They make a large amount of it and it just sits under a heater all day so it is dry, crunchy, and not good at all. To be honest the food and service were less than mediocre and I will not be coming back. STAY AWAY!!",

Negatives: ambiance is a hot mess --- loud pop music overhead, faint odor of stale beer, uncomfortable metal chairs, cloth napkins but one fork & knife for entire meal; server pleasant but young & inexperienced; no menu specials. 204 North hasn't made up its mind whether its a bar with pretty good food or a restaurant with a trendy bar scene. Like the cocktail vibe, but that suggests a more sophisticated crowd that demands a classier dining experience than they currently deliver. It's almost as if the GM and the chef are not on the same page about what pays the bills. If they want to be great (one way or the other), someone needs to take the lead.",

Also available for the Elites was a nice array of cheese, crackers & Lavish spreads; On other tables was a grilled cauliflower & chick peas dish, delicious deviled eggs and a few other dishes to delight our pallets!

From the moment we walked in we were not so politely greeted by the hostess who told us it would be a 30 minute wait but it ended up being no wait, which was great.  We were seated and told she would be right back with our menus.  It was at least 5-7 minutes later we had no water, had not been greeted and had no menu.  Finally the hostess brings us 3 menus even though we had a party of 4.  It was just all downhill from there...put it this way..we got our appetizer before our drinks.   The breakdown was like this: -we asked for water with lemons to start.  We had to ask for the lemons two more times before we got them -the meatballs we ordered were served cold and not on purpose -the duck fat potatoes were bland as could be -we were never given appetizer plates -we were served rose when ordered prosecco -when we inquired about our drinks by one of the guys running our food he said \"I will get your server\"...not a very lofty idea considering she is the one that was missing the mark -we were told the smores in a jar was great for sharing with 4 people yet it came with 4 small fractions of a Graham cracker and really was best suited for one person.  I could go on and on.  It was just a disheveled, unorganized hot mess of an operation.  I did enjoy the flavor of the meatballs and the tempura shrimp was good!  The Brussels salad sounded good but it was dry and had no flavor.  It was also very small.  I was just overall not impressed at all.  I think the atmosphere was lovely and the location is ideal!  They just have a lot of work to do to make it worth the price point and trouble of dining uptown.  I wouldn't return at this point.",

Me and my boyfriend were having a date night and I was looking forward to going here all week. I had seen Charlotte Agenda post their Nashville Hot Chicken and knew I had to have it. When I got my food I was appalled. The chicken was so over fried! I was surprised the cook looked at that and thought it was acceptable to send out to a guest. It was like a hard shell around the chicken and was so overfried the top wasn't even touching the chicken inside. I couldn't even bite into it, I had to peel off the shell just to taste some of the chicken inside. The Mac and cheese that came with it looked and tasted like it was 3 days old that had been reheated 12 times. The best part of the meal were the pickles that came on top of the chicken.  Why didn't I send the food back you ask? Hmm... probably because our server was so MIA the whole time she never came up to us on her own. It took flagging down from my boyfriend to get her to come to us for water refills or a drink order. I didn't want to take 20 minutes to find her then another 20 for the food to be recooked. We just wanted to leave as soon as possible. She didn't even clear our table once so we had empty glasses and the empty appetizer on the table with our food and new drinks, half of it was close to falling off if we weren't super careful. When we finally flagged her down again to get the check she got it back to us then stood and stared as us...it was so awkward. So my boy friend was like ohh and handed her the card. (Most servers walk away and give you a second to pull it out). When she brought the card back a couple minutes later she kept looking at us and rudely said you got your card back right? Trying to rush us to leave while I was trying to finish my drink. Anyways we left and had to finish getting cocktails and dessert at another restaurant because of the awful experience there.  My friend and her family were also at the restaurant the same night and she also complained to me after how bad their service was as well.   Pictures I'm attaching don't even do it justice how bad the food looked.",

For Sunday brunch, I had the hot chicken and grits.  The chicken was breaded and seemed fried and was served on top of a thick piece of bread with pickles on top.   The grits seemed like they had some cheese in them.   It was a fun meal and different from the norm.  We were seated at a high top table and had to sit on stools without backs.  My only complaint was that the stools were uncomfortable.  But, this place has a huge glitzy bar and we assume that much of their business comes from people popping in for drinks.  They probably use the bar stools just long enough to swallow a drink or two.  There were some regular tables in front of the restaurant.   Next time, I will ask to be seated there.  All in all, it was another uptown urban dining experience with a warehouse feel.  I am a definite fan!",

We came for Easter brunch after church (as I imagine many people did) so we made sure to make a reservation just in case. We were promptly seated, ordered drinks, and ordered food all in about 10-15 minutes. Our server was very nice and helpful. We got \"bubbles for the table\" to drink, which in hindsight was a great choice because it was the only thing that kept us happy through the whole restaurant experience. For about the next 20 minutes, we waited on my friend's appetizer. She ordered deviled eggs with oysters on them. It wasn't necessarily bad, but there wasn't much flavor unfortunately. I was hoping that the restaurant would redeem itself once our brunch plates came out, but after a while we started seeing other people get their food around us. A little over an HOUR after we placed our orders, our food finally came out and it was warm, at best. My friend ordered the shrimp and grits, which was the most under-seasoned thing I've ever had, and I got the home fry skillet which would've been great if it was actually any temperature over mildly warm. If it's served in a skillet it should be hot. Not only did we wait an hour, it tasted like we got the leftovers.  The manager walked over to the table next to us and discounted their meal due to wait times (I'd say they waited about 20 minutes less than we did) and then came over and did the same for us - even though none of us asked. It was barely a discount for having spent two hours there for just two people to eat, but it was a nice gesture. The only reason this isn't a one star review is because the staff was so nice the entire time.   After spending more than two hours of our holiday there, we came home to change and try to enjoy what was left of our day even though my friend said she felt sick shortly after we left the restaurant. She has been throwing up for pretty much the entire afternoon, so safe to say our experience pretty much ruined our entire holiday plans. We unfortunately will not be returning.",

I opted for their cheeseburger and it did not disappoint. It was cooked perfect and juicy with yummy parmesan fries to compliment. I have yet to try dinner but I look forward to it!",

It has spiced rum, strawberry, mango, peach, lime and black tea. I expected for it to be a little bit sweeter ( our waitress suggested it was one of the sweet options) but it wasn't. It had a nice flavor but I'd look forward to trying something else the next time.   Next, I tried the calamari. It was good, I really liked that it came with peppers! It's a nice start to the meal.  For dinner, I ordered the salmon. It comes with beets but you can sub for any of the other veggies. I opted for the roasted brussel sprouts. The salmon was cooked perfectly and delicious! The mashed potatoes with truffle oil were delicious too! The brussel sprouts were a bit of a disappointment. They were a bit too crispy and dry for me. I love them roasted but these didn't do it for me. I'd absolutely order this dish again, just select another side.   But overall, the service was good and the they have a great menu. I'm also looking forward to giving the brunch a try!",

I am petite so sitting on a bar stool for dinner does not work well for me, my feet dangle, (DON'T LAUGH) and I need a place for my purse. I asked to be moved to an actual table with regular chairs and the server was hesitant at first. There were several open tables  not sure if they had reservations to come in but she eventually moved us. For the app, we ordered the calamari. It had fried peppers in it too. be careful if you don't like spicy. Also the marinara to me tasted like tomato paste not marinara, I didn't use it.  For my main meal i ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes and regular corn. When I tell you this was so good. I wish it didn't end. I would order this again. I will say I wish they validated the parking. Parking in the garage is a a little weird to get to the restaurant when you park. It was impossible to get street parking. Other than that, no complaints. Give it a try!",

For appetizers we got the deviled eggs and calamari- both were not too bad.  The dinner however was just very bland and disappointing especially for the price! My mom and I both got the Nashville hot chicken and side of potato salad. The chicken needed a sauce or something to make it a little more interesting or flavorful, but I will say that the potato salad was good. The other people in our group got burgers and a salad and I don't think anybody was particularly impressed with their meal.   Just based on reading the descriptions on the menu the food sounds really good, which is why I I picked this restaurant, but 204 North failed to deliver. I may give this place a second chance in the future, but I don't know if I want to take a chance and spend that kind of money here again for another so-so meal.   Come for the cocktails and apps, but don't stay for the dinner.",

All was delicious, but to me the star of the dinner was the hot chicken sliders.....they have a hot chicken dinner, but the beauty of the chicken on a bun with a pickle is what you really want.  One order of the chicken appetizer comes with 4 sliders.  Next time we'd definitely order more than one order and I'd probably consider making this my me with another app or salad or something.

    "text": "If all you want is a place that looks great, then 204 North fits the bill to a T. In fact, they go a bit farther by having a nice sounding menu as well - several, in fact you might even say many of the items on the menu are ones that you would like to order, and therein lies the problem.  We stopped by prior to a show at the Belk, so we were there for brunch. That may or may not change your results, but keep that in mind.  One of our orders was for a BEC (Bacon Egg and Cheese) on a bagel. One of the keys of this item is that it is offered on a plain or an everything bagel. I enjoy an everything bagel, and in fact do not particularly care for plain, because they are, well, plain, so I opted for the everything. I also found that the sides offered, at least at brunch, are not terribly exciting (sorry, I don't want a side bagel with my bagel), so I went with the fruit.  What was the fruit? According to the server, it was \"seasonal\". I have never seen a seasonal plant, tree or vine, but I decided I would give it a go.  When the order arrived, it was served... on a plain bagel. Now I have worked in a food service. Mistakes happen. Ingredients run out. Busy periods happen. Yet we were some of the first people there on the first day of brunch. And regardless of all of that, it's somewhat irrelevant, because the server neglected to mention that there was no everything bagel on the plate.  Now I could see that there wasn't one, but you would think that they would mention this, apologize for not having it, or something. Anything. Nope, just plopping it down. So I asked about it, only to be informed that they didn't have them anymore. The way it was phrased made it sound like the everything bagel was no longer an option, and I get that the server may not be a party to this, and it is definitely not their fault.  But still - most restaurants have a lovely list that tells servers what they should tell people is off the menu (temporarily or permanently). I don't know whose fault it is, but it's annoying. Even more so because it's not the only item - apparently they were also out of chicken salad. I probably wouldn't have ordered it, so it is nice that the server found out. I ended up getting a less-than-exciting biscuit and splitting the somewhat better chicken and waffle dish we already had, because we had somewhere to be.",

The waiter came and hung up my coat (we passed it near the front) and I pulled out my handy purse hanger to hang it from the table.  We were in a hurry and quickly ordered.  I had a glass of the Stonecap cabernet and the Spicy Garlic Shrimp.  The spice level was above medium and delightful without burning my lips.  We also shared the Salted Caramel Brownie served with vanilla ice cream.  It was delicious.  Overall, this was a quick, convenience, and tasty option before a show.

    "text": "What was hailed by the bartender as an awesome charcuterie board under-delivered in just about every way.  From the overall placement of the ingredients, to the tiny globs of meat, our tray suffered right out the gate.  First, our \"board\" was an aluminum tray with food placed directly on it (no liner).  My wife quipped \"looks like something they'd slide through a prison door.\"  I could ramble on about the two mediocre cheese options, the scarcity of meat, the cheap crackers, the sprig of grapes with some way beyond ripe, the dab of pimento, a couple nuts, etc.    The bartender asked what we thought and was obviously flustered when we said,  \"Meh, not so good.\"  He tried to make it up in small ways when billing us out,  which we appreciated, though unnecessary.   His kitchen let him down, and unfortunately, us,  too.  Shop around.",

We were a party of 8 and  I showed up a few minutes later than some of my party and was never asked if I wanted a drink so I just drank water.  It took 1.5 hours from the time we ordered our entrees to get them and when they came out 5 came out together, 1 came out a few minutes later, and the last 2 came out 20 minutes after the 1st 5.  I'm not sure if they have dessert or not because our waitress never offered it to us, she just brought us our check.  Dinner was 2.5 hours long and most of it was spent waiting for our entrees.  I will not return based on the service.",

When we arrived we were welcomed and sat right at the bar. Charles was our bartender and he took good care of us. He helped us pick from among their selection of drinks and even had a few of his own concoctions.   He was very personable and knowledgeable. The bar has its own kitchen. I had a burger and we shared some pork belly. They have bar and high top seating.  The cocktails were delicious and are among the best in Charlotte. We will definitely return and sample more of their creative cocktails.",

The first time was a week ago for lunch and although it was underwhelming (tacos fell apart, friend's salad had chicken on it that looked like it was chopped after being pulled out of a can, etc.), I gave them another chance.  I won't be returning.  Where to begin. The drinks were watered down on top of being overpriced. There were 20+ minute gaps where we'd order a new drink and wouldn't get anything back, sometimes not even a refill on the water either. The food was abysmal. We ordered the charcuterie and cheese plate, calamari, fried oysters, and sticky bun. Strangely, the sticky bun came out 5 minutes before everything else, and was so hard and cold that I could have thrown it through their window. When the other food items arrived, we didn't even have silverware or plates and had to ask for them when they rushed away without checking. Bizarre.   I have literally never asked for the manager in a restaurant, but had to when we got the check that included all of the food (over half of which was sent back). They came out and gave us the typical sob story about being understaffed that night and sometimes you just have a bad day, blah blah blah, but after reading other reviews of this place I think it must be pretty commonplace.   TL;DR version - do not go to 204 North.",

Several tables open and we were told since we didn't have a reservation we had to sit at the bar, which we did. Clearly bartender wasn't happy about serving us as my daughter and I had to use napkins to wipe our areas down (there were 3 other people at bar so she wasn't busy). My $4 cup of coffee was never refilled. My daughters sandwich was to come with out mayo which upon seeing it slathered on the sandwich when delivered we asked the waitress to return to get it corrected somewhere....we never saw her again or the bartender to even check on us until they delivered the check. We saw other people come in to eat and were turned away if they didn't have a reservation...meanwhile by the time we left 3/4 of restaurant was empty. Clearly understaffed..and staffed with people who didn't want to work.  Very disappointed in this establishment and will be letting anyone who asks me know.",

    "text": "We live in Uptown, so we were anxious to try 204. Fortunately our initial impression did not follow through the evening. When we arrived, the hostess did not look up from her iPad. She stood sideways to us, no greeting, no eye contact, nothing. It wasn't until I looked at my husband and said,\"invisible syndrome\", did she even acknowledge that we were there. We told her we had reservations and she picked up 2 menus and walked away. We looked at each other, like, \"are we supposed to follow her?\" She turned around and looked at us, as if we should be mind readers. At that point I imagined the worst. Fortunately, it got much better.   The decor is very nice with beautiful wood floors, brick walls, and an industrial feel. The music is at a good level so you can communicate without yelling. Our server, Mikaela, was pleasant, attentive, and helpful. We enjoy good food, and I have always been an adventurous cook, so we are pretty happy eating a good meal at home on the balcony enjoying the skyline. If we eat out, we expect it to taste good and be memorable, or what's the point?  I ordered the Mahi Mahi, and it was very good. The asparagus, rice, and fish were cooked perfectly, and were not over salted (one of my pet peeves). My husband had the meatloaf, and enjoyed it too and said the green beans and mashed potatoes were cooked and seasoned perfectly. We are not big dessert people, but ordered the key lime pie, which was not on the online menu yet... also very good and worth the calorie splurge.   If I had gone by the unwelcoming attitude of the hostess, I would have just walked out and we would have missed a very nice meal. My husband, the nicest guy ever, said, \"she is sucky as a hostess.\" Sadly, if someone doesn't explain to this young woman how to be hospitable, there will be people who won't take the time to find out the potential this place has. I hope they do well, because it is always nice to have a reliable go-to spot you enjoy within walking distance.",

She was a total mind reader and gave our group some prime real estate at the front of the restaurant. You know ... the cozy one in the window with perfect lighting and a great view for people watching.  Then we met AJ, our waiter - suave, debonair and very attentive. He helped us go through the menu and made some excellent suggestions for both apps and dinner.  There's a great draught beer list with some of my local faves like Higher Ground (Birdsong) and Juicy Jay (Legion) - but for those you that like wine or cocktails, the list of selections is incredible. I did sneak a taste of a cocktail called the Dilworth that could easily convince me to become a cocktail drinker!  To start: The Nashville Chicken Sliders had just the right amount of heat and were super delicious. Oh and those deviled eggs with the crispy fried oysters on top - just add a little Sriracha and you've got the perfect bite.  Main Course: Our group passed around our plates so we could try some of each dish - Tagliatelle with Shrimp, Apple Brined Pork Chop with Sweet Potato Puree/Succotash and the House Burger, the 204 Cheeseburger.  So glad we did that because it was tough to pick a winner. The Pork Chop was probably my favorite but ooooh that 6 Hour Marinara on the Tagliatelle (and massive amounts of yummy Burrata). But wait, that was a pretty killer burger too - two grass fed patties, caramelized onions, heirloom tomato, house made pickles and the 204 Sauce. Crazy good!! Okay, so maybe it's a three way tie...  So is it time to go to lunch yet? ... 204 North Kitchen me please!!",

Early Friday dinner (cause that's how we roll)... so we had our pick of the tables, luckily we were there early enough to pick out the window table with a ton of natural light (better for food photos ;).  The hostess MJ was super welcoming and seated us promptly and also introduced us to our server AJ... I think it was pure coincidence that the staff were all two-lettered names, but we had a good laugh about it.  AJ was a great server and we picked is brain over the menu.  We decided on deviled eggs and Nashville sliders for our starters and then the pork chop, tagliatelle (w/Shrimp), and the 204 Cheeseburger.  Everything was delicious and very \"insta\" worthy.  Lots of drink options here.  Started with beer, but ended up trying the Dilworth which was pretty refreshing and went with all the food.  Luckily some crazy person I was with brought their own drink umbrella, so our photos got even fancier.  Even though we were super early for dinner, the restaurant eventually filled up - so make sure to make your reservations here if you dine in \"prime time\".  Everything on the menu sounded delicious, so I need to go back and try one of everything.",

I love their bar upstairs and their bartenders make balanced, delicious cocktails.   It seems like burgers are strong on the menu game right now and 204's burger is as my niece says, bangin.   Menu Cut and Paste Time, cue the music.  two grass fed beef patties, american cheese, caramelized onions, bibb lettuce, heirloom tomato, house quick pickles & 204 sauce, served with parmesan fries $16  I just had the burger last night and I could totally eat another one right now! I wonder what time they open?",

It was for any bottle over $40, but he thought there wasn't a minimum spend. This is something I would expect servers to know considering it's an advertised special, which is also displayed on the sidewalk chalkboard outside the restaurant. Additionally, he didn't know about the wines themselves. Having said that, he was extremely attentive to our table which we greatly appreciated.   My friends and I ordered : Appetizers-    - Charcuterie + cheese plate - sopressata and proscuitto tasted a bit 'old' like it  had been pre-sliced for a while. It ate on the dry side. Grapes were super fresh though.   - Calamari- standard; nothing special   - Devilled eggs - has a fried oyster on top! The flavor of the egg itself was a bit underwhelming but it was a unique bite with the oyster   - Beet salad- SUPER refreshing and the perfect amount of goat cheese. I would reorder this!  - Seared scallops- best appetizer by far. They were seared to perfection and full of flavor. Get this!!!   Entrees-  - Tagliatelle with burrata - the burrata looked  beautiful but was not as creamy as I'd like. The tagliatelle was EXTREMELY overcooked- I mean, it was soggy and borderline mushy. The server was very nice and knew something was wrong as we took 2 bites and couldn't eat anymore. They removed the tagliatelle from the bill.   - Burger - nothing special   Long story short, get the beet salad + seared scallops.",

It was cool and unique but I wish the egg itself had a bit more flavor and didn't rely solely on the fried oyster to be the star of the dish. I wasn't impressed.  We also got two drinks- both were tasty I just felt like other bars in downtown Charlotte have better drinks.  The bartender was great though- customized the drinks to our preference and was very personable.",

The GLOWING reviews are really puzzling to me.  The good:  Our server Michael was great. He was friendly, funny, attentive but not overbearing.  The ambiance is super romantic at night so that's a plus.  The Brussel sprouts are delicious. (I'm sure they're even better when they're hot.)  The bad: We ordered the chicken sliders, deviled eggs, Brussel sprouts, and French fries. EVERYTHING came out cold.  The chicken was dry and COLD.  The macaroni and cheese was bland, mushy, and cold.  The French fries were crispy but cold :( The Brussel sprouts had great flavor but came out cold.  Everyone is raving about the deviled eggs here but without the smudge of \"Jam\" on the plate this appetizer is seriously lacking flavor. And what happened to the chives this time??  We didn't order cocktails here because we had just come from somewhere else and honestly I won't be back to try the cocktails. I can't recommend this place to anyone either... maybe this was just a bad night in the kitchen but there are tons of great other places in Charlotte.",

This is definitely my favorite place to eat in Uptown Charlotte. The atmosphere is rustic and relaxed. If you're looking to host a party the upstairs area is very spacious. The staff is very helpful and friendly.  Here are a few menu items I recommend trying:   Food: - Deviled Eggs - Crispy oysters, bacon tomato jam, fresh chives - Fried Green Tomatoes- Green tomato agrodolce, pimento cheese, benton's country ham, basil - Calamari- Fried calamari & sweet peppers with house-made marinara, grilled lemon, herbs & parmesan - Hot Chicken Sliders- Nashville hot chicken on hawaiian sweet rolls with pickles - Charcuterie & Cheese- Classic salami, soppresatta, Ashe county white cheddar, Ashe county marble blue, local honey, Lusty Monk mustard nuts, lavash crackers - Cast Iron Meatballs- 100% grass-fed beef, rosemary polenta, pecorino romano, garden basil  Cocktails: - Amazing Grace - Dilworth - Ballantyne - Hashtag Basic",

    "text": "Considering I give this as a rec basically every week to strangers who message me asking about a great place uptown to \"fill in the blank,\" I guess it's about time I write a review.   Looking for a place to grab dinner? Have drinks? Date night? Girls night? Need a spot to throw an event or special occasion? I find myself always naming 204 North when asked these questions. Why? Well, for starters I don't think I've ever had a bad or lackluster meal or experience here.   Menu-wise, I don't think you can really go wrong here. The meatballs are one of the surprising and sleeper stars on the starters list, they are delicious. I bounce around between a lot of things here- the flat iron is always good (and I'm a sucker for anything with root vegetables), I love the salmon. The Porcini Dusted Mahi is a new fav for me personally. I haven't had brunch here yet, but anywhere that has deviled eggs with crispy oysters and bloody mary sauce on top wins in my book.  They have a great cocktail list. If you are not sure what to order, talk to your server or bartender. They will make sure you get the right thing for you. My favorite is the Call Me Maybe (tequila blanco, blackberry & blueberry puree, muddled jalapenos, lime juice, simple syrup, apero), I love spicy drinks and will always order cocktails made with jalapeno.  The upstairs is beautiful. I've thrown an event here and have also attended several others (engagement parties, showers, etc). Such a versatile space.   The owners and management here are always working so hard and take a lot of pride in what they do. I love seeing how successful 204 North has been for them. Great restaurant/bar, even better people.",

We sat at a table right near the window upon entering, and immediately felt the need for a drink. Our server (who's name I forget, but was knowledgeable and attentive throughout the entire meal) sold me on a Barrel-Aged Negroni. I began frothing at the mouth as soon as those words left his mouth, and I was blown away by the execution. STELLAR.  Appetizers hit the table faster than we could utter the word. Deviled Eggs, Fried Green Tomatoes, and Meatballs. As an Italian, my skeptics were high seeing meatballs and Southern staples sit on the table in unison. However, the meatballs were jam packed with rich flavors. The deviled eggs were topped with a fried oyster, which was as delicious as it sounds. FGT's were my least favorite of the appetizers we shared.   Our server may have overhyped our entrees, especially those of us who ordered the Cast Iron Steak. The steak itself had the most flavor on the plate, and ultimately hit the spot after a long day. The root veggies and potatoes needed some tweaking that all three of us discussed after the meal. Undercooked veggies and overly oily potatoes.   I did enjoy my time here with my colleagues and was rather impressed with the cocktails and appetizers. The restaurant itself seems like it's in a great location, and with a lively environment I would assume they consistently busy. Thanks for my inaugural meal in Charlotte!",

We were immediately greeted by our bartender/server Jim who took our order of a beer, mimosa, Nashville hot chicken sliders and side of macaroni and cheese. It's worth noting that they offered a great selection of draft beers and we both enjoyed our drinks.   Our food arrived after about 15 minutes and it was fresh and hot. The only thing lacking was seasoning. We heavily salted and peppered the mac and cheese and it was pretty good after that. The Nashville hot chicken was crispy and fresh but not really hot in spice. I would say it was somewhere in the ball park of mild-medium heat level. Not bad by any stretch, but not the advertised \"Nashville hot\". We both agreed that if we were to order it again, we'd ask for more sauce to up the heat level.   Service was great. Price was reasonable. We both agree that we'd love to give this place four stars but given the underseasoning, we are going with three. With that being said, we aren't opposed to giving it another shot.",

    "text": "Popped into 204 for drinks and bites before heading to see a movie. You can't miss the entrance from Tryon St. and the restaurant is actually much bigger than you would expect with bars upstairs and downstairs and plenty of seating on both levels. The hostess greeted us quickly and offered a few different seating options. We opted for a high top in the downstairs bar area and found the service to be very fast.   Solid wine and beer list as well as a full bar/ sizable cocktail list. To share, we ordered the crispy Brussel sprouts, Mac and cheese, Calamari and Quinoa Risotto. The calamari was very chewy and probably wouldn't order again (but I did like that it was served with fried peppers as well as a huge marinara dipping sauce). The Mac and cheese and brussels sprouts sides were good but I think pretty over priced for the size of the side. The star of the show was 100% the quinoa Risotto with mushrooms. It was SO good and I would absolutely order again.   The desserts looked really yummy but we didn't have a chance to order as we were running late to our movie. Overall, a solid spot (I need to look into their daily specials) and I plan to come back and try some of their entrees soon!",

    "text": "I came to 204 North one night when looking for a dinner spot near my hotel in Uptown Charlotte. Upon entering on this Thursday night, there were a few people at the bar who were clearly regulars.   The bartender/server, Matt, was awesome in every way. I asked him to give me his take on the lamb v. the hot chicken, and he gave a detailed breakdown of both dishes that led me to choose the lamb with vadouvan sauce. I was not disappointed! The lamb was cooked medium-rare (I normally go medium but this was fine) and served alongside a potato pave, aka sort of a block of potato with cheese and spices. Also very nice.   For libations, I first had the Amazing Grace, a strawberry puree of wonderfulness with rum, peach, lime, and mango. DELICIOUS. It actually tasted like a Jamaican rum punch, but with strawberry puree that you might use in a strawberry daiquiri. I later asked Matt for a recommendation of a gin drink because I'm trying to get into gin, and he said, \"I know just the thing.\" And he did--the Dilworth's combo of elderflower liqueur, lavender butters (which I don't believe I've had used in a cocktail before) and soda water was like springtime in a glass.   I had a side of Mac & cheese that, while not the best in the world, was still solid and had a nice spice.   The vibe of the place late on a Thursday was classy but definitely approachable, and Matt really made the experience great. He even recommended and gave me a tasting of an anejo tequila that I'll be adding to my bar when I get home.   Cheers to 204 North!",

The cocktails are named after areas of Charlotte, so that is fun too.  A very cool atmosphere right in the heart of Uptown that allows you to have great food and service after a show, even during the week.  Places in Uptown all seem to close at 9pm, that has always weirded me out. Every other big city, the places stay open until 2am and life doesn't stop. I am glad we found this place and were able to have a late night meal in style after seeing Heathers, the musical - which was awesome!",

My friend really enjoyed her dirty martinis and my glass of Cabernet was great (and a healthy pour, I might add....definitely got my money's worth.)   The restaurant was FULL of uptown businessmen/women on a Thursday at 7 and it was LOUD near the bar. That, of course, is no fault of the restaurant, but I do no recommend going here for meetings or catching up with friends after work. The patrons were literally yelling (yes, yelling...no exaggeration ) over each other.   I would love to come back at a time when people aren't so obnoxious to try other items on their menu...the food I saw looked delicious!",

I thought the tacos were good not great.  More and more places are doing craft tacos now, especially in and around uptown, and these were not especially creative or tasty.  To be more specific I had the pork belly and steak taco and thought both were somewhat bland in spices while the meats were good quality.  I got the vegetable medley side and thought this was the best and tastiest thing I got.  Overall the service was good and the ambiance was very good for a $10 sit down lunch.  Definitely a great  place for a classier, more formal lunch setting complete with white table cloths.  I will return to try a few more items and update this review.",

They have speciality drinks but thought odd some were on draft and their mule was better hand made versus the way they would typically serve. We got meat and cheeseboard which was lacking quite  bit. Not much on it and nothing special on the cheeses. We got fried green tomatoes and were terrible, the tomatoes were falling apart and soggy and the breading was falling off. I got the Bolognese which was actually great and had homemade pasta, took a chance and was worth it. My husband got the nashville chicken which was really good too, Brussels awesome, Max and cheese super dry and not flavorful. Other two ppl got the short rib which was tiny and over cooked, shrimp and grits were average I was told. I'd come back and try again.",

I don't mind a messy burger when it's a great burger, but this one wasn't worth getting my hands dirty over. RK had chicken and waffles and realized upon receipt of plate it was bone in chicken - and cheap pieces like wings and thighs. Also made for a messy eat not redeemable by the flavor of the waffle.   Bloody Mary tasted like it was poured directly from a mix. Nothing special to season or add to the flavor.   2 stars generous.  Keep searching.  ********  UPDATE:  restaurant management emailed a response within an hour of this original post. Maybe you can look forward to a better burger and better experience while there. A fresh buttered and grilled brioche bun would have upgraded the burger tremendously. Boneless chicken would help the chicken and waffles.",

My friends had one miss with a drink that was an unusual flavor (queen Charlotte punch?) but their new choices (Dilworth something and Ballantyne) were some of the best cocktails I've had.

All drinks are $12 which is a good price and easy to not have to chase down prices. I had the Ballantyne and Myers Park. Both were expertly made.   Staff was super friendly and while it was a soft opening, everyone seemed to be hitting their marks. This place will provide uptown with a \"middle\".

I wish the fries had been cooked a little bit more, but I loved the parmesan on the top for added flavor.  The price is super reasonable for the type of restaurant it is.

    "text": "Just now getting around to this review after a month. Service was slow on Valentines Day and it took forever to get our bottle of wine and order, even though it wasn't very busy. Our drinks finally came out at the same time as dinner...... But that's only the beginning because I ordered the lamb chops and was so excited all day to order them as I had seen a picture of them on social media and they looked great. As you can see in the picture I took, they looked great presentation wise when I ordered them too. Im a huge foodie and love trying new places. I eat out in uptown Charlotte every day. I ate my dinner, seemingly fine, leaving the restaurant to go home and enjoy our short night together. About an hour after leaving the restaurant, I was rushed with sickness and my Valentine's Day night was spent violently vomiting in my bathroom for the next 12 hours straight. I had to call out to work the next day because I had not slept all night long due to throwing up and intense stomach cramping to the point of almost fainting. My boyfriend was so upset that he made the reservation here and that I left with some sort of food borne illness.... this is a new restaurant that I was excited to start going to since it's a block from my work but I don't know if I can go back now.",

The food was an absolute joke. My friend's pork chop was raw in the middle, sided with what looked like canned hop'n johns. My steak was way over cooked and the potatoes had about as much flavor as cardboard. The craft cocktails are the only saving grace for this place, but even those were subpar. Service was real bad. Our server argued with me over what drink I received (I ordered rum and got whiskey). The food took over an hour to arrive for four people. Completely unacceptable considering where you are located and the prices. Step it up guys! Uptown needs more good restaurants. 2 stars is overly generous, but my first experience was good, so I'm chocking it up to an off night?",

In any event, it wasn't awkwardly empty either and we appreciated finding an open table upstairs.  There was a nice selection of cocktails to choose from, but they were a bit pricey at $12 per. I limited myself to two whereas my friends did quite a bit more damage. I ordered the Amazing Grace and the Cotswald. The amazing grace was delicious...the peach puree really stood out. The Cotswald was enjoyable but not as unique. The Ballantyne was a big hit with my friends, whereas the Plaza Midwood was the least popular.",

The seating on the first floor is mostly pub tables and a long row of regular tables on the left side with bench seating against the wall. There is a bar in the back. There is also an upstairs but we didn't see how that was laid out.  The menu consists of things like shrimp and grits, salmon, scallop risotto, a burger, salads and things like that. I ordered the salmon which came with beets and mashed pototoes. I also ordered a caesar salad. The salad came out first. It had tomatoes in it which was a nice change but the dressing was sweet when I prefer it tangy. It would have been nice to have more cheese on the salad as well.  The salmon was good but the portion was small compared to the pound of mashed potatoes. The beets were good but I didn't think the meal went well together.   They do have a good local craft beer selection so I'll give them that but foodwise I was slightly disappointed. I think you can get better southern food at better prices elsewhere in the city.",

Nice selection of liquor and I like that the names of their specialty cocktails were based on Charlotte neighborhoods... no Eastland though.  This little bar is actually quite large with a separate bar/tv area with dining on the 2nd level with some larger tables overlooking the street.  Decent music playing as the bartender has some control over that and was playing some good blues music when we were in.  Tried the taco trio and out of all of them I'd say go with the pork belly taco.  The fish one wasn't crispy at all and the steak and chicken ones were just ok flavor.  I definitely want to go back and try some other stuff though and I'm looking forward to it.  They've only been open about a month or so, but I think it's a nice addition to the area and a nice vibe.",

They have interesting cocktails and good local beers on tap.  My colleagues and I all enjoyed our entrees, and my starter-salad was fresh and great.  Finally, I like the setting.

    "text": "I'm the first to admit that expensive drinks are typically overrated, but I will also say that the cocktail menu at 204 North Kitchen & Cocktails ($12/drink) was absolutely worth the fun Saturday night splurge.   My husband and I stopped here for a couple of post-dinner drinks at around 9:30 pm. The place was definitely buzzing but we were lucky enough to snag a corner seat at the bar. There was a private party going on upstairs but we were happy with the downstairs vibe - some people still eating dinner, but most mingling and drinking as we millennials do. (Not saying it's a bar strictly for millennials - I'll give a shoutout to some Gen Xers that were hanging out, too!!)   We both loved The Wesley Heights cocktail -- seriously delicious. The \"secret sauce\" as dictated by the menu is magical - leaves a slightly sweet, slightly spicy aftertaste. The cocktail menu overall is a fun read with the nods to different areas of CLT.   Around 10:15ish, the vibe changed to more of a club atmosphere (lowered lights, loud music, but great picks...can't complain when Justin Timberlake is played multiple times in the first 30 minutes). People were dancing and having a great time, but it never felt overly-crowded. Overall, will definitely be back to 204 for a fun night out.",

It only started getting busy around 8pm. The atmosphere was beautiful which exposed brick, repurposed wood, and Edison bulbs. Great space!  We started out with drinks and ordered the Ballantyne which was an excellently crafted gin and strawberry cocktail. Very refreshing! For dinner, I ordered the lobster Mac and cheese. It had huge chunks of lobster in it and a great breadcrumb topping, perfectly browned. The cheese itself was a little too \"orange\" for me, but that could just be my personal cheese type preference. It came with a side of roasted veggies which were well seasoned and a nice compliment to the cheesy main dish. We heard the sticky bun was a must-do for dessert, but we were pretty full, so they were kind enough to box it up for us. We haven't had it yet, so I'll update soon!",

We felt rushed to order only to wait over 45 minutes to get our food. I finally had to get up and go downstairs to find someone to complain to because our waiter was no where to be found. The food luckily was good so that's why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. We had an expectation to have a great experience that's why we chose this particular restaurant and they let us and our family down miserably.",

I came in on a Saturday night for dinner and had a reservation. I was seated as soon as I came in. We were sat on floor one near the bar. The waitress was nice! She did an amazing job at checking in on us, timeliness of the food, etc. I had the spicy garlic shrimp for the app it had a nice kick to it. Presentation was nice. For dinner I had the salmon. Loved the beets! The potato's were super thick, but you could tell they were fresh. We ended up skipping dessert because we were so full.  The sticky buns people ordered looked good. My drink, southern slipper (I think) was tasty not too sweet with a good creep up on you liquor.  If you check in on yelp you get 20% off. My only hang up was the chairs. The seating at some of the tables are bar stools. Those stools hurt your buttons don't provide much support for your back! They need to invest in new seats ASAP.",

    "text": "We came here for brunch, with advanced reservations that were clearly unnecessary.  The location was never full-up at any point.  Because we had a reserved table, we were in the front window right next to the entrance.  This is relevant because of three things.  (1) We were completely on display the entire meal.  (2) We were actually seated in front of the hostess podium where we could see the manager glaring at us to leave after we had finished eating, even though the location was 1/4 full and we ordered drinks.  (3) It was so very cold, both from the full glass window but also from the door opening and never fully closing and a general draft in the area.  Suffice to say, this may not be a good choice for people who specifically call in advance to let you know they are coming and want a pleasurable experience--unless you are trying to punish them for good behavior and discourage them from visiting in the future.  When seated, we were given four different menus, but no explanation.  When the server came back and asked to take our orders, I asked her to explain the different menus which did indeed have duplications.  There was a brunch menu with brunch cocktails, a special brunch menu with the same items and similar cocktails, and two drinks menus with--you guessed it, more cocktails (and other drinks, of course).  We ordered two burgers, an omelette, crab cakes Benedict, and avocado toast.  My avocado toast came out almost 30 minutes before anything else arrived.  Seriously.  Awkward.  Also, it wasn't very good.  I liked the bread they used and that there was really a good amount of mashed avocado.  But it didn't taste like avocado.  It tasted like lemon.  Pretty much exclusively like lemon.  And that's despite the egg and red pepper flakes on top.  So I really won't be doing that again.    When the rest of the food came, the Benedict was my least favorite.  The crab cakes were tangy, super tangy, and there was no starch.  No muffin, no side, noting.  Turns out the waitress forgot to let me select a side, bringing out french fries pretty much at the time the eating was done.  So one item way too early, one item way too late.  I think we've got something to work towards here, 204...  The farmer's omelette tasted delicious.  But it got cold very quickly.  More quickly than anything else.  That was sad because I think it was my favorite.  The only thing I would change would be to do it with egg whites only next time.  The burgers were probably the best all-around choice, and the fries that came with the burgers were nice.  The checks were pre-split for us and brought to the table quickly without us requesting them, which wasn't necessary but we weren't going to refuse.  I didn't appreciate the manager coming up to the hostess podium just to glare at us for not leaving immediately when there were clearly other patrons around also sitting and chatting (it _is_ brunch) and also no one was clamoring for our table--or any table for that matter.  Was it really necessary?  No.  Nevertheless, we got the message and went elsewhere for another round of drinks.  They didn't kick us out for sitting and talking and patronizing their location and consumables.    I didn't know about the yelp check-in deal (20% off), but for Uptown Charlotte, the prices were standard, maybe even a bit lighter.  That said, I don't see myself returning when other locations do brunch right and behave like they want my business.",

The food overall is really good and they make great drinks. The first few times I went they were out of everything I wanted but that doesn't seem to be an issue as of lately. They are located in a very great location in uptown and surrounded by a lot of other cool places that makes it an ideal spot to bar hop and grab a drink. The Moscow Mule on tap is really good. The do offer lunch, dinner and brunch on the weekends which makes it a good place to grab a bite before a show at the Blumenthal theater before or after a show. I've had quite a bit on the menu including all of the starters and a few of my favs are  the Deviled Eggs, Rack of Lamb, and Avocado Skillet",

    "text": "Since I heard about the opening of 204 North in Charlotte, it's been on my bucket list to get there for eats and cocktails. They are all about the craft cocktail scene, which is one of my dining loves.   The inside is stunning. It has a 20's, speakeasy feel type to it. There's a beautiful chandelier you can't miss upon walking in and walking upstairs that was custom made in Asheville.  As for the cocktails, I recommend the Ballantyne (Gin, St Germaine, strawberry, mint) and my husband recommends the Banker (bourbon, bitters, sugar, cherry). Our server informed us that they are the most popular orders. Upon trying the Ballantyne, I knew I didn't need to try anything else, I'd be fine with drinking that for the night.   While waiting for your plates to come out, make sure to try the ciabatta bread with seasoned butter. The butter flavors change daily - we got to try a fennel orange butter, which was absolutely delicious. There was just a slight hint of orange - enough to notice, but far from overpowering. I'm hoping the next time I go I can try the strawberry rhubarb flavor!  For appetizers, we started with the fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese and a cabbage chow chow. The chow chow is a delicious vinegar topping with country ham mixed it that gave the tomatoes a bit of a sweeter taste. It was delicious and I could have eaten spoonfuls all by itself!. We also went with the fried oysters, which are soft fried, not greasy fried. They are served with quick pickles that are absolutely amazing, and the housemade buttermilk ranch is not to be missed.   The pork chop was very succulent and flavorful. It comes served over a jambalaya type rice with black eyed peas. We also tried the salmon, which came with a fennel puree and glazed beets. The beets were very tasty, but the salmon had a little too much oil and needed some spices to tone it down. The price point at $22.00 is less than other restaurants though.  We went with our server's dessert recommendation, the sticky bun. The whiskey ice cream that comes with it was amazing, though I would have loved for the sticky bun to be served a little warmer.   Definitely love the atmosphere inside 204 North. It's a great spot for groups or for a romantic, intimate date. They are still very new and will improve with time, but they have a great uptown location and definitely provide a different small plates dining and cocktail experience than other places off Tryon.",

With that being said, their $12 cocktails are worth it.   I was able to check them out during their soft opening, which allowed us to sample quite a few dishes. Below were my favorites:  Cocktail: Ballantyne - but also don't hesitate to tell the bartenders what you like and let them get creative. This isn't one of those bars where they roll their eyes when you say surprise me. They enjoy getting creative and making off menu drinks here.   Salad: Beet salad. Comes with an awesome strawberry vanilla dressing. Nice and light but good flavor.   Appetizers: Fried green tomatoes. These changed my opinion about thinking I did not like tomatoes. Homemade cabbage chow chow and pimento cheese on top.   Entree: Shrimp and grits. Super creamy. Will get the clean plate award any time you order these. If you are looking for something a little lighter I suggest the trout. Not usually a huge fish fan, but it was super moist and flavorful. And not fishy at all.   Dessert: Sticky bun, duh. Even if you order it for the table to split. You must find room in your belly for this at the end of your meal.",

At a couple of points in our visit we were in the middle of speaking to her and she just walked away.  I'm giving this three stars because the wait was very short, the prices are somewhat reasonable, the location is great and the food was okay. We all really enjoyed the fried green tomato appetizer. It was flavorful and had a delicious topping that included pimento cheese. I had the meatloaf and was able to substitute Brussel sprouts as the side instead of green beans. The Brussel sprouts were delicious. The mashed potatoes were pretty good, and the meatloaf was just okay.  The absolute worst part of the meal was the dessert. My friend ordered the sticky bun which was served cold as if it came directly out of a store bought package. I had the salted caramel brownie dessert which was also cold. I asked the waitress why the brownie wasn't warm and she said \"sometimes they serve it warm, and sometimes they don't.\" That made no sense to me. For a dessert that costs 8 bucks, I would expect it to have better quality than a little Debbie's snack cake, but it didn't.  I wouldn't eat here again.",

Service was a little slow, but our waiter was very friendly. Having heard good things about their fried chicken sandwich I had to give it a try.  Fried chicken breast, pimento cheese, quick pickles and onions on a roll.  The chicken was amazing, fried to perfection, crispy and not greasy.  The pimento cheese was a little heavy for me and definitely had a kick to it.  Unfortunately I had one onion on the entire sandwich and the roll was very soggy due to the amount of melted pimento cheese.  A little messy, but overall very good. The fries were good, nothing special. Overall my visit was good and I would be interested in checking out their dinner menu as they offer a variety of other items that aren't offered during lunch.",

The pumpkin cheesecake was great and so was the salted caramel brownie and yes I know I sound like a pig but everything sounded so tasty that I had to try them. Our waiter Paul was amazing as well and a big thanks for his kind service.",

The waitress took it back and a manager brought me back the same piece of meat with the missing section covered with greens to hide it; still not cooked to medium.  This means they took my contaminated piece and placed back on the grill for other people's food to also be cooked on. I called it out and it was not denied.",

    "text": "I really want to like this place, but after giving it a second chance, I do not think I'll be back anytime soon. Pros- the space is great. Food was decent. Not a ton of healthy options, just FYI. Not terrible, but definitely not as good as Stoke or Essex, which are one block away. My largest complaint was unfortunately the service. I was a server for many years, and I completely understand when you're having a bad night, or the bar is backed up, and you're getting blamed for the lack of drinks, etc. However, our server, Regina, was rude from the beginning, barely acknowledging the table with more than a curt greeting. We were not provided any water until we were almost finished with out meal, even though we asked multiple times. And to top it off, when we asked for the bill, we just asked to split it five ways evenly, between the five of us. Easy, right? The systems that restaurants use divide the bill for you. She somehow managed to completely mess it up, coming back to the table and admitting that it wasn't done correctly, and had the audacity to not even apologize or offer to correct it. Turns out, she had only rung up three out of the five cards with the total tab, and out of those three they were not evenly split. I'm not even sure how that happens. As a server, I would never go back to the table with the bill split incorrectly, before finding a manager and fixing it. Mistakes happen. No big deal. But correct it. We spent the next 15 minutes venmo-ing back and forth to get it all straightened out. Not sure what happened there, but a simple apology would have really diffused the situation. Unfortunately we left there with a bad taste in our mouth, and along with the mediocre food, I'm not sure I would recommend this to anyone else. Sad, because I really wanted to enjoy this new spot.",

From the moment I first step foot in this place, I felt like I was at home. The ambiance and atmosphere is fantastic, it really puts you at ease. We worked out way to the bar and Calvin the bartender was very attentive and made several recommendations. He was very thorough in the preparations of our cocktails was fantastic. We sampled a couple of the appetizers and they were just as amazing! Can't wait to sample the dinner menu very soon!!",

Had multiple staff members ask us how everything was going throughout the entire dinner. Our server, Michael, was on point. We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday and they made it very special. Loved the vibe and will definitely return.",

    "text": "This place just does not have good food. The only thing we had that was good was the spinach salad and you can't really mess that up. The oysters were also good but lots of breading...but those are the only 2 things I would order again. Calamari was one of the worst I've ever had, fried green tomatoes weren't good and cheese plate was average. The mahi was recommended as the best on the menu and it was super bland...ravioli was also super bland. Also tried the sticky bun which was good but the bun itself wasn't great the ice cream and caramel drizzle made it. Overall if this place plans on making it they need to do something about the food. It's also not cheap and service isn't great so I would not go back. Hoping it was a bad night for the chef or they get it together because they won't make it in Charlotte with food like that.",

I am now a beets fan as long as it comes from 204. For dessert I had the sticky bun and she had flourless chocolate cake with a splash of sorbet. It was a perfect match. I have been to a number of restaurants in Charlotte and rarely get blown away by the food AND service.  Will be back again and again.",

Because of the AMAZING staff, we ended up canceling our resos at another local establishment and planted ourselves here! The decor is fun, and cozy. Just the kind of place you want to find yourself hanging out and enjoying time with friends without having to scream over bad music....gross. As for the food..........LIFE CHANGING! I mean I'm not one to slap a MAMA but the shrimp and grits where \"slap your MAMA AMAZING!\" WARNING...... come and get them ASAP before I eat all that they have! I have never been one for crazy cocktails but thought what the heck it's girls night ill give it a go so I ordered the Amazing Grace. Not only is the story behind the cocktail so great but the flavors came together perfectly. Moral of the story I had dose. Thanks for the great night 204! Your staff is so much fun! Us ladies will be back next girls Night!",
