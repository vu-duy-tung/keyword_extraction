I ordered, sweet and sour chicken with a side of fried rice, an order of wings, and an egg roll.The least bad of the few was the sweet and sour chicken besides the sauce having a weird flavor it wasn't intolerable but not \"sweet and sour\" like I'm used to. The fried rice was yellow. I absolutely hate yellow fried rice because it's usually made with mexican yellow rice. If I wanted mexican yellow rice I would have asked. It was incredibly dry and taste like mexican rice wow. Next was the chicken wings. Before I even ordered the wings, I called to ask if teriyaki or sesame sauce came on the wings, the lady then informed me that it doesn't but you can request a side sauce of it I then told her that I would request it online and she agreed that would be fine. I ended up with no sauce at all whatsoever, I called and she told me I should have ordered it with her. WHAT? I am completely furious. Not to mention this toxic egg roll they gave me with mystery meat inside of the spoiled cabbage. I swear to you I have never been so disgusted in my life and the reviews on here must be from people with awful senses I'm convinced. Just because I am a college student with a college budget doesn't mean I have poor taste. This place is not it! Honest review. Worst 15.07 I've ever spent.",

    "text": "Because of the location (and receiving a coupon in the mail), I decided to give China Cafe a try. I ordered their Crispy Scallion Chicken while my partner ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp. Mine was good, but the shrimp was terrible. That dish should've been labeled as \"Curry Shrimp\"  since it had such a strong curry flavor to it. A couple weeks after my initial visit I was craving some Chinese food and had another coupon for China Cafe. I ordered the Crispy Scallion Chicken once again and brought it home. When I opened the lid and began to mix the rice with the chicken, I noticed a dark ball (the size of a BB). As I looked closer, it turned out to be a small beetle. I immediately drove back and showed the man at the counter. He quickly stated it was a bean sprout, but a lady who came from the back up to the front said something to him in Chinese, and he informed me that he'd make up another order for me. I told him I'd prefer to just receive a credit back to my card. He didn't seem happy about this but processed it and handed me a receipt. Sadly, the convenient location of China Cafe does not outweigh the fact that there was a sauteed beetle in my rice. *sad face*",

Their spring rolls are tasty too.   Also, be sure to mention that you have a coupon (you can print one offline if you don't have one from their menus).

The sesame chicken was excellent, the egg rolls were crisp and not too greasy, the rice was fluffy, flavorful, and there was a generous portion size.

I ordered a combination of chicken, shrimp and scallops with fried rice and NO MSG.  I also had it steamed.    First, the seafood was good steamed. Large tailed shrimp and sliced thin quarter sized scallops.  Chicken did not have a taste nor tasted like chicken.  More like 50% filler in that chicken(?).  I did not a good experience with the chicken.   The Vegetables were good and tasted like peas, carrots, broccoli, etc.  I had more vegetable than protein.  Oh, the fried rice was very good and the red sauce helped with additional flavoring.   Althought I gave it a 3 star, it could have been the steamed chicken that sayed, eh, OK?!",

I think I would only go here for lunch if I had a choice, and if I felt to eat Chinese. The staff is really friendly and helpful when it comes to ordering, eating in or dining out. There is limited seating as this restaurant is pretty small. If you're in a rush I would suggest to call in and ordering and picking it up. I can't be sure if they delivered, but to my knowledge is that they don't because I've always seen people come and pick food up rather someone running out.   Overall, I would suggest to come eat here if you're looking for a cheap lunch and very filling one. It might be unhealthy, but damn is it good (mostly everything is like that.)",

Then I called and told them that this happened and the girl was super rude and told me that she \"doubted that the guy would want to come back to give me that\" .. I couldn't believe it. You'd think the food would make up for it, but absolutely not. Below average it tasted Like it was cooked days ago and had globs of fat in it. Please don't give them service this was a huge regret I was very upset and unsatisfied.",

    "text": "If you want quick Chinese Food that doesn't break the bank and tastes great at the same time, head to China Cafe.  I've been coming to this place for the past couple of years since I've been a student at the University.  Their lunch specials can't be beat.  Your order really is done in about 5-7 minutes (maybe they should make that a motto) and the portions are generous.  Usually I stop in and order something to go when I'm on my way home but they also have dine-in service that's usually fast and courteous as well.    They have delivery too if you live near the area but I always prefer to just come in and place my order in person.  If you're craving something quick and affordable and you're in the area, China Cafe is the spot.  I'd recommend it over the other Chinese places in the area unless you're in the mood for a high-end experience like House of Leng.",

I always ordered the Sweet & Sour or General Tso's chicken and occasionally would treat myself to some Crab Rangoon. Always tasted great and was ready in 5-7 minutes (which was perfect for call-in, since I lived about 5 minutes away).  I usually picked up on my way to or from campus, but there there also are a number of places to sit inside for table service. Again, don't expect anything fancy with the decor on the inside but the quality (and quantity) of the food more than makes up for it!  As long as you aren't expecting a super trendy, super gourmet Chinese food experience, you won't be disappointed. Give it a try!",

One was so late once that I had to literally send him home with his food and no tip. I told him to keep it after he had knocked on my door after being 30 minutes late and tried to ask for my food back which I threw on the ground. if there was another Chinese delivery place I would order from them instead.

First of all the driver knocked on my door like the police non stop until I opened it (as he always did which was annoying), then he handed me my food then thrust the receipt at me almost yelling \"Tip, tip!\" He didn't even give me time to give him the cash I had on hand. And that wasn't the only time that's happened, the last time I just forgot to select a tip option for my card on the app and planned on just adding a tip to the receipt. The same thing happened, the guy demanded a tip. I'm very easy going and it takes a lot to annoy me but that really did it for me. That was the last time I ordered from them.

Once the food finally got here, it was just plain bad.

DO NOT EAT HERE; HORRIBLE SERVICE AND A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. I'm traveling and have no way to reheat my food. Thanks a lot, assholes. Totally pissed!!! & still no response from GrubHub.",

Any reasonable business would provide the order for free to keep a customer but the gentleman on the phone only offered a $5 discount on a $20 order.

The food is great! Don't expect PF Chang's or some upscale Chinese food.  But for what it is- it's delicious.  I've never had a single problem with this establishment.  I'm sad that I'm moving to concord soon & I won't be able to order delivery from them anymore (it's only 7 exits away so maybe I can visit time to time or pay extra for Uber eats or something).   Enjoy their crab Rangoons, chicken wings, and pineapple fried rice.  They also make really good southern style sweet tea (bc lets be real- us southerners love our tea with a side of diabetes).  I don't know what authentic Chinese food tastes like (it could be authentic idk) but I'm more than happy with China Cafe!",

So yeah never again would I order from China Cafe. I called the Grub Hub to complain but they told me it was delivered by the restaurant. I didn't even try to call them, no point in complaining to them about Grandpa peeing on my property. Grub Hub offered a credit for future use and I appreciate that.",

Crab rangoon appetizer, not the best I've ever had but fried well and had a good sweet & sour sauce served with it.  General Tso's was very good for a take-out joint. The batter was lighter than a lot of other places and I liked it, less breading more chicken! The sauce was great and you can specify your level of spiciness on the ordering menu (I think it just changes the amount of chili peppers they include!).  Got a slice of Carrot Cake for dessert... never again. I could have gotten better carrot cake from a gas station... #sorrynotsorry  Overall a positive experience, there's stuff I know I can order here and some stuff I'll stay away from.
