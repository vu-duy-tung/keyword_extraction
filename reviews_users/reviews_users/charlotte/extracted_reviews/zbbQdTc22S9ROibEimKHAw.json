    "text": "I have been going to Jason's Deli for years as I love the selection of food, the healthy options, and of course the free soft serve froyo!   However, I had the most INCREDIBLE experience at the Jason's Deli in the Epicenter over and over this past weekend while my family was visiting Charlotte. Each and every time we went in (which was a lot, ha ha) we had excellent customer service.  The workers were so genuinely friendly and helpful, you just got a great atmosphere going in there.  It felt like the workers were treated well there and really liked and enjoyed their job. Gabriel, I believe is either the store manager or a manager, I am not sure.  Talk about going above and beyond!  He is phenomenal!  If any higher ups are reading this review (and I hope you are) the entire store deserves a raise, and Gabriel deserves a promotion.   I don't normally feel so compelled to write a glowing review, and I am definitely not a plant.  In fact, if Gabriel is reading this, I'm sure he remembers the family from LA with the baby boy and the grandma who came in frequently and always had such a wonderful time.",

    "text": "There was no free ice cream for our group yesterday.  We arrived at Jason's deli at the epicenter to order just before 1 pm on Sunday, 11/9 and they were ill-prepared for the number of people coming over from two events happening in uptown Charlotte that day.  We finally ordered our food after a lengthy wait only to wait 30 more minutes at a table with no food arrival.  I went up to ask about when our food might be ready as our daughter had to be back to the cheer competition at TWC arena and I was told it was not even started.  I was asked if we wanted it to go which we did not as we cannot bring food into the TWC arena.  This location was totally disorganized and not even apologetic about the wait nor the inability to fulfill our order.  I had to request a refund and even that was problematic (finally got it).  I would never go back to this location.  I am sorry this was my first experience in a Jason's deli location and I will not waste my time again.  Also, I have never written a negative review before so it took a lot to get me to the breaking point to write this review.  Advice: staff up when an event is happening in uptown Charlotte and if you are experiencing volume issues, use common sense customer service and make things right.  A little customer service goes a long way.",

    "text": "I have been to several Jason's Deli locations in the past.  And none seem to be this good.  Maybe it is just that they are located uptown and it is a great place to get lunch during work.  Maybe it is that this location is so nice and brand new.  More likely it is due to the fact that the (free) ice cream at this Jason's is beyond wonderful.  I have never had soft serve that was better than what they offer, ever.  The food is good, decently priced, and varied, but I always get the same thing: the club royale.  It is consistently delicious.  The service is always pretty fast considering the huge crowd that is always there at lunch time.  Everything is very good.  But the ice cream?  The ice cream is downright fantastic.  It is like eating a cup of clouds.",

In addition to being good, it is also endless so you can enjoy as much as you want. Although the food is good, I am writing the review based on the service. I was in this past Sunday and the manager approached us as he saw us looking at the menu displayed on the wall. He asked if we would like to look at menus in hand which had more description and additional choices. After we ordered, our food was very fast and delivered to our table. I was in town visiting friends so we were taking our time and someone came and cleared our plates for us, not in a rushing way, just so we had more space. After our meal I was catching a flight  back to Boston and was in a rush and left without my purse. (It was a small wristlet sized purse). As soon as we got to the car I panicked, and called them. Sure enough they had found it for me. When I returned to grab it, the manager had locked it up for me in his back office. Everything about my experience here made us feel like we mattered to them and they truly appreciated our business.",

    "text": "I received a promotional email this morning announcing their new Salmon Salad. As I hadn't packed lunch for the day, I clicked their site and was excited to see they actually deliver uptown which is extremely helpful to those of us that want a semi-healthy lunch, but don't have the time to fight the long lines up anywhere uptown during lunchtime. I ordered the salmon salad,  a ham sandwich with chips for my boss, and a Rueben with no sides for my coworker. Nothing extravagant. I received an email at 12:36 saying to allow 30 minutes for my order to arrive, so we expected to have our lunch by 1pm, give or take a few minutes. My order did not arrive until1:40pm and every single item was super cold. Needless to say my salmon salad looked absolutely NOTHING like the wonderful picture on the email they sent me to market it. it literally had 1 cherry tomato on it. So, after waiting over an hour for our lunch to arrive, and having a Hangry Boss and coworker,  I am served ice cold (straight from the fridge) salmon on a few greens and 1 cherry tomato? My boss' ham sandwich-- cold. My coworkers Rueben- cold. $40 for a lunch that took too long without a legitimate reason(they couldn't even argue that they were cooking the salmon fresh, and I don't think it takes an hour to make a hams sandwich nor a Reuben and ride a bike a block to deliver it). Won't do this again, lesson learned.",

I walked in wearing nike shorts and horrific American Flag Chuck Taylors and only got judged twice!!! My first experience at jason's deli was a few weeks ago with my good buddy carson. I walked in, and despite the line going all the way to birkdale village, I got right in and ordered the best spud i has ever laid my eyes on. Loaded with deliciously fattening toppings, I ate that potato like it was the last potato in the galaxy. My drink of choice that evening was sweet tea..of course..followed by 11 cups of gourmet Swirl ice cream. so Id say it was a successful Girls night out. My employee that evening was a brunette southern belle named Lacey. I couldn't quite decide which toppings would tickle my fancy so she walked me through every single one without getting upset with me 1 time. I guess you could say i am now a regular:) Roll Tide my friends.",

We had people come by the table several times to check on whether we needed re-fills, to clear our plates, or to just check on us.  I would say it was overkill, but I actually appreciate that the staff is requested to and pleasantly take the extra steps to make sure we're taken care of.  They are way more welcoming and seemingly genuinely interested in making your experience a good one and to appreciate your patronage.  That's way better than Flemings or any of the other restaurants in the area.  Some of them would do better to follow Jason's example in staff professionalism & courtesy.",

Our catering plans fell through and they were very accommodating with an order for 70+ people with only a few days notice. We were provided with a box lunch with sandwich, chips, pickle and dessert. I got the roast beef which was meaty and fresh-just like how I like it! It was refreshing to see a chain sandwich place not servicing slimy roast beef (I judge most places by their sliced roast beef) served along a crisp pickle. And don't even get me started on the brownie--it was ooey, gooey and I made a mess with it (a good thing in my book). The only thing that would've made it better was some free ice cream at the end like you get when you walk in but all in all, I was happy with the grub!",

So I bumped into an old manager from my NationsBank days....yes, I'm also dating myself as does any banker that talks about banks they worked for and names you probably never even heard of....and we decided to do lunch at Jason.  This was a salad day for me...lots of meeting, so a big meal wasn't in the cards, unless I planned on falling half asleep in a meeting lasting hours and hours.  So I didn't get to experience the sandwich line, which wasn't a bad thing as it was almost out the door when we arrived around 11:40 in the morning?!?!?!  I had never been here before, so I followed the lead of my acquaintance as he seems to have been here several times.  There are 2 self serve kiosks for soup/salads, which had very small lines.  I ordered a salad with chicken...went over to my left to the counter where I was given a tray, empty white unbreakable plastic bowl and a small cup of cooked chicken.....though I've never been to prison...\"convicted....no.......never convicted\" I think I may have had a little taste of what it was liked being herded around like sheep with my prison like tray, bowl and fellow eaters all walking around in a well formed process.  The salad bar is good...though basic...nothing very creative here.  We ate, caught up on our work over the years and headed out. The place itself sits on the second floor of the EPICENTER in the corner of College and 4th with lots of windows, so it is light and bright.  The food was fine...pricing wasn't anything special...total for lunch (with water) (was $9.26 with tax = Salad $6.99 + Chicken $1.49 + tax).  Fast....but only if you go the salad route....avg pricing, though $9 for lunch is not cheap if you eat out lunch every day.  All and all a generally good...can be quick depending....lunch spot in the center of town.",

In case anyone hasn't been there, I'll just mention that it's a pretty decent deli. The salad bar is kind of simple, but not a bad option if you are trying to eat your veggies. I like the muffalettas, but if you are not a fan of olives then don't bother. They also have complimentary soft-serve ice cream whether you order the salad bar or not, so that's always a plus (you can even pull a cone while waiting on a to-go order).   Ultimately, the more places that open downtown, the better. As much as it pains me to say it, I think more corporate places like Jason's will actually be good for Charlotte. Why? Because they have normal hours like 11am-10pm instead of only being open for a few hours during lunch--a source of frustration for many who live downtown.",

The atmosphere is very casual and comfortable. And all the workers there are very sweet. Especially Jailyn and Destiny. They deserve raises. I always get the soup of they day and sometimes a turkey sandwich. My daughter loves the kids meals.",

This location in the Epicenter does a very brisk lunch business and, based on the number of times I see their lunch spreads outside meeting rooms at work, a brisk catering business as well.  I really enjoy the chicken pot pie soup and like you can create your own sandwich should one of the menu versions don't fit your tastes quite right.",

Sitting outside I figured the only way I could order the food and not worry about leaving the puppy for too long was to place the order online.  While I was sifting through this process the manager Jason, was continually coming in and out of the restaurant asking customers how there meal was, welcoming them into the restaurant and holding the door for them.  Shortly after he had asked me if he could assist with anything, so I explained how I was trying to order online, ex.  He generously took my order went back inside and placed it for me.  He brought my puppy some water and when my food was done brought it out and didn't charge me a thing.  This is amazing customer service, he was so super friendly, curtious, and cared about his customers - not only that but the food as expected was delish.  I have nothing but good things to say about Jason's Deli in Uptown!",

Its been a while but  i remember getting a half sandwich and salad: (Half-Sandwich with Side Salad, chips & pickle 7.99) combo. Where they will give u a empty salad container and you fill it up as you like.. (no wieghting scale.. so pile it on. for this special)  Today I got the Club Royale  Toasted croissant with smoked turkey breast, ham, bacon, Swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, honey mustard. 6.99  Never been here and had a BAD expierence so that's A PLUS all by itself.",

I saw some cards hanging on a rack and seeing a European sandwich?? listed for what I thought was $1.75, I thought I would be getting more of a tea sandwich size instead of a full blown roast beef because I was getting a soup as well. Imagine my surprise when I was billed almost $13.00 for soup and sandwich. While I was ordering, a girl was attempting to throw hands full of potato chip bags onto a ledge which kept falling on the floor near the register. Guess they didn't train her on what a step stool is. What was really offensive was the man who brought my tray of food stood directly at my table holding my food yelling across the restaurant to a coworker telling her he loved her and bye (not just once, but several times while I'm waiting for him to put my food on the table). The kicker is that two men who appeared to be regional or district managers for the corporation were sitting one table behind me and said nothing. The food wasn't outstanding, the staff is totally unprofessional and I didn't even get a pickle with my sandwich.",

Creamy tomato base, tons of salt combined w/ that long ago prepared taste.

I ordered on 12/28/18 for Delivery on 1/2/19 - a day after a holiday being closed.  It was very easy to go online and place the order with exactly what we wanted (sandwich tray, salad tray, and dessert tray for 10 people).  I also included notes for the delivery person, such as going through security, which I am sure this location is used to with all of the buildings uptown.  I never went to the location, called the location, or talked to the location before or after placing my order.  This was my first time doing this online order, so I had my fingers crossed.  On 1/2/19, the delivery was scheduled for 11:30 AM (Jason's asks for a 30 minute window).  At 11:36 AM I get a call from security to confirm they are to deliver to our floor.  Timely delivery!  The delivery guy (sorry forgot his name) was friendly and handed over the order to me and I signed the receipt.  I was able to quickly get it set up for the office.  Their 10 person \"working lunch\" is more than enough for 10 people, could have definitely fed more as we had leftovers.  It included multiple types of sandwiches, salad tray, and dessert tray.  I would definitely order from this location and order catered lunch easily from Jason's Deli.  Such a hassle free and easy way to get a group lunch.",

    "text": "I've been a fan since the day Jason's Deli opened Uptown. I've tried lots of their menu options as well as their fully-stocked, fresh salad bar. The restaurant is well maintained and clean. My disappointment has been the baked potatoes. I recently discovered the Texas Style Spud. It's delicious!  However, the last two times I ordered it the potato has been burned. You don't know that until you start eating it. What a disappointment. I did call and say something but I never heard from anyone.",

    "text": "Food is good, but I don't understand the purpose of the Jason's deli app.  The last 4 orders I've placed haven't been ready when I give the standard 15 mins to come pick it up.  This last time I waited longer, so that it might be prepared when I arrive (off peak hours, 3pm ish).  In fact, they always have my order, but wait for me to arrive to begin making it.  Normally when a restaurant offers an app to order, it is designed as a time saver, but apparently this does not apply for this Jason's deli location.  I also use my CC online to pay, but every time they need to swipe my card and run it at their register.  Be nice if they introduced some convenience and efficiency to their online ordering system.",

Went there 30 mins before closing and half the salad bar was shut down, teas were put away, etc ...  was clear the workers were leaving before closing time, limited hours in general so caution if not going there during peak hours.",

    "text": "Today was the first time I've been to Jason's Deli and I loved it! They have a great selection of items, sandwiches, salads, pastas, soups, even baked potatoes...pretty cool.   I was surprised to see such a short lunch time, but I'm not complaining. I ordered the manager's special half wild salmon-which and cup of vegetarian tomato basil soup and a side of fruit. Not bad for $8.50 considering all the free goodie bar. I love the pumpkin flatbread crackers, loaded with protein but not calories. Perfect snack especially for work. The meal itself was satisfying and filling. There was a good piece of nicely seasoned salmon on crunchy ciabatta. The fruit was fresh with a little cup of sweet yogurt dipping sauce, so good! The soup was creamy and rich, I doubt it will be my go to soup but it was yummy. I think I will have to go with the vegetarian soup from here on out if I don't want to gain hella weight.   The best part, free ice cream! You will never leave Jason's Deli hungry! We will be frequent customers from here on out. The new shrimp quinoa salad sounds interesting and yummy.",

    "text": "I haven't been to a Jason's in quite some time, but usually when I do, I do the salad bar.  Pile your plate with fresh veggies to your hearts content (looks like they also have added some extras like Caprese Salad and some other pasta salads as toppings).  I usually hit the bar about two times, and then, when I have a great level of a False sense of eating healthy... hit the soft-serve machine.  This location at the EpiCenter is convenient for uptown workers to grab a salad bar lunch - just be choosy on when to head on over since it can get a little crazy.  I've seen the line LITERALLY go out the door during the peak lunch rush.  If salad is not your thang, they have soup/sandwich combos and even some pasta dishes (made to order).  They will give you a number and the nice server folks will bring it to your table.  The dining room layout has a ton of tables and booths... they are located on the corner of the EpiCenter so they have a bunch of tables next to windows (which you find out quickly that they are pretty popular) especially if you sit in a cubicle with no windows all day long.  If you can't spare a second, you can get your order to go - This location also caters a lot of lunch meetings so you will see the many carts with soft coolers on them for when they transport the goods.",

    "text": "So, yes. I want to up my rating, but not by much.  As mentioned in my previous review I am a fan of Jason's Deli and frequent other locations as well.  However, based on the fact I work uptown this location is my option.  I love the large menu and have been trying different soups and sandwiches and have enjoyed them all, even though some weren't right. So, along with my original review, they still have an issue with errors on take out and call ahead orders, but have gotten better.  I have enjoyed my dine-in visits and again love the options available. I think anyone can find something on their menu! Will continue to visit, but be sure to check my orders better so I don't end up back and my desk to only realize my order was wrong, which has happened to me.",

My favorites would have to probably be the Sante Fe Chicken sandwhich or the Papa Joe. I work in Uptown, so this is a crowd-pleaser amongst all of my co-workers.   I usually grab the 'Manager's Special' which is a 1/2 & 1/2 deal. I get 1/2 a sandwhich, a cup of soup AND a side (chips, steamed veggies, ect). What a great deal. AND YOU GET FREE ICE CREAM! The child in me rejoices anytime someone says they want to grab lunch here.",

    "text": "Love Jason's Deli! Come here often for work lunches as you always get a good sandwich, soup and salad bar if you so choose.   Recently I went here because I lost a crown, so I needed something soft....think SOUP! And Jason's has a REALLY good soup selection! So I got their chicken noodle and a chicken breast on croissant (soft) as I made my own sandwich. That's another thing I love about Jason's....you can make your OWN sandwich. How cool is that? Of course, they offer some really good Standard selection sandwiches.   There's something for everyone here. A great place to \"pig out\" OR great place to watch your calories as they have numerous healthy options as well. And their salar bar rocks....just watch the Ranch Dressing....IF you slather your salad with that, might as well get their double Pastrami!  Oh, don't forget they give you \"free\" frozen custard if you get a salad bar (I think). Always great in the summer.",

Great salad bar, awesome sandwiches and quality soups are always available and consistency is a strong point.   The downfall for this Jason's is that it's located in a myriad of restaurants and can be overlooked easily. Meanwhile, it's a inexpensive, quality meal where you can get in and out in minutes if need be.",
