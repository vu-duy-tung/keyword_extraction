    "text": "Had breakfast here today for the first time.  While the service was pleasant enough, the excessive pricing for ordinary quality food was disappointing.  But the most disappointing was the \"Strawberry\" Pancakes.  There may have been 1 or, at most, 2 strawberries sliced and laid on top of the stack of 3 decent pancakes.  And they weren't even juicy or sweet strawberries -- sour, even tart.  Not even any whipped cream to attempt to mask the puny amount of strawberries on top.  To rescue my meal I decided to simply separate the unremarkable strawberries from the pancakes and enjoyed the pancakes sans strawberries, essentially paying $1.50 or so for a \"side\" consisting of just 1 (possibly 2) not-so-tasty strawberry.",

    "text": "I was introduced to this place by a small group of folks who highly recommended it.  Our group comes twice a month on Sundays to enjoy a good, reasonably priced meal.  No qualms with the food at all.  However, the last two times we've gone, a waitress (different one on these two occassions) rudely came up to our table and asked us to leave as they needed our table. This last time she said people were lined up, waiting on tables.  I got up to look and well, one group of four was waiting.  Really?   We had been there 45 minutes, waiting 20 minutes for our food to come and don't want to be pushed out the front door.   I understand this establishment makes their money by the turnaround of tables, but quite frankly, so what?  It just doesn't make sense to me if you want to keep loyal customers, don't start pushing them out the door.  Not sure if I'll go back with my group.",

The waitress took our drink order , then another waitress came and asked us also. When she returned with drinks and to take order I asked her to give us a minute to look at menu and she returned to to our order. My husband ordered a patty melt, fries and okra. I ordered a fish sandwich. A young man came to table to refill the jelly container. An older man walked by and said they were not as busy as usual and were trying to find things to do. Our meals came out as ordered, and I asked for tarter sauce. I waited for awhile, then flagged down another waitress and asked again. She came back and said they were out and are making it, she said someone should have come out and told us. Ten minutes have passed and the older guy walked by and I asked him. He said 'Yeah, they are making it and I hope you get it before you are done.' I haven't eaten yet and food is getting cold. My husband is almost finished. I got up and went to register and asked another lady if she was the owner. She said no and pointed to the older guy who said he hoped I got it before I finish my meal. I went back to table and sat and then they finally brought it out. The waitress said \"Sorry, it was not intentional.\" I said that it is okay, I will be sure to write a review. Our drinks were not even refilled until we asked for our bill. The owner really has a care- less attitude, and needs to learn some customer service skills. We will not return.",

Oh my, it was the worst food I have ever had.  If all the rrestaurants in the world disappear I still wouldn't eat at this place.  If I could give it a 1/4 star or even no rating, I would.  I think all of their food is frozen, not a single thing is fresh which is funny because there are tons of fresh produce markets in the area.  I can't say one good thing about the food, or even the coffee! I wouldn't even feed this food to my dog. Let me at least say what we ordered: I had the country hash (I can't believe I paid $7 for that garbage), my husband had an omlette ($7 plus $2 for 2 extra toppings), and my daughter had pancakes. I just don't know how this place can mess up breakfast so badly.",

The hash browns appeared to have been made much earlier (maybe the night before) and were essentially almost mashed potatoes that had been fried in a pan.  The outsides were burned and the inside was like mush.  My \"corned beef hash\" was actually not corned beef hash at all, but rather pan fried corned beef on top of the same poorly cooked hash browns.

    "text": "This was by far the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant. I have been in the service industry for over 10 years and I can't imagine ever giving someone the kind of service my husband and I received here. We waited 10 mins for a table which we expected on a Sunday afternoon, but that wasn't the problem. Our food took over 40 mins to come out. The restaurant wasn't even super busy. We never saw our waitress after she took our order and when we finally did I politely asked if our food was going to come out soon because we needed to get going. The manager came out and told us \"you should know your food is going to take 20-30 mins when you come at 1pm on a Sunday afternoon, and you shouldn't be in a hurry\" then he said our food was probably sitting in the window waiting to be ran but nobody was competent enough to run it... Extremely unprofessional. Our food finally came out and it was wrong. I ordered blueberry pancakes and two over medium eggs. The eggs came out scrambled, and the pancakes were just regular with no blueberries. I honestly was so fed up I just decided to eat it anyways. The pancakes were cold and just not good so I didn't eat them. I decided to go ahead and eat the scrambled eggs when the manager came out to the table and said \"hope those scrambled eggs are good that you're eating that belong to someone else\" and then put over medium eggs down on the table in front of me and walked away. I couldn't even believe what just happened. At this point I was really upset and just asked for our check to leave. We will definitely never be going back!",

Our LAST visit was horrid. The waitress was nice enough but the food, ugh! My husband ordered Philly cheesesteak without peppers, fries and onion rings. I ordered a chicken gyro with fries. When our food was delivered his had peppers on it and mine was beef gyro. The waitress said she would be back with the fries and onion rings and was gone for about 5 mins before she returned saying she gave us the wrong food. Apparently there was a similar order as ours, however the other 4 tables that were there never got any food similar to ours. Hum. So, I decided to keep mine...his went back...still no fries or rings at this point. Another few minutes they arrive...soaked in grease. The fries we actually good but the rings were barely cooked. Once my husbands sandwich came back he could literally squeeze the grease out of it.   Customer service....no manager stopped by, no real apology...so we paid our bill and left. We will not be returning until there is a new name on that building. Very disappointing",

We found Omega Coney Island one day and decided to try it.  The best part of this establishment is the friendly people.  We enjoy the waitresses and the owners; the food is better than what is offered at local mom & pop type places in Charlotte, but it's not outstanding either.  I usually get my eggs scrambled because I've had to send my over medium eggs back on a few occasions as they were undercooked - clear and runny.  Their marinated chicken breasts with eggs are pretty good, but steer clear of the hash browns as they're horrible!  They taste so frozen that no amount of ketchup makes them edible.  Today we went and I tried a gyro and fries...  again- edible, but nothing to write home about.    I'd say that Omega Coney Island needs to stop trying to introduce us southerners to Detroit and try more to embrace how we southerners like our food as we're the ones paying the bills.",

Fille our coffee often, brought our food out quickly etc.  The food which is why you go out to eat was another story: We ordered Farmers Omelet and Chicken with waffles. When they came out they looked fine.   The Omelette was filled with a selection of crunchy hard burnt veggies ,raw hash browns and some sort of burnt meat scraps...I ate around the filling so I only had some scrambled egg crepe basically . I had a biscuit instead of toast which is a mistake if you like biscuits , they are the pre made frozen ones they just defrost to serve.   The Chicken and waffle came out . My friend had asked that pecans be mixed into the waffle. what she got was a frozen pre made waffle with some chopped pecans thrown on top . The chicken strips served on top were again pre made frozen and just heated up there.  We left more on the plate then we ate, they never asked if we liked it or why we left it on our plate. Here is a note to restaurant owners. If I want to eat microwaved frozen food I can do it at home for far cheaper. The check for this menu was 23.00, for food I wouldn't feed my dog or bother to bring home the scraps for them.  Add to list  Edit",

I had hash browns and when I told her they were not at all good she said, \"oh. Sorry\" and walked away. She never came to refill my coffee - thankfully other waitresses were attentive enough to refill it.  The food is always only mediocre here. The hash browns tasted TERRIBLE! They were mushy and had a very odd/bad taste as if they had gone bad or they absorbed  a really foul odor from the freezer. My waitress didn't seem to care at all.  Save yourself the time & money. There are plenty of other restaurants nearby that are much better and worth the price.  Something else I witnessed: a waitress spilled hot coffee, from the pot, on a little boy and not one staff member checked to make sure he was ok. He was in shock and the manager saw it and nobody did anything. It was an accident but it shows very poor customer service that at least two of the staff knew it happened and didn't address it.",

I was able to flag down another waitress to ask for more hash browns but she never returned with them.  After waiting 20 minutes and no hash browns were brought I had to flag down our waitress that walked by us many times to check on all her \"regular\" customers to get our check and have the hash browns taken off my bill.  If you aren't a \"regular\" there or personally know people that work there you will not get good service.  We've gone before and was only ok at best and will definitely not be back.

In a very warm and laid back atmosphere, you won't find a better place to fill your tummies with the fresh, local and high quality food it has.  The service staff is very family friendly. I was impressed how sweet and patient they were with my 1-yr old nephew as he put pancakes and bananas on the floor. They never batted an eye and were sweet and playful with him. The owner even brought his \"favorite toy truck\" for my nephew to play with while we ate. Besides the wonderful customer service, you can't find anywhere else great breakfast food all day. The bacon is cooked to perfection, my pancakes were fluffy and sweet, and my omelette was stuffed with the most delicious vegetables.  If you are in the Charlotte/Rock Hill area and are looking for a top notch place to eat (especially breakfast any time of day), drive on down Old Monroe and stop in at the Omega Coney Island. Your stomachs will be very happy.",

    "text": "I have eaten breakfast lunch and dinner at Omega Coney Island restaurant and every time it has been delicious. I have read some of the other reviews so I wanted to wait until I had tried it a few times before I made my final decision and I have to say I love this restaurant. The first time I went was for lunch and I had a club and french fries which I know seems pretty simple but a lot of places can't seem to do it well however the Omega club was yummy and their fries are scrumptious. The second time I went I had the most amazing Italian wedding soup it was the best soup that I have ever eaten you could tell it was homemade and it was made by somebody who knew exactly what they were doing I could go there every day and just get this soup. I also had a Mushroom Swiss burger and french fries the hamburger was cooked to perfection juicy and exquisite, the french fries perfect as usual. The Omega offers breakfast all day everyday so this evening I decided to try breakfast for dinner I had the western omelette hash browns and grits with cheese all were perfectly cooked and absolutely delightful. I also had the homemade vegetable soup and again whoever makes this soup is a master it was absolutely divine. I know when you're driving past the Omega it's not much to look at and when you go inside it's not really fancy but the food is prepared fresh the menu is extensive from at least 5 different kinds of hot dogs, Gyros, pitas, hamburgers, sandwiches, Patty melts, salads, full dinner plates and every kind of breakfast items you could ask for it really is worth a try in fact several. The the service is friendly OnPoint if you need anything they're quick to get it and make sure you have everything you need to make your dining experience perfect. I highly recommend that you try this restaurant as soon as possible side note they have delicious macaroni and cheese.",

    "text": "Soooo this place is either hit or miss. Today there wasn't even a swing.  My wife and I Have dined here several times and have had 3 star experiences at best.  We love the location , option of lunch or breakfast and the small town feel. That is why we continue to come back. ...or should I say continued, past tense.  Today we were greeted with a warm welcome and sat at a booth in the back.  Took several mins for the warm welcome lady to come back and get our order.  We were in the mood for lunch so my wife ordered the chicken gyro and I ordered the Philly steak with no peppers.  We also ordered an order of onion rings ( gotta love onion rings!)  About 5 mins after taking our order my wife's gyro arrived. It was regular not chicken. The host/busser/server said that my sandwich would be out in a min. My wife likes regular gyros, so she decided to eat on with out pointing out the mistake.  No biggie , right?   A few mins later my philly steak came out and it did have peppers . I  would have just rolled on with the sandwich, but our server came back and said that she brought the wrong order to the table and that I had someone else's food. (Three other tables in the place and all eating breakfast)  She took my food away and said mine will be \"right up\".   Several mins later we received our onion rings. You can't mess up onion rings  can you? Why as a matter of fact you can.  Let's just say that they cooked my rings on the fly. And by fly, I mean they must have flown right past the fryer and on to the plate.  So undercooked ! Crazy.   ...sorry I am a little passionate about my fried food.   Finally my Philly steak arrives and it looks great.  Unfortunately It was also made in haste.When I picked it up,the grease had already eaten threw the bread. I actually love greasy food , but wow. I could have used the grease on my plate to finish cooking my onion rings.   No concern or compensation from our server/host/cashier/busser.   I know that this is a lengthy review  with some value added sarcasm , but I assure you it is accurate. My wife and I agreed that it was our last visit until we start hearing better things about Omega.",

    "text": "It's a great local diner. Family friendly with guests and staff of all ages. I'm from out of town, but I've eaten here several times over the years.  The breakfast is classic Diner fare, with Grilled combos (the Waffles have some malt!), Country hash, egg combos and omelette. I can't get French toast like their specialty Challa French Toast here... twice as thick as Texas toast, cinnamon-y and chewy with plenty of the French egg dip. Recommended!  They also have Detroit hot dogs (thus the coney name?), Gyros, Pita dishes, chicken tenders, and 1/3 lb burgers. Hand pattied on site, they're thick and juicy, and their grill has been well seasoned over the years. The French Fries on the side were coated in something before being fried, so the outside comes out extra crispy and chewy while the inside is very potato without feeling extra oily.  They also have dinners... which I've not tried yet, because Brunch is so amazing. Typical diner dinner options, with the addition of gyros, meatloaf, and lasagna.  One of my big things about service is I don't like to run out of water or drink. During the writing of this review (finished half my meal), I've been checked on three times, despite it being a fairly \"prime time\" Sunday brunch time. They don't always bring all your food at the same time, but that works for me: let's me eat when I'm hungry, and the second plate was still hot by the time I got to it! I'm a happy camper.",

First off our to-go food was made at the same time our in-dining food was made and instead of realizing the mistake our server just put it under a hot lamp.  We should have demanded that they make it again from scratch, instead we told the manager/owner and he took the meal off of our bill.  When we brought back the to-go order it was terrible from sitting out so long.  I do appreciate that it was not on the bill though.   While we were waiting to pay we watched our server make a salad using her NON gloved hands.  Her hands have been cleaning tables, writing down orders and whatever else that I do not want to imagine.  This is so unsanitary and disgusting.   I'm not sure I could bring myself to go there again.",

Just not good. I'd like to think I'm a connoisseur of onion rings. The looked great on the plate. But at best they were lukewarm. And no crunch but it was a nice serving size.

There were no salt and pepper shakers on any table and no ketchup, though she did bring some packets.  I ordered a mid day breakfast since there were no veggies for a hot meal.  I did not even receive my toast that should have came with the meal.  They need to simply close earlier if the employees and management are COMPLETELY checked out.  I sure did not pay any less than full menu price, but sure did not receive full menu price in food or service.

Prompt friendly service.  Extensive menu. I had a Southern Omlette, w/ sausage gravy, hash browns, wheat toast, a side of bacon, and a Coke and OJ.  The omelette was OK, although the gravy was unappealing. The toast was well buttered (unlike many other places). The hash browns were perfect! And the side of bacon was EXCELLENT! 8 slices of medium thick hickory flavored bacon cooked to perfection,- NOT overdone!  The Coke was large, and cold. The OJ was very fresh and tasty. I only ordered a medium OJ, and noticed later that everyone else there ordered large OJ's. I also noticed that pancakes were quite popular with other customers.  I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "This is the first time eating at this restaurant. I chose rice with chicken. There were not many people in the restaurant the service was very slow. Our waitress took our order but never showed up again. Someone else brought the food. No one poured more drinks. When we finished I had to yell out to see if we could get a desert..they let us know they were out of deserts! I even had to yell out for the bill. We were not instructed to take our receipt to the cashier so we sat there for 15 minutes waiting for someone to come back in to the dining room up and let us know how to pay! To make a long story short, that will be my last trip to Omega Coney Island Restaurant. VERY POOR SERVICE. Food very fried and greasy.",

This restaurant is a home cooking style establishment with great service and great food. I eat here every weekend and have never had a bad meal or bad service. The hostess is always friendly and the servers awesome. They can be busy and your food comes out in a timely manor.",

They are great as well. When I go to a restaurant I have to order the sweet tea. To me that is a sign of how down home you really are. The sweet tea was perfect!! The hash browns were tasty and crispy just the way I like them to be. What a great place to come for breakfast anytime of the day.  The service was excellent too. Winning!!",
