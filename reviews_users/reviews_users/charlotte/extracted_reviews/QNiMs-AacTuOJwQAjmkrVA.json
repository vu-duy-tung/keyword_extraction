I hope people understand that opening a new restaurant, things aren't going to be perfect from the start. There are bound to be growing pains. THAT being said, Philip was our server and he was SO helpful!  He was able to tell us the most popular dishes on the menu and explain their ingredients and flavors. Our entire family enjoyed everything we ordered, specifically because of his help. He was friendly and attentive. If you like Indian food, or if it's new to you and you are up for an adventure with new flavors, definitely try this place! My entire family agrees...even the 15 and 12 year old!",

Initial experience was very good with friends staff and bar tender. They have lots of varieties for authentic Indian dishes. We ordered Chili Chicken, Lamb Chops and Samosa for appetizer everything was very delicious. And for the main course we ordered Methi Chicken, Lamb Roganjosh, Chicken Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan, Butter Naan and Steamed Rice. I would say all the dishes were complete authentic with the feel of every spices. The good part was on food that it wasn't much oily unlike other Indian restaurants and spice level was perfect. Finally out dinner ended with delicious dessert Gulab Jamun.  We really had a great time at this place and would highly recommend local community.",

Naan was a little overcooked, did not have the fluffy inside that I remember from some other great Indian restaurants.

I being Indian have obviously tried almost all the Indian restraunts around Charlotte, and this place def is one of my favorites. They have a mix of all type software Indian food, North and South Indian which I loved. They had chaat which is my favorite. We got veg Manchurian and several puri for appetizers and these were great! My husband and I both Loved the Manchurian, some of the beat we have had. The entrees were huge. They were delicious as well, just enough spice. The flavors were great. The garlic Naan was a little too garlic for me but it was still fresh and food. We will def be going back here again so glad they finally got an Indian place in Fort mill!!",

    "text": "On our way to South Carolina we stayed over in Fort Mill and tried this restaurant. Worst Indian food and restaurant I've ever eaten in. I should have been tipped off by the amount of empty seats on a Sunday evening at 6:30. My companion and I  asked for MILD as in our many past experiences with Indian food, its easier to add spices than remove them, and we do not like excessively HOT food. For appetizer we shared Chili Baby Corn. We could only finish half between us because it was so HOT! We reminded our waiter to make sure the entrees were MILD and he said okay with no apologies for the bad appetizer. We ordered Diwani Handi and Vegetable Biryani for entrees. Again, each plate was too HOT to eat. The waiter suggested that it was possibly because our taste buds were affected by the HOTNESS of the appetizer. Again, no apologies, just a blank uninterested expression. We asked that the food be wrapped for takeout, thinking maybe it would be MILDER the next day. He tossed a couple of foam containers on the table for us to package the food ourselves. The next day the food was still too HOT to eat and it went into the garbage.  I emailed our experience to the restaurant management and have received no reply. My mistake was a simple one. I should have left the food there and refused to pay the bill. Lesson learned.",

Felt like chicken from previous day. I checked with them and again no apology. I ordered chicken tikka instead and that was made well. However no one cared to even check if that was OK. My entree butter chicken was good along with naan. Overall the service was below average and the quality was horrible.

Being of Indian American heritage I have found a few really good places in Charlotte but i probably won't be returning to this one. For the clientele they have, it works but you know an Indian restaurant is to die for when you see a lot of other Indian people flocking to it. The food was average, the servers didn't have any knowledge of Indian Cuisine or the culture and wasn't really worth the price point. This is not the same Persis as the other chains so your food expectations probably shouldn't be as high if you choose to eat here.",

I was dying for some Chicken Vindaloo but it wasn't on the lunch menu that day so I couldn't order it. I was also told that because Chicken Vindaloo is too spicy for most people, it will not be part of their lunch menu. That's an interesting strategy - limiting the menu to a point where you will lose business. Today they lost my business along with that of the four other people that I was going to order takeout for.   I do like the food here but I'll find another restaurant to satisfy my craving for Indian. Just too frustrating to give Persis my business.",

Though I think the guy was new because he didn't know any answers to the few questions we had, he had to bring someone over to help him. Either way somosas were really good. The thing is all sauces to me were lacking taste and knots watered down. The Tamarind sauce was so watery and lacked flavor. I got chicken tiki Marsala. Positive was the chicken was super tender. The sauce had green peppers in it which I found odd and really that's all I could taste. The sauce definitely needed more flavor and more creaminess. Again almost like it was watered down (not saying it was but drawing the parallel of taste). My husband got vindaloo. It was good but again taste was off. It was more like a chili pepper paste sauce, not creamy at all. His had better flavor but just not traditional Indian like you would expect. Overall little disappointing as reviews made the place sound better. The plus is the people are super nice and helpful. I hope they continue to evolve the flavors and would try again if so!",

We have tried the following dishes (always with a side of garlic naan):  Chicken Tikka Masala Palak Paneer Butter Chicken Chicken Korma Navratan Korma   The best dish by far is the Chicken Tikka Masala. The Butter Chicken is very similar in flavor, but I would recommend sticking with the Tikka Masala sauce. Both dishes include white meat chicken cooked in a tandoor clay oven. If you prefer dark meat, you may want to try something else. We have tried many Indian restaurants over the years. The Tikka Masala here is one of the best.  If you prefer vegetarian, I would recommend the Palak Paneer. The main ingredients are pureed spinach, cottage cheese, and traditional herbs and spices. Not many Americans think of spinach as delicious, but trust me ...this is not your average spinach dish! It's very flavorful and not what you would expect of a spinach dish.  The Korma sauce is so-so here. I have had better at other restaurants. We always end the meal with my favorite Indian dessert- rasmalai. It includes milk, cardamom, and rose water. My husband says it tastes the way shampoo smells. I love it, definitely a must-try!  The only constructive criticism I have to offer is regarding the spice level of dishes. There is no consistency at most Indian restaurants. Some servers here have asked if we want mild, medium, or hot dishes....others have asked us to pick a number 1-5 for how spicy we want it, others have offered a 1-10 scale. The spice level is never consistent.   Recently, we ordered two dishes with the same spice level (medium), but while one dish was mildly spicy, the other was extremely spicy. It would be nice if there was one spice scale and the measurement of spice added to the dish was consistent based on that scale. This would ensure that every time I order a dish, I can expect consistency.    Overall 5 stars, highly recommend. We will back to try the Biryani and Tandoori dishes...(I also hope they add Bhindi Masala to the menu at some point!)",

It's located in the Lowe's plaza in fort mill which was quite a busy area when we went there around 5:00. The food was really good. I was afraid that it wouldn't be accessible to my Americanized palette but the staff were very helpful pointing us in the right direction. It is very easy to get something quite spicy as some of the members of our party found out, so I recommend asking questions. The shrimp tiki masala and butter chicken were two of our favorites. The nan was also good which is basically their version of a roll or bread with dinner. My only knock on persis is the pricing which seems a bit high for what you get. All a in all however it was a good experience and even if you're not sure you'd like Indian food I think you'll be able to find something you'd enjoy at persis.",

    "text": "WOOOHOOOOOO!! Alright, FINALLY the wish for my most favorite cuisine in my own area has been blessed and Persis FortMill ROCKS!! Now Persis is the only Indian restaurant in the whole FortMill area.  Having moved to the area not very long ago, I was worried not to have a place for Indian food near by and normally we would drive all the way to Ballantyne or Pineville to calm the nerves.  Me and my lady  personally cannot be more happier !! Unique - Yes, the owners of this location has made it a point that their restaurant shouldn't look like just another Indian restaurant and they scored it big time.  Amazing contemporary interior design, with India's TajMahal mural on the right side wall of the restaurant (giving an feel of India) and an amazing brick panel walls and semi rustic wood shelves and trim in the bar area on the left side of the restaurant.  They have this beautiful mini wine cellar, which I have not seen before in any non-luxury Indian restaurants.  Tall ceilings, spacious area, plenty seating - booths, tables/chairs, plenty bar stools around the bar, etc., The bar looks sassy and I love that bar.  Have not had any drinks in the bar though so not sure how the bartender is but the look of that bar is amazing and hey they have this BlueMoon beer light sign (so I was sold instantly).  The rustic looking wooden shelves on the walls having various wine and liquor bottles gives that warmth to the bar and make it look more lively. FOOD - I found my new favorite now.  Its Cut Mirchi (chili pepper and chickpea batter deep fried).  Never knew Cut Mirchi and beer would go so well together.  Its a simple vegetarian appetizer.  if you like spicy bites, go for it.  It comes with a side of tangy mint chutney that is just damn awesome. Egg Curry - Simple yet so decadent.  Mildly spiced, with a touch of tangy flavor, lots of eggs cut in halves, and plenty portion.  Two of us couldn't finish it and had to pack to go. Loved the flavors and taste.   Chicken Biryani - I wouldn't say it was out-of-the-world taste but still delicious.  Aroma was great, chicken was perfectly cooked, long grained basmati rice sure had the quality, mildly spiced and good portion for two to share.  Egg curry and the biryani together was the bomb. Complimentary - Fryums(that's what I call them) and Chutneys was good and the chutneys was tasting so good along with pickled onions. Service - was good too, the owners themselves were running most of the show.  They welcomed all the guests, periodically visited the tables to make sure the guests were doing fine, asked if the food was tasting good, etc.,  for a restaurant this young (5 weeks old) they are doing a good job.  I am sure they would need a lot more support and hands once this runs full house every night. Had a chance to talk to the owners, they seemed really down to earth and taking this business very seriously.  I also talked about having a Yelp event to bring in more traffic and get this place the ultimate fame it deserves.",

    "text": "I REALLY want to like this place, because I've waited a long time for Indian food in Fort Mill. But to be honest, it was a REALLY bad experience, due to a very unprepared staff. Here's why:  1. Our waiter was totally inept. We knew right away things were going to be rough when we asked for a glass of Merlot, and he asked us \"is that some sort of champagne or something?\" He was very unfamiliar with the menu, and forgot to put in multiple things we asked for. Bread never came, some drinks never came. He looked very confused, and his hands were even shaking at one point. I don't blame him. He was trying his best, but he clearly wasn't trained well.  2. It took over an hour to get our food after we ordered it. There must have been some mixup because after the manager realized we had been sitting so long, it came out promptly.  3. When our entrees finally did come, they came out before the rice and naan. Indian food is all sauce and therefore must be eaten with rice or bread. They brought our entrees with neither. When rice did come it was one small single serving for our entire table of 5. We split that between our two kids (who were starving by this point) and the rest of us sat their for about 15 more minutes waiting for more rice, while our entrees got cold. By the time another tiny bowl of rice came, our kids had finished and wanted seconds. So we waited again for more rice. The bread we ordered never came until we were done eating.  4. The bartender was rude, and likely over worked. She was mean, and it looked like it was because she had way more than she could handle.  The food was pretty good once it came. Not the best I've had, but definitely not bad either. Portions were VERY small, however that seems to be typical at some Indian restaurants. I definitely recommend ordering naan to help fill you up, because there's only about 4 or 5 pieces of meat in it.  The manager did realize things were going poorly, and gave a bunch of tables free deserts, which was nice. But that's not enough to give me confidence in returning. My impression is that they are nice people, and just need more time to figure things out. So I will wait a month or so and try again, and update my review if things have improved.",

We read some of the reviews which generally said it was great but that they were working out the kinks from just opening. WOW, what a huge understatement. This place is a joke at best.  We called the restaurant to order carry out but no answer. After a few attempts I just drove there to order. They were about 1/3 full of customers but I stood at the hostess desk for about 5 minutes before I could catch anyone to place an order. I finally got a guys attention (manager/owner maybe) and he had me go to sit at the bar for takeout. I thought he was going to take my order. Nope. I waited another 3-4 minutes before I could place my order. As I waited at the bar for for another 45 minutes, not one person asked if I wanted anything to drink or updated me that the order was going to be another 15 minutes. And even the people to my left waited 15 minutes just to get the extra refill they asked for. So, 80 minutes after we tried to call and 60 minutes after I ordered we finally got our meal. Ugh, it was sooo bad. Such a waste of my life. This place had messed up Tikka Masala, the naan was so bad and their eggplant dish was like vomit. It did not even have the coconut and peanut flavors it described. It's was like they found someone in the street to cook from a bad recipe off the internet.  My wife makes better Tikka and naan than this place. Seriously, if you have patience and want to waste a ton of time and see what I'm talking about, just go there and see for yourself. It would've been quicker for us to drive into Charlotte for some good Indian than waste it on this place. So disappointing.  They may be better off closing their doors and stop shaming quality Indian food and hospitality.",

We tried the chicken curry and it was amazing. Great for hogging with friends, co workers and family !",

My favorites are the chicken tikka masala, TANDOORI CHICKEN which comes out the clay oven. Yum yum yum! Jeers rice mixed with cilantro and herbs AMAZING! Lunch combos during the week oh yeah the lamb was perfect. They also offer vegetarian options which is good. Full service bar and servers are always friendly and helpful. Definitely one of my favorite places to go . Prices are good and they offer drink specials everyday as well. The decor is nice and owner says he plans on putting up outdoor seating which I'm looking forward to!",

    "text": "My wife and I came across this restaurant as it is in the plaza closest to the hotel in which we were staying. We don't have a lot of Indian options in our hometown so we thought \"why not?\".   I was a bit over zealous, or maybe just not as hungry as my stomach was telling me...so we ordered samosa and chicken Manchurian as appetizers. Both dishes were phenomenal, the chicken Manchurian was medium spicy and the right amount of flavor, really complex and layered.   We had ordered chicken curry and methi chicken for our entrees, by the time they arrived we were so full we had to ask for them to be boxed up...but not without trying a fresh bite first. Let me tell you the chicken curry is an explosion of flavor. If you're not a fan of curry I'd still recommend you trying this dish; it's not overwhelming curry and spiced just right. The methi chicken was creamy and well balanced. For context-I am writing this now while eating the leftover entree and have to say it is just as good as when it was first served.  We will be coming back to the Fort Mill area for business and visiting friends but now we  also have a restaurant that I will look forward to each visit.",

I was starting to relax....BUT....  A family walked in with a baby and a 2 year old. The two year old would not stop screaming. He was obviously tired and needed to be at home. Both parents were oblivious to this and sat there anyway. The waitress didn't help...she went to play with the baby.   By this tine, the restaurant was crowded with ADULT diners. This family disrupted every single diners' meals with their screaming children.  To make matters worse, I wasn't even halfway through my meal when the waitress slapped the check on my table and told me to notify her if \"I needed a box\". 5 minutes later, another waitress picked up the bill and asked if \"I were ready to cash out\". No, I am not finished with my meal!!!! Good grief.   Persis, good food, could be great atmosphere, but wow....",

    "text": "So my job took me to South Carolina this time, and as always I had to find a Indian restaurant. I came across this particular one due to yelps \"hot and new\" badge. I read some of the reviews and was a bit skeptical, but decided to go anyway. Soon as I walked in I was greeted by a server, and sat at the bar. Bartender took care of me as soon as my butt touched the seat. Corona was nice and cold, and limes were cut thick enough to get some juice out of them. I was presented with a small appetizer to enjoy while I waited for my meal. I ordered the chicken tikka masala, with garlic naan. Food arrived fairly quickly and I got down to it and enjoyed it. Overall, the food is good, the vibe is dope and service was excellent in my opinion.   The only downsides were:  *spicy food level felt like mild. Needs to be hotter. *did not like that the chicken tikka masala was cooked with green bell peppers, never had it. Prefer that they keep it original.  Would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the spicy level and the bell peppers. Still, if you like Indian, I'd recommend checking it out.",

When it came time to pay the check for my wife and myself t seemed quite high for the two of us , $60, but I went ahead and added 20% for the tip. When my wife saw that our total was $72 she grabbed the check from me and checked it out. Found that they had already added in 18% gratuity and not only didn't say anything but the recommended tips were listed at the bottom of the bill. Needless to say we scratched out our added tip and when we mentioned this to our table mates we found they had made the same mistake. We felt like we were deceived. For that reason alone we won't be back. Make sure to check your bill thoroughly!",

    "text": "First time here, new place in town and I came in to get takeout on New Years Eve.   The app Fort Mill Location isn't available so I drove in. I have a shellfish allergy so I wanted to ask questions. -1 Star for the location being unavailable in the app.   I was greeted near immediately at the front and was brought to the bar to put in my order. The waitress was polite and brought a glass of water and a snack while waiting.   We ordered 3 dishes:  1. Chili Chicken (spicy) 2. Tandoori Chicken (medium level spice)  3. Chicken Biryani Boneless (mild level spice)   The snack was little fried crisps with 3 dipping items: something sweet, something with mint and then a tomato/cilantro type salsa. The tomato/cilantro was killer and had a nice little bite. Really good for being a simple ingredient item.   The restaurant itself was clean since it's brand new. The layout is odd since this place wasn't a restaurant before, high ceilings and a fair bit of empty space. My guess is you could fit 60 in here. Basic decor, a few TVs here and there, nothing remarkable.   It was pretty steady in terms of foot traffic and phone orders, everyone seemed to be taken care of well considering it's a new place - a good sign for me. Additionally they did a good job explaining on the phone what is or isn't spicy and gave good wait times on takeout orders.   I spoke to one of the owners who offered some Mango Lassi while waiting. He was very polite and explained some of the growing pains - new staff, wrong orders and crazy wait times since there have been 2 news articles on this location.   Onto the food!  Chili Chicken - 4/5 - great flavors and cooked well. Had just enough spice to get you sniffing but everyone has different tolerances. I really enjoyed it and the portion size was good for 2.   Tandoori Chicken - 3/5 - a touch on the dry side but the flavor was great. I got 2 legs, scored to cook faster I'd imagine. Unfortunately I didn't realize it comes with nothing so the value for me wasn't there. Spice in terms of heat wasn't bad at all, maybe a 3/10 - it was like a hot sauce type profile.   Chicken Biryani Boneless- 4.5/5 - to me this was the star of the show. The chicken was great, definitely a bite to it. The rice was perfectly done and had a really nice texture. The seasonings in general were balanced and not too much cilantro. I'd get this dish again.   Overall I would give this place another shot but in person. The value for take out wasn't there for me - $43.xx for 3 dishes. It fed 2 people but we won't have leftovers - which I'd expect at this price point.   My final word: give it a shot and experiment the menu! It seems this place is worthwhile and can offer some good cuisine.",

I was quite irritated today while going there for a team lunch.food was good but while we payed we gave them 5 cards to split it evenly.owners were stingy about the % fees from swiping each card.its part of the business obviously. But instead he charged us gratuity to make up for his fees. Most of the restaurants I have been to charge gratuity for 6 or more people. I just thought this was a bit unfair.On top of all that They sent me a personal message about my review.",

I look past how spicy the food is, even on their mild flavor. The taste is so flavorful for every bite. I love that they have a large option for people who do not want strictly Indian food either.",

I have learned much about the foods of a different culture. I have learned that I like most of it immensely. All those delicious foods! I tried new things and never found a thing I didn't like - just some I liked more than others. You better like curry and you better be able to handle spices, because some items may surprise you. Must GO !!",

Our waiter was able to describe all the dishes we were considering to us and took the time to understand what amount of spice we were looking for. I ordered the lamb chops which were unbelievable. I also tried all the curries and each one was delicious! We've tried a lot of other Indian restaurants around, but they all seemed to be very oily and left us with upset stomachs. This one is by far the best Indian we've had in the Columbia SC area! The inside is very welcoming and clean and everyone who works there is very nice. Definitely recommend!",

And have to leave by 1:45pm.  I ordered :  Fish bites: small pieces of fish fried. The smell didn't sit well with nor, nor taste wasn't very pleasing. Very strong fish smell. I barely took a bite and couldn't even finish that.  The chicken Tikka Marsala. A must have in many Indian restaurants. However, it's sweeter than my memory of it. It's no longer savory for me. The color of the curry was off. Maybe it's a different version than I'm usual. Didn't care for that either.  Naan is on point. Came out warm and it's cool perfectly..  our server: Brooke is ok. She seem over whelmed so we have to get her attention, like water need to be fill.   Overall I'm not impressed.. Service was too slow for lunch time. Seem to be understaffed and food is mediocre!",

We had Chicken Manchurian and Samosas for apps - chicken was spicy and a huge serving. Samosas were 3 to an order and also very good.  My husband ordered the Chicken Vindaloo which was very spicy and very good!  I had the chicken Tikka Masala at a level medium which had great flavor and still good spice.  The Taj Mahal beer special was good for 3.50 and I had a house cab.  We will definitely return to try other items and/or get takeout.  Service wasn't great and could be more attentive - it took a while for us to be greeted and taken care of once seated.",

    "text": "First time for wife and I.  A-OK.  Will take another trip or to entertain fan level.  I remember being told long ago that you will not find an Asian-Indian restaurant unless the owner can be assured that 50% of the business will be Indian.  Am guessing that is why you do not find Indian restaurants unless it is in a prosperous area.  Ummmm...  Part of a very large shopping center on Carolina Place Drive, so you have to look for it, located deep down on the right hand side.  You enter into a cavernous, very high ceiling room.  Other than a mural on the wall, it is pretty stark.  Booths and tables.  That said, on the other side of the restaurant is a nice, cozy-looking bar and more tables.  But we were there for dinner and the food.  Menu appears to be a bit sparse, but it is plenty.  Each section is divided into non-vegetarian and vegetarian.  Appetizers, non-veg ($10.99 - 14.99)  and veg ($6/99 - 9.99).    We had the Chicken Manchurian at $10.99 and the portion was HUGE.  Made me worry about ordering an entree!  Very good and pretty spicy.  I would give it a high 3 out of 5; but they use a one pepper, two pepper three pepper (and die) scale.  Ask your wait person.  We had Cory and he was great. Finally there WAS a guy who knew everything and it was Cory.  He know each dish and the beers.  A handy fellow to have around.  Indians are great Lager Beer brewers so I like to get their 22 oz bottles which are perfect for two people.  Old Monk at $7.99 was good, a lager, but had a bit of a sour taste to it...like home brew.  We shifted to another Indian Lager, Power Cool for our entree and that was a True, malty, no after taste lager at the same price.  There is a good range of entrees, including biryani rice dishes and they do have a tandoori oven, so you can get the common chicken tikka masala and other baked items.    Entree we chose and enjoyed, was the Methi Chicken ($14.99), which we were attracted to because it was cooked with fenugreek leaves.  If you have not tried that herb, give it a go.  Much different than the standard cumin & cardamom flavors you are used to with Indian curries.  Savory.  This also was a solid 3 of 5 in heat.    Rice is meted out sparsely, with each course coming with about a cup of rice.  Fortunately, you can get more so you can soak up the delicious sauces.  They also have a variety of naan breads.  Some whole wheat.  Plain, garlic, onion and butter varieties.  However, you have not lived until you try the chili garlic naan ($2.99).  This will light your fire in a delightful way.  You will find that you can enjoy the heat of this naan by cutting it with the three level sauces.  This naan is the best I have had, to include eating in India.   The bill was right at $49, which seems high for two dishes, bread and beer; but this is an Indian restaurant which earns a return visit.  Maybe we will see you there?",

I'm going to get fat and go broke spending all of my time and money licking the plates. :) Haven't tried anything that wasn't amazing and hopeful to try it all over time. Classics like Tikki Masala and Lamb Sagwala... tender and perfectly spiced and SO HEAVENLY CREAMY. The curries are great too. My husband is a big curry guy and he was very smiley with the Chicken Kadhai. Be ready to drink more water than you usually do in a week! I rarely overeat but I just cannot stop when I am at Persis.   GLUTEN FREE!! Tons upon tons of options here! They have the menu wonderfully labeled so you know what is gluten free. That was fantastic and made me even more excited to go back often. I did not have any upset tummy after eating at Persis which shows the quality of their preparation and spicing!  Atmosphere is casual but nice. Beautiful cocktail bar. Business attire to athleisure would feel very comfortable at Persis.   Waitstaff is kind, helpful and patient as making a choice (I can't have it all?!) is nearly impossible. Thank you Persis for making such good food!!",

I went early on a Saturday it was quiet still, very clean, nice set up and nice bar area. The staff were all great. The reason for the 3 stars is i wasn't super pressed with my food and the wine they have is very limited to two cheap house brands. This place has the potential to be upscale. I ordered Sonoma's while i waited. They took a while and when i got them they were good but it was apparent they sat in the fryer for a while. I always check my to go food , good thing as i ordered lamb sagwalla, naan and Raita . There was no Raita in the bag and no rice. I was quickly given both after mentioning it. I got home the naan was thin and slightly burnt and the Sagwalla was the greenest thing i have ever since ( i have had a LOT of different curries and India in cuisine) i will go back as it wasn't awful but i will get something different and let's hope i don't become radioactive from this Saagwalla lol ..  Visit number 2 - BLEW IT OUT THE WATER... had the chicken korma for me , lamb sagwala for my guy, garlic naan and simosas.. picked it up after work was fresh and amazing and we each had enough for two meals . So happy this place is so close to home ... we will be back for sure.",

The first order of Garlic Naan was burned and cold so I sent it back. The kitchen manager came back out with it and told me that's how it is because it's made in a clay oven. But I told him to turn it over and see if that is something that he would eat. The second batch was perfect. The chicken was seasoned perfectly. I asked for native Indian spicy  and they delivered. Now this isn't a tongue number. This is a fully body experience that will leave you tingling at the end. It was so hot that it brought tears to my eyes. They do have chutney but you have to ask for it.  Good to know for next time. I had a pleasant experience but this place looks like they took over a sports bar and hung some Indian wallpaper up. But the food was great and while you can't eat the decor I just hate sports bars.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying that I generally refuse to eat Indian food--the spices and spiciness are often too much for me to handle. Now, that said, we came to Persis on a Sunday evening (~7:00). The restaurant was surprisingly empty, especially considering it was a weekend (and I've seen them draw larger crowds on a weeknight). We were seated immediately.  We ordered the samosas to start--I found one order to be sufficient for three adults. I found them to be satisfying, though my aversion to Indian cuisine means I've never tasted samosas elsewhere and thus have nothing to compare these to. At this point, let me note that the samosas on the menu do not look like the samosas we were served; I'm not sure if this is a trend across the menu, and I obviously cannot know to what degree this affects the taste, but it's nonetheless worth the mention.  Entrees here are quite large, so we ordered two--the chicken tikka masala and the lamb korma--for the three of us. When it comes to the chicken, again, I enjoyed it a bit (the sauce was the highlight), but I have nothing to compare it to.  The same is the case with the lamb--nothing to compare to--but this was the dish I tried the first time I came here, and it's what brought me back here for a second visit. The lamb korma is nothing short of incredible! Talk about a standout dish. I can't decide what was better: the lamb or the sauce its sits in. This is a dish that stands out--not just for Indian food--but for food in general. I cannot recommend it enough.  As for the service, nothing noteworthy to note here.",

My comments: food is delicious/really good with a very dynamic spice profile. I recommend Chicken 65 app, Tikka Masala app, chicken vindaloo entree and chicken biryani. Their biryani is very nice and includes an egg. My only concerns with this place are the usual growing pains with a new restaurant so I am not reducing my stars at this point - namely, service is very slow and disorganized, staff is untrained and a bit rough around the edges. Also, prices are on the high end and there is no lunch menu at this point. To summarize: 1) great food; 2) higher prices; and, 3) slow and confused service..I will be back because the #1 is the most important for me.",

The sauce was sooooo good but the chicken was dry. Chef - please stop overcooking the chicken. It should be succulent.",

The menu had several options but was not at all overwhelming and the food was absolutely delicious. Service was good, timing could have been better, although they are very new and it was a busy Friday night, so there is that to consider. My husband joked we should return today for another, what is sure to be, tasty meal!!",

The chef has no clue what indian food is about it lacks spices which are the backbone of indian food. Naan were ok masala chicken was disappointing.korma was ok and tandoori roti was disappointing. Overall the food was disappointing only thing i liked tandoori chicken even that was so so.",

The Naan is really wonderful, especially the Garlic Naan. The methi chicken, however, was a disappointment.  It smelled wonderful, but it lacked the cream in the sauce. It was also spicier than I would have liked. I will certainly be back, but I wont order the methi chicken here again. I'll go to Ballantyne for that.",

Everything we had, from the samosa, korma and vindaloo was on the bland side. It would be ok for someone first trying Indian cuisine, but it could be kicked up a notch. The presentation is great and the atmosphere is nice, I like how you are not sitting at the table next to you.  There is plenty of open space to maneuver.",
