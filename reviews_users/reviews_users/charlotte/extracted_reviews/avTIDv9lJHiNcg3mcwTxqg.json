Got the Cobb Salad and it was about half the size it used to be.  Maybe an ounce of chicken, a quarter of boiled egg and two little slices of avocado and not even enough dressing to cover the little salad.  Got the Chicken Picatta and the Chicken Breast were tiny.  Where do they get the baby chicks.  The rolls were like rocks, I guess left over from lunch.  All in all, disappointed.  I expected more as we used to get in the past.  And the prices keep going up which is OK if quality and volume remains the same.  Thanks",

I say pleasantly surprised for a couple of reasons. 1) The decor is very outdated. Going off of looks, this might not be your first choice. 2) Food at the shower I hosted a couple of months ago was tasty, but it just sandwiches and salad. So I was a little skeptical for brunch items.   I ordered the Shrimp and Grits and a Mimosa from the brunch menu. First, the Mimosa was a nice addition to the meal, but tasted more like Orange Juice. Now, my Shrimp and Grits were good, but the quantity was disappointing. My side items were Collard Greens and a Sausage Wrap of some sort. Most of my plate was Collard Greens. However, this was why the meal was a pleasant surprise, as the Collard Greens were seasoned excellently. I was just wanting more Shrimp and Grits.   Also, SN:  the brunch menu says assorted muffins and bread. Those were quite disappointing, as they were very small and tasted very similar to what I could get from a Sam's Club or Wal-Mart.",

    "text": "I think I have woosah'ed enough over the past few days that I can write a relatively (that's subjective) coherent review of this place.  I don't think I have been to Trio since it first opened many years ago (mid 90's?).  From my memory, it is still decorated pretty much the same based on the low benches at the pizza bar that are teal.  But that's fine - as long as the seats are comfy, I don't care what color they are.  I was greeted by a friendly hostess and seated at a comfy booth. Most of the other diners were 50+, again, nothing wrong with that, but on a Monday evening, it was an older crowd.  My waitress was friendly enough but I was waiting on her quite a bit.  I was afraid to drink all of my water, as I didn't think I would be getting a refill.  I was not a fan of the service, I was in there for over an hour and all I ordered was a sandwich and a piece of pie.  But slowness isn't the worst of the waitress traits (I will get to that...)  The food: Roasted Beef Tenderloin sandwich with fries ($10) - (pictured) The first bite was delicious with a bite of soft bread, grilled onions, crispy onions, pepper jack cheese, herbed mayo and tender, well-flavored beef.  The second bite was stringy steak.  The third bite the meat was a little tougher.  Overall it wasn't a bad sandwich at all.  Pretty well balanced, although maybe a little spicier than I would have liked for a tenderloin sandwich.  The fries were fine, standard fries, nothing special, and served with a tiny cup of ketchup that was enough for exactly half of the fries.  Had I seen my waitress before I was almost done eating, I would have asked for more.  3/5 Chocolate Silk Pie ($4) - The description said it was a creamy white and dark chocolate mousse on Oreo cookie crust.  Drizzled with chocolate and I think raspberry sauce, along with some fresh strawberry slices scattered about, it was mostly frozen.  It reminded me of a Carvel ice cream cake.  It wasn't bad, well-presented, but wasn't what I was expecting. 2.5/5  Nothing was bad, but nothing was spectacular, however everything seemed to be reasonably priced and included crab cakes and scallops, which my mother loves, so I would have made a return trip toting her along.  Until...  I was seated just on the other side of the pizza bar and heard a waitress tell an offensive joke to the pizza chef.  I have a mouth like a sailor, and I am pretty hard to offend, but her \"joke\" turned my stomach.  And this was not a teenager, this was a girl who was easily in her mid to late 20's and should have more class and better home training than to repeat something so tasteless - it wasn't funny, it was ignorant, but when you are on company time it is a negative reflection of not only you, but your employer.  If you are going to act like trash, at least lower your voice or do it off of the floor.  I asked to speak to the manager, who did apologize and acted as if she would at least speak to the woman.  I was disgusted.    Never again.",

My wife's steak was very bland, tender, but not flavorful at all. The waiter asked how her steak was and she replied, \"it's OK.\" He said, \"OK? Just OK?\" Trying to drag it out of her, so she told him that it was bland. He apologized and asked if she wanted him to take it back. She said no, we got our check, and left.

I've been here on an off in the past several years but only learning again to appreciate their food.    We started coming here for lunch for a change from the usual options.  The place gets busy so if you hit it around lunchtime, your best option may be to wait until after 12:45 when it clears out a little.    The menu is very diverse and includes pizza, salads, sandwiches and various entrees.  I typically order something healthy here and love, love, love their Southwestern Salmon salad. which comes with a salmon filet over a bed of romaine, jicama, corn, peppers and a couple of other ingredients with a spicy vinagrette dressing.  Very tasty.  Service is usually good here.  Host and Hostess are very friendly.  And the layout of the is restaurant is very unique.  There's a pizza counter in the back where you can sit and watch them make pizzas, there's a bar in the back.,  Everything is broken into about 3 cascading levels.  The lowest level is typically used for larger groups.   Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots.  One day I may have to check it out for dinner.",

Our waitress Stacy was great, obviously really proud to work at this long standing restaurant that makes a lot of their food right there.  I knocked off one star because they did not have any vegan dinner dishes besides salads that could be modified so I ordered the vegetarian pizza.  It was delicious.  My husband enjoyed his seafood dish too.  We will be back one day soon for dessert!",

I'm fine waiting 10-15 for a table but waiting an additional 15-20 for a waiter to notice us is frustrating to say the least, especially on an empty stomach. After a few failed attempts to get someone's attention we decided to leave and go across the street to chili's where we were really taken care of. Bummed I didn't eat at Trio but for me good service is a big deal when I go out to eat.",

We had the calamari to start and for the entrees we chose the smoked chicken penne pasta and filet mignon. Everything was incredible (like lick the plate kind of good). Since it was Monday they had a special that if you spent over $30 as a couple you get a free dessert. I love desserts, so I was very excited! We got the baked Alaska and let me tell you.... Insanely decadent it was delicious. And to top it off Matt, our server, was so nice and went above and beyond to make our meal one to remember. We will definitely be back! Thanks Trio for an incredible dinner!",

Not only was the customer service excellent (with less than a weeks notice by the way) but the presentation and quality of the the food was amazing! I was so nervous (as I had not eaten at Trio previously and didn't know the quality of their food) but they pleasantly surprised me! There was plenty of food for all 25 of my guests! You can't beat the price of a brunch done by Trio. My menu included: Grits, bacon, eggs, and a beautiful fruit tray with pineapple, melon, strawberries, and cantaloupe. It was great! My guests commented on how tasty everything was. They even supplied, cups, cutlery, and plastic plates. Everything looked perfect! I was VERY pleased! Thank you Trio for making my brunch so seamless and easy for me. We will be back for sure!",

The delivery was for 25 people (an array of pastas and salad, drinks)  they arrived with 8(eight) breadsticks, no drinks.  By the time the driver (Dan, the manager) arrived with breadstick and drinks everyone had eaten lunch.  I can't even begin to tell you how unimpressed I felt when I discussed this poor service with Dan (this individual who represented himself as management) and he responded  with \"people make mistakes\" and \"there's nothing I can do about that now\".   Yes, the  food was good but I now have plenty of breadsticks and drinks because it all arrived after lunch.  Oh, did I mention I already paid for this?  Dan, just in case you haven't learned this key management rule--unsatisfied customers don't come back.  If you want to stay in business you need to bring your 'A' game.",

As an entree my absolute favorite is the sea bass at around $16 it is a great value and is an amazing meal!

The almond basket dessert is so good I can't eat it slowly in fear that my share-mates will get all the good parts!!! We love trio and are happy it's in the neighborhood!",

What they do, they do quite well. The pizza is good and the brunch is a bit of a diamond in the rough. But, the condition of the main dining room simply cannot be glossed over and the 3 stars I am giving Trio might be too generous in this context. The decor is \"Early 90s Dentist Office\", but that's not the problem. The issue is the carpet, which might need to be carbon dated if we'd like to know its real age. The mildewy, moldy smell coming from it permeates the restaurant and is extremely unpleasant. This place needs some serious investment if it is to be anything but take out only.",

The service was good- if I had to guess, I would guess that many of the servers have been with this restaurant for a long time.  All of the staff were friendly with my 1 year old, even when part of his meal was on the floor. Huge selling point for me.  Halfway through the meal, we noticed the air vents in the ceiling.  They are disgusting and discolored- in serious need of being repainted.",

There was a turkey burger they I loved but it has been discontinued. I was bummed about that. This weekend we went and I tried a monthly special. I was extremely disappointed. It was chicken pot pie, it came out room so I asked them to heat it up, when it came back, I tried it and it honestly tasted and looked like a can of progressive chicken pot pie soup with canned chickens pieces and all. The puff pastry they put on top was good. The creme brulee was okay when it's normally out of this world. The waitress was okay, she was better than the last one we had. I truly hope the next time I go, it's like the Trio's that it used to be and I want to keep going back.",

Staff is great and on point,  i have never had a bad experience here and let me tell you a little secret,  the ice tea, french onion soup and club sandwich are the magic cure for a hangover!!",

I'm a southern girl who loves her own mashed sweet potatoes but I think they have me beat. I figured I might as well wrap up this time warp dream come True with a baked Alaska and was in heaven. Sadie was a pleasure to work with and was honest about her recommendations which I greatly appreciated.  If you're ever near Trio's- give them a try.

And it's quiet enough and tables are spaced out enough to where you can have a conversation.   I had the Mediterranean shrimp and scallops with pesto orzo. While the shrimp were tasty, the flavor of the orzo was the star. It was creamy and savory with just the right amount of sun-dried tomatoes and olives. Oh and the food comes out fast.  Dessert is my favorite. The mocha pecan ice cream is amazing and this is the only restaurant that serves it. We tried to get a server to track it down for us, but It's a special flavor made only for Trio. This time I had it in the almond basket which was beautiful in presentation, but I enjoy it more on a brownie.   This is a good place for a relaxing dinner with great service.",

We got spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer- yummy! We got desserts as well. The servers were friendly and our entrees came quickly. Things went a little downhill after we got our entrees- we had to ask for drink refills and the desserts took a long time to come out. Our friends made a reservation requesting the main dining room, and we were seated elsewhere, which was a little cramped. That won't stop us from dining at Trio again.

As someone who hates sweet potatoes, I was dismayed during Queen's Feast (Jan 2018) when my filet mignon arrived with a massive mound of mashed/whipped sweet potatoes, until I tasted them. I wouldn't have thought to put a filet with sweet potatoes, but it worked extremely well. They are still the only sweet potatoes I like.   On another occasion, I had their lobster ravioli, which was good but a little too rich and had some shell in one of the raviolis.   Service is always good, and the waitstaff looks busy but does a great job.",

Today we went in for another fabulous meal and our server, Casey, remembered what we usually ordered for lunch and dessert!   It had been quite  a while since we had been in and we were just amazed that she would remember us and what we liked!  Not only do we highly recommend Trio for lunch, dinner, and week end brunch, but we suggest asking for Casey if possible!   All of the servers are excellent, and have always been very helpful and efficient .  They have also added a wonderful outdoor room with high ceilings, sky lights, fans and screens - no rain or bugs to spoil a lovely meal in the fresh air!  Just another reason this is one of our favorites!",

I've been to this restaurant a good number of times in the past decade or so...and from their menu, this dessert always tops the list as their best...to me, at least!  On a down note, I've had some service issues in the past year, so not sure if I'd highly recommend the restaurant in general. Even today, I stood by the hostess stand for at least 3 minutes before near flagging someone to escort me to a table. Given that I arrived outside of their prime lunch or dinner hours, guess it's understandable...but there always seems to be one issue or another as of late.  Still, they DO have this heavenly dessert...so I can't rate them less than 4 stars.",

It's nothing fancy, totally old school. You'll see tables of families and friends here who have obviously been coming here for years.   I come here for one thing and one thing only: the cobb salad. Seriously, I crave it all the time. There have been days where I've strategically planned meetings or errands just so I can come get this damn salad. It's your normal cobb- mixed greens, chicken, shredded cheddar, smoked bleu cheese, bacon, avocado, scallions, egg, and tomato. But here's what sets it a part and totally makes the salad: the \"Killer\" dressing. I don't know what it is or what it contains but it is absolutely delicious.   Pro tip #1: get a side of \"Killer\" dressing so you can dip your roll in it (you're welcome for that).  Pro tip #2: like I said, this place is always busy. Skip the wait for a table and go sit at the bar. I've never had a bad experience here, service is always great.",

First, I want to shout out ALEXIS, GARY, AND THE JENNIFER'S. The staff was beyond fantastic both planning the event and running the event while my team was there.  Alexis and Gary helped me understand what was possible from a venue and menu standpoint a couple weeks before our planned event and got it nailed down to give them enough time to make it all happen at the restaurant.They were also able to reserve a large space for us in the back that accommodated us perfectly.  The two servers, Jennifer and Jennifer, were also fantastic. We had a larger group - around 30 people - so there were requests flying out from all over the place. They did a great job of making sure all orders were taken and then quickly filled!  We ordered a ton of different food - salads, sandwiches, pizzas, calamari, chicken tenders - and it was all DELICIOUS. It's one thing to make your food taste good, it's another thing to make sure a lot of food tastes good and is FRESH. You could tell all of the food they brought out was just made. I really appreciate that kind of planning on their part to make sure the food was as fresh as possible. That is definitely not the case in a lot of places.   Overall, I would 100% recommend Trio if a regular dining experience is as good as their event experience. The food is great and the service is even better.",

Their location is large and they offer an extensive menu, from Soups, Salads, Pizza, Pasta and some speciality items each month.  My most recent visit was with my Dinner Group, which included 8 people and we had reservations.  We were seated in a nice private area and had a great server.  Ironically it was a Tuesday night and the place was packed. With that said, having 8 people there was definitely a variety in the food ordered.  We started with soup and some appetizers, in particular the French Onion and Trio Dip.  The French Onion was a hit, but the Dip Trio wasn't anything to write home about.  And, unfortunately they had just ran out of Romaine Lettuce so there salad selections were limited.  How does a restaurant run out of Romaine at 7:30pm on a Tuesday...anyway.  As for the entrees, we enjoyed a variety of items and from what everyone said they liked their dishes. I had the Chicken and Shrimp and thought it was fine. Everything to mean seemed good, but no one faved about anything and said this is a must return restaurant. We finished our meal with dessert and I can say that was sure the highlight. I loved my brownie and ice cream, and others enjoyed their treats.  On a side note, there cocktail menu and wine isn't anything great!",

This place offers a ribeye which just happens to be my favorite cut of meat, that just looked and sounded great.  Decision made!  And it was well worth it!  The calamari was sweet and slightly spicy,  and probably top 3 I've had.  The ribeye was very good too.  Came out cooked to my request and was just delish with nice marbling throughout.   The family enjoyed their meals as well which included a flavorful chicken piccata, pizza and a free apple fritter with cinnamon ice cream.  What a great meal!

I tried the fried cheese ravioli special. It was OK. The ravioli mostly filled with air and was short on filling.  Service: Poor. While our waitress was friendly, she was not attentive. I never got offered another beer (they lost a sale) and my water was never refilled. I.e., after our initial service, our server was scarce, except to bring with the check.

The meat in the pie was excellent but I had to salt the top to give it flavor. I never use salt for most of my meals. The scallops were gritty and the risotto dish didn't have a lot of flavor.

It was good, the only problem was it was not hot. I guess it had been sitting for a while and was literally room temp. Had it been hot, it would have been better.  I had the chicken and shrimp . Small piece of chicken and tiny shrimp for $15-16.  I can appreciate it comes with two sides. Chicken was ok needed a pinch of salt.  Broccoli came out with a small piece of plastic wrap(just a small oversight).  Sweet potatoes where not good to me, but it is a personal preference for how like mine.. This dish did not impress me at all.   We also had kids cheese pizza.  It was ok for my little one.  Hubby had beef medallion sandwich.  It was alright nothing amazing.

After experiencing delicious menu items, I was left in awe finding out Trio opened back in January of 1992!  The atmosphere is comparable to visiting a local dining area in Hilton Head Island, SC. Pictured below is what I indulged in. The buttermilk fried chicken was extremely juicy and flavorful and the Belgium waffles were out of this world scrumptious!  At the introduction of this post I mentioned having a meeting at this Gem. My business partner and I were privileged to have met one of Trio's managers. Emma is extremely friendly and even agreed for us to utilize the patio for an upcoming project we are collaborating on  (stay tuned)  My business partner indulged in the deliciousness pictured below. She offered me some of her french toast and melted in my mouth is an understatement. The toast was soft and creamy fused with sweetness from the fresh strawberries.

    "text": "This was a fun treat. I was invited here by a colleague who works in this area. I was in town on business, and we enjoyed a lunch there.  They serve a variety of artisanal creations based on basic American foods.  For example, they added a nice kick of tarragon to my tuna sandwich (which the graciously switched to a wrap at my request).  It was a very hot day, or I would have been tempted to try the soups. Several people had them and they smelled delicious, but I simply couldn't manage with 90+ degree weather afoot.    They also served some salads to our table, which looked delightful, and the server was very thoughtful about how he presented the options and the finished food upon arrival.    I was mostly impressed that a man who was walking around cleaning tables, and being generally polite, was later identified by my lunch-mate as the owner of the restaurant.  I highly recommend this place.",

The menu had some good options that we definitely want to come back and try more items!",

Love the sweet potato home made chips with blue cheese. Service is always perfect an food delish. They have a house dressing you must try Killer Dressing yes that's it's name . I can't explain its a light creamy dressing they make great on their salads. My dad loves their meat loaf, a great place for brunch as well. Their deserts are to die for my favorite when they have it is baked Alaska so good an they have an almond basket it's a basket made out of crushed almonds an molded into a basket an served with a coffee ice cream inside with fresh berries. It's a must have especially for your bday. I will always go back great hidden treasure in Pineville .  Update; I have to say the past 3 times Ive been my order has been wrong an we have had a server that attends to her regulars not so much her other tables. There rolls are all the sudden an issue . Ive been going to Trios for years never an issue.  When you order a salad Ive always gotten a roll or Ive asked a server an they bring me one with the whipped butter.  Ive asked at one of my visit an the server gave me some speech they dont give them to everyone blah blah . She finally brought us all one . I was there this week an the server I had several months ago we had her again so my order was wrong again an my friends salad which is all she got barely had any dressing.  Our server who was also the bartender was waiting on her  regulars didn't come back another server or mgr came over finally. Again I asked for a roll an because I had pizza an half salad it doesn't come with it SMH its gonna be some time before I go back . Its not MCdonalds or BK  not cheap so I expect good service an my order right.  If rolls are expensive for them than they need to start stating that on their menu.  I can go right up the road to metro diner service is awesome an food never an issue there if Im asking for something.  Good luck trios",

I went back in the 90's and little has changed (that's a good thing bc the food is very good, prices are reasonable, etc) This last time was hampered by a server who seriously refused to even acknowledge half of our table.  One person in our party Never interacted with our server.  He kept having to flag down someone passing by for a drink order, dinner order, and 1 refill of tea...It was almost comical. I ordered dessert and she didn't even bother to look to see if he wanted anything, just took the order and ran.    It's funny bc we go out to eat everywhere and we are always treated well and are the easiest going group ever.  We have both been in the service industry for over 10 yrs and we make it a point to be nice/easy/friendly to everyone when we go out, so this was just a complete shock.    Still, it's a shame when a good place is held back by bad service.",

The MULLIGATAWNY Soup is  fabulous, thick with chicken chunks, carrot and potato in a creamy, lightly seasoned  curry base.  It is their Signature Soup!   GRILLED LEMON PEPPER SALMON with creamed cauliflower and roasted asparagus is my favorite meal. Trio is very good about taking substitutions to suit your dietary needs. The salads are fresh and colorful, with wonderful dressings to choose from. There is outdoor seating, booth seating, open area table seating and a room for large groups to reserve.  Individual Pizzas from the Stone Oven are fresh and you can watch from a seating bar in front of the oven. We like their Meatloaf dinner with 2 sides that can be switched if you prefer another choice. The front of the menu always has Specials of the season. So when it was Lobster season I tried their Lobster Salad with asparagus - it was Huge! and delicious! Almond Basket with Trio Mocha Ice Cream is another favorite dessert. There are lots of healthy fresh options at Trio, combined with a very friendly Staff, makes this my favorite Charlotte restaurant!  All restaurants have an occasional error when they are serving at peak times. My advise to customers that have an unhappy experience at Any restaurant is to speak up and ask for a manager to help you out. Everyone makes mistakes  now and then --- and I know that at Trio, they bend over backward to Make It Right! This is our favorite restaurant as they have been consistently superior for 20 years.",

I recently hosted a holiday brunch and took a chance with Trio catering as I had never been to the restaurant.  I ordered the breakfast options catering package and I have to say it was AMAZING!!  First, the process in working with the catering manager, Dave Robinson was very smooth!  He was very helpful in answering all of my questions in regards to the catering process at Trio and what I could expect; trust me, I had a lot of questions!   On the day of setup (which was a Sunday) he was very organized, brought all of the materials and showed up right on time!  In working with other caterers, I am not always so lucky, but this was great. Everything was amazing, but the quiche, French toast and potatoes were great!  The Trio catering packages is very reasonable price-wise and the food is so delicious!  I have to say I gave many referrals at the event and hope to make this an annual brunch event thanks to Trio and the delicious food and service!",

    "text": "This is a bit of an odd one because the ambiance and decor don't match the food that we had.  We went for Restaurant Week and the $30 prix fixe for 2 ended up at $95 with the addition of 2 beers and a glass of wine, plus tip.  The food was actually very good and the presentation was very good, too.  My steak wasn't high-end steakhouse caliber, yet it was a good piece of meat.  Portions were somewhat modest, but reasonable for a classy meal.    Now for the rest...  The main area, where we sat, has a very high (2-story) ceiling, with plenty of light.  Great, so far.  There is another eating area and a bar that have standard ceiling height.  There are two types of seating.  One is square tables, with white table clothes, and the other is padded benches with outdated mauve tables.  Very Denny-ish or like a local diner.  They benches were in great shape, but the tables were a little worn around the edges.  The table was stocked with a plain salt-and-pepper set and a plain sugar holder.  The floor was carpeted, which I only mention because, unless carpeting looks very clean, I view it as a breeding ground for bacteria.  Not that it was, just worries me.  Our main waiter was very good.  Professional and efficient.  The drink waitress seemed more appropriate for a country diner in appearance, demeanor, and dress.  The crowd was on the older side (not that there's anything wrong with that, plus I ain't a youngster), which may have been because of the early time we went.  That's about it.  If the seating area got a makeover, I'd say this place could be called a moderately high-end restaurant.  Then again, if I'd eaten one of the more down home choices, and/or paid just a bit less, it probably would have all come together for me.  I'd go back for a $30-40 meal, but if I'm paying $100, I'll be  going elsewhere.",

    "text": "We ate dinner here yesterday and I can honestly say it was one of the better experiences I've had at a restaurant in a while.  The server was attentive and friendly (which for some reason is getting rather rare!) and the food was very tasty!  The salmon was cooked to perfection, while my husband was pleased with his meatloaf, even though he wished there had been MORE of it.  We'll definitely go back sometime.  It's just too yummy to pass up!  Now, the cons.  They are so tiny I almost blush bringing them up.  But here they are, just the same:  The ambiance:  the restaurant hasn't been updated in quite some time, I'd wager since it was first built.  Where we sat there were signs of touch-up paint in places where the paint had peeled, but no complete renovation.  And the neon really has to go.  I felt like I was eating in a restaurant where I could expect Crockett or Tubbs to walk through the door at any moment!  Kind of weird!  Tiny touches, like the aioli on our crab cakes, were obviously phoned in.  It was basically just mayonnaise with a little more lemon juice mixed in.  But I'm a little picky where the finishing touches are concerned, so it might have just been me.  Other than those two little nit-picky items, I'd happily dine here again and again!",

Nothing to write hope about but good.  They brought out dishes off assortment muffins before your meal and wow.  These little lemon poppy seed warm muffins were great! I don't know if they were homemade or not but they tasted great!  Hopefully I will be able to get back here and try more of the menu.",

I have been coming here for 20 years and reviewing someplace poorly because of a bad joke you heard is very ignorant. I get the Three Cheese Tortellini, Mulligatawny soup YUM!, and the Almond basket for dessert but with cinnamon ice cream. I really don't know how you can go wrong, they have great chefs that cook a lot of things from scratch, get the specials they are worth it usually. Apple pear vinaigrette is a winner too.",

    "text": "My husband and I had dinner at Trio for the first time last Saturday night.  The mixed reviews had me a bit apprehensive...but we were very pleasantly surprised with our experience.  We were seated very quickly and were greeted by Matt, our server.  We ordered wine and an appetizer...the Wood Fired Pesto Bread...which I never expected to be one of the best appetizers I have ever eaten.  Seriously...fantastic!  Next my husband ordered the Mediterranean Shrimp and Scallops which he described as \"so good I considered licking the plate\".  I had the Grilled Ribeye with roasted vegetable medley, whipped potatoes, and shallot herb butter.  Again, it was perfectly cooked, tender, and very flavorful.  We were offered dessert...but were so stuffed from the great meal we declined.  Matt was a wonderful server...funny, very attentive without hovering, and knowledgeable about the menu.  We look forward to our next trip to Trio and another fantastic experience!",

    "text": "This is another restaurant I tend to eat at solely with my parents.  That's not really a bad thing; it's just not typically a place I would seek out on my own.  Trio certainly has a few things going for it.  First, it's fairly large, and even with groups of five or six, I've never had to wait for a table.  Second, even though the decor is decidedly dated, I kind of love it... the interior is decorated primarily in teal, which is great, and the whole dining room has a light, airy feeling about it.  As for the food, I've had their pizzas and pastas and maybe a salad or two, and I've never had a bad meal.  Granted, my mind has never been blown either, but I can at least appreciate a place that has more than one or two options that aren't loaded up with beef.  Let's put it this way: I don't know that I would pay for this food myself, but it's a perfectly adequate place to be taken out to dinner.",

    "text": "No way will I be back any time soon. My husband and I went here for restaurant week and we were very disappointed with everything. I was able to make a reservation easily at the last minute and I was glad I we did. The line was endless and crowded.   We get seated and our waiter takes around 10 minutes for him to take our drink orders. Through dinner, he kept giving me my husband's drink, and his mine and our drinks were empty most of our dinner. We place our appetizer order in and ask if the baby's food can be brought out 1st. My husband orders the calamari and I ordered the lobster bisque. TWENTY FIVE MINUTES LATER (not exaggerating) we get the baby's food and our appetizers. The calamari was very good, but the lobster bisque could have used some cheese and salt. I wasn't all that impressed with it.  While we are eating our appetizers, our salads come. Both of us ordered the cesar salad and it was the worst salad I had in a while. The salad dressing was very heavy on the anchovies and had a nasty taste to it. The croutons were homemade, yet extremely stale and chewy (if that's possible). It was so nasty, we didn't finish our salads.  15 minutes after we FINISH our salads, the main course arrives on piping hot plates and placed IN FRONT of my infant daughter so she can burn herself. I ordered the Mediterranean seafood dish that had scallops, shrimp, lobster pieces, kalmata (sorry for the spelling) olive pieces, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, feta cheese, and risotto. I was very surprised to find out that my dish was actually really good. The flavors from the olives, the dressing that was put on it, and the seafood blended in really well. My husband ordered the filet minon medium rare, mashed potatoes, and zucchini medley. The filet minon was cooked medium with a very poor attempt of a holiendase sauce on top of the steak, it was tough to cut through, and the zucchini was not cooked all the way through. My husband was very dissapointed in the steak and regretted eating it.  Dessert was a joke. I ordered creme brulee and my husband had their almond basket with ice cream. My dessert was not cooked all the way through and the strawberries that was served with it were very sour. It also came with banana bread muffins, but I was so fed up with my meal at that point I didn't bother with them. My husband had a little better luck with his than I did. The ice cream and sauce on the bottom of the dessert were alright, but the \"basket\" had sesame seeds on it and it completely threw off the taste.   We get our bill and come to find out it's $81. I scan through the bill and come to find out my daughters kiddie drink was full price at $2.25, her meal was a full price meal instead of the kiddie price like we were told it was at $8 and her kiddie ice cream (that was 2 HUGE scoops of half melted ice cream) was $4.95. We bring this up to our waiter (which that was the fastest he moved the whole night) and he told us there was nothing he could do and shrugged it off. Since we got that response, it was no use in complaining about our meals at all since we were going to get a nose snubbed at.   In general, we had a terrible go at it and I would not recommend this to anyone.",
