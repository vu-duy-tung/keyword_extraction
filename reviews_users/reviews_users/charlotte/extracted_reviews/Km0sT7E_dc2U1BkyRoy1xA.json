The downside is that even with that special the rolls are still on the expensive side. Our waiter was very nice, but he was almost too helpful. He came over to the table to check on us a lot. I appreciated his desire to make sure we were happy, but in my opinion he was too involved (if both of our glasses of water are full, chances are we don't need more water).  If asked to go back again, I would. But I wouldn't make a special trip there.",

My favorite dish is the Deluxe Fried Rice - chewy and flavorful Chinese sausage, succulent shrimp, tasty chicken and a bit of eggs in a bed of beautifully fried rice.  Go to Akahana and definitely order the fried rice!  The decor is modern and warm with outdoor seating on warm days.  It's a great place to eat with friends or family.  Also good for business lunches and dinners.  Prices are also reasonable.  Most dishes are in the low teens.",

Didn't have any pleasantries, didn't know the menu, took my order incorrectly, gazed off into the distance while we were ordering and asking questions. Rather than acknowledge the error when she brought the wrong appetizer, she delivered the bill to me saying that there was an extra $2 charge for an item that was on the menu at the same price as what she brought to me incorrectly. She never came by to see how the appetizer was, and I tried to flag her down but she wouldn't even look in our direction. I eventually had to go  back into the restaurant and ask the hostess to ask the waitress to come back to my table. The staff seemed overwhelmed, from the time we arrived until we left. I even phoned for a reservation prior to going there, and this seemed to be too much for them to deal with. Eventually went in and sat on the patio with the young families. Not worth the trip, even though it's in a quaint part of town. Food was okay. I'm a tourist and will never recommend anyone to visit there.",

    "text": "We tried Akahana last night with another couple.  The food is outstanding, BUT one person was served, second dinner arrived about 10 minutes later, and the third, which my hubby and I shared, was at least 20 minutes after the first dinner was served. We ordered the Back Bean stir fry, which was delicious, but SO late in coming.  Our friend ordered the Mongolian Beef, which was so spicy he had a difficult time eating it.  (And he normally likes spicy food).  No mention on the menu about it being spicy at all.  The other person (first one served) had the Salmon, which was very good, but comes drenched in a Curry sauce.  No mention of that on the menu either. She would not have ordered it if she knew it was Curry.  So a word to the wise:  Check the ingredients with your server, ask a lot of questions, and be aware they are new and inexperienced.  We were there for 1 1/2 hours. Love their dumplings, and the wonton soup is delicious. Both were wrapped in a very light dough, perfect.  They need to get some Chinese Mustard, which we like to add to our soup. Don't quite know how many stars to give this brand new restaurant.  Delicious food, less than satisfactory dinner service. (NOT the waiter's fault, I blame it on the kitchen organization. Very, very noisy.  Nothing on the walls, floor or ceilings to absorb any sound, so little kids screaming is very noticeable. Also, the music is too loud. We will give them another chance.  They are certainly not pros at this restaurant thing.",

    "text": "When I walked in, I was impressed with the ambiance of the place.  It was nicely decorated and there were plenty of open tables inside and out.  It was around 7pm on a Wednesday night.  I was with my boyfriend on a date night so I was hoping for a table alone but we were seated almost directly next to a father and son.  We ordered our appetizer and my boyfriend ordered sake.  The crab Rangoon appetizer was delicious and we became hungrier as the time went on.  We ordered our food; I wanted sushi and they always have a buy one, get one free special and my boyfriend, not a sushi eater, got the sesame chicken.  After nearly an hour of waiting and watching people enter the restaurant and not leave it, we were becoming concerned about the wait time for our food.  My boyfriend's came out first (after about a 45 minute wait) and it WAS delicious.  He wanted to wait for me to get my sushi but I told him to go on because I didn't know how much longer it would be.  Almost a full twenty minutes more went by before we actually got our food.  We couldn't believe the wait!  I asked the waitress who was quite friendly if this was how it normally was and she said during the dinner rush, the sushi always gets behind.  This leads me to believe they need to hire another one or two sushi chefs because there's never a wait like that at other equally priced restaurants. When my sushi DID finally arrive, it was good.  It was rolled tightly and tasted delicious (I had the volcano roll  and the spicy tuna).  However, both my boyfriend and I were turned off by the wait.  The waitress said coming after the lunch rush but before the dinner rush would be the best time so I encourage you to try to go then if you're going to go.  I love the buy one get one free roll experience but I hated the wait.  We will probably go again but at the exact right time.",

    "text": "My wife and visited Akahana on a Friday night. When greeted at the door we were advised that the wait would be about 10 minutes. Not too bad for a Friday night during the dinner rush. We went to the bar to get a glass of wine. The service in the bar was a little slow and the staff seemed a little overwhelmed. It wasn't that busy in the bar so this might be an area they should look into improving.  When we were seated we exchanged pleasantries with our server, Gina, we advised her that I have gluten sensitivities. Gina was AWESOME! She made suggestions and steered us clear of things that may be a problem for me. The surprise to me was when she brought a bottle of gluten free soy sauce to our table without even being asked to do so. Her suggestion of a wine selection was spot on too.  The Pho that we had was incredible and again Gina helped us in our selection because we have never tried it. The sushi was tasty and fresh, we chose something we have had tons of times before and it was very good.  The wine was a big pour and for the price it was an above average deal.   Our overall experiance was awesome and we would recommend you visit.  Ask to sit in Gina's section if she is working and tell her you heard about it here.  The bar service was a little slow and the front door was slow to close causing cold air to rush in and flow over our table. But those are things that can be worked on. The food was great and the table service was outstanding and it was reasonably priced. A huge thank you to Gina and Akahana for a job extremely well done",

For exceptional service a 4 for sure. But the service was just so bad. We did have a party of 7, but it was not busy. I never got a soup I ordered, the waitress argued with a member of my party about an incorrect entree coming out, she was obviously highly irritated with us the whole meal. She was asked by another lady if they had virgin drinks from the bar and she cattily replied they had juice. The manager seemed to be apologetic about the service but in the same breath excusing her a bit because she had personal issues going on. He really didn't go out of his way to improve our current dinning experience just promised a better one next time around. She sure as heck tacked on her 18% tip too (policy for a group over 6), so I guess it didn't matter to her what we thought about the service. If I'm in the area again I might give it another shot but I never want to bring a big group here ever again.",

    "text": "Cuisine is Asian fusion. Interior theme fits the cuisine: small tea candles at each table and a full set of \"essentials\" with sriracha & hoisin sauces, salt & pepper, regular and less sodium soy sauce, and 2 small plates (the plates are not so essential and I usually ask for them to be removed). Noticed not all the chairs matched in the dining room.  Food tastes average-good. Pricing is fair, their $4.95 appetizer soups shocked me at first but then I found they are actually full bowls (and quite delicious), not the tiny cups you are served elsewhere.   Sushi is always BOGO (good deal for sushi) and the entree dishes are ~$12.00. Sundays have $3 mimosas and $4 bloody Marys.   Unfortunately service is why it's only worth 2 stars maximum because it all depends on your server. I eat here somewhat frequently and noticed a bit of turnover. There's 3 [memorable] servers I've seen since the opening that are still around and doing a great job. (Don't get me wrong, I'm not a sourpuss & always in a good mood to go eat!)   Other servers either seem new to the industry or just not suited for the role with an apparent negative attitude, being passive-aggressive....ie not presenting bill in the booklet, slamming pens at payment, being MIA through dining experience.",

    "text": "Wish I could review the food but with waiting for an hour for the food to come with only 2 other tables in the resturant it not going to be worth it.  --Additional info-- I posted the above while waiting on my food and would like to add the following: i asked the serve to please have someone come out and tell me why it took so long for the food to come out (which included 4 sushi rolls and order 2 orders of Lo Mein).  The manager comes out, doesn't apologize at any point for anything and then blames the server for not entering the order quick enough.  I told him that I doubt that was the fact as there were on 2 other tables in the resturant.  He says that he will go check at the sushi bar and get back with me.  He in fact does come back out to talk, be it that it was 10 minutes later, and blames it again on the server, his sushi bar received the order at 8:00 and we got the food at 8:40 and they were busy with other tables and take out orders.  I, with a smile, said which one of the other 2 tables and the 2 people that I saw walk out the door backed them up?  He said he didn't see a problem with the wait and that he didn't see where the issue was. At that point I was furious and Told him that it was obvious that he wasn't concerned about customer satisfaction whatsoever and that it was a shame because the sushi was very good but they wouldn't be around very long with such poor focus on the customer.  I felt so bad for the server knowing that it wasn't her fault and in speaking with her afterwards that the managers often blame the servers for slow service coming out of the kitchen.  So knowing these types of managers I wanted to make sure that the server was taken care of and not punished in any way by the manager withholding tips because of complaints I gave her a very nice tip in cash and paid the bill with a credit card.  So if you have a couple hours to spare and aren't concerned about having to wait an obscene amount of time for your food, then this place isn't bad.  Otherwise don't waste your time and go somewhere else to support the local business.",

We have been here for an hour and not once have we been checked on since we ordered our food 45 minutes ago.  This is our 2nd visit and last time was a bad experience, we decided to give it another shot, which will never happen again .  The food is over priced and the experience, well... there is no experience. I asked for a manager and he came and I explained how we haven't had anyone to check on us. He apologized. Finally our food came, and the chicken curry was tasteless and looked very sloppy. The sushi was decent, nothing spectacular .  Once again , sat here for 20 mins after our food was finished just to see if anyone was going to give us our check.  No one came for 30 minutes, and when he came he laid the check on the table and walked off...... insane.  Do not come here , I repeat you do not want to come here !!!",

    "text": "I love sushi and SO WANT to love this place. I've eaten here at least a dozen times in 2015, and every time I leave I'm literally shaking my head saying \"never again.\" The irony is I quite like the food. It's the service that I find terrible and I believe it starts at the management level. No one is ensuring that everything is going as it should. In fact it's hard to determine who the manager is because no one seems to be in charge.  Employee turnover seemed very high last year as there never seemed to be a familiar face when I'd sit down.   I saw the gamut last year from dirty dining areas (the patio chairs were in dire need of replacement for most of the year), deeply stained concrete in need of a washing, cockroaches running around the patio (I'm not exaggerating). A word on the cockroaches... The servers have acknowledged them explaining nothing can be done as the patio is outdoors.... I've eaten outdoors countless times at many other places and I have never seen anything like this.   There's a bus station for dirty dishes outside on the patio that seldom gets picked up, so dirty dishes pile up. Many of the wait staff are poorly trained if at all, orders forgotten and even our table forgotten entirely. More than once did they seem short staffed as servers run breathlessly trying to keep up.   I do not enjoy writing a negative review. I was raised in the restaurant industry and I think it's one of the hardest businesses to operate. However, from everything I've seen, the issues at this restaurant start at the top. This place has massive potential... and it's being missed. If they could understand and deliver what good (not even great) service was, they'd be doing better than they are.   I've not visited in 2016, and I won't be back, but I've been motivated to share my experiences after hearing a friend express their recent disappointment there.   I WANT to eat here. I like the food here.... I just can't bring myself to support a restaurant that doesn't seem to care about the customer experience.",

It was $12.95 and it was a good amount of food. We went at lunch and I really wish they would've had lunch portions with lunch prices. If you have ever tried out PF Changs I would recommend going to PF Changs. The service wasn't terrible. Our waitress was attentive once we got our food but prior to placing our order we were waiting a good while considering there were only 4 other families in the restaurant.

We ordered the \"Shaken beef\" which was supposed to be one of the popular dishes, but I honestly don't understand why...... the rice was dry and burnt, no sauce or anything for it & vegetables looked like they were left out all day. I took a bite of the beef, and it was cold.... it was like they literally took it out all the ingredients from the fridge and put it on a plate to serve. Sushi was ok... even with their buy one get one free promotion. I couldn't even finish a roll of 5.  I regret not looking at reviews before going here, but at least I can give Yelp and future customers some feedback. Hope this helps.",

I live about 25 mins from this restaurant so we weren't going to immediately head back to the restaurant to get the other two rolls, so we called and claimed we were missing two rolls and that we wanted to come get it once we finished eating. Long story short, the manager claimed he watched the security camera and that the two rolls we claimed we didn't get, were there and basically considered us liars and argued with us for five minutes about how he's confused on our story. He also asked if we had our food items for proof. Worst customer service I have experienced! Extremely upset with how we were treated.",

They were quick with refills when I stayed and when I took it to go, I received silverware, napkins and an extra container to put the shells in. Nothing worse than nowhere to put your discards!

My two other girlfriends and I ordered different martinis and when the server brought them to the table we assumed he put ours down to who ordered what. After a couple sips we realized he mixed up two of our drinks. I had already drank half of the martini he put infront of me so we just requested he make us a new one since he messed up. Then I was charged for both martinis when he messed up by putting the wrong one infront of me!! Then he added an automatic gratuity since there was 6 of us, which I would have been fine paying if I wasn't charged for a martini I didn't order. Overall the service was slow too.   Second time trying this place I went with just my husband. It took 15 minutes for our server to come over, after the hostess brought us drinks because our server was \"busy\" although the restaurant was half empty atleast. The server was not friendly and literally walked up and said \"y'all ready to order\" no apology for being slow or no introduction or anything. Slow service and server acted like she could care less about us, and unfortunately two of our 4 sushi rolls were not even good at all. Usually my husband and I never leave sushi behind but it was so disappointing we left probably 10 pieces. Needless to say we will not be back.",

They have a great atmosphere and lots of seating. You can sit in the formal dining area, the bar, or on the patio.   We love their lettuce wraps and they always have buy one get one on the sushi rolls. I don't really like their spicy tuna rolls there and that makes me sad becuase thats my favorite kind. I recommend the charlotte roll and the bagel roll!   Their noodle stir fry is really good too!   They are not pricy at all either!",

Mongolian beef dish was luke warm at best and sushi (surf &turf and Dragon Roll) very bland.  Worst of all was management, I'd can only assume that he was inexperienced.  We didn't want to sit outside because it was very windy and then after a 45 minute wait we were sat a table in front of an open door blowing in the wind we were trying to avoid. Asked server if they could close the door,  \"sorry my manager said no,\" she replied. So instead of waiting another 45 mins for a table we suffered through for a less than enjoyable dinner. I would say better luck next time, but that would mean I would be coming back!",

Called the waiter over and asked him why the scallions were missing. He informs me it's a different dish. I educate him that the menu says scallions are included in the pad thai. He says he'll get me a side of scallions. 15 minutes later, waiter comes back and says the chefs are out of scallions. Wouldn't you inform your customer that a crucial ingredient is missing before they order? Or, you know, have the decency to tell them when you serve them?  So I ask the waiter if they'll comp the chicken ($1) in place of the scallion. He said no, because it's still extra... $1...   Didn't get a refill for 20 minutes until I asked for it. Didn't get a spoon for 15 minutes after I asked for it. So disappointing. I have eaten here before and the service wasn't great, but it wasn't this poor of quality. Won't be returning here or bringing guests here. Many better choices in the area.",

Brought my daughter here for Christmas break celebration and was very disappointed in the size and amount of roll for the price (which is totally built into the bogo 'deal'). The avocado in her California roll was browning and speckled and the avocado in my cherry blossom roll was mushy brown-completely rotted in 4 of the pieces. I brought this to my waitresses attention who sent whom I thought was the hostess over (come to find she is the manager) and asked if we wanted another one or for it to be taken off the bill. My daughter was still hungry so I asked for hers to be remade, but I had lost my appetite and didn't want a replacement for mine. Check came charging for all rolls. When I questioned the manager and stated she had said that she would take it off the bill, she completely backpeddled and said she could only give 10% off if I don't want to remade. Any business that is ok with serving food of poor quality and charging their customers full-price is not one that one where I will choose to spend my money! Disgraceful!",

    "text": "First let me start by saying that when going out to dinner I am VERY easy to please. All I ask is that you take my order and bring my food. Having been a server for many years I know how tough it can be so I really don't expect too much nor do I need too much. So let me begin explaining my \"lovely\" experience at Akahana on July 27th at 6:00 p.m (I added that info so hopefully they will know which server I am speaking about as I did not get her name). I walk in with my party and was greeted by a very friendly face who immediately took us to our table. Our server walked over very promptly and took our drink order........that's when the good service stopped. We all ordered waters, I ordered a beer and 2 women ordered a somewhat difficult drink. We sat there for 20 minutes, YES 20 minutes waiting for our drinks....including the waters....while we sat and waited we watched our waitress standing by the bar, chatting and laughing with who I later found out was the manager. She didn't leave the bar to bring us our waters or to even apologize for the delay. She stood there laughing and talking while we were all starving and waiting to put our orders in. One of the ladies in our group walked up to her and kindly asked if she would come take our order, as she is pregnant and starving. Only to be told in a VERY rude manner that she was waiting for our drinks and when they were ready she would be over to take our order. We let that go and didn't say anything about it. Then she proceeded to bring over my drink, then went back to grab the two other drinks but not the last one. At this point I had enough and started to tell her that we have been waiting 20 minutes for our drinks and that we watched her just stand there when she could have come by, maybe apologized and taken our order. She proceeded to tell me she was waiting for our drinks and when I went to speak up, she cut me off and told me to order. I have NEVER had such a rude waitress and it's sad because I have been away from Fort Mill for a year and the only restaurant I really wanted to go back to was Akahana, I love the food here but with servers like that representing your brand, you're going to end up pushing customers away. I ended up asking to see a manager, who came over and proceeded to explain she was making our drinks. I told her that I completely understood but to be sitting here for 20 minutes without even water or our order taken was ridiculous and VERY poor service. I asked her if we could please have a new server and she ended up sending Holly over. Let me say that if I would have started off the night with Holly, I wouldn't be writing this review right now. Holly was fantastic, very accommodating, very friendly and SUPER helpful. I love this place and hate that I had to have this experience but again you really need to think about who you're hiring to represent your restaurant. A friendly smile and a warm personality make all the difference when it comes to dealing working in the service industry.",

I think the menu is too diverse and it would be a challenge to deliver authentically on all those options. The menu also does not accurately describe the dishes, and the wait staff was not knowledgable enough to assist and or even provide the correct answers. This led to total dissaction as the waitor obviously knew as he apoligized while he served the food. Of the 5 dishes we ordered, only 1 was ok with the other 4 less than average. Very disappointing experience.",

    "text": "I have been here for lunch a couple of times and the service was just ok, meaning it took a while to get our food.  When you typically have an hour to eat during lunch you really should get your food delivered within 10 min. Max of ordering.  This took at least 20 and they weren't busy at all.  Although BOGO is a great marketing idea be aware that the size of your sushi when it is \"take out\" is much smaller size (just bite size) then when you eat in.    I went on a Friday night around 7:30pm for take out understanding it would be busier than usual, I decided to order a drink from the bar, then order my food.  The bar was packed and soon realized it was because people were waiting for a table, which is a good sign that the food is worth the wait.  However, I stood right at the bar for a good 10 min and neither of the 2 bartenders acknowledged me or my friend and they came by us many times.  I get when a bar is busy but you need to acknowledge your customers at least with 'I'll be right with you'.  FINALLY got our dirty martini order with the male bartender and get our drinks which were in the short, no stem martini glasses and only 3/4 full with 1 olive, so disappointed with that but then got the bill!!!!   $8 each with a $1 prep fee on top of that!!!!!  What is that??  I mean we are in Fort Mill, not NY or even Charlotte!  Anyway, decided to order the take out and they said it was a 45 min wait on food.  So very disappointed in the entire exp.",

FIrst i do want to start by saying our waitress by all means was the best and very helpful but the food was terrible. I had the pineapple shrimp rice it actually was pretty good aside the fact that it was barely hot, my boyfriend had the mongolian beef dinner the meat tasted  horrible i thought at first he was over exaggerating but nope not only was it not hot or warm was not good to taste at all and funny flavor.He expressed to our waitress he didnt want it or anything else not one time did the manager on duty come out and ask what was the problem? Is it anything else he could do to make him happy? Nothing at all. Today is 9/27/17 on a wendsday and we were there at 8ish untll close to closeing . Far as my drink that was okay you could taste the basil in the drink and a tad bit watered down. I would never patron this business again even if someone paid me. Visit at your own risk.",

I was put on hold for 17 minutes and no one ever came back on the line so I kept calling back only to be put on hold again!

It was more authentic than I was expecting for a non specific Vietnames place! It came with all the traditional pho fixings. I would highly recommend trying the pho.  Next time we go back, and I assure you, there will be a next time...I will be having sushi rolls as well (even though I know I will have leftovers). The sushi rolls are buy one get one free. How awesome! There were many other Asian dishes I have yet to try!   The only reason I did not rate five stars was because the service was not top notch.

I had the rainbow roll, spicy tuna roll, and my daughter had California rolls.    The rainbow rolls were not good at all. I had one piece of salmon that actually tasted like Salmon. The rest of the roll was tasteless.    The spicy tuna was average but lacked spicy tuna.   The rice was dry.  All around it just isn't good.   Disappointing as they have a great location in an area that would pay for quality fish to be served.   Service was terrible. Really slow and socially awkward.  It took me 10 min to flag down our server to get the check.   The buy one get one free Is a joke.  They just jack up the prices of one roll to make it even out.  $14 for a 8pc rainbow roll - but justifiable when you get one free.  But they were both terrible. Lol",

My party of 7 was pretty comfortable at our table next to a window in the large dining room with sky high ceilings.  The calamari appetizer was chewy - nothing to write home about. I ordered chicken pad Thai for dinner and mentioned to our server, Haily, that I was worried about the spice. She suggested omitting the jalapenos included in the dish, so I did. Once dinner came out, I was disappointed in my completely flavorless pad Thai. I ate a few bites before I resorted to just eating the chicken.  My experience here was only hindered by the taste of the food. Haily was incredibly pleasant, timely and polite!  My food was just sub par.",

As we waited I saw lots of employees standing around doing nothing, and most of the empty tables stayed empty for nearly an hour.  Management must have changed because this place used to always be packed... Now you can't get a table in a half empty restaurant. Makes no sense.  The food is not bad, but it is a little pricey. 1 appetizer, 2 adult entrees, 2 drinks and 2 kids meals cost us over $70. We don't pay that much anywhere else in Fort Mill.  Unfortunately it's the only Asian-fusion restaurant in the area, so there's not any other options. Once they get some competition I can't imagine them staying open unless they find a way to better manage the place.",

The first time we just ordered it by chance and it was instant love, probably because its taste kind of reminded of some Indian food that we love.

It lets me get a wide variety of sushi and have plenty of food for a good price. I've also got to have a few of their curry noodle dishes which are pretty filling and flavorful as well. One of my favorite things on the menu that I had never had until I came here is the Inari. My girlfriend introduced it to me and it's a pretty simple and tasty appetizer if you're looking to have a little something before your full meal comes. I haven't had very many of their cocktails but the ones I've had were made pretty well and weren't too pricey. This last time we tried the raspberry basil mojito and it was really refreshing and well balanced. If you love sushi and/or a variety of noodle/rice dishes then this is a good place to go.",

A Friday night is pretty busy and we found out you can make a reservation which they suggest for s Friday or Saturday night. We had about a 25 minute wait.   We've been here a couple of times and service has been slow each time. Our server was friendly and patient, but it seemed like the food took a while to come out.   They have a variety of Asian dishes like sushi, Chinese food,and noodles, soups and pho. Iordered two sushi rolls and a summer roll. The sushi rolls are always buy one, get one free. For me it was okay. The summer roll was chewy and I wish there was more lettuce than noodles inside. The peanut dipping sauce was alright. The sushi was fresh and good, but nothing unique on the flavor pallette. One of my rolls had spicy tuna in it, but I  couldn't taste the heat. Myusband enjoyed his pad Thai.   Overall there's a cool vibe and a variety of Asian food. And the portions are huge if you can wait for it. We just like other places more.",

Typically I sit at the bar with my boyfriend because the bartender is extremely consistent and makes great recommendations. She was not present so we sat outside at a table. After waiting for our food for over an hour the waitress brought out the food Luke warm. I want to make clear that this was not the waitresses fault but all to often this place is understaffed and it puts to much stress on the servers. Another complaint is that they never seem to have a manager on duty. Apparently he comes in at 4 on the weekends and that is a problem. I hope that this place gets better because they have awesome food but suffer from execution of every other aspect of the restaurant  business.",

When we order I always let them know of my daughters celiac and they are cordial about being careful, changing their gloves etc...She had her standard Rainbow Roll & California Roll.  She enjoyed it.  I think the sushi is fine for what it is.  BOGO, so it's not \"High end\" but it is fine.   I had the Pad Thai for the first time.  I've been eating my food spicier and this dish was very tasty.  Slight smokiness to the sauce.  It had jalapenos mixed in and serviced with a side of chili paste so I could add more kick.  I ate most of it and would have it again.  One thing about the service.  Service was fine, but I had a direct view into the servers area where they have a little area in between the kitchen and the sushi bar.  I saw one of the servers vaping...she blew a \"fat cloud\" while I was staring right at her.  Pretty gross!",

    "text": "I would not be able to recommend another spot in the greater Rock Hill/ Fort Mill area for sushi over Akahana. The BOGO offer is a great deal for sushi grade quality rolls. Also, if you are just in the mood for grabbing a couple drinks and a small amount of food, the bar area is perfect to mingle with locals and quench your craving. I suggest adding some chili oil to the chicken lettuce wraps to start off while having a glass of wine or some Basil Hayden on the rocks. The alcohol is priced as good as it gets for a restaurant or bar. The daily specials are also a big hit with half off wine bottles once or twice a week being a great deal for vino lovers. The wait can certainly be a bit long on a Friday or Saturday night, so if you have a larger party, I would suggest making a reservation to secure your spot while not having to wait 45 minutes or so. This is a positively trending spot. Go check Akahana out if you are having an asian craving.",

I knew he wasn't paying us to much attention because there was a table that sat down after us that got their food way before us. I order summer rolls and it didn't even come with peanut sauce. It took awhile for the server to come back and check on us so I just ended up eating it without the peanut sauce. I order Pho for dinner and it was very bland.

I ordered the calamari (it sounded delish) it was WAY over cooked and needed salt and pepper. (The sauce that came with it was very good)  I ordered two sushi rolls. (I tend to order semi/cooked rolls at places I am not familiar with) one roll was tuna and the entire roll was flash fried. The roll was just bland. It tasted like I was eating flour. Don't get me wrong it was flash fried to perfection, it just had zero taste. And the tuna and veggies inside were mediocre.   Same goes for my second roll. It was a tempura shrimp, wrapped in rice and topped with raw tuna and crab salad. The didn't look like tuna  and again the roll had zero flavor which it had a ton of ingredients.   I really wanted to love this place because the things I ordered sounded amazing on the menu. But it was disappointing.",

Turns out the manager was the guy our waitress was chatting with for about 10 minutes while we waited for our check. All this with the restaurant empty except for one other party. I'm also not one to leave negative reviews. Most places do a passable job. This was the worst service I can recall ever receiving.",

I eat sushi once a week, and I've had it at quite a few places around town.  This visit offered the most terrible quality fish I've had in my entire life. The sashimi was absolutely atrocious!!!  The salmon was okay, but the yellowtail and the tuna were by far the worst quality I've ever come across.  I honestly would rather have canned tuna all day than the cardboard textured, fishy tasting crap that showed up on my plate.  I swear, I don't know how they thought it was okay to serve it, but I digress. We also ordered several rolls, I ate only 2-3 pieces of each roll.  It was just too terrible to stomach anymore.  When I got back from the bathroom, my wife mentioned how she almost threw up at the table.  There was just something \"off\" with the rolls, I'm not sure how else to describe it.  It definitely wasn't in my head, it was just terrible, terrible quality. The good news was that the service was great, and the bill was ONLY $50, which wasn't bad for the amount of food we got.   If you are looking for sushi, I highly recommend pretty much anywhere else.  Publix is just up the road, and their grocery store sushi blows this stuff away, sadly.",

My server was fast and got to us in seconds right when we walked in and served us really well. We had spicy edamame for appetizers and it was lovely. I tried the chicken pad thai and I am in love with it! I also had a volcano roll which is by far my favorite now and I got a spicy tuna roll and it was amazing! My girlfriends had the mixed vegetable dish and she said it was good and my other girlfriend had sushi as well. Overall, the food is absolutely amazing and its in a great part of town. I recommend this place to everyone! It is wonderful. I hope it last long too, since it has recently taken over the old Liu Liu's restaurant. Go Akahana!",

We love this place and come often (take out more than sit in)  This review is about the service. We came here for dinner tonight - table of five. we were all hungry for sushi.  I could tell from the onset it was not going to be a good experience. our waiter was simply not attentive, not available, and not the right personality for that role. Let's review our 80 minutes there -  four adults each ordering two sushi rolls each.  three ordered water, one ordered sweet tea. and we ordered three  appetizers beforehand. okay, we asked for a few differences - but nothing major. simple things like no ginger, add spicy mayo, one added cucumber. We waited an exceptionally long time for dinner. no visit from the waiter. no service ware, no napkins. no water fill ups.  when the food came my order of a Charlotte roll came out as a California roll. he seemed shocked that I said it was wrong - pointed to my daughters plate who also ordered a Charlotte roll as to say \"there it is!\". i said leave it here they will eat it, obviously meaning we would pay for it. he took my plate and said no then you will have to pay for it and whisked it away. when he came back he all be showed me he wrote down a California roll. I Do Not Care what you wrote, you didn't write what I ordered. I even said no cream cheese, which is not in a California roll.  we didn't get any wasabi without asking three times, didn't get an appetizer of spring rolls without asking three times (skip them, no good), didn't get soy sauce bowls without going up and getting them ourselves (same for chopsticks), we seemed to be BOTHERING the waiter anytime we asked anything (mainly water refills), and the restaurant was not busy. If he's new he needs to be better trained. If not new, he needs. serious refresher course in waiting tables.  I felt bad only tipping 10% but honestly I don't even think he deserved that.",

The bagel roll and the chicken wings are the best things popping here, but the Pad-Thai looks and smells disgusting ( I did not try it since I was already turned off by the visual). The spring rolls, tempura shrimp, and spicy edamame are all good, but you can't really mess those up.  All in all, I eat here due to convenience, not because it's the best.  It can also get quite pricey.  BOGO sushi seems like a great deal until you realize that the price of a roll is upwards of $10-12.  Also, if you eat in, the service will be quite slow, regardless of how empty it may look.",

I immediately called the restaurant to let them know the situation, that we had paid for the full order and that we were on our way back. They agreed to complete the order and have it ready for us to pick up. Neither on the phone nor when we arrived, did we receive anything in the way of an apology for their error or our inconvenience (we live about 20 minutes away from the restaurant). No apology, no comp, no effort on their part at all to right their wrong. And to make matters worse, they filled the remaining order incorrectly. I understand human error and am typically forgiving of that as long as you OWN your screw up. There are too many other Asian restaurants around here to choose from to have to be treated so poorly.",

The tempura was so thick on the food and the veggies were still hard and raw - I have never had tempura that bad before.  I asked the waitress if I could not get yellow tail as part of a nigiri dinner option and they could just give me two other kinds on the plate already instead.  She just told me no and didn't even check with anyone and I really don't see how that would be an unreasonable request...  Since I hate yellow tail so much, I decided to order a tuna and rice bowl.  The prices of the rolls are crazy expensive even for non-specialty ones.  For example, spicy tuna is more than $10 - I want to say its closer to $15.  The veggie rolls were BOGO so my husband got two of those and they were just ok.  I would never go back to this place.  it's really overpriced and the food isn't even good!",

I came for lunch the other day, and against my better judgement tried an Indian dish. Believe me when I say, there was absolutely nothing wrong with the dish and it was VERY good. I was simply jealous of all the other more Asian dishes in my party of 10.   Per the dish I had, a chicken dish with yellow curry with white rice, made great use of curry sauce ingredients as well as a fresh vegetable medley- sprinkled with fresh jalopenos. It was fairly hot outside that day on their patio so I can't really pin-point my sweating due to the dish or the heat. My guess is a combination of the two (most likely), and I will say it had the perfect kick. The dish had a perfect flavor balance and was not skimpy on its proportion.   In general, it seemed like just about every dish on the table for in upwards of $9, for a lunch menu item, seemed well worth it proportion-wise. All 10 plates looked delectable and it seems to me it wouldn't be hard to find a new, great dish off their menu.  Aside from enjoying a lunch here, the interior is such that would warrant a great date night. Very modern and upscale decor. I haven't looked to hard into their dinner menu, but I can assume quality, quantity, and price are all adequately proportioned, as in lunchtime.",

Pretty nice presentation, too. Service is a little slow.  On to the food! My boyfriend has a gluten allergy, and the chef was happy to make some informed suggestions about safe options, which was pretty cool. The miso is too salty... I really don't like it at all. I have to say that I'm also not really a fan of their fried sushi rolls - the batter is a little too thick for my taste, kind of like fancy fish sticks. However, I will say that the other rolls I've had were quite delicious.  The Cherry Blossom Roll is simple, and though I'm not usually for the simpler rolls, it was actually very flavorful and fresh. I'd order it again. I also have had a Spicy Tuna Roll, and though the taste wasn't completely my thing (a bit saltier than expected, maybe?), it was True to its word about the heat. The Florida Roll tastes great with spicy salmon swapped out for the tuna (EDIT: I've been told they do not do substitutions anymore). This thing was definitely packed to the brim with fish. No skimping there.  Hands down, though, my #1 recommendation is the Tropical Exotic Roll. It's unique and SO tasty! Don't be scared off by the odd-looking soy paper and the unusual, cute little triangles it's cut in - that's part of what makes it delicious! I'm planning on getting it again my next visit for sure.  Their prices are kind of high, but I was told they always have BOGO sushi, so that's how they balance the deal. I'm not sure about the other types of food they serve, but if you're into sushi, give them a try!  EDIT: I have now also tried their pho. It's okay, but definitely isn't memorable. Pretty bland. Wouldn't recommend.",

Offered nothing but apologies until I casually reminded her that I paid full price for a fraction of a meal. Now I get to go in tomorrow morning for a full refund. Between inattentive waitstaff and this being the second time they've had a major issue keeping an order straight, we observe a self-evident, disturbing, and quite frankly damning trend: quality of service has taken a similar nosedive here over the last 5 months, on multiple levels. This is the nadir. I'd been excited about this place at first after having recently moved here but now its staff cannot even assemble and hand off the meal that I paid for. I guess my $5 tip on that take-out order was ethically gratuitous at the end of the day. More like fake-out order. I try to go out of my way to support establishments that treat me well in turn. This social contract is ended. Time to progress to more competent East Asian cuisine in the Fort Mill/Rock Hill area.",

It's in the space previously inhabited by Liu Liu's in Baxter Village, and this is a significant upgrade from that Asian restaurant.  The servers at Akahana aim to please; they're attentive and friendly, but not overbearing.  Our particular waiter seemed a little new and unsure, but it was sweet - E for effort.  The menu itself is extensive to the point of being almost overwhelming.  It offers all kinds of sushi, pad thai, lo mein, even curry dishes!  It took us a decent amount of time to find the wine because it's listed UNDER the sushi it pairs well with.  Neither of us was getting sushi, so we skipped over that part of the menu thinking it was just sushi.  The fella got a glass of white wine, and I got the Passion Saketini ($8), which tasted like pineapple with vodka.   We got the spring roll appetizer ($4.95), which is always my gauge of how good any Asian restaurant is.  It was deeeelicious!  There were two rolls, and they were much bigger than at most restaurants.  The outside texture was light and crispy, and it was stuffed full of fresh, thick pork.  For entrees, I got the Chicken Lo Mein ($9.95), and the fella got the Soft Egg Noodle with chicken ($10.95).  Although the portions were huge, I ate almost my entire plate.  The fellas noodles were a little thinner than mine, and he said his was really good, but I was too busy stuffing my face to try his.  Although we didn't get any sushi, it looked beautiful when I saw it carried by our table.  The place was hopping at 6:30 on a Friday night, and I hope it does well.  It seems like a great addition to Baxter with indoor seating, a covered outdoor seating area, and a bar area.  The prices are very reasonable, and the food is pretty outstanding, too.  So glad it's finally open!",

This location is in Baxter village so parking can be a pain depending on what time of the day you go. Thankfully late Sunday afternoons aren't really crowded. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere inside but I can imagine it gets chaotic when it is busy. The service this time was much better and more attentive than the last time, which was almost non-existent on my previous trip. I ordered the chicken fried rice and my wife got the Mongolian beef. Both dishes were pretty good but it felt like there was more to be desired, maybe a bit more sauce on the beef, however with a little side of shrimp sauce the chicken fried rice was great. I'm not a big sushi eater but from what I understand this is one of the better places to get sushi in the Rock HIll / Fort Mill area and frequently has good deals. Overall it is a good restaurant and I recommend trying this place at least once before forming an opinion.",

We get our receipts and it's all messed up! So we tried to tell him what's who's and so forth and he seem like he was not listening and was rushing. So he took the receipts away. Then my boyfriend decides to go to him to make sure it's right so that way when he comes back he doesn't have to go fix it again. My boyfriend told me he didn't even give eye contact and just said alright. Told him that our friend had an extra roll that's ours but it's not supposed to be on theirs or ours because ours was already charged once already for the same roll. He gives us the receipts and all he did was move that roll to ours so we were charged for the same roll twice! I've been to Akahana for some years now. Never experienced any trouble. I remember when this guy was working and now that he's been here this long he seems to be a real mess and I really don't appreciate how he worked w us. Very upsetting! Luckily my boyfriend is a really sweet person and still tips what should be tipped than deduct any dollar from a persons attitude or way.",

I am starting to get the impression that the management knows customers will continue to frequent Akahana, regardless of the atrocious service solely by the fact that the food is excellent.  It really is a shame that this restaurant has seemingly made no attempt to address the issues with poor wait staff, even though it is a well known fact that it is terrible. Get takeout if you are planning to eat here",

    "text": "I stopped in for lunch after a client meeting today and all and all thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I wasn't feeling too adventurous with my menu selections and opted to keep it simple with a house salad, solely for the purpose of the ginger dressing, and a Philly sushi roll. The standard menu items that I ordered were delicious and I gobbled them up right away. The service was super friendly and fast. Any need that we had was meet before we could ask for it. I even believe that the server picked up on the fact that I was gabbing away to my coworker and respected that fact being attentive without interrupting.  The atmosphere was great. I think my favorite part about this experience was the decor. Typically, I find that places like this tend to go overboard, but everything here was balanced. There was just the right amount of culture, while maintaining a contemporary feel to the restaurant. For example, hanging down from the ceiling, they had brightly colored open umbrellas (hanging from the handles) and behind the sushi bar, the backdrop was a water fall wall. I'm not too familiar with the Baxter Village scene, but would venture to guess this would be a great place to post up and do some people watching on their massive patio.  Overall, my impression of this place was solid. The food didn't \"wow\" me, but it was a great place to stop in for lunch.",

    "text": "Literally just walked out the front door because we felt so uncomfortable and so unwelcome in this restaurant. My boyfriend and I decided to go for lunch and get their buy one get one free sushi. Upon walking in, the host was not welcoming and seemed annoyed that he had to seat us. A waiter was sitting at one of the tables on his phone. Our waitress came over immediately and got our drink order but left us to sit for 15 minutes without getting our food order. Mind, there were just two tables of two inside and a party of 6 outside and there was extra help but they didn't seem to care. The host just stood there and looked on. The waitress seemed preoccupied with the party outside and didn't seem to care much about anyone inside. Then the two girls sitting next to us asked to be moved to a different table. This was the last straw for me.The whole atmosphere felt very snooty and rude. I looked at my boyfriend and said I'm ready to go now and we left. We've consistently gotten this kind of service from this location over the past few times we've eaten here. I'm not about to spend 15 plus dollars a plate on awful service like this. We will not be coming back. Most of the time I don't bother with reviews unless the service is fantastic but I could not keep my mouth shut about crappy experience.",

    "text": "Always look forward to coming or ordering out at Akahana.  Amazing sushi.  The sushi is better than the hot entrees albeit the hot entrees are above average.  I always get either the crunchy roll or the Charlotte Roll.  The Charlotte roll is is packed with flavor.  A must try if you are feeling adventurous.    The quality is great every time whether we dine in or take out.  The presentation, taste, etc. is exceptional. Can't beat the BOGO sushi roll special!  Akahana is one of the few sushi spots in the Fort Mill area.  It's located conveniently in Baxter to enjoy before or after a night in the area. The ambiance is pleasant with both indoor and outdoor seating.  Akahana is within walking distance of all other shops and nightlife spots in Baxter.  The owner is very nice and introduced himself and talked to us last time we were in.  A week later we saw him while in the area and he recognized us. He offered to buy us sushi next time we were in. It meant a lot that he remembered us.  Only qualm I have is that the draft beer was either stale or the tap system needed cleaned.  I had a NoDa Jam Session and it tasted skunked.  All in all I love dining at Akahana when I'm in the mood for some good sushi. Definitely recommend if you are ever in the area and looking to get something out of the ordinary.",

What a poor excuse, and unbelievable that the manager would put a new employee on the \"big tables\". We are not a difficult party. 5 of us. We just want some silver ware...   I read the other reviews, MANY of which have had my same experience. Large staff turn over, poor service, rude manager...  I want to love this place. So kitchen staff, you get 10 stars.

I can be understanding if its busy (i used to be a server) and we did have 8 people in our party but they were not even busy in our section was only 2 other tables and there were three sushi chefs on duty. I don't get why it took like an hr and half to receive any food. The food also was alright it wasn't amazing for how long we had to wait either. I'm guessing thats why it wasn't packed and it was a saturday night. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the server was really nice and the other time I went it was a more pleasant experience but to be honest because of this past weekend it will be awhile before I come back.",

When we asked to get it replaced he/she looked worried and ran to speak with a manager. He/she came back a few moments later and said it would be made right. We asked what that meant and he/she told us he/she would have to pay for that mistake bc the kitchen refuses to take back any food, especially if the server makes a mistake. Seriously?!?! We all make mistakes, and the kitchen should be understanding in these situations. Needless to say, the issue was fixed and we were sure to take good care of our dear server tip-wise for the kind deed done. A word of advice to the business, take care of and be nice to your servers or you won't have any and then you will shut down like all the other places that have been in the location!",
