I haven't had any issues with lines or wait times, simply directed towards a vacant table upon arrival. The seafood is fresh and of great quality. Their dishes are portioned well at a medium to large size. I recommend ordering a plate of their Fat Baby oysters, they're silky and huge. This is the perfect place to fill up on delicious seafood!",

The food is amazing though!! Ordered the oysters Noda (a favorite), two types of oysters, Maine mussels (another favorite), corn fritters, duck tacos and vegetable of the day. Oh and can't forget dessert- cinnamon pot du creme. Service was a bit slow and I think that our waitress forgot about us for a while. Noisy atmosphere.

The place is big, considering it's uptown and in the Hearst Tower. They offer to comp your parking as long as you park in the tower so bring your garage ticket with you. If you ever been to the Lobster Place in Chelsea Market in NYC that's what this place reminded me of. Lots of table room and space. We had different servers throughout our meal so that was a little bit confusing. Foods came out prompt and everyone seemed to have enjoyed their meal. Every course was filling and perfectly cooked and seasoned. Overall we thought this place was great and definitely worth coming back to, especially for the $1 oysters happy hour during the week.",

    "text": "I was craving some seafood and I also knew after consuming said sea food I wanted to get a  drink at one of my favorite bars in Charlotte, Connoly's. Well, Sea Level is right next door so this was a winning combo for a date night. We got there after 7 pm which meant no partaking of the 4/7 pm Monday through Saturday happy hour where oysters (I'm sure not all varieties) are $1. Still ok though. I was with my husband and we started with cocktails; I got a dirty Tito's martini that hit the spot and my husband got a krampus. I selected one each of the kumamoto and rappahannock oysters. They set me back 2.75 each which I don't mind paying for since they are quality oysters and soon waters will be getting to warm for oysters so getting them all in while I can! We shared the corn fritters which were disappointing as they were more hush puppy than corn but they were good, just not what I expect in a corn fritter. They were also round-ish like a hush puppy and not pancake-ish in shape like a fritter. Just a bit misleading. For dinner I got the lobster roll which was great and on a buttered, grilled roll. I paired that with a house salad. My guy picked off the sides menu and created a dinner of the fish taco, duck taco and pork belly steam bun. The fish taco and bun were his favorites.  I like this place and the staff was on point as well.",

For the price - you can do much better in CLT.   BUT. The host and hostess were horrid.   First - I called on Friday and tried to make a reservation. I was told they don't 'do' reservations. Ok. That's odd. It's a nice restaurants - I expected reservations - but again was told they don't 'do' reservations.   What they meant was they were booked full.   That is 2 VERY different things.  So, we went on Saturday. Walked in and - yep - were asked for our reservation. But wait... I was told yesterday - you don't 'do' reservations. Blah blah blah, (uncaring and general blah) - was the response from the hostess.   We were directed to a 'first-come-first-serve' area - it worked - two stools at a communal table.   Neither host bothered to bring us a menu or utensils. Then, sitting in the 'you didn't have a reservation - even though you called' section, I watched a host play on his phone all night.   As we got up to leave - he surely wasn't bothered to open the door for my mother who was visiting.   Excellent service starts at the first interaction. Excellence was, for sure, lacking with the first and last 'touch'.",

From the first call we made to see if they had a table to the final course of the night the service was exceptional. Our server could not have done a finer  job helping us navigate their menu. She offered honest and intelligent insight into every question we asked about their various dishes.  The oysters were fresh and delicious. The flounder awesome. The restaurant menu was quite well laid out with something for everybody even though strange creatures who go to a seafood restaurant and want a hamburger. LOL  I always love a seafood restaurant that doesn't have everything on the menu all the time. It's a great sign that they're buying really fresh fish all the time. There's a reason why special dishes are special dishes and it's not because they've bought something mediocre in bulk. This place got it and got it right from the oysters that started our meal to the Keylime ice cream that ended it with everything in between perfect!  If you haven't been here yet you need to get here now. Enjoy!",

They purchase fresh ingredients on a daily basis and build the day's menu based on those ingredients.  That said, you don't know what you might find upon entering the restaurant.

    "text": "We visited Sea Level NC Saturday night for a friend's birthday celebration. Our first issue was our table wasn't available until 15 minutes after our reservation time. When we inquired about the reason for this, the host immediately \"got an attitude\" and was very rude. They proceeded to sit us in an area where several of our members were cold, when we asked to be moved, again we were greeted with an attitude.   We were waiting for a few others in our party to arrive, so we inquired about shots. Our server couldn't accurately advise which liquor was in the various shots she recommended. There were a few in our party that wanted to order shots of 1800 tequila. They were disappointed to find the bar didn't have it in stock.  Our final complaint was our waitress was very slow. We had to wait 10 minutes to receive water, had to wait 5-10 minutes for her to appear after each of our additional party members arrived (the restaurant was half empty so there was no excuse for this), and 15 minutes for her to bring the check at the end. The food was just \"okay\" in my opinion (but I've lived in Houston, Maryland, and Louisiana and am used to \"great\" seafood so the lack of great customer service and a fully stocked bar, in addition to mediocre food, are the reasons I won't return nor recommend this establishment.",

The fiance made a reservation for 7:30 on a Friday night, but we were surprised to find that we didn't even need it. There were a good number of tables available but the place had a good energy. We chose to sit outside since it was a nice evening.   Our server came over after we had just a few moments with the menu and we both ordered cocktails. I had the meow mule and my fiance ordered the smoked old fashioned. I really like the mule cause it was light, not too sugary, and decently boozy.   Since this is one of the few True seafood places in Charlotte, we ordered the Snapper and the Trigger fish dishes, planning to switch halfway through the meal. The trigger had a nice crablike taste to it, which our waiter explained is because they eat  crustaceans. It came with a yummy sauce and rice. The snapper had crispy skin, was buttery, and came over a wonderful succotash.   Prices are a little higher than I'd like to pay for the average dinner out, but it's good quality and nice for a special occasion.",

    "text": "I decided to try Sea Level again after a few months and to order some different items and give them a chance.  I had a really great experience second time around and am happy to report I will be back again.  This last time left me wanting more!  I started with the fish taco, Sea Level oysters ($1: 4P-7P), and the ghost pepper pommarita.  The taco only came with one (I wish more) but was delicious!!  I definitely recommend getting a few of these as a meal. Very good.  The oysters were phenomenal and very large.  The were served with horseradish, cocktail, and a mignonette (which I never had in my life). I can't wait to have these again!! The pommarita was right up my alley:spicy and a touch of sweet, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.   For dinner (as if I didn't eat enough already) I chose the Tile fish with corn gazpacho, tomatillos, and duck fat potatoes. YUM!!! The potatoes were extra crispy and the gazpacho added a hint of sweet to the dish.  I literally want this again right as I type.  The tile fish was mild and crispy.   To finish I had the blueberry cheesecake shooter.  It was rich and delightful.  Nathan was our server, he made the second chance experience outstanding.  He was really nice and patient.  I thank him for taking really good care of us.   It's all about what you choose on the menu, and the first time I just chose all wrong. Read reviews, look at pictures and ask for Nathan.  He recommended some things and was spot on with his descriptions.  I'm glad that I went back and will be back some more.",

After walking around down Charlotte (my fault) looking for the restaurant I finally found it.  Very nice spot on 5th with a great feel to it.  There's a nice bar and the ambiance to the place.  I sat down with the guys and joined in. All of their appetizers looked delicious.  I ordered a crown and coke and for my dinner I had shrimp and grits with a nice gravy on it. It came out quick and hot. Delicious meal! I'd definitely order it again along with the meals my frat brothers ordered as well.  The only thing that was bad was the service. Our service was too nice. I wish I had her name But she did too good a job making sure we had drinks and food in a timely fashion. I mean the nerve of her. All I know is if I remember to come back to ask for her.  This is a nice restaurant and it's someplace I'd come back to. Until next time...",

This time I ordered the salmon (which I was asked how I wanted it ...) Waiter suggested to let the chef choose how to serve it. I must say that I was skeptical that it was served over sweet potatoes (I do not care for) but let me tell you! When I took a bite of my food! I made umm and omg noises the whole time I ate it. My food was so good and so was the hubby. The salmon was juicy and flavorful, I even liked the sweet potatoes.Staff are always super friendly and nice. They also asked if we needed our parking ticket valet. I will def go back to try the paella next time. Love the atmosphere",

The service was good and the drinks were good and the food was delicious.   I started with the fish taco app and it's so tasty. Super fresh and well seasoned. I could eat a a few of these!   To drink I tried the ghost pepper pomegranate pommarita. It was just the right amount of spicy blended with the pomegranate mix and it was spot on! I'd absolutely recommend!   For dinner I had the salmon with crispy potatoes and a house salad. My salmon was cooked perfectly! Nice and tender and the addition of the aioli was such a nice touch of flavor! The potatoes were crispy and well seasoned and the maple ginger dressing is homemade and awesome.   Our waiter Nathan was kind and informative and very attentive! He's so knowledgeable about the menu don't be afraid to ask him questions!  I'm completely putting the first visit out of my mind. This time I was won over and I'm looking forward to another visit!",

    "text": "5 stars for the owner contact via Yelp. 5 stars for the goal service and trying to ensure customers are met with satisfaction.  4 stars for not presenting info that the HEARST parking deck is free for lunch or dinner. I was worried it was only for dinner and drove by it twice.  4 stars for the french fry that was so hard it cut my molar gum area where the wisdom tooth is located and was extracted back in 1997. Yeah... how do I know it happened. I kept feeling a tingle and once I tried putting a tad of ketchup on another fry and that salt got into the OPEN wound..... whew doggie!   That's what I get for eating while driving.   Anywhoo, I'm ecstatic that you can get the Connecticut - True NE style - solely butter by asking the morning before they open. They set aside enough lobster that I thought it was generous and so did a colleague. I'll try the chowder and maybe a slider but honey~~~   I will get to brunch and have a LOBSTER ROLL with only butter SANS mayo over the weekend.  I'm glad they are open for the weekend nowadays with Brunch offerings.   Also, the little bookmark with upcoming events placed in my bag is super cute. They are hosting events 1st Mondays for the next four months.   Oh, a few rude customers  Sweet security/sheriff guy working the parking deck.  Preferred Parking has some good people working here as I misplaced my parking ticket and they got it all straighten out.  Inside the building the security staff was pleasant in escorting me to the garage entry so I wouldn't walk up the exit.  Recap: Don't miss the toasted Lobster roll as the bread is the right style and right about of toasting. The lobster is NOT langostino. This is real sweet meat lobster. It's $19/per lobster roll.  Comes with a side of handcut fries. Next time I'll seek out what the substitutions are NOT because the fries are lacking but because I want to try other things.   I called before picking up and it was ready immediately after I paid so I'm happy they were prompt.",

We arrived for brunch to celebrate the early-alcohol bill (better than before but still a bit backward at this day and age...) and the waiter wasn't aware of the time change, plus the actual alcohol selection was limited. I tried both the brunch cocktails and they were refreshing, but actually a little light on the booze.   The seafood paella was individually portioned which surprised me as I never see this dish available in small quantities. When it came out, it made sense, though. It was a tad bit undercooked in spots. The seafood was delish and the chorizo wasn't as bad an addition as I feared. They also were able to custom-add a poached egg or two on request. This almost made up for the undercooked bits.   The corn fritters appetizer wasn't anything special and I wished I had more options for a spread (savory and sweet butters would have been ideal). Probably wouldn't bother with that again, to conserve my calories and tummy space for more worthy options. Only one in three of the daily dessert shooters were good--the local peaches which actually tasted/felt like apples. The mocha mousse and lemon curd were ... unpleasant. Truly. Good crust base, though.  My understanding is those flavors change regularly so no telling if you'll have a similar or completely different experience. Gamble at your own risk. It was a fun and shareable crapshoot, at least, and we giggled quite a bit at how truly astringent the lemon curd was.   The server was friendly and made my companions feel just right, which I appreciated, but he was new to the restaurant and you could tell he just wasn't that familiar with the menu, the kitchen, and the policies. As the face of the place, this alone loses a full star for me.   Would I return? Yes. Would I order the seafood paella again? Yes. Will that be soon? No, I think I'll make the rounds and collect some other brunch touch points first.",

We had a 9pm reservation and they were running 15 minutes behind on getting us a table. With neither request nor hesitation, the hostess stated she would have the manager speak with us.  We were not expecting manager involvement over such a small delay, so it was a very pleasant surprise when she came to our table to offer a very sincere apology.  Additionally, 2 other staff members apologized for the wait, as well.  Throughout the entire evening, we observed excellent customer service.  No less than 4 staff members visited our table to bring food or take dishes away, showing a very strong teamwork policy.  The food was also very good. From the crab chowder to the squid chow chow to the shrimp & grits, everything was excellent.  All four of us commented on how good everything was. The environment was upscale but not stuffy. The whole experience was wonderful and we will certainly be back.",

The sea level oysters were delicious, slightly briny and small/medium in size. There was a selection of over 10 different oysters, a wide variety across the US and decently priced.   The host was friendly, the bartender was knowledgeable about the menu, and the oyster shucker gave me some great places to check out in town.  I'd say the clam chowder was pretty darn delicious and I'd recommend it.   There was a patio section outside which was pretty spacious and butted up to one of the main roads, or plenty of seating at the bar or in the dining space.  I'll be coming back here.",

Once we were seated, we started with tempura shrimp and corn fritters. The shrimp was incredible and a healthy portion for a starter. The corn fritters were fried perfectly and the dipping sauce was delicious. We ordered snapper that was cooked perfectly and a daily special. The salmon was also very good. A lively atmosphere and great food.",

    "text": "Adding to THE LIST! I was looking for charbroiled oysters coming from a trip to New Orleans and saw this restaurant had an impressive oyster menu. So I decided to stop in for an early dinner.  Located in a bit of a hidden spot in Uptown, right off of Tryon, with an entrance on 5th Street. I was immediately seated and the restaurant was still a little light at the time. My server Joe was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and very professional, but still friendly. No charbroiled oysters, so I tried the Oysters Noda. For my meal I had the catfish Ruben and substituted the fries for the braises greens.   The Oysters Noda were good. The bacon was a bit overpowering, but still good. The catfish Ruben was PHENOMENAL! The seasoned, grilled catfish, cheese and mix of flavors in the \"slaw\" were excellent. I even really like the flavor of the greens.   I will be back to try the fritters, shrimp steamed bun, lobster roll and fried catfish with grits.",

My husband and I couldn't choose between the shrimp po boy or lobster roll, so we ordered each and requested that each be cut in half so that we could share. Not only were they cut in half, but they split them and our sides on two plates for us! (Both were great...the lobster roll and corn fritters were my fave...the po boy and fries were my husband's faves.)  We ended our dinner with a white chocolate berry shooter dessert which was delicious and made from scratch in-house. Perfect touch to an already fab meal!",

I'm tired of the newer restaurants with the mini portions they serve. These were just right. Not too big and not too small. Had stone crab appetizer which was one of the specials of the day and the ceviche. Both really good. Husband had snapper linguine which was prepared perfectly! I had clam chowder and ceasar salad.

It was reasonably priced at $8/glass - nice crisp flavor with fruity hints.  I ordered 4 oysters, which were priced individually, and also the pick 3, which was 2 small plates and a side. I chose 2 \"Sweet Jesus\" oysters from ME and 2 Blue Point oysters from MD. Both were fresh and tasty. No overly fishy or salty taste to them.  For the pick 3, I chose the oyster slider, the fish taco, and the corn fritters. The oyster slider was a fried oyster with a slaw mix and a jalapeno cream drizzle. It was the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. The fish taco was amaze balls too. The fish was seasoned really well, and they didn't skimp on it either lol. The corn fritters were equally delicious - nice mix of sweetness and heat from the dipping sauce. Overall, it was a really great meal.  I did however wish that the oysters came out first instead of all together. It did seem to take awhile for everything to come out - I started snacking on the stale crackers that they bring out with the hot sauce and moist towelettes lol.",

Waiter brought our drinks then we didn't see him for quite some time. Finally another waiter brought our lobster rolls although very small, on a small hot dog roll was good along with the greens. Waiter came by, fill water and walked away. Came back later, ask if we wanted desert, came back with the bill. I flagged him down and asked about the up charges and he immediately asked did I want a manager. Manager took one off and charged half for the others. Lobster rolls are $24, although we're good not worth it . First time here, poor service, expensive small portions. Maybe just a poorly trained waiter made this a very bad experience.",

The oil sauce and vinegar pepper sauce were so good on the oysters and they come in cute little bottles.

The vibe is really cool - very farm-to-table, dimly lit, a hipster's paradise. Service was great but the food didn't hit it out of the park...maybe a base hit at best. We started with a dozen raw local oysters and the grouper ceviche. The Sea Level oysters were TINY...like barely there, shouldn't have been served kind of tiny. The restaurant touts that these oysters are brought in daily, and to that I'd say maybe daily isn't the way to go...let those puppies grow a few more days. I don't even know if that's how it works but just saying, if that's what you're naming your restaurant after, I would've hoped for a more impressive showing. The ceviche was good but a more apt name would've been jicama ceviche as there was far more of that than grouper. For entrees, the wife got the salmon with a side of grits and I got the NC paella. The salmon was cooked to order at a medium and the grits were extremely tasty (very balanced flavors and great texture), but the spiced chutney was way too spicy. The paella was served in a skillet, which automatically earns it a bonus point. who doesn't love a skillet presentation?? the protein to rice proportion was appropriate but overall the dish was on the dry side and didn't wow on the flavor front. So, all in all, everything was edible and nothing was terrible so there's that.",

I ordered the ribs plate and it was SO MUCH FOOD!  The meat fell straight off the bone and the potato salad was the best I've ever had. We had a dozen and a half oysters and the variety was great. My favorite dessert was the mint chocolate chip ice cream cake. The seasonal G&T was absolutely incredible. We were so pleased and will definitely be back.",

The corn fritters taste exactly like African puff puff, I tasted no corn but they were yummy. The restaurant is in an office building and it was very relaxed around 2pm. Most stars going to service because the hostess was amazing I went in during lunch and she went above and beyond even giving me an umbrella so I wouldn't have to walk in the rain or take an Uber to go down the street. Much appreciated. Highly recommend trying this restaurant during lunchtime.",

    "text": "Went to Sea Level with a work group.  We were not from the area and relied on previous reviews.  The majority of us ordered the lobster bisque which is the worst I've ever tasted to be honest.  The soup was more like a puree the same consistency as baby food with the tiniest bit of lobster as a garnish in the middle.  I shared the seafood paella and a lobster roll with a coworker.  Both were okay, not great.  The lobster roll was small and the lobster itself was over cooked.  The paella was very dry.  The rice stuck to the bottom of the dish and the mussels were very dry from being under a food heater I presume.  The server threw a tantrum when we asked for the alcohol to be separated from our food orders and proceeded to scold us for not asking the moment we sat down.  You press buttons on a computer screen.  Your life is not that difficult.  Relax.",

We arrived to the restaurant around 3 pm and I was so excited because the yelp reviews for this place looked really great. My friend and I ordered the fish punch which was really too lemony if you ask me. After disappearing for 15 minutes the server comes up to us and tells us they are not serving any food other than the raw bar and walked away. Then a nice server comes up to us 5 minutes later to check on us and inform us that he's now our server. WHATS???   That was the last straw for us. I just told him we needed the check. I felt a little bad because I got kinda snippy with him and it was not his fault so I explained to him why I was frustrated. While we were paying we noticed a burger and fries went past us and people were eating FULL meals as we walked out. Maybe they reset between 3 and 4 for dinner but someone should have explained that to us BEFORE we . This experience was horrible. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone.   Update: Never heard again from the owner despite correspondence via Yelp.",

Last night, I was catching an event at Blumenthal after work, so what better way to kill time than to finally check out Sea Level.  The place is very hip. LOVE the outside seating, although tonight, since I was solo solo, I went for oyster bar seating. It is somewhat small inside.  I ordered four sea level oysters (HOLLA for happy hour, where their Sea Level oysters are $1.00 each (vs. the regular price of $1.75 each). After tasting the first one with their special vinaigrette \"dressing\", I should have ordered WAY more. BUT, I knew I was getting a cocktail & a lobster roll, so wasn't trying to get ahead of myself & spend a lot of money.  Somehow my drink order got forgotten, but my waiter multi-tasked & fixed it for me. The oysters ... AMAZING. My cocktail was so delightful. The Maine style lobster roll was quite tasty & lobster a plenty. The cole slaw was really good, too.  Pricey, pricey! But all in all worth it. Oyster bar staff was fun to chat with & my waiter (can't remember any of their names!) was great, too.  Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "We are seafood lovers which is why we selected Sea Level. It was our first time there. We were promptly seated and our server came a bit slowly at first and took our drink orders.  The drinks were over what you might expect to pay for other uptown restaurants but very well made.   A very nice and well put together menu with an eclectic selection of seafood and non-seafood items including but not limited to various spins on Rubens and cheese-steaks. I ordered the fried oyster salad as an appetizer, with my main course as the shrimp and grits. Both very good. I took advantage of the Queen's feast menu. My daughter ordered the watermelon salad which was delicious but as a 'shareable' it was about 6 ounces of fruit served on a third of a salad plate. She also ordered the bowl of lobster bisque which although good was again a small portion perhaps 6-8 ounces that of which comes in at $13. My husband ordered a fried shrimp po-boy with fries which was also very good, but again might not be so feasible for a casual date night coming in at $24.  Service was a bit slow, but our server was very polite and had a great demeanor. After all was said and done, we didn't quite feel like we had a $180 meal. Overall atmosphere was new age and clean with many special touches. Perhaps go for lunch or a drink and appetizer kind of night but if you're hungry and lighter on the wallet, you may consider something with more bang for your buck if you're hungry.",

    "text": "We visited Sea Level before we went to see Trevor Noah. I didn't really have high expectations for the restaurant. It's right across the street from the theater and our friends wanted to check it out. I'm always down for new places so I decided to set up the reservations and make it happen. I'm not a huge fan of seafood, but the restaurant had a decent amount of \"land\" options. More importantly: they have corn fritters on the menu. That's how classy I am. I was down to go because of the corn fritters.   We arrived right on time for our reservations - they were on the early side so not many people were there yet. I really wish I remembered our waiters name because he was awesome. He checked in on us, joked with us, and genuinely cared about our experience. Part of why I liked the experience so much was because of him.  We ordered corn fritters, of course. They were so good. Not what I expected or was used to, but still legit. I also ordered a seasonal drink named, \"Thyme for a drink\". It was the perfect balance of sweet and fruity. I then ordered a burger and fries. I know, not original. But my boyfriend ordered fish and grits so he made up for my land order. More importantly, my friends husband ordered the paella. Holy cow. It looked amazing. Per his report: it tasted amazing. He even joked about getting another one for dessert.   Speaking of dessert, my boyfriend ordered the key lime ice cream sandwiches. He didn't finish them because the ice cream was extremely tart. I, on the other hand, ordered an apple-pie- bourbon-pecan concoction. I'm drooling about it now. My friend ordered the sundae and joked (but not really) about not sharing with us. We weren't even mad that she didn't because it was on the smaller side... and no one was going to even jokingly try to take it.  All in all, we had an extremely good time and were all pleasantly pleased with the restaurant. If you're seeing a snow, the location is very convenient... might as well make some reservations now!",

We came on a Friday night with bad weather out side but a huge positive was you don't even have to go outside to get to this place if you park in Hearst tower.  They validate too so you can park there for free.  Our friends were seated when we arrived right at the front door so a freezing draft hit us every time it opened, not that big a deal though.  So on to the food.  We ordered oysters, salmon tartar, a few different tacos, corn fritters, two lobster rolls and paella for one.  So I was the person that ordered the paella and thought that it would be tough to make it good with only say 15-20 minutes to prepare it and boy was I right.  They did a couple things correct, the bottom of the rice had the perfect amount of crust, the rice was cooked well as was the fish but there was just no flavor.  The dish needed salt, saffron, red pepper flakes and pepper.  There was no fresh herbs, no seasoning, no nothing.  So for $30 I got a decently cooked pan of rice, some white fish and shrimp.  The lobster rolls were tasty, very small but tasty, for $22 you would expect more but I am sensing a theme with this place.  We enjoyed the apps we had, solid, not spectacular.  The tartar and tacos are the way to go here, the entrees are overpriced and underwhelming.  The service was good.",

But our app arrived close to our entrees being finished. Our waiter seemed like more preoccupied watching the Kentucky Derby and the hockey game on TV, so half our time was spent waiting on our waiter and the other half was spent waiting on our food and eating.

Different this time but still sweet. I came in on a Saturday at 1:30pm and sat at the bar. It wasn't that busy which is great. I was worry because St Paddy Parade was in full force outside. Greeted by Blanca. She brought me water and the menu. My bartender/waitress Audrea was the one who serviced me thru out the time there and Blanca backup when needed. These ladies are what services are suppose to me. They were tentative. One glance at Audrea. And she understood that I need her. So here's what I ordered:  6 raw oyster, varied picked by Audrea Corn Fritters Fish taco Oyster Taco  Mini salad Shrimp cocktail 2 snow crab claws Po boy sandwich  5 blushing bubbles drinks (yes I'm a lush)   A friend of mine like raw oysters. I like steamed oysters but since they don't offer steamed.  the oysters goes to him.. seem like he enjoyed it. Slurped it up quick. And I sure enjoy watch the guy behind the bar shucking it. I'm in love with the corn fritters. Crispy in the outside and fairly soft in the inside. No sauce needed. I really enjoyed the fried oysters Taco.. the batter oysters was different in a Taco and I can say I had one and will come back for more. Definitely can't complain about the shrimp cocktail, just wish the plating will be slightly different. I ordered soo much food that eventually the shrimps was sitting in a pool of water after the ice melts. But hey it went down the same place. I never had the snow crab claws before so I must say it's a treat and no wonder it's $5. If I didn't order some much food. I would just order that all night with the blushing bubbles and the corn critters. My friend enjoyed the Po Boy but I'm guessing not so much the fish Taco because he didn't finish it.  Overall I'm glad I hit the reset button. This time around, service was sooo much better., the food was excellent. I enjoyed the quietness of the restaurant and the ambiance.",

    "text": "I can only speak for two of the things, but I like $1 oyster happy hours and glasses of chilled white wine so I'm satisfied. I like that the happy hour goes from 4 - 7 which gives me plenty of time to get my oyster fix (and apparently it goes from 10 - 12 as well...which just means more opportunities). The oysters were fine -- good and briny, but not as cleaned out as I liked, but hey, it's $1. It's a good after work hang out place when you want to wind down in Uptown.  The salmon tartare was also pretty good but I wish it came with more jalapenos or at least had them diced up so I could get a spicy kick in every bite. Not sure if I'll come back for an actual dinner, but I'll definitely keep doing the $1 oysters.",

    "text": "A group of my colleagues and I happened to be at Hearst Tower today and decided to try out Sea Level, a new restaurant located in the Hearst Tower that had just opened earlier this month.  On a Wednesday night, there were no reservations required as I think the restaurant is still fairly new and it's still pretty slow.  We were accommodated quickly.  I want to note that the service here, while a little bit slow, was great.  Our server was very friendly and there were always people asking us (a little too much sometimes) if we were done with our dish so they could clear it out.  Water was always full.  The GM also came over to chat and to make sure everything was alright, which we appreciated.  Prices are reasonable for seafood.  The food was a little lackluster... perhaps there are still a few kinks to sort out as this is such a new restaurant:  - No bread basket - you have to order it separately and it comes with a nice onion spread.  - Sea Level and Blue Point oysters - one of them, which I assume is the Sea Level, was itty bitty teeny tiny (I'm very small and have very small hands - see picture for scale) - literally smallest oyster I've ever seen.  However, both oysters were fresh (I haven't gotten sick!) and had a nice salty brine flavor.  Comes with all the condiments.  - Squid chow chow - we had no idea what a chow chow was and should have asked.  It's basically fried calamari tossed in peppers and onions in a sweet/spicy sauce.  It was really, really greasy and I felt like I was eating more batter than I was squid.  I had to spit out one that was all batter and no squid.  The flavors were good, though.  - Mussels - these were my favorite of the evening.  The sliced grilled baguettes went well with the butter/white wine/lemon sauce and the mussels were aplenty and fairly fresh.  I would recommend getting these!   - Lobster roll - unfortunately, both my coworker and I found lots of shell pieces in the lobster salad, which we both bit into.  My piece of shell was quite large and she had many little pieces in hers.  The GM was nice enough to comp both rolls, which was a nice gesture.  It's understandable that they might have some pieces of shell in them since they apparently get these really fresh and make their lobster salads on the spot, but it's still not an excuse - I've never had a shell problem with any lobster roll I've had.  The cole slaw had a nice pickled flavor to it, but I didn't eat much of it.  Overall, an okay place to have a dinner with colleagues as there is a lot of space and it's conveniently located in Hearst Tower, but I think there's still a few hiccups to remediate since it's so new.",

We also tried the tempura shrimp appetizer and sword fish, which both were great options.  But we will most definitely be back for that flounder.  The service was awesome just as we remembered it!    I had high expectations for this place, but...it just didn't meet up to the hype as much as I thought.  The best part of the meal was the SERVICE honestly...our waiter was excellent!!!  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and had the best attitude.  As far as the food goes, we weren't too impressed.  We ordered the clam chowder, catfish Ruben, and catfish with grits.  The one thing we would come back for is the clam chowder.  The Ruben was ok, but the catfish wasn't really fresh. The best thing was my side...the braised greens were awesome!  And all of this was very over-priced for the quantity...we left hungry.  We would probably only come back for appetizers and drinks with friends.",

I had a shrimp cocktail with plenty of obviously fresh NC shrimp and house-maid cocktail sauce that all tasted great. The swordfish entree was likewise perfect and came with a wonderful lobster risotto. The tempura shrimp was absolutely perfect, and we are pretty snobby about shrimp. A colleague had the mussels and raved about them as well as her fish juice punch drink. I cannot recommend this place enough. And I would be remiss if I did not mention the fantastic service we received from Nate; thanks for the great dinner.",

We ordered shrimp tempura, which definitely wasn't  a tempura batter, shrimp was a little iodiny. Corn fritters had hardly any corn to be found. They were bland. Good thing they came with a sauce. The Calamari chow chow would have been delicious if it  had not been so inedibly salty that we had to return them two times. The oysters were fresh and briny and delicious. They came with 2 types of mignonette and one of the bottles they came in was empty. A few of us ordered the veggie burger, which although it was good, it tasted like stuffing, not a veggie burger. It was made with sweet potatoes and topped with roasted tomatoes and caramelized onions and deep-fried with the tempura batter which the shrimp should've been battered with. It came with collards, too vinegary, and another side of sweet potatoes? Those were so good!! Really creamy and delicious! Dessert was the best part! Don't expect exceptional seafood here unless you're getting oysters. The end.",

Throughout the weekend I had the Lobster Roll, Clam Chowder and the Paella.  Being from Connecticut, I am very particular about my lobster roll...this did not disappoint.  It was one of the best I have ever had!  The clam chowder was great l and I can't even begin to describe how flavorful and just all around amazing the Paella was.  I am only a beer drinker but the cocktails that were made looked so good!  One of the best parts was the staff and their attentiveness to the patrons.  Jon and Scott were beyond personable and it was like I had known them for quite some time.  I want to thank the whole staff that I interacted with (I know I forgot a few) because you all made my trip to Charlotte even better.

The shrimp reminded me more of a deviled crab, but was really good. The fries were your typical run of the mill hand cut fries, which is just what I wanted.   My boyfriend got the shrimp po'boy with slaw. It was pretty good, no frills but that's exactly what he wanted, a good old fashioned po'boy.   We also tried the sea level oysters which run $1.75 normally but were on special for $1 (it's a happy hour thing from 4-7). They were delicious, easily worth $1 each.   The feel of the place was kind of hard to gauge because it was 4:30 on a Friday -- not very busy. I'd like to go back later one night to see how it feels at peak business hours. Also curious to see if the service suffers any when busy because it was top notch when I went.   I definitely plan to go back and definitely recommend this place!",

    "text": "Being COMPLETELY new to North Carolina, I was a bit skeptical about going to the number one ranked place for happy hour as I think that the best places usually aren't ranked number one.... and I suppose that that's still probably True as I didn't get to go to every happy hour hot spot... but I can say that this place was AWESOME!  We had a group of 5 of us... mixed eaters/drinker styles... we sat outside, which is honestly a strange place to be because you can't really make out wether you're inside or outside.... but anyway, here we were \"outside\", and our lovely server \"Kierrah\" greeted us... she's a major reason we had such a phenomenal experience... I'm not sure how the other servers are, but she was so absolutely incredible with service that I might be disappointed if I returned and it wasn't her.  Anyways, they update their menu very frequently. And the first thing I noticed was that they had two cocktail options that were charitable. If you bought one of these $10 cocktails, the business would donate $5 to Hurricane Irma efforts. Superb. I love it.  There were, however, much more attractive cocktail options to me that were so unique and creative that I had to give them a try. I loved them and tried my friends' and loved theirs too. Major props.  My friends were super stoked about the $1 oyster happy hour special and everyone enjoyed the different food they ordered... wait just kidding, my boyfriend wasn't a fan of the shrimp poboy that he ordered (but he's French and super picky)... anyways, everyone else was happy! I believe a Reuben, tartare, and clam chowder were ordered.  Great place to stop for drinks and meet up with people!  The music was GREAT!!!! I nearly forgot! And that was one of the reasons I was okay with stopping here! You can always tell a lot by a places taste in music.",

All dinners were generous in portion and flavorful.  The only reason I'm not giving Sea Level 5 stars is due to the fact that they up charged $3 for ice cubes for each of our cocktails.  $3 for an ice cube-seriously???  I ordered a Johnny Black on the rocks and my son a Bourbon on the rocks and both were charged for the ice.  Either tell us up front there is a charge for Ice or bury that charge in the cost of the drink.  Just not cool.",

The shrimp po boy (which is a classic southern dish and I'm a classic southerner) was not the over flowing small golden brown shrimp on a soft roll. Instead it was these heavenly breaded large over cooked shrimp on this giant dense roll. I'm a purest so maybe some ppl like this but it's not the traditional sandwich. They also have a \"rueben\" on the menu that was recommended to me by the server. I said I don't care for thousand island/Russian dressing and she stated it didn't come with that...again a classic sandwich without the classic details (and seafood and cheese..no).  The positives are the atmosphere and the salads. My friend got the apple and endive with salmon and raved about it. I'll try this place again but I will come at night when I can try some of their cocktails. Cocktails without soda b/c their selection is from a local company and let's just say they skimp on the carbonation.",

Go ahead and stir that extra horseradish they bring you in and enjoy the burn!  My wife had the key lime iced cream cookie and it was also very tasty.  The drinks were pricy.

I can't stand it when you walk into a place and the host acts like she doesn't see you and then when you try and get her attention she gives you a rude snippy response. A smile, and \"I'll be right with you,\" would have been great .. instead we started our dinner with her snotty attitude. At any rate, the person who seated us and our waiter made up for the rude hostess. We both had specialty drinks - Manhattan and old fashioned, both sub par. (Menu indicates a luxardo cherry in my manhattan which is always appreciated but what i got was not a luxardo). We tried the chicken bao which was so delicious we almost got another. The ceviche was OK, it needed some more tang/lime. It bothered me that the leafy green it came with had all kinds of holes in it... but moving on, we shared the lobster roll and swordfish over a lobster risotto. Lobster roll was also ok, nothing to write home about. Swordfish on the first attempt came out with undercooked rice which we couldn't deal with since undercooked rice definitely causes stomach aches. The waiter gladly took it back and apologized. It came back, still slightly undercooked but fine. It just took away from this creamyness that you look forward to with risotto. The swordfish was also just ok, a little over cooked in my opinion and lacked flavor. We were really hoping to be blown away by this place but instead were left a little disappointed.",

I recommend parking in the Hearst Plaza, where the restaurant is located. The restaurant offers 3 hours validation for dinner and 2 hours for lunch. Our server Mike was super friendly and great!!

The food was delicious the taco was juicy and had tons of flavors, my absolute favorite was the shrimp steam bun sandwich that was AMAZING the grits we're a little gritty definitely not the old southern grits you get from Mom's or gma so it's an acquired taste and could have probably used so cheese in the grits.. that was one of my only gripes..

Get to the restaurant at 8:10 and there's a ton of confusion on the reservation. Turns out they seated another party of 6 that had a similar name but was an hour late for their reservation. Neither hostess was apologetic about their mistake but by this time it was pushing 8:30 so we waited while they attempted to find us different available tables.   Finally one of the front of house managers, Andrew, stepped in and got us seated in a nice booth. He brought all but one of the appetizers on their menu for no charge to our table and all of the food was great. Entrees and cocktails were served quickly and tasted equally as good. Mistakes happen which is fine but in food and bev, your attitude makes a world of difference. Andrew was amazing in making up for everything. He's really the reason for the 4 star review.",

    "text": "Sea Level's entrees are where it's at. The oysters are a bonus. The sides, you can do without. The menu is constantly changing so take the menu on their website with a grain of salt.  The swordfish ($33) was perfectly cooked served with brussel sprouts, carrots, pecans, a vinaigrette, and topped with fried onions. Surprisingly the flavors melded well and the meal left me satisfied but not overstuffed. My fellow diners ordered the grilled salmon ($25), which was decent. Though my fellow diner who ordered the paella ($30) absolutely killed it and left the cast iron it was served in absolutely spotless!  We also ordered 3 Sea Level oysters ($1.75)/each), flavorful but much smaller than the Delaware Bay, NJ oysters ($2.50) which were ginormous and silky smooth but didn't have much flavor. The sauce accompaniments were plentiful: horseradish, red vinegar, onion/oil/pepper, cocktail sauce, and lemon!  The salmon tartare ($12) had dill aioli and jalapenos, served with charred bread. Not my favorite flavors for a salmon tartare. The sides: tater tots ($5)(perfectly fried and filling!), roasted root vegetables, steamed pork belly ($5.50/each)(stay away!), and duck tacos ($5.50/each)(too saucy) were all forgettable compared to the mains.  Sea Level NC tries to be a cool fusion restaurant with Asian/Mexican flavors like \"pork belly steamed buns\" and \"duck tacos\" while serving up fresh seafood but it should really just focus on the seafood. Decent for a business meal but falls short of being on a regular's list.   Service was quite nice though instead of checking my reservation for 4, the maitre'd assumed I was a party of 2 since I had arrived early with only one fellow diner. I really appreciated that our server helped us fill our glasses because we were seated in a deep booth while the water was at the other end of the table. Sea Level is nestled between a parking garage and in the side of an office building, with a dark/awkward outdoor seating but once inside has rustic feel with the exposed ceiling, hightops, booths, and brick walls.",

Everyone enjoyed the oysters and the 3 small vials of house made sauces we all very good. In addition to the oysters one of my friends ordered an old fashioned which he described as \"one of the best he has had in Uptown\".

So we had fried, Washington State raw and their version of Rockefeller. All three outstanding, the raw were fat and creamy.

Moving on to the food (that's why we came right?). I can't possibly describe how good it was. I had the corn fritters and my girlfriend had a half dozen oysters as an app. Both were great. For an entree I had the paella and it was hands down one of the best seafood meals I've ever had.

    "text": "As we continue our gastronomic tour through Charlotte--with a number of positive surprises--we had lunch today at Sea Level, and once again were not disappointed.  This restaurant just brings it all together: a \"top 25 new restaurant\" designee in Charlotte Magazine,it has a great story of someone pursuing their dream. Even the website brings you \"in\", and the restaurant itself is inviting: sophisticated without being overwhelming, clean lines, a menu that reflects a philosophy, and food/service to match. There is even a nod to their fundraising activities for hurricane victims and various local causes they support.  The menu has some tempting offerings, however we started with the \"special\" oysters (they were out of their own sustainably sourced shellfish when we were there). However, not disappointed with the \"substitutes\" from Virginia, which were even better at $1 each (happy hour, on Saturday afternoon). We coupled that with the salmon tartare and crostini (our habit is to order what we are interested in. That doesn't mean we finish everything!!!! Sometimes tasting is sufficient. Well, maybe a bit more than a \"taste...)  For the main course, Sandra had the po boy with fried shrimp and oysters (on request, they were glad to offer both) and I had the catfish Reuben (who ever thought of catfish on a Reuben? Well, this IS North Carolina, not New York). Remember that comment about tasting? Limits were difficult to enforce with either. Guess that says something about how much we enjoyed them. Oh, and the \"side orders\" of french fries and grits with chorizo gravy were generous and delicious.  So, Charleston: you continue to surprise us with the number of well-executed downtown eating and entertainment/sports/theater options you offer to us visiting folks. You have made our visit fun and delicious. And most of all we heard again and again from visitors and locals alike: everyone seems to love this city!!! We certainly understand why, especially with restaurants like this and the others we have visited this week. They are more than enjoyable; they are ambassadors in the very best sense of the word.",

    "text": "Sea Level is one of my favorite new restaurants in Charlotte. I've been in a couple of times with my boyfriend and so far we've tried the shrimp po-boy, catfish reuben, lobster roll, and $1 Sea level oysters. Everything was delicious, but the catfish reuben was the real stand out dish. The sandwiches all come with french fries, which are really tasty. The lobster roll could use a little more butter drizzled on top, but that's my only critique of the food so far.   What I really love about Sea Level is that it seems to strike a great balance of semi-fine dining, while also being casual, if that's what your mood is. To that end, there's a big patio, and a good bit of bar seating, so even on a busy weekend evening, you may be able to be seated without a reservation at one of the aforementioned locations. Additionally, the service is fabulous. The servers are very professional - They know their stuff and they ensure patrons have a great dining experience. Finally, I love that there are cheaper options (i.e. $2 beer, $5 house wines, ~$12 sandwiches, and $1 oysters), and there are plenty of high quality, more expensive options as well. You really can achieve whatever dining experience you are looking for at Sea Level, whether is be a nice date, casual happy hour drinks and oysters, or somewhere in between!",

    "text": "Amazing food. Solid start to the service with a miserable finish.   My wife and I went to Sea Level on Saturday night 2/4. When we walked in around 8, the restaurant was very busy, but no one was waiting to be seated. 2 spots opened up at the oyster bar and we went and sat down.   Our waiter (one of the bartenders) came over pretty quickly, took a drink and appetizer order and went off to take care of the rest of his tables. During his few visits back to our table, he was knowledgeable, gave great recommendations, and helped us with anything we needed.   It was after our initial order that service started to suffer. The time between ordering something (my wife and I decided to do small plates) and receiving your order increased throughout our meal. We initially had to wait about 5 minutes for a hot dish and 5 or so minutes for Oysters. After a few dishes, we ordered the squid chow chow, waited for about 25 minutes and finally the manager came over to tell us the kitchen was running behind and that she would comp the squid chow chow off of our bill...this never occurred.  We ordered some of the buns and a final two oysters for my wife. At this point, our waiter was well into the weeds and hadn't visited our table for at least 15 minutes. The new bottle of water had been forgotten, and the final two oysters my wife had wanted to order had never been called in.   Our waiter visited and at this point in the night and we asked for the check (we had to ask someone else to get our waiter's attention). We figured the missing oysters would be more trouble than they were worth (as long as they weren't on the bill). Our waiter went away again to get our check. Between him printing our check and delivering it to us, I watched him make 2 drinks, deliver them, and run some food. Total time before asking for the check and receiving it? 10 minutes. The squid chow chow the manager said she'd comp? Not comped and at this point we were just ready to go. We signed the bill and left.  The food at Sea Level was great. The Squid Chow Chow is a must try as well as the mussels in the garlic wine sauce.   The service could have been much better. We weren't comped something that was promised, we had an order disappear into the ether, and it became increasingly difficult to get served.",

    "text": "Fantastic. Great quality fish, good service, good location, great patio, well made drinks, and an oyster happy hour that would've made me as happy as a clam.   I made the decision Friday night that I wanted seafood, and Sea Level is my closest place. Made a Yelp reservation for 2 at 7:30, and we parked in the labyrinth of the Hearst Tower deck (which they validate, regardless of event parking!!). Show up, and turns out we didn't need a reservation! The Lady and I were seated in the patio, but most of it touches Hearst Plaza which doesn't have the traffic or construction noises. Our server was kind and quick to offer suggestions, and we both started out with a drink. The Lady got the Meow Mule and I ordered the Smokey Old Fashioned, which was perfectly smoked in every sip.   To start, we got two Oyster Steamed Buns, which have a fried oyster for a good crunch. For our entrees, we knew we wanted fresh, so we splurged a little and got two of the fresh catch entrees; one Triggerfish, and one Snapper. As soon as these came out, we could tell how much work was put into the plates. The Triggerfish was sweet and tasted of crab (because, as our server explained, that's what it feeds off of) and the snapper had crispy skin and flaky flesh, just perfectly cooked. Each were served with it's own side dish, the Trigger wish a creole rice and slaw mixture, and the Snapper with a southern succotash that was stellar.   The menu changes daily, which means that they always provide the freshest catch. Prices are definitely a nice occasion with entrees hovering around the $30 range (and then you got drinks and apps and yada yada), but if you know that walking in, you're good. Unless you go for the oyster happy hour, then you can get out cheap :)",

I loved the ceviche, the added pear and the marinate gave it a sweeter flavor.  The lemon tart was light and excellent.  The main course is a white fish with a Thai red curry noddles.  The fish is fine but the noddle is too oily and bland.  My husband had salmon tartare and the fried trout.  He liked the tartare but was not impressed with the trout.   The service was great and our waitress was attentive and courteous.  The ambiance is relaxed and lively.   I will probably give it another try if I am in the area.",

We asked for extra bread after finishing the mussels to keep soaking. They had a $6 Stone Crab Claw special as well that we had--very good!   For entrees we did the NC Amberjack with herbed new potato mash, tarragon aioli and mixed veggies. We also did the Grilled Salmon with roasted potatoes, braised collards, smoked vinegar and herb aioli. Both were incredible--highly recommend!   For dessert we did the Cast Iron Apple Buckle and were fighting over who got the last bite!  All of the food was incredible. The price is exactly what they should be charging for delicious food with big portions! Atmosphere is classy casual and service was a 10 out of 10.",

The oysters were in decent size and very fresh. For appetizers we ordered shrimp steamed bun which turned out to be more like sliders - great portion and well seasoned. The entrees however, were a little disappointing. We had Trigger and Cobia since these were not the typical fish you see in a home cooked dinner. The veggies in both dishes were wayyyyy too salty we had to drink the whole bottle of water to finish the food. The trigger was breaded and fried, very greasy and salty as well. The cobia was cooked well but a little fishy in my opinion. The check was $80 which was not too bad but could have being spent on better tasted food. Won't come back unless for happy hour.",

The fries were too crispy for my liking so we replaced those with the corn fritters and were more than satisfied! The signature cocktails are the main event so I would recommend anyone to stop there for drinks. Overall, a great place to socialize with a great (but pricier) menu.",

Us girls decided to try out a few of the unique cocktails and were not disappointed. The cocktails were all delicious and a little twist on some classic drinks. We went around the holiday and the holiday punch with titos vodka and house made cranberry juice was my favorite.   For dinner there is a selection of both land and sea options, we all elected for the sea options, it is called sea level after all! I would consider myself a shrimp and grits expert and always order it if I see it on a menu, the shrimp and grits at sea level did not disappoint! I want to go back to order them again ASAP. My friend got the grilled salmon and I can only assume it was delicious because it was gone before I could ask for a bite!   Can't wait to go back!",

We ordered small plates for dinner, but had no complaints on anything. The duck taco was great, but the clam chowder was my favorite! My boyfriend ordered Caesar salad with salmon and LOVED it.

Waiter mentioned how oysters are $1.00 on Saturdays.  I ordered a dozen cause it was SATURDAY.  The bill came back including $46 of the $150 bill was for 12 oysters - NOT HAPPY!  Waiter went to talk with manager and came back to me saying there was nothing they could do because the $1 oysters were only for the ones from their farm.  This was never mentioned. Very deceptive.

(Tip: Make sure to keep your parking deck ticket for validation)  Cons: Some of the dishes were fairly salty even for seafood.  Pros: The mussels were pretty good. I enjoyed soaking my slices of toasted baguette into the sauce. The tempura shrimp and tuna tartare were also good. My favorite thing would have to be the oysters! Although they were smaller than I'm used to, they were flavorful and not gritty like some places. They literally melted in my mouth!!! Lastly, great ambience!!!  Aside from the food, one thing that will make me a loyal patron is their service. My friend had arrived early for our date. She sat inside and ordered like 5-6 dishes. When I arrived with my aunt, I sat on the patio and got drinks not knowing my friend was already at the restaurant. Because the weather was so good I convinced her to join me on the patio. When I asked the staff if they could move all her food over to the outdoor patio, they did not even bat an eye! They did it with smiling faces and had no hesitation in accommodating us. That is superior customer service! My aunt has already recommended this place to her friends!",

But the kitchen was sloppy and did not follow our requests to leave sauce on the side in the case of the too sweet squid chow chow (fried calamari) or warm  the mediocre apple tart. Way oversalting the greens was also a fault in the kitchen. Service not bad, but the restaurant gets super loud when full as it is all hard surfaces.",

I always like to compliment a good wait staff and this one is easy. Johnny on the spot, pleasant with just the right amount of chit chat.

My husband got the duck salad which he said was pretty good. I got the Caesar salad with blackened shrimp. The lettuce in my salad was browned and clearly not fresh. Don't serve vegetables that are clearly old! On top of that, the croutons are extremely sweet and didn't mesh with the salad and shrimp.   I probably wouldn't go back. I've had better tacos at Bakersfield, and overall better seafood elsewhere. It's also kind of hidden away...not the most ideal location.",

Made reservations for 2 which was a breeze, call me old fashioned but I called to make them.  CIAA was going on uptown and parking at the Hearst Tower was $20 FREAKING DOLLARS!  No worries as Sea Level validates.  Wonderful.  The place itself is well done.  Lots of seating and well decorated. They have the board listing the oysters of the day as well as a slide show on the TV showing the daily catch.  In this day and age of \"local\" and \"farm fresh\" this is great to see.    Nate was our waiter.  He was excellent.  He explained everything, and the thing that impressed me was that they change the one menu daily.  Fresh oysters, fish and other fare.  He was attentive and the rest of the staff supported him so no beat was missed  We started out with the salmon tartare.  Wow.  It was amazingly put together.  Pickled onions, peppers, little avocado, crema all came together for a great experience.  I do think it should be served with crostini or something to top it off.  I had the SC Grouper.  Served with bits of lobster, shaved asparagus, and a wonderful gnocchi.  Grouper was cooked to perfection and was just the right portion size.  The dishwasher had very little to do.    Sweetie had the salmon which is on the \"regular\" menu.  She ate all of it also.  I tried the salmon and it was tasty.  The rice which was some sort of Thai rice was amazing.  It takes real talent to make rice like that so kudos to the Chef.  We finished up with the Chef's grandmas cheesecake.  Yelpers, I eat a lot of cheesecake unfortunately, and this was one of the best.  Raspberry compote on the top pulled it all together.    I'll be back to Sea Level.  Probably with my friends that oysters.  They have a Oyster Happy Hour with $1.00 Oysters from like 4:00 - 7:00 (Check that since I'm not sure).    LOVE IT!!!",

With out question my friends and I wrapped up our hookah, finished our drinks and headed to Sea Level at 11:40pm. We literally walked in the door at 11:53 and asked immediately if we could still order! The guys said YES But you need to hurry we're about to shut down. My friends and I each ordered our own plate of oysters and OH MY GOSH! What yummy deliciousness it was. The oysters were so fresh and they had great toppings to add. I used all of mine thanks to my bar neighbor who helped me dress my oysters up all nice and pretty.   Even though Sea Level was closing they took the time to serve me and my friends until midnight as stated on their hours of operations sign. Typically restaurants try to turn you away the last 15 and some times 30 minutes before closing. But not this location! They were happy to take care of us and did it was a smile and very pleasant. I appreciate your hospitality and kindness Sea Level! Keep that up and you all will remain one of the top late night spots in my books for CLT and many others!",

Yet, I left the experience feeling like Sea Level is a restaurant that's still working out the kinks AND I still want to go back.   Likes: - 2 oyster happy hours; 4-7pm and 10 p - midnight  - Great fresh sustainable seafood  - Validated parking in the Hearst Tower - Great bar centric atmosphere with semi-open kitchen - Experienced great customer service after issue was brought to management's attention (received $10 gift cards...nice perk)  Room for improvement: - Front of house management- quite a bit of bottle-neck in small waiting area - Our specific waitress' attitude left much to be desired when order mistakes were brought to her attention  - SLOW service...about 1 hour to get food (in fairness, it was restaurant week, so this may have affected service)  I'm looking forward to an improved experience next time!",

The food was just as fresh and delicious.  The oysters were great, and this is one of the only places that we will trust to serve us raw oysters.  I had the steamed buns and they were awesome.  I actually made a meal of the apps, because they were all so good.  Love the concept and conscience of the restaurant.   My only criticism is that it is very loud.  The restaurant was very busy, and partly because there are no soft surfaces in the restaurant, it was exceptionally noisy and the noise was harsh on the ears.  They should consider putting up draping fabrics in the ceiling, wall hangings that would absorb sound, anything will help.  One other crticism, the floor needs to be cleaned better.  whomever you are hiring to do the cleaning is not doing you a good service.",

I was disappointed when my salmon arrived looking like something I'd have prepared with Kroger ingredients. It was overcooked and under seasoned. The beans were mushy and the potatoes were too crispy. It was definitely not a $29 meal! My husband had the shrimp and grits and said it was bland. Again, it wasn't worth the cost at all.   I liked the cocktails and the appetizers and would have liked to have tried others. The desserts were just sad.... I'd expected to see something special, but was let down with our cookies and chocolate cake.   Our server was nice and very attentive for a somewhat busy night. At one point he said there was a computer issue delaying our food, which bummed us out to start, and the food wasn't worth the wait.

    "text": "Amazing place. Ate the Sea Level raw oysters (raised on a private farm for these restaurants) for the first time in 15 years and it was outstanding. Also had the baked oysters and fried oyster taco which were top notch and tasty and zero fishy taste.   The shrimp appetizer (the signature dish) was over the top tasty and perfection.   We enjoyed a house punch (very sweet but she enjoyed it) and a Smokey old fashioned which was the best I've ever had.   We came back the second night and enjoyed mussels and one of the fish dishes (i forget the name!). Home run again.   Overall an awesome place and vibe with REALLY REALLY great food.",

    "text": "Wow! Nicely surprised in a couple of ways!  1) location - awesome and convenient - right across from Belk Theater  2) decor/vibe - really pulls you in - felt like I had been transported from the busy city  After a great show at the Belk, it was a no brainer to come here for some light post theater eats.  Sam was a pro - he greeted us, asked if we had been before and offered to guide us through the menu. We decided to sit outside as the weather was perfect even though the music was bit loud and clubby.  After a couple of Jam Session drafts our food was brought out. What we tried:  Corn Fritters - a full size portion is eight - they are dense, crispy and have a little pop of fresh corn flavor - totally addictive.  Tempura Shrimp - very big portion of tempura battered shrimp drizzled with their spicy aioli - no tails or veins to mess with - just lots of tender pieces of shrimp.  Fish Taco - I'd have to say the best thing we ate - just well balanced flavors with a light char/grill marks on the fish pieces - I could have eaten 2-3 more!  What I didn't like - not much - this place is pretty dope - definitely want to go back for Oyster Happy Hour - my only advice would be to switch up some of the sauces. The spicy Aioli was served with two of the dishes - would have preferred at least one of them was vinegar or citrus based - a little acid to take away some of the heavy/ greasy feel you get from deep fried starters. Just my two cents. Otherwise big fan!!!",

The service is terrific, probably the best I've had in Charlotte. I have come here twice and both times it has been amazing.  The first time I went the waiter took the time and explained all the different kind of oysters and the flavor profile you would expect to get with each different kind of oyster. It was very incite full and I could tasty exactly what I was suppose to.   I also had the fish of the day and it was cooked perfectly. It has excellent seafood selection and I love how it changes daily depending on what is fresh. I look forward to my next visit.",

Been there a few times, mostly for dinner but also for brunch and have walked away quite happy after each meal with the most recent visit being this week for a bday dinner with my oldest and his girlfriend.  Before some specifics on this most recent meal, my general commentary is that I really like Sea Level overall.  Food, service, cocktail choices, the way the menu has some standards but also is updated daily based on what's come in fresh, the 4-7 oyster happy hour where their Sea Level farmed variety are $1 each.  This time the table went for some apps... Oysters, tempura shrimp, clam chowder and crudo which may have been snapper but can't recall.  Do recall it was fresh and good.  Entrees varied from salmon, tile fish and shrimp and grits off the daily menu and a lobster roll from the everyday menu.  All was polished off amid compliments like, \"yum\", \"this is delicious\", etc.  Service was outstanding as it has been every time we've been.  They've got call ahead seating, take reservations via Yelp and you can order online for pickup.  Oh and park in the Hearst Tower garage and they'll validate before you leave the restaurant. Enjoy!",

    "text": "You had me at Sea...  I had the chance to visit this new seafood spot many times since its opening, and I'm loving everything Sea Level has to offer.  Here's everything you need to know from the Sea to the Level...  Parking:  Due to the fact that Sea Level is located in the heart of uptown Charlotte, there is no lot exclusively for Sea Level's patrons.  No matter, there are plenty of paid parking garages throughout the area.  I recommend parking in the one directly attached to Sea Level.  Don't worry about paying for parking, Sea Level validates parking here, so remember to bring your parking ticket with you!  Just ask the hostess on your way out and you're good.    Ambiance:  Upon walking in, I was struck by the streamlined, sleek feel of Sea Level.  It felt like an iPhone store turned restaurant.  Not that it was full of a bunch of technology, gadgets, or gizmos, but because the server kiosks are all hidden, and all the shelving is kind of built into the walls.  The hardwood floors seem to add a nice homey feel as well.  Food:  Awesome.  I had a chance to order the mussels.  Although they came out somewhat lukewarm, not hot, I thought the broth was very flavorful and I would def order them again.  No trip to Sea Level would be complete without a few oysters, so 6 oysters from the raw bar it is - 3 Sea Level and 3 Sweet Jesus.  I wasn't a huge fan of the Sea Levels, however the Sweet Jesus oysters were very succulent. Other menu items I've sampled include the fish tacos which were awesome, and I would def recommend.  I've also had the fried oyster taco, which I did not enjoy as much.  I know they have the shrimp and grits listed as an app, but it also work well as an entree if your not to hungry - tasty but not spicy.    Sea Level is a welcomed addition to the limited Charlotte seafood scene.  PS:  Don't forget to take advantage of the weekday Happy Hour they have.  They always have  select oysters for $1/oyster!",

They do validate parking if you park in the designated parking garage and be sure to take your parking ticket inside. (Your parking is validated for 3hrs from the time you enter the garage, which is perfect if you wish to go the local bars right outside after getting a bite to eat) In regards to the food, I can't really give a full review because I just ordered a simple lobster roll, therefore it was not that special and I did come across a couple of pieces of lobster shell in my roll and the bread was on the soggy side which through off my appetite. I would recommend to try something else from the menu but the pricing of the items could be a bit better.",

The seafood was so delicious, the service was impeccable and how convenient to be in the heart of uptown, just short walk from the light rail! Our experience was extra pleasant due to the 80 degree weather that afternoon. My husband & I indulged in a seafood feast that we can't stop talking about: Happy hour oysters, Squid Chow Chow, Fried Oyster Tacos & dessert. A couple of our orders took longer than usual to arrive at our table and the servers noticed without us having to complain. They were so efficient that they comp'd those items for us before we could even think to feel disappointed. That earns them 5 stars in my book! Fantastic Customer service AND Delicious food!

There is a nice outdoor porch area and you enter right beside the bar. There are all kind of unique decorations, and the interior was smaller than I expected, but still plenty of seating.  As for the food, everything was DELICIOUS! I started off with a half dozen raw oysters. Like the interior of the restaurant, smaller than I expected, but their house-made cocktail sauce was fantastic. The fresh \"local\" catch was red snapper. I love seafood in general, but snapper in unique because it is not very fishy so to speak. It was served over a jalapeno gazpacho, shitaake rice, vegetables, and kimchi slaw. So good mixing the different flavors. I am not much of a restaurant dessert person, but when it's included with the dinner price, what the hay? I chose the cinnamon sugar eclair and my head immediately EXPLODED! So good again.  I also had a \"fancy beverage\" as my wife calls them. The Smoked Old Fashioned was delicious. One large cube of ice with Makers Mark, hickory smoke, and bitters. You could smell the hickory as the drink arrived and gave the drink fantastic flavor. I would definitely recommend Sea Level for Queen's Feast (and special occasions as the menu is a bit above our normal price range, but also well worth it).",

We had sat there for a few minutes and we're still looking for the menu when the server came over to apologize for not coming over probably. The server, Mike, quickly put an appetizer complementary for us for the \"inconvenience\". He then went to go get our drinks which were absolutely phenomenal. Some of the best drinks I've had in my life - and I was a bartender in college. The food was spectacular everything was fresh hot and cooked to perfection. Recommendations were delicious and I can't wait to go back. There were so many things on the menu that I wanted. $140 for a meal and worth every penny.",

Everything about the place and their menu is top notch and great eats. I'd give it 5 stars alone for that.  But the service we experienced last night was garbage. Absolute garbage. I'll do bullet points to save on the fluff: - As a party of 7, a couple of people in our group only managed to get one drink ordered (alcohol), and the rest of the time we had to flag the guy down to get more after patiently waiting since it was starting to get crowded. - When we did manage to get his attention after waiting for long enough, he directly told our table \"wait a minute\", in a rude and gruff voice and didn't even stop to explain it, cutting me off when I was trying to explain myself. - He was waiting on people at the bar in an area that's clearly run by the bartender. - He was more fixated and chatting up the table next to ours, which coincidentally happened to be all women. - Multiple times, when I was sitting out menus for my friends to join me, he'd deliberately come back and put them back in between the salt and pepper shaker. Not once. MULTIPLE times.  There was nothing inviting about him, we had to wait forever to order more drinks, and when we couldn't, and tried to politely get his attention, he'd brush us off without so much as a word out of our mouths. I don't ever make a scene in a restaurant or ask for a manager, but the service was literally so bad I almost went to the manager and had them deduct our automatic gratuity. I don't know if he was just in a bad mood, or if he thought that because his tip was going to be automatically included that he could just get away with doing a pretty poor job...but that kind of attitude needs to be left at the door, not at work where you're trying to make people feel welcome.  So kudos to Sea Level for the amazing cuisine and super fresh oysters, but if I were to go back, I'd turn around and walk out if I saw the same guy working.",

On this occasion, we went during Queen's Feast and ordered off the Queen's Feast menu.  My husband had the oyster appetizer and I ordered the ceviche.  The oysters were unusually small and the ceviche was disappointing.  For entrees, he had the catfish served on a bed of creamed corn polenta that he said was good and I had the short rib with summer squash.  The tarragon sauce served with the vegetables was surprisingly delicious because I didn't think I'd like tarragon and the short rib was, as usual, tenderorni and excellent.  For the dessert, we both had the bourbon chocolate pound cake which was ok.  The reason for four stars is more about the Queen's Feast menu than the restaurant.  Yes, you get to sample some of the quality menu items at a reduced price ($35 each). But the servings are just \"samples\" or what my husband calls \"Froo-Froo\" (i.e. pretty on the plate but less than filling).  Ok for me, but I'm a small eater.  As always, the service was excellent, but next time, we'll order from the regular menu.  It might even cost a little more for him, less for me so it will average out.  But, he won't have to eat again when we get back home.",

Although they were on the small side they were incredibly fresh with just enough salt to satisfy. Woods was our bartender and was incredibly personable and knowledgable. He made us their vodka infused oyster shooter and it had to be one of the best we've had. Hints of pickle juice and a subtle smokiness and heat in the back end. Highly recommend. Have woods make you a drink and take advantage of the happy hour oysters. You won't be disappointed.",

The servers were super sweet (and cute too!) and perfectly attentive.  We ordered a couple of beers and apps to start.  I especially liked the corn fritters.  The shrimp tempura was a little too fried for my taste - but pretty good.  We ordered the oysters - cause you have to :) - which were delish - and then we did our main meal.  I had the Catfish Reuben and it was so good!  I got a side of carrots, which sounded sorta boring, but I was trying to be healthy :).  The carrots came out in a little pot and were deliciously grilled - surprisingly good!  I would have liked to have a bit more slaw on my plate with he sandwich, but otherwise was happy.  Everyone loved their meals - one girlfriend got the Lobster roll, which was insanely delish.  The soft shell crab sandwich was the slight disappointment as it was a bit too fried for my friend's taste.  We had the apple tart for dessert - and so should you - awesome!  Overall it was a great experience, fun way to start off the night and I will definitely be back.",

As for entrees at our table - lobster roll, catfish reuben, and risotto. My friend from Massachusetts had the lobster roll and gave it the seal of approval. The catfish reuben was amazing, and the risotto got a good review.  All in all I am so excited to have this place uptown and will be a frequent visitor! Price is really reasonable also.",

I've waited a bit as I'm reluctant to try places when they first open so they could work out the kinks. My husband and I gave it a shot tonight.   We Ordered our drinks and the corn fritters and a bowl of the clam chowder to start. The corn fritters were just ok. They were a bit dry  but the aioli was delicious with a nice kick. The clam chowder was good but $9 for a small bowl is outrageous. It didn't even come with bread or crackers or anything.   For dinner I got the tile fish which was just ok. It wasn't cooked right and lacked flavor. My husband ordered the lobster roll which was again just ok and I thought dry and lacking flavor. I wouldn't go back for any of the items we had.   Another peeve was the waitress asked us if we wanted dessert while we were still eating. We politely declined and said not yet. Five minutes later she brought our check. We would have gotten another drink and possibly dessert after we were done eating our dinner but felt rushed out at that point and just decided to leave.   I think this place has great potential if it listens to the reviews and works out the service kinks.",

Their decor is modern and understated stylish. Lots of exposed brick and wood. It appeared to be a place where food and drinks should be the star. And that was indeed what we found !    They have a incredible farm to fork raw oyster menu. It changes constantly depending on the season and what's available. We had a dozen of mixed oysters. All fresh and delectable. Washed them down with a  craft cocktail called Melting NY Sour. It was what my husband called a \"man's drink\".    The clam chowder was literally overflowing with fresh clams in a flavorful thick soup chowder. Next up were their mussels. Plump and tasty. Mussel rule #108  don't forget to use the bread for sopping up the mussel broth!   Shrimp and Grits were simply prepared low country style. Uber flavorful gravy with a perfect amount of kick and creamy grits. Very filling and satisfying. A glass of Chardonnay went perfect with this dish.   Hubby order a classic Lobster roll. Huge hunks of lobster on greens and a remoulade sauce on a lightly toasted bread was fantastic. They let the lobster just be lobster. Why mess with perfection. Rose' was his wine choice.   A perfect spot to have our last meal of 2016 . Service was friendly and professional. Never underestimate how important southern hospitality is to a restaurant experience. Sea Level NC can put anyone in their culinary happy place !",

I have had their oysters before and they are good so will be back to visit for one of my favorite things in life.  This occasion we ordered some yummy apps and beers. Had a shrimp bun, pork bun, and fried oyster taco. My favorite was the pork bun and would recommend that at around $5. I was really looking forward to the oyster taco as the fried oysters were good but some of the flavor was lost because the aioli seemed to overpower. Was way too much. Maybe just needs a little lemon instead or at least simmer down a bit on how much aioli. Food all in all is solid.  Service was fantastic and while bellying up to the bar the bartender seemed very knowledgeable about the menu. He made some great recommendations on oysters and the sandwich's. He mentioned the grouper so may come back for that one and some oysters. Usually my go to would be the lobster roll but maybe a little overpriced.",

Aside from some confusion with our table reservation, we were seated within a few minutes of the reservation at a large booth.  The menu consists of oysters and other seafood offerings.  Some of our table ordered appetizers to share and the mussels were absolutely amazing. I'm not a big fan of mussels but these were tender with a flavorful broth. The corn fritters were really good as well and I heard the oysters were a hit at our table also.  For an entree, I went with the clam chowder and lobster roll. The clam chowder was amazing. At many places you get a couple bits of clam and maybe a few potatoes, this soup was full of clams and potatoes. The lobster roll was ordered Connecticut style and did not disappoint.   What made this dinner even more memorable was our server, Crystal. She described everything beautifully and was very attentive to our table. Honestly, she could have read off a page in the Charlotte Observer and made it sound like a 4-star meal.  We definitely need to return here!",

Our waiter (neglected to remember his name) was attentive without being pushy which is how some waiters can be servicing the lunch crowd. I had the pick 2 - one small plate and one side. I opted for the fried chicken steam bun with honey bbq and slaw and the Parmesan tater tots. The steam bun was well made with just the right amount of softness without it being doughy. The chicken was fried to perfection (not dry and nice crust) which was a good balance with the bun.  The Parmesan tater tots!!! Awesome. I was expecting tots with Parmesan sprinkled on but these has a Parmesan crust!  I'd go back just for those!   Overall a nice experience - I definitely want to go back and try dinner.  Nice spot for lunch without the feeling of being rushed.  Loved it!",

That's one thing that we appreciate it deciding if we were going to come back with friends.  The elements gives off a quiet vibe. Almost as if you have to be real relaxed and quiet during your whole food experience. Which gives passage to how it is while you're fishing for food. You have to be calm, you don't want to scare the fish.  I chose to get the old fashion which came out very well. I also got the fish and grits I felt like that would be a basic meal for my very first visit. I must say I didn't enjoy the gravy that the shrimp and grits were made in. But overall my partner had the salmon salad which came out amazing. I wish I made that my first choice.",

We ordered the Clam chowder, oysters, Salmon special and Salmon Tartar. Wow! I was blown away by the flavors and the just right amount to get me full. The kids got kids meals.  The service was great. The atmosphere was almost too fancy for bringing my three little kids. They ended up behaving well.   I was raving about this place to my family the whole night. I wanna go back when we're in town. Yes to Sea Level!",

    "text": "I'm a little conflicted regarding Sea Level NC.  On one hand the food is very good but I do have a significant hang up paying $21 for a single catfish filet.  That's just not right in my book.  The Good - Nice looking restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating - Service was very good.  The wait staff really know the menu. - Decent selection of booze including local beer on tap - Nice selection of oysters on the menu from multiple locations - Everyone in my party really liked their entrees - Very nice selection of seafood on the menu - Standard menu and a rotating daily menu with fresh sea food from the Carolinas - Turf items for folks in your party that want something else (burger, steak, chicken, etc.)  The WTF - Even though it was good, $21 for a single catfish filet is just nuts - Shrimp and grits was over $20.  Good but man that is high.  Note, I don't mind dropping bucks for good food and a good experience.  I do have a hang up with traditional cheap eats being slightly elevated and sold for more than double what it should be.    All that said, I would recommend but stick with the other items on the menu.",

They also have other items besides seafood. Also try the mussels that are from Maine and are prepared in a white wine garlic butter sauces and comes with bread.

I ordered the Carolina catfish with cole slaw and fries and it was good as well, although the catfish can use a little more seasoning. The portions were pretty reasonable as well. The price was a little high but no worries there if the experience is as good as we had ever visit. We will return again!! Thanks for the great experience Sea Level restaurant.",

Absolutely my new favorite place for seafood in Charlotte, HANDS DOWN! It was my best friend's birthday dinner & they brought his dessert with a candle in it after my unconsciously mentioning it was his birthday as were sat down. We had reservations for 8:30p on a Wednesday & it was not packed at all! We were seated immediately and our drink order was taken at the same time we ordered apps. As far as appetizers go.. all I have to say is CORN FRITTERS & TEMPURA SHRIMP!! Don't cheat yourself & miss out on those two options. I got champagne with a cranberry sugar cube in it.. forget the name of it but it has \"Bubble\" in the title! I drank 5 of them so don't judge my memory! My BF had the house white wine & loved it! Everything on the menu is locally sourced as it's a farm-to-fork concept restaurant! (my favorite type) So the wine was local and amazing. I had the Catfish Ruben with hand-cut fries & a side salad: AMAZE BALLS! It was like a catfish melt on garlic bread! *kisses fingers* The fries were gone before the sandwich was! My BF had the Lobster Roll & Grits which he loved, loved, loved! Everything was so fresh!! He almost ordered it again to bring home! This place is amazing. I can't wait to go again this weekend!! :)",

Would have sat outside, but there was an obnoxiously noisy food truck serving patrons at the patio bar at Connolly's next door. We didn't have reservations so we got a small table near the front door, but it wasn't bad. Our server was friendly.  Nice wine selection.  I had the trout and a side salad. The trout was delicious. My husband had salmon and he was disappointed by the small serving. His was much smaller than my generous portion of trout. The side salad was frustrating because there were huge leaves of lettuce on a plate. The croutons and lettuce kept falling off the plate.  It's loud inside and hard to hear the server and your dinner partner.",

The tempura batter was strong, the shrimp inside was chunky and had the right texture - it was just bland as was the sauce that came with it.   This needed some salt, an acid based sauce to cut the heavy tempura batter, some seasoning something....   the shrimp and grits was spot on, definitely on point.   I had the fried oyster slider or bun which was excellent.   Of course I had to try some oysters, which is where this place shines.    These were excellent.   I also tried the shrimp cocktail and while the portion was impressive, the rest was again unremarkable.   Again, no seasoning, nothing remarkable about the cocktail sauce, needed some punch.   With the ambience, this place has potential to be an nice downtown bar - unfortunately both my vodka based cocktails were delivered tepid.   I had do some serious table side stirring and mixing to get it where it needed to be.   It's not that difficult to shake a cocktail or even invert it.   This place was also not that busy to excuse this twice made mistake.   It's got good bones, I'd definitely give it another try but some small tweaks would easily turn a 3 into a 5.",

It seems $14 cocktails are the norm these days, even if you're not in Manhattan. Had the shrimp bun and the oyster bun, both of which were outstanding.

Our poor waiter seemed completely overwhelmed. That said.. we each ordered multiple drinks, that took 20 minutes to arrive, and once they did arrive, they were wrong and had to be sent back. The waiter was apologetic.. but it put a damper on the overall experience. The corn fritter app was just okay, nothing to write home about. I will say that the shrimp and grits appetizer was excellent. The consensus from the table (food-wise) was good, but not great. Like I said, will probably give this place another shot, as I liked the decor/vibe/location.",

On my last occasion I tried the lobster roll and was greeted by a nearly perfect example of any lobster roll I've ever tried.  The bread didn't dominate the sandwich.  This is the critical element IMO.    The service was quick and extremely friendly.  The seating and dining area was clean and pleasantly cozy.  Good date spot prior to a play uptown if you have plans for that sort of thing.",

There were an average of 2-5 people working behind the bar the majority of the night but it might as well have been 0 because the service was horrendous. We were continuously ignored, left with empty drinks for 10 minute intervals and waited for the check for at least 15 minutes. If the bar had been packed I would have totally understood but there were only 6 people total (including us). The bartenders spent a lot of time talking in the corner, drinking personal beverages and showing us a spectacular view of their backs. I have worked in the service industry on numerous occasions through the years and was really surprised how bad this experience was.",

There's a lot of reviews for SL so I'm just gonna keep mine short and sweet --  1) It's kinda dark in the restaurant, so be prepared to pull out a flashlight if you can't read your menu. However, the decor is nice and the servers welcoming! They're always going to check and make sure that your night is a good night.  2) The raw oysters are definitely cheaper here than at Fin and Fino, but there's a smaller selection. I always go for the Sea Level oysters as I like mine briny and salty rather than sweet.  3) Don't hesitate to ask for suggestions. The menu seems large but there's a lot of good stuff in it -- the lobster roll is quite tasty and the fish entrees are always perfectly cooked.  4) Save room for dessert -- and definitely share them. They're large and tasty and a good way to close out the night.",

But on a recent visit during Queen's Feast Restaurant Week, I was only moderately impressed. While the corn fritters and clam chowder we ordered for our appetizers were both outstanding, the main courses that followed were somewhat underwhelming. I ordered the Catfish Cioppino, which was bland and somewhat sparse, while my wife enjoyed a tasty plate of Beef Short Ribs. We ended the meal with a delicious pair of Lemon Tarts, served on a flaky graham cracker crust.  (Full disclosure: my last dish of Cioppino was at San Francisco's Tadich Grill, so the bar was a little high.)  Sea Level has a cool and trendy interior with a great ambiance -- boisterous, but not so noisy that you can't have a conversation. The wine and cocktail list is extensive, and there's a solid selection of local and regional craft brews in bottles and on tap. Service was friendly and efficient, which is about as much as you can expect during Restaurant Week.   We'll definitely be giving Sea Level another chance to impress, but during Queen's Feast, the package was just OK.",

We immediately noticed that tons of gnats were flying around us, which definitely turned us off. We ordered some drinks and they came quickly. I had the Meow Mule, which was delicious.   My husband ordered a few Sea Level oysters since he has never had raw oysters on the half shell. He loved them! He also ordered a burger with fries and thought they were delicious. I can attest that the fries were fresh and yummy.  I ordered the shrimp and grits and was definitely disappointed. The grits were dry and tasteless. There were tons of grits, but with them being so tasteless, it needed more gravy or sauce to make it palatable. The shrimp were small and decent, but they were a tad overcooked. The sauce was tasty, but like I said, there was not enough of it. I ate the shrimp and the sauce and left half the grits.   Overall, I'd definitely like to go back and try the lobster roll, but I will not be getting the shrimp and grits again.",

Our server no his new name is Master Upseller did and over the top job. He took his time explaining everything on the menu what to try first the taste how to pair and so one. We received our 2 dozen oysters and went to town. The Sauces that came with the oysters were spot on as they were fresh with that slight seawater and sand taste. Fresh I mean pick up out the ocean an open with the sand still in your toes fresh. We enjoyed that then tried the seafood paella with the Lobster tail which he recommended.  As we started eating another sever came over and asked how we enjoyed everything told us about the sliders and ceviche. Our original server came back asking how everything was and also suggested the slides and in great detail explained each of the flavors. With that said we order the sliders. While we waited for our order the floor manager stopped by and asked how things were going we smiled and said perfect. We had the seafood and pork belle sliders that had amazing full flavor on a sticky bun wow. Needless to say the place packed but everyone was working hard making it seem in perfect order with quality, cleanliness and accuracy. Even the team shucking oysters was chatting with us and telling us about the strawberry ceviche which we are going to get next time. Words can't describe how awesome this place. We are coming back next week and for Birthday I am celebrating here.",

My waitress Ariel was incredible and helped me find an delicious dinner. Unfortunately, by no fault of hers, I had a small issue. Upon hearing, she headed back inside to get the manager.   The manager Andrew was quick to come over and more than made up for the inconvenience. The food here is incredible and the people are even better. If you're ever in the area and are looking for a fantastic seafood dinner, give this place a shot. If I'm ever back, it'll be first on my list of places to grab dinner.",

Both were tasty, but I'd note that the cheese on the Rueben was borderline a little much for me. I like cheese on everything except seafood for the most part. That said, I can get this sandwich again and definitely polish it off.  Service: super polite, super attentive and definitely knowledgeable, but a little slow due to a week day lunch rush. They were certainly apologetic so I'll let slide this time.  Atmosphere: perfect for the occasion. Biz cas work lunch. Clean, comfortable, exposed wood, not loud, not quiet.  I'd go back!",

I was not disappointed with the service, food and drinks!  I sat at the bar for a drink and bite to eat and ended up striking a conversation with the bartender who gave me some advice on exploring Charlotte. I tried the clam chowder which was delicious, it was cream based but was not heavy or too rich and was full of fresh clams! The lobster roll was recommended by the bartender and it was 4 stars, the fries were hot yummy and the lobster was fresh! I chose the Connecticut style and though I was pleased that the lobster was not doused in butter there was lacking a little bit of seasoning and flavor, maybe the Maine style would have had more flavor.   The drink was bourbon based but refreshing with ginger beer, I tried the peach bourbon cocktail.",

This place offers a great bar, outside patio and rustic-chic inside dining!  Second, if you're looking for a quiet dining experience, do not go here. It's bustling with music and at times, you'll need to speak up or lean in for your conversations! Ok with me, I got my bop on at the table!   Drinks -- they have a great selection! Classic, bartenders choice and seasonal libations, whatever suits your fancy! I wanted bourbon, so I tried my servers choice, it was great, btw. Thanks Orlando!   Food -- outside of restaurant week, if it's your first time and you're an oyster lover--start there. Get the skinny on where they source and make your selections! You'll love them and DO use their hot sauce(s).    Last night, we tried their 3-course dinner for restaurant week and everything was lovely. Ceviche - YAS. Lobster Bisque -- YUM. Shrimp & Grits - doesn't touch Charleston, but good! Salmonnnnn -- OMG, this was by far the best salmon dish I've had in a long time!   Dessert -- this was a bummer for me. If I'm going to go all out--those calories need to be worth it. They weren't. Banana pudding and ice cream cake just didn't do it -- for myself or my husbae.   Let me know if you decide to check them out!!",

I really enjoyed the oysters they were great. We ended up getting several rounds. I ended up getting the shrimp and grits which was ok. I wish it would've been a little more flavorful.

Our waiter was great and very informative considering this was our first visit. He was knowledgeable about the menu, where the seafood is sourced from, and made great recommendations.   We ordered the chargrilled oysters. They were good, I didn't read the description on the menu very carefully so the Chicago Giardiniera threw me off on the first bite. It was good, but not sure if I would order them again. My husband wasn't a fan, but hey, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, right?   My husband ordered the catfish Ruben and some of Sea Level's own oysters. He loved both, but especially liked the oysters. He said it was some of the best he's ever had.   I ordered the paella and it was huge! Not sure how one person can finish all of it! Very good and I would order that again if we came back.",

    "text": "Food 4.5 Value 4 Service 5 Decor 4.5  My friends and I spent 4 days in Charlotte and enjoyed this place so much we ate here twice-- once for dinner + lunch.   For dinner, we had a lovely server named Sam. He was training another server, Jessie at the time- both were SO attentive even though the restaurant was packed. Sam did a great job explaining their menu + recommending dishes. They have a DAILY fresh menu for oysters + raw bar options--- can't get more fresh than that! From 4-7pm, their Sea Level oysters are $1 each and there's no minimum or maximum order! Can't beat that.   For dinner, we ordered a bunch of apps + 2 entrees to share:   - 10 Sea Level Oysters-- all super fresh! The fennel vinaigrette is too die for.   - Calabash Shrimp- deep fried goodness   - Watermelon salad - this was my least favorite appetizer. The pickled watermelon rind was SO overpowering- super sour. The jalapeno honeydew was also too potent. It was a flavor blast but not in a good way. This dish was the most visually appealing by far though.   - Fish taco- I have dreams about this taco. Order it. The corn + slaw compliment the blackened catfish so well.   - Shrimp bun - I didn't try this but my friend LOVED it.   - Seafood paella- it's a modern take on a traditional paella. Had a few shrimp, mussels + fish on top. There's an option to add lobster tails which in hindsight, we should have done. The paella had great flavor.   - NC King Mackerel - this was part of their daily menu. The curried cauliflower rice is the star of this dish. The mackerel itself was cooked well but lacked flavor. Literally just needed a pinch of salt + fresh cracked pepper and it would have gone a long way.    DRINKS:  - Our favorites were the Meow Mule and G&T Seasonal. The meow mule had a classic twist and included strawberry and mint flavors-- super refreshing. The G&T seasonal had watermelon, was super complex and was so beautiful.   For lunch the following day, we ordered--   - Catfish reuben- flavors were GREAT. Slaw added a nice crunch. The bread was a little soggy because of the sauce from the slaw. My only recommendation here would be to use a thicker bread.   - Lobster roll- my friend loved it. You have the option to have the lobster tossed in butter or mayo.   - Shrimp po-boy - my friend LOVED it and said the shrimp were fried well   Come here and definitely take advantage of their $1 oyster special Mon -Fri from 4-7!  This place is great for business meals, catching up with friends, or date night!",

    "text": "One of my go to's for $1 oysters before 7 pm. They have it worked out with a farm in the Blue Point area to sell exclusively to them so they call the oysters \"Sea Level.\" They are a medium size and very mild flavor, so great for if you're just getting into oysters. I usually try to go before 7 so I can start with 6-12 and not feel too guilty.  They used to do oyster/food tastings and alcohol pairings monthly, and that was an amazing experience. Either I got removed from the list after moving away for a year, or they just stopped (hoping it's the latter). ;) They should still have local events, and I recommend them.  The food is typically tasty, as the chef tries to be inventive and does some unique flavors, which I always appreciate. I usually love the fish taco, (one time I ordered it the fish wasn't good) but I'd still recommend it.  Squid chow chow and corn fritters are pretty good.  The salads are a 4/5 - nothing crazy.  It's a pretty sea food heavy place so if people in your party aren't huge fans their options are limited, just something to note - not a bad thing.  Drinks are also good, they have some high end wines and sparklings.  Overall the staff is always terrible so do not go if you're in a hurry, they take forever. I've been outright ignored on a few occasions, but I keep coming back for HH and wine. And I just know I can't be in a hurry so it doesn't bother me as much because I already know it will be terrible so I'm not set up for failure.   Hope that helps!",

There's indoor parking and the restaurant will validate your pass so you don't have to pay. The layout of the restaurant is a little weird to me, but also is casual and has booths, so I can deal.  Chris was our server and we started off with a beer and the house punch. We ordered 10 house oysters before 7 getting the 1$ rate and we ordered a variety of the other fresh oysters:  2 night tides, 2 bush point, 3 Malpeque. The house oysters were actually the best considering the price,  size,  Freshness.   We also ordered the Salmon tartar, the Calamari, Fish tacos, Shrimp cocktail, Oysters noda and Connecticut lobster roll. We would recommend the salmon tartar,  the calamari,  and the lobster roll.  My personal fave was the lobster roll. I would have to have fresh oysters and a lobster roll if I came back.   We ended the dinner with the cast iron apple dessert with vanilla ice cream. That was pretty good.   Chris made the experience extremely pleasant.  There was no point during the meal where we didn't have what we needed or couldn't find Chris.  He was also very friendly.  Would hope to have him as our server again if we return.",

    "text": "Local folks will know that Sea Level is arguably one of the best seafood restaurants in Charlotte. Located in uptown, this restaurant is very nice for a date night or a night out with friends. Sea Level has been ranked various times as the best seafood restaurant in Charlotte.   Cool story: The delicious seafood is provided by a family of fishermen, who live in Sea Level, North Carolina. They have years of experience and are oyster experts. The restaurant is decorated with artwork and slideshows of the town of Sea Level.   Our waiter was super accommodating and gave great suggestions. We ordered a lot of things throughout the night and he was attentive.   Now let's talk FOOD. Shrimp. Oysters. Lobster. Calamari. YUM. I tried the very popular Lobster Poboy. I got very tender, buttery lobster chunks on a soft roll. Very delicious. The risotto is also VERY delicious. I also tried the Canadian oysters and my taste buds were very happy. They'll serve the oysters with cocktail sauce, two different vinegars and lemons, over ice. They have a whole selection of oysters from different regions. I felt that a good portion of their menu is Southern/Cajun inspired, like their shrimp and grits, as well as the Poboy.  I think the oil/grease was a bit too generous on the food but nothing that made it bad. For dessert we tried the apple crumble which comes with ice cream and whipped cream. A great choice for the pastry lovers.   The bartenders at Sea Level have talent in the mixology department. Grab some calamari and drinks at the bar, very, very nice option.  Also, pregnant ladies and designated drivers rejoice: they have BOMB mock tails. For those who don't know, mocktails are essentially cocktails without the alcohol. The kitten whiskers is my favorite one, tastes like a tangy Moscow Mule.   Overall, I really enjoyed date night at Sea Level & I would definitely return.",

    "text": "Clam chowder and Maine lobster roll, that's a wrap.   I was wandering the streets of Charlotte on a weeknight during a business trip, looking for a seafood dinner. I'm glad I found Sea Level.   It was fairly empty, but since I was a loner, I grabbed a spot at the bar. I'm a sucker for an old fashion and they had a smoked one on the menu, so that was a quick decision. I hated it. I'm a fan of smokey drinks, but this one was odd, skip.   Now, for the food, the clam chowder had tons of clam, it was perfectly silky, creamy, and hearty. Perfect for a chilly night.   My lobster roll was pouring over with juicy chunks of lobster. I had to contain my excitement when this thing came out, I didn't want to be that weird girl at the bar just grinning and salivating. I tried to be sneaky with my photos too, but I'm sure I was busted. Oh well. My first bite was exactly how I hoped it would be, I was overwhelmed with pleasure.  I had a great meal, service was quick and friendly. I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area again.",

I made reservations easily through the Yelp app. Upon arrival we were seated immediately and greeted by a very friendly waiter who offered us water, as well as highlighting some of their top items on the Lunch Menu.  Among our group, there were a variety of entrees ordered, but the top two were the Shrimp Po Boy and the Clam Chowder. The Clam Chowder was not too creamy, not too watery, just right, with an enormous amount of some of the freshest clams I've ever had. As for the Po Boy, it was packed with fresh, lightly fried shrimp. The restaurant is inviting and the service was on point. I am looking forward to returning for some oysters, seafood tower and definitely some more Clam Chowder.",

I think she was new and a little nervous. We had the salmon, bass, catfish and mussels appetizer. Everything was delicious. My only complaints are 1) the tables are way too close together.  I felt like the guy next to me was sitting on my jacket and like we were dining with them.  It was a long booth with tables and chairs on the other side. And 2) the hostess didn't point out the coat check when we came in.  It's not in a visible spot and I didn't notice it until we were walking out.  It was very awkward with how close the tables were to have my coat next to me and then to try to put it back on at my table. I felt like i was totally in everyone's way.  And the job of a hostess is to offer the coat check if there is one.  So a few kinks to work out but overall very nice dining experience.",

I wouldn't order that again.  Looks good but let's your mouth down. I'd go to Redeye Diner (who would've thought a diner would have great shrimp and grits) or Peculiar Rabbit for that. But let me get to the main reason for my review...their oysters!  BEST IVE EVER HAD!  ALWAYS fresh and a great selection that changes so you'll be able to keep going back and trying different ones. They always have the sea level oysters and those are pretty decent. If you're looking for raw oysters, this is the place. They are not cheap ($3-$4 each) but you are paying for quality and it's worth it.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch yesterday and had really high hopes.  I work in the Heart Tower so was excited to finally try it.  I ordered the fried oyster taco and a salad with shrimp on it.  The highlight was definitely the taco, which was crispy and fresh and very good.  Next time I'll probably just order two tacos.  The salad was nothing to write home about except for the croutons (they almost tasted like cornbread) and the apple cider vinaigrette.  Otherwise, paying like $7 for a salad and then an additional $6 to add about 4 smaller-sized shrimp did not seem worth it to me.  Would potentially try this for dinner, but probably only if I'm craving oysters.  I'm hoping at some point soon they'll just have fresh fish on their menu that you can order for a healthy lunchtime meal (it's so hard to find a good warm lean protein/veggies meal uptown when you're sick of salads all the time).  So, bottom line: order two fried oyster tacos for a real lunchtime treat.",

My husband ordered the grouper and they brought mahi mahi and said they were out of grouper so they substituted.  I was floored that they didn't tel us or ask him to make another selection.  Everyone else had something marginal in the plate. The gazpacho on my fish was just a tomato paste. The greens on my other son's plate were too sweet to eat. Although we were there two hours, the service was so poor and slow that we didn't have time for coffee or dessert. The sound level was so loud that conversation was difficult.",

I've also been a server for over a decade and the service was immaculate-Christopher was his name. Definitely recommend him-and go with what he suggests! He really knows his stuff. The oysters were on special til 7 (which was when our reservation was) but he gave us the special anyway! Also in lieu of dessert I wanted a martini and the bartender even came to the table to make sure I got what I wanted. I'm super impressed and will definitely be back. Best birthday dinner I've had in years. Thank you!!",

They're always fresh and shucked perfectly. We probably come here at least once a week and just make an amazing meal out of some oysters, a bottle of muscadet, and some grilled bread. I can't speak too much about the other food except the salmon Caesar which was very good, and the hushpuppies which were a little too sweet for my taste. The service is always great, and we've never really had a bad experience here at all.",

The True stand out for me was the bar. Cocktails were incredibly creative and executed very well. Kudos to the mixologist and team.  The most important thing about this place is the hole it fills in uptown. Apart from a chain and sushi places theres no real seafood place in uptown. This brings new energy and life to 5th street.",

Our mussel dish was also excellent but the surprise highlight of the meal was the short ribs.   One of the tastiest and most tender pieces of meat I have ever had!  As an added kicker, we had several unique and tasty cocktails.  The only thing that prevents me giving the 5th star was the decor and seating.  The seating is a bit cramped, except to hear the conversation next to you and the decor was rather non descript.",

    "text": "OK let me start by saying i always try and stay away from seafood restaurants in cities that are not near the coast. I lived at the beach for years so my expectations of fresh good seafood is very high but we went with another couple and those chose the restaurant so i didnt have a choice.  We started off with a few apps, 2 orders of Oysters Noda, 2 orders of Duck Taco's and the 2 orders of the pork belly. The Oysters Noda came out and the toppings on the oysters were cooked but the oyster was almost raw. This app is a play off of Oysters Rockefeller which i love, we asked the waitress the oysters aren't cooked but the toppings are  and her response is thats they way we do it and my response was no its not cause the table next to us had the same exact app and i asked them if it was cooked all the way and they said yes so she took them back.  So when they brought them back they did not make new ones they just popped the ones we were given into the oven which over cooked all the toppings and was just not good at all.  I read the reviews on the duck tacos being salty and yesssss they are so you better like salt. The pork belly was awesome very good. The corn-fritters are amazinggggggg.  My wife got the smoked salmon risotto and the salmon was all mixed in not a whole piece and it was sooo smoky she could not finish it. I had the lobster roll and it was average at best. The shrimp po-boy was very good according to the guys i was with. The kicker was at the end were i ordered a specialty cocktail from their menu. This one cocktail i was looking at had laphroaig in the recipe and me being a scotch lover asked the waitress just to make sure thats what it was and she told me no its not scotch its their version of a soda water that has a effervescent taste to it.  I asked are you sure i have never heard of that and she said absolutely, well i ordered the drink and it was scotch.  Our waitress was not familiar with the menu and the items on the food and drink menu's and the service was very very slow and they were not busy at all.  I can not recommend this place on the items we had their other menu items might be more appetizing but the ones mentioned in my review i would not order.",

Our wonderful server, Stephanie, offered margaritas & suggested the corn fritters for an appetizer- they taste like fluffy clouds of yum with a nice crunch. My mom went with the po boy sandwich and I went with the catfish Reuben, you read right, REUBEN. It was delicious, it's probably going to my favorite. Since I had mentioned to Stephanie it was my mom's birthday, she brought her a complimentary dessert shooter; flavors included pineapple upside-down cake, black cherry forest chocolate( or something like that lol) & the one my mom chose, carrot cake it was yummy too. Overall Sea Level is a great new addition to Uptown Charlotte's restaurants but it offers more than just great seafood dishes  & customer service but a wonderful event space too; I can definitely see birthday parties, networking receptions and wedding dinners happening here. Go visit & tell Stephanie 'hello' She is awesome!",

There was Salmon (get that anywhere), Porgy with skin on, Trigger fish Cioppino (a fish and shellfish stew), Catfish and that was about it. And those dishes were $25 - $30 each. Not what I expected and especially for that price. I thought there would be Grouper, Redfish, Sea Trout, Tuna, Wahoo or more. I know those are seasonal fishes and they may not be available in NC at this moment. But I don't think Trigger fish Stew, Catfish and Porgy are going to keep this place in business at these prices. If I were to go again I would call ahead and see what's on the menu before I ventured their way.",

My first visit, the service was horrible and slow, with a server who acted as if it was a chore to refill drinks.  The restaurant was not busy, so it's hard to understand why this person was so unpleasant.  My second visit, which was yesterday, the service was outstanding, quick without rushing us and very pleasant.    Unfortunately the food experience has varied as well:  Catfish Rueben:  Very Good \"Natural Cola\": Not Good Corn Fritters:  Excellent Duck Taco:  Very Bad, so salty I couldn't eat it Shrimp Steam Bun:  Not Good, shrimp has an odd flavor and the dough-to-shrimp ration is off, meaning you get mainly steamed dough.  I also could not finish it due to the odd taste.  I am an adventurous eater with eclectic tastes, but the menu at this restaurant needs tweaking and the kitchen and waitstaff need consistent instruction.  Based on being served two items I found inedible, I can only give two stars.",

Everyone liked their food, everyone ordered from the sandwich menu.  I had the blackened catfish reuben that was good.  My son had a local brewed IPA which was very good.

The server we had was hot and cold with us... he snapped at me when I questioned the types of oysters since we're not familiar with oysters or the area, he didn't seem very friendly but was super nice when the check came.. of course. One of the guys that was shucking was kind enough to explain some of it to us which we appreciated. They're machines, I tell ya! and I like the different vinegars they have in the small bottles.

This would be great both for a happy hour and a romantic dinner.   Everything I ordered was so delicious! First, I got the corn fritters, which were like hushpuppies with corn inside. I liked them because they weren't too sweet. My order came with about 10, which was plenty. I took some home and they reheated nicely. I had the short rib as my main dish, and it was so good. It was very tender and had great flavor. For dessert, I had the Bourbon-Chocolate Chip Pound Cake and it was heavenly. It was soft and chocolatey and had a great bourbon flavor that wasn't overwhelming.",

I ordered an Old Fashioned and was very pleasantly surprised. When we were seated we were greeted by our server. She was very nice and friendly.   Now, you're probably asking who I gave 3 stars,so here goes. The food was average, service was slow and the menu for Restaurant Week was lacking. I'd been interested in trying this place after hearing about it but I could've waited for another time. I will say I was impressed by the dining managers attentiveness to our needs and the manner in which she resolved any issues.",

Bianca was a pleasure to work w/& made it incredibly easy.  The group as a whole enjoyed their 3 course meal.  One indicating it was the best clam chowder she'd ever had.   My corn fritters aka gourmet hush puppies were tasty.  They are served w/a citrusy spicy sauce. It may not seem like it packs a punch wait for the after burn.  Shrimp & grits was fabulous!  2 in the party had never had shrimp & grits before & were convinced to try it because the kitchen was accommodating & provided a sample before our order was placed.  My only suggestion would be to be a little less heavy handed w/the gravy.  It subdued the taste of the grits & was like overdressing a salad.  Luckily, it's quite scrumptious.  Lastly, for dessert, 2 people ordered the cake which was quite decadent & the rest of us ordered the Key Lime Ice Cream Sandwich which was a delightful burst of citrus to finish a truly delightful meal.  The service was superb.  They never made us feel as if we were an inconvenience like some do when it is part of a party esp 1 of all females.   I would recommend Sea Level for a small group of 12 or just a wonderful meal between friends.  I look forward to my next experience at Sea Level :)",

I love to come here after Hornets games for oysters and rose. I make sporting events classy, y'all.   I primarily come here for oysters, but if I'm looking for more I usually get the corn fritters or the lobster roll. I'm a sucker for lobster rolls and this one is fresh and delicious. Again, shout out to Kseniya M for the corn fritters rec. I would've never thought to order those here and they are so good. The catfish reuben is pretty unique and tasty. You can also place orders online to pick up.   The patio is a nice spot to people watch. I personally enjoy sitting in front of the raw bar so I can watch them prep the oysters. I find it fascinating. How on earth are they able to crank through so many and not cut themselves?!

Something that doesn't make me feel like I need to hit the gym to burn it all off?  Thank you, Sea Level NC for answering my wishes!  My coworker and I snagged a table on Monday night, finding the place with plenty of seating left, but the room still abuzz with people who just got off from work and want to enjoy a cocktail after a long day. The menu is simplistic, but offers a variety of seafood dishes, both small and large. In dire need of something besides meat, we got the Maine mussels in whine garlic sauce as an appetizer to share, and then for an entree I chose the tile fish filet with an assortment of vegetables and sriracha aioli.   Our waiter for the night was Andrew who was wonderfully charismatic and made us feel comfortable with ease. His consistent check-ups on us throughout the night as well as useful recommendations made for a lovely dinner. His service was phenomenal!  When the mussels hit our table, I could already smell the garlic butter sauce, making my mouth water instantly. The portion was GIGANTIC which meant my coworker and I weren't going to have to fight for any mussels because my goodness, were they good! Each mussel shell had plenty of meat inside that was tender and buttery. The sauce was delectable, especially when paired with the toasted bread. Great start!  Not too soon after, my entree of the tile fish arrived and was beautifully presented on a bed of crispy kale with bright, cubed pieces of sweet potatoes strewn throughout. The aioli sauce added a nice kick of heat while the fish was flaky. The exterior was a tad bit saltier than I would have liked and there were some pieces of the fish that were hard. At one point, I thought I had eaten a bone, but it was actually just a tiny sliver of skin that was over fried. The kale retained its crunchy bite and the sweet potatoes were soft. It was a deliciously light entree that left me feeling full without all the guilt.  In fact, I ended up ordering a shot of dessert which contained layers of marshmallow, graham crackers, and chocolate, very similar to a deconstructed s'more. The marshmallow was a bit too sweet and stuck to my teeth, but the dark chocolate underneath would have appeased any chocolate lover. It was creamy, it was rich, and it was the perfect way to end the night.   Sea Level NC embodies both a classy atmosphere and delectable food. There were so many dishes I wanted to try and if given the chance, I would come back in a heartbeat. Sea Level NC was amazing!",

We have tried many things: oysters raw, fried shrimp, lobster soup, mashed potato tater tots, salad, etc.  Calamari app and shrimp tempura app are good.  One of them has a very good sweet/sour pepper sauce that was special.  Nothing amazing about it. Acoustics are terrible.  It's very loud and hard to have a conversation with another couple at a table.  It's ok if you're sitting at the bar for an app and drink.  We won't be heading to Uptown just to eat here, that's for sure.",

Our favorite was the raw oysters.  They were the best in town.  We also had oyster shooters and they was yummy as well.  The lobster sandwich was another favorite. The Shrimp cocktail and corn fritters were big hits.  A small fight broke out at our table over the last corn fritter, problem solved..we just ordered more!  You can't go wrong at this restaurant if you love fresh seafood!",

When I tell you that Sea Level being located close to me in Charlotte is the best thing that happened in the south since the abolition of slavery, know that I would sacrifice my first born for their oysters. Ballin on a budget? Don't fret bring those tight cheeks in Sea Level on a Thursday from 4-7 and inhale their 1$ oysters with a side of their house made vinaigrette that I swear is a chemical miracle made with unicorn tears and Gary Busey's laugh.  If you aren't feelings the oysters, I sometimes go to Sea Level just to talk to the staff. Weird? Maybe, but would the staff call me weird? NAY!!!! You could punch each of them in the face and they would say \"I hope you have a great day, here's 100 dollars and my phone number, please call me anytime I will be your spiritual guide throughout this crazy journey through middle earth\". I don't think it's possible for my cronies, aka the workers which they are known by onlookers and paparazzi, to wish ill will on anyone, including ISIS.

When talking to them about something I might like, they helped me decide and try something new. My girlfriend and I ordered the :shrimp tempura which was amazing, very lightly breaded and fried with an amazing spicy aioli; the fried oysters, having neither of us tried oysters before and not wanting to try the raw half shells quite yet, we settled in these, they were more heavily fried, my girlfriend and I both agreed that the texture was different and there was not much flavor to them, but not bad nonetheless; shrimp cocktail, very simply, the shrimp were peeled and deveined which was very nice and the cocktail sauce they were served with was spectacular! they were very chilled and very good; fish taco,  it was smaller than I expected but it was still adequately filling, the fish and ingredients all tasted fresh and had a great taste, it was appropriately filled, none falling out but still feeling very stuffed for the size of the grilled flour shell; the shrimp steamed bun was very flavorful and good as well, the steamed bun melted in your mouth as you bit into it, the shrimp was more of a shrimp mash which was still tasty and had a black bean burger texture, overall the other toppings balanced it out and it has a very well rounded taste. Sea Level is great for a night out and if you enjoy oysters I recommend here even more so in the hours M-F 4-7, 10-12 because they have half shells for $1 each.",

They were the Sea Level house oysters but I noticed they had lots of different types from various places. They came out on the half shell on ice with sauces. Delicious. Well sized. Exactly what oysters should be. Since my hubby doesn't eat oysters, I convinced him to order the clam chowder. Really I just wanted to try the clam chowder. Now, as a chowda afficionado, this chowder was delish! Would absolutely order this again. I also tried some of the corn fritters. Super tasty.

    "text": "Anyone for seafood?  YES!!!  How about seafood at Sea Level?   NOOooOO!!  Why not?   Because: (1) oysters are just OK; (2) super greasy, bland food; (3) less than stellar service (we got charged for another table's more expensive meal); overall, we should have spent our $65 before tip for 2 elsewhere.   I was super excited to learn that there is a seafood / oyster house down the street from where we live because I LOVE SEAFOOD, especially fresh raw oysters.  If they have them, I'm ordering them!  I've been to Sea Level a few times and my advice would be to just stick with the $1 oyster happy hour and pass on everything else.    Good ambience.  I can't speak much for the indoor dining because I prefer outdoor patio dining if it's available.  I will say that for this being a newer restaurant, each of the patio tables I've sat at were wobbly, which would be a vestige of an older establishment so it's a little bewildering.  Otherwise, the patio is tucked back from the street and if you go after rush hour on a weekday, it serves as a calm escape from the bustle of Uptown.  Not good service.  Our server got my order wrong, she served us duck tacos instead of a duck salad.  They were quick to serve the salad and offered the tacos complimentarily, which was nice of them.  Our server only came back sporadically to check up on us, which is tolerable except when we asked for a sauce for our bland crispy shrimp, they never brought it.    Finally, we typically don't review of check before signing except to calculate the tip. I wondered why our meal could be $90 for 4 oysters, 2 salads and a crispy rock shrimp order...   When I looked at the ticket, I noticed that we were charged for someone else's meal.  We had to find our absent-minded waitress to correct it and even after that, she didn't seem very apologetic for actually overcharging our credit card for the wrong meal.  If I hadn't checked, it would never have been corrected!    Greasy, bland food.  We wanted seafood because we were looking for something on the lighter side but boy were we wrong!  We had:  ++  oysters.  We ordered the Sea Level cheap ones ($1.75/oyster) and the Delaware most expensive ones ($3.75/oyster) to do a comparison.  Although the Delaware ones were a little less briny, they weren't much different in taste.    OYSTER TIP:  You can get: AYCE equal quality oysters at Georges Brasserie during their Sunday brunch; equal quality for cheaper at Pearlz Oyster Bar with better service and better food; AMAZING oysters at Baku; better quality at Capital Grille or BLT Steakhouse.    ++  crispy shrimp. The sauce was really bland and the shrimps were heavily breaded and soggy.  You can get better at Baku, Fahrenheit, Cowfish, or Mr. Tokyo Sushi.  ++  Caesar salad.  It was a huge portion but the dressing was about the same quality as grocery-store Ranch dressing;  not even Newman's brand.  It was very bland and mostly mayonnaise without the extra flavor.  All steakhouses do Caesar better as does Pearlz Oyster Bar.    ++  duck salad.  The salad is a huge portion and the dressing is a sweet cranberry-based dressing with candied pecans but the duck is very, very greasy and bland.  The heaviness of the duck really defeated the purpose of the salad altogether.    ++  duck taco.  I can't really hold this against them because it was complimentary, after all but the steamed bun was very soggy and the grease that came off the taco from the duck made my stomach churn.  I don't mind grease,  I love bacon and pork belly done right but I've never typically found duck to be so greasy ever.  The flavor of the plum sauce is sweet and goes well with the duck but seriously, it was drowned out by the greasiness.   We walked away regretting the meal and thinking that we could have been more satisfied eating at a drive-thru chain for $15 or worse, heating up a frozen pizza for $9.  I don't mind paying $$ for a delicious meal but when the food is bad topped off with bad service, it makes me feel ripped off, which is exactly how we felt after our latest meal at Sea Level.  I won't be back but I do recommend just sticking to the $1 oysters at happy hour if you want your dining experience to be commensurate to the cost of your meal.    UPDATE:  increase from 2.5 stars to 3 stars.  Immediately after I posted my review, the owner reached out to me to offer his apologies and asked us to return.  Any owner who personally seeks out to ensure that a customer experience is positive definitely deserves kudos for seeking to advocate good customer service.  At the end of the day, all we really want is to ensure that we get what we bargained for.  An owner who assumes accountability means boosted consumer confidence in an establishment.  We will return and update the review accordingly when our schedules permit.",

The restaurant is beautiful and the service is immaculate, you will hardly have to wait for anything.  The cocktails are lovely here as well, they really know how to make a great drink; I had the blackberry hibiscus spritz and the smoked old fashion.  I had the North Carolina snapper for dinner which was incredible and the flourless chocolate brownie for dessert. Overall, if you want to dine somewhere with a fantastic ambience, great service and wonderful food this is the place to go. I really enjoyed dining here and I can't wait to be back",

They had to go clean the table off, but that was no big deal. My friend ordered shrimp and grits and the shrimp almost looked raw. I ordered the fish special and it was dry. Underneath the fish and small amount of vegetables were green crumbs that I was told were bread crumbs and tarragon. It did not add to the dinner. The steamed tomatoes still had the skins on them and were tough. My husband had a bowl of clam chowder and he thought it was good, but not extremely good. It was expensive and definitely not worth going. The only thing that made me smile was the young man who cleaned our plates. He seemed to pay more attention to us than our waitress.",

Bianca was especially helpful and told us all about oysters (which they had a wide selection) and showed us a unique apple topping. Had almost all of the beers on tap and they were incredible. I recommend getting the flying dog oyster stout nitro and suckin down oysters during happy hour. I sat at the oyster shucking part of the bar which was a great white marble and cool to see. I also had the clam chowder which was incredible and my girl had a Bloody Mary, that came fully loaded that she enjoyed. Very low key and good vibes with chill music. Fantastic place would recommend to anyone. Very fair prices also.   Dress: I wore a casual grey chino with a flannel and felt very confident in that. It's an upscale place but you can get away with a flannel in there.",

I called ahead of time to ask a question regarding weekend oyster specials & was never told a reservation is required. I am a regular customer and live in the neighborhood and never have had to have a reservation. We walked in at 6:45 pm to a half empty restaurant and the hostess immediately asked if we had a reservation. We said no. She said the only seating available is at the bar or oyster bar. My friend explained she just had knee surgery and needs a lower table and I also stated I have a severe ankle injury and prefer a lower table. There were over 20 empty tables as I looked around and the hostess made a few snarky, derogatory, and immature comments towards us, declining any form of an accommodation. I was appalled at this negative experience and let her know I'll never spend another dollar at this neighborhood restaurant and will take this opportunity to check out Fin & Fino. She laughed at us as we walked out. Just want to take this opportunity to thank Sea Level for turning us away because we had an opportunity to try Fin & Fino for the first time and absolutely loved everything about this new seafood gem. Service and food were phenomenal and it made me realize how subpar and overpriced Sea Level really is. I tried calling management to provide this feedback, however, was put on hold for 8 minutes and finally hung up. The hostess had long blondish-brown hair and has a nasty attitude. It shouldn't be hard to identify her and let her know that she successfully reverted me to our new favorite restaurant in uptown!",

The dessert was good, but a $3 adder for a third scope of ice cream was a tad excessive. The atmosphere is good, as you'd expect from uptown, but they need to focus more on the plates. 3-1/2 stars.

Also had the Sea Level salad which was fresh and crispy and topped with just enough horseradish vinegar dressing and six perfectly fried oysters.   We will be back and bring friends!",

The staff was really friendly and enthusiastic about serving our group of 8. I was being really indecisive and decided to sample a few items. I got the white wine mussels, a side of corn fritters and one oyster taco. Everything was delicious. The aioli sauce on the taco really brought together the flavors. I literally had enough mussels to share with the table. The wine sauce had a light but tasty flavor. The corn fritters weren't what I was expecting because they were more like hush puppies but they were delicious, nonetheless. I will definitely return. Others in my party ordered drinks and seemed to really enjoy them so I will try them next time.",

The first time I tried raw oysters was two years ago at the The Olde Bar, in Philadelphia. Few weeks ago, I had my first oyster in Charlotte here at the Sea Level NC. I got 2 oysters from Sea Level, NC ($1each.) For the second time, I was very intimidated, I tried to copycat people seated around me, and I did good. I also had the Corn Fritters, I think I'm hooked.  What you need to know about Sea Level NC: - Happy hour #1 Monday - Saturday 4pm-7pm $1 oysters (from Sea Level, NC.) - Happy hour #2 Monday - Saturday 10pm to midnight $1 oysters (from Sea Level, NC.) - Daily fresh catch. - Saturday AND Sunday Brunch 11am-4pm. - FREE parking (2hr validation at lunchtime and 3hr at dinnertime.) - Accept reservations, walk-in and carry outs.

Phillip, the young man behind the oyster bar was so awesome. He absolutely loved his job and was so knowledgeable about oysters  from different coasts.  His personality and stories were amazing.

Ordered the Porgy fish entree with spiralized zucchini and butternut squash. The dish was a Mediterranean inspired one. Unfortunately, there was very little meat on the fish and it was attached to the skin. I tried flaking the meat away from the skin and the skin just pulled off with it. Also, the sauce in the dish was a punch in the mouth of vinegar. My tastebuds did not care for the combo in the dish at all. Sent it back. The server and Manager couldn't have been more accommodating.They were very attentive and apologetic to the fact that I was not happy with my dish. They exchanged it out with something else I ordered from the menu, which was a bit better. The Manager comped a dessert for the table for the trouble, which was nice. Will definitely give this restaurant another shot!",

It felt like the just out mayo on it and called it a day. The breading of the shrimp didn't have flavor to it either. It wasn't a bad Po boy but I don't think it was amazing. I also don't think it was worth what I st. I do like the drink I got! I can't remember the name but it was very good. The service was great however. I only tried one item so they might have better menu options but I wouldn't recommend getting the shrimp Po boy.",

    "text": "Sea Level was an all around great experience. It's not somewhere I would go if I were trying to save money. To be in the middle of all the excitement on a Saturday night in downtown Charlotte, it fulfills the expectations for a night on the town.  I will get the \"dislikes\" out of the way right off the bat. If you want a somewhat filling meal, you'll walk away spending at least $25 at the minimum (without the tip). If you do choose to sit on the patio be aware that it is very loud. There are noisy motorcycles passing by. There is also a place that plays very loud music, it is directly next door.  The food: I was very impressed at the selection of fresh oysters. They range in price from $1.75 each, all the way up to $4.00 a piece. With the exception of Happy Hour. The most expensive one's are from Seattle. I am from Oregon, so I would definitely say that you shouldn't get the most expensive Oysters just because you think they will be the best. They more than anything cost the most just because of how far they have to travel. I chose to get the NC oysters and they were very fresh, moist, and just fantastic.  I also got the Lobster Roll and I just could not pass this up. I was not displeased with it in any way at all, just that I kept wanting more! The fries that come with it helped fulfill my appetite perfectly and were awesome.  Our waitress was informative, kind, and generous. She misunderstood that we wanted two orders of Oysters instead of just one, so she ended up giving us the happy hour price for those. $1 each! That was a plus.  If I lived in NC I could totally see myself coming back, taking a date to this location.  One thing I wish I had been able to try is the \"Catfish Reuben\". What a neat idea and it's only $14. So if anyone tries that, please let me know how it is!",

Calamari had good flavor but were also tiny and sparse.  Overall, the quality did not match the price... Not a good value.

It's great for a date night or occasion dinner. Everyone was super sweet and accommodating when we asked for a booth rather than a table.   Being that it was our 1st time at the establishment, our server/bartender asked what type of drink characteristics we like and then suggested their take on a whisky sour. I kid you not, the drink was SLAMMIIIIIING! It was perfectly sour with a huge cube of frozen wine. which was the \"ice,\" in the middle. Yes please, every time.  We gorged on oysters and ordered the shrimp steam bun, duck tacos and fish tacos. All delicious. DO NOT skip the shrimp steam bun burger situation. You will thank me later .  Oh and my love set up a surprise bday party/proposal dinner for me, at this same location, a few weeks later. Holy WINNING!! The Sea Level staff was great that night as well.

Sea Level certainly did not disappoint!  Supposedly they have the best sea foodin town. While we didn't have the much acclaimed sushi, we instead settled for special oysters (from the Oyster Board) as an appetizer followed by Atlantic fresh salmon or sea bass. Amazing. Definitely some of the best sea food we have experienced here!  Food was outstanding. Period.   Service was prompt and professional. Our only issue was that I wanted a house red wine, and when I received it, it was chilled. I was told by our server that the house wines are all on tap. I've never heard of that. I tried the wine but couldn't stand it cold. Red wine is ALWAYS served at room temperature (exception, rose wine).Our server took no offense to this and brought me back a red wine at the proper temperature.  Wine aside, the experience was top notch. We will definitely repeat, probably for dinner next time!",

I was in town on business this week and came here with two colleagues.   As a \"cat enthusiast\" (aka Crazy Cat Lady), the \"Kitten Whiskers\" cocktail caught my eye and I had to try it. It did not disappoint. It consisted of chamomile, lemon juice, ginger beer and strawberry. Sooo goooood!  With regard to food, we started off with the corn fritters which were reminiscent of hush puppies- little fried balls of corn & cornbread. They were served with a spicy-ish aioli dip that was delish.  For my entree, I had the grilled salmon. It came with roasted potatoes and braised collard greens. Talk about a food multiple orgasm! OMG. The salmon was a fresh, thick, juicy center cut and melted in my mouth. The roasted potatoes? Moist and buttery tasting! Not dry like a lot of the roasted potatoes many restaurants serve. And the braised greens? TO DIE FOR! I could not believe how perfectly cooked, seasoned & flavorful they were.  This was such a superb meal!  I know Charlotte has some great culinary finds but any future business trip I make here will NOT be complete without a trip to Sea Level!",

Our server, Nate, was very nice and gave great suggestions as far as recommending what oysters we should try, being that we're oyster novices. He recommended that I try the Oysters NoDa (sooooo good). I also tried the Braised Short Rib. Typically it comes with a kale mix I believe, but I'm not into superfoods honestly, so he was able to sub out the kale bed for collard greens. The collard greens aren't typically southern greens cooked in fatty meat, they're just REALLY vinegary. Aside from that, the rib was great. My friends ordered the paella and the swordfish. The portions were relatively large. I wasn't hungry when I left. Nate also offered a free birthday dessert, I got to choose between an ice cream sundae and the blood orange cheesecake. I chose to skip out this time tho. They do offer an oyster happy hour on weekdays from 4-7 I believe(?) and they validate parking at Hearst tower!!!!",

    "text": "Sea Level makes sure that you have a positive experience, from the easy validated parking in Hearst Tower to the attentive service while dining. Even during the hustle and bustle of Queens Feast Restaurant Week we enjoyed a relaxing meal and interesting drinks.  Raw oysters for an appetizer was a great way to start before traditional shrimp and grits, but it was the chocolate pecan bread pudding that stole the show. A rectangular slice that was equally sweet and gooey, I definitely wanted a nap afterwards. My dining companion ordered the lemon tart for dessert and when the crust was too hard to even be cut through with a knife the server kindly brought us another order of the bread pudding, which had a bit of a different texture, as it was sliced from a new part of the pan, so the variety in experience was a welcome surprise!  Left Hand's milk stout on nitro pour is always a welcome option on a tap list and a good substitute for the Flying Dog oyster stout that was on the menu. Fun cocktails and True-to-Uptown experience. Nicely done. While it isn't the same kind of experience one might have at an on-the-water seafood place, Sea Level is a great option in Charlotte.",

We did not get seated at our table until 8pm. It was very annoying and I just don't get the point of reservations if they don't seat you. The staff was very apologetic and gave us two free appetizers, which was nice of them!  The apps we had were corn fritters, oysters, calamari and ceviche. The corn fritters were fantastic and they had a taste of something I couldn't quite put my finger on but it was good. Loved the oysters just fantastic. Super fresh. I'm not normally a fan of ceviche but this was light and tangy and I really liked it. The calamari was good. The briney stuff it was in made for an interesting taste.  For the main we had Shrimp and Grits, Catfish and Short Ribs. All were delicious. The grits were perfection. I tried my friend's catfish and I expected it to be super fishy but it wasn't at all. The ribs were melt in your mouth! So good.  Even though the service was super slow the staff did right by it. I will definitely go back here again.",

    "text": "Really a 3.5 Star review but yelp doesn't allow this.   The wife and I like all things from the sea, so we needed to check out this new place. Let's see how we get to 3.5 stars. It wasn't  really busy when we got there around 6pm on a week night, but it was pretty hopping by the time that we left. We wanted to see the shucking action up front and opted to sit at the oyster bar area. Our server explained the menu and the concept for us and we ordered drinks, the wife ordered a basil cucumber drink and I got their seasonal birdsong beer which was supposedly honey pie double IPA. I say supposedly it was honey pie because it definitely tasted of jalepeno but was not a pale ale. Maybe some tap line issues, I don't know. Either way the beer was fine, but it seems that their claim to fame is their cocktail list. The wife's drink was her jam and she loved it. Next time I will likely skip the beer and get a mix drink. Overall 3.5 stars for drinks  For food, we started off with a dozen oysters, which come priced per unit with varying prices based on fanciness of the oyster. Their house oyster is $1.75 and the priciest one was $4 with most being in the $2.5-$3 range. I am not sure if they have any happy hour specials but none were mentioned or on the menu. The  10 oyster varieties were definitely a plus and they were shucked expertly. It was also nice that we could experience different flavors since the oysters were from a variety of states, MA, MD and VA, if I remember correctly. The mignonette could use a little spoon for better application, but overall oysters rate a solid 4 stars.   We decided to order 2 mains and share. We opted for the tilefish and the smoked trout risotto. The food came out promptly after our oyster and we dug in. The tilefish was cooked very well with a crispy skin, but the food was mostly downhill from there. The flavor of the risotto was good and we both enjoyed the smoked trout. The risotto itself was watery for lack of better term. Now, I'm no expert in risotto, but it was probably overcooked as well based on the rice consistency. The bok choy with the tilefish was alright, and it was only after the plates were taken away that we both noticed that the turnip puree was absent from the tilefish plate. So overall, for the mains, I would say the mains were 3 stars at best. I will say that the menu had plenty of other things that I would return to try. They just opened, so maybe they just need to get some kinks out.  The cinnamon custard was shared for dessert and the wife loved it, me I'm not really a dessert guy. I should have ordered a trio of oysters for my dessert. I will say that the service was good and attentive, and they seem to be well staffed. The restaurant is also well laid out and has a good vibe to it. So there you have it, a 3.5 star experience that I must downgrade to a 3 star rating due to yelp restrictions. We shall return, even if only for drinks and oysters.",

Shockingly the restaurant was not super crowded at all, but after the meal I think I kinda know why?  The ambiance is very cool with their \"outdoor patio\" being industrial with a good vibe!  My husband had oysters of course and said that they were pretty delicious for a Charlotte restaurant!  I had two crab claws, both of which had crumbled shells so I ended up picking shells out of each bite of my crab meat!  Additionally, they weren't as large as I am used to, but perhaps that is because I typically have them in Charleston SC.  I ordered a salad for dinner which was delicious but still just a salad.  I would have to say that although the martini list was almost non existant, that the French pear was really good!!  All in all, we ended up spending $150 after tip for three cocktails, three beers, a salad and oysters...   OH YEAH, the 12 oysters were $40.00... seems steep to me, but maybe I just don't know the market!",

Forgot to mention their version of calamari...( squid chow chow) that we had for a starter. We all agreed it was the best we had ever eaten.....the sauce was sweet and spicy and perfect! We didn't really have room for dessert...but thankfully that didn't stop us.... flourless brownie and apple cobbler...outstanding!!  Oh....and you should know that the briny oysters from Sea Level (the place, not the restaurant) are the BEST. Pretty cool that this restaurant is named for and serves them!",

Around 7 or so the place got slammed and I mean SLAMMED. So plan accordingly.   The space is really nice inside, they did a great job converting it from what was once City Tavern and then LaVecchia's (hard to believe it's the same space!). There's also a patio for those nice weather days. I loved the vibe when we first arrived, but like I said it got crazy in there. The bartenders were friendly and quick to take our order.   We decided to do a couple rounds of appetizers - including the pork belly steamed bun and shrimp steamed bun, shrimp & grits, and the apple endive salad. Everything we tried was tasty - the only complaint is nothing came out hot. Luke warm at best. They need to add some food runners! We could see the kitchen window and food was piling up.   Considering they've been open just a month, I think they'll work out the kinks. I will happily visit again to try some of their entrees and hopefully the giant brownie I spied at another table!",

And - it's the little things that matter - service of cocktail and mignonette was very nice.  The hubs got a local brew, and I enjoyed a perfectly made slightly dirty vodka martini (followed by another later...couldn't help myself!).  Our first time at this cool place was all about sampling, so we went for small plates and decided on duck tacos, steamed shrimp bun and mussels in garlic wine sauce.  Everything was excellent.  Complex recipes, just the right amount of spice, and a smokey fish saucey mussel broth that coaxed the deep flavors out of each mussel (intense!).  Next time, I will try something completely new from the excellent menu - but I will definitely make it a point to arrive between 4 and 7 to enjoy $1 oysters (which were smallish, but decent).  The couple next to us ordered the $125 tower, which was gorgeous!  A gigantic impressive 3-tiered display of chilled oysters, shrimp, lobster, mussels and tuna tartare with caviar.  A bit pricey for our wallets, but it looked fabulous.  Check out the bricks over the back doorway in the kitchen. Each signed brick represents a tower sold!  Service is friendly, team service.  Nicely paced, attentive and tidy.  Lots of people milling around, ready to serve up more goodness.  I'm loving Sea Level after my first visit, and hope it's around for a while!  Go, shuckers, go!  We love you!",

I ordered the lobster roll with a side salad and the significant other order the catfish and grits. I think I enjoyed the side salad with maple-something vinaigrette the most, lobster roll was ok, lobster meet was a little tough. Catfish and grits were ok too, catfish was lightly fried and the grits were creamy. I will give this place another chance soon.",

    "text": "We enjoyed our first meal at Sea Level.  Located in the former LaVecchia's spot in Hearst Tower, we were excited to see this place filled by another seafood restaurant.  We stopped by just after they opened for dinner on a Saturday, following a show at Blumenthal.  It wasn't crowded at this time, and we were seated immediately.    The restaurant has a nice vibe.  It's decor is chic contemporary, the tables are nicely spaced, and, when we visited, they played awesome rock music (think Arctic Monkeys, Cage the Elephant, etc.).    I started with a Cat's Meow beverage (my husband had club soda).  The Cat's Meow was slightly--but not overly--sweet, and I enjoyed it very much.  Bread is extra, but just $3 a basket.  You get a decent-sized French roll, sliced and toasted, served with an onion butter.  It was delicious, and we'd likely get it again.    For appetizers, we had the clam chowder (me) and apple endive salad (him).  The clam chowder was a bit pricy for the portion ($9 for a bowl), but it was very good.  If you're a fan of thicker chowders like I am, you'll like this dish.  My husband's salad was huge, and very good.  At $10, those with lighter appetites could eat this as an entree, especially with the option of adding a protein.   For our entrees, I had the smoked trout risotto, and my husband had the mahi with beets. The trout was definitely the better value, at $18 for a huge portion.  I'm a huge fan of smoked trout, and every bite had a piece of trout.  The dish was topped with a poached egg.  While I'm not a fan of poached eggs, I do love poached egg YOLKS, so I split the egg, and mixed the yolk into the risotto.  This was a very creative dish, and I loved it!  My husband's mahi with beets tasted delicious, but it was a small plate (think just a bit bigger than tapas style) for $25.  He's not sure he'd get this again, just due to the value per portion size.  Those with lighter appetites would likely love this, however.  Overall, we enjoyed our meal and will definitely return.  Sea Level is starting lunch the first week of March, so I'll have to check them out one day when I'm in the office.",

My boyfriend and I went for restaurant week last night - please avoid this restaurant!   He started off with the smoked old fashioned cocktail - so smoky-tasting he couldn't even finish it. We both ordered off the restaurant week menu. He started with a half dozen oysters that were flavorless. I ordered the shrimp ceviche which was edible, but chewy, and a tiny portion! For his main course, he got the shrimp and grits. This also had very little flavor and was cold. The shrimp were few and far between and they looked like something you'd buy in the frozen section. My mahi mahi was a very small portion (my boyfriend joked, \"Is that going to be enough for you?\") and it was GRAY in color. I can't believe I ate it but our waiter was so MIA that I knew if I sent it back it'd be another 45 minutes before I could get anything else.   For dessert, he ordered some kind of s'mores thing which was cold when he received it. I'm pretty sure it was supposed to be hot. He joked that they could have at least put it in the microwave! I took a bite - gross. My bread pudding was okay but it was obvious that all the food was pre-made and had been sitting in a refrigerator for quite some time.  Overall, this was a beyond disappointing experience. It was extremely expensive for horrible food and terrible service. My boyfriend NEVER complains about food (truly, he would eat anything), but even he said after dinner that \"nothing about that meal was good.\" I would think that for a new restaurant, they'd be trying to entice people to come back after restaurant week. This is not a place I'll ever be frequenting again. Please do NOT eat here!",

Atmosphere is classy bar that you will want to go back to. We have been there twice... and lived in Charlotte for a week. Plan on going back to try every item on the menu.",
