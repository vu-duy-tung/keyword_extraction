Called the company number on receipt and got an apology and the promise of free meal cars. I used it recently at a Cookout near Independence. And the food was not appreciably better.   A chain I will avoid from now on; a place like Steak and Shake is much better in my opinion.",

It's obvious the night drive thru staff are rookies and it shows. Not only was our order wrong but the burgers tasted strange, food poisoning occurred during the night. The next day,(11:00 am) spoke to the manager on duty to explain  what happened the night before. He's only remark was \"sorry, he wasn't on duty then\" Great management response.....",

    "text": "Glorious day!  Cookout makes its way near south Charlotte and is better than ever.  If you've been to cookout previously, you might be familiar with the drive-thru set-up which was always the biggest annoyance for me.  I love the idea of super cheap food with amazing side items, but was driven away by the lack of indoor seating to provide me with warmth, rain cover, and lots of free soda refills.  Well Cookout heard my cries and built a mega Cookout in Pineville filled with dozens of seats and 2 full soda machines.  Hallelujah!  If you've never been to cookout, here's the run-down.  For $4.69, you get an entree (typical fast food fare and more - burgers, spicy chicken sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, chicken quesadilla), a soda, and the super kicker - 2 sides from an incredible list of choices.  We're talking about a corn dog, a cajun chicken wrap, more chicken quesadilla, chicken nuggets and so much more.  Of course you've got your standard fried fare like onion rings, fries, even hush puppies. It's like 2 meals in one.  For less than five frickin dollars.  Considering combos at mcdonalds and taco bell are now $7 these days, it's the best value in fast food, bar none.  The food itself isn't particularly remarkable but perfectly satisfying.  And for $1 more, you can switch out your drink for a milkshake, choosing from about 40 different flavors that they're happy to mix and match for you.  For instance, my recent personal creation was a cappucino peanut butter fudge shake.  Delicious!  If you've never had the pleasure, I'd recommend you come on by.  The Pineville cookout has plenty of room for you.",

It's fast food. It's nothing you tell the doctor you frequent. You will have gas. You won't spend a whole lot. I'm not putting half a menu on here if you made it this far you can look it up on their website. The foods been warm their ain no green buns or any burger king snot balls in my sandwich. I enjoy the $1 shake add on and the cheerwine floats aren't sold in stores. I will dock them a star for the drive through. I can't understand the people and they can't understand or hear me. I've gone in ordered and beat the line of cars to talk to a person so I don't have the hearing problems outside. If the line inside ain long save a quarter in gas and go in. Ain nothing wrong with 8 cars in the drive through though as they're quick and it's great for business. Stick a big double burger in one hand and a chicken wrap in the other and stopping wasting your time reading this.",

    "text": "You know I visit this Cookout quite often at least twice or more a week and I'm just not impressed.  They have only one drive thru line and are quick to toss your food out the window with little to no regard for order accuracy.  I have gotten into the habit of checking my orders before I leave the window here.  So the majority of the star rating here is on speed of service but quality and hospitality need major improvements.  This location has a dining room as well but it just replaces a normal Cookouts' walk-up window.  They do not really keep things clean and there is always sticky residue from drinks and sweet tea at the drink stations inside.  The last time I went my BBQ sandwich wasn't too hot telling me it hasn't spent long enough cooking on the char grill.  On multiple occasions they run out of sweet tea on the inside and when customers tell employees about it they have a bit of an attitude.  If this was my cookout we would have to tighten some things up.   Sweep your floor people and clean up the mess it makes us wonder about your sanitation.",

And don't get me started on the milkshakes! Over 40 flavors available. I have yet to have a flavor I didn't like. To date, my go-to flavor is \"Chocolate Cobbler!\"  Great location! Very nice inside. Plenty of parking with the adjacent shopping center.",

What I think a Big Double is and what I got are in two different worlds. The burgers were bland and tasteless. They were dry like the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. The fries were greasy with a side of grease.   I didn't receive any napkins or condiments and yes it's upsetting when you get ready to eat and have nothing to wipe your hands with. So I thank you Cookout for the terrible service, for now I know to spend my money elsewhere.",

    "text": "On my way to work running out of time I glimpsed the Cookout sign and remembering I had yet to eat today. I had been to this cookout before several times and each experience had been less desirable then the last. Reluctant to try again I turned in. The parking lot was congested with cars as it was around lunch time and the drive through line had wrapped around into the Blacklion  parking lot. I found a spot to park my car put my head down and headed in. Once inside the first thing I noticed was how empty it was. Half expecting the wait on the inside to be as long as the line was outside, it came as a pleasant surprise.  After staring at a menu that seemed to never end, I decided to order the huge make it your way hamburger. The lady at the register seemed nice but was in a hurry interrupting my order after I said each item to announce it over a blasting speaker to the workers in the back. I ordered Cajun seasoned fries and a drink to go with my burger witch also had Cajun seasoning, cheese and mayo on it. Feeling pretty good about my order and for a moment excited that I may have finally found my go to food at a Cookout, I took my cup to the soda machine got some ice (witch was crushed) and poured myself some soda and sat down at an empty table. After waiting for around five minutes the lady at the register called my order number as well as another customers order number. She sat both orders next to each other then walked away. Lucky there was a receipt stapled onto my bag of food because there was not one on the other order and grabbing the wrong bag of food could have been a disaster.  Once back at my table I sat down looked inside my bag and pulled out my tin foiled wrapped and squashed burger. Unwrapping my burger I found it to look more like a sandwich in a packed lunch that sat on its side for hours as half my burger was squashed and the other half normal. I quickly glanced at the inside to make sure it was made properly witch gladly it was, even though I struggled to find signs of mayo but it seemed present. The burger itself tasted fine even with my lack of appropriate mayo and the fries were tasty although the seasoning was only present on half of each fry.  I quickly ate my unsatisfying lunch packed up all my trash and headed out. The restaurant had picked up quiet a bit by the time I was done eating and the staff seemed to do a good job keeping tables cleaned and the place looking maintained.  I wish I had more good things to say about this restaurant for I tend to forget to eat frequently. Guess I'll just need to start packing lunches more often.",

They are normally pretty fast with the food and I have not had a mistake yet.  I like the fries, but I have to get the special seasoning on them.

I ordered at the drive thru at the absolute worst intercom ive ever heard. I had to scream my order into it and the girl STILL kept saying she couldnt hear me despite me yelling multiple times.   I pull up to the window and i hand over my card, and am quickly shoved a tray with my card almost flying off the top of it and the girl quickly closes the window, I had to quickly ask for ketchup before she completely shut it and was very quickly handed an awkward handful of ketchup. Very strange and awkward experience, no one was waiting behind me and the girl at the window acted as if her life depended on getting rid of me in under 15 seconds. Of course my order was wrong. instead of a spicy chicken sandwich i was given the most awkward burger that was just bread and 2 patties. what???? that sounds NOTHING alike. I was also given the wrong drink. again, no one was behind me so its not like I was given their order instead.  And if you really couldnt hear me yelling my order, clear as day, when no one else is in line behind me, just ask me to pull up.   I will never be back, take some lessons from the stores in the university area, they are actually well run, are friendly, get all orders right, dont make you feel like you're a burden, oh AND they are a million times busier than this location. get your crap together.",

Speaking of the food, there's a 50/50 chance of you getting your order correct, but what else do you expect from a fast food restaurant swarmed with countless teenagers? When they DO get your order right you pretty much know that you're gonna have a good day/night. Definitely go for the milkshakes (I love Oreo Mint), hush puppies, burgers, and of course the fries. The prices are great for everything but to get the most out of your money go for the tray because you can get an \"entree\", 2 sides, and a large drink or huge tea. Plus when you get the tray you can upgrade for a milkshake for $1 extra! So if your about that fast food life DEFINITELY try out Cook Out!",

    "text": "One of the better Cook Out locations because it has an inside area like a standard fast food restaurant. It gets hit hard at lunch time and rush hour in the evening. The inside seems to never stay especially clean and tidy. Staff is nicer here than some other locations but it seems unanimous amongst most fast food employees that they hate their jobs.  Lots of food variety including burgers, chicken sandwiches (grilled and fried), fries and even quesadillas to name just a few. They're most well known for their milkshakes but these days I find it hard to stomach an entire one. They sell only one size and it's a pint. They should consider offering a 12oz option. The parking lot and drive through are difficult to navigate and a bit treacherous. The flow of traffic causes a lot of congestion.",

The only reason I would come here is if it's 2am and I'm drunk. Although the strawberry milkshake was pretty good. They got 2 stars instead of 1 because of the milkshake. Didn't like any of the food.",

The last two times we have went, my daughter was looking forward to a surprise burger meal, the order was made wrong and in one case forgotten. With a very busy drive up location i don't want to hold up the line by double checking everything but I guess I have to now!",
