I shouldn't have been surprised there was a line only :30 min after opening. I'm not one for lines... The day before I paid for Express Lane passes at Carowinds! But, I can honestly say, the wait is worth it. Just be patient and it goes pretty steadily. It's actually quite impressive for a one man show.   Order: The Life Changer, Q-Dog and Fritto Pie Dog. Even if you'd never dream of eating 3 hotdogs, order them all and have a few bites of each. You won't regret it!!!",

    "text": "Just when you think you've already had the best dogs in charlotte you run into chiliman.  What I think I like most - and find most unique - is that he puts fried cheese on a lot of his dogs. He will throw a pile of shredded cheese on the grill and let it cook until crispy. He will then lay that down on the bun and proceed to layer on the other toppings. The added texture works really well - plus it helps keep the bun from getting soggy.   As others have said, Vic is a riot. I asked for the \"Life Changer\" dog and he replied with \"that it will my friend\". I then asked if he had any other dogs he recommended. After a long pause he tipped me off to a \"hidden\" dog that's not on his menu. Think \"Life Changer\" with a Cajun twist. Both dogs were really really good!    He also serves up a really tasty chicken taco as well if he's offering it on the menu. Another must try if you ever find yourself at chiliman's food cart.   The homemade sauces are over the top good. My favorite was the blueberry but they were all really good.",

I'll stop by a few times a week. Make sure to select one of Vic's specialty sauces (homemade). I like to have a combination of sauces. Mixing some of the Spicy, BBQ, and sweet sauces, you create this explosion of flavor.   The perfect combination, order: Heroin Dog (it's on the menu!) a few of us awhile back founded the creation of that dog; its flavor became popular. You want to have Vic's homemade chili, fried cheese, Naco Sauce, a BBQ and a Sweet/mango sauce, topped with chopped onions and extra shredded cheese. I can not emphasize enough that a simple hot dog just isn't going to cut it anymore. Vic sets a new standard!   If you like Hot Dogs, the Chili Man is the way to go! Nothing else compares.",

I was expecting a delicious home-made chili, and sauerkraut...DENIED!  The kraut was out of the bag and the chili (tasted out of the can) had beans in it...YUCK!! I was expecting SO much more.  I didn't try one of his sauce varieties because I didn't want my taste buds to be confused.  I'll say if you want a creative dog, stop by!

This was my first trek and my only \"negative\" is that it took a little bit to get our food (and in his defense, it was his first day open for the season) but when something is good - others find out about it and it's typically worth the wait!  I wasn't disappointed!  Got two dogs and a bottle of water for $7.  I got the Heroin and the Life Changer.  Typically I can't comment on Heroin but I can tell you this hot dog is quite addicting, and that the Life Changer, was in fact life changing!  I was advised in line to not look like a rookie and go with the \"named dogs\", btw.  Look forward to getting back and enjoying this experience again!",

There is also the problem of deciding what you want since the menu is so delicious and you can't really go wrong with any choice - even build your own.  I had the Naco and the Heroin.... both of them were gone in 60 seconds.  Since Vic is a one man show, you can see how much love and personality he puts into all his hot dogs... which is unique when you think of a \"hot dog cart\" on the street.  Definitely a great staple to add to your Uptown Charlotte experience.    Even after my dogs were secured in my belly, I was watching Vic interact with the customers and everyone definitely walks away with a smile and one hell of a chili dog.  There is a lot to be said in putting pride into your work and it definitely pays of for the Chili Man.  I've never seen a hot dog vendor chop a fresh onion (most are pre-prepared or soaking in liquid for who knows how long), but that's just one of the man details that this man puts into his creations.",

Everything Vic serves is top notch, starting with the buns, to the dogs, to the condiments (especially the spicy mustard and ketchup he makes himself), to the toppings.  But the real star of the show is the chili.  We're not talking browned meat with a little sauce here.  We're talking about chili that is loaded with meat, beans, spices, and flavor.  Chili that travels the region and wins prizes at festivals.  Chili that has been crafted and refined over a lifetime.  Chili that will make you slap your mama!  But wait, there's more!  You don't just get a great meal, you'll get entertainment, too.  Vic is a heck of a personable guy, and none to shy.  Depending on the time of day the line can grow a little long.  But it's always well worth the wait, and Vic's hospitality will make the time fly by.  So treat yourself when you are downtown.  You'll be glad you did!",

    "text": "I remember last year when someone joked about leaving a 4-star review for Chili Man. The typical jovial light fell from Vic's eyes as he stared down the errant patron. His throat uttered an inhuman growl, with the clearly discernible words \"I will cut you\" flowing forth from his lips.  Oh wait, that guy may have been me. It'd be really brave and edgy to give these chili dogs 4-stars to break the hot streak, but at the end of the day it'd be just incorrect. Regardless of threats of bodily harm (not serious in case you're wondering) the ratings are here for a reason.  I won't repeat too much of what other people have said, but it's pretty crazy that Vic's been able to elevate tube meat to this level of an art form. However I will say some things that are important to note before you decide to try a dog:  * There are non-spicy options that are sublime, but I do believe that in general the spicy options are your best bet. * Because of the large amount of ingredients and his mouth, if there's a line there will also be a wait. Expect about 4 minutes per person in front of you. I consider it worth it when there's  less than 6 people in front. Please don't be the guy who orders 10  dogs for the office. Get them to come with you outside. * This is a street dog. It's served from a grandfathered in open hot dog cart. Vic wears gloves most the time and uses hand sanitizer. If you're expecting clean-room food... first why are you getting a hot dog, and second this place isn't for you. HOWEVER let me be clear - I've probably eaten at least 50 hot dogs from here (oh god) and have never seen or experienced anything untoward in regards to food safety. Just an FYI. * If you want to know of specials, locations, and if Vic's even gonna be out on the street, you should check FB.",

    "text": "Vic, aka \"the Chili Man\" has been serving hot dogs out of a mobile hot dog stand for almost 3 years now. While we've seen a lot of mobile vendors appearing downtown in that time, none of them come close to the Chili Man in terms of quality or taste.  He's not called \"the Chili Man\" for nothing. His homemade chili is award-winning stuff, garnering prizes at multiple local and state chili cook-offs. It's so good you could eat it by the gallon. (And if you let him know in advance, he'll sell you a gallon so you can give it a try.)  Vic toasts his buns, uses high-quality dogs, and also makes his own spicy mustard. He has all the toppings you could want, including slaw, cheese, and kraut. He even makes a great chicken salad that you can get on a croissant. (Not available every day.)  On top of all that, he's got a great personality and is a blast to talk to while he's making your dogs. He's only there from 11-3pm on Wednesdays and Fridays, so you need to plan ahead.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and proclaim this the best dog in Charlotte. Seriously.",

The former had delicious homemade chili (thick, meaty, spicy, tasty with beans) and a delicious spicy mustard.  The latter had homemade BBQ sauce, tasty coleslaw, onions and perhaps some cheese.  Can't remember for sure.  Both were incredibly good.  I'll not forget that chili any time soon, and I'll be back for more.  Everything was top quality -- buns, dogs and condiments.  And, as others have mentioned, the Chili Man has a way with people.  Very engaging guy.  I love to patronize businesses like this.",

A good sign of an amazing food cart is the crowd it attracts. This is a place where you'll see all the people of Uptown; businesspeople that work in the local companies but also construction workers, parking enforcement, and even tourists on Segways will stop by and talk to Vic if not order a dog from him. There was a guy today that had a box just so that he could carry hot dogs back to his office.  Vic is a friendly guy with a very good sense of humor and will talk with you as you're waiting in line for your hot dogs. These aren't just plain jane hot dogs (although if you want, you can get that) but amazing gourmet quality hotdogs at a plain jane price. I mean, where else can you get 3 loaded hotdogs for $9.75 for lunch in Uptown? Today's special was a peanut butter and homemade bacon jam hot dog and I don't think I'll get anything like that ever again anywhere else. Who would've thought that those two things go together? I mean, this is probably sacrilege to say but I thought that bacon jam was better than the one I had at the Ashbury. Plus that chili was amazing on the other dogs that I had (backslide and the life changer) and I wouldn't mind having just a cup or a bowl of that chili on its own. I will definitely be back later!",

His ability to combine so many amazing flavors and textures on top of a tasty grilled hot dog and toasted bun is what makes his food so incredibly delicious. I have tried other hot dog stands in and around town, but none of them even compares to the quality and taste of the Chili Man.   Vic is extremely outgoing and friendly - kind of like lunch and a show - he is quick witted and quite entertaining! Even though the line can be pretty long during peak times, it has always been well worth the wait.",

I was finally able to have him come down during his lunch break for some of these amazing hot dogs.   The Chili Man hot dog stand is parked right in front of Chima's steakhouse Tuesday-Friday from 11a-2p. There will be a line, but don't let it deter you. Not only are the dogs delicious but Vic is friendly and funny. Despite the fact that you'll be waddling away after chowin down and may need a food coma nap afterwards, the Chili Man experience is worth it. JUST DO IT, as I will tell you in the next paragraph, even vegans don't have an excuse.   What really had me sold was Vic now has vegetarian friendly tofu dogs! Seriously most thoughtful hot dog vendor EVER! I walked over with my bf just expecting him to fulfill his craving, I wasn't going to get anything since the last uploaded menu on yelp only consisted of red meat hot dogs. But to my surprise I was able to have one too, I was so happy! AND the Chili Man even offers VEGAN Chili Wednesdays complete with vegan hot dogs and TVP chili. So rad.   Ok I'll stop raving now.. Lol so my boyfriend had the life changer and I had a vegetarian friendly life changer with a tofu dog and minus the chili. We didn't talk to each other while eating, hell, I don't even think we took a breath. That's how good the Chili Man dogs are. All in all, the Chili Man is THE man and his dogs are righteous. Goes without saying he will be seeing me every week..which brings me to my next quest...I need to find a good gym.   Cheers!",

Man.....it's obvious why he is one of the best rated \"restaurants\" in Charlotte.  Vic the Chili Man operates out of a cart with an umbrella. It's typically set up in Uptown a little down from Trade and Tryon. Honestly, if he is there, you can't miss it cause there will be a line. Wait in said line, it's worth it.  Vic is a pretty cool guy. I couldn't help but crack a smile while he was talking and entertaining us while we waited. He makes each dog perfectly, including even toasting the buns. I mean, who does that?!?  I ordered the specialty dog of the day, the Stupid Black Garlic Dog (I only got one cause I had eaten have of salad mentioned above). The dog had a black bean chili, brie, some black garlic sauce of deliciousness. Heck, there could have been something else on there. I dont know. It was just amazing. I mean, it was a Guy Fieri style of bending over so you don't get your shirt messy while eating this amazingness of a hot dog. This dog was $3.50 too!!  Vic is the real deal.",

I agree with Nikki W, it's strange that a Yelp Elite is bestowing 5 stars on a hot dog vendor. Well you better believe it!   First off, he is a super nice and friendly guy! He knows his regulars and jokes with them. He engages the new customers. Word has it, that Cam Newton eats there at least once a week. I thought Cam was a pescatarian but if anything is going to make him turn to the dark side of beef, it would be the Chili Man's hot dogs.   Every week, he has specials and they are interesting takes on a ballpark snack. His regular menu is amazing itself. Next time I go, I am trying the Vinegar dog which is dill pickles, saurkraut, jalepenos, and mustard for toppings. The chili dog is also amazing and I could eat about ten of them. If you are reading this, try it out! Its worth your wile!",

There is good conversation between Vic and customers in line as the dogs are made.  In no time, the dogs were in my hand.  Two dogs and a water for ~$7 isn't bad at all.  The chili has beans and peppers so don't expect \"hot dog chili.\"  However, it has a good taste and a nice spice.The pimento cheese helped to cool it down.  Very good.  I had asked Vic to add the spicy mustard to the southern dog but there was some confusion because I think he added the spicy ketchup.  It blended with the chili and almost made a sloppy joe flavor.  Not bad but not exactly what I was expecting.  I really liked the slaw he uses too.  I'll definitely return to Chili Man next time I'm in the Uptown area for lunch.",

    "text": "So, I finally found Vic the Chili Man. And I love him.   I got the Nacho Dog - best. idea. ever.I can't even describe how excited I was when he put the cheese right on the grill top. OMG. delicious. The dogs are cheap, compared to the experience. He takes credit cards, with no minimum. And the line is worth the wait.   Vic is so friendly and welcoming, that you feel like you've known him forever. He talks you through the line, so don't despair, get in on the conversation. Its obvious that he loves what he does, and loves the people that he meets. He's one of those people that you never have to think twice about saying hello to, you say hello and then chat for 20 mins about New York or Amsterdam. Seriously, we chatted about both yesterday. He's the guy that you go to get a dog, and bring your family and friends to meet Vic.   After my experience here, I'm not surprised at all that he has such good reviews, or such a long line. You can't blame people!! Vic is fantastic.",

I have never had a better hot dog at home, or another venue.  Vic, the proprietor and chef, is always fun, as he serves up his witty banter and dogs. The cooking is always on point.   There are homemade sauces, and he frequently offers a special recipe dog so that you can try something different.  The Life Changer is my go to order.  I advise getting there early, because the line can get to be a bit absurd. It is very convenient, that he also takes Square payments.",

While walking down Tryon I saw the line already forming at 11 and knew exactly what was going on. Even though you may have to wait a bit, Vic provides an experience that is worth the wait. On this particular day he was spinning stories about winning big at high stakes bingo on a recent Disney cruise he took with his family (not a huge surprise considering his mickey mouse T-shirt that matched his tattoos), but talking with others around me this is the kind of light hearted funny banter you can expect from Vic. Then there are the hot dogs. His names are none other than creative, and I ended up ordering three hot dogs since I'm never in uptown at this time. The Frito Dog I ordered was definitely my favorite followed closely by his hot dog of the day with bacon and mac-n-cheese. The fact he grills his dogs and buns and has some amazing home sauces creates a unique flavor. In the midst of the Charlotte gourmet hot dog movement, Vic is certainly worth a visit.",

I don't know what kind of wizardry Vic does, but I didn't know hot dogs could taste so good.   For anyone working in uptown, do yourself and go here for lunch. I've had too many disappointing meals costing me at least $13 each time. You'll spend half that here, treat your taste buds, and you're guaranteed to get some interesting convos with Vic!",

The special dog with max snd cheese was also good, but not quite as impressive. Vic is also an excellent showman. The only caveat, which I did not see mentioned in most other reviews, is that the line is very long. There were about ten people ahead of me when I arrived, and I had to wait over half an hour in intense heat. The food ended up being worth the wait, but it may not be practical to eat here if one is in a hurry.",

This is about as gourmet of a hot dog as you can get while still be totally laid back and casual.   I don't work Uptown anymore, so unfortunately for me that means less trips to see Vic. When he posted his specials today, I knew that I had to head uptown for lunch.  Special #1: Mac 'n cheese, chili & crumbled bacon. Special #2: peanut butter & his homemade bacon jam.  That homemade bacon jam is truly out of this world --- Vic, pleasssssse start to use this on a more regular basis. It would be a great accompaniment to many of your existing dogs.  Keep innovating the hot-dog world and putting that Vic man 'soul' into each of your ideas!",

The man who runs this stand is incredibly friendly and seems to want to create an experience for his guests and not just push them through as I've experienced at other stands. If you are in line at a hot dog stand for 15+ minutes and people are not getting out of line there is a reason for that.   He quickly worked on my order as we chatted about Yelp and local restaurants. Food was bagged up I grabbed my soda and found a nearby bench.  As I opened my mouthwatering deliciousness that sat before me, I couldn't wait to try it. I started with the Frito Pie. Simply amazing!! Followed by The Life Changer, and I do think I saved the best for last. The life changer is a perfect combo on flavors that just work perfectly together.   If I have time on this trip I'll definitely be back for more!!",

Are you having a bad day at work? Go find Vic and get a hotdog. I have enjoyed the 10 minute break of food heaven for the time I've been in Charlotte.  It all started when the work crew came back from his cart carry his dogs. And ohhh man did they smell good.  After a little bit of hunting around on Tryon I found him, \"and the well deserved line\".  If you don't get there when he opens up, there will be a line. Vic does his best to tweet/Facebook out when he will be around, but it's best if you go for a walk and look for his huge green patio umbrella.  And yes......  It's That Good",

This is the definition of torture.  I know what you're thinking, 300 reviews and she's giving 5 stars to a hot dog street vendor?! Vic is a lot more than that. He takes great pride in making quality toppings and creative menu options. On top of great food, he is a one man show. If there's a line, it is completely worth the wait. From his stories and anecdotes, to the menu descriptions and Chili Man facts, you'll have a giant smile on your face the entire time. You can't possibly have a bad day when you see Vic.  On to the food, he has different specials during the week. Follow him on Facebook and Twitter to see what he's got cooking. #SeeWhatIDidThere. Vic has told me for weeks that I need to get the Life Changer. I don't want to say a hot dog changed my life, but hot damn I do believe it did. It definitely deserves that name. Cheese, chili, Chili Man's designer taco sauce, homemade spicy mustard, jalapenos and onion. HOLY. Like, holy should be in 72 pt font. I also got a dog with kraut and homemade spicy mustard. It took a lot of restraint to only eat two hot dogs.  Things to know: don't see something on the named menu you like? Don't worry, you can build your own. Dogs come with unlimited toppings. Say what?! He does take a credit card. Don't work uptown and need a place to park? I like to park a couple blocks away on Poplar between 3rd and 4th streets. There are meters here and it's way cheaper than the parking decks. Don't have change? Use the park mobile app. Takes all of maybe ten seconds to park and pay. And trust me, you'll be thankful for that little walk back to your car after the dogs.  Review #300 is in the books. Here's to the next 300!",

He's been featured on Thrillst too, if you're not already convinced to try him!  Vic makes and invents all his sauces to go on his crazy Hot Dog creations. His most famous Hot Dog is the Frito Pie Dog, which has taco sauce, grilled cheddar, chili, onions, jalapeno, onion infused sour cream, and crumbled Fritos on top...talk about flavor town.  He loves to try new things when it comes to his creations and takes recommendations from fans and loyal visitors. While he had a wide selection of dogs that never change, he usually does a handful of specials throughout each season. I'm a huge fan of Corn in the USA, which was a special this year that was essentially Mexican Street Corn in a Hot Dog -- wow!!   His energy is contagious and he's so entertaining to listed to while you wait for your Hot Dog. I would try to get to him a bit early in your lunch hour, as the line can get quite long.",

    "text": "In the words of Vic the Chili Man: \"What took you so long?\". As I write this review that keeps playing over and over. Why did it take me so long to try Vic's amazing hotdog creations???   With this being Vic's 16th season I'm definitely late to the party and as a Charlotte native there is no excuse for this.   I will say that before the fall of last year I rarely spent time downtown but my volunteer work has me downtown at least once if not twice a week now and I know where I will be grabbing lunch for now on!   For my first visit I made sure I did my research. I explored the menu, asked friends for recommendations of their favorite dogs and learned that the wait was nothing to be intimidated by but to still go early.   Well at 11am there was already a wait. I waited for about 20 minutes. The wait was very fun! Vic has hilarious stories and shares about his kids, the weather, the parking fun (trouble downtown) and so much more. This all made the wait so much easier.   I was convinced that I would try the Naco Dog but wasn't sure of the other dog I would get. I was hesitant to try the Dog Au Poivre avec Frite. One I'm a stickler for pronouncing things correctly and two it scared me with it's mix of flavors for the sauce. But I took a gamble and ordered it. Boy am I happy I did, it was AMAZING. I could have easily eaten 2 of those dogs. Now I'm convinced that I have to at-least try Vic's specials cause this guy is a genius when it comes to mixing flavors.   The Dog Au Poivre avec Frite has just enough of the creamy sauce to keep the hot dog moist and the potatoes sticks mixed with the bacon give the dog a great crunch. The Naco dog was cold by the time I ate it but it was still good. The idea of grilled cheese at the base of the hotdog is genius but Vic is a genius so it's only fitting. Still not sure what Taco juice is but I'll delve into that on my second visit.   Vic the Chili Man S Tryon, Charlotte, NC 28202 Wednesday March 13, 2019 11:15am",

    "text": "What more can be said about this dude cooking hot dogs on the side of the street? I looked up Chili Man after reading about him in Money Magazine as the NUMBER ONE hot dog in America. Naturally, I had to check it out being in Charlotte.   We got near the hotdog cart and my girlfriend goes \"wonder what this lines for?\" Yup. We had arrived. We scoured the daily menu for about 40 minutes while we stood in line.   As you get closer you can start to hear the conversations he was having with the customers. This dude sounds like he has done it all and seen it all. He was personalizing every conversation based on a question he would ask or a comment a customer would make. That's something that missing from a lot of small transactions. Very much appreciated.   The hot dogs were of course delicious. I got the life changer + relish and it delivered 100%. It had some heat with the jalapenos and his taco sauce, and some sweetness with the onions and relish. That with the grilled cheese and toasted bun? Perfect.   I came because of the article but I'll go back because of the quality dog and quality guy. Can't wait",

He also has meal deals, chips, and various drinks to pick from. I was drooling with excitement with the thought of the Frito pie dog. I couldn't wait to dig in!

Well, I finally went - and now I am officially a fan. I'm not quite sure how he comes up with his combos but I can honestly say they are genius. Hands down the best one is the Pho-Q dog. I wish I could explain exactly what it tastes like but it's like a flavor explosion of yum in your mouth finished with the slightly salty dog at the end.   To top it off, the prices are reasonable. You can rarely find lunch uptown for less than $10. Two hot dogs, chips and a drink - very filling.   The owner was pretty comical which made up for the line being so long. He could definitely stand to make his operations more efficient with the use of electronic order placing system while people stand in line. BUT with all that said, he is still very charismatic. He even goes as far to guarantee that if you don't like your order, to replace it for free with something else.   Overall, 5 star experience.",

My colleague has been talking nonstop about Chili Man and so when he saw the cart up today with a line of only about 7 people, he came upstairs to get me so I could see what all the fuss was about.   We got to the back of the line and Chili Man immediately recognized and said hello to my colleague. While we looked over his menu (beef hotdogs, veggie dogs and brats) with all of the special toppings, we listened to Chili Man chat with the other customers. His energy is awesome, and between that and his positivity you can tell he's an awesome person...   Back to the food! My colleague got the daily special which has buttered paprika breadcrumbs, onion, jalapeno and a homemade chimmichurri sauce, and The Heroin. They were $3.50 each so his total was $7. He takes card! I got The Life Changer on a brat ($4.50) and chips and a drink from the cooler ($2.50). When I tell you this is by far the absolute best hotdog I've EVER had I'm only saying that because I don't know how to better describe it. Update: I just walked back down for a SECOND time because I made the mistake of only getting one   Chili Man makes his own unique sauces & Chili and the line today was FULL of his regular customers. One guy took a scooter from a mile or so away just to see if the cart was here! Chili Man gets 5 stars and two thumbs up from me!",

I found him last year just before he retired for the winter, and now that he's back this spring, have been to see him 2x a week. I'm all set to try every dog on his menu.... but always seem to reel in a Frito Pie. Call me an addict, I guess.  His prices are not to be beat on the street, and unlike most street vendors uptown, he's prepared to work with more than just cash.  Just prepare for a bit of time spent in line, 20+ mins most days, but he will be sure to keep you entertained the entire time in line with his banter back and forth with clients and passers by. He's a one-man show and if you pass him by while hungry, that's your loss!  Keep on bringin' the dogs, Vic! Thanks!!",

To heck with that. I got news for you: Chili Man wasn't just hibernating over the Winter. When Vic wasn't working on his SHRED fundraiser, helping families with extraordinary medical needs, he was in the trenches of the kitchen coming up with borderline-insane menu concoctions.  Just how many slam dunk combinations can you put on a Hot Dog? Take my advice, don't get him started!  The Mac & Cheese & Chili & Bacon dog is a fine example. It's a huge fan favorite and only comes up as a special a few weeks in the season. How could you possibly add anything to this without it getting lost in the other flavors? How about looking at texture first, then backing that up with supreme taste: Parmesan and Garlic flavored Panko bread Crumbs to top it off. Do I have your attention now?  Last week he was going Canadian with this awesome Beer Cheese and Potato Stix on top. The week before that was a \"No Snail Escargot Dog\" that had button mushrooms to die for. I've got a feeling that we haven't seen the end of these international flashes of brilliance.  The flowers are blooming, the last frost of the winter is (hopefully) behind us, and that crazy, 'almost family friendly' guy on Tryon St is still at it. If you had a hot dog for lunch and it wasn't from Chili Man's cart, then I'm sorry, it was a boring dog compared to this.  Keep on keepin' on.",

The line was short but only because it was 1pm (expect a wait). Vic was hilariously entertaining, personable and passionate.   He recommended two hotdogs as a first timer:  1. Nacho Dog - The dog that started the revolution! Grilled cheddar cheese, chili taco juice. 1/2 dog, 1/2 taco, 1/2 nachos. 150% awesome  2. Chili Man's Choice - all beef dog with reaper madness mustard, cheddar cheese and chili   His choices are vast and I will certainly be back soon!",

    "text": "I was hesitant to try The Chili Man's Choice because the mustard on it is \"The Carolina Reaper Madness\". To me that sounded like something out of an episode of fear factor, but between Vic's charm and a friend of mine who is a regular, I folded. I'm a sucker for mustard. Oh man! This mustard has just enough of the pepper to put a spring in your step. The magical chili mingled with that and the perfectly cooked hotdog and the toasted bun had me hooked and wanting to get back in line for a second one, only I had a Mac & Cheese Chili dog waiting for me.  I have a weakness for mustard but nothing compares to my compulsion for ordering Mac and Cheese. OH MAN! I was not disappointed. This Chili guy must be some kind of wizard. He ruined all other dogs for me with just those two. I can't wait until he's back in the spring for me to try more.",

After waiting around 30 minutes for a single hot dog (waited too long to give up), I finally picked up my order and was left very unimpressed. The dog was absolutely nothing special and the mix of flavorings somehow ended up making the whole thing taste bland.  Seems like a super nice guy but If you must try it because of the hype, I recommend drawing straws and having a a single coworker grab the orders, as the \"show\" and a pricey hotdog isn't worth wasting 30+ minutes on.",

On my last week traveling down to the Queen City, my colleague and I were on our way to the usual Dean and Deluca lunch when I spotted the Chili Man and thought - dude, if I don't try the top rated Yelp \"restaurant\" before I leave this place I'm not a real Yelper.    My colleague is vegetarian, and the Chili Man has veggie dogs and veggie chili (sometimes!).    I got the two chili dog combo with chips and a soda for $7.75 - great bang for your buck.  I went with the Vinegar bomb and the Life Changer.  Best damn chili dogs I've had.  The vinegar bomb has some of my favorite hot dog stuffs - chili, sauerkraut, pickles, and pickled jalapenos.  Those who love your sour veggies would love this.  The Life Changer was pretty life changing indeed.  I'm a spice lover and this did not disappoint.  The addition of the \"fried cheese\" sounded weird, but made for a delicious combo.  I'd get both of these again.  I'd also like to make a note that the Chili Man is super cool.  He's a no-BS kind of guy who is very friendly and chatted it up with me and my colleague while he put his love into our food.  I like to support people like him who run small business - keep it up, Chili Man!  Forget your diet - these dogs are the real deal.",

Don't let the line scare you cause these dogs are certainly worth the wait and you will have to wait so show up earlier vs. later and don't go if you're in a hurry that day. The Frito Pie dog is my favorite on the menu followed by the Life Changer so at the minimum order those two. Bring your appetite and order the daily special as your third. He's always whippin up something super creative that will surely have you coming back. I'm off to get in line for another dog.",

    "text": "When I first started working Uptown I wanted to get a \"street hotdog\" since I had always associated the downtown life with a great frank (don't ask me why, maybe too many movies). On my third day on the job I went to find a hotdog stand and was successful. However, it was just a plain jane hot dog with a little ketchup and mustard. Good but not really anything to look forward to again.  Fast forward a few weeks. I am walking the streets of Tryon looking for something to inspire my palette because I'm in one of those rare moods where I just can't decide what I'm hankering for.  I came across the Chili Man stand on Tryon between 4th and Trade and saw a few people ordering and being chatted up by the owner. Loving verbal engagement I wandered over and stood in line meanwhile listening to a random story being recounted by the Chili Man himself. There are essentially two main options on the menu: Hotdogs and Brats. Fortunately I happen to like both and ordered one of each.  Then I got to pick my toppings for my meal. For my brat I just got brown mustard and Sauerkraut (major kudos for even offering a brat with kraut, which is surprisingly rare). I took my dog based on his recommendation which included spicy mustard, spicy ketchup, chili and cheese.  I will say both were great but the chili just put things over the edge. It did not seem like a generic canned chili and I have been told (though not confirmed) that he makes it himself. It would not surprise me. It does not matter if you don't have cash because he is up on the digital age and can accept credit cards.  So the food is fantastic but one thing that makes you want to come back and what puts this place at the top of my Uptown lunch list (besides the chili) is Vic \"the Chili Man\" himself. I do not think this man has ever met a stranger. He always has a great story or conversation topic that has nothing to do with the weather, sports or politics. It is refreshing to say the least. If you are ever in a downcast mood, this man can lift your spirits with a good conversation or story. He is not intentional about it, it is just who he is.  Come for the dogs, hang around the cart for the conversation. Be prepared to repeat.",

Coolest thing is all toppings are included in the very reasonable price so whatever you want its good.  Great guy to chat with and just an overall great spot.  Thanks for the email Yelp!

The name of the dog, much to my surprise, is such a huge understatement. The most delicious hot dog I think I will ever have. I Definitely recommend the experience to anyone with taste buds. Vic, if you're reading this, you have made a new fan.",

    "text": "I'm not sure if the \"chili man\" is the most appropriate name for Vic because ALL of his hot dogs are good, and not just the ones with chili. He's an entertaining guy as others have said, genuinely cares about his customers, and he always provides awesome dogs with great service.  My favorite part is the dogs come exactly as you like. While there is a list of the famous \"named\" dogs, you can change or add unlimited toppings to them for no extra charge, and he'll make things exactly as you like. Want a TON of spicy mustard? No problem. Just a little BBQ sauce? Same deal. He even asked me if I wanted the BBQ sauce on my \"Q Dog\" to be spicy, sweet, or fruity and how much.  The hot dogs and buns are solid quality, but what sets the Chili Man apart are his toppings. The chili is really beefy, flavorful, fresh, and clearly not from a can. The spicy mustard is awesome, the slaw is vinegary but just slightly sweet, the taco sauce is good..I could go on and on about every topping, but the point is they're great. If your dog has \"fried cheese\" he even puts a little cheddar cheese directly on the griddle to crisp up before adding it to the dog which is perfect.  Go to the Chili Man, order a few hot dogs depending on how hungry you are (I'm partial to the life changer with extra mustard if you like fairly spicy things), pay the cheap price, thank Vic, and enjoy your killer lunch.",

I recommend the Naco dog, which has grilled cheese (literally, cheese put directly on the grill until crisp and placed lovingly into the hot dog bun). You can't go wrong here, I promise. GO!",
