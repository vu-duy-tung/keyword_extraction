    "text": "Few things are better than an arepa - let alone an arepa bar.  As mentioned in other reviews, arepas are made from 100% corn, but they are nothing like a tortilla. In Colombia, they are served plain or with toppings and in Venezuela they are stuffed - but the arepa is generally the same.   Arepas Grill offers the Venezuelan style. The cafe is simple, no frills - just great, fresh food served by nice people. I highly recommend trying the juices with water too. Note, don't go in a rush, expect food to take 15 minutes to prepare.",

    "text": "Arepas Grill is an unique restaurant that serves genuinely Venezuelan and Colombian food. I am originally from Venezuela, and this place reminded how much I miss the food of my country. I had the Reina Pepiada Arepa (Avocado,Chicken and mayonnaise) and it was excellent. I believe they have fair prices since with only one arepa ($7.50) I was completely full. The staff was wonderful explaining us the food and the service was quick (between 5-10 min to receive the food). I strongly recommend this place to any American who wants to try some unique food or any Venezuelan/Colombian that misses their food! 5/5!",

    "text": "Since moving to Charlotte, I have been on a hunt to find places to satisfy the random cravings of my Denver staples. One of those cravings are arepas from the Quiero Arepas food truck. If you ever find yourself in Denver, make sure you track them down! So, I found Arepas Grill (thanks, Yelp!) and I headed down to check them out. Just a note... The street address on Yelp is wrong. It is located at 4740 Old Pineville Rd #A. Right next to it's sister restaurant, Colombian Bakery. I walked in and the place was empty. No seriously, there weren't any employees... I waited for a solid three minutes until someone showed up to help me out. Which was fine, as it gave me time to look over the menu. I decided on the Carne Mechada arepa ($6.00) and maracuya (passion fruit) drink ($3.00). He took my order and disappeared to the back. He reappeared a bit later with a freshly made arepa. He proceeded to cut it open and stuff it with the shredded beef and cheese. I asked for the spicy, avocado sauce that I am accustomed to having my arepa served with. The passion fruit drink was awesome! Very fresh tasting and refreshing. I'm on the fence about the arepa. I like how fresh the arepa itself was, but I wasn't really impressed with the fillings. It was definitely tasty, but I am used to my arepas being fixed up with more than just meat and cheese. A little more garnish would have put them over the top! This place could definitely earn the fourth, and even fifth, star easily with a little bit of improvement. They should take a look at Quiero Arepas menu! I would be psyched if they added something like the La Havana to their menu! I'll visit Arepas Grill next time an arepa craving strikes!",

    "text": "Yay, arepas! I hit up this place on a chilly Saturday afternoon while I was out and about and hungry.  When I walked in the first thing I noticed was that the it smelled really delicious inside the restaurant. The place is in an odd little strip mall next to the train tracks and it has zero atmosphere, but the minute I smelled what was going on in there I did not care one bit. I started my arepa explorations with a Pelua, which is beef and gouda cheese. I'm going to go ahead and say that that was the most delicious thing that I've put in my mouth in Charlotte so far this year. A vegetarian arepa (the La Del Gato) with cheese, plantains and avocado was also pretty tasty, although it could have used more plantains and less avocado for balance and flavor. The fresh cheese is out of this world, though. I will definitely be going back. It sounds like this place is doing well, too -- the guy working the counter said he was still cleaning up after a massive lunch rush when I got there just before 2.",

    "text": "Truly, this would be 3.5 stars, but I digress. I ordered the Reina Pepeada for$6.50 after being offered a taste. Delicioso! It is an arepa stuffed full of a chicken, avocado,mayo & cilantro blend. Creamy and cool, perfect for a warm summer day,   You order, pay, and then have a seat while they prepare your arepa. 5 minutes later, your lunch is brought out, warm and toasty.  I really enjoyed my lunch, and so did my Wife and daughter (they had their own, I don't share). A couple of negatives: a little pricey. And not flexible for people who might not want a specific ingredient. For instance, anything with avocado has it mixed in, so you don't have the option to order without it. I don't eat beans, so I couldn't order my first choice because the beans were mixed in with the meat. Not a deal breaker for me, but picky eaters might have a problem. My next visit might bring this to a stronger 4 stars, we will see.",

The hours of operation are not followed diligently. They are changed sometimes without notice and it's really disappointing to drive all the way from somewhere and find the place is closed during their normal business hours! While I realize sometimes businesses use Facebook to notify clients, not everyone in the world is on their Facebook page and really limits the ability of new clients to understand their actual business hours.",

Arepas are corn tortillas stuffed with various meats, cheeses, etc. and grilled.    My Arepas was a great value, generously stuffed with beef and cheese and nicely seasoned. A great value for $6.25.   After getting some assistance from the staff I chose the seasoned beef and gouda, a top seller. The menu offers several arepa choices as well as fresh squeezed juices with water or milk.  My passion fruit and water juice was delicious and took me back to my Cabo vacation several years ago!

The empanada filling could use a bit more seasoning but the guasacaca sauce certainly helps. In fact, I wish I'd gotten two of them because it was really good. It's now my second favorite sauce after the guajillo sauce at another local place. As for the arepa, it was excellent. You can't go wrong with avocado and cilantro. The portions are generous and very filling. Their prices are affordable. Others have mentioned the wait can be long, but I didn't mind it at all. Latin cultures are much more relaxed so I anticipated it. I highly recommend and will definitely visit again!",

I use to stop by early on my way to work and get a load of baked goods for my workplace crew, and it was always a hit.    While I've been there upwards of 30 times, I haven't tried many of the full meals, and the pan de queso was a disappointment compared to the NYC versions I've had.  The bunuelos can occasionally sit too long and lose their crispiness, which is one of the saddest things I can imagine.  Still if I am driving by, it's hard not to stop and get some goodies.",

    "text": "I got turned onto this place from the Cooking Channel Show \"Eden Eats.\" Eden herself is a touch spastic and really needs to lay off the Red Bull, but the show is interesting and covers mostly ethnic places off the beaten path. One show took place in Charlotte and featured arepas from the Antojitos mi Colombia bakery.   Arepas are made from pre cooked corn flour, hand molded into disks, pan fried and then baked. They can be split open and filled with all manners of deliciousness and served sandwich style; a corn biscuit of sorts. Anything made out of 100% corn will catch my attention - can't consume gluten; it' been so long since I've had a sandwich out at a restaurant!   The bakery has the Arepas Grill attached. The menu board shows all the different fillings you can get in your Arepa. I uploaded pics of the menu. You order at the counter, wait 10-15 minutes and they bring it out to you wrapped in paper. I ordered the Pelua - shredded beef and gouda. It was warm, the arepa was light and crispy and the meat was well seasoned; I inhaled it in minutes. Absolutely delicious.   Other than the arepa's they serve sweet corn pancakes and also a breakfast platter and desserts. The sandwich was more than enough to fill me up, but heartier appetites may want to order dessert; they had the usual South American options of flan, tres leches and a passion fruit mousse.   An option for a vegetable side dish would be nice, but just a minor quibble. I loved what I ordered and will definitely be coming back to try the different sandwichs and also for breakfast.",

One gal got rice and beans and said they were excellent.  Half of us not only ate Arepas at the restaurant, but we also took empanadas home with us.  Several of us got tres leches.  I'm a bit of a purist and didn't care for the whipped cream on top, but the cake was good.  One girl got passion fruit mousse.  It looked a bit small, but she said it was really good. Eunice said you can order ham bread 2 days in advance, so one of my parties I plan to order one to give it a try.  Every once in a while, she makes Hallacas and I was lucky enough to get one to try. She gave me tips on how to reheat it when I got home. I am definitely coming back.  One of these mornings I would like to try their breakfast arepas.",

The best part about the empanada was the hot sauce...It was so delicious that we had to ask for more of it. Otherwise it wasn't that remarkable. It contained chunks of meat which weren't really evenly distributed throughout. This led to some meatless bites.  The arepa was out of this world good. Ours had shredded beef, chorizo, beans, and plenty of avocado. The avocado tasted so fresh and was a great complement to the hot meat and beans. It was a little messy to eat but nothing a few napkins couldn't fix.",

I like the flavor of the arepa and the fillings HOWEVER what MADE this item so tasty was the fresh avocado and the green salsa. Without it, the meal would've been too heavy and not flavorful enough. The one thing I really didn't like were the pieces of pure beef fat in the arepa. There were about three pieces and I picked them out. This may not be a negative for some but it was for me. Regardless, it was easy enough to take out.  In general - it was good (with some modifications) and filling. I would recommend it!",

It reminded me of a chicken salad sandwich, but the bread is corn and it was spicier. When you are here, go with an arepa, that's what makes this place so special. Hubs ordered the daily special (fajita) and was wishing he would have gone with the arepa . The fajita was fine, but you can get that at any Latino restaurant. If you like heat, ask for the green sauce...and if you are even more brave, ask for the spiciest sauce! HOTTTTT!  I'm not sure what to compare it to, price wise. But it was good and filling. You can leave under $10 or splurge and get a jugo natural.  It was a bright and cheerful establishment and very clean. The employee that took my order was friendly.  Like others have said, it will take time to get your order. That's good because it means it's fresh.

Vegetarian and vegan friendly, just let them know when ordering. The spicy sauce is really spicy, so proceed with caution. I'm Latina and it cleared my sinuses. A little pricy for traditional street food ($2.50 for an arepa with nothing) but I'd eat there again.",

The arepas here are much better than at Sabor Latin Street Grill, and they have lots more varieties. Arepas Grill also has other things like cachapas and breakfast plates. Overall, I think this place is almost as good as Arepa Mia in Atlanta. However, I would not get their bandeja paisa again.",

    "text": "We were tired of the same food so decided to try this place out. The food is sssoooo good! We ordered for about 6 of us in the office so ordered chicken and beef empanadas, the chicken arepa, the beef arepa, chicken salad arepa, choripapa and shared it all. Everything was very well seasoned - make sure to ask for the green salsa to go with them that has a little kick to it but not too spicy for those that are sensitive. They also have an orange one but is VERY spicy so be aware.   Only reason it wasn't 5 stars is because they had a little bit of difficulty remembering what we said enough to ring us up. We had to repeat our order a couple times. I had someone who spoke Spanish with me so it helped a lot but they were still a little confused. I think she may have been training, which is why it wasn't too frustrating.   This will definitely be on my return lunch list. They cook everything fresh and pack the arepas so thick you could almost just buy an extra arepa with your order and scoop some out to fill both. Maybe 10 minutes total from ordering to getting your food. There's no way you'll leave hungry, we all need a nap now...",

The owner was a lovely lady who let us sample cheeses and patiently answered all of our questions. She was super helpful, friendly, and happy to share recommendations. She told us she'd been in business over eight years which says a lot for a restaurant.   We ordered and seated ourselves in the place which has a dozen tables or so. It took maybe 10-15 minutes and our food came hot and fresh!  I'm not sure why others complained about the service but we had a great experience.  The food was delicious, full of flavor, and unique!  For someone gluten free like myself, it was such a treat to get to eat a sandwich again!   We ordered the arepa with avocado and another with the shredded beef and Gouda cheese. I don't remember the names but the Gouda cheese one was my favorite. They come out on these crispy hot tasty corn arepas and are fabulous. There were several others we wanted to try so we will be back!   We ordered three arepas for me and my husband and that felt like a perfect amount. Two arepas without any side may not have been enough although four arepas would have been too many.   I would highly recommend this place for an authentic delicious arepa meal with friendly service!!",

It's an order at the counter place that is a bit of a hole in the wall, but this is exactly what I love.  My friend, Virginia, and I shared an order of the plantains.  They were also out of this world.   The menu is limited, but broad enough that I could return several times and never get bored.  There were a variety of natural juices, just like you would find in any Latin country.  I really wanted to try to guava or blackberry, but I resisted, based on the sugar that is in these drinks.   It was so tempting.  I also wanted to try the Tres Leches dessert, but I was good today.  I will come back for this!  Very clean space with a high sanitation score.  It was a fun experience and I am happy to recommend it.  If you have never had Venezuelan food, get to this restaurant.  You will have a lip smacking experience and you will have fun.

Read the reviews here, location was relatively close to my office so I decided to give it a try. Not disappointing at all.  The wait might be longer than I would wish, but it's irrelevant, as I continue to go back for the food. Perhaps if you are in a rush, don't think it's a quick grab-n-go or order ahead of time and pick-it up on your way.  I've had the Reina Pepeada last time and it was delicious. The shredded chicken was fresh and the avocado sauce is amazing. I always ask for the additional spicy green sauce and basically drench the arepa. It's soooooooooo good.  if you want beef, the carne mechada is nothing to miss! If you are in for something sweet, get the fried plantanos. Nicely crispy outside, but soft and sweet.   The intersection can be a little crazy, so keep an eye out both ways.",

They have a couple options for those who don't eat meat which makes it a good spot for anyone. I got the domino which is an arepa stuffed with beans and cheese and it was filling. The service was a bit slow but they didn't have a lot of staff. Ordering take out is easy and saves you time.",

I've had arepas like these before while living in Miami and have to say these are just as good.   The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is the cost. My arepa alone was $9.50. Everything I ordered was almost $16 which is pretty steep for lunch. I don't see myself spending that much on lunch often but will likely be back the next time I want to splurge.",

I had never had them before so I figured what the heck, may as well try em. They had a lot of items on their menus that I would like to try in the future so I will probably be back as this is pretty close to my work.  The empanadas were absolutely delicious,  I cannot believe I missed out for so long. They were freshly made and fried and had a corn meal type crust. 4 hit the spot just right, and the sauce that came with them was amazing as well. I would love to know how they make it. My buddy got some sort of Venezuelan sandwhich that I didn't catch the name but I plan on trying next time and it looked even more tasty than my empanadas.",

I once had them in NYC from a street festival and these are the same delicious treat!! I also got the Reina arepa which had chicken, avocado and mayo like chicken salad, which was a savory mix. There are more varieties but I need to go again. For those who are new to this, arepas are corn based cakes with savory meat inside. The meat options and cheese are my favorites. I like the combination of corn cake and meat and cheese. They also have empanadas and other bakery treats I want to try next time.  The prices are reasonable about $5-8 per arepa. The green sauce is spicy but a perfect addition to the savory. The service was quick, nice people for me as I did lunchtime take-out.",

Ordered two of their arepas (Pelua - Shredded Beef and Gouda and Reina Papiaida - Chicken Salad) and the Cachapa which is a sweet corn pancake folded over with cheese in be middle. They are pretty filling and it's almost like eating a nice fluffy tortilla with filling inside. It's pretty close to authentic as my girlfriend who's Venezuelan told me so we'll definitely be back.

You'll definitely get full as they have lots of snackable options on the menu.   I never heard of an arepa until I ate here but they are delicious. You have to try them if you go. They also bring out some nice dipping sauces that spice up the sandwiches and sides on the table.   The lady working behind the counter was super friendly and helpful to our ignorant American tongues. We'll definitely be back.  Donald Trump is a b*tch!",

    "text": "So, I've never had Arepas. I've had Mexican Gorditas and Salvadorian Pupusas... Arepas seem to be similar to these. Sadly, I'd take a gordita or a pupusa any day of the week over an arepa. Not that there's anything wrong with arepas, they just didn't have the same addictive side-effect their Mexican and Salvadorian counterparts did.  Now, to the actual experience here; mine was fine. Just fine. Nothing bad, nothing good. It was just fine. I did screw up a bit as I only noticed the big boards right above the food prep area thinking it was a very limited selection. Only after ordering did I realize that they had a much larger selection of arepa option on the back wall.  I ended up ordering Reina Pepeada arepa and another one that was just a corn disc with cheese (I can't remember the name. I didn't have to wait very long for either of them, so that was good.   The Reina Pepeada was literally overflowing with the filling, which tasted like a very bland chicken/mayo salad. I didn't get much of the avocado, much less cilantro. It was a massive portion and I didn't finish it. The other one was pretty bad. But I think that's the way it's supposed to be. The corn disc itself was so dry it was hard to eat without liquid. It simply tasted like a very thick dry tortilla with a little bit of white cheese on top.  Overall, it was ok. I didn't' dislike anything, but I didn't really like anything enough to be all like, \"duuuuuude, let's totally go get some arepas!!!\".  My biggest gripe is how extremely overpriced everything seemed. Again, Gorditas and Pupusas seem to have more character, flavor, and deliciousness and they're about 1/4 of the cost of the arepas here. They seem to use the same ingredients, so I do not know why the price discrepancy. The price points for all the products and how bland my food was, are the sole reasons why I will probably not return.",
