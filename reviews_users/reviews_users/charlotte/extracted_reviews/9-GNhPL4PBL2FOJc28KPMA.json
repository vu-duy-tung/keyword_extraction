The tamales were good, but I was expecting them to be head and shoulders above every other tamale I've had, and they weren't.  Of the three kinds I tried, the best was the cheese with quesadillas. I was not able to try the sweet tamales.",

I did not mind that the little boy working in the front was very inexperienced, or half of my orders, they did not have.  I gave it a three because the tacos were good but the salsas was just too salty. Salsa verde is the more spicy one.  The tamales had little fillings and the masa is too thick. This makes it \"dry\" to eat, but when dipped with the salsas, too salty.   Overall it was not worth $35.00.  I will try it one more time to make sure it was not a mistakes with the salty salsas. Plus I would like to try the three dishes they didn't have today.",

We have had mango, watermelon, cantaloupe, and pineapple thus far. One time they had horchata to offer as well. If you haven't seen this place, it's across the street from the Food Lion on The Plaza. It's a small hole-in-the-wall restaurant that's well worth a visit. Be sure to ask for some hot sauce. Mmmmm!!",

The pork, chicken, barbacoa, cheese, and other tamales are all delicious and made to order. They also have tacos, mole, real fruit juices.

It is a hidden gem on The Plaza. Although it appears very small from the outside it does goes further back with several booths and single seats down a countertop. Now, don't expect anything fancy, just a good old school restaurant.  The menu is on the wall above you and as I checked it out they offer an extensive list of items, Tacos, Tostados, Tamales (of course) and several more.  They also have aquas fresca in several different flavors. Having never been I decided to stick to some basics, just to get my bearings down. I ordered two chicken tacos, no cilantro, a carnitas tamale and rice and beans.  Everything is cooked to order and can be tailored as you wish, no cilantro, no problem.   The food arrived piping hot from the kitchen and was so fresh. The tortillas were heated/fried to perfection and the tacos had a great amount of chicken and onions. The tamale was amazing. And, the rice and beans..definitely order the rice. It was cooked perfect and just the right side to go with my meal.  It was hard to not finish them, but I was so full. Tamalas La Pasadita is a definite Taco Joint I will hit again.    A True family owned restaurant with great food and service...",

When we were in the mood for some tacos after a day of drinking, we knew we had to try this place with so many Five-Star ratings! And boy did it ever live up to the other reviews! They offer the usual suspects from tamales, tostados to tacos and have a great fresh variety of types from barbacoa, chicken, tounge, and pork! Everything was incredibly fresh and tasted incredibly authentic! But beware their fruit flavored water is addictive and their jalapeno packs quite a punch  Definitely tons of flavor here and worth the trip!",

SHAME!!)  Hermanos y hermanas, I am here to sing the praises of Tamales de Pasadita. Gone are the urges for an authentic barbacoa or al pastor street taco. No longer will you yearn for your Christmas tamale. Fear not the neighborhood or appearance of the rough this diamond is nestled in. A warm smile and a courteous hello await you just inside, as does the best food this reviewer has had in quite a while.  Much as gracias a mis amigos por la comida fantastica.",

Sure you can go to a Mexican chain restaurant for the hip decor and the mediocre food. I prefer the functional over fashionable and Tamales La Pasadita definitely puts the focus on the food. Exceptionally friendly staff, clean restaurant and very well executed food is the reason why I ate here everyday (14 days) that I was in Charlotte.",

They are currently expanding into the next door space.  my one recommendation is that they switch to paper/plastic menus instead of the not-so-easily-updated marquee menu board they have, it just looks ugly with all the things marked out/taped over/written over.    if you like off the beaten path, small family run joints, this is the spot for you.  or if you just like good tamales, get it to go.",

I'm a big tamale fan, but haven't found a great place for them since I moved from Chicago, so I was willing to give this place a second chance. And, for the record, I actually love the look and decor of Tamales La Pasadita.  My issue is with its food and service.   When I tried to place my takeout order today, the server spent most of his time watching a soap opera playing behind me and got testy when I modified my order.  When we got home to eat the food, the tamales were rubbery and not tasty at all.  Worst of all, in all of our meat orders, (carnitas and pollo), there was bone, which is always unpleasant to come upon.  Just generally terrible food. I loathe being the bearer of bad news, as there is nothing I would want more than to find a delicious hole in the wall spot.  But this place is not it.",

For one, the sauces were good (that's it) and two, everyone is entitled to a bad day. But this must have been a horribly, awfully bad day. We get there at 1:30 in the afternoon (4 adults, 1 kid) place our order and sit down. We all ordered chicken as our protein which, since there are only 4-5 proteins on their menu shouldn't be a problem. 10 minutes later the lady comes up and says they don't have chicken so we exchange it for carnitas (disappointed but no big deal). 5 minutes later she comes back, there's no pork either so they just made our whole order with steak (um...whattt?). We get no choice, the food comes. My tamale I ordered was DRYYYYYYY. I didn't eat it. The steak tacos, even though not at all what we ordered weren't bad but nothing special. Then when we went up to pay (and we did the math) what should have been a 40 dollar bill ran up to 60 dollars. We all added it up and it didn't make sense at all. We were too frustrated to argue and just paid and left. Won't be back.",

I must say I was a little skeptical but at the same time I'm ALWAYS down to try a place once lol, and if I love it... of course I'm reviewing it and then I'll go back hahaha.  Well that has happened for this place! Walking into the restaurant that has the BEST TAMALES in Charlotte I absolutely LOVED how brightly colored the sea foam green. It gave the restaurant so much light and made it feel very refreshing when you walked in. The entire restaurant was SPICK AND SPANE CLEAN! And I take note of everything and this place was spotless! According to the owner his wife likes things to be clean lol.   I LOVE IT!   The bathrooms were small but understandable due to the size of the restaurant. And the hand wash station was outside of the restroom. So that's good, this way you don't have to worry about touching a door knob after washing your hands. SMART!  The entire menu is in Spanish, so if you don't know Spanish, can't read Spanish, or at least know what the basic words mean like {Pollo = Chicken}... You may want to download a translator app. Thankfully I know a little Spanish plus I had my bestie with me lol. I ordered what I could then she went through and made sure I ordered it correctly.   Food Although we went for Tamales I also wanted tacos and I do glad I ordered both! The tacos were sooo delicious ! But the tamales were out of this world! Hot, fresh and filling! Everything was made to order and didn't take long to make. Oh and they had Augas Frescas my FAVORITE!!!! This is the first place in Charlotte that I've located it so if I only go back for a full cup of this, I'll be a happy girl. But I'll be back for it all. For all the food we had, our bill was $14.00.  Tamales: $2.00 ea Augas: $2.75 ea Tacos: $2.00 ea   You can't beat that!",

    "text": "You know what they say. Tamale is another day.  One of the best places to eat in all of Charlotte with some of the most delicious Mole you can imagine.   I would know. I have a Mole on the inside.  Also, absolutely wonderful service and good prices and probably my favourite meal in the whole city that I've had so far - and I've had quite a few good ones. Like The Cure, I come to \"Charlotte Sometimes\", and when I do, I come here.  Really... One of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at in North Carolina. The prices aren't bad and the food is spectacular. The service is as good as the food. The mole is second-to-none and absolutely dreamy, perfect and delicious. The tamales are the excellent kind wrapped in banana leaves, and are amazing as well.  It's a very unheralded little place, so make sure you stop by when you're in North Carolina to try some of the best Mole I've had anywhere in the country.  Eat here quickly. Before the world ends as predicted by Dennis Quaid. Oh wait, that was that movie, The Day After Tamale.  Prices aren't dirt cheap, but then neither is your Dad. Oh wait, he is.  And don't try to kill your Tamale. Because Tamale Never Dies.",

    "text": "I've been trying to find the best tacos in Charlotte and I am still on the search. Got there around 6:30pm. It's pretty hidden. I've been driving down plaza road all the time and never noticed it. It was very dead and quiet, but clean. Parking was a little bit sketchy, but I had no other choice. I ordered one of each of every variety of taco that they had and wanted to try their famous tamales. I ordered their red chicken tamales. Unfortunately the tamales was a let down. The tamales itself and the chicken was dry. Maybe because it wasn't fresh and they probably had to heat it up, but one compliment is that the masa had a very good flavor to it which I enjoyed.   The tacos on the other hand were quite delicious. The meat portion was very generous and the flavor of each one were very delightful. The hot sauces and watered-down sour cream were a nice addition too. For me I like to smother my tacos with sauce, but for this place, you want to be careful because their least spicy sauce is already spicy for me (I'm not a spicy person, but for the average person, it is spicy). I truly enjoyed my taco experience. If it wasn't for the tacos, I would have given this place a 3 and a half star review. One thing I did wish they would have done would be to give me a little more slices of radish to compliment the tacos.  Pros: good meat portion for tacos, flavorful meat, clean inside  Cons: expensive tacos ($2.75 each), dry tamales, sketchy parking   Conclusion: not the best tacos in town",

    "text": "I like this place. It is clean. It is simple. It is straightforward.  Order at the counter. They bring it to you.  Be prepared for a very authentic experience.  This is not your basic Tex Mex restaurant in Charlotte. I had chicken with mole sauce.  It can came with yellow rice and black beans and tortillas.  I think the tortillas were handmade.  I also had a tamale with raisins. So, the mole sauce was not quite as sweet as I like. It was somewhat bitter for my taste, but was still good.  The rice and beans were terrific. The raisin tamale was chewy and not my favorite.  They are known for tamales, so I had to get one.  I was disappointed that they didn't have iced tea.  Remember, it is authentic, so they had fresh fruit drinks: watermelon, cucumber, and papaya. I gave in to the papaya juice. So sweet, but so good.  If you are into clean holes in the walls, authentic Mexican food, and a simple dining experience, go here.  Don't expect any service, besides bringing your food to the table.   They don't ask you how everything is. They don't provide drink refills.  They don't ask you if you need a box for take out of leftovers.   I wish they would have done those things.  If you go here and want to practice your Spanish, this is a great place to pull out your Spanish words!   I am a fan!",

The coconut one would especially be good on nights when you're craving a little something sweet. They have a choice of salsa Verde and salsa roja with crema as well. At $2.00 a pop these are definitely worth the price and a great budget lunch.",

When we arrived for dinner around 8pm on a Saturday night, we were the only ones in the small restaurant. We sat at the counter and chatted with the friendly young man taking our order. He speaks beautiful English by the way, in case anyone was worried about a language barrier.   We ordered a little bit of everything... Tacos (even the lengua!), tamales, rice & beans, a tostada and aguas frescas. Everything was delicious, especially when we added the red hot sauce and sour cream from the squeeze bottles. The real stars were the tamales though! I tasted the chicken, queso & jalapeno (my favorite) and pineapple. The aguas frescas are the perfect way to cool off your mouth from too much hot sauce. I loved the watermelon, Ted enjoyed his pineapple. I swear, I think I could live on tamales and aguas frescas alone...  Happy to have discovered another authentic spot in Charlotte!",

The seating is limited to a handful of booths and maybe a half dozen seating at the counter. How cozy!  Hubs & I packed up the newborn and were on a mission for authentic, fresh tamales. Score! When the plate arrived at our table, we instantly were pleased. The aroma took us back to some of our best vacations. The flavor was savory and the portions were generous.  We had a 3-tamale platter special and 2 street tacos for less than $15! And we were completely full and satisfied. What?!!  The food is made to order. Employees are very courteous.   Wish it were closer to me and I'd become a regular. Guess it's a good excuse to get out of my Charlotte bubble. Go, enjoy, take cash!",

It smells like my great grandmas house and has no music playing... the painful silence allowed me to hear the microwave running in the back constantly. The two women working acted like we were an inconvenience even being there. The tamales were rubbery and steaming from being microwaved, the pozole was also scalding and burnt tasting. The tacos were decent but nothing you can't get elsewhere. Overall very disappointed.",
