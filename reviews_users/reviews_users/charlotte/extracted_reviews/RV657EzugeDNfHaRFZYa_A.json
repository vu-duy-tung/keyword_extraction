And give special thanks to Mai and her brother Cuong for reserving for us space in their separate dining area for the dinner party and providing us with amazing service and excellent food. Our guests had a wonderful time. Almost no one other than us had eaten Vietnamese food before. I lived in southern CA before and ate Vietnamese food there a lot so I know that the food at Ben Thanh was really good when it came out! Good quality, great taste, authentic, great presentation. Because no one knew what or how to order, Cuong knew their menu inside and out and could advise on any questions and recommend which menu #s to order from. It was brilliant to watch. Then we ordered appetizers for the table and they came out very quickly and well presented for the quantity we ordered. Same with the entrees everyone ordered. And drinks. It was a really pleasant evening and positive experience for our guests. And we had a nice time celebrating a milestone birthday.",

I've eaten in once and ordered takeout probably 6 times and for some reason there's always an issue.  I've ordered the same thing every time: 2 orders of pho ga (chicken pho). Pretty straightforward, no special requests, no apps, etc.  Every time when I get there to pick it up, they only have one order prepared. Waiting for the second order to be wrapped up wouldn't be such a big deal if it didn't happen EVERY SINGLE TIME.  Tonight, they finally got the order right (encouraging!) but then I got home, unpacked the food and couldn't have been more let down.  The $21.00 pho dinner consisted of cold broth that had actually separated (greasy fat film on top). The chicken? Well, the chicken was awful. Hard, clumped together & ALSO cold. The bag of stir-in extras was gross too. Old, mushy limes & limp veggies. The one bright spot? The jalapeno was pretty fresh. I gave them 2 stars because they're very nice people who are always polite. I really hope they'll make some efforts to improve on the food. For now, I'm looking for a new pho spot.",

It comes with your choice of rice, noodles, or bread. My pet peeve is people who don't separate chicken when putting it into soup. This way, the chicken all stick together like a blob! Its lazy work! What am I supposed to do? Stick this whole blob in my mouth? This dish was $12 and definitely not worth it. Overpriced. When we were done, our waitress brought us our check. Another waitress decided it was ok for her to take it without saying anything. Never asked us if we want cash back. She walked by twice just looking at us but we didnt leave. 5min later, she laid our check back on the table without a word and walked off. OK, short hair lady, you weren't our waitress so dont act like we owe you. Another thing i hate, people who only know how to pick up the check. This is why they never had business at their old place. Never coming back.",

The food is good and authentic, but the reason why I gave them 3 stars is because I feel like they are overpriced.

When I questioned them they said they made a mistake and brought me back my adjusted bill charging $9.95 for the noodles. Needless to say we will not be ordering those again as I feel like they were trying to take advantage of us. I did order a boba tea as well and asked for not blended and was brought a blended drink.  I decided not to complain, but it also tasted average. Our other food items were pretty good except our pork was very fatty and the eggrolls were overpriced as well as most of the items on the menu.",

Literally my server sat me at a table with the centerpiece fallen over and the salt and pepper shakers knocked over on their side next to it.  Even seeing that she just put the menus on the table and didn't even try to pick it up.  The bench had rice and meat on it from the prior guest which I had to get someone to clean up, she said it must have been from the children in the morning.  It was 6pm so that's sad.  Once you get over that the food was good, my pho was actually really good and wife's lemongrass curry was low on flavor but adding soy and spice brought it up to par.  Food is a 3.5, rest is a 1.",

I got the usual side of rare sliced beef with meatballs and my husband got the pho ga (although it is not listed on their menu) There are only two size options, a medium and a large bowl.   They offer bubble tea and Thai tea as well sake and wine.   I will surely visit back and try their other dishes!!",

My husband had shrimp curry with rice and I tell you, those vietnamese sweet potatoes had me wanting to rub them all over my face because they were so frigging good. We'll be back. You should go.",

This place is definitely someone's grandmothers recipes. The summer rolls were amazing as well, very fresh and not that crunchy stale feel (happens often with summer rolls).  The sauce was my favorite, it was definitely home-made. 10/10 in my book!!",

Deanna had never had Vietnamese food, so this was an adventure for her.  I talked her into having the PHO.  As a first time experience, how could she not have Pho?  It was NOT my first experience with Vietnamese, but the cold rainy day just insisted on PHO for me too.  They offered it in beef, pork, or veggie broth.  We both chose the veggie broth with chicken added. It was plenty of food and it was tasty.   Next time I look forward to trying their lemongrass chicken.  Their menu was expansive and I found a few things that made me salivate!   The atmosphere  was a throwback to the sixties or seventies, and I loved it.  The adequate booth space and roomy dining area were a nice change from the ordinary.   The very quiet space was conducive to both conversation and digestion!  Service was spot on. I will be back and will share the good word about this restaurant.",

Shrimps BBQ'd on a stick on it n the BBQ beef soft n tasty, not dry like most pho places. I'm happy here. It's like finding home 061017:  #26 Pho w/beef round n tendon. Interesting tendon. Was told they received the wrong tendon in shipment. This one looked like a sliced mushroom but the texture was nice n chewy. Never had it b4. Never knew tendon could b different like that. The beef round was tough but that's cuz it's the round. Was told if you want the softer beef that #28 Pho with the brisket is what to order next time. Looking forward!  Now the #40 Bun this time was again very tasty with all the different meats AND a hint of basil which made it special. This bun so far is the best I've ever eaten, really, n I've rated quite a few of them.   I'll be trying other dishes next time. Hope u try this place!!!!! U really will come back again n again. I promise!",

Not even 5 minutes later she comes and pick up the check and insisted my husband to give her money to pay for our food. Mind you we're not even done eating and she was wanting us to pay already. The owner was walking around but didn't even say hi or smile or nothing. I don't feel so welcome here so I won't be back. Certain people don't understand that you run a business here so therefore customer service should be your first priority. You should always make ur customers feel welcome just like how you would make your guest at home feel welcome.",

The children in the ad were covered in nasty skin diseases that I was forced to stare at. Naturally i was appalled by what i saw but no staff member found this the least bit unappealing and kept it playing. My friend's dish contained enormous chunks of connective tissue that were hard as quartz. Even though chunks were soaking in lake water they were still so so so so incredibly hard.

I think it's your preference on whether you like a savory broth or a sweeter broth. This is a sweet broth, and the cinnamon hits you in the face. If you like that, then I guess it's fine. The service is okay. I guess everything is more expensive here because they keep up with the seating area. I feel like here, they're trying to create an ambience as well...which you're paying for.

The temple rolls were good, but the fresh rice noodle dish was horrid. First off, did not see noodles because they were buried under bean sprouts--I love bean sprouts. The noodles were like they were hidden on purpose because they were burnt. The fresh rice noodles dish was disgusting--tasted of nothing but oil. Another person ordered chicken fried rice and said the chicken was good, but that was it. I have read positive reviews, but after \"eating\" there we both will not go back. I tried very hard to eat half of the portion so it was not money wasted, but I couldn't stomach eating much of it and I do not like to complain, so we paid and left. If I would have thought of it, I would've taken a picture to show how burnt the noodles were (blackish on every noodle).",

Chicken Lemon Grass 80.  Shrimp Lemon Grass 81.  Squid Lemon Grass  * How to Order Lemon Grass Curry : Pick the Number of the corresponding Meat of your Choice, then LISTEN to me... Order withOUT Onions, withOUT Lettuce AND withOUT Sprouts  (I LOVE Onion though in this Dish it is a considerable Improvement to OMIT the onion and Lettuce)!!!  Omitting Sprouts helps to keep the Temperature at a more favorable temperature!  My Favorite Lemon Grass Curry dish is the Beef, Chicken was almost as good, Shrimp was a close Third and the Squid was Good though the Beef and Chicken were Very VERY Good  How to EAT Lemon Grass Curry ALONE Unlike Revenge this is a Dish best Served Hot!  No time for Socialization...Pray on your way to the Table or just after ordering, turn OFF the Phone... Get to the Establishment (as Carson would say) at a less busy time (if possible). Review Ordering instructions from above... Then be prepared to ENJOY  Meat Ball If I could Marry a Food... I Never liked Meatballs until I tasted this Ground Pork with about Eight Cloves of Garlic per pound of Pork a few Spices, put on a skewer, flattened on Cooked YUM!

Located in Windsor Square in a hard-to-see spot across from the Sam's club, you can see the main anchor stores of JC Penny, Office Depot, and HHGregg (now closed) off of Independence, but Ben Thanh is neighbors with the Firehouse subs and Cici's Pizza.  The restaurant also has a small private room for large group dinners and parties if needed.  There's also some unique seating along the left side of the restaurant if you want a full experience (booths that box you in).    The menu is a little daunting, but still navigable.

Every time I received my pho the broth and the vegetables are great, however the Bean sprouts is always bad. About 2 times they gave me a brown looking bean sprouts, which is still edible but not perfect quality and about 5-7 when I visit there the bean sprouts was just bad, stinky, and mushy looking sprouts and that's makes me mad! I guess if you like pho and bean sprouts then don't go there but when you don't need the bean sprouts then I guess you can go there.  The service there is so so, the women there has quite attitude, the man is really friendly.",

    "text": "As I mentioned on a tip: Outstanding menu.  They cover the waterfront of Vietnamese and other SE Asian dishes.  Multiple options in each category and additional options as to meat or no meat and what kind.  Very clean restaurant and the wait staff is very helpful with suggestions.   Beer, saki and wine are served.  Parking is in the strip mall lot.  No problem.  Vegetarian options exist.  I had the Hu Tieu Xao Uot which is a wet noodle with vegetables, choice of meat (I did shrimp) and a brown gravy.  Did not care for it, mostly as the gravy was thick and gooey.  I actually had the thought that they must have a big budget line item for corn starch or another thickener.  The gravy ruined the dish.  It was just gummy.  Will be meeting with another Yelper later so will get his suggestions.  Will most likely stick with rice dishes and some other noodles.  Good service.  Will come back.  Was a very popular spot for lunch and there is plenty of room for diners and groups.",

The worst part of this place is the service. The service is horrible! You're not greeted when you enter. Someone just looks at you with their brows raised as if to say (but doesn't say) \"how many?\"  From there you're seated, water is brought out and your order is taken. You don't see anyone again until the food comes out. After it's served, everyone is MIA again. No water refills, no checking up on you, nothing. When you're done, just walk up to the register and pay. That's it. I don't expect grand gestures but the service here is bare minimum. Ask for recommendations? You get a blank stare and told \"I don't know what you like so I don't know\" um ok.   There's way too many other Vietnamese restaurants around who like my patronage. I'll stick to them instead.",

They have a gorgeous aquarium at the entrance and a nice but not as good one in one of the other seating areas.  To start we got the fried quail which was delicious, it had some seasoning on it, slightly sweet but so good! We had the pho, of course, it was 29#. The broth was slightly sweet but it was delicious. Added some of their extra hot sauce to it!  We also had the chicken lemon grass curry and asked for it spicy. It didn't come out spicy but tasted great. Also got the grilled beef skewers with rice. This was a bit sweet but the beef was really tender!  The menu is huge and I can't wait to try more stuff!",

Shrimps BBQ'd on a stick on it n the BBQ beef soft n tasty, not dry like most pho places. I'm happy here. It's like finding home 061017:  #26 Pho w/beef round n tendon. Interesting tendon. Was told they received the wrong tendon in shipment. This one looked like a sliced mushroom but the texture was nice n chewy. Never had it b4. Never knew tendon could b different like that. The beef round was tough but that's cuz it's the round. Was told if you want the softer beef that #28 Pho with the brisket is what to order next time. Looking forward!  Now the #40 Bun this time was again very tasty with all the different meats AND a hint of basil which made it special. This bun so far is the best I've ever eaten, really, n I've rated quite a few of them.   I'll be trying other dishes next time. Hope u try this place!!!!! U really will come back again n again. I promise!  021719 Sunday Near Costco so we're late brunching it here. Service is bad td cuz it's loaded w/customers. No water served slowly, just the basil-sprout-cilantro-lime dish for pho n the nam pls sauce for the bun bowl.   Good to hear n see Vietnamese families eating here. Go where it's authentic...YUM!  So #40 and #41 bun reads similar but #40 is straight pork meat while #41 is pork balls.",

A pout I've never seen before made me feel guilty for taking it. I had a vegetable/shrimp roll wrapped in rice paper with a side of peanut sauce . . . very good. Our vermicelli dishes were wonderful accompanied with a sweet and sour sauce that complimented the dish not overpowering it.

I would give their Pho a 4 star rating overall. The broth had a good taste, but for my preferences a little too sweet. The two issues I had with the pho was that it wasn't very hot, so much that when I added in my rare steak on the side into the soup, it barely cooked it even after 10 minutes. I love Pho for the fresh steaming hot bowl of goodness, so that was a little disappointing. Also the steak was not the thinnest cut compared to other Pho restaurants. (not even close to being as good as Doans) I like my steak to be really thin like they cut it at the asian stores, because when I ate the steak it was a little hard to chew through.  The reason why I am giving this a 3 star is mainly because of a little mediocre service. Im not sure if this is because we went at 2pm, which i assume is right after their lunch rush, but our waiter only came to our table to take our order and never again, even after when we finished and my boyfriend had to actually get up and find him to place an order of jackfruit smoothie. I also tried to flag down another female waitress from across the room to ask for hot chili oil, but when she saw me she kind of just ignored me. We aren't picky people, so I just got up and got the chili oil from a table myself.  I would possible come try Ben Thanh again, maybe they had an off day. But even judging off just the Pho alone I can name a a couple places who's Pho I prefer more. Our absolute favorite being Doans on South Boulevard.",

I rotate between the vegetarian yellow pancake and the tofu with garlic sauce. Both are so good and loaded with good vegs and fresh herbs. I also love the summer rolls, with tofu or shrimp, and again, lots of herbs and freshness! I tried the avocado shake last time and it was excellent. Would give more stars if we could do so!

The broth is always great, wish it was hotter since the raw steak did not cook well, it was medium rare still after 10-15m in the soup. I had to throw it out, yuck. Lots of noodles in the broth with beef tendon & shank, 2 meat balls & thin steaks. Um not enough meat but lots of noodles. This made the pho plain I guess they are servicing different people here in Matthews since I realize there was no pork or tripe in the soup... hmmm. For the pho only 3 .
