I came here about a month and a half ago and the woman serving was wiping her nose with her wrist (gloved hand, but at that point what difference does it make?) I stopped going to this one for a while because that seriously turned me off. I came back 2 days ago, seriously craving a \"Chipotle burrito.\" My boyfriend found a hair in his food! NASTY!! That should have been the final warning for me. They handled it like any restaurant with poor customer service would, got him a new one. No refund, no free chips and guac, nothing to accommodate for that at all. Ok, so of course I'm craving Chipotle again today and as my bowl is being assembled the server decided to turn around and tap her buddy on the back with her, AGAIN, gloved hand and then once she got his attention, grabbed at the cheese and lettuce with the same hand!!!! I've had it with this place! I got home and threw the bowl out (I know silly of me to pay for it.) But I planned to call their corporate and let them know how unhygienic this place. To bad this is a franchise so I'm out of my $8. Seriously train and manage these people on how to better handle people's food because this place is gross!!!",

They are a little on the pricey side given that the meal does not include any chips and salsa.

We asked the server if the food was cooked spicy, she assured us it wasn't - that the only spicy item would be the salsas or the barbacoa, but the chicken was not spicy. However, my wife couldn't eat her burrito, as it was far too spicy. I tasted it, and there was a decent zing to it.  Other than that, the food was fresh and well-cooked. They had just swapped out the black beans and white rice when we walked in with a fresh batch, so those items were very good. The barbacoa had good flavor, although the cook was a bit heavy-handed with the spicy seasonings. That seems to be a trend here.  The guacamole was decent. For almost $2 extra to put a dollop of guacamole, it needs to be much better than it was for me to buy it again.  All in all, Chipotle doesn't stand out for me among Moe's, Qdoba, or Salsarita's. It's nice that the food is all organic, but it doesn't matter when it's killed with spice.",

The dining area is consistently a mess, and there is typically a line that takes forever to get through. Tonight the line was to the door and there was one person actually sitting to eat. The manager kept looking at the line from the back but didn't offer up any assistance to the crew, instead she walked around with a clipboard distracting the people trying to serve the food. Then when I got the food, the chicken was burnt as were the fajita vegetables, but thankfully I didn't get the pintos that looked like they could be used for wallpaper paste. Also, there was food all over the place on the serving line and behind the counter. Not sure how they got that 99 rating from the health department. Guess I will go to the one near 51 and Johnston next time.",

    "text": "Chipotle is a your average step-up-above-fast food Mexican-inspired restaurant.  Think of Qdoba, Moe's, or Salsaritas.  I heard the rave reviews from friends about this chain so I discovered it for myself.  The restaurant was clean (it was brand spanking new at the time) when I visited and the ingredients were fresh.  However, I was dismayed by the lack of options.  The streamlined menu (maybe some people like this) was basically tacos, burritos, or a taco salad.  Nothing particularly original and though the food was good, I wouldn't make a special trip to visit this place again.  This is not to say I wouldn't return, but they are no unique dishes/ingredients that distinguishes it from the aforementioned chains.    Important note-Chipotle is Cali-Mex, rather than Tex-Mex like the other chains.  Therefore, they have leaner sides; less cheeses and sauces and more fresh veggies.  So, if you're like me and prefer heartier Tex-Mex taste, then Qdoba's, Moe's, or Salsarita's would be a better bet.  If you want a leaner Mexican-inspired meal (but still substantial), you might like Chipotle.",

Staff is usually wonderful (I have had the occasional experience with a less-than-fabulous staff member - but, I figure, we are all human).  The food is delicious and made right in front of you.  I read previous reviews and in my experience, when any one item is on the verge of running out, the server is quick to request more from the kitchen staff (who have always been busy at their station).  I've never had to wait for more than a few seconds for any item to be replenished.  The addition of a kid's menu to Chipotle is the best idea since sliced bread. My kids, who would never dream of eating beans of any type, readily eat them when ordering the \"taco kit\" - it's 2 tortillas (soft or crunchy) + ANY 3 items... we usually get pinto beans, cheese and their AWESOME guacamole + drink + tiny bag of chips.  Kids are happy, parents are happy.. WIN WIN!  This location has offered margaritas for awhile now on their menu but in reality is still waiting for liquor license to be processed.  So they are not actually available yet.  The indoor and outdoor dining areas as well as the restrooms have always been clean.  Highest rating for Chipotle on every point!",

I went in for a late lunch on a Saturday at the end of Feb and I immediately noticed that they were severely understaffed. As the line moved up to my position, I began to hear the employee say they were running out of chicken (and some other meat). When it was my turn, I had taken the last portion of chicken and the next person was told that the next batch of chicken WAS STILL COOKING and there would be at least a 10-20 minute wait.  As for the rest of the toppings, they all seemed to be running low and it was all very messy. I could only see two girls in the back and they were in no rush to re-fill anything nor clean up.   It didn't appear to me that this location was run by anyone in management. If so, they all clearly have given up and not trying to make any improvements. I will not be going back to this location until there's a massive revamp in operation and management.",

This location is the worst... it's quality of service has gone down hill over the past couple of years that I've frequent it. Which is very disappointing!  Tonight I went to get something to eat with my two daughters. We ordered a salad and other items from the menu.... once again quality of food good... but when we went to get our drinks and utensils, no forks.... ok so they haven't restocked the supplies.... it happens so we ask at the counter for forks.... \"we have no forks\" the person replied. What??? Really you sell salad but don't have anything but a spoon to eat it???  You don't mention it to us when we order that maybe we should get a burrito instead of a salad??? About 15 minutes later lo and behold someone comes out with a huge box of forks!!!! The place was empty when we went and was just staring to get busy.   How completely inconsiderate and uncaring for their clientele!!!  I repeat I love the brand but Chipotle really needs to up their employees especially at this location.",

I am a Chipotle enthusiast, and can pride myself on my understanding of Chipotle's attention to quality and overall consistency and this particular location fell short. Despite many reviews eluding to this, I failed to drive the extra 3 miles to a location with better reviews. Lesson learned.  My tomato (Mild) salsa was more of a mush, Carnitas were dry and overly salted, and portion size was sparse. My bowl was literally half empty, and I got the stink eye when I asked for \"a little more rice\". I was also charged for double meat when the portion wasn't even that of a normal bowl at any other location! I was very disappointed.  To top it off they had no lemons or smoked Tabasco, and were unapologetic when I asked about it.  I'm not sure if this is a result of poor management, lack of training, or tight margins at this location, but my meal as a whole was very underwhelming, and that has meaning coming from someone who drives an hour each way just to pick up Chipotle.",

Every other chipotle very helpful and understanding. One night I came ordered my usual but they refused to give me my rice in a another bowl.

Should I have asked for more rice??  Probably, but I didn't. Move on to the meat.  I got steak.  The steak had been there for a while the container was almost empty and the steak looked dry.  The server look back as to ask for the cook to cook more steak but she didn't.  She put what was left of the steak on my burrito.  It was less than the usual amount. Should I have asked for more steak??  Probably, but I didn't what to pay extra for what was turning out to be the worst burrito I have ever had.   I got a few other things on the burrito and they seemed ok.  Move onto the lettuce.  It was soggy appeared days old and looked so bad I had to pass on it. When the burrito was wrapped up it looked like a hot dog bun in foil.  It was so lacking and small that the cashier had to ask the maker what is was, because she did not initially think it was a burrito.

The fare at Chipotle is generally good, and on that front there are no surprises at this location. The main issue is the parking. This section of the shopping center suffers from what many places in Charlotte do - the developers decide \"hey, there is some land\" and stick some more shops in.  This both clogs the flow of traffic and can make it a challenge to get in and out of the shops in that area. This isn't necessarily the fault of Chipotle, but it does make it a bit of a challenge, so is something to keep in mind if you're in a rush - along with the other hundred or so people rushing to get their burrito bowl at lunchtime.",

Go to the one in Monroe, or the one downtown where they know how to season food appropriately...  Long wait times too, and staff was very flustered and unable to keep meats/queso/fajitas/guacamole stocked. They were fighting amongst themselves too to air their frustrations.  Won't be going here again.",

    "text": "The only reason I give this place one star is because I have to. I have made three different trips there, and it consistently has the worse service and product selection. This last visit was at 8:45 at night. I began placing my order and got all the way to the veggies to find out they were out of lettuce. Well actually they had lettuce, they just weren't prepping any more for the night. They were also out of white rice. They don't close until 10.00, and had plenty of workers standing around talking. Customers were coming in, looking at the options, and leaving. What we wanted was sofritas and chicken, which they had plenty of. I have two major complaints about this location. First, they are always out of something. Second, the young African American woman who runs the register has the most dry, rude, and condescending way of speaking to customers. It's so annoying that she is ALWAYS on register, so you have to interact with her. This is coming from a public school Freshman teacher of 15 years.  The young lady is quick to says she's been there for X years, but she doesn't embody the welcoming attitude of someone vested in Chipotle. On a previous visit, I had ordered five burritos; I asked her which burritos were which, since one was for my son who has special dietary restrictions. Her response was, \"How would I know?\", \"They are numbered by how YOU put the order in.\" I was so put off by her attitude. I calmly explained to her that all other Chipotles have labeled them according to ingredients like \"S\" for steak or \"v\" for vegan, which makes it easier for a customer like me who orders multiple burritos. I have a family of five, and I am very familiar with the routine of differentiating the burritos. I talked with the cashier before I wrote this review, I explained I do reviews quite often, and I really have been trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but they just don't seem to be able to get it together. I travel a lot for work and I frequently stop at Chipotle because of the quality. This particular location is just awful and the cashier is unreasonable. She clearly believes her seniority gives her a pass to be nonchalant and or indifferent towards good customer service and the values of integrity's that Chipotle\" has in their mission statement.",

It's a Tuesday night and the time was unbelievably long to me.  Everyone seemed to be okay with the wait plus it was teacher appreciation night (I had heard).  The rice, meat, and lettuce was steadily being replenished.  Side condiments were given without a charge.  I just don't care for this food.  It's affordable and it's a hearty serving but I don't think it taste better than Sabor (order everything) or Moe's (I get burritos).",

The guacamole was obviously old, I didn't realize that was even what it was till they went to scoop the brown goop. Chips were stale and most ingredients were empty.  All suggested that the employees were ready to get out of the building. The bad guac pretty much ruined the meal and we couldn't eat it or the food it was put on. Unappealing to look at, and had to give up on the meal.  This has not been the norm at all with this location, so I don't know what was going on. However management needs to watch over the closing process. After the experience, I'm selling my shares of chipotle and probably hitting up Moe's.",

I also find is funny that you ran out of salad and filled on the bottom of half of what she gave the older couple in front of me, while you yelled for me, I had to ask for more lettuce because she didn't fill it up. Yall gave the older couple a nice amount of chicken. I literally threw away half of my salad because you gave me half a freaking spoon full. I will never come back here again for a 7 dollar sandwich when I can go up the road and get a buffet for 8 dollars with fresh fruits and veggies with salad. VERY disappointed.  Update: the hispanic lady whose there on week day openings is the best! Good portions, great smile, friendly! Food portion has increased with price increase.",

    "text": "Let me just start this off with a statement. Chipotle is the holy grail of restaurants. It is my favorite place on earth and I want to conceive my children here someday so that chipotle will always be a part of them. However, this chipotle is very on and off. Whenever I walk in, my mood either drops or goes sky high depending on who I see serving the rice, beans, and chicken. I have been here so many times that I know the exact portions I will be given based on who is serving it. Sadly, I have had to leave and take myself and my wallet elsewhere when I have seen a certain worker. Today was one of those days, but I was with some friends so I decided to stay. The man served my friend and I one weenie scoop of white rice and far more beans, creating an undesirable mixture. He then gave me quite small portions of chicken and steak, which does not allow my taste buds to be purely satisfied come feasting time. Luckily, the good lady was up next, so my portions of guac, corn, cheese, and mild salsa were all above my expectations. Chipotle, I love you, but please be more consistent and let me know how great my portions are gonna be every time I walk in.",

    "text": "Not sure what's going on with this Chipotle location. I am a regular here for lunch and the last few times I've been here there were a few issues. They have been out of items such as fajita vegetables and chopped lettuce, which I end up waiting for while they refill, on my lunch break. The people assembling the food also seem to be stressed and in a rush yet operating more slowly than usual. I used to be in and out with my to go order in less than 5 minutes, but not lately.  This is happening when they aren't even that busy. What prompted me to write this review today, though is the rude service I received from one of the employees. I've never encountered this at any Chipotle and a large majority of the people here are quite nice, personable and hard-working. However, one young lady assembling food today gave me a very blunt and interrupting \"I can't hear you\" when I asked for my toppings. Granted, it's loud in there but she could've responded with a polite, \"Could you repeat that?\" or \"What was that?\"   Ugh! I have no tolerance for rude service. I've been in the food industry and I would never treat a customer like that.   I was not surprised to see other similar reviews when I came to write this one today. Hopefully management will read these and get this place back to normal. If not I will probably get my Chipotle fix at another location on my way home from work.   Update: So, I've been back recently and they seem to have all new staff and management at this location. Big improvements in speed and friendliness of service!!",
