    "text": "The other night we visited Killington's in Baxter Village for the first time and we can't wait to go back.  This place advertises itself as a gastro pub with high quality food and that description fits this place perfectly.  We started off with the Portabella Napoleon which was absolutely amazing. A layered treat of portabella mushroom topped with red peppers, goat cheese and zucchini literally had our mouths buzzing with flavor. Dinner for us consisted of the Baxter chicken entree as well as the Salmon PLT sandwich. The chicken was tender and juicy covered in mozzarella and roasted red pepper over mashed potatoes The salmon sandwich was equally delicious and even the bread was amazing, as it was toasted and had some type of mustard sauce layered underneath it. Even the sauteed spinach on the side was fabulous. Top this off with great service and a nice craft beer selection and that makes for one very nice dining experience.  Simply a top shelf restaurant at a great price point!",

You know it's prepared properly when leftovers the next day are still great! We will be back!",

I approached the manager and he was very kind and accommodating. Cooked new fries, brought them out, and decided the seasoning wasn't to HIS liking. Took them back, perfected them, and we were happy in the end.  Food is great. NEEDS A HAPPY HOUR!   UPDATE: Went back for the fourth time and the fries were still cold and soggy. Now the good experience is the exception, and we will give them a few months to get things straight instead of the once per week visits we were making.",

The restaurant is still working out some kinks in their operations. When we were there, they had 2 cooks call out so the kitchen was slow. They provided free apps and reduced our bill due to the wait which was extremely generous. They'll get there and this place will easily be one of our favorite local dinner places.",

We are a younger family and often times it's difficult to find a place that accommodates our needs/wants without sacrificing something, that is definitely not the case here! We've been countless times and continue to be impressed, we also appreciate that when they are busy we've been given the heads up that we can be seated and grab apps and drinks but food may be a little delayed. Again, this is awesome for us and wish more places were upfront. We've found our go to and it never disappoints, it's so nice to have a family owned/local spot that supports the community as well. We've also had the owners stop off at our table on numerous occasions. I just cannot say enough about this place!",

We used to go all the time when it was Beef o Brady, but have yet to be to this restaurant yet, and now never will. Both times we had 7 people. They said we had to wait for a booth... the 2 they had had 3 people and 2 people sitting in them while they had open 4 person booths and tables. They offered a high top table, but had an 18 month old kid. NEVER AGAIN!",

Went last light with my husband and while the service was still very good, the quality of the food was lacking. My husband got the Cuban with creamed spinach. The creamed spinach was good, however the Cuban was below average. I got a French Dip & asparagus. The roast beef was tough and dry, the provolone cheese was already waxy by the time it reached my table- an indication that It had been made a while before served. Part of the roll was burned.  Both side portions were very small.  I hope our experience was an anomaly, but judging by the sparse crowd for a Saturday night, I have to wonder. We might give this place a try in the future, but I'll be watching YELP for some positive reviews before we chance it.",

    "text": "**Updated review to reflect more recent visits: I've been back at least 4 times - usually after the rush but every time (except 1 brunch) the food has taken so long that it's tarnished our view of the place. One visit we waited about an hour after ordering and came to find out our food hadn't even gone in yet - I will not blame the kitchen because they do get backed up but I will put blame on the management because when your kitchen is backed up that much you need to empower your wait staff to do whatever they can to keep those waiting content - whether it be a complimentary salad or appetizer. Another visit we had been there a while (again, very long wait for food) and we just wanted to get out of there and our waitress was nowhere to be found and we needed change. So I asked another waitress if she could break a $20 and instead of taking the time to help out her team, she declined to help and instead pointed me to the bar to do it myself. That's not how you build a loyal customer base. I haven't been back since and will probably be a while before I go back. Still one of the best burgers in the area though.**  I ordered the gastro pub burger with mashed potatoes and an extra side of grits. No lie, this burger almost brought tears to my eyes it was so good. Tender, juicy and very creative - some sort of cheesy sauce vs slice of cheese and the bacon w pickles is a dream. Easily top 3 burgers, maybe best I've ever had. The mashed potatoes were dry and not creamy which because of the burgers I gave them a pass, I wouldn't get them again though. Not amazing. The grits - I hate grits but my wife wanted them - super gooooood.   She had a black bean burger - she's a veggie & fish eater. I think she's over black bean patties because they're overall crumbly and dry, and it's not like you're eating a veggie burger, you're still very much eating beans. So she prefers a veggie patty.   Well because of my burger euphoria we are definitely going back and there were a few things she was looking forward to trying some other things. Oh! Super nice servers and staff, very great people. Pretty chill ambiance - nothing to write home about. Wish they took reservations. They're always packed (which good for them :D)",

Excellent. We ordered the pretzel but they didn't want to bring us the original one they had made because it broke. Our manager said it was all about the presentation. So we received a gorgeous pretzel with very yummy pimento cheese spread and hot mustard. My husband got the Baxter chicken which was absolutely amazing and then I ordered the cast iron beef tenderloin. I asked for a medium cook but when  I received it it was closer to well done. normally I would send this back but it had a very good flavor. Within a few minutes the manager came out with a brand new meal for me and said he thought that it looked over cooked.  They replaced my meal even though I did not complain. I've been incredibly impressed with the fantastic service. The attention to detail. And the willingness to make something right even when customers don't acknowledge. We will be back.",

    "text": "Hands down the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  Started with a 30 minute wait.  No big deal, it's a Friday night.  They take your phone number and promise to call when it's your time.  Lies.  We went next door for a pre-dinner drink and after waiting about 30 minutes I decide to check in on the wait.  They're a bakers dozen amount of parties ahead of us.  Never called.  After a panicked scramble to get our party of 3 a table we end up \"downstairs\" where everyone is served by a quasi-bartender who has way too much going on.  Supposedly we're going to get a free appetizer but I'm not optimistic.  Takes some time before we can even get a drink order in.  Get the kid milk - she delivers one of those grade school 8oz cartons from 1989.  Did we order a happy meal?  Order food, get asked how I want my pork chop cooked.  Uhh, without trichinosis please. If it's delivered.  20 minutes later still waiting on that \"free\" appetizer.  While we wait we watch the party of 7 adjacent to us get each dinner served individually spaced 2-3 minutes apart.  It would be entertaining if it wasn't so sad on a basic how to operate a restaurant level.   So at about the 30 minute or so mark (an hour and a half after first arriving) we get our appetizer, sans plates - who need plates.  Those need another 5 minutes to prep.  Once that's in order we have the pleasure of cutting into some stuffed banana peppers that have clearly been under a heat lamp since about 4 minutes after we ordered them.  And,to be expected at this point, prior to finishing the appetizer the meal arrives (in stages - they bring the kid's dinner last - excellent thinking).  Her chicken is described as \"chewy\" ... his pork chop is thankfully cooked through but lacking flavor.  The kid gave a negative head shake when asked if his pasta was good. Yikes.  And at the end they tried to charge us for that free appetizer.  Needless to say, never ever shall we return.",

I opted for \"sad\" asparagus (see photo). She also ordered the tomato bisque. Also rated as okay by her. She did love the grapefruit Flirtini. I ordered a hefeweizen which after a sip I knew was an IPA. I told the individual that brought our meals that I had ordered a hefeweizen and this was not one. She said she would tell our waitress. Then I am told they ran out of the hefeweizen. Then seeing that 2 sandwiches, a cup of soup and 1 cocktail were over $35 without tip I think this place will not be seeing me again.

The hostess tends to be inexperienced with crowds and big parties. There is no other menu but dinner. Good luck finding something small for lunch.   For the area it's good.",

We loved all of our appetizers from the stuffed peppers to the fried raviolis... The kids loved that there were two different menus to choose from, Junior and kids menus... I had the Baxter chicken which was absolutely amazing! We very rarely order dessert out but for some reason we did last night and it was exceptional! We ordered the blueberry cheesecake, peanut butter pie and a brownie sundae... There were 11 of us by the way! Everything was fantastic can't wait to go back :)",

Staff, wait times and everything else non-food related (except the crap music) was great. The food I hate to say was just average. The calamari soaked in some Asian sauce was fair but not expected. And only rings with thick breading and no octopus tentacle-looking parts was unexpected. I shoulda read the description - that's on me. Still, not very good. Mrs and I ordered burgers. Medium usually means some pink - ours were thoroughly overcooked. And the buns were McDonalds grade. My son got the ribs and besides hardly any sauce, they had no flavor. On the plus side, the fries were good.   Maybe this is just them finding their groove and things will improve. Suggestions: ditch the awful 80's Pandora station. Cook meat to temp ordered. Find a new bun vendor. Ditch the macrobrews served at Applebee's and find some more local stuff. And throw in a few appetizers under $10 because none exist.",

What used to be a private dining/karaoke room now appears to be general seating, so it's a good size, and it took awhile for them to be on a wait on a Wednesday evening. There are also two different bars with seating.  Service was pretty darn great - our waitress was spot on (until she disappeared while we waited for our check), and two different managers came over to check in on us.  We started with the duck spring rolls, which were tasty, especially the sauce. For dinner, the fella got the pub fish fry, and I got the Baxter chicken. Both were solid! We're also pretty excited that they're open for brunch on Sundays. The menu for brunch and dinner appear to be the exact same as the Huntersville location. The fella was a little underwhelmed with their beer choices (he's a craft beer nerd), but he found a couple of things, and my wine was delicious.  Overall, this seems like a great addition to Baxter - salads, sandwiches, and entrees in the $9 - $20 range and more elevated than your standard bar fare. Six Pence had better look out!",

The fried onions I love, but don't really help here. The jicama slaw is flawless and the pickles were very tasty and added a nice crunch and acidity. I love that the duck was smoked here, but I thought it might still have that ducky goodness, but here it was like a really tender chicken. Overall it was tasty!

    "text": "Killington's has been open in Fort Mill for about a year. Tonight was our first time dining there and our experience was great. We had a party of six, including a baby, and every member of the staff was just amazing in a genuinely friendly and not \"pushy\" or \"fake\" manner. This was even despite the fact that they were pretty busy with some large parties when we arrived.  The space took over the old Beef O'Brady's location and the decor is more contemporary with dark wood accents and a nicer bar. There are elements of Western New York on the walls since the owners are from there but it is not overkill (thankfully I didn't notice any Bills or Sabres logos). Likewise, the menu has some aspects of Western NY without overdoing it. They have stuffed banana peppers, steak in the grass, fish fry, and of course, wings.  However, there are a lot of other options that range from $10 sandwiches to entrees that are closer to $30 and everything in between.  Three people in our party got the steak in the grass which is an open-faced 6 ounce sandwich with spinach and mozzarella. One got a grilled shrimp salad and I had a pub roast beef sandwich. Most of our orders were slightly customized to due to food sensitivities and everything came out 100 percent as ordered. My french dip was good but the chef's vegetables consisting of broccoli, carrots, and green beans were amazing. They were seasoned with a little bit of garlic and some other seasoning I couldn't place. I would definitely order those again and again.  The food was good and much better than most of the sub-par bar food that Beefs offered. The service really put this over the top though so we look forward to returning as long as they remain consistent.",

We were greeted and told we could sit wherever we'd like. We sat in a booth.   The menu has a variety of items from salads to sandwiches, burgers to entrees. I ordered the special which was the prime rib with parmesan green beans and a side salad. Hubby ordered a meatloaf sandwich. The side salad was pretty good. I got the sweet and spicy dressing which was okay. The entree was a good size. The most flavor on the plate were the parmesan green beans. The prime rib was chewy and lacking seasoning. I poured the au jus and some of the horseradish sauce and it was still just okay for me.  Even though it was slow, there was a group of really loud people on the other side of us, but I guess that comes with the later dinner. We just wanted a quiet dinner.  There's a good variety on the menu and I wouldn't mind coming back to try something different.",

From the location in the gorgeous Baxter Town Center to the amazing food, this place is one of my favorites for an afternoon date on Sunday with my husband. The mushroom ravioli is like nothing I've ever had before. The only thing keeping me from giving it a five-star rating is the service. While the waitresses do have great personalities, they don't really check back on us between our orders being placed and then served. We needed drink refills something fierce (and even after our food arrived, it still took a little more time for our drinks to get replenished). But, from what I saw, they were also setting up for dinner hours and trying to clean certain spots in the restaurant, so this is pretty forgivable. Overall, I am looking forward to the next visit!",

Mostly a bar, and the early afternoon crowd had a very loud guy dominating, which took away from what otherwise is a cozy, more tranquil place.  This became a proven observation after this guy left.  I did think the wine was a bit over priced at $7.50 - 9.50 per glass; but I did like how they had featured whites and reds, both selections were very good ones.  There was a cheaper house wine, Salmon (?) for $5.50/glass if you are on a budget.    Beer seemed high, but I do not remember how much it was. That said, they have a number of drafts, which are regularly changed, and lots of bottled beers.  I especially liked that they featured local beers.  We ate a snack of loaded chips ($8.75) and that was it.  The dinner menu looked like a heck of a lot more to offer than the daytime, so there is potential to check out Killingtons for dinner sometime.",

    "text": "Fort Mill is welcoming more and more casual eateries. It's both wonderful and frustrating but only frustrating because I loved being able to say I live in a small town. Now, everyone knows Fort Mill.  Killington's is a newer spot that is located in what used to be, Beef O'Bradys. Frankly, they deserve a good review for replacing that joint and calling it a \"joint\" is really too polite; but I digress. With a menu of 'standouts', Killington's will be welcoming more and more guests as the seasons change and Baxter Village events pick up. Not too many places offer Pasta Purses or Mahi Caeser Wraps. Don't get me wrong, a twist on classics but still added flare.  The layout of the booths and tables is a bit odd but the added space to walk is nice. It's tough to find a restaurant that you don't feel cramped walking to the restroom, these days. Some places take Fire Department capacity limits to a whole new level... My boyfriend and I visited on a whim. So, I didn't have much time to flip through reviews prior to our visit. Doesn't mean I base all of my selections on a good or bad review, but I do like to have an idea of what my colleagues like or dislike. The tables were mostly full but there were a few open areas so we were seated immediately. They seemed well staffed and attentive to guest needs. I must admit, one thing truly bothered me. Our waitress left her name on a paper name plate. While I appreciate the reminder, as I'm not excellent with the first introduction, the concept is too, too much like Hooters. Something I'd suggest Killington's removes from their policies. Though it may just be my preference, my boyfriend acknowledged the oddity as well.  Otherwise, we had a pleasant experience. I'd score a 90 for cleanliness of the guest accessible areas (restroom included), 92 for service and 100 for the food. I did quite enjoy the pasta purses. My boyfriend devoured his Bayou Pasta and the bite I stole from his plate was worth his glare! We will definitely be back.",

Prices are too high for the food type and quality.  Maybe they believe the Baxter young family crowd will bring their younger children and pay high prices ?       In summary.  Not bad food.  We had a couple of different salads.  Chili and a homemade chip cheese thingy.",

    "text": "I've been to Killingtons a few times and the food and service were just average. We thought we'd give it another shot tonight, but upon entering a fairly empty restaurant at 5:00pm with my family (party of three) we were told by the host that there would be a 20-30 minute wait for a table. The restaurant was VERY empty, so I questioned why we couldn't be seated to which the host responded \"I can seat you but it will be a while before anyone can help you. We are expecting several large parties tonight and we had a busy lunch\".  Not sure what a \"busy lunch\" has to do with it but maybe the chef or servers needed a quick nap.   At this point, the manager/owner joined the conversation but said nothing to indicate that he was at all interested in accommodating us. Instead, he let three potential customers walk out of his near-empty restaurant.   We left and ate nearby and as we walked by Killingtons thirty minutes later, the restaurant was still nearly empty and the tables that were expected to be full were still vacant. The reality is that we could have been in and out long before their big parties even arrived.   Strikes one, two and three Killingtons. Done with you.",
