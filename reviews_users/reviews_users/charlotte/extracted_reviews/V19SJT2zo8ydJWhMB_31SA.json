Looking forward to checking this place out, we dined in late on a Sunday evening after a busy weekend. It wasn't very busy, we walked in and ordered. Sadly, they were out of lamb for their Gyros and were out of the pasta salad. The hostess was apologetic, but i was really craving a lamb Gyro.   We both ordered the grilled chicken Gyros with different sides and the Taziki app.  The customer service was great, the food was just okay in my book. This place reminded me of a Greek version of a Panera.  A lot more of a chain type fast casual place than I was expecting. Not a bad quick, relatively healthy option if you're out and about, but I don't think I will be visiting this place again.",

Seriously, they were all incredibly hospitable and about as welcoming as I've seen at a restaurant of this type. They have daily specials, and on Mondays it was the Turkey and Egg sandwich, so I went with that. Comes with chips and a side for about $9. I took my order to go and it was about 5-7 minutes before it came out. The sandwich was absolutely delicious - thinly sliced delicious smoked turkey with thinly sliced hard boiled egg, lettuce, tomato and a mayo that tasted homemade on buttery sourdough bread. I'm a bit concerned about how long this place will last because there were only a few people here at dinner time (which is part of the reason for the review) but I'll certainly be back again soon.",

I got the chargrilled lamb with basmati rice and salad. The lamb was super dry and had no seasoning whatsoever. There wasn't much rice on my plate but what I tried was fine but needed more salt. The salad which was most of the plate was alright but I've had better Greek dressing that tastes better or even has some taste. My boyfriend got the lamb gyro and said the same about the dryness and flavorless lamb. He said it was really tough and chewy. The service was excellent though.",

The prices were also reasonable. Finally, the customer service was excellent. The woman working the register brought us our food, bussed our table, and offered us free chocolate cake and baklava before we left (all with a smile on her face). I have no complaints.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch on a Sunday. Restaurant was mostly empty. Staff were very friendly and attentive but the food was less than mediocre. Namely, the chicken was tougher than jerky. I got the Greek salad add chicken, wife got the chicken roll-ups, both were okay except the chicken was pretty much a chore to eat. I have had beef jerky that's softer than this chicken. The reason? They pre-cook the chicken then re-heat it on the flat top to order. This is never going to result in tasty juicy tender chicken. I can't speak for the other proteins because we only had chicken. Hopefully they aren't pre-cooking and reheating the salmon too!!!  Taziki's, let me know when you start cooking food to order and I'll be back, until then I will avoid you and recommend everyone else does too.  Again, this is no fault of the staff, they were quite pleasant.",

Since we had never tried it, we ordered the Hummus w/ soft pita and the Pimento Cheese with toasted pita (love that you have a choice of mixing them or having one or the other) - both dishes were good. Not the most awesome hummus ever, but definitely good. I had the steak gyro (no onions add cucumber) for dinner w/ a side of potatoes and pasta salad. Both the gyro and the potatoes were awesome and I would definitely get them again. I probably won't get the pasta salad again. The BF got the grilled chicken dinner with the salad and potatoes and he said everything was tasty and he would order it again. We'll definitely be back!!",

I promise you if anyone went on google and tried recipes out it would probably be more authentic than Taziki's.  By the way, you spelled \"Tzatziki\" incorrectly. ;)",

Everything was delicious and fresh tasting! I am so picky about chicken and it was fantastic! The service was extremely friendly too. Everyone behind the counter said hi and had a smile on their face. I can't wait to come here again! Perfect place for lunch after a long run on the sugar creek greenway!",

You order your food from a cashier up front, take a number, sit down and wait for them to bring it to you.   I love Middle Eastern food and was looking forward to checking out Tazikis. The food is...okay. The menu is somewhat limited and uninspired. They have the usual gyros, hummus and pita and chicken-lemon soup, but not much else in the way of Middle Eastern food. Where's the falafel? Where's the tabouleh salad? Where's the shawarma? Where's the baba ganoush?   I ordered a grilled chicken basil gyro with a side of chicken-lemon soup and a \"fresh side\" of roasted potatoes. They accidentally left the tzatziki sauce off of the gyro. No big deal, but, a little funny given the name of the restaurant. The chicken on the gyro was a little dry and ho hum. The soup had a little too much lemon, but was, otherwise, good.   I also thought it was a bit overpriced. The lunch special for the day was a pasta dish with capers and chicken, but was $10 for a modest lunch portion.   Overall, it was okay, but I'll probably head over to Jasmine Grill on South Blvd, the next time I'm in the mood for Mediterranean food.",

I would also suggest cutting up the chicken breast into bite size pieces instead of one long strip that I have to chew with my teeth.

I wouldn't recommend purchasing this Wednesday special. They were tiny rolls with a small side of salsa, nothing else.   The second time we decided to dine here. We ordered the chicken feast for takeout and were pleasantly surprised. I thought the salad and house dressing was delicious and fresh. The tzatziki sauce was herbaceous and tangy.

I have read some of the reviews that the menu is somewhat limited, but I think that is the trade off for the lower prices and super quick service. I eat here frequently and enjoy their greek salad with chicken. The hummus is also good. The service has always been great.  A bonus is that it's right across from The Met, so you can grab a quick bite to eat while you shop.",

We did wish for baba ghannouj and there was none. :( Four stars or not, I highly recommend this place. The service was awesome.",

So when you walk in you just head straight toward the back wall to order. I didn't see the ting signs hanging at first, and the nice man behind the low wall saw me looking around like a lost puppy and directed me to the register to order. There's no signs to look at, or pictures... what you have is the menu that sits in a box to the right, across from the register. I would have completely missed it had he not pointed it out.  Staff is super friendly and  greet everybody coming in. That's a nice but not uncommon touch. I ordered Greek salad with lamb. Everything tastes fresh and nicely seasoned. Lamb was perfectly pink in the middle .salad and tomatoes were nice and crunchy fresh. Tomatoes perfectly ripe. I think the price is fair, and definitely on the same level vs. quantity you'd get at Zoe's Kitchen.  I'll definitely come back, there's too much on the menu to ignore!",

The roll up looked very plain (of course their pictures always look great on the menu) but the chicken was surprisingly juicy and paired great with the fresh salsa. I was also quite pleased with the salad.  My girlfriend ordered the Grilled Beef Tender Gyro and got fruit as her side.  The beef was really tender and although it wasn't the best gyro I've had in Charlotte, it was still pretty good.   Overall, I like that it adds more options to the area. It's not a place where I'd recommend  foodies to venture to but if you're in the area and looking for a quick bite that hits the spot, then you won't be disappointed here.",

There are no grill marks on the chicken, it tastes sauteed, and the pita is soggy.  The potato chips thrown in just add insult to injury.  My favorite thing is the side of rice which was cooked correctly and had citrus flavoring.  But not really enough reason to come back when Zoe's is a block away.",

It's located right by the Metropolitan shopping center (Target, etc) on S. Kings Dr.  The restaurant is large and inviting and is located in a small strip mall.  The staff at Taziki's were the some of the nicest restaurant employees I've ever met.  We striked conversations and bantered about their pumpkin carving contest.  They all seemed like they liked working at the restaurant!  I wanted something on the healthy side, so I ordered their Greek salad with grilled lamb on top, along with a small bowl of their lemon chicken soup (which comes with rice apparently, but they ran out).  The Greek salad was very fresh and the lamb (3 pieces) were grilled to perfection, though not very seasoned.  The lemon chicken soup had plenty of chicken in it and was actually very lemony and sour, which I liked.  The salad dressing is one of the tastier ones I've had at a chain as well.  Will definitely be grabbing this for dinner very frequently from now on - delicious and healthy salads and soup!",

    "text": "It's cute.   I parked to get some Chipotle for lunch but figured I'd try this new spot. I remember seeing this place as it was beginning to open and I've been disappointed before by other places offering my beloved chicken gyro but what the hell... I can have Chipotle another day when I forget to bring a lunch.   It's a bit confusing for some I gather because while I pay attention to the sign that's towards the back of the restaurant indicating where orders are placed, there are some who walk right down to the back and stand right next to me rather than behind me waiting to order. They should place some signage near the doors to indicate where to go to order... some people are clueless... or just don't follow directions. Aight... I have a space issue. I don't like people up in my space. There I said it!   As regular as it is, I had to order the chicken gyro. I had to see if it would live up to my beloved chicken gyro from Greek Fiesta in the Raleigh/Durham area and well... it did. yay! I decided on the pasta salad as the lady told me it was a pretty popular side item and I discovered it also comes with some potato chips. the pasta salad was actually pretty good. I'm not down for cold pasta but this worked, especially with a bit of saltiness from the feta. At times there was a bit too much salt from the feta and the dressing. They may want to figure out how to tone that down a bit.   So I took one star off because I get that they're trying to keep it healthy. 'ppreciate it! However, for us fatty folks or people that can splurge on their calories for a moment may appreciate some seasoned fries. Okay okay I'm just trying to turn my meal into what Greek Fiesta offers. I'm tellin you a chicken gyro with some seasoned fries be on point my people. My recommendation is that they throw that in the mix as an optional side item. You really can't go wrong. I bet that would be a great marketing \"tool\" for the younger folks who need a little fat in their lives. (not trying to make it a place for kids to kick it). But I mean you have Baklava and chocolate cakes staring me in the face when I order. Throw some fatty fries up in the mix and let's just go crazy with calories. Okay I'm done.   I'll go back. I don't eat fast food but it may be worth it to drive to Bojangles to get my seasoned fries to go with my gyro.... okay enough about the fries.   They were quick and speedy with my meal. As a new place I hope they keep it up. We all know how some places like to go down hill when they've been in the game for a while.",

I really didn't know what to expect, there were a few people in line but it went quickly (order, get number and they bring the food out to you). Side bar; the girl taking orders was very friendly! I got a Greek grilled chicken salad. Veggies were super fresh and chicken was lightly seasoned. The chicken was okay, I didn't really taste the Greek seasoning like I thought I would. I wish there was a side of pita on the salad, the baked pita chip I had was too hard to eat and just blah.  Staff was super friendly and was very attentive to us.",

When you walk in, there are paper menus for you to browse with a standing area. When you keep walking you then order at the register. There is only 1 register so be patient and it takes time for the card receipt to print out of you pay with card.   Staff is very friendly and professional. At times, I had resting bitch face while in line and 1 of the cooks joked with me as we began to laugh and I realized that I was just super hangry.   My coworker ordered the chicken breast feast with roasted potatoes. I ordered the Greek salad chicken gyro with a side of fruit and pasta salad (comes with 1 side by default). We also ordered dessert of 1 cookie and chocolate cake and split it. The food was surprisingly delicious and very flavorful. My coworker loved her feast. I really love that the chicken for my gyro was well seasoned. The pasta salad was ALMOST as good as mine- I just needed a few olives in it. The fruit was super fresh.  DON'T SKIP THE DESSERT. I'm so serious.  Price point is perfect. Staff is friendly. They have beer and wine. Ambiance is appropriate for personal or business. Basically, this place is perfect in my book.",

I'm not a baklava connoisseur, but I know what I like and it was a darn good way to complete the meal.  I was very impressed with the customer service. It was Chick-Fil-A level friendliness. Especially considering that I came in accidently two-minutes before closing (didn't know until after they took my order). The manager was also really friendly and I noticed he was really encouraging to his staff, directly telling them in specific ways they were doing a good job.  This is a great drop in place for quick casual or it is nice enough that you could have a mid-week date. I can't wait to come back. The dilemma will be if I try something else or  enjoy that lamb gyro again.",

The food was very good for the price, and the service was really, like reeeeeeally nice. To be clear, we did not have to pay since it was a fundraiser, but the prices were listed on the menu and I would have been glad to pay them.   I had the tilapia feast which was grilled tilapia with a Greek side salad and roasted potatoes. It was pretty tasty. A nice change of pace from the typical fast-casual fanfare. My boyfriend got the lamb gyro which came with his choice of a side and chips. He got the cucumber tomato salad which was surprisingly fresh. We split a piece of baklava and it was good, nothing astounding but still tasty.   They have a selection of wine, and might have beer. I only had water to drink but appreciate having the option to order a glass of wine.   The feel of the place is open and bright. There are large prints of photos which we found out were photographs the founder had taken on his trips to Greece. I like that added touch of personality.   All in all, I don't think I'd frequently go out of my way to eat here simply because it's not conveniently located to me. But if I find myself in the midtown area around lunch or dinner time, this is definitely a place I'd visit again.",

You order at the counter, take a number, and they bring your meal out when it's ready; however, it didn't feel like fast food... it's a smidgen nicer. Napkins and plasticware are on the tables, and the staff is always coming around to take your trash, check-in, etc.  I'm trying to watch my girlish figure, so no hummus for me (boo hiss), which is why I can't give it 5 stars (I need to know what your hummus tastes like before I start making it rain stars). I got the Taziki's Feast with grilled shrimp, basmati rice, and substituted a fruit cup for the cucumber & tomato salad. The shrimp was perfect, but more surprisingly, the rice was out of this world! It almost had a light lemon taste to it, and I literally ate every single grain. I wish there were more of everything, but that's probably more a knock on my diet than their portions.",

But if you take a look even farther back into this little center you'll find an even better stop in Taziki's.  Though it can get crushed at lunch time, and the line to head through the register is a bit awkward - they don't really have a menu board or anything like it, you just pick up your menu in line and order when you get to the front - all in all it works okay. Since it can take a few minutes to get there, you have time to peruse said menu and figure out what you want. And change your mind a few times along the way.  They give you a number and a few minutes later you get your dish. The oddity here is that the number doesn't seem to matter much. More often than not they will come out, ask you what you had as if you didn't even have a number - and sometimes not take it. So I'm not really sure the purpose that the number serves, since they can have problems with it.  Some items are better than others, and while sometimes the order comes out really fast, other times it comes out really slow. It could be that they are giving you what someone else ordered because of the number fiasco and you just answer \"yep, that's me\". Still, overall the food is a pleasant change from some of the other stuff around.",

The combination of the pesto aioli, grilled zucchini, squash, peppers, and tomatoes wrapped together was a mountain of flavor in my mouth.

I ordered and paid online for pickup and it was already prepared and waiting by the time I arrived.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful and I'm looking forward to ordering from here again.  I forgot to sign up for their rewards in the store, but I can opt for signing up via the app.    Once I'm eating meat and dairy again, I'll give their other gyros and entrees a try.  So far, the grilled veggie gyro is my go-to!!",

Their roasted potatoes were horrible as well, also dry and tasting of stale old potatoes. Being my first visit and experiencing such poor preparation of food I am certain I will not return. There is a positive to this place, they have chewable ice which is great with sweet tea!   The service was friendly but that chicken needs MAJOR help!!",

    "text": "Quick Mediterranean food done well  is how I sum up Taziki's Mediterranean. I was really impressed with the speed of the order process and the arrival of my food. It was literally no more than 10 minutes total.   I ordered the Basil Pesto Chicken Gyro with roasted potatoes and got a side of chips also!!!  The flavor was really good for both items and I appreciated that I was able to sub red onions for tomatoes with out a fuss or charge. The roasted potatoes have a good lemon flavor and the pesto was a good consistency. And pesto lovers will really appreciate the taste consistency.   The atmosphere was super chill and the parking lot was empty. It was 5:30pm on a Thursday evening but I was super grateful. The staff was helpful and attentive. The menu offers a variety of options.   I will be definitely be back.   Taziki's Mediterranean 205 S Kings Dr, Ste 100 Charlotte, NC 28204 Thursday December 7, 2017 5:30pm",

    "text": "Sometimes I feel so uninspired for lunch on the weekend.  I might want a salad, but I'm not in the mood for a sandwich...I don't want to eat fast food, yet I don't want a sit-down restaurant with someone waiting on me...oh and I don't want to stray too far from the Target in midtown because I'm hungry.  So that pretty much leaves me with nothing...until I remembered Taziki's.  When you walk in, you go all the way to the end of the hall where you order at a counter.  The person taking the order was pretty friendly.  When we ordered drinks, they handed it to us already filled with the crushed, chewable ice, which I loved.  They have a small covered patio with about 8-10 tables.  When you pay, they give you a numbered card, so they know what table to bring the food to when serving.  We got a lamb pita with garlic sauce and a greek salad.  Both dishes were pretty good.  Overall, I would say this place is a good alternative if you want something fairly quick, but you don't want a sandwich or something at the drive-thru.  Food is pretty good and basic (can't say \"OMG this is amazing\" but definitely wouldn't say \"Oh this place sucks\").  They have healthy options on the menu, and I think it's a great place to head when you are feeling uninspired by the food choices around you.",

The cashier immediately greeted me and asked if I was ready to order. Advised no since this was my first time here. I ordered the greek salad add chicken. My daughter ordered the grilled cheese sandwich. The best thing about this place was the crushable ice. That's a shame. The wait was not so long. We decided to stay and eat. Plenty of napkins at the table. Very clean. Lovely music. Okay my grilled chicken was wrapped in foil and the chicken was a bit tough. I will even add that it tasted like it was a day old. Come on, Day 'Ol Chicken, on a Friday! This is a crime somewhere! I took the chicken back and exchanged for the shrimp. Figure I'd give this place another chance while I'm still here. Several minutes later, I received my shrimp salad.  Shrimp was good (all 7of them).  Oh yeah the grilled cheese was meh! My daughter did not finish her sandwich so I decided to taste it.  Processed cheese. On a Friday! This Must be a crime in at least 4 countries! Fool me can't get fooled again.....",

I was starving last night, and my heart sank when I saw the line at Chipotle. I checked out Taziki's on Yelp, and I'm so glad that I did. With exception to the bread, pita chips, and one particular sauce, everything on Taziki's menu is gluten free. (Yay!!!) I went with the grilled vegetable plate, and it was delicious!! The veggies were spiced and grilled to perfection. I don't know what is in their veggie marinade, but I wish that I did because it was just that good. I took one star off because the price is a bit high and the ordering process could be a bit clearer (you grab a small paper menu just inside the door and order at the counter), but I will definitely be a regular customer. It's hard to find a place to eat both \"clean\" and gluten free, so Taziki's is a gem in my book.",

Lesson we learnt is, if we are hungry for Mediterranean we wouldn't go to Taziki's Mediterranean Cafe.  not that the food is bad, it is alright, decent portions, flavor is almost close, nice ambience and only a little over priced (probably they use organic stuff, I don't know).  so the 2 stars is not because of food, ambience, staff, price or anything but its for not meeting our expectations.",

We decided to make a quick change of plans and changed our course to head into Taziki's to try it out. We were really impressed with the inviting decor inside the restaurant and the friendly service that we received from the staff. I ordered a Grilled Chicken Basil-Pesto Gyro (with a side of Taziki sauce) and the fresh pasta salad as my side. Both were delicious! The chicken in the gyro was full of flavor and the taziki sauce was as fresh as it could get. The pasta salad was also quite tasty - not overpowered with some kind of oily dressing (as some restaurants tend to do) and you could really taste the flavors from the herbs, feta, and tomatoes that they used in the pasta salad. My co-workers agreed that we would definitely be making Taziki's one of our regular lunch spots. A nice addition to the Metro area!",

The hummus trio came with 3 different types of hummus but none of them were that great.  The original was my favorite but was runny, and the basil could have been good but there was way too much basil and not enough hummus.  I would honestly suggest going to Zoe's across the street even though it gets crowded at lunch time.  I will say that this place does seem to have fresh food, it just wasn't worth the time or money.

    "text": "Overrated. Terrible food at a decently expensive price. We ordered chicken pita and baba ghanoush. The chicken was very rubbery and included fat that wasn't cut from the meet and the bread was very tough and flavorless. Perhaps we just made bad choices and other items on the menu are more tasty? The ambience is great and I really wanted to love this place.",

    "text": "I just ate at Taziki's today for the FIFTH time since they have opened, which hasn't been that long (maybe a month?). I've had the lamb and chicken gyros (the marinated and grilled chicken is insanely delicious and reigns supreme over the lamb IMHO), the lemon chicken soup (also delicious!), and their Greek salad. Everything I have had there has been awesome, though as some others have mentioned, the lamb could be a little bit juicier/ more tender. But given everything else, I can't help but give this place 5 stars.  Tonight I picked up a family meal for takeout - $32 for Greek salad, pitas, meat of choice, Tzaztiki sauce, and a side. This was supposed to be for 4 people, but I swear I could've fed 8 easily. The amount of chicken and sides you get is insane. I mean really, I think we could be eating their grilled marinated chicken for the next few days. I'm already planning on using the chicken in other recipes just because there is so much of it left over. And did I mention that it is frickin' delicious? Hot or cold, in a pita or by itself. I love this place and it will likely continue to be a weekly stop for me.  Don't expect fine dining, but I would put this place on par with Panera as far as the ordering experience goes. You walk up to a counter to order and pay, then wait for your food to be delivered or ready for takeout. The service is super-fast - even at the lunchtime rush, I have not waited more than 5-7 minutes from walking in the door to getting my order. Also, beer and wine are served, though I haven't imbibed on that yet during a visit.",

Gyro was kinda small and the side was really bland. Glancing at the rest of the menu it seems really over priced for the market. Others restaurants in town served better quality for half the price.",

We previously ate at one of their restaurants in Charleston and are glad they opened one in Charlotte.  It is a welcome addition to the area and we will definitely return soon.",
