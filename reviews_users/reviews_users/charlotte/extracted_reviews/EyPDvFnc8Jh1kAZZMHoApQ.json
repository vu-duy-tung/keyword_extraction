Traditional pizza pricing has been thrown out the window, with any combination of toppings will cost you the same. Although approaching the counter can seem a daunting experience, the staff (especially at this location) will be happy to help guide you. You can be certain that no matter what, your toppings will be correct and they will be on your pizza exactly the way you want them. The service is exceptionally quick as well.  Mod is a refreshing take on pizza places. I got a Mod with: red sauce, mozzarella, spinach, sundried tomato, arugula, bacon, mushrooms, artichokes, and a pesto drizzle. All for the same price as the base Mod-sized pizza.   The decor is post-naughties, very modern. The music is good.   The only concern that I have about Mod Pizza is that there won't be one when I go back home to Tampa.   I am glad that I decided to stop in for some dinner.",

The cool thing here is that you pay like $8 for whatever medium sized pizza you want. The toppings are all included. You want to try a bit of everything, but the menu does not lay out what they have well. You basically get a list of things that they may or may not have and then everything they do have isn't even on the menu. They have a lot of starter pizzas, but they're all over the place and it's hard to find a solid starter and add onto it. Eventually it turned into a subway experience with me pointing through the glass at what I wanted, which made the menu feel useless. Other than the intimidating first ordering process, everything else was great. The pizza was like an 8 out of 10 and the service was nice. The place is very trendy. It's not a place that I would take a date, but it's a perfect spot for hanging out with friends. When I went, it wasn't really busy, so not too many customers were talking, but it sounded like the staff was really loud. It's kind of understandable because the kitchen is not separate from the dining area, but I'd hate to here the place on a really busy day. Overall I loved the place and I'm probably going back with more friends.",

Well Mike, the district manager for MOD, reached out to me the very next day after my review posted and genuinely apologized for the incident. He ensured me that all cashiers would be properly trained and that this wouldn't happen again and even sent me a gift card so that I would give MOD another chance. My mom and I took my two boys last week and when we asked for a cup with lid for my son the cashier handed it right over. I could tell that Mike followed through and made sure that everyone was properly trained. We had a great and stress-free dining experience and the food was great as always!

    "text": "I went here once, the other day, and am very happy that i did. So much so that this might be my favorite pizza place nearby now.   You go in and pick your size crust. They then ask you to choose every ingredient you want, from the sauce to the seasoning. They also have various pre-made guides for those that want to try their specialized recipes and you can add or omit from them as you please. Basically, it's whatever you want.  Personally, I like that I can create my own from scratch, but since I plan to come here often, I may just GO CRAZY and try one of their already made recipes that require no thought on my part.   Also, their prices are pleasantly reasonable considering that you can get a filling pizza that you designed yourself. Despite what at least one reviewer has said, Mod's medium size is not the same as a small/personal size everywhere else. It is more in line with a fancy thin crust pizza from the frozen food section at a grocery store.  Anyway, I'm speaking in terms of size only here, not taste or freshness or anything like that. The food here definitely tastes fresh to me.  You may just want to review other reviewer's pictures, and note that they have a large size that I'm sure one extra hungry person can stuff themselves on.   So you finish your pizza design and then go pay. You can get your drink, sit down, chat for a few minutes, and then when they call your name (and likely look at you directly), you go get it. They even offer to put some extra sauce or seasoning on top of it if you want.   I got my pizza back and was immediately surprised at how much it transformed. I admit, when they were making it, I was thinking to myself, \"man, they should put a little more love and care into it. Gosh, it's just heaped into a pile.\" You ever eat a burrito at Taco Bell and it's like all the cheese is on one end and the sour cream or whatever is at the other (which sucks by the way)? Yeah, that's what I was thinking when they were putting my pizza together, except that everything was just in the middle. In a pile. I thought I would have just a bunch of burnt toppings on top of melted cheese.   HOWEVER. When I got it back, cooked, I was very pleased with myself for designing the best pizza ever.  It was good too. I mean, really good.  I guess maybe the person cooking evened it out... or something, I don't know, but it was just marvelous. It tasted great.  The atmosphere was standard. Not cozy, not crowded, not bare and clinical (like a hospital). Just a normal place. Similar to.... let's see... Firehouse Subs kind of, but bigger, I would say. I found it funny that one reviewer mentioned employee break room because when I was there not only were a few employees eating or hanging out, but employees from nearby businesses where there eating as well. It's like it was Rivergate's lunch break. I couldn't care less about that though.    All in all, I was just impressed with how the pizza turned out and tasted and I loved the concept.",

They have a menu with about 10 pizzas, but if you want a topping that's not already included, you can simply ask them to add it. I love love love that they don't charge extra for any toppings.   I got the Dillon James because I like simple red sauce pizzas, but added pepperoni and onion. Delicious. The thin crust is crispy and chewy all at the same time.   The vibe is casual but hip. A great place to come with family and friends, or even to grab a bite alone.   I'll definitely be coming here for pizza from now on. Thanks Mod for opening up in Charlotte, especially in Steele Creek!",

You know, the \"hello\" as EVERYBODY walks in the front door. Place is new and there are a few kinks to still work out. Understandable. I am sure they will get there. Service was pretty good. You walk-in, order and then pay. They write your name on the paper that goes under the pizza. Lots of toppings to choose from. I ordered a Caesar salad and Dillion James. Salad was ready in minutes. Pizza was ready in about 5-6 minutes. Salad was good.  The pizza-eh, it was not good at all. The crust is formed out of a dough ball that is pressed flat by a machine, topped and then put in the oven. The dough was overly chewy, cheese just melted but not cooked long enough for my liking.  The dining environment-nice but seriously felt as if I was sitting in an employee break room. Manager or owner sitting in the left corner on laptop, crew on break eating and sitting, working staff constantly coming over to chat with those in the corner. Oh, and those folks yelling \"hello\" was even more annoying. Just didn't make for a nice dining space.  This place is probably nice for a family of four with young kids.  Would I go back, no. Would I recommend, no. There are other similarly branded concepts that are legit and better. Maybe the pizza I had was just off, but the environment was less than desirable.",

The day we went was chilly and there was constant air blowing out of the vents onto us.  The other was that 4 to 5 employees sitting at tables by themselves as the dinner rush was on.  One employee actually laid her head on the table as if to be asleep, hair and all.  Just where I want to sit with my food.",

The girl who was reluctantly assisting us asked if the g-free pizza was a preference or an allergy. We stated (allergy) at which point she reached in the cooler/freezer to pull out a pre-made g-free crust (she did not change her gloves, & actually took a regular crust off an aluminum pan & put the g-free crust directly on the contaminated aluminum pan). I will NEVER eat @ this establishment & I would recommend that anyone who has to eat g-free to avoid this place.",

There is also outside seating which is nice for warm days like today. The only reason I gave them a four star instead of five is the pricing. So for my pizza (pictured) it was $8.00 if you come with a family you can easily spend $50 on pizza which is is way to much in my opinion when you can go to an Italian place and get a whole big pie, drinks, and a salad at that price.",

So, if I want the \"real thing,\" I have to get on a plane, or go to one of the few places that get it pretty close.   MOD is not trying to be that kind of place. Rather, they give you EVERY choice you could want on a thin crust style in just a few minutes.   Think of this like a certain sub shop or that burrito place that hollers welcomes when you walk in the door...only with PIZZA!!  They have some pre-designed pies, or you can tell your pizza production person EXACTLY what ingredients you would like to add to your pie.   When customers enter, everyone proclaims an enthusiastic \"Hello!\" Or \"Welcome!\" They wave and smile like you are a long lost friend. Some customers even get in the act and holler greetings, too (we did). It's hard not to smile with all that love floating around.   A group from work went for lunch. Since the pies are personal size, we could each get what we wanted and even share/taste each other's creations if we wanted.   For my first time, I decided to go with a pre-designed menu item, so I had the Calexico. Appropriately spicy, it was just what I was looking for. Next time I'll be brave and design my own.  Our group decided that we'll definitely go back for lunch soon.",

    "text": "AWESOME pizza place. Let's start with when you walk in, all the staff members welcome you, total plus if you are like me and those things matter. You get to see all the ingredients, kinda like subway or chipotle only its for pizza or salad. You can add anything you want for the same price. Also, if you come with a family or have a larger stomach to fill, try the mega size. It's two of the mod size pizzas on top of each other. The bottom pizza is cheese and the top is anything you want. If you are a pesto fan, add it to your piZza !!!!  In addition, they have a sauce called the sriRancha it's sriracha sauce and ranch mixed. I was a little weary of it but OMG! So good. It's a perfect mix of spicy and ranchy lol! Next, I tried the cookies and cream milkshake. Normally I wouldn't order a milkshake but he got me when he said it was made with oreos. Holy smokes, so good. Especially for someone who doesn't like milkshakes! Last thing, do I recommend? YES! YES! YES! YES! This is my third time in a week, let's just say when I like a place, I will be back several times.",

    "text": "I hadn't even tasted the food yet, but the customer service had already left a bad taste in my mouth. I had never eaten at a MOD pizzeria before, but a friend wanted to go, so I obliged.  When I asked Edrick (don't know if I got the spelling right), the gentleman making my pizza, what was good, I was answered with a very mumbled and lackluster \"Man, I don't know what you like. Our tastes are different\" to which I answered \"That's ok! Just make it how you would eat it.\" I was in the mood to try something new. The reply I got, once again mumbled and now in a fed up tone, was \"Man, what do you want on your pizza.\" So, I just ended up ordering a pepperoni pizza with oregano. Pretty basic. Now that I've tried the pizza, I can say that it honestly is not worth the trouble or the price. I could have bought a $3 pizza from Walmart and it would have been just as good. I also would not have had to deal with Edrick's (once again, don't know the spelling) customer service. I do not think I will be returning to MOD any time in the foreseeable future... Oh, the oregano was pretty good.",

Now mistakes happen I understand but rudeness of the young lady working the finishing area with the rainbow sticker on her hat when asked to fix the pizza was unlike anything I have ever experienced. We presented her with the pizza and showed her was was wrong and with a extremely annoyed look on her face said \"Well what do you want me do about\" not offering to make a new one or comp the mistake she made(in the end she made a new one after we had to ask). Some serious training overhaul is in order for this location. In addition to the grievances listed above my mom attempted to talk to the manager and not only would he not let her finish a sentence he also seemed really angry to be there. Will not be returning to this location ever again.",

My fiance and I have gone once before on a Tuesday afternoon (4pm), the place was empty so we were able to be attended quickly and receive our food within 15 minutes. Food was decent and the service wasn't good but it wasn't abysmal either.  We went on a Friday (~6:30pm) there was a line and the service was horrible. We waited almost 30 minutes for our food which to our surprise had burnt. We spoke with the employees about our wait and they promised they would start our order again immediately. Another 15 minutes pass by and we see other people order and receive their food before us. They had placed our order last in line behind the customers that had arrived after us. By the time we complained they were barely putting finishing one pizza and setting the other one together.   The absolute worst part of it was having to argue with the manager. I asked for a refund and she only wanted to refund me one pizza although they had already messed up the order and I hadn't even taken a bit of the pizza she claimed \"was what I asked for\". I received the refunds for the pizzas, eventually, but not for the two sodas that we ordered. Now we did drink the sodas but I am a believer that if an establishment like that messes up so royally, it is up to them to make up for their mistakes.  The employees seemed to want to just hang out vs actually help customers.",

It's \"Chipotle\" meets pizza, but they don't charge extra for the \"guacamole.\" Yes, they have a handful of set pizzas on the menu board but as they move your pie along the assembly line, you can add as many toppings as you like. No extra charges!  I looked over the menu board and settled on the \"Season's Mod\" which had roasted Brussels Sprouts, red onions, gorgonzola and a balsamic glaze. And while that probably would have been enough, I also took the recommendation of one of the Mod Squad and added chicken. Good idea!  A few minutes later, my name was shouted and I stepped up to pick up my pie. Sliced into four neat quarters, the thin crust pizza base was nice and crunchy. Plenty of toppings and it tasted absolutely amazing. Full of great flavors. Very enjoyable.  Neat vibe in this fast casual restaurant. It's not a date night place, more the sort that you can bring the whole family.",

The extraordinary part is that they were are all the same price of a low $7.77.   We came in one weeknight and could not have had a better experience. I made a custom pizza with pepperoni, ham, black olives and pineapple. With extra cheese, obviously. Basically all my favorite toppings that I never get together because of the standard per topping price most pizza joints have. My boyfriend got the Jasper, which seemed to be made with him in mind with just spicy sausage and mushroom.  Everyone was super friendly and since he and I like completely different toppings it was great to not have to do the normal compromise dance.   When the worker called me up for our order he explained there was an incident with my boyfriend's pizza and it folded in the oven. Not to worry though because a replacement was already cooking! He boxed up the offending pizza for us to take home. When we opened the box we saw a barely damaged pizza that other places would have served. I couldn't believe the great quality control. They showed me they really care about the product they sell and I was glad they were not wasteful.",

    "text": "It's not often that I give a chain restaurant a 5-star review but this place truly deserves it.  This is a custom pizza (or salad) joint sort of on the lines of chipotle. You choose a base option from their menu or design your own. They have a line that adds whatever toppings you want. Additional toppings for your pizza do not cost extra! Yay! But your options are pretty basic, standard pizza toppings with a few odd ball ones thrown in.  Ater your pizza is made, it is sent to the oven and this is not your conveyer belt oven like some other pizza chains use. This is a gas fired oven where your pizza is monitored by an attendant.   For drinks, they have your typical tea and soda but also offer lemonade, craft beer and a few other specialty drinks.  Service is where this place shines. You are greeted as you walk in the door and everyone is friendly and helpful. On my most recent trip, they noticed something wrong with my coworker's pizza and put it back in the oven and offered him some garlic sticks while he waited. Then they brought the pizza out to him.  Their pizzas taste great. They have a flavorful red sauce. But I would skip the garlic sticks. They were a bit disappointing.",

We both ordered our own pizza, both got the mini, which was the perfect size for us!  With two pizzas and one drink it was around $12.  Very reasonable for lunch!  I couldn't tell you what Kevin ordered, but I ordered pizza with white sauce, garlic rub, 3 different cheeses, chicken, spinach, mushrooms, onions, peppers, and sundried tomatoes.  It was very delicious!  MOD has it down great.  You get all the toppings you could want to create the pizza you want at the same price, brings it out to you very quickly, and creates a pizza with great flavor with plenty of topping choices!    We sat put on the patio area with our dog, so we can see us coming back here with warm weather!  Can't wait to try more pizzas and floats/shakes!  We will be back!",

    "text": "I'm a sucker for a coupon, so after we got one in the mail for a free MOD pizza, the fella and I ventured in on a Friday evening. It definitely has a Chipotle/Chopt feel in that you queue up and order at the counter - either a set pizza (they have 9) or a build your own as you walk down the counter and tell different staff what toppings you want. I opted to make a Hawaiian pizza, and the fella went for the Mad Dog (their version of a meatza) with a few extra toppings since toppings are free.  The fella got a canned beer (they also have a few drafts), and we grabbed a seat to wait for our name to be called. The place itself is pretty stark with concrete floors and aluminum seats/tables, but the massive photo mural on the wall made it feel more cozy.  I missed hearing our name, so our pizza sat on the counter a few extra minutes, but it was still pretty tasty. The crust is thin, and I'm more of a thick crust person, but it was still good. The sauce was on the sweeter side, which I like, and they weren't stingy with the toppings.  Our bill was cheaper than usual because of the coupon, but a four-slice, MOD size pizza is only $7.77, which I think is a good deal. They also have a mini option and a mega option.  I also love that the staff yells \"Hello!\" to every person who walks in. Definite \"Welcome to Moe's\" vibe, but they kept it fun and fresh every time they yelled it.",

It seemed that we arrived before the lunch rush.   I tried to grab a high chair for my nephew, but they were all sticky and covered in crumbs. It was difficult to find a clean table as well. I wiped down a table and high chair with a napkin and we ordered two Caesar salads and a small pizza.  As one of the employees started putting romaine lettuce in a salad bowl, I tried to discretely and politely point out that the bowl was dirty. She said nothing, rolled her eyes, and dumped the lettuce in another bowl (after it had already touched the dirty bowl). She acted bothered as she put together the second salad and started rolling out the dough for the pizza. Her attitude was totally unwarranted.  Even if the dirty bowl hadn't made me totally lose my appetite, there was way too much dressing on both salads and everything was overly salty. My sister felt really ill after we ate. It was a pretty disappointing experience.",

What I was told was crazy!!! I could get whatever I wanted for the menu prize. That's freaking insane. All other pizza places charge you per item but I could get as little or as much as I wanted on this pizza...lets go. Once my order was placed, it spent about 7 minutes in the oven and I was out the door. The pizza itself was good. Some parts of the crust's edge was burnt to a crisp but it wasn't enough to complain about as I understand the oven can get really hot. It was thin and crispy which was nice. The sauce was a good amount as I hate overly sauced pizza. I don't have one near me but if I did I would come back to eat here again.",

One thing I love is customization. When you first order, you can choose one of the pizzas from the wall or start there and add more toppings or you can just say everything you want. Same goes for the salads. All the toppings are fresh and there's a large variety. And you can get as many toppings as you want even proteins at no extra cost. Pizzas go into  brick oven. And the salads are tossed in a huge bowl in front of you.   I'm trying to make better decisions and honestly I love the salads at Mod. Having to choose between pizza and salad is actually hard here. I went with a salad. I got mixed greens, grilled chicken, salami, sliced tomatoes, Greek olives, sweet and spicy peppers, roasted broccoli, parmesan and croutons tossed in Italian dressing. It was light, but full of flavor. The lil' sweet and spicy peppers are my favorite.   Definitely love coming here for a quick bite!",

    "text": "I started this review looking for a reason to give it 4 stars simply because I don't often award chain restaurants such high ratings. But really I can find literally no logical reason to do so. I seriously love Mod and I love this business concept. I don't know if Mod was the chicken or the egg but made to order pizza has become a huge thing quick it would seem. Some call it the Chipotle or Subway of pizza but I call it its own thing. In terms of variety and options: all other made to order restaurants have nothing on Mod.  I can't start without mentioning that the prices are astoundingly low for what you get. You get a personal thin crust pizza with unlimited toppings of your choice for one flat price: $8.52 including tax if you decide to leave no tip. You can upgrade to gluten free crust for a few dollars but that's the only upcharge you'll see. There's the usual red sauce plus add-ons for the sauce such as pesto and some others I've honestly never used. I think I saw a barbecue sauce in there. For toppings, a non-exhaustive list includes: whole garlic cloves, tomato, sundried tomato, red and yellow peppers, green peppers, olives, roasted cauliflower, hamburger, ham, Canadian bacon, pepperoni, grilled chicken, sausage, and on and on. I'm not doing it any justice with my list. At the end of the bacon you can even add one of at least 6 toppings onto the pizza to get even more bang (or zing) for your buck.  There are also several bottled sodas (Boylan) to choose from along with a litany of fountain drinks and even a few beers. You can even round out your meal with a milkshake too. And if you want to forego the carbs entirely there are all of your basic salad greens on the bar with which you can make a stellar salad composed of any or all of the above.  Finally, you can visit and eat here knowing that you're supporting a good cause too. That's because they hire and employee many ex-convicts and people who have served time in prison and would otherwise find difficulty in getting employed again as a result. Very cool!",

    "text": "It's not that I didn't like MOD...I just like Blaze better.   So I'd had this place bookmarked for a while and finally had the opportunity to give them a try. Same concept as Blaze (promise this is the last time I'll bring up the competition, lol) you order your pizza...however you want with as many toppings as you can for one standard price.   Easy enough and I still love the idea of getting whatever I want for the same price!   A HUGE win for them, though is that they offer a mini version. In my opinion it's the perfect size and portion for lunch...and just like the regular size you can get as many toppings as you want.  Since it was my first time I created my own. They have a wall full of already customized pizzas that you can chose from or just need a bit of a head start. I decided to try the white sauce, with the sausages, chicken and bacon and veggies.  I didn't love the white sauce or the crust. It's a thin crust that flaky but I think it's a little too thin and that made it hard to cut and hold the slices. But the toppings were fresh and the service from start to finish was great.   For now...MOD is just ok in my book. But I'm going to give their original sauce a try and see what I think...stay tuned.",

We were excited to try MOD as it was one of the first fast pizza joints we saw pop up in the Charlotte area (since then Blaze and Zblong have joined the party).    I ordered the mini pizza (6\" $4.95) for myself as a BYO. I got the white sauce with a handful of veggies topped with pesto. My husband got a mini as well and we split the garlic strips. The minis were the perfect size and were less than $5. Great to get lunch somewhere cheap! I also liked that they had 3 different pizza sizes to pick from!   The only thing I didn't like was the crust. It tasted like Nann- not pizza dough. It was thin, but too thin for my liking. Also a little burnt on the edges.   The service was great though and the staff greeted everyone as they came in and said goodbye/thank you to everyone who walked out the door- you don't see that much!",

The fact that no matter how many ingredients and toppings you put on pizza its the same price they have 3 different sizes the mini,the mod, and the mega! The most expensive sized pizza is $10 yes you heard it right and i generally get the mini its enough for just me to fill me up and its only $4  and some change, well worth it from everything from the fresh ingredients and sauces. You watch them make it as you tell them what you want on your personalized pie!",

Came here with 5 other colleagues for lunch and immediately noticed that the salads, especially the arugula was wilted and no longer fresh. I, as well as my colleague mentioned this to the associate who didn't even acknowledge this fact, yet sought guidance from another associate. Eventually the salad tray was exchanged with another, same scenario: the arugula was old, wilted and was not suitable to be served. My colleague then overheard the associate asking if they should throw it out, while the other one signaled \"no\".  We were disgusted that this even happened.  #1: why do customers need to bring it to the associate's attention that the salad they're serving is bad?  #2 what kind of associate requires guidance regarding the quality of wilted salad?  #3 where was the manager and inventory of their food?  Not sure I or my colleagues want to come here again as this may only be the surface of poor quality control.",

The topping selection was a bit overwhelming so I went with one of their pre-designed pizzas - the Dillon James - and then added bacon to it.  The pizza tasted great!  It's a thin crust style dough - a bit thinner and crispier than a New York style - and the pizzas are individual sized at 11\".  One minor annoyance was that they cut the pizza into quarters instead of sixths.  Picking up and eating a quarter slice of an 11\" thin crust can be challenging, especially if you get too many toppings. Anyways, for those in Charlotte, I would recommend MOD Pizza over Brixx if your looking for individual-sized pizza.",

If they do come in a thicker crust option, we were not asked or told about it.",

The guy who was outside was now in the kitchen and sensing that something was wrong he asked was my order ok. When I told him that I wanted to add olives and Canadian bacon to my Del Monico, and take off the tomatoes, he immediately sprung into action by making me another pizza, and I had it and was out of the door in seven minutes.

One bad thing was the staff, hot and cold. some were super friendly, some didn't wanna be there. lol",

The only problem I did have was the cashier charging me for a MOD pizza ($7.77) when I ordered the mini ($4.77) with just cheese, pepperoni and pineapple.  I asked her if they were any charges for the toppings but she told me the taxes were $5.... Um okay sure. I looked back at my receipt and then realize she did over charge me. The store manager took care of it with out any hesitation. The prices are reasonable considering the fact there is no extra charge for toppings. The crust is thin so you might not want to pile on to much! They also have a good beverage selection as well.  I do consider coming back next time :)",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to try out MOD after receiving a coupon for a free pizza in the mail. Like another reviewer, I really wanted to like it. The restaurant itself looks very charming and I really liked the idea that you could get as many toppings as you wanted for a flat charge. However, MOD Pizza failed to meet expectations in almost every regard.  The food - While I anticipated that the pizza would be small (we ordered two), a regular sized pizza would be considered a personal pizza almost anywhere else. The dough was extremely thin and chewy. To their credit, the toppings themselves tasted very fresh and were plentiful. They were however extremely light handed with them. We also ordered cinnamon strips with cinnamon sauce. They were in a word, flavorless. They were made from the same thin dough as the pizza, and they were lacking in any type of moisture.  Not even the dipping sauce (which was very good) could save them. It was like eating cardboard.  The atmosphere - The moment you (or any other customer for that matter) walk in the door, you hear a chorus of \"hello\" and the moment you or any other customer leave, you hear a chorus of \"thank you\". After one of two people, it became extremely annoying. The ordering process is also rather cumbersome. As a first time guest, there is no direction or signage indicating that your pizza would be made assembly style. We instinctively walked up to the register to order. What's more, there were far too many people in the kitchen area than what was necessary. There had to be at least 5 people on the assembly line alone. One person put on the sauce, who then passed it to another person to put on the cheese. You also had to order all of your items in this line, even if it was a side that required no assembly. I mistakenly didn't order the cinnamon strips while in line and instead ordered them at the register. The cashier very rudely asked me if I had already ordered them, and if not I needed to get back in line to do so. As I found out, ordering them simply entailed writing my name on a piece of paper under some dough. Service was otherwise OK. Not great.   I can safely say we probably would never go back. Not even order online. That would require having to go in to pay, and to hear that chorus of hello and goodbye again. That alone makes me not want to go back. The cinnamon strips however were the clincher. I would not recommend this place.",
