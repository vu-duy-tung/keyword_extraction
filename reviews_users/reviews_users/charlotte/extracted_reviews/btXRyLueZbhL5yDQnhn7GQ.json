They had it all separated and ready for me to assemble, I only assume this was done to ensure the freshness. I can't remember what everyone else had because I was so engrossed in my meal, but they said it was super tasty... I will definitely be heading back for more.  This prices are really good also. I believe they also have sushi.  Weird thing is that they shut down for a bit midday to set for the dinner service. So phone first.",

    "text": "It's likely a place is going to be either really exciting or really bizarre when there is a Lucite stripper shoe with a melted heel on the sidewalk in front of it. Sadly, Asian Roll & Grill in Tega Cay, South Carolina, wouldn't be classified as really exciting or really bizarre, even though there was a Lucite stripper shoe with a melted heel on the sidewalk in front of it.   The feel of the place is a little incongruent. Tables don't fit quite right within the booths, but that is part of the oddly familiar appeal. The owner and the servers are eager to please without being overzealous, and the dining room is spotless. Over in the bar, the blue tile provides a sleeker background for sushi noshing than the main dining area. Patio dining looks like it would be popular for diners and would draw in other customers. However, even in pretty weather, the umbrellas remain closed and customers are behind windows tinted so dark it is hard to tell if the restaurant is open.  Some not so great things about Asian Roll & Grill: They don't have brown rice, they don't take the skin off of the grilled chicken, and the Vermicelli Bowls are a little heavy on the vermicelli. A certain server will tell you they can't make the Summer Rolls substituting tofu for shrimp. When it is explained to that server exactly how the substitution works, it miraculously happens. (Why wouldn't it be an option? The whole conversation was strange and not due to a language barrier.)  The Pho, though, is well, PHOnomenal (sic). Huge portions of the fresh and comforting soup are Asian Roll and Grill's dish forte. Fresh house made chicken stock mixed with noodles, bean sprouts, cilantro and choice of meat are crave-worthy. Although there isn't a specific children's menu, the Miso soup, Yakitori, large bowls of Edamame and Fried Rice are winners with discerning kids.  As a whole, Asian Roll & Grill is on the cusp of being a favorite small town eatery, especially compared to some of the other Japanese/Chinese/Vietnamese fusion restaurants in the area. With a few small improvements, it could corner the market.",

After days of just dense caloric meals, stumbling upon this place on a Sunday evening was a God send.  I got the brisket pho noodle soup and it was surprisingly VERY good.  It was on par with what you would get in Southern California or Little Saigon.  I know it might sound hard to believe.   The broth was piping hot and well seasoned with earthy aromas.  My girlfriend got two sushi rolls which she also  thought was fresh and delicious.  We also shared a fried gyoza appetizer and was pretty darn amazing too.  Dinner came out to $40 for 4 items.  So for you folks wanting to try some great Vietnamese food, this will hit the spot.  Oh yeah, it's healthy too!",

    "text": "This is a nicely decorated restaurant in a newish shopping strip mall with decent pho at a higher price point than those in the Boston, NY and DC areas. The Pho Dac Biet which should have all toppings was tasty with slices of cooked and rare beef, sliced meatball, and rice noodles swimming in a well-made broth (a bit more peppery than the other pho places). Conspicuously missing from the pho toppings are classics such as tripe and tendons. The Pork Chop Rice Plate only had a pork chop but is missing the savory chopped pork skin and egg omelette. The pho and other dishes tend to be smaller in size and more expensive per serving as compared to the other pho places at major cities. Service was a bit harried in the beginning with a room full of lunch-time diners but it was much improved once some of these diners left. Overall, it is a decent pho place but be prepare to pay more to save you a trip into Charlotte.",

Asian Roll and Grill is very reasonably priced and always fresh. I get the vegetable and tofu pho--the broth is incredible. It's the fastest take-out ever--we've never waited more than 20 minutes from the time we picked up the phone to the minute we walk out the door. My husband likes the chicken fried rice but we both love the Vietnamese rolls--they are so healthy and fresh and very generous in size. Many nights they have half-price maki rolls when you order a full-priced roll order, and that's a great way to try a new kind of sushi. We haven't really eaten inside the restaurant, but for take-out, it's our go-to Asian night restaurant. I took one star away because sometimes they get the order wrong (it's best to check the bag before you walk out the door).",

    "text": "Best pho in Charlotte. Always so fresh and delicious. Their sushi is great also. Gyoza dumplings are amazing and so are the spring rolls. If you don't know what pho is, it's pronounced \"fuh\". A beefy broth with noodles and your choice of cuts of meat.  They give you a plate with fresh basil, parsley, bean sprout shoots, jalapenos, and lime wedges. Add as much or as little as you like. Be careful not to add too much chili paste or Sriracha hot sauce!  I am particularly fond of Fu Dac Biet.  Super-thinly sliced brisket, flank steak, and tendon, along with a nice quartered house-made meatball.  This is the first place I ever tried tendon. The consistency is likened to a slightly chewy, but melt-in-your-mouth Twizzler... But with a slight beefiness. I love it!  The staff here is always very friendly.  Great value.  I gave it only 4 stars because they play the most bizarre mix of teeny-bopper top-40 pop music I have ever heard in a restaurant. But go there with someone you like to converse with, and you won't even notice it...until you start slurping your pho!",

If you're in the mood for Sushi, Udon Soup, Pho, Fried Rice, or several other eclectic selections, then this is your place.  Their appetizer selection is hit or miss. The Calamari is mostly fried batter, while the Summer Rolls (Spring Rolls at most places...) have always been fresh and delicious.   For the main courses, my wife and I have tried a good cross section of their food. I wouldn't put their Pho as the GO TO #1 item on the menu. Honestly, I'm a huge fan of their Udon Soup with Beef, which comes with a hearty helping of vegetables and sauteed beef. Add in a little chili oil and you're in flavor country.  Their sushi is OK. It's one of those things where might order a roll to split while having something else. If my wife and I are ever in the mood exclusively for Sushi, Asian Roll & Grill is not in the rotation.  Some have mentioned, the service is hit or miss depending who you get. We've had fantastic service and we've had bad service.   All in all, we visit Asian Roll & Grill pretty regularly and enjoy the food every time.",

We had a waitress who surprised us with a rose on the table when we got there! Very Valentines appropriate :3 They even let us take it home! and yes, it was a real rose!

It never really wows me, but it does the job.  I have passed by Asian Roll & Grill several times, and after reading reviews I decided to give it a try.  My to-go order consisted of summer rolls and a small Pho Tai.  I was a bit disappointed with the portion size of the Pho for the price, but I would soon get over it.  As usual, the broth was given to me in a plastic container, and all of the noodles and fixins in a styrofoam box. Even rare, the beef looked and smelled amazing.  It was sprinkled with seasonings, and laid on top of the noodles.  Also in the box were the herbs, onions, sprouts, lime, a small cup of hoisin, and a small cup of chili oil.  I could not wait to get back to work as the delicious smells filled my car. The first thing I did was taste the broth.  AMAZING!  I already knew I was in for a great experience.  I added my beef, noodles, onions, sprouts, some hoisin, a dab of chili oil, and OMG...I was in Pho heaven.  I almost forgot for a minute that I had another tasty treat waiting for me.  The summer rolls were fresh and delicious...and the peanut sauce was EVERYTHING!  I am thoroughly pleased with my lunch, and now I am ready for a nap.  Not to mention my white shirt is now littered with Pho-speckles. Asian Roll & Grill will definitely be my go-to for Pho in this area.",

The service is very good, you can tell they try very hard to please you and make sure you enjoy your visit.   I've had the fresh summer rolls which are fantastic. I've had the tempura sweet potato, which is awesome. But I keep coming back for the pho. I haven't even tried anything else on the menu for my main dish.   As I'm typing this I realize I'm going to have to pick some up for dinner, because now I'm craving it again.",

Got home and look and behold there's peanuts still left over. They clearly just try to remove the peanuts and given me same food!!  Having a family member that was allergic to peanut I had to trashed the food. They should have taken allergies more seriously  because it could have killed someone and they could been sued.

I have never been disappointed here, and neither have any of the friends and family I have brought along. The service is also very good.

Let's begin with the food:  The pho was without a doubt, the least flavorful I have ever had...and I've had alot of pho.  If they're building a savory pho from scratch...they sure fooled me, because it tasted like something from powder or a can.  No matter where you get pho, they're going to give you the fresh goodies to go along with the noodles and broth.  This doesn't make the pho itself good.  I won't bother getting into the other dishes tried as they were also mediocre.  The decor of Asian Roll & Grill looks like a DIY project.  There's definitely not a Feng Sui to the place.  The layout is almost uncomfortable and haphazard in a neat and orderly way somehow.  The service was OK, but it didn't matter much considering the less than average fare.  Try:  I'm not really sure what to say here.  The sushi seems to be a hit...but then again...the pho seemed to be recommended as well.    Avoid:  The pho.  Seriously...if you eat pho regularly, you will find this to be a huge disappointment.",

VEGETABLES - carrots, onion, broccoli, zucchini, mushrooms, bok choy, celery and pea pods.  We preferred the pork gyoza but both were tasty.   Gyoza or pot stickers are served with ponzu sauce.  For those who love spice, just ask for Sonny's sauce and it will add a kick to anything you dip or pour it into as my husband did with the udon.   Love my sake.

This came with fried rice- it may have worked in the soup but who knows. I won't be going back.",

It's the day after Christmas, I don't understand why there is only two servers working so I didn't get the good service as a paying customer deserves. Maybe they don't realize that the number of servers affects the quality of service. This is my third time here.

I would rather eat publix sushi than get sushi from this place again.\"  I'll attach some pictures of tempura veg and tempura sweet potato and cream cheese (#3&4)...while the employees were very apologetic and quickly re-made my 2 rolls, you could tell they did it more quickly than they should have.  the pieces were too big to eat with chopsticks (which we did not receive) and just didn't taste good.    I don't normally write negative reviews, but for $30, you can get 4 much tastier rolls elsewhere.  ru san's is still the #1 place for sushi in charlotte.",

However, While Asia Roll & Grill is highly rated, this was a let down.  The pros, great service..... the cons, the wait for food and the sushi.  Please stop serving and calling yourself a sushi bar, your not.  Stick to the China / Pho route as this is what your good at.  The sushi is not good, unless you call sushi a fried roll with fired fish (what are you hiding) in lieu of what is sushi is, good sashimi grade fish.  Examples you say,  the sashimi octopus looked like a dried up anchovy/mushroom and the tuna sashimi was three pieces of paper thin..... paper.  Unfortunately my search for good sushi in the Fort Mill area continues.",

They're like little dumplings stuffed with pork and vegetables, and usually served alongside green vegetarian option and soysauce-based sauce. I also would recommend the sushi as well, always fresh tasting and good quality. Sometimes the sweet tea is mixed with a hint of jasmine that isn't overpowering but a very refreshing twist on the classic southern beverage.  Overall, this is a place I will continue to bring my friends, dates, and family to.",

There were a couple of TVs as well. There seemed to be one lady working the front of house. The menu has sushi, Vietnamese and Japanese selections. I wanted sushi and soup.   So we shared a bagel roll as an appetizer and both ordered the bun bo hue which was like a spicy pho soup. The sushi was just okay to me. The soup was amazing. First off it comes in one size and is huge. It also had a good amount of beef in the soup. It was served with all the toppings to add on. It was spicy and for once I didn't need to add any additional heat. It also was savory with hints of lemongrass and basil. Both of us took leftovers home.   Service was okay. We were towards the back and it was sometimes hard to get our server's attention.   Overall a good experience, but don't expect anything fancy here. Just some tasty pho and soup.",

    "text": "Not sure why I'm trying to help this business other than the fact that I liked their food in the past (I'll get to that in a minute).  I've been told by a waitress/former employee of Asian Roll & Grill that it is now under new ownership, but she works for the new owners. The new restaurant is called Pho & Sushi. She said the new owners offer fresher ingredients and the menu has changed. I posted pics of the new menu scanned from what she gave me.  I have not eaten any food under the new ownership, I'm sure I'll try it in the next few days, but to get back to why I'm trying to help them...I feel like they're just re-branding this restaurant and perhaps the owner has only changed within the family? Regardless, it needed it. Why? Well, it didn't get the greatest of reviews sometimes, but the actual fans lauded it. I, for one, absolutely loved their pho, especially the pho tofu with vegetables in beef broth. The veggie broth was equally as good, but this was a personal preference for my wife and myself. I read reviews of people that didn't like the service or that during lunch their food took too long or that their take-out was too expensive, etc.  Here's where we get into my helping them for no reason whatsoever. I've never had a bad experience with this restaurant, other than the fact that over a period of 3 years, they reduced the amount of tofu in their pho from 6 pieces to about 3. My wife and I really didn't mind so much, because the vegetable content was decent enough to fill you up and you always got enough noodles. Their sushi rolls were great and I never had a bad experience with that, either. The Cajun Roll was a killer. Spicey but melt in your mouth. I want them to succeed as a restaurant. However, there have also been a few times where I tried to help them. I told them the day their website went down (it never came back online, by the way), they just kinda shrugged and said \"we know, thanks\". Then, when they offered online ordering/delivery through DoorDash, I tried to explain to them that a whole portion of their menu wasn't available on DoorDash's ordering system and they again just kinda said \"okay, thank you\". I was a little blown away by their response. Some of their most expensive menu items weren't available to order and they didn't seem to care.  Perhaps this was all a cultural thing, which I get, but don't quite understand. I'm willing to help this restaurant succeed within my everyday means of just actually caring a bit (meaning I don't expect to get paid for my menial services), but I think overall they may be lacking in community communication in some ways. Again, it could be a cultural thing, but I'm sure I'll now figure it out in my leisure time and while only ordering food from them when my wife and I want pho and some sushi. (I see there's no pho tofu on their menu now, as well. Bummer.)",

Pho costs about $10 for a medium bowl and $11 for a large, which is a little pricier but I haven't seen many other alternatives nearby, so it's worth it when you're craving that hot bowl of broth & noodles.",

I usually would get the regular but it was always to much for me to eat in one sitting. It does reheat well though. The summer rolls are great but I wouldn't suggest getting the chicken, I usually would get the shrimp. Overall if you like Vietnamese food I would highly suggest this place!",

    "text": "This is a tough one to score. This was a new visit for me as a local and my parents as visitors.  Overall, the food was good. No real issues there. What could use a lot of work is the service. My parents ordered sushi rolls as their app and requested they come out before their entree. They certainly did... if thirty seconds counts. That's not cool. They enjoyed the rolls they ordered and their main rice and meat entrees. I enjoyed my Pho.   Service lacked again when she never asked about more drinks or refills.   The interior needs some help. The booths had tears covered by tape and were pretty uncomfortable to sit in.. Wouldn't rush back, except possibly for take-out.",

    "text": "Updating from my review 3 years ago. This place used to be amazing. Best Pho I had ever had... it has completely changed now.   Our table waited an hour for our food. We never received our goyza appetizer. Tempura fried sushi was way over cooked and also seemed like it had just been sitting in the back for the whole hour while we were waiting. I ordered Pho Tai (rare steak) and what I received tasted like watery  stock with rubbery over cooked (boiled) steak. I felt committed to eating dinner there after waiting for so long so I tried to eat it, but I just couldn't do it. Not sure what is going on here-- the bar area had been completely cleaned out and they no longer serve alcohol either.  Additionally, the service was terrible. The whole hour we waited someone maybe came by once to check on us and refill our glasses.  I'm disappointed and I always try to lift up local businesses rather than make negative reviews... but felt that with the dramatic change from previous experiences that was necessary to update my previous 5 star review.",

    "text": "Expensive, average food and average service.  This place seems to be busy all the time and does a lot of take out business.  I got the pork and vegetable gyoza.  The menu listed a dollar upcharge for \"pork only.\"  This was confusing to me until I got the plate and realized what was going on.  Pork only meant pork, while pork and vegetable meant 50/50 pork and PLAIN vegetable.  I got the plate and the vegetable ones looked gross and green.  They were also over cooked and had very little filling.  The broth was nothing special.  I liked the amount and variety of vegetables.  Honestly, I don't understand why this place is so popular.  It might be because there is nothing like it in the area.  Prices have to come way down for me to want to visit again.  $40 for a dinner for two with appetizer is crazy expensive, especially when you don't leave satisfied.",

Even worse on the receipt its stated BOILED egg and as the pictures show, the egg is clearly fried. Disappointed to be charged for the wrong thing. Also, the prices on the website are incorrect.
