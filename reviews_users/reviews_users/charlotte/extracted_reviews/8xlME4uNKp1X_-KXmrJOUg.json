    "text": "Very, very disappointed with the quality of food and variety of choices available, especially after waiting for so long for them to open in this location.   I had a split salad and rice bowl with hummus, eggplant etc...  There was no eggplant to be seen or tasted in what they call eggplant side and hummus tasted a lot like yogurt.  Chicken and rice were luke warm. The other add-ons to the bowl were bland too.  The only thing that tasted reasonably well was the lemon tahini dressing and lemonade.  Compared to Yafo (which has a similar \"make your own bowl\" option), Cava has some work to do in coming up with original flavors and ingredients that would make their offerings worth $10 a dish.   I would definitely choose Yafo over Cava when in a mood for a bowl of mediterranean flavors that are well done snd freshly baked pita bread.",

Falafel and beef meatballs were cold. Nothing stood out. Everything in my bowl was just okay. I liked the decor and that they served out of staub cast iron. I won't go again.",

They barely gave us any rice or lentils (I had to ask 2x for more) p.s I am a small girl and don't eat much but the portions they were serving was not worth the price at all. They were out of almost everything ... we had to wait 10 min for chicken, and never ended up getting other ingredients we waited for. Also, the back counter looked super messy and all the ingredients were mixed together. I understand you guys just opened but it's something to really improve for the future. I don't think I'll be back to this location.",

The bowl size was fine, I was full before I finished everything. It would be nice to have more of the dips and on a separate plate. The bowl ended up being a mashup, with some interesting flavors. The beef meatballs had better flavor and texture than the falafel which was too mushy on the inside for me. By the end, salt was the predominant taste and I would probably choose another venue next time. The water spout was out of order on the fountain, so only soda water was available. I opted not to purchase a beverage which didn't help with all of the salt.",

    "text": "I absolutely fell in LOVE with CAVA once it opened up here in Park Road. Almost every experience I have had here is great, and the food is always fresh and prepared. I most often come during the week, and everything is always ready to go and the staff is awesome. However, I came this past weekend, and my experience was terrible. To start, we got there at opening, and there was a line of people (including me) waiting for them to open the doors on time, which they did not. The employees were different than usual, so this made sense to me. Once we got inside, none of the food was prepared. No proteins were ready, no lentils, etc. I ordered the roasted veggies, my favorites, which were not roasted at all and they were cold, hard, and covered in pepper. I knew they weren't prepared correctly as I have had delicious ones multiple times prior. I had my order placed online, and when I opened my bag, there was no dressing. I told the woman working and she seemed to not care one bit. My mom and I got there at 10:45, and the chicken, lentils, and other proteins were not ready until 11:15. If it opens at 10:45, I expected the food to be ready, and at least not sub par. It seems as if they were running behind and threw out whatever they could. I am very disappointed in this experience, as it was significantly worse than usual. I am glad that was not my first time going here, as I probably would have never returned.",

The line was super long but it was about 7pm and a free dinner so a little line was ok. I was overwhelmed with the options and I felt pressured to choose what I wanted . It was all in my head not by the employees. I'm really basic when it comes to food so I don't think I took advantage of all the different options and flavors. Nonetheless, I did enjoy my chicken bowl and the spicy hummus was delicious !!! I did get a few sauces on the side because I was scared to mix it all in and not like it . The mixed veggies had a funny taste so I'm positive I didn't like them. The juices were way too sweet for me so I added water . Overall it was good, just not food I would eat normally .",

There's plenty of vegetarian options, as well as a full list of dietary compatibility for each item right on the menus which is very convenient. They also have a good selection of special juices, teas, and custom sodas. (Blueberry soda anyone? Yes, it's a thing here.) They were super helpful as it was our first time and willing to let us try pretty much any item or sauce we wanted before making our selections. It's a decent price as long as you maximize your bowl with their unlimited toppings. I wish they offered a few \"crafted\" (pre-designed) menu options too (for a change of pace from your norm or for those overwhelmed by too many choices), but all said and done, we were very happy with it and definitely would be happy to return.",

I love the many options ranging from a mini pita to a huge salad, all of which are accented with a plethora of yummy toppings.   The servers, especially Demonte (I believe this is his name), are gracious with giving me and my friends as few or many toppings as we request, along with really great recommendations!   I also love the seasonal part of the menu that changes. It offers different vegetables, such as butternut squash and brussel sprouts offered this winter, which makes Cava vegan, whole30 and keto friendly.   It is interesting to note that the water is all bubbly water, not still. I like this little touch to make the experience even more different/better than normal.   Cava, I will be back!",

It's got some different options than the nearby growing competitors of Yafo, but I found that I prefer the flavors of Yafo as well as the serving size for the similar price of a bowl. The service here is always helpful, but it does get crowded quickly as there aren't much indoor seating spaces during peak times. However, it is fast casual so tables open up pretty quickly.  The drinks/juice options at CAVA were very tasty and not overly sweet!",

So far I have gone with the grain bowls (rice and other bases you can choose from), and a pita wrap.   The bowls are great when you get some pita on the side and make it a dip and bread combo.          Yesterday I did the pita wrap with falafel.   I Threw some cabbage, tomatoes, cucumbers in there,  also I added a couple of hummus flavors and I had the lady who made my pita at the end choose the dressing.  I think it was a lemon one....And boom, amazing.    The people at the park road location had to deal with grand opening crowds and absolutely crushed it.  They gave each person a separate experience and made the time we waited well worth it.  I would choose this place over a YAFO if I wanted a meal any day.   The park road place has plenty of parking and a great plaza to shop in before or afterwards.  If you haven't had a chance to go here yet, Google the address and go already.",

The staff were really helpful and explained how the menu worked and then my friend and I got grain bowls.   Points for roasted red pepper hummus and eggplant and red pepper hummus. Both were delicious!   They offered either a grain or green or 50/50 bowl or pita options. With a bowl they provide you a piece of pita on the side. Then you pick your protein, hummus, toppings and dressing options.   I also opted for a small drink ($2) and tried the apple/cinnamon/vanilla and that was good, but I think they should offer that as a hot cider in the winter. I ended up with the blueberry lavender drink and it was light and refreshing.   They do offer cookies as well as canned/bottle beverages as well.   In addition, they have recycling available and have more sustainable silverware available so bonus points there!",

There were so many options it was hard to decide. This place is great if you are vegan or vegetarian.It is located in the Park Road shopping center which made parking pretty easy. The staff was friendly and very helpful.  I got the greens and grains bowl. There were around 6 or more greens to choose from including arugula, spinach, romaine, spring mix etc. I got the romaine with brown basmati rice, braised lamb, chicken, tzatziki sauce, red pepper hummus, feta cheese, carrot and cranberries  mix(I think that is what it was) topped with yogurt fill sauce. The bowl was full to say the least. It also came with a warm pit and I tried the Raspberry Lemonade mix with the Cucumber Mint Lemonade.  In all everything was delicious.   I've already told my friends  and co-workers about it. There is no doubt that I will be a repeat customer.",

I do appreciate seeing more pay at the counter type places pop up because I want more of these options as it makes quick dinners and takeout much more acceptable, accessible and cheaper especially for singles.  I thought the quality of ingredients here was good not great and the spices used were not my favorite but I prefer Greek over middle eastern so this could be the case even though both styles are similar.  Maybe a bit pricey for what you get but nothing too crazy and you should be full for around $10.  Reasonably healthy if you play it straight.  Nice option In Montford.",

I feel like people have a lot of love for CAVA but the food just underwhelmed me. I will say that the staff were extremely friendly and helpful and the inside is clean and modern. I had a grain bowl with the saffron rice, falafel, hummus, tzatziki, and crazy feta. For toppings I got the cucumber tomato salad, kalamata olives, and onions. The portion for the price overall felt small. There was an OK amount of rice on the bottom but not a lot. The spread portions are also a small scoop, and at similar places/chains the portions of these are much larger. The hummus was OK but it wasn't very flavorful. The falafel were fine but I don't love the style they serve at CAVA. The chick peas are left larger and they feel heavily fried but also weren't crispy, which made them greasy. I was also disappointed in the cucumber and tomato salad because the tomatoes were hardly ripe. They were almost hard to eat. Maybe this was an off experience compared to the norm, but I really prefer Yafo if I'm craving Mediterranean. Their portions are huge and everything is always fresh and in season. I wouldn't run back to CAVA but might consider trying it again in the future.",

The line was long and there was a decent wait. I came on a week night around 7 PM.   I ordered the soup and half pita with beef meatballs. The soup was not good. I returned it and they gave me more meatballs. The balls were good, but very pink in the middle. Are they supposed to be? I didn't mind it too much, but would have preferred them to be more cooked. The lemonade and mint drink were delicious. I highly recommend both.   The staff was super nice. They were helpful and caring. I don't know if I would rush back here, but may stop in again sometime.",

The flavor has to be present, the presentation has to be colorful, and the food needs to remain fresh and savory even though it's fast-casual.  Cava was a little messy when we went in. It was late in the evening and I'm sure they had just come off a dinner rush, but it could have been swept or tidied up a bit.   The service was great. I was excited to try this new spot and had the highest hopes it would hold a candle to similar local fast-casual spots.   My food was good, not great. I didn't leave craving more of anything specific - I'll give it another try because the harissa was very tasty and the falafel was different from the norm!    I'd vote this as a great lunch spot. Or something quick and easy if you're in the park road area.   Pictured here: I built my own bowl with all the veggies possible! Hubby got the pita with grilled chicken.",

They have practically a limitless amount of options for vegans & vegetarians, but also have a great selection of proteins as well. You start by picking your grain or greens then you pick your hummus then your protein, then your toppings/sauce/dressing. Super fast and convenient, I always use the app because it's quick & I can just run in and pick it up & when you spend a certain amount of $$ you get a free meal.  Staff is always great, never had a problem with them. I have to say one thing that cava stands out for is their environmental support and priorities, all the utensils, bowls, and even straws are biodegradable. All their sodas are non-commercial and organic, and all the juices are made in house with real ingredients.",

If you're familiar with the building and the past restaurants that where there (Godfather's Pizza and Fuel) you know there was an upstairs sitting area also. So when I arrived and saw that it was only one level and I was expecting a Super Cava you can imagine my face. The inside however is very nicely decorated. It has a very simple and clean look with black and wood as the main color scheme. The layout makes the tables very accessible and there are tables outside.   I'm in love with the Greens and Grain bowl which is half grain half salad bowl. I always order it to go because I can't finish it. The new seasonal items are amazing. My favorite one is the red pepper chickpea dressing. I normally get the romaine lettuce and the saffron basmati rice. My favorite protein is the lamb meatballs but they are an up charge.   The service is phenomenal. All the employees have been super helpful and very patient especially since I always have like 4 different bowls I'm trying to make at once.   This Cava gets 5 stars from me. I can't wait to see all the seasonal items in store. I see loads of healthy Mediterranean lunches in my future.

Also, despite being so busy staff members still found the time to walk around and make sure people where doing fine and happy with their meals!   This location is pretty easy to find located in park road shopping center. It's middle sized on the inside so during peak times seating may get tough, but not to bad. I went with brown rice and romaine as my base and braised lamb and lamb meatballs as protein. They also have tons of great toppings and sauce options that makes your bowl magical! I'm definitely a fan and will be back soon!",

I got the Apple cinnamon vanilla- tasted like fall! Next time I will try the Greek Mediterranean soup! Sounded so good!   It's good for takeout cause they don't have a huge amount of seating. But then again it's food that's fast. So seats open as fast as they are filled. Don't be fooled by a long line here, it's worth the wait. They are efficient and have a great system!   I love the concept of Cava the fresh healthy Mediterranean option! They have a list of GF/DF and other allergy info. All nutritional value info is posted as well.   Thank you to the staff that worked so hard to provide the fresh food for us. Everything is sourced locally which is also amazing that they give back!",

Today they had the preview meal day and guest had the opportunity to enjoy an assortment of Mediterranean options. You select your green, grains and toppings oh and don't forget the awesome in-house pita chips.   This new CLT cava is located near Firestone and Harris Teeter in the Park Road Shopping Center. The architectural work is great and from the outside it looks as if it's two levels but it's not.  What I love the most about Cava is the way they give back to the community. During community day they offer free dinner to the community in exchange for donations that will benefit a local farming non profit. All proceeds raised will be donated to Sow Much Good!  Check out Cava you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "We tried to come here the day before they opened when they were giving away free meals, but the love was wrapped around the building. We came back for a team lunch a few days later.   We didn't get there until about 12:30 and it was crowded. The love moved fast, but the restaurant is not made for a lot of people. It's very loud and there isn't very much seating. We had a group of 7 and we were able to find a table, but we had to split up. You also can't move the tables, so the largest group that can sit together is 4.   As for the food -- it's a build your own Mediterranean style restaurant (think Chipotle). It's similar to Yafo. There are no suggested options.   You can get a bowl or pita and do a salad or grain base. I did a salad base with SplendidGreens. It was a mix of kale and Brussels sprouts (and something else I can't remember). You get one protein -- I picked spicy lamb meatballs (there's an upcharge)  You get three sauces and I got roasted red pepper hummus, harissa, and crazy feta. You get as many toppings as you want and I got all except olives and lettuce (and they were out of the seasonal veggies). You then finish with one dressing and I got lemon herb tahini. They also gave me pita with my bowl.   Overall, I really liked it. The lamb meatballs were delicious, but I wish they gave you more than 4 small meatballs. I probably wouldn't get harissa again because while it was good, the spice overtook the flavor of the whole bowl. I loved the SplendidGreens base. Much more unique than your normal salad base.   The drink options are really good. They make their own sodas, but I went for the lemonades. I mixed the cucumber lime mint with the classic lemonade.   Overall, I think I like Yafo better, but it's definitely close. I think Cava has better choices for your base.   I really enjoyed my meal and I would come back again, but either with a smaller group or I would get it to go.",

Like everyone says, it's like the Greek version of Chipotle with way more options. My bowl was delicious. I really loved the feta dip and wish I had gotten 3 scoops of that instead of the red pepper eggplant and roasted red pepper dip. The bowl was filling. Also, their drinks were good. The staff were very friendly and parking at that time was no problem.   I would go again. The only thing that would keep me from going every day is the price. :-)",

The people that work at this location are always friendly and ingredients are always fresh.   My order is fairly consist, I always get the super greens (a mix of kale and shaved brussel sprouts), lentils, and brown rice. At this point they also ask you if you want a warm mini pita (I'm gluten free ... but if you aren't... they are good). Then you add on three dips: hummus, eggplant and red pepper, and tzatziki. Then you choose your protein I used to always get falafel, but sadly they are binded with a gluten so I've switched to the seasonal roasted veggies. Then you get to add all the toppings: I get extra red cabbage, tomatoes and cucumber, kalamata olives, and feta.  I crave this all. the. time. I'm there pretty regularly!   Try their custom drink combos! They are delish!",

Perfect bowl consists of:  1/2 super greens 1/2 lentils Spicy lamb meatballs Spicy harissa Roasted red pepper hummus Tzaziki Feta Pickled onions Cucumber and tomatoes Cabbage slaw Banana peppers Pearl couscous Cauliflower quinoa tabbouleh (missing in my bowl) Fresh mint (also think this was missing) Crispy pita strips   Green harissa and sriracha yogurt on the side. Only complaint is it's a pretty light bowl. Could probably load you up more on the base or toppings. Also, online ordering seems to not be completely accurate. My order through the app is slightly different from what was printed on the receipt/order.",

    "text": "So I came to this location for their grand opening and it was great but that is to be expected with everyone being new and corporate being there. Since then I've been back 3 times, two of the times were meh just due to lack of friendliness and it being more of a get in get out experience. This last time on Sunday made this my last time coming to this location, I will just go to the University location when I'm on that side even though this is closer to me.   On Sunday upon walking in I was greeted this time by a worker wiping down tables. I went to the counter to start my order, the employee for the line was chatting with the cashier and slowing came over. I started my order and when I got to protein I asked to verify if I got half braised lamb & half lamb meatballs would u be charged $1.45 twice. He started no. I also remember someone asking the day of the opening but just wanted to me sure I usually just get one of them but wanted both this time. When I got to the register the cashier wasn't they so he rang me up. When I seen my receipt I seen I was charged twice & asked about it. He responded oh guess I was wrong, the cashier was walking back up & he asked her & she said yep that's how it's charged. They said they would get a manger after going back & forth but I was in a rush. When I got in the car I decided to call & asked for the manager, when she got in the phone she talked fast with an attitude that I couldn't get her name. I proceed to say hello like 6 times because the phone got silent (I'm assuming she muted the phone to talk to the employees). She got back on the phone and said hello again very rudely. At this point I'm over it so I just ask about the charge and she responded yep that's how it's rung up and then proceed to hang up.  So I decided to call the university location and they confirmed it should be only one charge. And I also tried it online and you only get charged once as well.  Either they like overcharging customers or they don't own up to simple mistakes either way they won't get my money again.",
