I had the Baja fish tacos and it was hard to eat because they were soggy and fell apart trying to pick them up. Flavor was pretty bland as well. The worst part was that the service was non-existent. Waiter showed up, took our order, delivered the food and we never saw him again. Finally went to hostess and complained and they sent someone else out to serve us saying he was sick and was now in the back rolling silverware which is exactly what you want a sick person doing. I won't be back again",

It was a pretty large party but they pulled one tables together and we had two waitresses ready to take our drink orders! We ordered a little bit of everything beer, wine, margaritas and of course shots! And everyone's drinks came out quickly...which surprised me because this placed was super packed!!! I guess it's too be expected since this place seemed like the perfect go to spot for game day tons of TVs everywhere with different games on each one!   We ordered some appetizers wings, chips and salsa and cheese sticks all pretty standard but very good.   For our meals we had a little bit of everything...just a few things I remember from our table were the chicken tenders, burgers, sandwiches and crab cakes...and they all looked super delicious! I went with the Smothered Chicken which was a chicken breast, Mushrooms & Onions Sauteed with white Wine Garlic Butter, Jack Cheese and for the sides I chose a loaded baked potato and side salad. It came out HOT!! I really enjoyed the chicken, it was very tender and moist! I would recommend it!   We all left stuffed and happy....it was a good visit... Totally recommend this place and look forward to returning.",

All the bartenders new your name, had your drink ready for you, just a good place to go. After Dan the GM, left it started to go down hill a little. Slowly but surely it has gotten worse.  Way over priced, service is awful, and the food is just so so.  The staff make you feel like you are bothering them, if you ask for something.  Only real good thing about Hickory is the TVs. Lots of them. It's just too corporate for me now.",

    "text": "I was asked to organize an informal dinner gathering for our office, and decided to go with Hickory Tavern. We had between 25 - 30 people RSVP so, I wanted to make sure to choose a place that served something for everyone.  The menu is good in this respect - plenty of appetizer options, salads, sandwiches, and all sorts of entrees.   They pulled several tables together for our group, and the only downside was that the tables were all in a line so it was a bit tough to socialize with folks at the other end of the table. I am not sure how to best configure the tables,  but I didn't really like the way it was set up.    The only other problem was that we had 2 servers assigned to our table, but we still found the service to be a little hit or miss.  I expected a much higher level of service for a \"corporate outing\" where we were ordering plenty of drinks, apps, and dinner.  The other disappointing thing is that we had our event on a Thursday night, so there was some sort of ladies night event going on.  This would not be a problem, except there was an abnormal amount of bar noise and constant annnouncements over a PA system.  This wasn't very conducive to conversation at the table.  I would consider giving them another shot for a future outing, but I would definitely avoid the ladies night and would want to check out how to better set up the tables for a group event.",

Must order those! Chicken sandwich was just meh - chicken was very chewy in the middle and kind of turned me off from eating it. French dip sandwich was VERY good and good quality roast beef. The price for a side salad is a little much ($6.29) for what it is, but at least it comes with a tasty pastry. All in all its a solid restaurant for watching games with a nice, big feel and many big screens.",

We were most excited to see Hickory Tavern in Ballantyne had two outdoor patios - one was empty, we assume that it was perhaps the non-smoking patio. Our waitress, Kelsi (sp?) was right on the ball and a lovely person. The food we ordered (one quesadilla appetizer & one smothered chicken) was quite delicious and the substantial leftovers were dinner the next evening. The manager came out to say hello as well as they prepared for a big \"game night\" crowd. A very nice quiet and casual dining experience (it would not have been that way inside which was hopping, music blasting).  We enjoyed our dining experience and will be back.",

Still a decent time but I sucked and rode my team's coat tails. The establishment is huge and clean. There were several servers tending to our large party so getting drinks was not a problem. $4 tall Blue Moons isn't too shabby either.  Only thing I can hold against this place is that its more of a family restaurant than a tavern. The actual bar is pretty small compared to the size of the place and the sound system was close to being inaudible.",

Over two decades in the food service industry (chef/cook) so I am very observant. Not that it makes me more important then any one else, just wanted to point that out for later comments. I've come to this particular hickory tavern many times.  So like I said, no solar viewing glasses as advertised the day before via email ( boo to the advertising staff) but I had my own pin hole viewer, not a big deal to me ( yes now the staff involved knows who I am. Good.) some of the staff had their own glasses, purchased by them. They shared them freely to the guests.  The manager, bartender, servers. All of them, knowing people would be disappointed and pissy, had a great attitude. Awesome considering.  There was also a group of corporate types there. Yes I saw you, know your kind, polo shirts and acting like your better then someone paying without a corporate credit card, taking all the service teams time, looking at me like i'm a fungus ( yeah, me in the chef coat) Guess you never worked in a food service. Any who. Even with them service was stellar.  Though I didn't eat on this particular visit I'm sure it would of been great. Just like every other time I've been there. Just like the service.   One last note: to the lady who walked in at the eclipse pinnacle and cried about service and how you don't care about seeing it, that you were just hungry . Yeah. Saw you take that little girl out to see it. Cared then didn't you. Your entitled ego can just stay at home and not harass hard working people. Words cannot amount to the loathing I feel about people like you.",

It's your average sports bar and grill: burgers, chips & queso, tacos, sandwiches, etc.  They do have local brews, which was cool for us out of towners to try. And when I say \"us,\" I really  mean my brother, boyfriend, and other cousins. Me? I don't drink beer. Pretty cool spot to watch a game... or attend trivia on Tuesday nights!

My friend loved them, but I was disappointed because they were fried and I expected steamed which I like better.  We also shared an order of crab dip which was mediocre, and there wasn't enough pitas for the dip, which always seems to be the case.  We ordered Seafood Bayou - which was Blackened Tilapia & Shrimp over Tavern Rice with Cajun Alfredo, Tomatoes, Scallions & One Side.  My friend loved it, I just thought it was edible.  The fish didn't taste fresh, so I'm sure its just frozen, and the blackened seasoning tasted more like jerk to me. The rice tasted like one of those rice mixes you get at the grocery store.  The 3rd party got a quesadilla which was rare for her because all she eats is burgers and fries, she seemed to enjoy it.  I would try it again, but not for seafood, maybe for wings or one of the salads.",

I have had mediocre to abysmal experiences at every other location I have dined at (5+ other locations).  However this location always seems to get the job down.  They have recently revamped their menu and offer a decent selection and quality of food. As this place is primarily a sports bar the TV setup is always important, and they do an optimal job of providing ample TV's facing in easy to see locations. They also have a good projector setup in the dining area.  I would personally recommend the nachos, they serve you heapings of it that is impossible to finish alone.",

The pros include the people (meaning a fantastic crowd on most nights), the food has always been good (wings, burgers, quesadilla, nachos, sliders, etc.), a great selection of beers, and a ton of tv's to catch the game from every seat.  The cons include a little of the decore issue William mentioned.  Yes, it's a little predictable.  Also, it's not the cheapest bar you'll find.  Basically though, we don't go to bars/restaurants to enjoy the decor on the walls.  They're not trying to be some quaint joint that attracts a specific eclectic demographic.  This is a large suburban bar who attracts a broader spectrum of customer.  They do it right.  We go for the gathering of old friends and to meet new friends.  We also go to eat, drink and catch a game.  Regarding the prices, if you don't want to spend $4 for a beer, there are many other places in South Charlotte, but you won't get what you get here.  I've actually frequented their location on Providence Rd. many times as well.  Neighter location calls themself a sports bar, but they're the best sports bar near where I live.  In summary, I recommend it as a casual hangout with friends to eat, drink and catch a game.",

She just wanted the chicken, but when she got the cooked through version it was rubbery and salt soaked.  Worse part was the bill.  I was shocked to see not only were we charged for the chicken, but we were also charged over 7 dollars for 2 helpings of bread.  The bread was great, but not $7+ great. I've never been charged for bread. I was okay with a charge of a buck or two, but $7?  For the priceof the total meal we could have sat down at a good local restaurant and gotten much better food.",

I've noticed probably about  two months or so ago they changed their menu a little bit and added the \"build your own salad\" concept. I love it! The salad options are out of this world and it arrives in a perfect portion tin bowl (to keep it cold). The salad is chopped all together with the dressing mixed in. The options are amazing because you are able to create so many different varieties of salads. Other than their salad options, I have eaten their burgers, chicken sandwiches, and wings. I have never had any issue with their food and for a bar type atmosphere, differently recommended. They have more T.V's than any bar I have ever been too, so watching a game is never a problem. One problem is the service. We always tend to sit at the bar because the servers take forever to come by the tables. Other than that, I love it! I'm about to move to Orlando and I will miss my Hickory Tavern food!",

Geeessshh.  50 cents more for 6 wings.  $1 more for 12 wings.  The grilled wings are good and I can't say they are worth the up charge but until I find another place in town that will actually grill them then looks like we're stuck.   Got acquainted with the place due to a Yelp event. But forgot they are right at Midtown so that'll be our go to location.   They offered daily specials even a Pimento sandwich and chips deal for $3 during the Masters. I'm not into mayo based cheese but I will say I love that everyone around here knows it it a big deal and offers it.",

Great experience from the managers, to the food, the drinks and best of all the servers!!!! Love love love Justyne and had the pleasure of meeting Alison tonight!! They're both amazing!!!!!!!! I've been here every Friday since August of 2015!!! :)  Updated review above:  I usually update my reviews when I'm taking back a star but tonight is an exception.   I want to thank Justyne for taking such good care of us!!!! My friends and I are regulars and some of the servers have waited on us several times..no big deal.  Justyne served us a few weeks ago and she not only remembered us but remembered our beer!!! She's on point with customer service and we will request to sit at her section the next time we're there!!!!!  Original review is below:  We always have a great time here!!! Meet some friends for dinner and drinks!! Order the Chicken Colorado!! It was delicious - grilled chicken breast with a bit of bbq sauce, bacon and melted cheese.. I know it sounds busy but it's so good.  The whole table ordered the same dish. Lol Not to mention - I had my favorite beer in the world.  Red Oak Hummingbird!!!  Good times!!!",

We were greater and seated promptly.  There were more than enough TV's with several sporting events.  The food was great.  My kids loved their naked wings.  My wife's blackened shrimp tacos were excellent.  My Korean BBQ tenders were amazing.  I liked the sauce which had just the right amount of spice.  Next time I will get the sauce on the side to avoid the breading getting soggy at the end, though it was still really good.  The highlights for me were the food truck tater tots and the service.  Our server was friendly, prompt, and responsive.  It made for a great family dinner at the Hickory Tavern.",

    "text": "So I've been here enough to be crowned \"The Duke\" on my handy dandy Yelp app.  I like it here because it's an affordable place for me to take my kids and get a decent meal.  Let's face it, it's not the Capital Grille and I know what I'm getting when I go.  Apparently they're doing well since I see they're now building a new location closer to my house.  I've figured out that I really like their burgers.  Hickory Honey Burger seems to be my favorite.  I like to order it with one of their awesome side salads (for an additional $2.50 upcharge) which is worth every penny IMO.  The only problem is that they absolutely, positively cannot manage their ticket times well enough that I can enjoy my salad.  It comes out and within 2 minutes I get my burger.  PEOPLE THIS ISN'T RIGHT!!!  Now I'm forced to rush through my salad, which I really enjoy, so I don't have a cold burger waiting for me on the backend.   I explained this to both waitresses who didn't seem to understand what I was talking about or why I was unhappy.  Perhaps it was my sarcastic tone, I don't know.  Last night she took my burger back and set it under the heatlamp until I was ready, now I have a crappy burger.    Next time I will bring a timeline on how shit should be served and hand it to the waitress so I don't walk out with a case of heartburn from rushing through my meal.",

The Only thing i liked was the humus and it was very tasty. The sweet tea was way too sweet and I had to order an unsweet tea to mix with it. The smokehouse burger had a bad after taste like it was fried in old grease. The burger was about $12.00 and doesn't compare to local burger places that easily put this to shame. The service started friendly but took extremely long times to get the food (20 minutes) after appetizer and over 10 minutes to bring the check. So, I would say if you like to drink beer, this place may be great. However, for food, I would recommend something different.",

It was cooked perfectly on Cedar. I ordered it medium well and it was the correct temperature. The Broccoli and Asparagus tasted fresh and were lightly seasoned. Even though I ordered the Shrimp substituting the rice for Sprouts without Bacon, they gave me rice anyway. They also up charged me which I wasn't made aware of when I ordered, so that was annoying. Especially since the rice is the same price as the sprouts on the menu. So the up charge made no sense. The shrimp were overcooked and the rice didn't add much to it. But their grilled Brussel Sprouts are awesome. The Gumbo was also delicious. Nice and chunky! I'm excited to keep trying dishes here",

Big mistake.  The service was amazing.  The food was awful.  I'm not really sure what they did to my husband's tater tots?  The manager thought they had been dropped in the fryer twice.  GROSS!  They were petrified, cold and dripping with grease.  It was the strangest thing I've seen off of a bar menu.  My sandwich was wrong.  Basically the poor woman that brought her A-game as a server kept apologizing for the kitchen.  I will not be returning to any Hickory Tavern.  It's too unpredictable.  I'm not a fan of playing Russian Roulette with food and service.",

The food is inconsistent but it's definitely edible. We've been on some days when the fries come out ice cold while others days, they're so hot they're still dripping in oil. The Food Truck menu is pretty tasty but they've culled it down a bit. Don't bother with dessert - just order an extra cocktail instead. This is a great option for kids meals though (see earlier mention of questionable kid friendly spot on game days).",

I will highlight a few of the ones that are my favorites and some I don't recommend!  Chicken Quesadilla 5/5- Comes with a jalapenos, sour cream, etc. to add into the quesadilla if you want! Charred Plain Jane wings 5/5- AMAZING. They are such a hit with anyone I've ever gone here with Lobster Roll- 5/5 My Go-to item... I swear its the best one in town. You wouldn't expect it either. The bread is tasty and the price can't be beat Crab dip- 3/5 Average Sliders- 3/5 Tavern Potato Chips- 5/5 the sauce is addicting! Chips and Queso- 3/5 Black and Blue Burger- 5/5 Chicken Colorado-5/5 Tavern Salad-5/5  The service has been solid at all of the locations I have gone to. Most of the time, it has been excellent! It has always been excellent here!",

    "text": "Local craft beer? Check. Daily food specials, including an oyster day? Check. Good bar food? Check. Lunch menu? Check. Dog friendly patio? Check.  Dozens of TVs and crazy large pulldown screen for football? CHECK.  This is one of my favorite Hickory Tavern locations. Its on my side of town, the food is always on point, and you can get good beer, fast. Is it pricier than my average neighborhood go-to? Yes. But! Don't fret, my pet - They have NC specials once a week, bringing your local favorites to $3.50 and I think there's a night or two where all drafts are cheaper. They have a TON of taps and a full bar, something for everyone and you can tell that the favorites stick around. I've been here a few times on oyster night - oysters on the half shell are .75 cents each and shrimp are .50 cents each - order any amount you like! They'll bring over all of the plates, little forks, crackers, hot sauce, etc.   One of the two patios has those roll up garage doors for the fall and spring - let's be honest, no one wants to roll those up in the summer. Darn NC blazing hot summers....   This is a huge place, you can usually find me in the bar area - I know, you're really surprised by this. They also have a more family friendly, sit down booth area. They buy the expensive sports package, so you can come here to watch football, or a UFC fight - they show just about every big sports event.  Hickory is a chain, but a good option when you're not looking to go too far out of the Sports Bar box.",

They set up the restaurant perfectly for our group. We were sat immediately. The servers were attentive and got started on our orders right away! Our drinks, appetizers, and meals were out in a flash!  I ordered the create your own salad which I SCARFED down due to it being so AWESOME!

I usually go to the one in Steele Creek but happened to be in this area today. I had the kids today so we sat at a table in the back. The server was very friendly and nice. I did like they had a few games at this location especially this bowling game up front was really fun for the kids and I really enjoyed it as well. I ordered the blackened grouper sandwich was very good although it came with remoulade sauce instead of tarter which was a bit different. My hubs ordered a bacon burger he did not read what was on it and it came with man n cheese on top of the burger a bit different, so make sure you read what's on the burgers as they have a vast array of interesting additions. The wings are always great here as well(try the teriyaki). They have a small or big draft beer to choice from too. Its a great place to go to watch a game, date night, kid night or just I need a break from life by yourself night.",

She said I could look around to find my family. Once I found them I sat down and our server immediately came over to ask what I would like to drink. My usual... water...  She gave us plenty of time to review the menu... my mom takes FOREVER! And she always check backed in which I like. The appetizer came out that my parents ordered. It was the onion ring tower, I liked the spicy sauce that came with it. Every year I receive birthday coupons from hickory tavern and I wasn't sure if I had received mine yet. I asked the server if they had a away of checking the system which she didn't. They only know by emails. After throughly checking my emails I mentioned mine hadn't arrived yet, probably because my birthday is the last day of the month lol. Which was fine, but she politely whispered it's ok, I'll bring you a birthday dessert! Beaming I was so excited and thanked her.  Our food came out and I have the philly cheese which was LOADES with lots of steak and two beautiful cut tomatoes and lettuce with my side of tots. My dad ordered the chicken salad sandwich which looked delicious, so delicious he didn't share.  My mom stepped out her box and ordered a poboy which she liked and didn't share.   After dinner our server brought out a very warm and fudge filled brownie. It was soooo good I loved all three bites!",

    "text": "This is my first time visiting this place. This is the second sports bar that I had visited over the years after visiting one in Ohio. We went as a group from the company, our group count goes to 10 people. They had long surf board table that can fit more than 10+ people and u have got screens all around running games, news and some funny videos channel. They have also got a big projector to be used during the game season  With regards to the service our waiters were helpful and prompt. But with regards to the service time of getting the food order from u and actually delivering the food, I can say their time is close to 6 on the scale of 10. I guess it depends on the people in the group and their order. But overall the bar was not much crowded, I can say it was an average crowding. I guess if u go as a small group their service would be faster i guess.  Now the food. I ordered the Oregon cedar salmon. I have never tasted it anywhere so I wasn't in any expectation. The presentation was top notch and the taste of the salmon was really good. Overall the whole plate was really fulfilling. The sweet potato fries is another thing it was quite different and I liked it. Awesome job guys  One recommendation is that the service times can be improved.",

Compared to the Wesley Chapel and Providence road locations - the Ballantyne location felt clean, and the food not only looked better, but tasted good.  I had not had, nor thought about even trying the Calamari from Hickory Tavern, but it was surprisingly good!  Crisp with a sweet and spicy sauce.    The Cabbage Salad tastes exactly like a kid would imagine - horrible, bitter, and not a good texture.  Barf!  Overall it was good visit - prices are a little up there, and I wish the burgers were made-to-order, but this location was well run and clean - something I feel is drifting from the other Hickory Tavern Locations!",

My favorite thing on that menu is their BBQ chicken nachos.  They are def I'm my top ten food favorites of all time . (And trust me I like to eat) I attached a picture of the deliciousness.  We also had the crab dip that was bomb as well. It didn't come with enough pita squares but the dip itself was amazing and I had no problem polishing off the end with just a spoon. It has a panko crust on top which made it perfect with a little crunch. Service was great. They had lots of open tables but when we asked for one they said they were all full and we had to sit in the bar area. Not a big deal but we were looking to sit somewhere a little quieter for chatting.  They had beer specials that were such a good deal it was cheaper to buy the 22 oz than the 16 oz.  They also have a shot special for $5. Can't remember what was in it but apparently they have this special all the time. The manager even stopped by to check on us. We will be back.",

When I walk in the hostess opened the door to greet me then made casual conversation on the way to the table.  The hostess said they got a new menu about a month ago and my heart sunk, thinking they wouldn't have what I wanted.  (The website still has the old menu posted.). The hostess pointed out many new menu items, all of which sounded great!  I stuck to my favorite item to satisfy that craving I had been having, crab dip.  I also decided to get a fish sandwich.  The crab dip was excellent, as usual.  The fish sandwich was flaky and flavorful.  I tried to eat it sandwich-style, but it was too messy.  I think if the fish were available as fried, it would hold up better.  I ate the fish with a fork.  Service was great.  My server kept the water full and timed food arrival perfectly.  A manager stopped at my table to see how I was doing, and was also seen around the restaurant directing employees like a manager should.",

They make sure we have everything we needed and Nicole (manager) would make sure we are served well when she is working.  Don't complain about petty stuff because it's not easy being a waitress/waiters @ the most busiest bar in this shopping center.  This is a high end Hickory Tavern bar and they do make ends meet for their customers.   Make sure to tip them well if you are going out because they all have families & babies!   They have the number 1 home made fried chips & you dip it in mexi-ranch.  They have the best burgers besides (Matthews Fuddruckers which is shut down), buy one get 1 free burger on Monday night and this is the place to watch all your games.  You can ask the manager to change the channel at your request and when it is not busy.   Y'all make sure to try the fried groupers appetizers, fried groupers taco with the spicy Thai chili is da bomb. They also have the most delicious ribs added to their menu as well. Don't forget the steak!   Pictures will be posted later.",

We hadn't eaten all day and went with the small nachos to start. Huge portion for $6! Highly recommended! My husband and I both got the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and it was terrific. He then got an order of wings \"to go\" to have at the hotel later that night... Which he said were very good as well!  Service was friendly and fast!  We walked the plaza area after eating to help the food digest before heading back to the hotel.   We had a great night! Would definitely return!",

We enjoy the outside area as well.   Tonight the outside was full and the inside had few people in it...because they have added a vocalist with an amplifier.  It was 5:30, but we couldn't talk about our week or make plans for the week-end because we couldn't hear.   I asked the waitress if she could have the amp turned down.  Didn't happen.  The manager couldn't hear me when we were talking.  His suggestion was that we sit elsewhere.  My suggestion is that you lose the vocalist or turn down the amp.   Be back?   Not until we know we can talk.  My ears are still ringing.  It was that loud.",

The fiesta salad has BBQ chicken, corn, black beans, romaine, and mexi-ranch dressing. The flavors were all great, but the chopped chicken pieces were awkwardly large as a bite, and the chicken::BBQ ratio wasn't quite right. Smaller pieces please!

    "text": "If you have been to a Hickory Tavern then basically you know what you are getting at any location.  Management does a great job keeping things consistent from location to location.  One positive that I can say about this location, though, is service is a noticeable priority.  I have never had a bad server at this location which I can't always say about other locations.   Essentially this place is fancy bar food, a little pricier than avg. but food is always good.  Buffalo chicken tacos are my go to and are some of the best I've had.  Burgers are also good.  I could run through entire menu but its all pretty good.  During football season this is our family meet up viewing spot and between all of us I'm not sure we have ever had something we didn't like.  Also, my wife's family being from KC it is hard to always find Chiefs game on TV, but they always have the Sunday ticket and every game is on multiple TVs.  Its a great place to watch a game, they did come in 2nd place in a national contest for best sports bar in america, and on Sundays the crowd is huge and a very random variety of fans makes the atmosphere fun.  Moreover, fear not, there are not to many overly annoying redskins, steelers, or cowboy fans.  Some are always there but never as obnoxious as they are when in large numbers.   Usually have a decent drink special, I do wish there was a slightly bigger emphasis on local beers considering the Charlotte craft beer explosion taking place, but you can always find one or two. No real complaints, great place, great location.  If only it was a little closer I'd probably venture here more regularly as opposed to just Sundays.",

I cant out the \"presentation\" part aside as this is comfort food.. but it was presented nicely... BUT the customer service, and the taste of the food really won it for me.. I had a chicken sandwich with fries..doesnt sound too elaborate, but it was awesome!! I ordered.. the meal came like 15 minutes.. and all of the food was hot at the same time! thats a big deal for me.. i cannot tell you how many spots i go to and order, the sandwich comes out hot, but fries/side dish is ...warm..that incredibly saddening.. but NOT HERE..and the drinks were on point!! one of their bartenders..arrggghh!! i cannot remember his his name, but I can say, i believe  he is of Asian decent.. he was super cool, and incredibly professional..overall I give this place 5 stars.. I live in paw creek... so this is not around the corner..but this is one of my new favorite places... if your looking for a very kool, spot for sporting events.. you will NOT regret!",

However, I dunno what happened with William's experience but BOY, was it tasty!!! I went with family and ordered the Mushroom/Onion/Swiss burger, Hickory Honey burger, and Chicken quesadilla. All were fantastic and full of flavor! The burger (M.O.S.) was the winner with a full, robust, mini-cake sized beef patty and the most gooey Swiss that melts in your mouth. Yes sir, that is tasty. Oh, and the fries were a meal alone. They were thick, rustic cuts of potato the size of fingers(yes, fingers. I measured) with light seasoning. Again, yes sir! THAT'S TASTY!  Umm please note that my family members ordered the other stuff. I'm not a professional eater. But if I was, I would come here for training.",

    "text": "My wife and I were meeting a friend's family for dinner to celebrate an occasion.  I ordered a half dozen steamed oysters and a half pound of steamed shrimp as my meal.  The shrimp came out way too early, long before any of the other orders.  The shrimp were grossly undercooked, and the shells were still quite attached to the meat.  As I attempted to peel the 2nd shrimp I got halfway and decided to leave it and ask for a re-order.  The shrimp I attempted to peel had lost its tail and was pretty mangled from my peel try.  When the plate came back, I noticed that it was the exact same order I sent back, mangled tailless shrimp included.  I then asked to speak to a mgr., who was apologetic and promised a new order that he would personally observe being prepared.  I explained to him that a properly cooked shrimp should slip easily from it's shell, which neither order so far had.  He profusely apologized and offered a 3rd order at no charge.  I also explained to him that a good chef should be aware of the 'doneness' of the foods he serves.  He said that they cook by use of timers, and he would review with his staff their procedures.  I replied that a real cook must often test dishes for degree of doneness  by testing; much like throwing a spaghetti noodle against a wall to see if it sticks.  When they arrived (by now I was neither hungry nor in the mood and everyone else had long since finished their meals) they were only slightly more done than the first 2 orders.  I pushed the plate away and we continued our conversations until we parted ways.  Never.  Again, Hickory Tavern.  Worst.  Shrimp.  EVER.",

Eventually ordered two chardonnays to try and get a slight buzz as the four previous vodka cocktails provided none.

My most recent visit was a late night one where I just wanted a good meal and not too much fuss.  The waitress we had was almost happy to see us and that in and of itself was pretty amazing because I know if I was working into the wee hours like that I'm not sure I would have had the same perkiness.  Oh well, she was happy to oblige with our orders and the chicken sandwich I ordered came out perfectly cooked and was devoured!",

    "text": "We used to go to the store in Providence, which was always pretty good, and if it wasn't they'd fix it. How to grab meal tonight at the location on Johnston Road. We ordered off the \"food truck\" menu, simple chicken with rice dish. It tasted like it was cooked last Sunday - chicken was dry and the rice was old. We asked for the sauces to be on the side but both came with one of them on the dish. I was hungry so I ate mine, but my friend sent hers back. Having tasted how dry and tired the meal was I figured my friend would look out by having hers cooked fresh, but I was wrong. She waded in with a few bites and then send it back; the manager came over and asked how the meals were and we told him and he did nothing. I couldn't be bothered to complain. But they have to fewer customers. OK place for a drink but they really Ought be embarrassed at the quality of the food they send out. The manager said chicken with rice was one of their most popular dishes.",
