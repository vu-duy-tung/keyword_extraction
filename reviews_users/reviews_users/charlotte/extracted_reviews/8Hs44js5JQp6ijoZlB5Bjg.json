    "text": "I was disappointed in this place for a multitude of reasons.  I ordered the regular sized bacon cheeseburger with some toppings and fries.  When they brought the burger, there were no fries with it, and it was missing a topping.  I couldn't get anyone's attention, so I took it to the counter and asked for the topping.  The cheese was melted almost all the way off too (they must have put it on too early.  Then I waited and waited, until finally I asked my waitress to please bring the food.  It doesn't take that long to put a topping on.  Then the other waitress that brought the food gave it to me and said sorry she brought it to the wrong table.  By this time I was so hungry, I didn't even care if some had picked up the bun at the other table to see if it was theirs, so I ate it.  I still feel like that was so wrong not to bring me a new one, but honestly, I think it would have taken another 30 min.  Burger and bun was very average and not warm.  The fries were nothing special.  Very average food, HORRIBLE service (even though they were nice).  I will never go back.  They didn't even offer a discount for all the things they screwed up.  The Oreo shake however was delicious.  Hard to mess up an Oreo shake.",

    "text": "Just got a burger, fries, drink combo to go from here. The place was packed at 2pm on a Sunday, so you'd think it must be great. The place just opened very recently, so I think maybe all of these people might have been trying it out for the first time, like I was? I dunno. What I do know is that I won't go back there. A one-word review would simply be: flavorless. The burger had almost no flavor at all, except for the bacon, which I had to take off of the burger after one bite. They use a super smokey bacon that is very over-whelming. Not to mention, I'm pretty sure the bacon is pre-cooked and sitting in a pan on the flat-top for a few hours before you order it. Some of it was hard as a rock and some was greasy and transparent. Yuk. I couldn't eat it. The burger patty wasn't seasoned at all. Not even a pinch of salt and pepper. Probably the most bland burger I've ever had. After I took the bacon off, the only thing that added flavor was the onion, barely. They dice their onions, which I believe is burger-blasphemy. Burger onions should be sliced, not diced. But, hey, that's just like, my opinion, man. Their fries were not good, either. Again, flavorless. How can fries be flavorless, you ask? Well, for starters, they didn't have a grain of salt on them. Whatever oil they fry them in added no flavor, as well. They were also fragile. Wait, what? Fragile? WTF does that mean? It means when you pick a large one up, the heavier end of it kinda snaps in half. Weird, right? Very. I got a sweet tea with my order. Huge mistake, because it gave me diabetes. Okay, that's not exactly True, but I feel like I could have gone into diabetic ketoacidosis had I finished it. It could have been a mistake and someone sweetened it twice, but I've worked in restaurants before and that's amateur-hour stuff, if you ask me. Very disappointed.",

    "text": "Tried this place for the first time today. Pimento cheeseburger was good. Fries are really bland. Also got a brownie sundae which is more than enough to share. Our server was a little obnoxious. She checked on our table every 5 minutes. She made us place our ice cream order before we were even close to finishing our burger and brought out the sundae immediately. So our ice cream was melting all over while we were rushing to eat the rest of our burger. Then she asked if we'd like our check together or separate before we had even tasted the sundae. We felt like we were being rushed the entire meal and practically pushed out the door.  And it wasn't busy at all! I don't want to say the servers name because I can tell that these are all young servers probably still learning. But I'm hoping management will talk to them about how to make their guests feel more welcome, and how off-putting it is to be rushed through a meal. I know this is a casual place but it is bad service to interrupt your guests every couple minutes to see if they are done.",

    "text": "I need to explain the 3 stars. Going to the Hwy 55 has been a mixed bag. I've had some excellent experiences, some mediocre ones and a couple terrible ones. In fairness, that averages out to 3 stars.  You might ask why I keep going back if I've had bad experiences (or you just might not care:)), but the reason is the food has been consistently good each time. Unlike my experiences at another local Fort Mill hamburger place, Hobo's where the food has been inconsistent and the service terrible on each visit, Hwy 55 cranks out a good product time and again. My personal favorite is the pimento bacon cheeseburger, but in reality, all the burgers have been great and part of that is the way they season them - there is a peppery tang to the meat.  The service has been mixed. Look - the place employs a lot of high schoolers, so you aren't going to get the white napkin treatment, nor should you expect it. And in my visits, the waitstaff really seems to be trying to do their best. It looks like the biggest pitfall is the lack of experience. Not knowing how to handle a situation or not knowing what to do when things go South. there isn't the experience to know how to smooth over a bad situation. Again, I understand it and that's why I also keep going back.   The appearance of the restaurant is hit or miss. I've gone where everything is orderly and other times, it looks like a tornado came through with litter all over the floor and ketchup splatters streaking tables. Most the time I've gone, the place is really busy, so I understand sweeping isn't the first thing on their mind.   Here's what I've noticed. When it has been a small table of 2, things have gone pretty flawless. When it has been a table of 4, little things have popped up - forgotten bacon on a burger or not remembering to bring out a side of fries until prompted. Where the wheels fall of is when any table larger than 4 sits down. Again, not a huge surprise given the lack of experience the servers have, but management needs to see that and compensate by employing food runners or the like. The worst experience I had was when I came in with my family of 4 and my parents, which made a table of 6. Three of us got our meals in a reasonable time and they were tasty. Then the waitress told us one of the burgers was dropped and they needed to re-fire it. Great, but then what happened to the other 2 missing meals? 20 minutes later the other three meals came out. The first three meals were already eaten and digested at that point. My wife rarely complains, but she went to the manager to tell him the situation and his response was, \"Yeah, we are busy. Sorry\".   If anything keeps me from coming back, that will be it. I can overlook service errors from teenagers. I can overlook a messy floor. But I have a hard time overlooking indifferent management. If he really doesn't care about that, what else is he blase about?",

I watched during my wait and it appeared that orders for those dining in were made before the takeout orders.  I also observed that there were no \"adults\" working; just high school kids.  Not sure if there was a manager there in the back; but there certainly needs to be or this new place isn't going to make it.  Overheard customers complaining while I was waiting; so it wasn't just me. Grilled cheese was very good and cheesy, but needed a couple minutes more on the griddle; bread was soggy.  The Pimento cheese burger - I didn't even eat a quarter of.  The burger patty was broken and crumbly; bacon curled up in a clump; pimento cheese hadn't been thoroughly mixed and was clumped on one side of the burger.   Very disappointing as this is a convenient spot to get takeout on the way home.",

It's somewhere I'll keep going whenever I feel like eating at somewhere out of the ordinary, and that's a good thing.",

We both ordered an Original combo Andy size. The burger was freshly made, juicy,  and flavorful. The fries are warm and crispy but you will need to salt to your taste.   Save room for dessert. Their custard ice cream is made in store and is quite delicious. It comes with your choice of toppings and in cups, waffle cones and even shakes.   Stop by for an inexpensive but still excellent meal. You'll be glad you did!",

We walked in to place an order to go, no obvious place to do so. I asked a server where I may place an order and she rudely said \"I'll take it, do you know what you want?\" Since it was our first time, I asked to see a menu. We ordered a cheeseburger with a side of fries and milkshake, a chicken sandwich with cheese fries, and a chicken cordon blue with onion rings. We sat waiting for our food for well over twenty minutes when I asked another server to check on our order. Turns out it was ready to go, getting cold by the front door.  We got home within five minutes ready to enjoy our food. Another disappointment. The fries had no salt or flavoring. I suspect the reason was because the onion rings had so much salt, it was the only thing I could taste. Our chicken sandwiches were flat at best, and we scrambled to find spices in the kitchen to salvage the chicken. The cheeseburger was mushy, but at least had some flavor. Our son ate it without the bread.  We wanted to love this place so badly since it is minutes from home. Unfortunately it was not to be. If I could have rated zero stars, I would have...",

    "text": "I've always heard great things about this chain, and was super excited to see that one came to Fort Mill. My friends and I decided to go tonight to give it a try ourselves.   I really liked the 50s feel to the restaurant. It's a bright, cheerful place. Unfortunately, though, it took longer than I expected to find a clean table. While walking around the restaurant I noticed an abundance of food, napkins, and straw papers littering the floor. Truly, litter was everywhere and it was noticeable. There were lots of people working, but the place wasn't super busy. I wondered why one of the waitresses or the manager couldn't go around and sweep. That turned me off. Additionally, when the waitress brought us our menus, I couldn't help but notice there was some sort of dried sauce residue stuck on my menu. They needed to be wiped down.  The food, however, was good! I got a small bacon cheeseburger and fries. The burger was seasoned well and the fries were hot. My friends shared onion rings that were also tasty, just a little greasy.  We planned to get dessert, but the ladies were cleaning the ice cream machines, so we decided not to bother them. We entered the restaurant at 9, and I guess they started cleaning it since they close at 10.  The service was great. Our waitress was a young girl who was very sweet and willing to answer our questions.  All in all, it was a good place to get a burger. Prices are reasonable and service was nice, just wish they'd work on cleanliness in the dining room.",

After walking up to a man we were told to sit wherever. Mom and I both had the Andy size bacon burger which was delicious. Cooked well, juicy... And best of all? Crispy bacon!! Yum!   What I really loved was that things were ala carte so if you just want a burger you don't feel like you wasted money. Like Red Robin they charge $9.00 for a burger and never ending fries. One- I can't eat fries (or very big portions due to weight loss surgery) do HWy 55 is perfect for me.  Waitress was quick and friendly yet a bit intrusive (yes you can come to the table too many times!) but that is better than crappy service. I will definitely return.  Pro: no wait, quick service, great tasting, great prices.  Con: No direction when entering, waitress a bit annoying.",

Standard frozen fries. Yuck. I tried a bite of a cheeseburger and it did seem tasty. The meat was juicy and tender. Other items around the table were just okay.

First, for this type of restaurant there is need to have a server come to the table and take my order.  It would be much more effective to give your order at the register, pay for it and then be given a number to put on your table for someone to bring it out.  Second, the wait staff seemed to be all teenagers.  They were all nice, but it was obvious that they didn't have a lot of experience being waitresses.  The one adult in the place (manager maybe?) was in the back cooking the food and our waitress came out to our table way too often.  I just don't know if this type of restaurant needs waitresses, maybe just runners for food and put the soda station somewhere that the customers can get to so they can do their own refills.    I was happy with my food and with a little bit of organization I think this place has a chance to be a decent burger joint.  It would have been nice if there were more booths and some separation between tables instead of one big open room with tables and chairs but this is just the way the restaurant was set up.",

    "text": "I am writing this review as my way of giving some genuine feedback to the owner.  Just because one has the working capital to open their own business does not mean that they are qualified to run the day to day operations.  Please find someone that is passionate about service and good at it and then get out of the way.  The service experience is horrendous every time at this location.  I've given them multiple chances and have been disappointed is some capacity each time I visit.  As I was sitting there last night, I finally landed on the fact that the poor experience is a function of ownership/leadership.  I'm sitting there last night watching the owner having a literal meltdown while working the grill.  You could hear him berating and talking down to the girls from Nation Ford HS that work there.  While one was taking an order at a table across the restaurant, he was yelling at her by name saying \"order\" \"let's go\" \"hurry up\".  Another went the restroom and he proceeds to walk through the restaurant like a mad man asking everyone where the poor girl went.  Then, while she is in the restroom, tells the other workers that it's ridiculous that someone has to go to the bathroom 30 minutes into their shift.  He proceeds to yell at another girl telling her that he doesn't pay her to stand around AS she was making a milkshake.  I could hear every growl, groan, and flippant comment he made and I was sitting pretty far out in the dining room.   If I were the owner, I would tread lightly with how I treat the help as most of the families that support this location are from the Nation Ford family and Springfield community and I suspect they would not support this place if they observed what I did last night.  It is not their fault that you constantly understaff your restaurant and that you lack basic skills needed to run a restaurant.  Look in the mirror chief, it's you!  Finally, as the owner, a basic function of service is to (at a minimum) SMILE, and at the least greet your customers with a hello, goodbye, and the very very least a simple \"thank you\".  He makes eye contact with people like he is trying to size them up for a fight.  Meanwhile, he is stressing the help out and based on other reviews I read...losing business in the process.  Location and convenience are what is keeping you afloat for now, but that will fade over time if you do not improve.",

The cook/manager seemed very anxious and it didn't seem like he had much help. It just seemed very sad and unenjoyable. However their tater tots were good. I would not recommend eating here.",

When I asked for a correct philly chicken steak. I was told \"No\" and that 8 had to purchase one if that's what I wanted. So I requested a refund. I will never ever go back to this Hwy 55 diner in life it could be the last one standing. To top it off I'm pregnant now what if I had eaten this sandwich and became viciously sick.",

As soon as you walk in the door you are greeted. I do love the fact that you can pick from a smaller burger or a bigger one. If I was to have a negative remark it would be that I have been noticing that the girls working in there seem to be very stressed. After watching the \"cook\" whom I am going to guess is the owner seems to be a drill sergeant. I have NEVER seen this man smile or even greet his guests. I understand he is there to see to it that the restaurant runs great but gees..I hope he chills out a bit before he has a heart attack. I pray he is not treating those young girls bad. Maybe I notice his actions because I am a mom and I would NOT want one of my kids working for him at all.",

    "text": "This place serves fairly generic burger joint fare.  It is OK but nothing special to the food.  I assume that the marketing schtick is supposed to be the 50's diner theme but the manager/staff does nothing to help this along. They really seemed tired and sort of depressed, like they're just waiting to go out of business.    I ate at the counter for a relatively late lunch (1pm).  One of the wait staff had all of her credit card receipts and other tickets from earlier in the day spread out on the counter.  I thought maybe she was finishing her shift but she didn't do anything with this mess while I was there. This seems a possible opportunity for credit card number theft?    The counter where I sat had been cleared but not wiped down.    Was told by my waitress when I asked about the burger sizes that the regular was 'the same as the kids meal', or I could \"Andy Size\" it which was \"a little bigger\".  The 'andy size' was not very big, can't imagine how small the regular must be.     With multiple burger options in Fort Mill I don't think I'll be back.",

    "text": "I have been to this location about 12 times now.  I really want to give them 3+ stars but due to areas where they are lacking, I cannot.  This is close to my home so I REALLY want them to work out the kinks because having a good burger place nearby would be awesome! Pros - close to my home, reasonably priced, most of the staff are friendly, open until 9pm, food has potential to be good (meaning it is good sometimes and other times it is blah). Cons - Burger buns are COLD (yuck), burgers do not appear to be seasoned, often receive cold fries, service is sketchy at times, interior colors are ugly but who cares if they can improve and have good food and service.   -I usually get the burgers to go because they wrap them in foil and it warms the bun. -I tried the crab cake po boy and it was close to the worst sandwich I ever had.....EVER! -The hot dogs, not too bad as the chili is pretty good but I am not a fan of the dog itself.   -Philly - this is a good sandwich if you get it to go (it warms the bun). -Sometime the onion rings are good but lately overcooked yet really greasy like they were cooked and put back in the oil and oil is old! -Fries are basic and really need some salt when they first exit the deep fryer.  1 of 4 times I get them they are COLD! -I have had tomato on several sandwiches but they are not ripe so I remove them (must have a terrible supplier) and no longer order them.  Overall it is a great location with lots of potential.  I hope the owner will look into these issues and make some changes and work with the staff.   The first week they had a server in there who was really good and was able to tend to 3 to 4 times the guest as the staff are now but sadly she has disappeared.  The rest could really learn from her!!!",
