The food is standard menu items of enchiladas, burritos, tacos, fajitas kinda thing.  I had the fajitas which were completely overcooked and a bit bland, and my friend had a burrito which got an \"ehh\" shoulder shrug.  I need to take these chips to go and then get my entree at Azteca.....happiness",

There was particles floating in my water, I order the Arroz Con Pollo which took over 25 minutes to get after we put or order in and it was BURNT! When I say burnt the onions where burnt to a black crisp! It was very unpleasant, I will not be going there EVER AGAIN!",

Meat (skirt steak) had a nice flavor but was tough - there is a fine line to cooking this cut of meat correctly and it just didn't happen.  Rice and beans just average.

Their margaritas are awesome and they even use fresh orange juice instead of all that sugary sweet and sour mix. Portions are large in my opinion and as a couple you can leave stuffed with a 25-30$ bill (excluding alcohol). My favorites are the queso dip, tostadas with pork, and their chicken tacos because they are so fresh tasting. Sometimes the service is a little slow, but overall this is my first choice if I want mexican food!",

The place was a bit small, but managed to have a bar within the premise, and was comfortable enough to accommodate quite a few people. The waiters arrived promptly, and took our orders. Nachos and salsa were on the house and we ordered guacamole along with it - guacamole was very good. For our entrees, we ordered Enchiladas Poblanos and Fajitas de Pollo. The Fajitas was served on a hot plate, and we enjoyed making our own Fajitas with the little corn tortillas. The enchiladas were also good. We had next to nothing left over, and what ever was left, we boxed it and had it the next day. Overall, a very nice dinner, good ambiance (a bit noisy, but this should be expected), good service and we had a nice experience going there. Tip - First Check-in with Foursquare would give you a free small guacamole when you buy two entrees.",

Ended up sitting at the bar.  On the previous two times service had been uneven but Sasha was our server and she took excellent care of us. (She is very nice, explained the menu and is smoking hot) The chips are fresh and the salsa is out-of-this-world. There was a guy getting takeout and I asked him what he recommended.  He said it is all good but his go-to item was the enchiladas mixta.  I got that and told Sasha to mix it up steak and chicken.  Got two steak, two chicken with a piece of grilled skirt steak.  The chicken was good but the two steak ones were beyond compare especially the one with the mole.  I think Sasha said that it was the \"poblano\" one.  I am amazed at the negative reviews.  The restaurant itself is not much to look at and the parking is tight (there is parking behind the restaurant) but other than those two small things I have nothing negative to say.  On my other two visits I would have given them four stars because of the service but Sasha is the best.  Nice and personable.  Food takes a while to get there but I think that is because everything is so fresh.  They even have the Mexican Coca-Cola in the thick glass bottles made with real sugar.  My buddy had a margarita which he said was top-notch.  Did not sample any desserts but saw them serving Flan and huge pieces of cake.  If you want atmosphere probably not your place.  You want great food; you will have a winner.",

Spanish??? really? I rolled it off even though it was quite annoying. The chips and salsa came...the chips were decent enough-nothing to rave about but the salsa tasted like ragu meets some cilantro and onions. It was terrible. I ordered enchiladas which weren't awful my father dined on the mole which had the same sauce as my enchiladas....bland at best. the only thing that made my enchiladas worth it was the queso fresco that topped it. The beans were more of a blob...nothing special- the rice was fairly decent. Everything on my plate lacked seasoning. My mother had no complaints about her meal but she's nicer than I am. The waitstaff was nice...they are a bit lax but coming from Houston I kind of expected it...after my remarks about the salsa they promptly brought us different salsa which fit more of my expectations.

How I haven't been here before is beyond me, but wow, I'll become a regular now.  First off the chips: Seasoned & crunchy! There's nothing worse than soggy, soft chips...no fear here!  And smart Tonya got us an order of guacamole - FRESH guacamole. Nice sized tomatoes & cilantro & good consistency/texture of the avacodo.  $5.00 margaritas on Friday? Why not!? They're huge & so refreshing, but had just enough tequila that I was one & done.  Poor Dion was headed into her big girl job, so she couldn't enjoy any. :(  I went with the four steak tacos off the lunch menu...but you can order them with chicken, too. And of course, I got the cilantro & onion, which was heavily piled on. I'm cool with that!  Both were fresh, the onions a little too fresh; even after partaking some yelp mints, I'm still tasting onion. :D The steak, was in small tiny pieces & tasted SOOOO good! Wow, I was so impressed.  Normally I'm used to the steak in tacos being the skinny strips of steak, so Three Amigos way is much better.  It was seasoned nicely, too.  Other notes: Prices are very reasonable, place is clean, & service was exceptional.    Cons: It's pretty small & parking is extremely limited.",

    "text": "Located in the Plaza Midwood/Merry Oaks area, this popular Mexican spot seems to have a pretty loyal following around town these days.  I am definitely a fan of Three Amigos, but if I am being truly honest with myself, 2/4 of those stars might be due to the fact that this Three Amigos location is within walking distance of my house...       Don't get me wrong, the food is definitely good, just sometimes, I find that it can be a little on the bland side.  For example, I got a large order of guac recently, and although it was teeming with fresh tomatoes, onions and cilantro, it still required a good salting to give it anything close to flavor.  Although I've tried my different items, my go-to entree is the Steak Burrito Special.  Its your classic, monster burrito stuffed with rice, steak and smothered with melted queso-cheese.  Very good, just can't call it great.  Once again, the actual burrito only contains rice and steak - no peppers or onions, no cheese, no guac, no sour cream - not much inside the actual burrito to add much needed flavor.  As a result, I find myself salting every bite!  The shrimp fajitas are good and are served with plenty of big (though tough), grilled jumbo shrimp, rice and beans as well as peppers and onions.    Despite what you get, everything is very reasonably priced and is a great value considering the amount of food you receive.       Although, I've only actually dined-in at Three Amigos three or four times, the service as always been great.  The servers are always super polite, friendly, and accommodating to whatever your specific tastes may be.  I do however order take-out from here very frequently.  My order has always been correct, and it was always been ready within the time frame they gave me.    Oh and parking can def be tight on Friday and Saturday evenings in the small plaza Three Amigos is located in.    I'l def be back, probably later this week....food won't knock your socks off, but its good enough value to keep me a fan!",

    "text": "I am about to say something that may cause a lot of backlash... I don't think this is a Mexican joint (and by \"Mexican\" I am referring to the Americanized version of Mexican I'm used to, mainly like that of Azteca or Monterrey). Don't get me wrong, there's absolutely nothing wrong with not being a Mexican restaurant, but I wish I know the True origin of their kitchen and then I can just order what they are great at.  Just let's talk about the logic behind my statement. I have eaten here many times now, and something about their finished products just don't look quite \"Mexican.\" They have potatoes in their rice, which is more yellow and not that orange color. Excellent rice, but just not quite Meixcan rice. Then the other night we were there for a group dinner and when Arroz Con Pollo came out, it looked like Fried Rice! There was no tomato sauce, or melted cheese, or sliced avocado. It tasted good, GIANT portion, a great deal to be honest, but then it just wasn't the Gringo Mexican style Arroz Con Pollo one may be craving for.  SO - here is my verdict: eat here because it has good food, but I wouldn't say this is the BEST Mexican place since I'm not quite sure it is Mexican. And I hope one day they will have a side menu of the real origin of their kitchen staffs, because I am honestly dying to know what am I  really missing here.  P.S. If you are to have their empanadas, go for the beef or veggies - somehow their chicken ones tend to be dry and tasteless.",

The food is delicious.  I had the enchilada special and the taste was phenomenal.  I tried pork, beef and chorizo and am hard pressed to pick a fav.  The accompanying margarita was also potent and good (though nothing special, but still good).  The chips and salsa were also on point.   The perfect thickness and kick to the salsa.   Ok for rating this five stars I wish I could write more.  But simply put this is the best Mexican I have had in Charlotte.  Note it isn't approaching best of all time...that goes to La Rancherita in Quad Cities, IL.  That spot is the one thing I miss about the Midwest.",

A friend and I ventured in on a Thursday right after work, and we were the first ones there at 5:30; by the time we left around 7:15, the place was hoppin' with mostly yuppies and families.  Our waitress was so nice! We started with the queso fundido ($4.49), and it came with chorizo and onions - a new thing for me, but delicious. We both got the tacos al pastor ($8.95), and they were superb! My friend wanted them to be a little spicier, but I like mine sweeter, so I was all set.  Great food, great service, inexpensive - a fantastic trifecta!",

The service was strange: I am still not sure which of the three peopl who tag-teamed our table was our actual server, and in spite of the group effort, it was weirdly slow to get our order taken and drinks refilled. The dip trio was not worth getting--the table salsa was significantly better than the pico (and I like chunky salsa!), which had a strange aftertaste. The guacamole was chunky and needed the piquancy of limes. The queso was served with a skin. The rice was dry and the beans were mediocre--but for me refried beans are only worth eating if they taste like bacon fat. My chicken chimichanga was fantastic. And the sweet plantains (I know, odd combination) were heavenly. It was a relatively inexpensive meal, though perhaps I'm just used to Alaska prices, and I left full. A solid choice but I've had better.",

First impressions... Three Amigos is located in a small strip mall on Cental past the new McDonlads coming from uptown but before you get to the Eastway. When we walked in the waitress seated us immediately and took our drink orders and brought us chips and salsa. The restaurant decor is pretty cute a lot of colorful paintings.   Food: I ordered the chicken chimichanga and it was exactly as I pictured it. Perfect. It might just be a \"me\" thing but I really do prefer shredded chicken in my Mexican food compared to chunks. The chimichanga had just that. It was hot, fresh, crispy and delicious. Most of the lunch specials come with rice and beans like most Mexican restaurants.   Service: VERY FRIENDLY!!! Oh....and I had to do a double take at the price! Really only $5.95??? Umm... I think I should get out of uptown more often and drive down to Three Amigos!  One word: Authentic!",

    "text": "Dropped in here on a big ole' Unofficial Yelper Field Trip to conduct a little reconnaissance on the current state of affairs of this little restaurant that could.  After sampling the wares, Three Amigos needs to change its name 'cause it just gained a new friend.  Started things off with a trio of salsa/dips and some lightly seasoned tortilla chips.  While even the red salsa was nicely done, the real stars were the tomatillo sauce and especially the green sauce blend of jalapenos and avocados.  This alone sets Amigos apart from the rest of the Mexican fare pact in town.  Also got to try the guacamole.  Nice and smooth, with a good blend of flavors, though I'd like it to have a little more kick with the spiciness.  Best part of all, a nice-sized boat of guac clocks in at just $3.75.  That's less than half the price of fancier places that mix it at your table- and as far as I'm concerned, I'll do without the show where the flavors are so good.  Entrees all looked good, but I tried out their pure vegan fare, and many props to them for giving this a go.  I had a trio of tostadas with beans, zucchini, and still more veggies.  I now know it is totally possible to eat Mexican without the cheese and sour cream.  Veggie fajitas and enchiladas verdes are also available in both a vegan and a vegetarian variety, though not listed as such on the menu- just ask the staff.  Loved the friendly atmosphere here from the waitresses right over to the manager, who checked in on us several times.  Also loved the fact the there is a mix of Latinos and gringos who stop in to dine here- a good sign you have come to the right place for serious eats.  By the way, if you are jonesin' for some authentic street food late at night, Three Amigos recently launced a late-night menu from 10 PM till 4 AM on Fridays and Saturdays.  Empanadas, chimi-churris and quipe.  Sounds like it's time for another reconnaissance mission- late-night style!",

You might be thinking that any old sizzling hot skillet containing onions, bell peppers, tomatoes and perfectly cooked chicken is fully capable of making your grandmother blush; however, where Three Amigos triumphs is the seasonings that really made it stand out--strongly peppered, but with a little more complexity that tasted just as good the next day.

I will print any compliment I get about Three Amigos.\" in comparison to so many good reviews, I had to check it out.  I'm back, and I'm telling you you're wrong.  This is authentic Mexican.  Yes, the waitresses spoke more Spanish than English.  But who cares when the food is delicious?  My margarita was wonderful - perfectly salted rim, not too strong but enough that I felt it.  Plus, I got a t-shirt with it for Cinco de Mayo!  The chips are tasty, not too thin but not too thick, with a unique seasoning.  I enjoyed the salsa, the green spicy salsa, and the even spicier new red chile salsa (sneaky spicy!).  I ordered the enchilada/tostada combinacion, and the waitress (correctly) made a suggestion that I swap my meat options for each (asada and chicken) and I appreciate that heads up.   I love getting fresh avocado on top of my tostada.  Their beans are delicious.  The rice was tasty.  Their enchilada sauce was delectable.  I did not try their guacamole, so I cannot compare that to Azteca.  But where my entree is concerned, I would def prefer Three Amigos.  Overall, I had a great experience and would def go back again.  Keep in mind this is more hole-in-the-wall Mexican vs. 1511 Cantina \"fancy\" Mexican, but I think each definately have their place in my heart.  And I want to go back today for $.99 tacos at lunchtime.",

Still, the flavors were balanced and there was a nice little black pepper zing.  Guac was fresh and just a wee bit salty for me, but hey, I took the remainder home so that says something.  Ordered the Green Chile enchiladas sub veggies for the protein. It was GINORMOUS. I managed to eat a full half a portion. And I'm happily stuffed.  Lots of crisp lettuce on top too, rather than the sad little side garnish of lettuce you may see at other joints. The cotilla was fresh and plentiful too.  And, normally I cringe at the ever-present side of refried beans and rice - but again, freshly made and tasty.  Didn't have a Marg this time, but spied some on the other tables that looked worthwhile.  In short, I will be going back WHEN I recover from my current food coma.",

    "text": "My husband and I moved to Charlotte about 9 months ago from Los Angeles.  We are both native Spanish-speaking Latinos and grew up in households where eating traditional Mexican foods as well as Central American foods was part of our daily lives (I'm from Nicaragua and my husband is Mexican-Cuban)....   Coming to Charlotte, we knew that it would be difficult to find food that even comes close to the awesome-ness of LA's Mexican-food scene.  We are truly foodies when it comes to Mexican and Latino cuisine....   Well, Three Amigos is as close as  you're going to get to the BEST Mexican cuisine in Charlotte.  All the food is made from scratch and they serve traditional Mexican fare: tacos in warm corn tortillas, topped with onions and cilantro; Enchiladas made from scratch with authentic sauces.... If you eat meat, their Al Pastor is pork marinated in spices over 24-hours and is phenomenal... The Gorditas are hand-made: thick, hand-made corn tortillas stuffed with goodness; Plus, you can tell everything by the rice and beans (the staple of any mexican dish or latino dish)... Their mexican rice is just like my father-in-law used to make and refried pinto beans that are fresh, not from a can!  You cannot get Mole anywhere else in Charlotte that is authentic - this is the only place I have found that makes an amazing mole....  Plus, if you've got little ones, they are a family-friendly spot too... Our two-year old loves it here!  The service is great - everyone is friendly and attentive.... you may have to wait a little bit for your food but that's because it's actually home-made and not \"reheated\" from a can.... Do yourself a favor, and head over there for some delicious food!",

    "text": "The enchiladas poblano (mole) will change your life. Seriously! After spending a Sunday at Carrawinds, my family and I were famished. With a party of nine, we wanted something good, filling, and inexpensive. I whipped out my phone, pulled up my Yelp app, and searched for best Mexican restaurant near our current location. Thank you sweet Yelpers for sending us to this place! The restaurant space is on the small side, so we had a bit of a wait. Luckily there were a few available chairs at the bar and a few empty seats on the patio. The men opened bar tabs and sipped on brewskis while the waitresses cleared tables and made space for our large party. Once seated, our drink orders were promptly taken. Shortly after, drinks were delivered and food orders were immediately taken. Everyone enjoyed their meal! I accidentally ordered the wrong sauce for my enchiladas; since I was starving, I decided I would just keep them. After a bite or two I realized the sauce was far too spicy and acidic for my palate to enjoy. I called our waitress over and apologetically explained that my enchiladas were too spicy to enjoy. She, without hesitation, said \"Don't worry! I will bring you the correct enchiladas. There might be a wait since we're packed. Is that okay?\" I replied yes. Thinking it would take a while to receive my new dish, I decided to enjoy my rice and beans as I waited. Not even five minutes after removing my old dish, the waitress returned with freshly prepared enchiladas. Holy MOLE!!!! :)  Whenever I'm in the Charlotte area, I will be sure to return. The food is fresh, authentic, palate pleasing, affordable, and the customer service is great! That's a four-star visit in my opinion. And judging by the other comments, my fellow Yelpers agree!",

The outdoor setting isn't the most ideal - a parking lot on busy busy Central, but that's ok.   They have just enough vegetarian options, but there's certainly room for more. I'd be thrilled if they offered a core veg protein like tofu to add into burritos, fajitas, etc. I got the fajitas and they were pretty good. They come with on a steaming plate piled high with veggies, and another plate with rice (VERY overcooked), beans, lettuce, and avocado. Wish it had been guacamole but again, not a big deal. Only downside to fajitas is you smell like fajitas for the rest of the night!  We didn't get any drinks, but their margaritas are enormous and clearly well-enjoyed by the crowd.",

The server was attentive and friendly, she brought us our chips, salsa, and queso pretty quickly. The chips were good but the salsa and queso were far from acceptable. I have never eaten such watery salsa and queso in my life, no bueno!!! The server was unable to switch the watery salsa out for a chunky version.   We came in specifically for the endless enchilada special for $8.99, not a bad deal. We had a choice of chicken or beef with red or green sauce. The enchiladas did take a while to come out but we didn't mind, had plenty of time to kill before our Star Wars showing at 11p. I loved the red enchilada sauce, very flavorful! The chicken inside was not seasoned however, it was juicy. This carried over into the chicken empanada which was free with Yelp check in, not an item I would order on my own. I didn't like the green enchilada sauce as much. I was struggling to finish my second plate. 4/5 for the red enchiladas. The other star was docked for the salsa and queso.   All in all, thanks to Three Amigos and Dalton for bringing me in for a sit down dinner. I will be back for enchilada Thursdays and will only be ordering the red sauce. I will also be bringing my own salsa for my next Three Amigos outing, I'm not a risk taker.",

I personally love the chip dip trio they offer, maybe my favorite app in charlotte.  This one comes with fresh pico (the real stuff with a fresh hit of lime), fresh quac and my favorite - cheese dip!  This all for only about 5-6 dollars, and they will bring you chips until you cannot eat another.  The best part about this play may be the enchiladas poblanas.  So good, my wife has literally never gotten anything except for those, and we have been here a bunch, gets them every time.  I usually for the fajitas mixtas or enchiladas mixtas, but excellent samplers of their meets and the enchiladas mixtas comes with an entire steak on the side!

If that table had been a horse, ala 1950's westerns, \"they\" would have shot it in the head to put it out of it's misery.   MARGARITA Secondly, you ARE going to want a second Margarita. Even though they are large, my first one was almost gone before my food arrived. How large you ask? I got in a pretty good arm curl workout drinking those 'Ritas. Curl. Sip. \"Ahhhh.\" Curl. Sip. \"Ahhhh.\" Repeat. Feel the burn!  The Amigos' Margaritas are made with freshly squeezed lime juice, good tequila, triple sec, lime and orange slices, and a ton of salt on the rim. My waitress, who was also serving as the bartender, showed me their placard as having been selected Charlotte's BEST Margarita. The two that I had were the best in recent memory, so I don't dispute their claim. (They are also made QUICKLY!) <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/three-amigos-mexican-restaurant-and-cantina-charlotte?select=xVPIVNwRtkg83jlm2N_2aA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/thre...</a>  GUAC ME, BABY! A MUST is ordering their chunky guacamole with pico de gallo, because it is amazing! I always get a small, appetizer size, portion to go along with the chips and salsa. I have never eaten better guac. The appetizer size is plenty for one, but for two or more people you'll need to order a larger sized portion.   CHIPS, AND SALSA, AND GUAC.....OH, MY! Oh, speaking of the chips and salsa....the chips come out warm and covered in some type of red spice. They are good.  The salsa \"appears\" to be homemade, and it is filled with bits of onions, tomato, and chiles. I have not had better gratis salsa anywhere else. I usually add a little hot sauce for good measure.  TACOS Entree: I ordered the TACOs AL PASTOR today for a change. They were just \"okay.\" Three Amigos scrimps on their taco filling as it is, but there were only one or two pieces of pineapple in both tacos. The flavor was also not as good as their charcoal grilled tasting carne asada tacos, which are very good. I still have not found an entree dish that has blown me away yet, but I'm still hopeful. The carne asada tacos are $7.95, and the tacos al pastor are $8.95. Both are too expensive for the meager portions received compared to other places.   To offset that a bit.....the refried beans and yellow rice are wonderful. I cleaned my plate, which I rarely do in a Mexican restaurant.   SERVICE?  Usually good to excellent.  ATMOSPHERE?  Loud! The Hispanic music here reminds me of an 80's Latin disco dance party. This place rocks! There is Tele-MUN-DO comedies on the TV, which get funnier and funnier as the margaritas accumulate.   CUANTO CUESTA?  Expect to pay $20+ per person, IF you go full tilt boogie and order a little bit of everything, including a couple of grande margaritas.   I like to splurge once in awhile without worrying about prices. I used to go to a good steak house, but more and more lately I find myself craving tacos, great guac, and grande margarita(s). Maybe I'll see you there next Friday.",

I unfortunately live up the street from it so I find myself here for dollar tacos on weekdays 1-5pm far too often haha.   I can never remember the name of my favorite dish but it's Pollo something and it comes in a stewed red sauce with tortillas and full jalapenos. One of the best Mexican dishes I've ever had and it's like 8 bucks. Typically I get two meals out of a lo of their entrees; the portions are huge. Not complaining. Their nacho plate is fit for a small village as well!  Tequila Tuesdays are surely dangerous and Their margaritas specials are the same. This place gets packed on Fridays and Saturdays!",

It's a rather small place tucked in a cruddy shopping center with very little parking.    Since I was runing late, my friends were already noshing on some beautifully green and tasty guac and tortilla chips.After ordering, I realized why it is considered so authentic. My tacos were small flour tortillas open-faced with cubed beef cheese and cilantro. A heaping side of rice and refried beans.  I did ask for sour cream but never got it.  The portions were hardy and topped with the guac and salsa from the table made them quite tasty.  My friends ordered the pork belly tacos, shrimp quesilda and burritos.  All the portions were huge and the burrito was gorgeous, deep friend and top with queso sauce, sour cream tomatos and lettuce.  Believe me when I tell you that I didn't eat another meal until breakfast the next morning!",

A note to people...I took the hubby and he is not and adventurous eater. He thought it was ok but I had gotten him tacos to go before and loved them. He did Fajitas this time and said they were a little bland. BUT he was too scared to try the green avocado salsa that is amazing. His loss.

We spent $45 on an iced tea, two cans of Coke, which they advertised as bottles (no refills-I'm comfortable with the no refills, but honestly expected something interesting like Coke made with cane sugar from Mexico at $2 a bottle).  We also had cheese dip, which reminded me of the unfortunate time I made the mistake of buying the microwaveable cheese dip in the grocery store for a quick, easy app.  We had the mixed fajitas which had mushy vegetables, were overcooked and dry and a bit \"over-caramelized.\"  My partner had the shrimp tostadas.  Both were bland and had nothing authentic about them, more importantly they were lacking ingredients advertised, such as sour cream. Just when you thought it was impossible to mess up tortilla chips, there's were burnt, reheated, and stale.  I've traveled throughout Latin America, lived in Spain and Mexico, and along with my Hispanic partner agree that my mother-in-law would never put any of this food on her table. It was just poor, disappointing, and i feel sick at my stomach from this food.  Whether it's been a five-star restaurant or a taco truck, I've had better food elsewhere and I'm greatly disappointed at the value for the price paid. At no point, even after seeing our barely eaten food, did the server ever ask if everything was okay.    I wish that we had left once the plastic, buttery wax of a bowl of cheese dip arrived...",

If you're looking for a fancy pants Mexican establishment, don't waste your time here. But if you're like me and on occasion you crave delicious, authentic and affordable Mexican fare with a low-key atmosphere, consider this as good as it gets in Charlotte.  The daily drink specials are bangin' especially $5 jumbo margaritas on Fridays. But don't worry, every other day they are only $6 each. Prepare yourself that they are delicious. And.huge. And.full.of.alcohol. The service is kind, warm and friendly. There are a handful of servers who speak enough English to effectively jot down your order and if not, well, work on your Espanol, kid.  And the food. Delicioso, compadre. I've sampled a few different things here but I really enjoy their guacamole - full of flavor and cilantro. Next time I may ask if they can make it spicy, too! Their tacos (soft corn) are tasty and, again, garnished with a smattering of spice and cilantro. The chicken was succulent and well prepared and I also tried a shredded beef enchilada. Taaaaasty. Portions as a whole are pretty generous and, inevitably, I always leave this place seeking a siesta. I definitely want to come back and try a few other items...perhaps mole next time?!",

Among the dives of Central Avenue is Three Amigos, a fantastic blend of Mexican and Dominican food that is loaded with flavor. Real hand-made corn tortillas, flavorful meats, and slightly addictive rice await you. I've had their burrito, an open-faced knife-and-fork endeavor that uses fresh avocado in lieu of guac, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Most recent visit, though, I skipped the plates and assembled my own entree from the street food menu. Two gorditas (completely forget the Taco Bell tragedy you are thinking of - looks and tastes nothing like that) and a side of rice. My hint to you: go for sausage as your meat. Spicy without being hot and a perfect black char give it a smokey quality.  The margaritas are to die for - order one, you won't regret it. They arrive as a clear drink with a slight cloudiness and a lime wedge. Why not the customary radioactive green? These things are fresh! Silver tequila and fresh lime juice mix to create these Three Amigos signatures.  They can get crowded, however, so shoot for a non-traditional meal time to get seated faster.",

The communication was slightly difficult because it seemed our waitress's English was borderline and my Spanish is muy malo. Also had a groupon which caused to be slightly problematic..",

I used to think Azteca held the crown but the power has swung full swing into Three Amigos' hands!    Reading the reviews I too had to try the margaritas.....delicious!  I had the enchiladas (came with 3) for my main meal and it was equally divine.  Important to know about this place is, yes it's campy inside, yes it's crowded but believe me it's worth it!",

And serving each taco in two corn tortillas? Amigo, you're talking my language, and that's the language of love. Rice and beans are good too, not just fillers to be looked over. The enchiladas al hormo were topped with an unbelievable avocado/cilantro sauce that I could not get enough of. The amount of food they serve for the price, fantastico.   Also, they serve the best orchata I've had outside of California. For serious. I want to come back, every day.",

    "text": "11/16/10  Come here only for the margaritas!  And maybe the flan.    We almost turned away, bec. Mom doesn't like \"hole in the wall\" places.  She's no food snob, but she does appreciate pretty spaces, and this place wasn't.  But we weren't here for the ambience-- we were here solely bec. a couple of my Charlotte Yelp friends recommended it!  Thank goodness my nephew was around; For some reason, he has this grounding effect on our Mom, and she rarely makes a fuss where we go, as long as he's there.  :)  (Thinking back, though, I don't think I'd like to take my nephew back to this part of town-- a bit seedy, and this was around 1p!)  First order of business: un frozen margarita ($5), por favor!  Second order of business, nos dan tortillas con salsa y guacamole (gratis), por favor!  Actually, give THEM some chips, I'll just take a few sips of the marg...  Nephew wanted a cheese quesadilla ($5.99); sis wanted a combo plate-- a chicken taco and a beef enchilada ($7.49), con arroz y frijoles refritos; and I one of those lovely-looking tortas Milanesa ($7.99) con pastor (seasoned grilled pork).  The margarita was good.  As usual, Mom and sis filled up on the free chips and salsa...  I heard that the cheese crisp was OK, too.  It was better-received than the taco/enchilada combo.  I don't think she finished any of it!  My torta looked good, but one bite of the bread and my hopes of a fantastic sandwich thrill went south of the border!  Having looked at prior food shots from other TA reviews, I was expecting this crusty telera bread w/ a soft interior, but no way, Jose!  No crispiness anywhere- just a soft roll.  Another proof that the photos here are deceiving (including the ones I've posted)- the meat portion was sorely lacking.  It's as if they stuff just enough meat in the center so that, when sliced, a cool food shot can be taken!  \"Donde el res?!?!\"  (\"Where's the beef?!?!\")  Ayayay, pero there was the yummy flan, which we all thought was pretty good, considering Mom and I make some mean flan ourselves!  Three Amigos' flan even looks like the ones our Mom used to crave for when she was pregnant w/ me-- slightly overcooked, w/ air pockets, and the edges crisped just so.  (Hmm... was I describing myself, or the flan?  LOL)  Well, this one had the air pockets.  The edges were of a firmer texture, and as we progressed to the center, it became slightly creamier.    We may come back for another margarita and more flan, but not anytime soon.",

The menu has good options, like the taco plate with al pastor and carne asada or a loaded cheese covered chimichanga. Service has never been bad and the last time our lunch group went we had an exceptional server.  My dinner experiences are fine here but it stands out for lunch in all the best ways.  Sometimes the wait for the food is just a bit long, that's my only knock, but it's worth it.",

The chips are made fresh and are seasoned making them so delicious you could eat them by themselves but the salsa is also amazing! I ordered the steak chimichanga. It was good but not as crispy as I would have liked and it was filled with more rice and beans than steak, I'm used to them being more cheesy with the meat and peppers and onions inside, so next time I will ask to hold the rice and beans. My bf ordered nachos, a taco, and a burrito. Claimed he was starving and didn't even get through half of it because the portion size of the appetizer nachos was huge, enough for a stand alone meal. He loved all of his food. Also, you get a free empanada for checking in on Yelp how awesome is that! We will have to redeem ours on the next visit because the food we had ordered was more than enough.",

For example, they don't have a specific vegetarian section that other Mexican restaurants have on their menus.  The restaurant was kind of cramped.

Shrimp Quesadilla - Edible, but not good!   I will never be back!! I Would Not Recommend This Place At All!!!",

    "text": "So we happened to stumble upon this restaurant on a cool breeze Thursday. This place is fairly small but it doesn't take away from their well seasoned tortilla chips (which was a hit with their salsa). Side note: if you check-in via YELP, purchase two drinks and an entree, you will receive a free plain queso dip. I  ordered the shrimp quesadilla and I've definitely had better, in general.  My significant other ordered the Al Pastor and he was pretty pleased with that. Their customer service is so-so. It took the waitress a long time to bring our bill after requesting it and we were ready to go at this point. Apparently their card machine wasn't working but she never communicated this until we requested it again. However the good news is, they have half off Tequila on Wednesdays.  All of their Tequila shots are half price and on Fridays they have a dollar off of their margaritas.  Their house margarita was good and strong. In conclusion, I don't have to return (unless it's to go drinking).",

The restaurant was not full when I arrived but became so after I placed my order.  3 parties that arrived 15-20 minutes after I had placed my order waited to be seated, placed their orders and received their food before me.  I had to wait 40 minutes for 2 tacos!   So if you like establishments that 'hold' to-go orders then by all means visit Three Amigos.  The only worse part was that there was a gentleman who had placed his to-go order 10 minutes before me was still waiting for his order when I left.  I will not be visiting again.",

Their margaritas are insanely good (not fluorescent green pre-made mix like most places), the food is delicious and the service is always friendly and fast. My favorite lately has been the Enchiladas Verdes, the portion is so big you easily have enough for lunch the next day. Their homemade flour tortillas are also worth a shout-out.   I love this place - try to go on the early side before there is a wait. You should also go on a Friday for a $5 giant house margarita!",

Tacos de pollo were alright but the rice that accompanied was the best part ,I am a huge fan of Mexican rice and not all places get it right . I told the waitress that I have checked in on yelp and asked for the free Empanada which was also pretty good with crispy pastry and cheesy chicken filling .Fajitas were excellent and could easily be shared among 2 people  Not so positives : Service ,none of the waiters seated us for the first 5 minutes even though there were empty tables. Place itself was cramped and there was food all over the floor and the waitress charged us for the Empanada which was supposed to be free . What made me uncomfortable was a particular \"group\" of diners that did not looked OK to be stepping out in public and clearly acted weird to whom any other restaurant would have denied the service . Its a shame that I dont see myself going back here despite their excellent food.",

We had to leave.   They did give us 50% off our bill. As we were leaving they set the roach booth for two couples waiting by the door. We told the customers not to sit there as we left.  We won't go back.  UPDATE: The owner responded and apologized here. Unfortunately, he did not do so the evening we ate there.  He just told the waitress to give us 50% off.

Be warned: if you order plain queso they will charge you 4.49 which is the same price as the queso with the chorizo so go ahead and go for the upgraded queso. We both got chicken chimichangas and they were really good As well. I have had chimichangas that were fried but these seemed not to be. They are topped with queso, lettuce, tomato and avocado. The ingredients are very fresh and I really appreciate that. Margaritas on Friday are 5$! Check in on yelp and you get a free empanada which was one of my favorite things. It's a fried tortilla stuffed with chicken and cheese.",

    "text": "How have I not done a review of this place before???  Actually, I was planning on a 3 star review due to my last experience and assumed I already had given them 5 stars prior.  Pretty much my go-to Mexican place in Charlotte.  Its been a while, since Sabor opened, I've gone the \"fast food\" route.  When a group of 5 awesome lady friends want you to join them though, you don't say no.  They didn't have a table for 6 and a couple of us had other things we had to do so we broke the group up into 2 tables.  First I ordered some nachos that never came.  No biggie, that was more for the group of 6 anyhow.  We ordered our food, they ordered there's.  The food for our table came out.  I got the arroz con pollo.  They forgot my tortillas, so I had to ask for some.  I had never gotten this dish here before but it was more like chicken fried rice from a Chinese place with avocado on top.  I ate it though.  A pretty nice sized plate of food, although slacking on chicken portions.  Our table actually finished our meals before we went to go visit our other table who still hadn't even gotten their food yet.  We ordered more beers, paid our checks and then went back over to the other table.  Still no food, not much in the way of apology either.  Since a couple of us had other places we needed to be, they eventually just asked for their food to go.  I'd honestly give this a 1-2 star if this was my only visit.  I know what these guys can do though.  I hope my next visit is a little better.",

Margarita the size of my face was absolutely delish and well priced in my opine! Easily the best house marg in Charlotte.   We watched two different people order the nachos. The nachos are the craziest thing I have ever seen. A huge platter completely (and I literally mean completely) covered and then mountain piled up with all this craziness. This order could probably single handedly fill up 6 people. My hubby and I were discussing that our next movie marathon, we are gonna order this to go and be set the whole night!!  We started with the trio dip for the table. For $6, this is a great tizer option. The queso was delish and the guac was perfectly made!! My husband and I split the enchiladas mixtas and added rice and beans. Basically it is 4 enchiladas with a side of steak. Yes, you heard me correctly....a freaking side of steak!! All the enchiladas were fantastic. Do yourself a favor and split something here. We split and I still felt like I ate my body weight in Mexican  I left the evening with my workout for the day negated, an extremely full self, and my clothes smelling like Mexican (no joke). Mission accomplished.",

    "text": "If you want sloppy, great-tasting, Americanized Mexican food where you walk in hungry and walk out hating yourself for eating all of those chips, Three Amigos is the top place to go in Charlotte.  Now look, in no way can this place touch the authentic Mexican food restaurants I grew up going to in Arizona.  If this is what you're looking for, then forget it.  Walk out the door (but get a margarita first).  We're talking large plates of rice and beans, with a delicious tortilla filled with something smothered in sauce, sour cream, cheese and lettuce.  This is what you get.  So with that being said and setting expectations, the food here is great.  The Chicken Chimichanga is amazing.  The chicken was nice a moist, which is hard to do with this dish.  Salad was good (not healthy, but absolutely delish).  Chips are always great with that little seasoning on top of it.  Enchiladas were also great.  I went on a Thursday, which I found out was all-you-can-eat enchilada night.  Of course, I found this out AFTER I ordered.  Grrrrr...  This is a cute, casual place to come alone and sit at the bar or come with friends (they accommodate large parties).  I made the mistake of going here on a date (ok, my fault, I was craving Mexican and really just wanted someone to go with me to Three Amigos), so it's not conducive to a romantic, get-to-know-you conversation.  This isn't a huge restaurant, so try heading there before/after the dinner rush.",

    "text": "It actually breaks my heart that I feel so compelled to write this review because this place has been my GO-TO for years, and I have always brought people here because the food, drinks, service and experience has always been 2nd to none for the best Mexican food in the Queen City. I fact I almost never write reviews, but tonight I had what I can only describe as a dismal experience in a place I normally adore.   I brought several friends, one of whom had never been but was excited to hear what all the hype was about. I have to wonder whether the management has changed, as I see that most, if not all the servers have in the last year or so. Our server was rude and dismissive from the moment we sat down. We came in at about 9:10 pm and while I understand that they close at 10, the rush he put on us made us understand that we weren't particularly welcome. He actually argued with me about my order (that I have been getting for 5 years) and then when I was forced to change it to something he agreed with, came out wrong. He apparently expected it to be wrong because he asked me to check if it was correct when it came out. Indeed it was wrong. While the rest of the table ate and finished their meals, I waited for my 2nd choice to come out for the second time. Once my correct meal did come, I began to eat it an within 5 minutes all the lights in the restaurant came on. There were 4 tables still sitting in the restaurant and I had an almost full meal in front of me. I was embarrassed for bringing friends here and we sat there for 10 more minutes while I scrambled to finish my meal and get out of there as it was more than clear that we were unwelcome.   I do want to stress that this is the first and only time I have had any experience even remotely as awful as this, and I have been here easily more than 50 times. Yet, I have seen the culture of the restaurant changing along with all the servers attitudes over the last year, and I wonder if this is going to be one of the last times I bother to come. There are several other great Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, and I would really miss this gem if things don't shift back to the kind of sincere and welcoming service they have always had over the years. The margaritas are the best in Charlotte and I will definitely give it one more shot. But probably just one more unless I have the kind of experience I always thought I could count on before.",

I ordered the one taco and one cheese enchilada combo. The carne asada was bad.. you could barely chew the meat it was crispy hard, the tortilla's dry, the cilantro/onion mixture lacked lime... The cheese enchilada was gross, even with the hot ass salsa verde on it... Not sure what kind of cheese they used, processed? It was gross. The rice was okay.... the beans bland...   Jeez kids, so sorry, this southern cali girl just didn't find this authentic enough to re-visit.   Also, no free wi-fi and they do not accept AMEX.  Oh and I though the food was pricey.",

Maybe I am not ordering the right thing, but a lot of times I feel the food is nothing different from what you get at most Hispanic/Mexican places. I have tried the red enchiladas, the enchiladas verde, and there special enchiladas (I forget the name), which are actually more of tostadas. All were good, none were great. I will say the staff is always great and the service is never bad. Maybe I will try it again sometime, because it is a friendly place to go with friends, but I am not that impressed.",

I got a little taste awhile back at a Yelp event but I had yet to stop in for myself and experience what this place really has to offer.    The menu is extensive and has all your traditional Mexican favorites like tacos and burritos.  DO NOT  leave this place without trying the enchiladas.  I decided on the Enchiladas Rojas I think I made an excellent decision.  Most Mexican joints I've tried in the area if I order enchiladas I get a big plate of greasy cheesy goodness with some unmemorable sauce.  Not at Three Amigos the waitress asked if I wanted my red sauce spicy (she must know me)  this was the most delicious enchilada sauce I've ever had it had a really nice kick to it.  $8.99 three huge enchiladas and after all my chips I took two enchiladas home and had dreams about them all night.  They were just as good the next day.  As you can see I highly recommend Three Amigos.",

I love the queso with onion and chorizo to start, chips can sometimes be mediocre, but are usually pretty good.  I've tried a few different enchiladas and they were are drool worthy.  Tried the vegetable chimichanga last time and it was excellent.  The rice is always so moist and fresh.  They have drinks specials daily and the basic margs are pretty good.

    "text": "The food gets three and a half stars. The service on the night we were there gets one star. The environment gets one star.  Temperature was about 87 degrees. Ceiling fans rotated, but we could not feel any air where we were sitting near the front window.   Salsa gets four stars. Chips get three, maybe four, because they were warm and the waitress kept bringing them as if she knew our food order would be late.  About an hour after the boys and I got there, we still didn't have our food. I had to go get my wife, who was working late, so we were up against a deadline. I asked that it be boxed to go.  Well, we left, late, sweating, and thoroughly disgusted. But fortunately, when we got home, the food tasted good.   I split a poblano chicken enchilada, rice, beans, and vegetables with my wife. It was very tasty. One of my sons had three tacos that he said were a good bit better (and more expensive) than what he was used to at Taco Bell. The other son had a shrimp dish that he ate about half of (portions are large, and he doesn't eat much at one sitting, especially after consuming copious quantities of chips!), so he liked it. He's picky.  So, here's my take: They had an \"off\" night for service. But they might be slow as a general rule, too. The place has a very tiny kitchen, a small bar with about 8 - 10 stools, about five or six booths, and about that many tables. I saw two waitresses, who were helping in the kitchen as well.  We got there about 6:10, and left about 7:20 with food in hand. When we arrived, it was busy. When we left, it was full. So folks were waiting a long time for their food.  The food is authentic, tastes good, and yields authentic gastrointestinal effects, typical of its type. But the wait was unexpected and unwelcome.  I may try it again when I have extra time, but time is something I have less and less of these days...  UPDATE: The manager read the review you just read, and emailed me that they did, in fact, struggle that night, with new personnel involved.   He apologized for the wait, and asked that we consider giving them another try. Kudos to him for being nice and humble. We probably will go back in a few weeks to check it out.",

The service can be hit or miss but most of the time very friendly, fast, and ready to help you. Their two entree combo with rice and beans is perfect. I always get a beef empanada and switch up the second choice each visit. Never had a problem with the food, except of course feeling too full to move. Their house Margarita is pretty good and sometimes the bartender has a heavy hand. Overall great food, experience, atmosphere and VERY reasonably priced. Highly recommend.",

The service was terrible and we will never return for the following reasons:  When we arrived the restaurant was packed.

Once my husband waived one lady down she responded without a smile, served us as though we were a bother to her. While we waited no one else said anything. Another couple comes inside. Immediately their drink order is taken and they are offered chips and salsa while they waited. We were offered nothing. No drink or chips. Next we were informed that our table was ready. But when we got up from the bar not one waitress showed to the table or where it was.So we were just standing there. We were seated. After that the service was ok. Others in the establishment seemed to get smiles and excellent service. But we did not.",

We were really pleased with the salsa, it was pretty standard. The rest of the meal was good, nothing to write home about but exactly what you would expect.

It seemed as if it was cooked earlier today and was reheated. This is probably why they served it so quick. They poured too much cheese over the burrito. We asked for guacamole and we got slices of avocado. They do not have unsweetened tea. The waitress was new and was friendly. According to the pictures I see here in yelp looks pretty good like the tacos. I'll probably give a second chance and try a different order.

    "text": "So, we finally got a chance to head back over to Three Amigos after our poor experience the first time. And needless to say, this trip wasn't any better service-wise. The only reason I'm not dropping to a 1 star is that the busboy was very helpful (and the only person on staff that we saw in the dining room for the majority of our time there).   Here's how our night went. We were seated immediately in a fairly full restaurant. It quickly became apparent that most of the tables were waiting for checks, so we figured we were starting off on the right foot. The fabulous busboy brought us our chips and salsa and waters. And we waited. And waited. And waited for a full 15 minutes before a server came over to take our order. I got the combo with a chicken taco and a chicken enchilada; my boyfriend got the enchiladas verde. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. The busboy (again) came and filled our waters and brought more chips. Then we waited some more. Until 35 minutes later when our food was delivered.   And after all that waiting the best food I had was the free salsa on the table. No joke. The free salsa with chips was the best thing I ate. We then had to flag the busboy (yes again) down to bring our check. I didn't even let him set it down before handing him my card to pay. I was done waiting. We then saw our waitress for the last time as she brought our check. I hardly recognized her. But I can tell you exactly what the busboy looks like and that he was working his bum off the whole time. If I'd had any cash I would have handed him the tip directly.  We will not be returning to Three Amigos. I'm honestly not pleased that I've now paid $50 for two meals and both were mediocre with some of the worst service I've had. Ever.",

    "text": "I'd like to give this place a 3.5, but for my initial review I'm going to have to leave it at 3/5 stars.  The location on Central Ave is pretty convenient, although this is too far east to still be in a nice and urban area like Plaza-Midwood. The shaded and verdant, albeit trash strewn, briar creek greenway is next door if you want to take a walk afterwards.  Some of the other reviewers claimed that the waitstaff hadn't yet mastered the English language, but I was disappointed to find that their English skills are impeccable (I wanted to practice \"mi Espanol!\").  The service is a little slow, but the servers were nice enough to make me feel relaxed enough to not want to hurry.    Another Yelper said that you need to ask for the picante salsa if you don't want the mild gringo stuff, but the one they brought me wasn't hot either and didn't taste good at all.  Kind of like taco bell's chipotle sauce but more burnt sandy taste.  The regular salsa was good and the chips were great.  Our neighbor's guacamole looked fantastic.  The tostada was fine, but not too special.  My GF really really liked the fajitas, which I also found tasty, but they were a little lacking in the fajita spice flavor that I was expecting.  She said that she only wants to eat fajitas from now on when she goes to a Mexican restaurant (so it does have the ability to please).  I also had an enchilada that was pretty good with pretty decent sauce too.  The best of all was the chimichanga which had a nice thin tortilla which made it so that it wasn't too oily or rich.  Combined with the meat and beans and queso fresco it was superb.  I could easily give this place more stars, but honestly it wasn't as good as I was hoping.  My collegiate years in San Diego have certainly spoiled me.   It's pretty tasty, reasonably priced, and has good enough service so I recommend checking it out.  But it's not quite as \"sabroso\" or \"rico\" as I was hoping.",

The carne asada was rich in flavor. The beans and rice are always delicious. The tacos are well made and the guacamole is also better than most.   The superstar at this place are the Enchiladas Verdes. The sauce for this dish is pretty much as good as it gets. It's a heft dish so bring your appetite.   Drink specials are usually great and the atmosphere is amazing. Again, bring your appetite bc this place is actually on point on pretty much all levels.",

    "text": "So i have a new friend in town from Texas.  We were in the mood for Mexican, however he said he wanted AUTHENTIC Mexican.  I had never been to Three Amigos but had seen the line out the door many times when I drive by.   After being super disappointed at a couple other competitors my last few visits, i suggested that we try this place.  we arrived at 6....and thankfully not a minute later because the  people started piling in....and there was LOTS OF THEM! .  We each had 2 margaritas. ...which set us up right.  Delicious and refreshing and provided a nice buzz.  Chips were pretty good and had Seasoning on them.  I like the fact that they serve their salsa in a deep bowl so you don't really run out quickly.  The salsa was not hot at all...however, the flavor was decent.   We both got the Mixed Fajitas with Chicken, Steak and shrimp.  Perfectly seasoned, not greasy at all, and a mountain of food.   YUM!  We also had a complementary Empanada from the Yelp app.  It was basically deep fried ground  beef and queso.  Had good flavor when it was hot.....but we had so much food at the table, i only ate a couple bites of it.    By the time we left....the restaurant was extremely packed with lots of people crowding the door which is by the bar...and everyone was getting their drink on.  But we never felt rushed to leave.  I will definitely go back for dinner here in the future....as it was authentic...and very good!  Been in CLT for 13 years .....hate ive not come sooner.",

    "text": "OMG!  I have a new favorite Mexican place in the QC!    This is a small place but what it lacks on space it makes up of food flavors!    My first experience here was actually a birthday celebration for fellow yelper, Chad E.  When I arrived the chips and salsas were already on the table along with homemade guac and pitchers of margaritas.    Three kinds of salsas ranging mild to spicy tickled my tastebuds.  The green one is the spiciest but my favorite was the smoky medium salsa. The guac was creamy with tomatoes mixed in.   Also arriving in time was the best queso I've ever experienced.  This queso was topped with onions and chorizo.    As a meal, at the recommendation of Tonya P, I ordered enchiladas.   Tonya recommended the Enchiladas verde but I went off on my own with the Enchiladas Entomatadas which sent my tastebuds into overload with chorizo.   The enchiladas are surprisingly light.  This was welcomed actually after the amount of food I had already consumed.  And we weren't finised.  On with dessert.....Some of everything, please?  Or at least that's what was ordered for all of those in attendance.  Churros with a strawberry ice cream.  Yummmmmmmmmmm.  Just the right amount of sugar coated these spanish donut-like sticks.  But then came the flan and this flan was the best I've tasted this side of the Atlantic.  And finally there was the tres leches cake which was extremely moist with a caramel cream icing.   So many amazing flavors.  Honestly, the worst thing I had here was the margarita and it's only because i haven't had alcohol other than beer in about a year and it gave me a headache.  Most people probably love the 'ritas here.    Seriously this is a 6-star place.",

Now I'm recommending you never go here unless you like roaches on your face or your food. After waiting for almost 2 hours to be seated we were given the worst service. I felt something crawling up my neck and I thought it was my hair a little to find out that it was a roach crawling on my face I flicked it off and screamed --immediately walking out of the restaurant disgusted!! After some time calming myself down outside. I walked back inside to get my money back and give them and ear full only to see another roach crawling up the wall. So there you have it. Good luck if you choose going here. When you go inside make sure you look up.",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Three Amigos Mexican Grill and Cantina located in the Midwood area of Charlotte. Dora here. You getting tired of Midwood yet? I'm not. :) This restaurant located in a small strip center provides an ideal location for a quick drop-in lunch or a family get-together for dinner.  As part of an online app promotion, we started with a free Beef Empanada, a pastry shell turnover made by folding dough over a filling, beef hamburger in this case, sealing it, and frying it.   This Empanada was great, fried golden brown, with a juicy filling including cheese. Dora here. And what a great start it was! Gooey cheese pocketed in the perfect crust.   For the meal, I ordered the Fajitas De Camaron, shrimp fajitas cooked with onions and green peppers served in a cast iron skillet along with sides of rice and refried beans, delivered to the table, sizzling. The shrimp and vegies were tender, but I would have liked more seasoning to bring out the flavor. Be prepared for ginormous portion sizes. If we'd known, we could've easily shared.  Dora here. So hubby knows that I usually order fajitas at Mexican restaurants. At his prodding to try something different (I find it interesting that he ordered fajitas, don't you? What's up with that? :) ) and the server's recommendation, I opted for the Bistec Encebollado, grilled steak with onions along with rice and refried beans. And tortilla shells, of course.  In my opinion, this tasted much like steak fajitas and I would've enjoyed it with a bit more zest as well. Other than that, the tortillas, both flour and corn, tasted like they were made on site and the beans and rice were good. Overall, the meal was pleasant.  I would rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.  Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

I still like this place, but here's why:  1. They have a lot of \"off\" food nights.  I can think of at least twice I came here, and my food was not very good.  The chips did not taste fresh, the salsa was bland, the meat tasted a little burned, and some of the food was WAY more spicy than usual.  2. The space is really cramped.  I am so glad it is busy there, but the space is so small in there.  The tables are very close together, and it's pretty loud all the time.   Despite these minor issues, I still enjoy this place.  They definitely still have some superbly tasty and strong margaritas, which I really enjoy.  And you can still get a tasty entree here for $8-12.  I have a feeling some of the issue is how much busier they've gotten in recent times.  I'd still give them a solid 3.5 stars.",

    "text": "Let me set the stage: I work in Fayetteville, live in Charlotte. I worked 72 hour nights in 6 nights, and it was my first day off. I slept for about 3 hours (until noon) and drove back sans coffee. I got home, completed a few errands and decided I didn't want to go grocery shopping or go out to eat because I felt exhausted. So, I scoured yelp to find a place to eat. I wanted to try the greek place, but their kitchen is being remodeled. So, I decided to order some street tacos and a trio dip from Three Amigos. The tacos looked (from the pictures) like something I would get from a Taco truck in California, which is a plus. She told me 10 minutes, not a problem. I gave them a bit more time because I was moving slow.   I drove to place, didn't see parking in the front and took a chance to drive around the back of the store (there is some parking back there). I walked my exhausted self into the restaurant and walked over to the bar area. The girl behind the bar went over to a take out bag, but I quickly noticed it wasn't my order, that she was restocking plasticware. No problem. I sat at the bar stool and waited to be acknowledged... Nothing... Then 2 other girls walked behind the counter. I was looking at the 3 of them, waiting to make eye contact and be acknowledged. One girl made eye contact with me for about 15 seconds, then walked away to continue doing whatever she was doing.  I just waited for them to finish what they were doing to acknowledge me, and ask if they could help me.... NOTHING. Then, 2 other girls walked into the restaurant and the initial girl behind the bar LOOKS PAST ME AT THEM and says, \"Two of you\".   I'm pretty forgiving and can put up with a lot, but being blatantly ignored and then passed over is not one of them. I'm not a scary looking person (although I was pretty exhausted and felt scary looking). So, I stood up, put my debit card back into my wallet, zipped it up and walked out. Still... unacknowledged.   Ironically, a friend was at Three Amigos and was shocked by my treatment. She recommended that I go to the Moroccan place next door, and I'm glad she did. You can see that review later, but let's just say they were super friendly, and I got my food super quick.",

The food was good as well, definitely not amazing by any means but very functional for that cheesy hangover cure I tend to get a craving for time and again.  Specials seemed pretty good too - $2 corona's on sundays and $2.50 on Mondays. They even have an all you can eat enchilada day during the week along with more pretty awesome drink specials.  All in all its a good restaurant with good food, if you want amazingly good mexican go somewhere like cantina or something like that.  If you want a good meal at a good price made by authentic mexican people you can't go wrong with Three Amigos.",

It happens so frequently that it makes me wonder if they do it on purpose. They can't be bothered with checking on you, refilling your drinks or offering a smile. I feel like I'm bothering them by being there. I order the same thing every time I go & order it the exact same way, but every time I go there's either extra ingredients on it or something is missing. The last time this happened & after I was lucky enough go get a waiters attention to tell her about it, I was told it depends on who makes it. Really? No point in reading the menu here ... You just have to hope that it's made correctly & if it isn't & you're brave enough to complain, get ready for attitude.

I have a HUGE appetite, but was only able to finish half of it. Although I've long said that La Unacia has the best tortas in town, I think this one is slightly better! My GF ordered the enchiladas rojas with cheese; the actual enchiladas themselves were fine (no better or worse than any other Mexican place), the SAUCE was simply AMAZING! It was so complex, it nearly mimicked the layered spices of Indian cuisine. We will absolutely come back, although the wait time for the food was a bit troubling: 35 minutes seems like a LONG time for a Mexican place!",

I'm a big dude and i can only eat 1/2 of it and take a shitload home. Staff has always been friendly and tho not speedy fast not as slow as some here indicate (seriously have you ever had lightening service at a mexican restaurant consistantly? If you've ever been to Mexico the pace is just a little slower than here and i think that feeds over)....I'd give it 7 stars if i could!!",

    "text": "As a fan of both cheap authentic Mexican and Enchiladas, I thought I would give this place a shot. First, it helps if you speak Spanish, because the menu is all in the native language. If not, you can figure out that pretty much everything comes with some variation of queso (cheese) and salsa/mole (sauce).  Yes, there are also traditional enchiladas and tacos and such, but I was more intrigued by the colorful new combinations.  I asked for the best of the chicken enchiladas, and they delivered. The meat was shredded well, and it meshed with the combination of salsa verda, cheese and avocado. A very green dish, and it didn't weigh me down afterward. A very nice price, too: $4.50.  The location and ambiance is nothing spectacular down on Central Ave. near the Vietnamese places, but it's a good place to try a spin on an old favorite for not that much money.",

    "text": "I came here for a late dinner on a Wednesday evening with the hubby and an out of town friend in tow.  I was already in a good mood after beer tasting at the common market and I figured this would be the perfect time to try out Three Amigos. I was already expecting a hole in the wall kind of place from all the reviews.  The dining area is set up much like a fast food restaurant with laminated plastic booths lining one wall and a few tables in the middle of the floor.  A quick glance at the number of customers gave me a boost of confidence that our food would come quick because we were all starving.  Unfortunately, the service was terribly slow.  It took quite a while to explain what we wanted to our waitress (she was baffled by the fact that I wanted a beer and my husband did not).  Once we came to an understanding we still had to wait for quite a while for our food to come out. The food was pretty good.  I got some chicken enchiladas with beans and rice.  The ingredients all seemed very fresh and the dish had just the right amount of spice to it (I like it hot!).  Everyone at the table seemed happy with their food. I want to come back and give them another try to see if the service is any quicker.  The quality of the food is definitely good for the price.",

    "text": "So, I went over to the place which is in my neighborhood - figuring even mediocre mexican food is still pretty good.  And that is pretty much what I got.  The food that I had was decent, not great not horrible, but very serviceable.  The chips with salsa were quite good, and they even broke out the spicy green salsa which was a good bit spicier but not as flavorful.  The tacos al pastor (marinated pork) were fine, but as is the case often with those tacos, a bit dry.  The sides of rice and beans gave me plenty to eat.  The beer was fine, and if I had known the dos equis was only 3 dollars a bottle I would have stuck with that rather than the negra modelo.  In terms of service, I sat at the bar and was well served by my waitress amoung others.  Everyone was quite friendly and helpful.  That said, the meal did take a loooong time to come out, especially from a not quite full restaurant.  They kept me happy with chips, salsa, beer and conversation so Im not complaining too much.  I really liked the casual but friendly vibe.  The prices are fine, but I didnt find them to be ridiculously cheap as another poster said.  I am new to charlotte but would pay the same type of price in any taqueria in brooklyn.  So, overall it wasnt a memorable experience, but even still it was alright and Ill probably be back to try some other plates since it is in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "I would have to agree with everyone else's reviews...this place is incredible. Hands down the best Mexican fare in Charlotte. I had only driven past it a thousand times before I looked it up on Yelp and couldn't believe the reviews for this hole in the wall cantina! We ordered take out and picked it up with high hopes.  Needless to say, we weren't disappointed in the least! The food was fresh, hot, and most importantly, delicioso. I think every single employee said hello to me when I walked in the door and they had my food ready and waiting when I got there (10 minutes after ordering). I had been told that the green salsa was something you wouldn't get without asking for, so I mentioned it when I went in to pick it up. They gladly got me a few cups of it and put it in with my other food. WOW! So GOOD! It surprises you with a crazy after-burn, but the taste is crazy good. My only complaint...they forgot the chorizo in our cheese dip last time. I hesitate to even mention it, b/c everything else was so great, but I have to say I was pretty sad when I opened our cheese dip like a kid on Christmas morning and the main attraction was missing. I told myself it was my fault for ordering later in the evening & forgot all about it.  Two more key points...It's only been a week since our first experience and we just placed another take out order. Second, about 2 days after our maiden T.A. voyage, a co-worker of mine felt compelled to pull me aside at work and tell me to run, not walk to this tiny little mexican joint in Plaza Midwood that she had discovered. I smiled and told her I had already found it. Do yourself a favor...check it out.",

Our town does a disservice to what this style of food is really about. We have no 5 stars here and maybe a 4, somewhere (message me if you know)  Three Amigos...all about the Mole enchiladas and the peppery salsa...neither are truly authentic but they are the best in town. Tacos are bland and fajitas are slightly above Charlotte avg. The staff are friendly with a familial feel, but service is hit or miss.   Overall, disappointment comes from expectations. In Charlotte, if you expect Mexican food to be a let down, then you might be surprised at Three Amigos with some tasty, but not-quite-exceptional food and service at a decent price.",

The reason I gave this place 5 stars is because they have the best chips in town and everything I've gotten here has been excellent.  Even though the loaded fries were not my favorite, I set a very high bar for my loaded fries, this is still a great place to get them compared to many others.  (After all, I can't just give my 1 favorite loaded fries to that restaurant...no other restaurant will ever get 5 stars if that's the case!).

We waited a while for them to seat 5 of us and service was a little slow even thought they weren't busy.   The margaritas are really good. I ordered a large not realizing how big it would be, so it was definitely worth the money. The food was decent and the portions are really big. We all ordered from the lunch menu, but they charged me $3 extra just for shredded beef instead of ground beef which they didn't tells me about beforehand. I don't think I'd make the trip back but it was good for a one time experience.",

The food had absolutely NO flavor at all we all decided on different things and everything was bland and flavorless. This is a very far cry from Authentic Mexican food.   The rice had no flavor  The refried beans had an unpleasant texture and also had no flavor.  The tortillas tasted store bought.  If you have had real Mexican food this will highly disappoint.",

    "text": "Because I love great Mexican food and margs, the fella and I had date night here last Friday night. Three Amigos was super packed and busy, but it was all worth the wait!  The space is quite small, and they could easily double their size/seating and still have a full house. We put our names on the list and ordered the house margaritas at the bar while waiting. BE WARNED - the margaritas are fishbowl and are mostly alcohol with a dash of marg mix. This is a pleasant-ish surprise considering most places chintz on the booze. However, I thought it was a little too strong and was glad that we had taken an uber after one sip of it.  Thankfully we just needed a table for two and were able to be seated relatively quickly. Groups of 4+ that were ahead of us had to wait much longer, so I recommend coming with a small number or during off-peak hours.  The guac, queso, and salsa are all really fantastic. I believe my entree was good too, but by the time I finished margarita #1 and started on #2 my taste buds were numbed. I really liked that Three Amigos serves GOOD rice and beans paired with most entree dishes!  Definitely would consider coming back for takeout or more margaritas. Rock on!",

Our waiter Christian came to us with this positive energy and sat us down. We're off to a great start. I asked what's good on the menu and he gave us his opinion and he made us feel excited to get our food cause he made it sound so delicious. Well he was RIGHT!! The fajitas were DELICIOUS! I ordered a drink as well (the house margarita) and that was amazing as well! After that amazing experience with the food and especially our waiter Christian I will definitely be coming back again! If you have not been here I will recommend checking it out and try to get Christian! Best service and literally made my day!",

Another family comes in to bar and immediately their order is taken they are given menus, drinks, chips, etc. The same waitress who I told i needed to order asks her male coworker in Spanish, \"anybody help this lady????\" So he finally takes my order 3rd - food lacks seasoning, very bland. The empanada was delicious but the burrito, beans, and rice weren't the least bit flavorful.  All in all ...I won't be back. Bad customer service, felt discriminated, and bland food",

Tucked away in the Plaza Midwood on Central Av, this restaurant is a less than a 10min drive from downtown/uptown. Ambiance is a not really a thing for most of the restaurants on Central Av, owing to the limited space I guess so. The restaurant had a couple of booths and tiny tables. I am an average person at about 160lbs and the small booth was pretty cramped for me. The menu was regular Mexican with not much house specials or interesting innovations. The only surprising thing on the menu was it had an \"All day breakfast\". I have hardly known any Mexican restaurants in Charlotte serving breakfast menus!   While We ordered some Fajitas, Quesadilla, Empanadas and Chimichanga, we were given chips and Salsa. The chips were fresh and tasted so much better and the salsa was a die for! The dishes came in after a short wait while they were still smoking hot! The quantity was lavish and not too overwhelming. The food tasted heavenly! Everything from the mexican rice, beans and even pico had so much flavor to them and were not bland. We truly enjoyed a good Mexican dinner!   I would recommend Three Amigos to all Amigos looks for good tasty Mexican food without puncturing your wallets. I would have given 5 stars but the ambiance and the small tables were a let down.",

The restaurant is very small and dive-ish which is kinda cool. I've had servers that were decent, but this past Friday night our server was horrible. She forgot the queso we ordered, our beers, and left us without water refills for way too long (which is just cruel when you're eating spicy salsa!)  The quality of the food is simple. It's definitely NOT hyper-processed and packaged... but it's not super fresh and top of the line either.  There's not a lot of vegetarian things listed on the menu, but they can alter most of the options to be veggie friendly by substituting zucchini, onions, and tomatoes. No special seasonings with the veggies, just chopped and seared. I don't like the refried beans. I do like the chips and salsa. The mole sauce is good.  On the whole, I might come here again, but Three Amigos is far from my first pick of Mexican fare. Thumbs up for being local and NOT a chain. But thumbs down for terrible service when they're busy and boring food.",

Sucks that we were already halfway there otherwise I would've taken that as a hint to not bother. I honestly don't know how they were able to take our order, give us a total of the order,  and not have it or know about it.

The food however not so much. The chips we were served were cold but flavorful and the salsa was very bland. We ordered the nachos with chicken as an appetizer. Once again there was a lack in flavor but the pulled chicken was tender and moist. For my main dish I had the chicken burrito, taco, and beans and rice. The taco, beans and rice were decent. The burrito was made with refried beans inside which threw me off, and it lacked flavor. My dining companion had the fish tacos which he said also lacked flavor. Overall I was left underwhelmed. The food was nothing to rave about. I would return for the margarita I had, which was made perfectly, but not for the food.",

    "text": "Enchiladas Poblanas are the reason I keep coming back.  They are delicious, as is the guac.    I thought I'd share this Charlotte gem with coworkers today and have to say that the takeout experience is NOT a good one.  It's Saturday, we're having to work, so we wanted a good lunch.  We ordered, what we thought, were orders of lunch enchiladas as well as a large guace, queso fundido, and chips and salsa. Drove the 20 minutes one-way to pick up the lunch and were charged for full, dinner portions.  It was 12:15 in the afternoon, website clearly states 10:30-2:30 lunch specials on their menu.    Asked the girl checking me out why we were charged so much for lunch and she explained that they don't offer lunch specials on Saturday.  Fair enough, great for future reference, but I asked them to honor the lunch special rates as they website does not have any specifications and I wasn't going to pay the extra for my office.    She was super nice and offered to check with someone (manager I presume) and came back and said they would honor it.  Great! Awesome service.    However, they had to re-do our orders so she took them to the back and I guess they changed them to lunch portions, as they came back out in smaller boxes (no rice/beans, just three enchiladas).  That's fine, I don't care if we get what we pay for, but I'm on a lunch break  time crunch.  Again, she was very pleasant throughout the process, it just seemed silly to waste the food, boxes, and my time.   I get back to my office and deliver lunches to everyone.  We have one bag of chips, one brown paper lunch bag of chips.  We ordered a LARGE ($8!!!) guacamole, a Queso Fundido ($5) and chips and salsa.  I wasn't aware that I had to order \"Chips and Guac\", \"Chips and Queso\", etc.  in order to get enough for those portions of dips.    Very disappointing to have a large container of the tastiest guac, but nothing to eat it with.  Food is good.  Service is spotty but today was great. Deals/promos are shady and/or unclear.  Value is bad.",

    "text": "We had stopped by another Mexican place wanting something authentic, but they were closed, so we went off on a hunt for \"somewhere else\".  We ended up at La Casa de Las Enchiladas.  I am so glad that we did.  Most everything else that you need to know has already been said: The English is good, but a bit broken and a few words don't make it through.  Be patient and you'll be fine.  The menu has lots of pictures, but it is also mostly in Spanish (there is English towards the back).  Point, have patience and you'll be fine here as well.  You can get Coca-Cola in a bottle, and though I can't tell you that it's the Mexican variety made with sugar cane, it's definitely possible.   They also have Jarritos and another Apple soda drink that seems interesting (I didn't try it on this trip however).  Service is friendly, the food is good.  Chips especially were some of the best I have had - at some places you get chips that taste like they've been sitting out for hours (or days), but here they all taste fresh.  The salsa is good too.  We had the carne asada, which was a solid choice.  But ultimately, my money is on the mole poblano enchiladas.  I'm not usually a fan of mole, but this was just incredible and quite possibly some of the best Mexican that I've had in Charlotte.  After the first bite I was trying to figure out how I could lick the plate so as to not leave any.  The only downside?  The atmosphere could be a bit better.  I don't mind a location in a strip mall - anyone who has read my reviews should know that.  The seating was actually comfortable.  But the lighting was pretty harsh, and I frequently found that I was trying to cover my eyes to not have to be blinded by them.  A little work there would do wonders, and gain them the coveted fifth star.  The neighborhood is also not the best (somewhat outside of Plaza Midwood), but it's not bad at all, and sometimes you just have to bite the bullet in order to get to the good stuff.  In any case, it's well worth the visit.",

    "text": "Three Amigos is special for several reasons:  1.) You can tell that everything here is made from scratch from the best ingredients they can source because everything is absolutely delicious. Chips are on the house, but try them with a side of Guacamole, it is the best I've ever had! For the 1st two years after I discovered this place, all I ate were the Enchiladas Poblanas. I LOVE Mole, in fact, Mole Poblano is the national dish of Mexico and is very intricate and difficult to make, but Three Amigos kicks its butt! The flavors that come out of their mole are so intricate and layered. It is such a perfect combination of spicy, sweet, salty and tart that you cannot actually taste those individual flavors because it just becomes this whole new amazing combined flavor that should have its own name! Lately though, I have been addicted to their Quesadilla de Lengua, or Tongue Quesadilla. I know the thought of tongue scares some people, but in Mexico, Central, and Latin American we have been cooking with it forever, and Three Amigos has it down to an art. There is no other cut of meat that I can think of that can have such a tender texture. If you do not want to commit your whole meal to tongue, order a tongue taco on the side, and you will never look back. Also, on Fridays and Saturdays from 10pm-4am they serve a Dominican menu. It is all greasy, delicious, Dominican street type food and if you've had a little too much to drink I cannot think of a better place to get something to eat and sober up!  2.) I discovered Three Amigos about 3 years ago, when you barely saw any Americans in there, and it was fantastic. A short while later they put out some daily deals and to say the least, word spread like wildfire. Unfortunately, in my experience, when such a significant spike in demand takes place some restaurants get overwhelmed and start cutting corners and buying pre-made ingredients. I was very worried that this was going to happen to my beloved Three Amigos, but if anything, the opposite took place. They rose up to the challenge and continued to do what made them famous in the first place, and that is to serve authentic and delicious Mexican food in an incredibly friendly environment.  3.) The final thing that makes Three Amigos special is the fact that aside from serving delicious food, they go out of their way to help customers create unforgettable memories. I've had a couple of birthdays here and my husband and I had our joint Bachelor/Bachelorette pre-party dinner here exactly a year ago and Three Amigos is not only accommodating, but they go above and beyond any expectations that you may have. I dream to one day own a restaurant like this, that is not only adored and remembered for the food, but also for the memories they helped create!",

I always order enchiladas (mixtas) so I really can't vouch for many other items but they are so good I feel no need to try anything else. I do not do this at any other restaurant and do admit it is lame.  It is 4 enchiladas with four different sauces and I always finish with the mole (it's my dessert). I also always order them with steak because I love the seasoning and it always comes with a little piece of bonus steak on the plate. The chips seem like the fryer may need to be turned up because they always have a little residual greasiness to them. The Mexican Coke and  Victoria beer are always cold and delicious. The service is always pleasant and entertaining. The music can be very inappropriate (Lil Jon Shots- YouTube it) but I find it HILARIOUS!! The Moby look-a-like across from me did not and insisted on his food to go. He looked like a hipster but was apparently wound a little tighter than his horn rims, Apple, tattoos, and  Indy Rock shirt conveyed. Without a doubt I will be back for my dose of rap and enchiladas.",

The food is OK, but that's coming from someone who LOVES Mexican food so I'm always wild about everything because how can you not love any and everything Mexican? This is where the problemo lies - theyr'e just not doing anything great at Three Amigos. I got the taco salad and in the past have tried the enchiladas verde, nachos and fajitas and all are - eh. The bathrooms - ick! They get less attention that the tables, so needless to say on busy nights they're not visions of cleanliness.  Part of me just wants to love all over some Three Amigos because I love East Charlotte and love Mexican food and love establishments that love Yelp, but Three Amigos, I sadly will say adios and go to you no longer.",

I'm giving it a solid 4 stars.   It's literally been a year since I have made a return visit because frankly I always left this place disappointed. Not a fan of their tacos (though I admit the tongue is pretty tasty even though not my personal thing) and I'm a taco fanatic which is a big reason. The other is that the wife and I always split plates and invariably we get one good dish and the other one not so much. Have long been in search of the perfect meal here until....  Ok, so not perfect, but pretty damn good is what I got last night. The key was that both entrees nailed it, and you guessed it - I didn't force the tacos for the one thousandth time. This place has some bangin' good mole sauce so I went with the enchiladas pablanas which were unbelievable; the lady went with the chilaquiles verde and this dish also nailed it with an egg on top cooked to perfection. And did I tell you about the mole (even I can make good tacos... Good mole, well that takes talent)? Granted there were some less than stellar items (the guacamole used some under ripe avocados and the tacos dorados appetizer was a waste of calories) but with two entrees like that and a cold Modelo, who really cares?  Glad I gave this place another try and I guarantee it won't be a year before I'm back again!",

I'm going to tell you about the last time I went there..I ordered  over the phone and got there and had to wait about 10 minutes for my food which was fine. I saw they had tres leches and I wanted one but I wanted to see what it looked like first because I like milk in mine hence 3 milks! I asked a guy working there if I could see one and he brought one to me and when I opened it I saw a dusty ass dry piece of cake with the thinnest layer of icing with NO milk! So I politely declined. This employee literally snatched it out of my hand and violently threw it in trash as if I touched it or something then he called me a stupidass in Spanish. I do speak a little bit. But he continued to say things about me to the other employees. Like I said I could understand some of it. I definitely would've gotten the manager but I had other things to attend to after that. But for this experience I will never go back and spend my money there.",

But there is control to the chaos! What I would really love is a Three Amigos expansion!   The space is somewhat compact. You open the door and you're right at the bar. There's really not too much room to stand and wait for a table. But they really make things work with what they got. Their takeaway happens right at the bar as well.   The food is delicious and they give you plenty to eat! I've ventured all across the menu and have never been disappointed. Make sure you go for that queso to start off with too! On nice days they have a patio set up where you can dine outside too. Overall an excellent Mexican restaurant where you can have your cravings fulfilled.",

We both got the pick 3 with taco, enchilada and gorditas. All of the items were piping hot and tasted delicious. They put a lot of queso on top which is a huge plus in my book. I got the pork, shredded beef,  and shredded chicken. I was happy with all 3. Great beans and rice. Prices are great and portions are huge- I was able to make a big lunch out of my leftovers the next day.   The one downside was the service. We were in on a Wednesday night and the place was busy. Maybe they weren't expecting the rush, but everything took a long time. We didn't get greeted/drinks ordered/chips/salsa for a very long time. The server never refilled waters and also forgot to bring the guacamole we ordered for our chips. Aside from the service, food was great!",

I have ordered this hundreds of times at dozens of mexican cantinas and restaurants but until tonight, I don't think I've ever really had it. Beyond awesome. The sauce was what made it. Deep and very flavorful. Spicy but not overpowering. And best of all, there was definitely a hint of mole' in this sauce which made it absolutely perfect.

The food comes out FRESH (hot off the grill) The only tiny thing my sister didn't like was their horchata... It's too milky. But the waitress swapped it right out.  Even their chips and salsa were really good!  I can't believe I've lived on this side of town for so long and didn't know about this hidden gem.  Will definitely be back!!!

This place doesn't compare to home but it does come pretty close. I really enjoyed the food and it was fulfilling. I ordered enchiladas verde. The food came out hot and fresh. The only thing that I didn't really like was the horchata drink. Horchata generally doesn't have milk in it but the one made here tasted a bit milky. Overall, I would recommend this place if you're searching for good Mexican food. I left satisfied :)",

On one hand it was frickin fantastic but on the other, I've been in Charlotte for five years and never experienced this place before--what gives?   I try not to judge a book by it's cover but sometimes you got to with restaurants and looking at Three Amigos, I really didn't expect much. I drove up and asked myself \"Is this the right Three Amigos?\" and as soon as other Yelpers came in, realized I got the right one.  What can I say that others haven't? Probably not much but the highlights *Mexican Coca-Cola-this stuff rivals McDonald's Coca-Cola (aka the best Coke in the world) *Tortilla chips fried to perfect with a bit of seasoning on them *Guacamole so smooth and creamy that I wanted to break out some Gerardo and start singing \"Rico Suave\" *Meals that could feed a small nation. Seriously. I ordered the chilaquiles verde with two fried eggs and feel like I could do some bicep curls with my leftover box.  *Cheap prices. Said plate that could feed a nation was $5.99. What the hell?? I love it and again, sad that I haven't been going to Three Amigos all along. *Friendly staff and owner--they kept stopping by, making sure everything was to our liking--the service couldn't have been more spot on *People watching. Oh yes, it was good.  Now if they would have cardboard figures of Chevy Chase, Steve Martin and Martin Short-I would be in heaven.   Te amo Three Amigos!!",

So, recently when I dined in for the first time for Chad's suprise party, I discovered that they have good service here as well.   This place is on the small side but popular and known for good food, so even on a weeknight, the place is busy. Still, even as busy as they were, our servers took really good care of us and really hustled.   My favorites here included the Chicken Empanadas, chips & salsa, jalapeno salsa,   queso fundido, and churros.  I was not a big fan of their guacamole - too much onion for my taste.   For my entree, I ordered the Enchiladas Poblanos - which consisted of 3 tortillas filled with chicken and  Mexican Mole Poblano sauce topped with cheese & sour cream.  This was served with beans & rice.  Sadly, the mole was not the most delicious that I have ever eaten, but it was ok.  I probably will order something different next time I am here.   I thought the rice was a bit on the bland side and I am not a huge fan of refried beans.  Next time I will probably skip these items.  I also tried a bite of the Chicken Enchiladas Verde. It had a bit too much onion for my taste, so I probably wouldn't order this dish here next time either.   But, they have plenty of other options, so next time I visit, I will definitely check out some of their other offerings.   The prices are very reasonable here, our bill for 2 entrees was under $20 before tip.",

    "text": "Okay I am torn about this review. I ordered shrimp tostadas (2 of them), tacos de carne asada, and a small chicken yarao. Okay so the total came out to $27.32. So the shrimp tostadas was absolutely delicious. The carne asada was burnt, and the yaraoa was so yummy. Here is the part that I do not like. After I did the math the total should have not been that much. I spoke with the manager and I told them the prices was higher than I thought, she repeated the price to me which is $2.95 for each taco carne de asada, $6.49 for the small Yaroa, and $4.95 for each shrimp tostadas. Also just for informational purposes I asked her how much a plate of Shrimp Tostadas would be instead of la carte. She said $12.95. On the website for a tacos a la carte, the price is $2.49, the price for the Yaroa is $5.95, and the price for a plate of shrimp tostada is $10.59.  I told her the prices do not reflect that on the website. She then asked did I make sure I was on the correct three amigos website, since they have several locations. I said yes it specifically says the address is Central Avenue location on top right corner. She thanked me for addressing it. Here is where I am annoyed , they should have rectified the situation. They could have also easily gone on their website on their phone to see that the prices were reflected differently. So for all of those that place to go orders, double check the prices in which they rang you up and what is posted on their website. I highly doubt I am the only one that has noticed this or brought it to their attention. We are living in the digital age and whatever prices you put on your website is what you should honor. Please just update your website and make sure the prices are correct. I included screenshots below so the owner and manager can see , yes I know how to use the Internet and the website I pulled up was in fact theirs and that I was not lying. Your website does not have the correct updated prices listed on there.",

The margaritas are delicious are they are BIG.  I could be imagining this, but it feels like the menu has changed over the years and become less focused on enchiladas than it used to be. Regardless, the food is delicious. The kitchen, however, can be very slow. If they are busy, it is quite possible that you'll be waiting for a bit for your food. The last few times I ate there, I took 90% of my meal home bc I was full on chips, queso, and guac by the time it arrived. Not all Mexican/Latin American food reheats well, so this is something to keep in mind.  ***I have Celiac Disease, and I'm happy to report that I've never gotten sick at Three Amigos.***",

    "text": "Jalapeno Sauce the consistency of Mustard!  This Sauce gets Five stars for flavor!  Be careful this is pretty HOT!  We were adding this to every dish only in small quantities.  Lets start at the beginning!  My Amazing new Girlfriend likes Mexican food, might be her favorite food so when I asked POPROCK LOVE for a place the five of us could meet for a early Labor Day Dinner, she chose this place without hesitation - I have been wanting to check this place out!  My Girlfriend and I arrive and POPROCK LOVE and her Husband had a table for all of us...This is a fun place to meet friends and hang out!  We had a taste of a non-Margarita Drink (not not,mic mic, nick knack know what it is called) Grapefruit juice? Something?  It was good!  Good enough that one taste cured me!  If you think that is funny you should have been there when it happened, if you do not think it is funny read again and check your sense of humor, It's funny!   The Chips were Exceptional and the Salsa was very good!  I'm usually not a fan of much Guacamole, Guac seems too mild for me, yet I like the oiliness of it!  This Guac with a little of the Jalapeno Sauce was good enough that I bet everyone else at the table was wishing they had invited my Girlfriend to eat without me.. I ate more of it than the next two people combined and I was not hungry! Great start! !  !   My Girlfriend got something like an Enchilada and something like a Taco.  I liked the \"Taco\" better... Since we have not been dating that long and Mexican is not a cuisine that I am that familiar with, I wanted to eat what she ordered... One of our friends who will remain nameless (you can call him Alejandro from Ecuador and he is from Ecuador) gave me half of his meal (something like delicious PORK wrapped in a soft shell with Onions and Cilantro) This was VERY, Very Good!  Is it a Hole-in-the-Wall?  Kinda, Not to me, because it is plenty Clean though about what you would expect for the address!",

It's a small establishment with bar seating and plenty of booths to sit at. We got the jumbo margarita to start ( cause it's 5 somewhere right?! ).   Chips came out within minutes hot with a great seasoning. The salsa had lots of flavor thin but with lots of tomatoes and onions! Delicious.   We ate from the lunch specials Menu. I got the enchiladas verdes. Which are a steal! It came with the green sauce. Three big enchiladas with chicken. So filing! I took one home. The hubby enjoyed a burrito with rice and beans and he cleaned his plate!  Service was great and it was a affordable but great meal! They have specials for drinks on most days & Friday's have specials on Margarita's. Also don't forget to check in! You get a free queso dip, we forgot but even more reason to come back right?!",

    "text": "Everybody knows, when you move to a new city you've got to find some standard staples. So, off we went to find an authentic Mexican restaurant in town.   This place is located in a Midwood shopping center with huge singage you cannot miss.   When we arrived several parties were waiting outside! To my surprise our wait was only 15-20 min, great! Note: this place is TINY.   Once our table was ready (our party of 3) was seated (middle of the restaurant and walkway). In the future, I'd ask to wait a little longer for a booth as those are really the ONLY seats that's aren't inconvenient. The bar and tables do not allow for much moving around and people are constantly moving and hovering over your food and drinks.   DO checkin on the yelp app first for a coupon (ours was free queso with the purchase of two drinks and two entrees).  The chips are great, the salsa is meh and the queso came to the table Luke warm. You know Queso needs to come hot or it becomes thick and blockish.   The shrimp fajitas are GREAT and I'd absolutely come back for that! My husband said the pick 3 was great (burrito + 2 tacos), however, he'd recommend you do not add the rice and beans to the burrito since it already comes with that. Your stomach and bathroom will thank you for this tip later!   BTW they offer tiered margaritas and I ordered a standard house margarita. Take my advice and don't. Level up if you know what I mean.",

What's good: I liked my mole enchiladas (good sauce flavor and chicken), excellent top shelf margaritas (would they have been as good not top shelf?), warm chips and good dip to start, solid tacos  What's not as good: tacos are super messy (get napkins early), burritos not great (just chicken and some rice in a burrito - that's it), outside service (I get it, it's hot, who sits outside, but we got forgotten quite a bit)  Again solid in some ways but not amazing. We will likely be back to try some things again but nothing to write home about. Staple Mexican cuisine.",

Currently, it's for free queso (meal purchases are required).   I love their ground beef. No matter what vessel I am getting, ground beef is always my protein here. I usually get a burrito (because it's covered in queso, duh). I'll sometimes change it up and get tacos instead. If you like spicy, make sure to ask for the green salsa. It's so good.  They have great specials throughout the week. There's basically a beer special every day. On Fridays, the big margs are on special for just $5.99.. Thursdays, they do All You Can Eat Enchiladas (beef or chicken with rojo, verde, or poblano sauce).  It's not the biggest place, so there's not a ton of tables. They do have a small bar as well where you can sit.  Note on to-go orders: they no longer come with free chips and salsa. You will have to order and pay for them. Worth it. Do it. I usually order extra salsa.",

The restaurant is very small and does not have a lot of seating, so expect to get there early or wait if you come during meal times.   I came here on a Friday night with friends and we had to wait only a few minutes to be seated, but we got there before 6pm. The service was very good and our server made sure if there was positivity in his interactions. We all had margaritas, which are GIANT and delicious!   I ordered empanadas and an arepa. The empanadas were flavorful and amazing, definitely recommend! The arepa was an open face taco and I probably wouldn't recommend ordering if you are \"trying something new\" because it lacked flavor/wasn't anything special. The meal deals come with a side and I opted for beans and rice.   The parking lot was smaller, but we had no issues finding parking. The bathroom situation is a single stall unisex bathroom near the kitchen.",

We were also a big table of six and they were able to accommodate us pretty easily with one of their front tables.  There are a couple of booths, but I feel like they can turn a table over pretty quickly.  The dining room is small and it was packed (as ti should be).  You can tell this spot has figured out their regulars and are a well-oiled machine at this point.  The maragarita came in a HUGE heavy, margarita glass and salted rim.    The staff, were running around, but they were friendly and made sure we had chips and water refills to our hearts desire.    Overall a great place.  The front  of the building is pretty meek and unassuming, but it cranks out some flavorful, fun food.",

Our food came out very fast. I got a carne asada burrito with al pastor tostada which came with rice and beans. The burrito was covered in cheese sauce. The tostada was maybe a taco instead and sat on a bed of lettuce so it wouldn't get soggy from the cheese sauce (great idea!). The al pastor was very tender and tasty. The burrito had very little meat and was filled with rice and beans. Kind of redundant with the rice and beans that came with my combo plate. My husband got a cabeza torta and it was huge! Bread and meat ratio could have used more meat.   I'd come back for tacos. Meat was tasty but the taco was probably the best meat/carb ratio.",

Besides chimichangas, their empanadas are the best. Now, I do not know if adding cheese to empanadas are actually authentic, but I prefer empanadas have cheese. Theirs do and I approve.  I have also eaten their arroz con pollo.  Once again, on point. My wife usually does a burrito or the diablos Camarones. They are both good. Now I preferred the location they had in northern Charlotte, but unfortunately I do not have that choice anymore. However, the original location is still winning.  I was not much of a fan of Mexican food prior to trying 3 Amigos, however 3 Amigos was my True gateway into Mexican cuisine. Through them I have tried a number of places and have become a convert. However, I gotta give 5 stars to the OG.",

We got there around 5 and were seated right away.   They give you complimentary chips and salsa which is always a plus. I heard good things about the enchiladas, so I decided to get the enchiladas mixtas to try them all. I loved them all, but the poblanas was definitely my favorite. My husband got the naked fajitas with steak and really liked them as well.   The service was very good and very fast. If we had ordered right away we probably could have been done in half an hour.   This is now my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend doing so!",

The restaurant and parking lot is small, but don't let that turn you away. The restaurant is always clean and the staff is always friendly.  They start off by giving you chips and salsa. The salsa isn't too spicy if that's your thing. You also get a free queso when you check in, so what's not to love about that!   I always get a margarita that has the right amount of tequila to make you feel great! The drink tastes so fresh and not like they use some type of margarita mix.  Now the food! I always get a chicken quesadilla. The quesadilla comes with rice and beans and an avocado is on top of the quesadilla ! The quesadilla comes with your choice of meat, lettuce, onions, and cheese. It's amazing!   I prob could eat there once a week!",

Hole in the wall Mexican food with no frills that you can't stop dreaming about the second you're not full again.   Obviously, my stars are all for the food. This isn't the kind of place you _want_ to want to come to. But you do anyway.   It's small and cramped and dark and there's nothing fancy about it. They have a yelp check-in special that they struggle to honor (took my phone and three people four check-ins to figure out how to redeem a queso which was such an affair I told them forget it I'll just buy the trio-appetizer anyway). A server dropped (our) dirty silverware into the hoard of people waiting by the door and paused for a second looking at it, then just walked away. We were asked how we wanted to split the check which was nice. They had struggled to understand \"put it anywhere\" for people sharing appetizers and entrees. Guess family style isn't welcome here.   But everything was good. The enchiladas, the Gordita, the empanada, the veggie burrito was amazing, the plantains, the tostada, the crazy queso--all good. The guac had too many BIG chunks of onion but was still ok.   Will I be back? Yeah, definitely. Maybe at off-peak hours or for take-out in the future, though.",

The quality of food wasn't fantastic, but you could tell it was being made in the kitchen. I had the chicken tinga, which was not exactly tasteless, but nothing really stood out. There was a lot more liquid then I'm accustomed to with the dish. My lovely dining companion had the carne asada. Is there a more well known Mexican restaurant menu staple? Unfortunately, it had marinaded far too long and the meat was insanely tough. It was very close to moist beef jerky in texture. She sent almost all of it back. No reaction at all from the server when she took the plate, which almost looked the same as when she delivered it from the kitchen 20 minutes earlier.   Won't be back to this place again.",

Once, I don't remember clearly but the faint memories was delicious! At late night though, they only serve Dominican sandwiches. No worries though, they're delicious.  I had a nice house margarita and an awesome 'Rickis' sandwich. The cabbage gave it a crunch which differs from the other sandwich. The 'Churris ($5)' instead has one beef patty instead of ground beef and onions. I tried the 'Churris' last time I was there and faint memories said that it was amazing, but then again I will have to try it sober to remember the exact details.  I will definitely come back more often, because it's just a great place to just hang out. Not that many people come through so it's quiet to talk. Most likely though, I'll be coming here after the club before I go home.",

I love Mexican food, and a lot of Mexican spots don't serve pollo en mole which is surprising, you must try it! The tacos are always good, and the tortas are better than most other places.

There's usually enough for me to have some for lunch the next day.   The mole sauce for the enchiladas is delicious, too.   I generally go for a Modelo or a Dos XX, but the house margarita is popular with all of my friends.   Heads up: the restaurant is small and can get crowded. Last time I was here was a Saturday at 2:30 and there were only two open tables. Order a drink at the counter and wait. Or, if you're in a rush, call ahead and order takeout and eat chips and salsa at the bar while you wait.",

Unappetizing presentation.  But even so, the quality of the food and care with which it was prepared was lacking. Worst tacos al pastor I've ever had. The pork had little flavor, was disgustingly fatty, and the tortillas were torn and shredded. Also, no pineapple-y sauce or anything. Just some cilantro and onions. Very dry.   Chicken enchiladas verde were unrecognizable in the sloppy mess of a box they arrived in. Good flavor for the chicken. But sloppy mess of lettuce and sour cream on top made it taste more like tortilla soup than an enchilada. And again, the tortillas were ripped.   Next up the chicken tacos. Again, just a sloppy mess of lettuce and cheese and sour cream.   Finally the guacamole. Nice and chunky and fresh. But absolutely no flavor. No zing. No salt. Just bland.   Good homemade chips though.   If the food showed up like this for carry out or at the table I'd be giving a 1. Giving some benefit of the doubt for delivery issues. But this establishment should figure out how to prepare its food for delivery if they continue to use a delivery service. Maybe items that make the food soggy should go on the side?  But also, its Mexican food and should have some flavor, right!?",

However, I have to say I was very disappointed with this place.  The food was very bland, looks like it is re-heated and definitely not cooked to order, as it came out almost instantly.  Also, the service is really miserable.  The waitress was probably about the most unfriendly I have encountered at any restaurant in Charlotte.  She looked like she was angry at me the moment I walked in the door.  I can see she was a bit overworked, but a smile and a bit of friendliness would be nice.  She also got my order wrong the first time and didn't give me any napkins or silverware until after the meal came.   However, the chicken was tough and stringy and Mole sauce tasted like it came out of a can.  I can probably cook better enchiladas than the ones I got and even Taco Bell is not too much a step down.    The food is fairly cheap, although I think the quality of the food still is hardly worth the cheap price.",

The Cheese dip was very bland and very runny so I don't recommend that. The salsa was decent. I have enchiladas that again, we're OK but nothing go make them stand out and my fiancee had fiatas that were the same story. The service was really slow. We were in the restaurant for nearly 2 hours (not including our wait time) and our drinks ran empty several time and I just feel like we were placed on the back burner. But all in all, good enough for a 3 star I suppose...... Until this morning when we both woke up running to the bathroom.  It's definitely extremely rare for me to get sick from food so not sure what went wrong last night. I guess the best piece of advice I can give is to stay away from the chicken. We however will not be returning.  Update: After a little over 2 weeks, the manager/owner messaged me apologizing for the issues and tried to make things right. This means a lot so I've taken the score from a 1 star to a 3 star. Hopefully this was a one off situation where we got sick.",

Drink refills, they didn't exist. Mexican food is salty and honestly, I need like three refills to get through a meal...Also, their soft drinks come in cans!!?!?! (refill cop-out).

Your system then said I did not have an account. I created one using another email account. Still no sign of delivery. I finally decided to call. This was a mistake. Daneilla answered the phone. I asked if you delivered she had to ask others if you did or not. The answer is no and said you tried it but it didn't work out. I understand that but why is there still a tweet about it?  That is what I asked her and yes very frustrated at this point. She said she would let her manager know in a very \"dismissive\" tone. This made me more frustrated and angry. I just said take the tweet down or let people know you don't deliver, in a gruff tone. She then had a sarcastic tone to her voice and it was rather disrespectful. She could have asked if I wanted to come and pick something up or maybe what would make me happy but she would rather anger a now \"non-costumer\" more than he already is. As I stated I love your food it's your attitude I can do without.",

They've recently changed the name and changed owners, but the food is the same high-quality, authentic Mexican food. The waitresses sometimes struggle with speaking English, which can be a little problematic when you are trying to convey that you don't want meat in your dish - but if you're a carnivore and you can just point to the menu item, then go for it.   While you're there, try the Mexican Coke. It's got real sugar in it instead of the high-fructose corn syrup...and it tastes amazing.",

    "text": "Eat here!    One week before I leave charlotte for most of the year and I FINALLY got around to eating at Three Amigos...and I was so happy!  I'll be in Arizona for the next two months, and I wonder if I'll be able to find more authentic mexican fare than this.  Perhaps more authentic, but more delicious, I don't know.    The table chips and salsa was just how I like it, the salsa kind of watery and the chips hot and salty.  (I don't like chunks of salsa, I just like to coat the chip with salsa flavor as opposed to actually eating the peppers or onions, which don't agree with me.)  I didn't try the margaritas (I was driving) but I kind of wish I had because I love them.   I ordered the Enchiladas Entomatadas, which is \"3 tortillas hand made with cheese and Mexican sausage, lettuce, tomato and sour cream served with rice and beans\" (according to the menu).  It also came with some cut up avocado.  The enchiladas seem to have been covered in red sauce, and the enchiladas are only filled with the sausage, and sprinkled with a bit of cotija on top, and finished with a drizzle of sour cream.  It was all buried under lettuce and tomatoes so I'm not entirely sure WHAT it was but I am sure that it was G-D delicious and I gobbled it all up.  The rice wasn't like any mexican rice I've had, being full of peas and carrots and corn like Chinese fried rice, but it was really good.  I wasn't a huge fan of the beans (I still ate them all, though, because I am a fan of beans and cheese in general.)    Service was good, the room is pretty small.  The 'La Belle Epoque' painting in the women's bathroom was amusingly out of place, but kind of endearing.    EAT HERE!",

The food is always good and normally the staff is nice. I'd recommend this place to anyone who's a fan of Mexican food. Sometimes the place can seem a little cramped when there are a lot of people dining in, but still a nice restaurant.",

    "text": "From No Culinary Backwater. A much anticipated but, a highly disappointing meal . I grew up eating a lot of Mexican food. Most was very good and some very very bad while living in California. Visiting Mexico City I was introduced to more authentic flavors. My friend's mother was a great home cook. She made fresh hand made tortillas. There was very few things which where much better than that. My first job as a line cook was in a Mexican restaurant. I was a souse chef in a hot Tex-Mex place in San Fransisco. Making friends with the remarkable Chef Guillermo Peters of Canal Street Bistro and his modern take on Mesoamerican cuisine . So I have a pretty good grasp on what makes a good meal from Mexican cuisine. Moving to Charlotte I was missing taste from home. My wife and I kept on hearing about Three Amigos <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.threeamigoscharlotte.com%2F&s=21656957471e86267a719c7655bc96413cf612467f2befc7b7ecfa116c82ae82\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">threeamigoscharlotte.com</a> . Canned microwaved , over seasoned or bland. Spanish rice made with frozen vegetables and condensed chicken MSG laden stock does not entice me to comeback. If your only exposure \"Mexican cuisine\" had been Taco Bell I guess you would call this a great place. For my time and money If i want good Mexican cuisine , I will have to make it myself.",

    "text": "I visited Three Amigos on a recommendation for the Mole Enchiladas. I actually hate Mole, but our out-of-tower guests are huge fans so I decided to suck it up.  We ordered some margaritas which were a mixed bag. Delicious, fresh taste, but completely and totally lacking in alcohol. I was running on bone-dry stomach and even after a large there wasn't even the beginning hint of a buzz. Perhaps they were trying to upsell their half-off tequila shot special for the night?  We ordered our food and let's get the best part of the night out of the way: The mole was freaking amazing. A little spicy, not to sweet, with flavors that were really missing from my previous experiences. I also got a dish with a little thin slab of steak that tasted delicious. It wasn't tender or anything, but when you have a slice that's a couple mm thick you want it to be crusty and salty rather than super soft.  Now to the bad. I got more traditional enchiladas and I'll be honest: I was expecting a heck of a lot more. There were 4 very skinny enchiladas (explaining how the all-you-can-eat special came around), covered with an INSANE amount of lettuce and tasteless cheese, with a little dashing of super bitter onions. Beneath at least 2 inches of filler, the enchiladas were already fighting a losing battle and had virtually nothing to offer anyway. The queso being bland wasn't an issue really, I know it's mostly there for decoration, but the veggies were what sealed the deal. In addition, the chips that we got were pretty gross. They had some seasoning on them but they were cold and stale. The salsa tasted pretty good, but the cilantro was crushed instead of sliced in big soggy leaves.  I'll also say that the tacos al pastor my neighbor had were determined to be mediocre as well.  It looks like Three Amigos is a neighborhood staple for Plaza Midwood. The problem is that it seems like the hipsters in the neighborhood have given them a pass. \"Authenticity\" does not have to be a synonym for bland, but it seems like they've carried their name based on just their mole. There needs to be more than a sauce behind a restaurant, and I'm not sure I'll be back.  Final (not inconsequential) point was that service was very friendly and efficient, which saved this rating from 2 stars. Add a little salt and some peppers to your other dishes (though who knows if you can due to regulars) and this place could actually be pretty great.",

Always drink specials and food specials most nights!  All-you-can-eat Enchiladas on Thursdays.  Very well priced.  $13.50 for mixed grill fajitas- nice sized shrimp, chicken and steak!!!  Very generous portions... My roommate and I shared one meal after discovering the big quantities on our first visit!  We stopped in the first time on a Saturday night.... FREE Bingo starting at 9:30pm!!!  We won gift cards and free \"Three Amigos\" shot glasses!  Yum chips and salsa, $2 tacos EVERYDAY!!!  Great, affordable Mexican food!",

    "text": "The Good: Seasoned Chip's and delicious Guacamole! Insane portions, many selections to choose from, clean & tidy restaurant. Food presentation was very nice. Very liberal with the avocado as a garnish ( a huge plus in my opinion)  The ok:  Not a huge deal since it's only a dollar but still, the server was friendly but didn't disclose up-charges (i.e $1 extra for more tortillas). My boyfriend is pretty easy-to-please so he liked his steak fajitas but I thought the steak was sinewy though the flavor was really nice. My enchilada roja was way too spicy (for me) so I probably would order something different next time.   The bad: We called ahead to use our yelp deal, which was a good thing because the fine print says it's not valid on Fridays and Saturdays.....but according to the person on the phone, for some reason it's not valid on Sundays either. It's fine if you're  not going to accept these deals on certain days, but at least have that information clearly printed at the time of purchase. Also,  I despise canned soft drinks at a dine-in restaurant mainly because I am the type of person that needs a sip with every bite. I found myself finished with my Dr. Pepper well before my entree even arrived and I didn't want to pay $2 or so for another canned soda.",

    "text": "I've decided that every return trip to Charlotte should be marked by a visit to Three Amigos. This place is a legit little Mexican cantina on Central with solid food and quite good drinks.  I tend to avoid giant Margaritas (bad tequila experiences in my youth) but they're serving up some good ones here that are definitely a must-have.   As for the food i'm definitely a fan of the Enchiladas; particularly the Enchiladas Rojas which have just the right amount of spice without being completely overwhelmed by tortilla and beans like at many Mexican spots.   The service has been hit and miss. The staff are very nice but they tend to disappear for a bit after you've gotten your food (I'm still waiting on my water).  All in all this is a great little place and all the positive reviews are not far off.",

I grew up near Chicago, which has a big Mexican population dating back to the 1930s, and I lived for four years as an adult in Southern California, so you can say I'm a big fan of Mexican.  My litmus test for any Mexican joint is the beans, and this place passed with flying colors.    All the food I've had here was good.  If I were 20 years younger and lived closer to this place, I'd eat here three times per week.",

This restaurant looks like it never gets cleaned. It took about five minutes for a server to greet us in spite of the fact that there were six servers and we were one of six active tables. At one point our server was standing in the kitchen eating while we waited for our food. The closest thing we received to service was a different server noticing me coughing and offering me a water. At the time he was standing next to our server who was staring off into space. Someone needs to start paying attention to any details at this place.",

    "text": "Have to do a quick update for my favorite Mexican spot in the city. Dalton, and the crew at Three Amigos offered to host my company holiday party this past Saturday night. All I have to say is Three Amigos continues to impress. Out of 13 people, my wife and I were the only ones who had ever been here so I was very excited to show my co-workers some great, authentic food.  We arranged to be served family style for such a big group and everything was perfect. Started with pitchers of margaritas, a few beers, chips, salsa, queso fondito (chorizo & onion) and their incredible guac.  I had asked specifically if they would make us some empanadas off of the late night Dominican menu and boy am I glad I did. They came out next, stuffed with either chicken or beef, they were incredible.  Then came huge platters of rice and beans, followed by enchiladas served with either rojo, verde, or mole sauce. All 3 were incredible. Also served was Bistec ala Mexicana, which is basically a Mexican beef dish, served in a sauce of tomato, onions, chili, and a few other veggies. That stuff was amazing!! They finished up with desserts from a local Mexican bakery, Las Delicias, (which will be reviewed as well).  We had a full Tres Leches cake, flan, and guava empanadas.  The staff was amazing, and very accommodating, especially considering we got a little loud towards the end of the night. (Patron shots will do that to ya)  Big thanks to everyone at Three Amigos, you have forever won me and many of my co-workers over for best Mexican in the city.",

But we ended up liking it a lot actually despite the location.  The place was clean, service was good, we parked out front but we got the last spot...not sure if there are other parking options.  I don't remember exactly what we got but for those of you who are Jim Gaffigan fans you can be sure it was some sort of meat, cheese, and tortilla mix.  Sorry, couldn't resist.  We got the carne asada and the enchiladas al hormo.  Both pretty good.  Also they served drinks (sprite) straight from the can...not bragging or complaining...just stating a fact.  I know our rating seems a little low for how much we liked it but the problem is that the difference between bad Mexican food and good Mexican food just isn't that much.  Especially when you are talking about Americanized Mexican food.  We give it 3.5 amigos out of 5",

First off, this was not my first time visiting this establishment. I have been here a handful of times. The first time being back in 2012. I always liked the vibe and food was pretty good and plentiful.  Most recently I came here a couple of days ago and haven't been able to shake off this experience. We sat down, got our chips and as I am talking to my partner I notice \"it.\" It was crawling on the back of my partner's seat. It was a german cockroach and it was in our booth. I looked around and noticed the food on the floors, the ceiling that has stains, the sticky wall next to us, the sanitation rating and couldn't help but think that there must be tons more of these all around. I was afraid to look under the table. I told my partner about the visitor. We decided to get up and leave. I am sad to have to write a review like this. The place needs a deep cleaning, a new paint job and an exterminator visit. There are so many new and exciting places that have opened up in Charlotte since I moved here in 2012....I will not be back until I know things have changed.",

My boyfriend and I devoured two baskets immediately upon arrival (they're complementary as well - always a plus!) I got the vegetable fajitas, and the portions are HUGE. This place really gives you your money's worth. Depending on how much you eat, easily two meals in one. Maybe even three. I also started with an empanada and it truly was decadently rich, oozing cheese and a thick crust. It was pretty big in size, like everything else (in a good way). We finished by splitting the churros and ice cream. Lots of ice cream and four caramel filled churros. So much food with ample leftovers for two people and it was maybe $30 - a three course meal with plenty to spare for $15/person. The pricing is truly superb for such quality Mexican.  The environment was very family friendly, though not a large space. You won't feel tight or overcrowded at your table, but I'm sure this place fills up during peak lunch and dinner hours.The staff was friendly and present, without being overbearing - all you could ask for.  Easy to order vegetarian, and certainly can fanangle a vegan order.  Ultimately, would enthusiastically recommend!",

    "text": "Decided to give Three Amigos a try after a certain amount of recommendations and reviews about the place. I visited on a Tuesday night with my friend and surprised at how small the place is! It's a True hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant.  We ordered the (small) house margarita and I found it to be a bit bland. I didn't get much flavor or 'oomph' from the drink. I've definitely had better margaritas.  We were given the standard complimentary salsa and chips and I ordered a small portion of the guacamole. The salsa? VERY good and the chips were slightly seasoned which provided a nice flavor. The guac was good, it tasted very fresh but nothing else that was of note to remark about.  I ordered the enchiladas de horno (chicken enchiladas with cheese, onions, cilantro and avocado) which came with re-fried beans and rice. I loved the portion size of the enchiladas. They weren't your standard oversized portion found at other Mexican spots. My biggest problem with the meal was that parts of the rice was overcooked. Like, crunchy bits of rice which is a big downgrade for me.  I've had better Mexican food but I'd definitely give Three Amigos another try!",

This place is no Ned Nederlander! It's definitely more of a Lucky Day (If you have no idea about the movie Three Amigos...you're completely lost...but that's okay...well...for me anyhow)!  Situated in the neighborhood of...not sure I really want to park my car here, Three Amigos brings a robust assortment of great tasting Mexican dishes. I've eaten many of their dishes and enjoyed all of them. If you're looking for Mexico...tough...if you're looking for great Mexican flavors that tend to aim for gringos...you're in luck.  The salsa and margaritas are so-so...but real salsa and real margaritas would likely make their patrons mad when they saw the price tag.  The inside is what you'd expect of a Mexican restaurant...and like many Mexican restaurants we've been to, they don't have a ton of space to maneuver. So if you hate rubbing elbows with people...not your place.  What to get: The Tacos al Pastor are spot on  What to avoid: Nothing really, just avoid the lofty expectations of your visits to Mexico",

I will give them this....they do have a tasty salsa and chips. Their guac is up to par as well, nice and chunky and flavorful. All the menu items I found to be a decent versions but thats it, just decent. The chimichanga however is something I will go to Three Amigos in particular for. Specifically because its basically a fried burrito versus how the more authentic places do chimichangas, fried tortilla filled with meat, served with a side of rice and beans. I like it all in there, preferably with steak. You can get them served with rice and beans or a la cart, which is plenty of food for one person to eat and have leftovers. They are also on the lunch menu for around 6 bucks. But this is really the only reason I will come here anymore and even the quality/taste of the steak is hit or miss. Its also the only mexican place (not doing a taco tuesday) that has had a wait for a table.  For my money, time, and stomach there are better options in the neighborhood for sure. At least it is better than La Unica....",

It is basically french fries covered with ketchup and mayonnaise, followed by cheese and ground beef. I can't even explain how amazingly good this meal was.

    "text": "I came here because a few friends of mine swore up and down that this place had great Mexican, and maybe I ordered wrong, or they hyped it up too much, but this place was nothing more than ok.  We waited 40 minutes to sit (party of 2) on a Friday evening at 8PM so we were assuming if the wait was this long the food was going to be to die for. Now I know its really just because this place is so tiny. There are maybe 15-20 tables in the entire restaurant. The good news is there are about 6 seats at the bar where you can order a marg while you wait. The margs are huge, and pretty tastes, but also pretty weak. I guess that's what you get for $5 tho.    Things started to look up after we were finally seated and right away we got complementary chips and salsa which we downed immediately. The chips came out warm and well seasoned and the salsa was tasty.   YELP TIP: You get a free empanada with your check in and this was my favorite part of the meal! It was delicious, stuffed with cheese and beef and was big enough for us to share as an app.   My boyfriend got the shrimp tostadas and he was happy with his meal. I got a shrimp and a steak taco and I was just not impressed. There was an odd taste to the season in, almost nutmeg-y.   I think what really left a bad taste in my mouth tho (pun intended ;)) was the woman's bathroom. It was absolutely disgusting when I walked in, paper towels all over the floor, visible dirt, hair, and water everywhere. I couldn't even squat over the dirty toilet without slipping - I nearly fell in!   Overall, I'm giving three stars because the staff was very nice and the food was very cheap. Willing to come back and try something on the menu, but I won't be rushing back anytime soon.",

They charge extra for things they didn't when they first opened and they no longer serve a side of guacamole, which they used to do; now you must buy the whole order or as the old saying goes \"the whole enchilada\".

Walked in and sat at the bar and there were 2 other people sitting at the bar about to leave and maybe 2 tables in the restaurant.  2 employees passed me numerous times and never acknowledged me.  Employees stood and talked and still no acknowledgement.  I sat there for 7 long minutes before I decided to go somewhere else.  Wish I could say how it was but I got no service so I dunno how it is.  Won't try it again which sucks because I live very close.",

The queso fundido with chorizo and carmelized onions is a don't-miss. Used to always order a la carte (try the beef tongue tacos!!) until I discovered the Shrimp Quesadilla. It's AMAZING!! Shrimp is high in quality and quantity and buttery delicious. Super cheesy also!!",

    "text": "I lived down Central from Three Amigos for about 2 years. Let's just say that I could never have frequented this place enough. It's a perfect shining mexican flagship for the Plaza area. Nestled in a dive-y little strip (thus, parking can be a bit of a problem on busy nights) and quaint/understated. Three Amigos is definitely a go-to for authentic Mexican in Charlotte.   The pros outweigh the cons tenfold for this place. The only negatives to report, which I'm pretty sure everyone has experienced, is the service. You might wait for a half hour for your app/entree or MUCH longer with no whisper of timeframe, and its iffy you'll be able to communicate a need for a swift dining experience. This can be a bit annoying for some diners. I'd recommend hitting up Three Amigos when you've got some time to kill. This place gets SLAMMED, too. Kick back and take advantage of the humongous margaritas.   The food is to die for. I've never had better queso fundido. Definitely worth the $4 to pair with the fresh salsa and chips. We heartily enjoyed every last drop and even used what was left on our entrees.   Bistec a la Mexicano was incredible. So many sauteed veggies and perfectly seasoned steak with rice and all of the standard Mexican accouterment. So much on my plate it was hard to consume all of the goodness in one sitting. My compliments to the chef on this dish. Incredible flavors.   Un Chile Relleno will make you melt. The only thing I could say is that I wish it were \"Dos\" Chile Rellenos. Filled with amazing cheese and avocado.   Prices are rather fair for the level of flavor and execution. Love this spot in Plaza. Whenever I crave Mexican, Three Amigos is what I think of first. Ole!",

Flavors haven't budged, but the scope of the menu is larger (platos typicos, fajitas, larger selection of tortas, etc). Prices are the same for brekkie, a little higher on big plates.

When you sit down, you get these tortilla chips (like at every Mexican restaurant) but these are different! They have some kind of magical spices on them! I almost ate the whole basket, without salsa!!!! I ordered the camarones a la diabla. This is a dish I enjoy at most Mexican restaurants. Three Amigos does it the best.

SCORE.  She recommended the enchiladas verde, which was FANTASTIC.  I could slurp their verde sauce with a spoon.  Plantains once again instead of rice.  Seriously, they should just forgo the rice and serve fried plantains with every dish.  It could be their signature.",

    "text": "A week ago, the boy and I dropped in for a late lunch after a trip to Discovery Place. The restaurant was packed, so we waited about 10 minutes for our table.  With a Groupon in tow, we started with the guacamole. It was really good, but I like mine a bit spicier. He ordered a taco al pastor and a pollo gordita and I had the enchiladas verdes. He loved the taco and I had a bite of the gordita, deciding to order one for sure the next time.  I was happily surprised that my enchiladas were topped with queso fresco, crema, sliced avocado, and shredded lettuce, just as they would have been served in Mexico. The rice and beans were great, especially the beans (super creamy, just like my mom's!)   For dessert, we shared the tres leches. I've been cutting back on sweets, so it tasted very sweet to me at first. But, after bite number three, I was in tres leches heaven.   Service was a bit slow, but we weren't in a hurry, so we didn't really mind. I'm very happy to add Three Amigos to my short list of crave-able authentic Mexican restaurants the QC area (La Unica in Indian Trial and Don Pedro's in Pineville are the other two if you're wondering).",

Three Amigo's is good and cheap.  Me...yeah, but I always overeat at Mexican restaurants  Wife...So don't eat everything on your plate  Me...I can't help myself, I've tried. Those damn combos kill me.  Wife...laughs...you have a problem  Me...at least I admit it   1 hour 28 minutes later, I'm full after chips & quac (good guac!) and my chimichanga \"combo\". So good...so much food...and only $8. Add in a large margarita and bottle of beer and I am full. Yep...did it again. I left some rice and beans for whoever took my plate though.   Three Amigo's is a great spot in Plaza that has a few small tables and a wall of booths. Don't be afraid of the so-so strip mall exterior, this place has great cheap food. It's also open until 4am on Friday & Saturday's. Good lord, if I'm there that late I know I won't have any room left from the night's PBR's, but as I know, I'll still stuff my face with good Mexican food. Damn you Three Amigo's! :)",

    "text": "Eating at Three Amigos has the feeling of going over to your uncle's place for dinner...you know, if your uncle happens to be a fabulous Mexican cook.  I came in and was greeted by a supremely huggable woman who gave me a basket of freshly made chips and salsa that smacked of cilantro. When I said I didn't want a drink, she asked again, this time in spanish.  I decided on the Enchiladas Poblanas. They came with a rich mole that hinted strongly but did not scream of chocolate, and were topped with just the right amount of sour cream and cheese. The shredded chicken inside was super flavorful and not at all overcooked. The rice was mild but not dry and the beans were tasty. The waitress came back to check if I really didn't want water twice during the meal.  The food itself was amazing but it was made all the better by the laughing, dancing and general warm atmosphere that accompanied them. The whole shebang came to about $10 with tip.  Oh and next time I go back, I need to try one of those substantial margaritas made from the assorted bottles of liquor stashed on the random piece of furniture behind the counter. I mean, it IS within walking distance of my house.",

Chips and salsa: delicious Menu: Not too extensive. I was especially wary because there's a section called \"Mexican Fast Food\" or something that highlights quesadillas and tacos...the enchiladas, though, are the restaurant's self-proclaimed house specialty. I went with Enchiladas al Hormo with vegetables instead of chicken or beef (**Vegetarian side note: All the enchiladas have the option of coming with veggies instead of meat. Delicious**) -- best enchiladas I've ever had.  Will definitely go again. OH and drink specials every night. We enjoyed $2.50 Coronas.",

    "text": "Three Amigos successfully combines the best of Mexican dishes for American customers and \"down home cooking\" for the Mexican patrons in one cozy setting.  The place is quite unpretentious-the focus is on the  food and quality service.  I've been several times and enjoyed the carne asada tacos immensely.  They serve them on flour tortillas with onion and cilantro. The chimichanga is quite decadent: a fried burrito with melted cheese.  Unlike alot of Mexican restaurants, the menu is not complicated with lunch combinations of more of the same.  You can skim the menu in 2 minutes flat and get an idea of what's good.  And yummy dinner entrees for less than $10 are worth yelping about.  Helpful hint-They bring bland gringo salsa with chips.  Upon request, you can try three more spicier salsas.  The spicy avocado rocks, albeit in small doses!  Its all made IN HOUSE!  I think that when I establish rapport with the staff after several visits, they would be willing to make some avocado sauce with a little less kick.    The word \"flavor\" sticks out in my mind when I think about Three Amigos.  Don't believe me, try it yourself.",

    "text": "I'm a FOODIE, I admit it and that is why I HAVE to start working out again. I told my mom I need to get my  mouth wired.  ANYWAY, enough about me and my personal tantrums! On to business...THREE AMIGOS!  After reading the reviews the night before, I was ready to run out of the door in the pouring rain to try this AWESOME Mexican food. I was tired of the chain restaurants and wanted something authentic, not to mention the rave about the margaritas.  Alas, my boyfriend and I went to Three Amigos for lunch yesterday. Talking about shabby chic - just the way I like it. From experience the most shabbiest places has the best food. If you're looking for ambiance, this is not the place for you - go to Cantina for that (their food isn't all that great either). Anyway, so my boyfriend and I ordered the enchiladas. I had the Enchilada Verde...hands down I loved the sauce. When they placed that mound in front of me, I said..surely I can not eat all of this BUT as soon as I took my first bite, I smiled!  My boyfriend ordered the enchilada with the red sauce, I want to say it was called Enchalada Roja - he enjoyed it as well!  We will definitley be back and will try the other dishes my fellow Yelpers have raved about.   BTW, the chips and salsa was okay - I've had better at On the Border (I know...CHAIN!) I'm so not a fan of Chain restaurants  Until next time, Yelp on fellow Foodies!",

    "text": "\"Jefe, would you say that I have a `plethora' of pinatas?\" \"Oh, si . . . . \"    The Three Amigos.  The name conjures up images of Steve Martin,  Chevy Chase, and Martin Short--three clueless unemployed actors in Mexico who have no idea what they've gotten themselves into.  Likewise, I didn't know what to expect once this place had changed hands, but it turns out I like it a lot.     I'll echo everything that Julia S. has said and add my own 2 cents.   I fully believe that the food at Three Amigos is actually better than it was at Casa de las Enchiladas.  My friend ordered 3 different kinds of tacos a la carte (beef, pork, and chicken) with a side order of pico de gallo to lovingly tuck them in before devouring them and sending them to Hell.  She loved them.  The meats were savory and seasoned well, and they came wrapped in aromatic corn flour tortillas.  The pico was spicy, fresh, and the cilantro and lime juice were popping--better than before.    I enjoyed a very nice order of pollo en mole with rice and beans and washed it down with a bottle of coca-cola made in Mexico.  Yep--sweetened with good ol' sugar and not high fructose corn syrup.  (google Dr. Mercola if you want to learn what HFCS can do to you.)  Thanks to Chad E for the mole recommendation.           I didn't try the bar, but I'm thinking the next time I'm in there I'd like to wash the food down with a Corona.      We have no complaints except for the dueling juke box and stereo system.  That was a little disconcerting.    I hope you'll visit this place (AND see the movie).  Three Amigos has two more amigos as of today.    I'll leave you with this quote: \"Hey!  He's using real bullets!\"",
