My favorite meal is the chicken fajitas, and the serving is more than enough to share with another person.  Service has always been fast and attentive.  Top shelf margaritas are generous with the liquor. ;)   My only complaint is that they recently changed their chips and I really dislike them!  They are thick and seem stale.  But, I'll still go and skip the chips, and have the complimentary sopapillas for dessert.",

As a shrimp lover, a favorite dish is the Carnitas Camarones which is prawns sliced and fried with onions, green peppers and mushrooms served with rice and beans.  They usually have a margarita special (mango = yummy) along with a beer special.  The restaurant is always crowded for dinner on the weekends.  Although the restaurant is pretty large, I suggest you arrive before the dinner time hour so that you don't have to wait.",

After driving home and getting settled (nearly 25 minutes later) the container which was not secured by the manager who packed my order, spilled into my lap. I was rushed to the hospital where it was determined that I had received 2nd degree burns from their soup, through denim jeans, nearly HALF AN HOUR LATER! I have been given the run around from the restaurant, their management, and their insurance group The Main Street America Group who refuse to cover my just medical expenses or answer my questions. Those of you that know my family and I know that we are honest, hard-working people who don't ask for more than we are justly due. I am asking you join my family and I in spreading this warning by reposting this and boycotting this restaurant. If you do choose to dine with them, I don't recommend the soup.",

The server we had apparently had  someplace he needed to be or would rather be. He was very impatient when we were trying to decide what to eat. Once we decided the meals were not as good as in the past. I ate less than half of mine and the server never asked if everything was ok just came by and said are you done and took my plate. Oh well, not like I would be going back here soon but now I will certainly not recommend it.",

Although, it was a Monday (June 1, specifically), the dining rooms and even the bar was crowded. That being said the service was prompt & pleasant. Having 3 hungry young men at the table kept the chips & salsa person busy. I knew better than to partake, because the entrees are huge. I did have a very large Margarita, and my honey and eldest son had 2 of the largest Does Equis that I've ever seen. Each time I visit I try to order something different, rather than my fave from my first Mexican restaurant in Charlotte when I arrived some 30 years ago-El Cancun. They too had an amazing air of authenticity & super food. My honey had a dish with the mole sauce (which is a delightful mix of dark chocolate & spices, my eldest ordered the Steak Azteca- a nice piece of meat with rice & refried beans. He said the steak was cooked perfectly, medium rare. The younger boys ordered the super nacho plate. I fell back on my old El Cancun fave- the large chicken burrito. I was not disappointed. It was filled with good quality chicken breast & all was seasoned to perfection. Portions were so large we all brought food home. Finally, my honey was amused to have the sombrero put on his head and have his birthday celebration. More to go boxes needed, as the boys brought home their dessert. I wasn't left out, as even though, I didn't order dessert, they brought over a couple of Cinnamon chips topped with whipped cream and a cherry! We will continue to go to Azteca, especially as summer comes, just to drink margaritas on the patio. Well done Azteca!!",

I liked the wood furniture and decor.  I had a feeling I'd been there before, but it's fairly new, and it was my first visit...  Everyone who tried the complimentary homemade chips and salsa enjoyed it.  I ordered the Two Taco combo, where I chose a soft taco filled w/ beef for myself, and gave a hard corn taco (also w/ beef) to my nephew.  Enjoyed everything else on my plate!  The \"dirty rice\" wasn't greasy, and I liked the texture and flavor of the refried beans.  Mom and sis shared a fajita combo platter, with chicken and shrimp, which they both enjoyed.  I'd sampled a juice (sorry, but forgot the name) drink that wasn't on the menu, but didn't like it- tasted like cough syrup to me, so I went ahead and ordered sweet iced tea.  Wouldn't mind going back to try their other lunch combos, or to have dinner there on our next visit to the Queen City!",

    "text": "Staying in Charlotte for a week, asked the Hotel desk person where was a good Mexican restaurant. She raved about Azteca so thought I should give it a try. I walked in and was immediately  greeted and asked where I wanted to sit. They brought over chips and salsa [?] to be honest it really wasn't salsa it was very very watery with some raw onions.. almost no spice at all. I had to add salt to get any flavor at all.   I ordered the Pork Carnitas Plate. The plate its self was HUGE, however the pork carnitas took up only 1/8 or less of the plate. There were two sides of what i'm guessing was like a \"fresh\" vegetable salsa maybe. I tasted it but it was really odd/dry/no taste. Then the rice & refried beans. The person who made the beans must have made the salsa for the chips as well. They were very very thin...to the point they would fall though the tines in my fork. No cheese on them and again no seasoning/spice.   Now i'm honestly not trying to be negative towards the restaurant everyone else seemed to really enjoy them... so i'm guessing it has to be that with living in California we have real Mexican food practically on every corner especially with the taco trucks and they are not afraid of spice at all. It was just very different and didn't appeal to me at all...if i came back I would not give them another try...Sorry.",

Their quesadilla is a form of processed cheese slices btw if you were thinking about ordering that from here. By this time we have had 4 different waiters/waitresses as well. When we asked to speak to a manager the response was, \"The manager isn't here.\" We said, \"Who is the next in charge?\" They responded with \"nobody.\" Also as a side note, we never received napkins or silverware at any point in time during the meal. Who in the world would need silverware to eat lunch??? DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE FOR ANY TYPE OF SERVICE. Awful, awful, awful.",

    "text": "I was thinking \"Yeah I'll give them a 4-star review!\" but then I realized I have no experiences which led me to think they deserved less than five!  First of all I can't believe it took me so long to finally check this place out. Considering I live just around the corner and have basically commuted past it for over 4 years. When you come in you are typically greeted in Spanish with an \"Hola\" before being brought to a table. As with most Mexican restaurants they have what I would call a chip busboy. Basically a guy that is dedicated to running chips around to people that have just been seated. When you get your chips and salsa, don't forget to ask for pico as well. There is no additional charge and it is a bit spicier than the salsa. (I just dump the two together in one bowl and dig in.)  Probably the most notable thing here is the size of the plates. You're thinking \"Sure, big plates with lots of garnish. Big whoop.\" And you're right, it's one thing to have a big plate and another to fill said plate. Azteca fills 'em so you can fill your guts. Edge to edge, 360 degrees. Ever heard the saying that empty space helps compliment the items in an area? No it doesn't, fill that spot with rice, refries, salad and cheese-enchilada sauce melted over the edges. That's right Bojangles, you can keep your tiny biscuit cheese-skirt. Azteca's is bigger, better and blankets an enchilada stuffed with delicious. (Yes, delicious is a noun now.) As far as enchiladas go, I can highly recommend the menu item Enchiladas Suizas. You will be happily plump on less than $10.  Round-out your filling meal with a few of those easy-to-drink Mexican beers. Last but not least you will receive a pie-like slice of crispy sopapilla topped with a sweet cinnamon glaze and whipped cream. You might even think you could eat a whole Azteca-sized plate of these.

I decided to go to Azteca since I had never been before . Upon reviewing the menu , I noticed it looked eerily familiar to Don Pedro's, after chatting with the waiter it was confirmed that they are more or less the same restaurant and share the same menu , interesting !  Anyways  back to the dinner , the waiter took our order without  any issues and came by to see how we were doing prior to our food  coming out and seemed  like a pretty nice guy . Unfortunately that was the last we heard of him ,He just disappeared after that .  The food came out and everything was ok .   A lady named  Ana ( who seemed really nice ) , was able to get our check and let us pay . I was never told of what happened to our waiter .   Within hours of eating the food ( Fiesta Chimichanga and chips and salsa) an explosive sickness came over me like no other and left me running to the  bathroom from 4am to nearly 10am . Yikes !!!   I definitely didn't order a side of food poisoning or whatever that was , with my chimichanga . Nonetheless I'm glad it didn't last too long and after about a day I'm feeling pretty darn good again :) . Probably won't be going to either Don Pedro's or Azteca for quite some time.",

    "text": "I came here last night to meet up with a few friends. I'd never been here and wasn't too excited about it because I'd just had Mexican food last week, but decided to go simply for the fellowship. I walked in and was greeted immediately. I was the first person to get there so I got us a table. The waiter came right over and asked if I wanted anything to drink. I ordered the blue margarita which was actually really yummy. The chips and salsa were AMAZING!!! I usually ended up adding seasoning to salsa at Mexican restaurants because they're typically bland, but this salsa was perfect! I ordered a shrimp dish with rice, mushrooms, and onions and was surprised to see how big the dish was! Our food came out in a timely manner and looked amazing. I made the HUGE mistake of going to the restroom before digging in. As I walk in, I pass an employee standing at the sink texting on her phone. Out of the 3 stalls, two of them were dirty. A lady came in after me and went into the stall that I'm assuming was at least decent. I go into the lesser of two evils and, just to my luck, the door is broken and it won't close properly. UGH!! I was forced to go into the stall that needed attention and just flushed the toilet before using it but soon realized that I should've just waited for the lady to finish in the decent stall. I had no tissue!! I guess the employee was too busy making sure the text was sent to whomever to check the cleanliness of the bathroom. I go up to wash my hands and see used paper towels in one of the two sinks. I guess she couldn't be bothered enough to even throw the paper towels in the trash. Those texts must've been super important. I had to force myself not to think about what I saw in the bathroom as I went back to eat my food. I had to push the image out of my mind and try to shake it off. Yuck!! My food was DELISH and I was more than pleased. The staff needs to pay just as much attention to ensuring that restrooms are clean as they do the food because this makes for a complete experience for the guest. I would recommend this place but will warn you, use the restroom at home before coming in here.",

They told me it would be ready in a, reasonable, 15 minutes. 15 minutes later I arrived to pick up my food. I told them what I was waiting for, then stood and waited another 45 minutes (one hour total time) for my food to come out. After waiting one hour I was told that my two burritos would be $38. I told them that must be a mistake, as all I ordered was two chicken burritos. There was no way they could be $19 a piece. I did add cheese to them, which I agreed to the $1.25 up charge for. They insisted that the price was right, and my two chicken burritos would be $38. (Side note: I recently went to chilis and shared two margaritas, an appetizer, two dinner entrees, and a desert, for $35)  One hour of wait time, and $38 later, I left with two mediocre chicken burritos that I could have gotten for significantly cheaper at most any other Mexican restaurant in the area. I will not be back.",

My husband and I both ordered a bowl each. He went ahead and ordered the pork Carnitas, but I knew the bowl was going to be big based on the price, so I held off ordering anything else. First, our waitress brought a small bowl 1/2 filled with chopped white onion the other 1/2 filled with chopped Cilantro and on top was a slice of a lime!!!! When the bowls of soup arrived our eyes nearly bugged out of our heads!  It was AMAZING! So amazing that we told our waitress to tell the manager and she got him for us!  Alex is a very concerned, very gracious manager. He was so happy that we were so happy!  You MUST try a Frozen Mango Margarita!  Again, the best we've ever had!!!! By the way, the Pork Carnitas were very good also, it was just that my husbands eyes were bigger than his stomach and I was so very happy with my Albondigas Soup!  If you like really good Mexican Food, go see Alex and tell him Joe and Monica sent you  :)",

There were some nice touches that bring it up a notch or two over similar restaurants - generous use of cilantro, pickled onions and cactus salad with the carnitas - but they were negated by the over cooked carnitas meat, packaged corn tortillas and tasteless Huevos Rancheros.   The restaurant itself is huge and colorfully appointed; service is very good. The bill for lunch was very inexpensive. Despite everything this is actually one of the better choices around Northlake; but that says more about the dearth of good dining options in that area.",

For the main course, i shared the enchilada , tostado combination with my mother. it was good.. I took away one star because being a vegetarian, all dishes come with the same same black bean filling. so apart from the presentation all the dishes taste pretty much the same.

My coworker got sick the next day after eating there and the salsa was so watery. I decided to give this restaurant a second try and ordered the whole fish. First and foremost they fried the fish in oil and didn't put any seasoning or butter. I asked the waitress why they didn't season the fish but only throw it in oil and she replied that's just how we cook it. I had to throw the entire meal away and once again the salsa looked and tasted like water that was dyed red.

They need new management and will go down if they continue to have poor service and the I don't care attitude.",

It had rice, beans,vegetables and huge hot pepper. Chips and salsa tasty but salsa could be alittle bit thicker. They gave you a free little tortilla chip with whip cream and strawberry drizzle on it. It was tasty. Friendly and good service. My husband had the Chicken Fajitas. He ordered them due to the reviews. He would have preferred larger strips of Chicken instead of small leftover pieces. I will be back with my mama to try again but probably not my husband.",

The service was on point - our server definitely stayed on top of providing us with excellent service. So my 2 star is in no reflection of that.   Chips and salsa were banging. The rest of our food was just mediocre. I can't even remember what we ordered now - that is how much it left an impression on me. My son ordered a burger and while it was pretty big - it tasted like they ran it over several times. It was just so tough and dry.  They give you complimentary dessert which is nice but it is just some fried tortillas with cinnamon and sugar.",

I'd recommend this spot to anyone looking for all around, great Mexican food and outstanding service!",

Nothing spectacular. My rice I don't think it was cooked all the way because there were some grains in there that were hard as if they were not cooked all the way. The ground beef in my chimichanga to me it did seem a little on the cheaper cut of beef.  Ur overall, I liked my food. The restaurant was nicely decorated and it seemed liked a good atmosphere. I would recommend this Mexican restaurant if you're in the area...I just have to try this place for dinner.",

    "text": "Ehhh I'm updating my review because I want to give them kudos to how well they handled the HUGE cinco de mayo crowd. My coworkers and I showed up around noon and the place was P - A - C - K - E - D. We were group of five and were able to be seated immediately.  Our waiter came to greet us and let us know there was a margarita special: order a margarita, get a free t-shirt. Unfortunately, the waiter failed to share that there was a price markup during the ordering process, but more on that later.  Two baskets of chips and salsa were brought out for the table and our food orders were placed. We plowed through both baskets of chips and salsa and another waiter kindly brought out two more baskets while we waited. Our food did seem to take a little longer than normal but it ended up being all right in the end. I went with the chicken carnitas lunch special and liked it, nothing great but good enough.   Once it was time to cash out, my co-workers who'd placed margarita orders were shocked to see that the amount was $11-$12 for their drinks rather than the normal $8 or $9 for margaritas. Just would've been nice if the price increase would've been explained.  I went solo a few weeks later because I had a vicious craving for huevos rancheros. I was disappointed once my food came out because there wasn't much egg (huevo) to be found. I ordered the rancheros with chorizo and it was basically a plate filled of chorizo. The beans and rice were not that great and it was just, overall, not a good meal. I was very disappointed.  Can't say that I'll be going back anytime soon.",

The menu is huge with selections /dishes. The downside from this place in comparison to other Mexican restaurants is this place is pricey on their menu. I can get the same quality of dishes for lesser price somewhere else.   With that being said, they have some of the best Queso in the area!!!. They serve you a huge bowl for $5.50. I am particular over salsa. I personally enjoyed theirs. It's full of onions, cilantro and peppers drowning in a garlicky tomato puree. My husband didn't quite like but he's no fan of onions as I am. The Chips are just ok.   The service was decent,  no complaints.    I may return someday when I forget that I don't like the flavor of their steak or the Tostado soup was not chicken broth tasty. For presentation. It looked awesome! The taste just didn't sit well with me. Maybe on a Queso quest, I'll be back!!!",

I was impressed on how clean this place was (its a big restaurant), service from our waiter was an A+, food was also good.  Only bad detail i can point out is the faucet in the bathroom area (men's),  if you are in formal attire just be carefull, that faucet will splatter the watter all over.    (It may be embarrassing on a date).  *Make sure you order the spicy salsa for your chips, otherwise you be dissapointed with the \"watery\" one.",

When we arrived at the restaurant the other 4 people from our party were already there for 20 minutes, none of which had received even their water. Once we arrived it was another 20 minutes before our waitress came to the table to get our drink order. From there on it was only downhill. Our waitress had an awful attitude. we had to repeatedly ask for things such as BAISC things like salsa, chips, water. These are things are expected from a customer at a restaurant one would think. To put us over the top in our final bill they had charged us for THREE 16oz salsa's ($14.95 total) which our table NEVER received. When we asked to speak to the \"manager\", whom we do not believe was the True manager of this place, he said \"oh I don't know your table ordered so you have to be charged\" and then walked away from us without listening to anything we had to say. He went as far as to threaten us saying he would call the police if we were not willing to pay for our extra salsa.   It is safe to say that we will NEVER be returning here. We will NEVER recommend this restaurant to anyone we know. If you are looking for good service and good food you this is not the place for you.",

    "text": "Let's see... When I went here this evening for dinner I had high hopes. Coworkers absolutely raved about the food. Even Yelp said that I'd been here twice but left no reviews. So I looked through the vast menu as I perused some very watery salsa & decided on the Deluxe Burrito with beef. Literally 2 minutes later I received a piping hot plate of food! Chef Mike must be playing his A game tonight I thought. While the food was piping hot it had no flavor at all. So I ordered a small dish of fresh jalapenos & they had no flavor or heat! It was a definite WTF moment for me because I started to have an inkling of why I hadn't submitted any previous reviews. Azteca may have some good dishes but the Deluxe Burrito isn't one of them. I felt like I was in an upscale Taco Bell except that my burrito was $20 after the drink, tip & taxes were factored in instead of the $5 or $6 that Taco Bell would've charged. Now that I have a review up I'll remember why it is that I don't eat here.",

    "text": "Incredibly disappointed in Azteca for the way they handle my most recent take-out order. I have been a loyal returning customer since moving to Charlotte last year. Unfortunately I will no longer be giving them my business. We ordered some nachos, a shredded beef taco salad and a side order of rice and beans...upon pickup my boyfriend who left his wallet in our other vehicle without realizing asked if he could Apple Pay or give them card info to punch in - that wasn't a possibility so he drove all the way back home to get his wallet, on the way back for the second time he called to ask if the order can be made with fresh chips/new taco shell since whenever we eat INSIDE the restaurant it usually comes out soggy due to all the meat juices...the connection was so horrible and they disconnected. When he arrived he asked THREE different people to change the chips/shell, someone said \"it might be cold because of the lettuce but chips will be fine\", finally the manager says \"let me go back and check\" he walks from the bar, says everything is good and hands him our meal. Needless to say I couldn't even pick up a chip and my taco salad was completely fallen apart and disintegrated. I called and asked what could be done since this could have been corrected the THREE times it was asked for while in the store..MANAGERS response is \"you called an hour ago it's going to be soggy\"...but we asked for it to be remade for that exact reason, and was basically fooled into thinking it was when he handed the bag saying everything was good to go. Manager got extremely rude and defensive then HUNG UP ON ME. I called back and he said once you leave that it's our loss. Then HUNG UP again. My receipt was time stamped at 7:25pm and I called to complain about food at 7:38pm (I made 4 different calls because of the manager hang-ups). Disgusted with this management and unprofessionalism.",

    "text": "Please be ware when ordering at this restaurant. I visited the location on Friday and ordered the shredded beef chimichanga. As I cut open the chimichanga I noticed that all of the meat didn't look like it was shredded beef. At first I thought they had accidentally mixed in  some shredded chicken so I brought it to the attention of my waitress. She called over the manager and he proceeds to tell me that the shredded beef is mixed with pork... Excuse me sir, your menu does not state that it would be mixed with pork intact I paid an up charge for shredded beef.  He explains that this is how it is served so I sent the dish back and replaced it with a chicken one. By this time, my taste for the dish was ruined. Then when we got ready to check out we reviews our bill and noticed the prices was completely different from what was on the menu. So my questioned the waitress and she said that the price on the menu was the lunch price. We ask so where is the dinner price. She didn't have an explanation so she called over the manager. Same guy as before he advises that the system charges the dinner price after a certain time.  My coworker when was dinning with me asked well how was I supposed to know that. The waitress never said there was a difference plus we were given the lunch menu when we came in. She asked to see the dinner menu and he said that the menu he just claimed was the lunch menu was the dinner menu. To appease us he said he would charge us the lunch price but he never took our bill in or we to fix it. So we sat there  waiting for our waitress thinking she was going to correct it. When she came over to collect our money we told her that he was supposed to be correcting our bill and explained what the manager had previously stated to us. She went over to the manager and he claimed he never said he would charge us the lunch price.. she said he told her to just take $2 off.   There was 3 of us that was talking to the manager. We tried to get to come back to our table but he ignored us. So basically he lied to our face. Then to top it off when she went to cash us out we still never got the $2 off.  We were still charged regular price.. whatever that was bc we never saw anything with the dinner prices for the items we ordered.  Beware! Especially if u order shredded beef and if you are ordering as the price on the menu may not be the price you end up paying especially if it is after lunch hours.",

For starters, we like their queso dip and made-at-your-table guacamole (although I don't think they add lemon or lime to theirs?).    But the main course is almost always their cheese enchiladas, served with beans and rice.  They are larger than usual, and FULL of cheese.  Their beans used to taste like the canned variety, but they are much better now.  I like their rice as well.  Platters are huge, and we both always have leftovers.  As others have mentioned, service can be hit or miss.  It really depends on who you get.  Either way, we always return, because we just haven't found better cheese enchiladas in CLT.",

Oh yes, I have no experience as a waitress, so imagine me carrying those three drinks back to our table lol. We ordered the pollo con cream and Camarones con hongo. We agreed that our food lacked flavor. . The chicken seemed as if it was microwaved, and the shrimp was over cooked.

    "text": "This place is hit or miss. I've been watching way too many YouTube videos and had a massive craving for Mexican food. Should've saved my money.  I've been here many times before and it was usually a good experience. I'm sad to say that today was not one of them.   I ordered takeout - 2 Fiesta Burritos and a side of queso.  When I got home, I noticed one burrito was overflowing with cheese while the other barely had any on It. They placed the sides in a separate container- rice, refried beans and cabbage slaw. Well one dish was missing the slaw. The rice was hard and stuck together in lumps. The worst part is the beans - they were dry dry dry dry. It wasn't even mashed right. Barely mashed beans, most of It was still whole. I tried to mash them myself and the plastic fork broke. Taking a bite out of dry hard pinto beans is so not what I expected. I trashed the beans.   The hostess who took my order was very nice and the food came out fast which is why I gave 3 stars. I took two off for the horrible beans and inconsistent food quality and quantity.   Next time I have a Mexican food craving, I'll hit up a taco truck.",

The pico is served with lettuce mixed in, at least that's happened to me twice in the five plus times I've eaten here.  Makes for harder eating with the chips.  It doesn't do much flavor wise.  You can never go wrong with the fajitas.  (Except the shrimp, they were not seasoned and seemed to be added as an afterthought.). The beans are also good.  Rice is usually dry and lacks flavor.  Cheddar cheese is what's used here.  I wish they didn't; I love and prefer the traditional white cheese.",

    "text": "I've tried a number of Mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area and this one is by far the BEST. The food is well seasoned but not overbearing with Adobo like many Mexican restaurants here like to do. Rather you can taste it in the food that natural herbs and spices have been used like good home cooking. I have tried the shrimp burrito which isn't on the menu but can be custom made for a small upcharge from the steak burrito. The burrito was loaded with shrimp and not something average you would get from Chipotle. My favorite dish was the combination plate that has steak, chicken, and quesadillas. The chicken and steak were extremely moist and flavorful. Of the three, I would have them make the quesadillas chicken instead of churizo because I wasn't a fan of that meat. The prices are very reasonable and family friendly. Definitely check out the pomegranate cheesecake because it is nothing one can ordinarily get somewhere and it's all natural goodness.  If you want a winner for your buck then this should be your next visit.",

If you like tortilla chips with cheese dip, get ready to pay.  $6.50 for the cheese dip and only 2 bowls of chips before you pay $3 for a refill.  The deluxe burrito was plain and lacking any taste.  I'd compare to a burrito from Taco Bell drowning in half a container of sour cream.  The temperature I admit was scolding hot, but that was only because of Senor Mike in the back.  The food arrived, no joke, 2 minutes after ordering, so you know some authentic cooking occurred.  That microwave must get used heavily.  How Americans think this is good mexican food really befuddles me.  We saw many hispanics inside and became even more confused that they would enjoy eating this mockery of the mexican culinary experience.  1st and last time for us.",

We only saw her again after my husband walked over to the bar to complain that we haven't even had water refills. The bartender was surprised but no apologies. We asked for a manager and only then did our waitress see him and run in the back to get our food. She blamed the kitchen for being slammed but once I touched the plate I knew she either forgot us or didn't care about her table since the plates and food were cold.  We only get to eat out once a month due to budget and we weren't waisting our time or money here. Once the food was dropped off no one checked on us or the food. We walked out, left the food on the table. Again we only had chips, salsa, and water. They were not slammed or even busy. And no manager ever came out.",

I use to order Arroz Con Pollo for years at Azteca on Woodlawn before the one near NorthLake Mall was built.  But ever since the one on Smith Corners Blvd was built, I am a more frequent customer because it's closer. Now I order Fiesta Jalisco. I am addicted.......you know I have to wash it down with a margarita or two!!!",

My friend ordered vegetarian salad and he brought ham salad. We asked him to get new vegetarian salad and he just removed ham on top and brought the same salad which is very annoying for vegetarian guys. Not only messed up the order but the way he talks the way he responds. We asked him to get drinks menu and he forgot that. We asked him to get salsa and he forgot that. The other guys who were serving other tables kind of sensed that we are waiting on something and brought us the menu and salsa. Might ruin your experience too. Think before you go here. I will never go to this restaurent.",

Of any restaurant in Charlotte this seems to be about the most consistent if ever been to. I've honestly never had a bad meal here no matter what I get. We usually have  large combo's  ...all under $10.-. You have to ask for some of their salsas,salsa verde, pico de gallo, and salsa de la drilla (nice heat) (all free..just ask) when they bring chips.  Huge portions, reasonably priced home made everything! Their signature carne asada, skirt steak flame broiled to your liking is excellent, and that is around $14.- Their sweet tea is good but if you want to step out try their horchada/rice almond milk with a sweet cinnamon spice..awesome! We drive 40 miles round trip to go here.  I'm glad it's not closer, we'd probably sell our stove.",

For starters the Camarones de Mexicano was loaded with salt and the Pork Carnitas had barely any meat (mostly fat). When I explained to the waiter that the Camarones de Mexicano had too much salt and that people at our table suffer from high blood pressure. He replied \"Next time let us know sooner so we can make the adjustment\". I find that interesting since there was more than 3/4 of the meal on the plate and the food was on our table for only 15mins. Needless to say our frustration was reflected in the tip. There's always room for professional development or customer service training.",

This is the best Mexican food I have found thus far in my short tenure in Charlotte.  I have been here almost ten times and I haven't had a bad experience so far.  Now, I don't order the combo dishes, I typically get something like Pulpo, or some chicken, seafood, or meat dish - reliable broad spectrum quality.  I am getting excited about my next visit just writing this.  I envision my next entrance with me bobbling up on a donkey as I rock out a poncho with sombrero and sunglasses with a fork in a napkin sheath.  Don Quixote can inspire.

I ordered a combination of enchilada, taco, and tamal.  The taco consisted of mostly shredded lettuce.  The tamal was chicken, I was expecting pork.  And while there were no noticable flaws with the chicken enchilada, it really had no flavor.  The plate was huge but it was filled mostly with rice and beans.  Another flaw was I ordered an unsweetened iced tea and while the original order was correct, the refills were not.  This happens a lot in Mexican places.  If I wanted to drink sugar water with tea coloring, I would have ordered it!  And the worst thing of all from this experience is it sat with me the rest of the night...and not in a good way.",

The menu is large, something for everyone's taste.  Our sever was with us immediately and we had our drinks in minutes.  Complimentary chips and salsa (with pink chips) were very good!  We both ordered a taco salad and it did not disappoint!  Large portion of ground beef in a tasty shell!  Our beverages never went below half, and as a plate was finished, it was removed.  I couldn't leave without trying the flan, another excellent choice!  We left feeling full and had two drinks, chips and salsa, two taco salads, and a dessert for less than $24.  As we were leaving, every member of the staff we walked by said goodbye and thanked us.  In a time when it is difficult to have employees pay attention to you (because they are on their phones or talking to each other), that was definitely not the case here!  Nicely done!",

The obvious pro being the accessibility to great food and drink (generally Dos Equis or Modelo for me), followed swiftly by the obvious con of un-doing your exercise routine for the day.   But in any case, I generally enjoyed this restaurant with the exception of cost. In the grand scheme of things, it isn't necessarily pricey. It is generally comparable to other Mexican restaurants. For me, if I'm looking for a quick, around-the-corner Mexican restaurant- this is definitely the place to be. If I'm looking to penny-pinch, I'd drive a few minutes down WT Harris towards the university and hit up Zapatas (my absolute fan favorite).   I generally liked every other aspect of this establishment. The atmosphere and decor were set perfectly for a Mexican restaurant. Good ambiance. The food was well prepared and was pretty delectable. Beer was flowing. The service was spot on. What more can you ask for really?   There were specials here, which most looked appealing.   Definitely worth a try!",

While we waited for our food I took in the decor and noticed how outdated and dingy everything seemed. I started to feel a little uncomfortable because the place looked like it hadn't had a thorough cleaning in forever. Our menus were dirty and grimy too. The food arrived and my taco was soft and mushy and the shell split right down the middle and the mushy beef filling spilled onto my plate. My chicken taco was only half filled and tasteless. My boyfriend ordered a sizzling fajita and offered me a taste. It tasted way better than the tacos. He ordered a Mojito and he was shocked when an electric green liquid came out. It was literally the color of green kool-aid or some crazy kiddie drink and it had little green flecks floating in it. We assumed the flecks were bits of mint but the drink had no mint flavor at all. It did have plenty of alcohol but no other real flavor. We may give them another try but will most likely try a different location.",

You won't find your palate wanting when you eat here. The service is excellent and the management is second to none.   Five-out-of-five stars, Azteca Family Restaurant is a six.",

    "text": "Had dinner and drinks at Azteca this weekend with a friend of mine. The restaurant itself is quite large and had a festive aura. Upon arriving, I sat at the bar (as I waited for my friend) and had a top shelf margarita. The margarita itself was strong. As a bartender, I tend to like mine a bit more subtle w the alcohol, but I'm a bit crazy like that. The bartender was affable and hard at work. He ran the bar nicely.  When my friend arrived we grabbed a table. No reservations on weekends keep in mind. Our server was quiet and a bit hurried. I understand that because it was a Saturday night. When we did order (burritos and a chicken dish in a cream sauce) our food came quickly. The chips that came with salsa were bland and too thick to me. The entrees themselves were on plates larger than a small country. It was aesthetically funny to look at. Our meals were good. Not amazing but not bad. I will say the chorizo burrito was quite tasty though.   The pricing was inexpensive. Like most Mexican places, you get a lot of food for the $$.  Would I return. Yes. For what is in the area, Azteca is a decent spot for a quick and filling Mexican dish.",

    "text": "The size of this restaurant is absolutely much more roomier compared to the South Blvd. location. If you've been to one of the Aztecas in mid or lower Charlotte, then you won't expect to see anything different on the menu. However, what you can expect to see is a change in staff every six months or so. I believe they've changed owners once or twice during the time they've been open and have shuffled around the waiting and managerial staff. For the better though. They seem much more helpful and coordinated with their food runs and service.   The food of the restaurant is decent and hits the spot. There isn't really anything special with their enchiladas, tacos, or tamales. I'm not an expert on Mexican cuisine, so I could be totally wrong, but those three items seem to be pretty uniform at any Mexican restaurant. The thing that really bothers me though is the lower quality of meats they have switched to. The chicken tastes like it comes from a Swanson Chicken can and the ground beef they use is the highest amount of fat possible.   HOWEVER, those are the combos. If you really want the \"quality\" meat and flavor, then you have to go to their speciality items or fajitas and pay a little more money for quality. Nothing wrong in that, amigos. Having learned that the combos aren't really good anymore, I've switched to the Carne Asada and the meat is muchhhh better! Now I actually feel like I'm spending my money for a good reason. Fajitas are starting to show a little more bell peppers & onions than meat lately, so they're starting to slack on that, but the fajitas are pretty standard once again.   I gave it four stars because of the lack of quality they're starting to go to now (I know, the economy excuse), but everything else is great in the restaurant. Friendly staff, clean tables, and decent prices for dinner. Lunch prices are excellent, so don't be afraid to come here for a quick bite if you don't want the same old $5 sub down the road.",
