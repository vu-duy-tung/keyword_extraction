My fiance and I ordered the Fire Tuna Kim Bap (similar to sushi, but no raw fish), the broccoli salad (with a siracha-sesame drizzle), the potato swirl, and the soy garlic tofu. The sauce on the tofu was SO GOOD!  There was also plenty of other stuff I'd be willing to try, especially if you catch me on a meat-eating day!",

    "text": "Date of Visiting + Reason: 11/10/17 at night for a birthday dinner  This is probably my 4th time going to Seoul and I must say, they do keep up consistency ESPECIALLY when it comes to their service.   So, this is what I had:  (i) Small Wings (6 pc, 1/2 & 1/2) - The wings always come out hot, crispy, & they don't skimp on the sauce. I always ask for a little extra. [SN: The only downside is that they seem to be 'cocky' by not providing ranch or blue cheese. I don't care how good your wings are, they make it BETTER for sure (especially if it's too spicy for some customers)].   (ii) Fire Squid Kim Bap - This was relatively ok. The squid needs to be a lot more spicier and the kim bap (I know it's not sushi) needs to be more composed. What I mean by that is 'tighter' so it will not fall apart. I really couldn't experience eating the whole thing because it just kept disintegrating & I had to combine every component individually; even though it was \"wrapped\" up.   (iii) A pint of SAPPORAO - I mean, you can never go wrong with beer.   Decor: Mediocre - I like the outside area(s) more and the private karaoke rooms ++++++++  Service: NOW, THIS IS WHERE THEY EXCEL! I would give their service, alone, about a 4.80/5.00 and that's only because I had to remind our server to bring my extra sauce. :-)  All in all, Seoul is an awesome place for a date, birthdays, casual get-togethers,  sports, etc. If you come to South End, make sure you visit Seoul. You will not be disappointed.   --TrizzyO_o",

    "text": "After almost a year, I finally put my first visit to Seoul behind me and decided to give them a second chance. The good news is, I didn't get sick this time! The bad news is, the good news stops there. Everything about this visit was just off. Service was off. Timing of the dishes was off. Food quality was waaaaaaaay off. They were even off on our table, giving our wings to the group beside us.   We ordered a lot of food and none of it was even what I'd consider average except for the wings, which as mentioned earlier, we had to ask the table beside us for when one of the waitresses dropped them off and left them there despite that table telling her the wings weren't theirs... So, besides the average wings, we had: - Tofu taco = disgusting with soggy/wet tofu and a cold, store-bought flour tortilla  - Bulgogi sausage = nothing special, a little tough and dry - Pulled pork = a little soggy, no distinct flavor unless you doused it in the spicy hoisin sauce  - Ramen Mac = also disgusting, giant pile of plain ramen noodles dumped in a paper boat (so, the ramen at the bottom stuck to the paper) with a gross cheese sauce carelessly pooled on top; we had to mix it up ourselves to coat all the noodles  - Potato swirl = not as awful as the rest but desperately needed seasoning  - Sriracha cracklings = Ok but should really be  billed as an app, not a side   Our server offered no help or explanation of the menu, even when asked. I had to prod him to explain what the fruit punch and egg nog beers were all about. We had various servers all night long, and no one ever checked in or asked what we thought of the food. This despite them clearing trays with half-eaten items.    We were one wing in to our apps when our dinner order appeared. There wasn't even enough room at the table to put the tray down so the sever just awkwardly stood there, staring at us until we cleared a few things away ourselves so he could drop the tray.   Such a shame this place isn't better. The concept (Asian BBQ joint) is great but the execution falls way short!",

The chicken wings are excellent - the crispy skin and yummy flavor make them winners all around.  The chicken breast was very flavorful and tender - delicious.  The sweet potato birds nest was also a nice side.  Service is quick, atmosphere is casual and kind of hipster.  Don't come here expecting a lot of greens (although they do have broccoli which looked lonely on our table among the large amount of MEAT).",

    "text": "Seoul is a neat spot in a quietly booming area that includes Unknown, Craft, and Lady M Cakes. I've been here a few times, but my most recent visit was on a whim with my wife (because cooking is time consuming and we were already hungry). Overall Seoul is a unique experience in the Charlotte scene that boasts an amazing meat selection, creative cocktails, and a great presentation for sharing.   When starting off with a drink, don't be afraid to go off the norm and try something other than the local craft beers. While I got a Sapporo on draft during my most recent visit, our waiter encouraged me to try the yogurt soju on a previous visit. It was an impressive display hitting the table still in the shaker while smoking from the addition of dry ice, and was an overall hit at the table.  Getting to the meat of the restaurant, the portions are large and come out on a large tray to promote sharing (think family style, but with an edgier presentation). My wife and I got a small serving of wings, pork belly (one of the best in the city), and ribs and were unable to finish everything. Also don't make the rookie mistake we did and only order meats. They have some neat sides that are worth trying.  Again, Seoul is a unique addition to Charlotte and I would certainly encourage others to try. Also be sure to watch the K-Pop music videos playing in the background for some unexpected entertainment!",

Eventually if you wait it out, you'll be pleased to try the baked ram (ramen) & Cheese, damn it is amazing. The brisket and ribs are good, but the accompanying sauce is a bit spicy and distracts from complimenting the bbq. The soy garlic wings are sweet and tasty, however the batter is laid on a bit thick and makes it a bit much on the crunchy side. I tried a fat brisket bulgogi taco and it was amazing and flavorful.  Overall, it is a good spot to try with friends and they also have karaoke rooms if you feel like getting hammered and forcing everyone to join in on Wonderwall. Come through.   Got it? Good.",

The only disappointment was that I ordered a fruit infused water from the adult beverage menu expecting a home made concoction but it was just a can of Truly. I was still thrilled with the food and atmosphere though.",

Granted they just opened not long ago, I didn't want to be too cruel, however, I could use a drink and a knife with my food.   Drinks - got lychee martini: 1) they didn't have martini glass avail  (ok I didn't mind, just pour one in), 2) took a while for a refill 3) too sweet for my taste   Food - we ordered pork belly (REAL GOOD), kimchi sausage (eh, ok I suppose), noodle Mac and cheese (reminded me of canned cheese), dirty brown rice (seasoning on point! Ask for more on a side!), deviled picked eggs (not enough marinate for me - personally).   Would I give it another shot? May be for a beer outdoors.   P.s. We asked if they can put the game on, we walked out with an epic review of Korean videos!",

    "text": "First of all, the wings here are HUGE! If you want an abundant amount of meat, definitely order the wings. Seriously, you will get full off of 5 or 6 of them.  I prefer the soy garlic flavor over the spicy bbq because it is more flavorful and the sweetness paired up with the garlic is very satisfying. However, I do think the wings need some work on holding the flavor in-once you get past eating the skin everything tastes bland and that is probably because there was so much meat left. I had to order the kimchi coleslaw (which tasted like like regular coleslaw, I don't know where the kimchi comes in) to help me finish the rest of the wings.   Then, the crispy pork belly was overpowering in flavor-as in it was too salty in my opinion, especially after eating the wings. It tasted great with the bao bun but by itself I would not be able to eat more than two bites. The pork belly skin was super crunchy though, the crispest I have ever had actually. I would probably order this again with a side.  Finally, the pulled pork was the only meat entree I actually enjoyed and would order again in a heartbeat. It is packed full of southern barbecue flavors and had the perfect amount of vinegar in it. I was able to eat this by itself but paired with the bao buns the taste is out of this world. I highly recommend trying this one out!   Overall, the food was average and some of the meats were too greasy. The meat dishes are hard to eat by itself but if paired with the right sides like bao buns and potato swirls, it could taste a lot better. I wish some of the sides came with the meats though because paying $4 per side makes my wallet cry. The service is great when slow but poor when busy. I would probably come back next time and order only the pulled pork and try out a couple of drinks because soju is awesome.",

My wife and I went there a few weeks ago and their menu was updated, offering even more surprises and delicious eats! We cannot rave enough about the fire chicken. It is such a unique dish and the portion is worth every penny. Their portions in general are great.  I also recommend the sweet potato nest and the Choiang broccoli to add a little green to your plate (because you may want to/need to make room for the ramen mac and cheese).  Drinks are reasonably priced - they have a full bar which is great for everyone.  Atmosphere- laid back and casual.  Finally, I feel they offer a little bit of everything if you have people with allergies or are just picky eaters in general. Update: Kim bap bulgogi and the Seoul margarita- get them!",

There also are several karaoke rooms if thats your thing, which is nice. This is a very fun place to visit, sing your heart out, play some games, and have a few drinks with friends.  Now on to the food. I went with the soy garlic wings, which were amazing. They have a breading on them and were fried perfectly. They don't offer ranch or blu cheese, but you won't need it. The flavor was great and the wings were large. Definitely some of the better wings I've had in Charlotte.   Parking is street parking, so I'm not sure how busy this gets during peak. It is also a few streets over from the train which is nice. I'll definitely be visiting again.",

Annnnd...the spicy red wings were good...and the fire dipping sauce was good. Everything else was not. The soy wings were not tasty..bland and boring. The spring rolls had beef and pork inside and looked very processed/not at all fresh. When I told the waiter, he said he could get me something else, but was quick to add, wouldn't take the rolls of the check. Why? I don't like them, the flavor was gross, and I will be hungry because I'm not eating them. That's fine, I didn't complain for the money. I hoped to get something more edible, but I decided against ordering anything else if their policy is to charge you no matter if you hate the food or not . I've not liked  much of anything they have, so why waste time and money. Ram Mac was extremely boring...and extremely tasteless. The taco was also not great.   The customer service was poor, a huge disappointment. And I wasn't happy again with this place. The drinks are the only decent looking things, as I saw some being delivered to a nearby table. I didn't feel like sticking around to try them, though.",

The wait was over 45 minutes long thankfully it was well worth it. As soon as we were brought to the table: our server came right over to introduce him self, took our drink order, and gave us a run down of the menu. He also made great some recommendations. We had a few things off the menu including wings of both flavor options, kimchi fries and swirl potato. Despite the place being completely slammed the food was out Quick! Back to the food.  THE STAR OF THE SHOW ARE THE WINGS! These were the crunchiest, juiciest most flavorful wings I have ever had. If I can recommend anything it would be the wings.   Kimchi fries were delicious crispy and super flavorful. The only down side.. they were so cold!   Potato swirl was good crispy lightly flavored comes with a great spicy sauce. But it was also sooo cold and felt like it had been pre cooked a few hours prior.   T",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of Seoul. They've got great food, a great selection of drinks & cocktails, karaoke rooms, and a pretty cool outdoor space that includes many games and even a dog run area for your pups to party.   Food wise, a must order is their Korean style wings. Go for the half & half to try both sauces, although I think the soy garlic is the clear winner. After that, I'd recommend going with the Fire chicken. Add a side of bao buns to make some little sandwiches with the chicken, you'll thank me later. Pork belly is decent.   For sides: potato swirl is good & the ramen mac & cheese is a must try just because. The sweet potato nest is pretty solid, although they're like string fries so if you don't like that, I'd skip these.   Overall, a great place that you definitely won't regret visiting.",

Spicy wings were much more flavorful then the other option. Got the kimchi fries as a side and was well worth price and calories, the bulgogi beef on top was a wonderful touch.   Washed down the the food with a fruit punch beer that was really light and refreshing...place was jam packed even on a rainy Sunday afternoon, and servers were pretty attentive. Friend did have the tofu option and literally took one bite and thought was disgusting, but who's eating tofu at a place w meet in title right.",

    "text": "Seoul Food Meat Company is truly as good as it gets.  I've had a couple of dreams about how good their wings are. Like legitimately I've told people in my dreams that they have to have the best KFC wings and that would be at Seoul.  The atmosphere of the entire restaurant is pretty upbeat and fun, with open seating, a good bar area, and TV's all over the place. I'd say if you're in a hurry, come back when you've got some time to spend to appreciate the food because this food deserves your time and full attention. Also side note, it gets pretty packed here so it's not really an in and out kind of place.  I started off the night with the pineapple margarita. I'm not much of a pineapple fan, but I thought this was pretty delicious, especially with the coffee/sugar around the rim. Definitely a unique spin on it! Probably could have had a little more booze, but it was tasty nonetheless.  Once we were seated, we ordered the kimchi fries and the crispy pork belly. The kimchi fries were so good and a great way to start. They're pretty messy so it's fun reaching in to the middle of the table with your fork or fingers to get the fries over to your side of the table.   The crispy pork belly actually surprised me a little bit. I'm usually not the biggest fan of pork belly only because it usually has so much fat left that hadn't been rendered down. It was NOT the case here, and each piece really was crispy on one end and super tender on the other. The sauce served with it was perfect.  Now for the main star of the evening. The WINGS. There really isn't that much to say other than the flavor is a 10 and the crunch is a 10. We got half and half soy garlic/spicy. I wasn't the biggest fan of the spicy but hands down the soy garlic were the best wings of my life. If that's what you want, come here.  I'll be back very soon to have those sweet, sweet wings. There's a bunch of other sides that need exploration, too. CAN'T WAIT.",

Unfortunately, even though it was 75 outside, they had a tent up over the patio still. I feel like this was a pretty busy oversight since the sides could easily be rolled up. We ended up sitting on the front patio so that we could be outside.   I love their food. I've had a large portion of the menu in the past. The ramen Mac and cheese is one if my favorites and the tacos are also quite good. All of the meat I've had are amazing. The wings are my favorite wings I've ever had. They are crispy and delicious. I love the soy garlic and my husband loves the spicy BBQ. We of course had to get them this time too.   They have $1 sides until 5:30 which is a great deal, so we had to get something. We decided to go with the soy pickled deviled eggs and they were amazing. They are now my favorite deviled eggs. The soy added great flavor.    Our service was pretty bad this time. We did have a really big group, but I couldn't get more water the entire time even though I asked multiple times. Others had the same problem.   There are so many good things on the menu, you really can't go wrong. I recommend coming with a group and getting a bunch of things to share!",

Stick to beer if you want to have a good time without breaking the bank. They have some specialty cocktails that are fun at first, but leave you wondering why you bothered spending the money (gimmicky). The food is over priced for what it is. I'd rather spend my money on other restaurants. It's not that the food isn't good, it's just that you can get similar or better somewhere else for better price points.   We did have an issue with our evening that we tried to address with the manger, but we were unable to resolve it amicably. For this reason, I probably won't go back.",

Our server did not seem happy to be there but answered our questions.  I had ordered a tea which took longer to deliver than our food order.  Our food was cold and when we shared this with our server, she had to \"get the manager.\"  The second round wasn't much better but the server said \"it looks right to me.\"  I am not sure how you can look at food to measure the temperature.  Last note on the service - I had asked for honey to go with my cornbread.  I was told by the server and then a manager that the owner has a tightly controlled inventory and the honey was only for a specific item on the menu.  Who tells a customer this???   I had heard that the wings were some of the best in the city.  Not True.  Won't be back.",

    "text": "I did not want to go here; because, it's Non traditional Korean food. It's not traditional Korean food; but, it's the best of Korean Bar food!   We went with the kiddo to meet the family.  The hostess took our name down and when asked how long is the wait; her response was all the tables are full and when they get up, I will let you know when it's your turn. Honest answer for a bar serving bar food on a Friday night! Bad place for a Mommy and Daddy with two sleepy kids at 6:00 at night. But my single brother picked! Go figure!!!   We waited 30 minutes and them started to explore the building. The bar was nice but people continued to walk down a back hallway with bottles of liquor. Our adventures payed off and we found an outside bar with a super mega tent over the whole back deck and a mega GAME area!!!   Flip cup or beer pong for the young; but, husband and the kiddo found pool soccer??!!! Awesome fun!  It's now my husband new favorite game!  But wait... we got a table .  In a private room?   Because it's also a norebang! (No-day-bong) private room with two mics, two tambourines, 1000 plus songs, korean Kpop dancers, and a karaoke machine!!!  Written in Korean! What!  The waitress was kind and let us know how the machine worked with putting songs in a cube and skipping songs. So we finally ordered food.   Then the meats came: Beef ribs- fall off the bone awesome meat!   Crispy pork belly- omg loved it    Fried whole Tilapia- my absolute favorite. It's great you get the head and tail too!  100% band for your buck.   Half and half wings - okay not as good as smoked wings. Taste the same warm or cold. Either way good with a cold beer. (Hint good bar food)   White rice    WAY OVER PRICED! Really it's just white rice! $4 a bowl which would buy you a giant 10lb bag of rice!   Soy pickled Deviled Eggs - yummy   Kimchi Vinegar Slaw- had a lot left over.   Full rack of ribs- huge! Fall off the bone! Everyone devoured this bad boy!    I think the manager stated 1/2 price norebang during the Sunday- Wednesday. My oldest asked to have her birthday party here! Lol",

The spicy bbq are a bit messy. The wings are large in size but seem to lack the meat for the size of the wing. Lastly, the fish taco was interestingly amazing, I must say I wasn't expecting it to taste as good as it did. Whatever the sauce was on the fish taco I would advise they keep that around! The staff were very welcoming, we told them we were first timers and they definitely made a great first impressions. The timing from the servers was near perfect, no one server was overwhelming and they all worked very well together. The food is fairly priced and the atmosphere was relaxing. Parking can become a bit of a hassle during peak hours but overall I enjoyed the experience. I would definitely recommend this place to someone. This will also become a part of my restaurant rotation.",

My boyfriend and I visited and we ordered the collard greens, soy chicken wings, spicy bbq chicken wings, ram mac, philly egg rolls, and reuben egg rolls. After receiving our food my boyfriend took one bite of the reuben egg roll and did not like the taste and they were cold. We informed the bartender that he didn't like the reuben eggs rolls and asked if we could have it removed from the receipt. He stated that he would get the manager, again he was very professional and helpful. The manager came and we expressed our issues with her, she stated that she couldn't remove the item that we had to pick another item, which we didn't want. The restaurant basically will force you to order a different item and won't allow you to return the item to be taken off the bill. I think that the restaurant should reevaluate their policy. The issue wasn't the cost or paying, it was the fact that the quality of the food wasn't good and we didn't want to substitute it for anything else. Having said that, I'm not interested in returning any time soon.",

I really like the potato salad the Philly cheesesteak eggroll and the corn. I thought that it was going to have way more Korean flavors and I thought it was going to be more of the dim sum style since they said the food comes out whenever. I thought it was heavy on Southern influence. The food is super oily but I believe they use rice bran oil? The wings are really good but I've had way better Korean or Japanese style wings. I thought the service was really wonderful; the place was not busy at all and you have your own personal waiter. They have Korean music playing on TV. There is a bar and a nice patio. Happy hour is definitely time to go 4-5pm $1 sides. You really only need 1-3 sides. Lots of Parking out back. If you are a very picky person and you come here when it's busy you're begging for trouble.   The price is very good except for the meat items $23 for rib? Dang would have definitely liked the opportunity to try that. I'd also like to try the drink in the pineapple.",

Our server was Dylan and he was an awesome server and very sweet and attentive. He asked if we were there for a special occasion and my husband told him it was my birthday. They didn't sing to me thank goodness but they did give me complimentary champagne!   We started off with the wings half and half. They are not lying when they say it's JUMBO. Wings were delicious and had a great flavor to it. We also got the pickled deviled eggs. I got the fire chicken (small portion) and my husband got the crispy pork belly. The fire chicken was good! I wish it had more sauce to it. The small portion was huge. The crispy pork belly was good but they are not joking when they say it's crispy!! We got a side of \"dirty\" rice. The sauce that came with it was good but I could do without it or less sauce. The food came out quick!   Overall, we had a great experience here. Atmosphere was great. Food was awesome. The manger/owner came by and checked on us and that was a nice gesture. Dylan, once again was awesome!!",

I prefer wingette size.  Flavour:  soy garlic: blend of perfection..a salted garlicky.sweetness.  bbq: so good and a splendid take on bbq sauce.  Overall I try to hit them up every 2 weeks for the wings that I will now order as mixed for the sauces..it's a meal that you don't have to dip or pour anything on...they do it, sooo well for you.welcome.",

    "text": "I am super happy that yelp suggested this place to me. With this being my 1st Time in Charlotte I had absolutely no idea of where to go. I was sad that I could only order from the late night menu because I really wanted to try their beef ribs, being that I don't eat pork and not many places offer beef ribs. What I ordered from here were their wings (20 of them yum) they have garlic and spicy bbq, which were both amazing! But my fav would have to be the garlic. Along that we order the \"fat brisket bulgogi taco\" which was so juicy with so much flavor. It had just the perfect crunch with the pickled veggies. We also got both the beef bulgogi and fire squid Kim Bap. Now the beef was drier than I've had before so I wasn't much of a fan but the fire squid gave me life. It was juicy and tender and I definitely wanted more. We also tried one of the local craft beers to go along with our meal. Now for all of this food our bill was less than $40 bucks, can you say winning!! Lol. This would be a place I would want to revisit if I ever return to Charlotte. They also have multiple rooms to have your own personal karaoke party which seemed really cool. Along with an outside bar with multiple games like corn hole and more. We didn't get to enjoy any of those festivities because we were super hungry and tired at the same time. But if you go make sure you check all they have to offer out!",

It was packed so we grabbed three seats at the bar and each started off with a beer. I would definitely recommend the soju even though I did not order it, I watched the bartenders make a few and it looked amazing.  Plus it was served in the fruit that you ordered (I saw watermelon, coconut, and pineapple).    Three of us split the following:  Cripsy Pork Belly (small), too salty for my liking Pulled Pork (small), amazing! I highly recommend the pork.  Soy Ginger Wings, the best thing that I ate at Seoul! The skin was perfectly breaded and so crispy. Pimento Corn Cheese, I personally enjoyed this dish but others in my party did not care for it Choiang Broccoli, fresh and delicious  Collards  Excellent food with an awesome staff, I would definitely recommend this restaurant!",

The customer service was awesome the staff came around continuously to make sure we were ok and even held convos with us about the food and what are favorites were. The best part is it was happy hour which happens every Monday-Thursday from 4:30 to 5:30 so all the side dishes were just $1. I'll definitely be back:)",

The server (forgot his name) was so friendly and welcoming with a sense of humor and he made our visit absolutely enjoyable. Ordered the ribs which were delicious and the potato salad was great! Ramen mac and cheese was a unique concept but I wouldn't go back for it.   My only issue is the size of the tofu. While the sauce is delicious, the tofu blocks are cut too large so it makes it hard to taste the sauce on every bite of tofu. My only advice would be to cut the tofu into smaller bite size blocks so the sauce doesn't disappear and it's easier to eat :)",

    "text": "Fantastic atmosphere, attentive service, and delicious food - no complaints here! The fella and I stopped in around 5 pm on a Saturday (I know, early bird special), and we were promptly seated. I loved the concrete floors and aluminum chairs (which were pretty comfy for aluminum) and the twinkly lights strung above. Even though it had an industrial feel, it was still cozy. And I did love the constant Asian rap videos/music playing... super fun vibe.  I wish I could tell you our waitress' name because she was so helpful and fun! She gave us the quick rundown on the menu, and we decided to try a little bit of everything. Here's how the food shook out:  - Small order of wings (6 total) half & half on the sauce: the wings are bigger than I expected, so I'm glad we went small. The fella loves a little heat, but the spicy wings were too messy for him. He needed a wet wipe and two napkins after just one wing. The soy garlic were amazing - great balance of sweet and salt. - Crispy pork belly: the fella's favorite, just okay for me. The fried part was so hard, I thought I was gonna crack a tooth. - Pulled pork : my favorite, by far. I almost got the meat sweats just from this. - Dirty white rice: pretty good, but just a dollop of a sesame/soy pasty dressing on top of white rice. - Potato swirl: not really spicy like they say, but they do sprinkle sriracha dust on the spiral. The sauce it comes with didn't add anything to it. Pretty darn tasty.  All that plus two glasses of wine and a Red Clay cider cost just under $70. A steal!  They have a ton of drink options, too - local craft beer, Asian craft beer, cider, wine, cocktails, sake, and other fun options. We sat at the bar for an after-dinner drink and saw waitresses carving up huge watermelons and pouring liquor into them.  It was too hot the day we went, but there was also a pretty cool looking patio with umbrellas along Church St.  I know the reviews on this place have been mixed, and it's possible we were just there on their best day yet, but we couldn't find anything not to like about this place!",

This place conceptually is clever, they have karaoke rooms that you can rent, outdoor seating and a bar, games and a dog park, and has Korean music videos playing on flat screens throughout. Very new hipster CLT vibes, but a great place to bring the family for a fun night out, or erm day drinking for the younger crowd. I deff wouldn't call this place kid friendly, but I've been here with family ages 20-70 and we all had a great time.   Now on to the menu. The food comes out on giant trays for the table, and everything is served family style so you can try different stuff if you wish. Things I loved were: the bulgogi tacos, Ram Mac--fusion of ramen mac and cheese, the birds nest--sweet potato straws piled high, the pork belly, and the soy garlic wings--if you love wings these are for you (!) super crispy and crunchy with a savory and sweet sauce. The drinks are also clever and delicious, pineapple soju that comes in an actual pineapple, and the prickly pear cocktail are some faves.  All in all this spot has great customer service, creative food, and great vibes. Will continue to come back!",

However, it was the best thing that could have happened.  The service here was fantastic. Our waitress was training another person and still managed to provide excellent service with a smile. She explained the menu and dishes to us in detail. She answered all of our questions making it a pleasant atmosphere.  The manager even stopped by our table to give us a discount on a karaoke room for our next visit.  The food did not disappoint. The beef ribs were so tender and delicious. They were great on the bao buns with the homemade sauce. I loved the kimchi fries, and my wife really enjoyed the pimento corn cheese paired with the shrimp toast. We both loved our bulgogi spring rolls too. The portions were great and the prices too. We arrived during happy hour to find the sides for only a $1.  They have a inside and outside bar area with great music and karaoke rooms. They even have a pet friendly play area for your dog. We will definitely return and tell our friends.",

    "text": "I really love Korean food so I may be too picky but after going here twice, I did not like this place.  The menu items are titled well but don't live up to the name. Ramen Mac and cheese seems like it should be something amazing but it's ramen with cafeteria cheese on top.  The Kim chi sausage is bland and the guys at our table had fun coming up with analogies as to how dry it was (it's so post-apocalyptic wasteland it could win 6 oscars).  The sweet potato nest is sticky gooey and falls apart easily, making it hard to eat.  The chicken wings are breaded heavily and very sticky also.    The pulled pork and beef ribs are decent as is the Kim chi slaw and potato swirl.  The pimento cheese isn't bad either.  But honestly this restaurant is in south end; if you want great chicken wings, tavern on the tracks is up the road.  If you want pulled pork, you can check out saucemans or macs.  And if you're hankering for some good Asian fare, you're better off going to futo buta, nikkos, or ru sans.  The dishes that should differentiate this place from other restaurants are boring and bad and the dishes they do acceptably can be done better by nearby restaurants so unless one of those are too busy, I'd suggest going there.",

Even the trainee was very attentive to my water staying refilled. The food was fast and absolutely delicious. My brother and I decided to split an order of 20 half and half wings as well as some pulled pork and brisket tacos.  Between the two of us we still left with half of each taco as well as 10 wings because they are so big!  I have been raving about it since stepping out of the building. It was a very satisfying experience. Definitely on the list of places to suggest as I look forward to trying more things on the menu.",

And it certainly wasn't busy by traditional standards. We ordered the ramen mac and cheese as one of our sides and they brought out something that looked liked ramen with Wendy's chili poured over it. We immediately said we didn't order that and we won't eat it. The kid bartender said that's what we ordered and he can't switch it out, nor take it off the bill. I said we ordered the mac and cheese ramen, so bring it out. I wasn't going to argue. He would simply have to pay for it out of his tip. Perhaps he should write orders down if he can't remember them. Then as we were eating, we watched him do the same thing to a girl who ordered a drink. She told him she didn't order that drink, and again he said he can't take it off the bill. The drink sat on top of the cooler for 10 minutes and then he sold it to someone else. Smh.  As for the food, the brisket was on the dry side, lacked natural flavor, and had far too much fat. Both ramen dishes were underwhelming and basic. The pulled pork wasn't awful, but definitely forgettable. The pimento corn cheese was a tiny, tiny portion with way too many \"chips\" that were made of shrimp but were more like pork rinds. The fully loaded potato salad's flavor was bland, yet dominated by the taste of cucumber.  This place was such a disappointment.",

Let's start with the location - perfectly tucked away but still right in South End! plenty of parking to the side of the building.   Our server (it kills me that I can't remember her name) was so sweet and asked if we had dined there before. when we said we hadn't, she took her time explaining the menu to us.   Everything sounded so good, but we decided on the fire chicken, mac & cheese ramen, potato swirl, and sriracha cracklins. My favorite, hands down, was the ramen. IT WAS SO GOOD I was scraping the cheese off of the side of the cardboard container.   The fire chicken was so tender and juicy. We ordered a small and I still had enough to take home. The potato swirl was good and reminds me of festival food but with flair. Our least favorite were the cracklins, which were still good, but just kinda reminded us of spicy pork rinds.   We will definitely be back - soon! I wish I could give more kudos to our server as she really was the sweetest. They're inexpensive and they play super cool K-Pop videos that my friend and I couldn't stop watching.   Yum! :)",

They attempted to do an Asian style breading, on a bone-in chicken wing.  The breading was heavy and thick, and I was never confident whether I was biting into breading, chicken, or bone, until I had committed to the bite.  It's a strange way to eat chicken wings.  Aside from that, the atmosphere is great.  They have a nice patio with a view of uptown.  I really want to go back and try something else.

They offer an interesting variety of drinks and beers, with a couple of fun novelty drinks that are served in the actual fruit it's made from!   If there's one thing you positively can't miss at Seoul it is their wings. If you love oversized extra crispy wings with the most delicious sauce you've ever had this is your place. Go grab a seat at the bar outside, order a drink and embarrass yourself eating wings in front of all the millennials in South End like I do on a regular basis.",

Since they have this happier hour I try to make a point of only coming here during those times because how can you beat $1 sides!",

Their chicken wings are easily some of the best in town, I'm pretty sure that they have won some competitions over the past few years. I would really recommend getting anything that has the words bulgogi in it. The flavors are always really great, they did just raise the price of some of their sides but it's only by a dollar and if you pick the right ones that sound like they're good, then they usually are pretty good. I strongly suggest the pork, fish, or bulgogi taco. I'm not the biggest fan of their drinks, but let's be real, you go there for the food.",

We were looking for a place that was not exactly fast food since it was late at night and we wanted somewhat decent food. Seoul Food Meat Company was the ultimate life saver! The plus side is that they open late and they have some pretty awesome food to offer. They are a Korean-inspired restaurant with their own fusion.   Here's what we ordered: Crispy pork belly- You want crispy? You got it! This was everything! Sweet potato nest- This dish was completely unique for us. Tasted nothing like this before and so glad that we ordered it! Nice presentation too. Bulgogi fusion taco- This was just okay, which was what we expected, but needed something extra.   Overall, if we were to visit Charlotte again in the nearby area, we would definitely come back to Seoul Food Meat Company. Also good to mention that the staff was extremely friendly!   Note: If you want to order ahead for pick up, you need to leave your credit card information with them.",

We went a couple days ago, and my boyfriend got the fire chicken, which he said is now on his list of Top 5 chicken dishes haha. He also got chili, which he said was also delicious. I, being a vegetarian, got the potato swirl- one of the tastiest forms of potato I've ever had- and the tofu \"wings\"- lightly fried squares with sauce. Everything was spicy, flavorful, and delicious. I also loved that they had vegetarian options. Prices are moderate, and expect a wait as they get busy, especially on weekends. Look for a seat at the bar, or give your phone number and they'll call you when it's your turn for a table. It's a fun and high energy place that everyone who visits charlotte should definitely check out. Service was also extremely quick, and everyone was friendly! 10/10 stars!",

It's like a Korean version of a poutine. This can be a meal all it's own or split it with a friend if you are feeling generous.   The fire chicken is off the hook. I don't think it is exactly worthy of the term \"fire\" as far as spicy, but the grill flavor might be the goal of the name. The huge portion of five thighs for $9 (small) is more than a main course.   Other items I've tried are the tacos and pork belly. The pork belly is pricy but it's something really special. The hard crunch is really impressive since the meat is still really moist and juicy.   The space is pretty loud and this is speaking from the lunch rush. The food comes out as it is ready so the spacing of meals at a full table can be a little awkward.   The staff is always willing to explain items on the menu. They are quick to fill drinks and help when they can.",

Beer pong tables. Karaoke rooms. None of this bothered me except eating outside = a lot of flies which I didn't consider.   Had some frose which was delicious and a nice way to cool off. For my meal I had yummy watermelon lemonade to drink, their baf wings in sweet and mild and soy garlic, fat brisket bulgogi taco, pork belly spring roll, and bulgogi kim bap. Yes I had a lot. Lol. This was my first time here so I wanted to try everything. The meat in all of my dishes was cooked deliciously and very tender.   I honestly loved it all. The wings were so big and saucy. They were cooked well and crispy. The taco was yum I loved the aoli. The kim bap was nice and bite sized. The prices are pretty affordable. Definitely recommend this place if you want something different and might feel like stepping out of your comfort zone with some cool asian fusion. Also, if you don't mind a wait on a weekend.   Oh and also the service was great everyone I came across was really nice .",

Out back they have a great deck for drinking with buddies complete with corn hole, beer pong, and even a gaited dog park. I've regularly dined here and have always had great service.

The food came out really fast - and I was impressed with all of the dishes. The crispy pork belly was very tasty, not too crunchy and very flavorful. As a filipino who grew up with lechon kawali - this is probably one of the best crispy pork belly I've had. The green tea cornbread was so good, moist and you could definitely taste the green tea. The kimchi chili ramen was surprisingly delicious as well. The egg rolls and spring rolls were both on point, very crispy and flavorful.   I loved it so much I was tempted to come back after our show nearby just to come back for their happy hour for their $1 sides after 10pm.

Was the food good, yes , everything was prepared well but I just think I can't appreciate the Korean fusion cuisine.    I did like the sign on the door that stated \"We are not a traditional Korean restaurant \" lol. I even asked for chopsticks and it was a flat no, we don't have them . The foodie in me ordered a lot bc I wanted to try different stuff but it was a lot of food . Meats are a Lil pricey and sides you order separately at $4 a pop but you get plenty so it balances out.   I feel my Fried pork skins were a Lil too hard and lacked flavor unless I dipped them in the chili oil.  The green tea muffin I ordered it so my 2yr old would have something to munch on but he didn't like it , I tasted it and it was good just different.  The soy deviled eggs, hmmmm ... if you like soy sauce flavor go for it! Koreans use soy sauce in almost everything.  The kimchi coleslaw was my favorite , I should've ordered rice and just killed that. The bulgogi tacos were the winner , simple, flavorful , and decent size . Also it's the only thing the toddler, teen, and father ate .  I can see why this restaurant is popular , offering Korean flare to American style dishes . I would take a newbie foodie here to ease into the taste of Korean cooking.",

The deviled eggs are okay, I wouldn't get them again. However, the crispy pork belly is disappointing. I definitely will not get them again. They were too chewy and too salty. They do look so good though. I really like the chicken wings, even though I think they are a wee bit salty. I think they would be fine if you eat the radish with them, but I don't like radish so I just ate them alone.",

I'm not a heavy beef or pork eater but I wanted to get in on this new sensation. While it didn't disappoint, it was too heavy for me. But I can say that the Pork Belly and BbQ Ribs were outstanding. You'll need plenty of water if you get the meat platter. Short of giving it a five star is because the \"strongest\" cocktail there was not strong at all. And I'm a cocktail having Woman with my meal. The sides are a la carte, which is good so you can create your own meal. The game area is so cool with its kickball pool. Oh and it's dog friendly(the game area)",

    "text": "So this review is for two things. The food and the karaoke room.  I haven't had too much off the menu besides the wings. They are just so good it's hard to order anything else. They are huge and a little goes a long way. Try both flavors, you won't regret it. They offer a large selection of alcohol with interesting flavors,so be adventures.  Now the karaoke room. I threw a surprise party in the Rockstar room one Friday night.  They said the room holds 25-27, but unless it's children size people, keep it under 25. There's room, it's just cramped.we had  20 and it was perfect. It was hot in there and we had to constantly request for the air to be turned on. We had to keep opening the door so we could stop sweating. Eventually after we keep propping the door opened, they turned it on. Now the karaoke machine is all in Korean -_- .. i wasn't around for instructions, but everybody said it was complicated. Luckily we found one person who could somewhat figure it it. Unfortunately it def took time, figuring out how to find each song,out of our paid 2 hours.  They have a call button which really didn't make the server come in the room quicker. Food and alcohol came out in a timely manner. The karaoke itself had a decent selection of songs. The best part is that it's scored at the end of each performance. Makes it competitive. Overall i will definitely rent a room again, it was so much fun!! They also have different rooms for different size groups and special prices sometimes on a weekday!",

We order the beef brisket and it was so good. The meat was cooked to perfection. It melted in our mouth and the sauce was tangy but sweet, not overly one or the other. The BBQ blend went well with the meat. We added some sides like kimchee, rice and tofu. They all went well together. We left full and definitely satisfied. Next time, I want to try their fries and sushi that's \"not sushi\", it all looked so yummy!",

We are not from the area so we definitely crave this restaurant since there is nothing like it up North.   We had the beef rib which is really tasty and the sauce is delicious! Our recent time had a lot more fat than meat on it but it was still really great!  We also had the fire chicken which has a great amount of cheese on top of it!! It's not spicy but when you add the sauce which comes on the side, it certainly is hot! We also had the pulled pork which was really delicious and probably my favorite out of all of them but they are all so tasty!! We also ordered ramen mac and cheese which is delicious of course! I do wish the side was larger since we shared among 4 people. The potato swirl is delicious and the sauce is great but it is spicy too! The soy pickled deviled eggs are delicious especially if you like soy! We also green tomato kimchi which is really good and not spicy! This place serves food fast and service is good. We did have an error as they brought out pork belly in error which remained on our receipt but then took it off when they realized it.  I think they also have Sapporo on draft!  If you're in Charlotte and looking for a great place to try with tons of meat and unique dishes - come check it out! You won't regret it!",

It's 5 hours after my meal there and I'm still drooling at the thought of the ribs sandwiched between the baos and that dirty rice...so yummy! I would eat here everyday if I lived here.   This place is definitely a very unique concept. I would agree it's southern BBQ with an Asian twist. My co-worker and I flew into Charlotte for a work meeting and stopped by for lunch. We walked out full and happy. We even boxed up the leftovers to continue the feast back at our hotel rooms.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place, so. bad. The menu sounded delicious, and I usually trust a 4 star rating on Yelp. Not so much here. First of all, parking is a mess, skip the lot and try to find street parking. When we arrived we were greeted with a very loud room. Like, be prepared to scream at each other to be heard. The host told us they had a \"really long wait\" but no timeframe. They take your number and are very clear if you don't pick up they move on. I get it, you're getting people in and out, but be a little softer in your approach. (Much like other reviews on here around reservations.) I felt like I was in trouble and I'd been there two minutes. We decided to grab a drink at the bar, nearly impossible inside, so we wandered outside. My margarita was really delicious and my boyfriend opted for a local beer. When we finally got seated (about an hour wait) no one came to serve us. Not until we were making remarks and another waiter heard us, did someone come over. He proceeded to tell us he wasn't our server but he'd figure it out. Finally a girl shows up who doesn't apologize, says she will bring us waters and runs off. We were actually ready to order since we'd sat so long. When she returned, no waters in hand, we ordered and my boyfriend asked for another beer, holding up his can. The next time she comes by, no beer, no water. He asks again. Second time, she brings a jalapeno beer that was not what he was drinking, when she's told it's the wrong one, she asks if he'd rather have that one. Nope. I ordered a beer, she asked if I wanted to sample it, after our food arrives she gives me the sample, so I declined the purchase. We ordered the wings (half and half) the brisket, and the ramen Mac. The ramen Mac was uninspired and tasted like throwing velveeta on spaghetti noodles. The brisket was dry. The wings, were both delicious. So, if I return it will be to grab wings to go. This place lacks service all around, clearly you're doing well so it seems that there's this attitude towards the customer of \"we don't need you, so get over it.\"",

    "text": "What an awesome find in Charlotte! Coming from LA which is a mecca for Korean cuisine outside of Korea itself, it was a very pleasant surprise to find fusion of American barbecue and Korean flavors at Seoul Food.   The (giant) beef rib had a hint of Korean flavors--don't forget the dipping sauce! While both flavors of the wings were good, I did like the soy garlic better. I took them back to the hotel on the first night, and they stayed crispy in spite of the travel.   The tilapia is served whole fish preparation style, I absolutely recommend even if you're squeamish at the sight of the head. There's an Asian glaze on the fish which makes the facial features less distinct, and the flavors are definitely worth the adventure...plus you can't beat the $14 price tag!   The bulgogi taco was also delish...can be a nice appetizer while waiting for your main event. The service was also very good. Gabby helped us the first night and she was great. Simon helped us the second day, andhe was good too. Sara came up and introduced herself to us; I think she may be a co-owner or manager.  This place is definitely a favorite in Charlotte...I do hope they expand all the way to LA! I can't wait to come back!",

I met a friend for dinner and lucky for us there were other yelpers there who had already ordered so we could see some of the goodies they tried...and they shared their sriracha cracklins with us! So nice! Also, probably the highlight of the meal.   I thought we did a good job ordering a variety of stuff but overall I just left underwhelmed.  Here's the run down:  Sriracha Cracklins - Great way to start the meal. Loved them!   Potato Swirl - Pretty good. I liked whatever the coating was on them.  It's definitely an interesting take on a crispy potato.   Half and Half Wings - These were good, but not great. There was a lot of breading. If that's not your thing...skip them.   Crispy Pork Belly - These could have been better - they came out very dry. Not sure if that's normal or we just got a bad batch.   Smashed Potato Salad - No. Just no. It was very runny and I'm still not sure all of what was exactly in it.   Sausage - I forget the name of it but it was the sweeter version of the two options. Not my favorite.   Also, our service was just okay. Our waiter kinda rushed us through ordering and didn't really explain all the menu items. So that was a bit of a letdown. And then when we said we didn't like the food, seemed a bit confused and sent another waitress over?!   Eventually, the manager came over and apologized an asked for our feedback on what we liked and didn't like so that was a very nice touch. He seemed to really want to get our input to make the food better! But by that point I was pretty much over it.   So...Am I glad I gave them a try? Yes. Will I be running back for a second visit? No thanks.",

I previously worked in the restaurant industry, and I know it can be frustrating when people walk in at the last minute when you are about to close.  I actually felt sorry for our waiter, but he had an attitude of us being his first customers of the day.  Excellent service at such a late hour!  The kimchi taco on the left was was definitely vegan. The sriracha cracklings were gluten friendly, and the brisket taco was my cheat dish.  Who says you can't eat a balanced diet after 1:00 a.m. when you are on the road.",

    "text": "lots of good reviews for this place and i can see why. we went on a wednesday night and we still had to wait (even tho it was literally 2 minutes) for a table to vacate to sit.  we ordered the $23 beef rib, the soy garlic wings, and the potato tornado (potato twist? idk what its called here lol) The beef rib was rich, meaty, fall off the bone tender. I enjoyed the dipping sauce, but the meat itself didn't have the DEEP smoky flavor i was looking for. still worth the $23 purchase though. This came with so much meat that i would consider subbing another entree for this. We had to take home a chunk of this. The soy garlic wings were good, nice and crunchy, and the pieces themselves were very large. a 6 piece quantity was enough to share between two and was very filling. the potato tornado on a stick was my favorite! i loved getting this on the streets of asia and was happy to see this here. it was dusted with a chili powder and served with a spicy dipping sauce; it was fried so that the outside was lightly crispy and the inside was thin yet soft. my favorite part of our meal. Looks like if you went at like 4-5pm or something like that all sides are a tiny price. all food came out VERY quick. waitress was prompt and checked up on us often and gave good recommendations on what to order and how much. just like next door at let's meat, the entire staff/host/everyone was very friendly and greeted us as we walked in and out.  i left this place feeling very heavy and fatty (but that's okay!) and so just a little bit here filled me up pretty quick and didn't kill my wallet. definitely worth a spot to visit when visiting NC. Surprised to find this here but i'm glad it exists!",

They did have a lot of breading on them and both sauces were very sweet. I wish they would've had more sauce options. Nonetheless they were delicious. Me and my boyfriend wanted to share 10 but instead we each got 10 which was way too much. We wish the server would've read our order back to us to ensure she got the correct order. We were staying at a hotel so couldn't take our leftovers which was 11 wings. I would go back for the atmosphere and just order something else.",

    "text": "First time here and it was great! Our waitress briefly explained the background of the restaurant, the menu, and warned us that the food comes as its ready (it literally did). I hate an overwhelming menu, so I liked the simplicity of it and the fact that there are only two flavor options for the wings. Both flavors are so good. Who doesn't love garlic or spicy bbq?  Me and my bf ordered wings, collard greens, and the sweet potato birds nest (really good).  Within 5 minutes literally....our greens were at the table. & the other dishes soon followed. EVERYTHING WAS FRESH! The wings were good, double fried so I didn't have to request them to be extra crispy, as I usually request this.  The sweet potato nest is a pretty dope side item, topped with cinnamon and honey. Mmmmm! I did tell the waitress that it'd be cool of they served it with chopsticks.  Anyway, you guys should try !",

    "text": "My first visit to Charlotte and Seoul Food was the best rated place near where I was staying. Came for lunch so wasn't crowded at all and got a table right away. Somewhat industrial/rustic decor with K-pop playing on the TV screens.   My husband looves their beernog - that's correct, it's a stout topped with eggnog. Interesting concept. Also interesting that a lot of their beer selection is actually Hitachino (Japanese), but I'm counting that as a positive because I dig their beers.  Now food, everything is pretty much served family style on a big platter in front of you. The husband tried to convince me that 1/2 of meat is not a lot and we had to order several things. Trust me it's not trivial... We couldn't finish a bunch of stuff at the end.  Kimchi BBQ pork ribs - My favorite of the bunch. Very tender ribs and got a nice spicy kick to it.  Bulgogi sausage - Can't say I could have picked out the bulgogi flavor in a blind tasting but it was good.  Crispy pork belly - The most disappointing part of the meal. The fat was an overwhelming portion of the serving (I say going on 70%) and the skin was difficult to chew on majority of pieces. I ended up just picking off the small pieces of meat and left all the rest to waste.  Broccoli - The healthy part of our meal. It was more or less steamed broccoli with gochujang on top, no idea why my husband was such a big fan.  Potato swirl - This was excellent! It takes art (or a nice machine) to cut the potato this way. Each piece you pull off is very thin but crispy on the outside and I really like whatever seasoning it is they put on it.  Overall, had a good meal and it was certainly a fun concept fusing southern BBQ with Korean flavors. Seeing other reviews, looks like the dishes are really hit or miss. And if you order the \"correct\" or better items will define your experience here.",

My husband liked the pulled pork and the green tea biscuits were a fun dessert. The restaurant was packed and loud but it was a fun dining experience. I would give a 5 star review, except our daughter does not like sauce on her food and has some dietary needs. she asked for plain wings the waitress came back and said the chef refused to make her plain wings because he believed that everyone had to experience the flavors. We ordered 6 wings with mild sweet sauce, our daughter hated it and didn't eat. As a family traveling from out of state that put a damper on the meal. We had to go find food for her, she was hungry after long day. We spent quite a lot on our meal, it seems like allowing a young customer to eat her food how she would like wouldn't be too much trouble. Despite, the wing incident- I will definitely go back to try more of their dishes the next time I'm in Charlotte.",

We then order a beer and it takes over 20 minutes to get to us. No apologies or anything by the server. We then order our food and specifically ask for the wings to be our app and that doesn't happen. Our main meal comes out and everything tastes bland. We had the fire chicken beef ribs wings which were all fatty and bland tasting. We expressed our dissatisfaction with our experience and the waiter ignored us. We will never go back. I will end this with the fact that my husband and I eat out all the time and will always give a place a second chance but not this time. Eat at your own risk.",

Which is very impressive   Crispy pork belly - awesome, very authentic from my own experiences with Chinese style pork belly... To all the reviewers who called it tasteless, they fail to appreciate that pork belly by nature is supposed to be minimally spiced. Some salt and a lot of fat makes for a delicious combo.   Pulled pork - pretty good. I was never a big fan of this as a food category but this place ranks up there with the best  Alcohol menu - out of this world, I would come here just to drink if possible, rather than limit choices to the traditional Asian staples like hite and Sapporo, these guys went out of their way to find truly \"craft\" beer. Big round of applause.   Ramen Mac and cheese - having gotten by college on a staple of korean ramen I would say that although very tasty, this menu item lacks the fiery red powder that we have all come to fear and love of Korean ramen. So while exceeding expectation, Seoul foods interpretation without the spiciness is odd.   Ambiance and decor - very contemporary if you like shake shack you'll love this   Check this place out ... I would highly recommend",

The soy garlic sauce is subtle yet delicious and they are fried to absolute perfection.  Also, they are HUGE!  I don't know what kind of birds these people are using, but I'm all about it.   Unfortunately we only got to try the mac and cheese because they were out of a lot of things, but I would like to come back to get the crispy pork belly and ribs.  I had the watermelon lemonade (with Tito's!) which was pretty incredible.  They have a great selection of local brews, too.   We were quoted an hour wait when we walked in, which was odd because there was only one couple waiting in the lobby area.  My partner and I found a couple seats at the bar within 10 minutes and when I let the hostess know, she said we were next on the list.  Come on girl, you quoted an hour and it was only 10 minutes??  That's alarming because I probably would not have stayed if this wasn't our first visit.  I would suggest a phone/text system so patrons can hang out in the neighborhood if you're expecting hour to hour and half waits.  Nonetheless, I'll most likely be back to get the wings to-go or for a quick bite at the bar.",

My wife and I tried several items off the menu to get a sampling of all they had. Everything we tried, from the wings, short ribs, pork cracklings, pork belly, and kimchi slaw was tasty. Will def be coming back, and look forward to their future expansion.",

Last night we went and ordered the beef ribs....90% of it was just fat...there was barely any actual meat.  We have ordered this before and not had this problem.  The owner tried to sell us on the idea it is a fatty piece of meat and is normal....there is nothing normal about paying $23 for a rack of ribs that have virtually no meat.  This really soured me on the place.",

    "text": "I've eaten KBBQ in big cities, as well as homecooked, so I was nervous upon hearing the word \"fusion.\" But the food here is objectively delicious. The beef ribs have the smoked deliciousness of kalbi and the Korean fried chicken is amazing. The cocktails and local beer selection is on point too which is a huge plus. It's a small restaurant so a wait seems inevitable at peak hours, but our food came out really quickly after ordering (~10 min). The interior is reminiscent of a modern KBBQ place with Kpop music and wood/metal designs, but without the grills in each table. My encouragement to this restaurant would be to keep it up and add a few more popular Korean offerings to the menu in some form - dukkboki / spicy rice cakes and real kimchi as sides, vegetarian bibimbap (this would make the restaurant more veg-friendly - for group outings, it's hard to pick this place if someone in the group doesn't eat meat, they'd be stuck ordering sides) and add bulgogi to the meats.",

    "text": "My husband and I visited on 3/11/16 to kick off my birthday weekend. I had seen some blogs talk about Seoul Food and since I love Korean and Southern food, I knew I had to try it. There were a few kinks, it was hard to find parking near it (but that is to be expected on a Friday night I suppose) and there were several empty tables but we had to wait 20ish mins. Perhaps because they didn't want to overwhelm the servers/waitstaff. However 20 mins on a Friday night is not bad and the food was so worth it.   Our waitress told us to pronounce her name \"Win\" (I'm not sure how to spell it) but she was amazing. She kept our drinks refilled, was very personable, and kept us updated on everything. She was very sweet and made sure every need we had was met without asking.   The food was amazing. We had the crispy pork belly, pulled pork, ramen mac&cheese, potato swirl, kimchi cole slaw and the bao buns. Standouts were the pulled pork, ramen mac, and cole slaw (though I didn't try the buns because my husband devoured them). The pork belly was a tad too crispy and a tad too greasy, so I probably will try a different entree next time. The potato was good, but was a little to spicy for me.   We were pleased with the portion size also. We went to a similar family-style bbq place in Brooklyn and the portions were tiny. However, we left Seoul Food full and with leftovers. I can't wait to come back and try more sides/entrees and I hope that they will include brunch on the weekends soon.",

Despite ours being the only table outside on a chilly night, he checked in with us regularly. We ordered a lot of food, but the pork tacos, kimchi fries, ribs, and sweet potato birds nest all stood out and were all incredible. The sweet potato birds nest would be good to save for last - it would make a great dessert.   Also, the patio area is dog-friendly and well fenced in - if your dog slips its leash, it won't escape out to the street.",

    "text": "Tried out this place today. The menu looked very interesting online, and it did not disappoint. We've tried kimchi sausage as an appetizer. Flavor-wise it was great, and the way it was cased, you could tell it wasn't mass-produces. It was a bit on the dry side though. As the entree, my husband and I ordered beef rib, with the side of collard greens, ramen \"mac'n'cheese\" and sriracha cracklings. Beef rib was super yummy, but a bit too fatty. Which is just a matter of personal preference, I guess. Ramen was the best of both worlds - I might need to start making this at home. Cracklings were also very good, nice balance of crunchy, fatty, spicy, and when they were brought out to us they were still making the crackling sound :)  My favorite part was the dessert. They call it green tea biscuit, but essentially it was two mini-donuts filled with matcha ice-cream. And it was freaking delicious. Might be my new favorite thing to eat. The hot sugary donut and the smooth creamy delicate ice-cream are a winning combo. Had to get seconds and ate on the way home.  Friendly staff, great service. The only other little negative was the music - a bit too loud, could barely hear my husband from across the table.",

Upon recommendation from the manager, my husband ordered the beef rib. The rib had so much fat and no meat that it was completely inedible. The fat wasn't even soft, it was hard and chewy. My husband called the restaurant to tell them and the gentleman who answered the phone said he had to talk to his manager and would call back. He calls back to say that we can come back in for a replacement. After seeing the first rib, no one in their right mind would want a replacement. It was also inconvenient for us to drive back. Lastly, the manager should have called back to correct the situation and at least refund the rib. Ah well, at least we have dinner for our dog.",

Wings: the wings brought this from a 3 star to 4 star restaurant in my opinion. They have a thick, crunchy shell like I've never had anywhere else and the inner meat is tender. Overall flavor is on the tangy side and delicious!  Pork belly: a bit on the fatty side with skin crispy like a pork rind. Tastiest when dipped in accompanying sauce  Short ribs: huge portion - order this to share or if you have a huge appetite. Very juicy with good flavor, although I've had better at other American BBQ joints  Potato swirl: a fun side that reminds you of something you'd get at a fair. The sauce is spicy and tasty  Sweet Potato Birdsnest: we couldn't figure out how to eat this - hard to pick up, broke into a ton of pieces, on the dry side. Not impressed.  Ramen Mac and cheese: novel idea, but not quite a success - difficult to eat (you can't fork ramen) and tasted like Velveeta  Overall, the atmosphere is good and the food is an American spin on Korean and a good spot to go if you're craving meat and carbs and drinks served in pineapples or coconuts.",

I started with the soy garlic chicken wings and they were fantastic. I then went with crispy pork belly rolls and they were also good. They did have some local beers that I enjoyed. The place was packed so you can expect a wait but they did turn them over fairly quickly. Enjoy the videos they play, I'll leave that to your imagination.",

I didnt  the sauce was good but the cubes of tofu just dont feel like wings. Can they b double fried? Can they b shaped? Can they b smaller? Biting into these was like biting into a gusher  it was weird. But luckily the flavors were there. Just texturally these are a miss. I hope they revise their recipe for these in the future. The bao buns are delish. I love bread so these light and chewy buns with a lil sweetness didn't disappoint. The last thing i got was dirty rice. (Pictured)The sauce was good but the rice seemed over cooked. I'd go here again. Aint much left to try but I'd still go lol",

    "text": "Finally got to try this place out! I would go solely for the \"soccer pool\" outside. They also have a gated dog area, beer pong, large connect four, with an outside bar. The outside is just where it's at. The inside is pretty neat also, with rooms to rent by the hour for a private group karaoke. Neat! There's like 4 rooms to rent out, by size. Smallest $30 hour. Largest $100 hour, but it's a big room! So cool.   The food: it's a Korean BBQ place. Food options are interesting. We tried: * sweet potato birds nest - its shavings of sweet potato fried with honey & cinnamon. So good! Hard to eat. But yummy! * bao buns - not that good, I saw some reviews on here saying to get those so I ordered them. But don't! Very weird, not like the buns from futa buta if you've had those - they are a gold mine. *kimchi fries - also delish! Reg French fry with kimchi on top (like a red cabbage) just a little like a sauce on top. Interesting and good but hey I love fries  * crispy pork belly - entree, good amount. Meat itself very soft and juicey but also has a hard tough side that is way too crispy in my opinion.   Drinks: I had the * \"Seoul margarita\" $11 pretty good! I love margs. The rim was interesting, mix of sugar, salt, coffee bean crumbs and ? * \"Seoul fashioned\" $12 my dudes go to drink, he said it was good. Came out looking fancy with a orange slice & cherry. Pretty standard for those. Drinks are kinda pricey. You have choice of which liquor to use, and the price can go up.   Tip: Monday - Thursday \"happy hour\" with $1 sides. Good deal if you can get there! Otherwise all sides are $4.   Service: they don't really do reservations unless you have a party of 6+. They do not use the no wait app. I came here early like 5:30 so got a table pretty quick and was waiting on my date. Waitress came right away and gave me the breakdown. Then she kinda disappeared for a while. I eventually had to flag her down after my date showed and we had been waiting like 5 mins. Other than that, the food came out pretty quickly.",

We ordered half and half which is half spicy  BBQ and soy garlic! Both were sauced well but still crunchy and nice size not skimpy! We also tried the soy pickled deviled eggs - DELISH AND DIFFERENT from my traditional southern style and the potato swirl nothing fancy bout it but really tasty as far as tators go. Lol  they serve the wings with pickled radish which was unexpectedly good since I thought I didn't like radish but pickled is the way to go with that!   The real star  of the show was the FAT BRISKET BULGOGI TACO  talk about flavor - thin sliced marinated beef, some kind of slaw and pickled cukes IT WAS THE BOMB DOT COM lol you must try one - I was also pleased at the size of it since they're $4 each  but worth it for sure!   Bottom line - as their motto says FEED YOUR SEOUL!",

Very unique idea and has a fun atmosphere so I was exited to come here visiting from Boston. Unfortunately was a disappointment in food and taste, especially when I love Korean food!   Basically it Korean food made to order like BBQ. Meats comes on a metal tray with sides.   Kim chi cole slaw was lacking in taste and overly strong with just pepper.  Kim bap was my favorite and closest to the Korean taste. Wings... eh i think Bon Chon chicken taste 90% better.  Ribs ... made the mistake of ordering regular ribs but we wanted the big beef ribs. It tasted OK. Collard greens : I would pass if you are expecting the \"Southern\" taste but it's js tastes like its cooked in broth. Devislish eggs were pretty good. Love the idea of incorporating \"Korean\" touch to it by using aged or soaked eggs. Also got the corn dip with shrimp chips? Don't remember the name but that's as pretty unique and I love it.  Overall I'm glad I tried it.",

The restaurant didn't seem busy. I noticed several people park behind the building then go elsewhere(not fair to paying customers). Ok, my Kanye West rant is over.   Walking in, my friend and I requested a table for two. The hostess said, they were short staffed it would take 15-20 mins, but we could sit at the bar. Welp, to the bar we go Diana!   The bar. I definitely appreciate any business that has purse hooks! Yess!! We were greeted right away. The bartender was VERY Informative, without looking at the menu he covered everything!!! I swear our food couldn't arrive fast enough!  What we ordered: - Drinks: I settled for Lemonade! Which was amazing considering I had a birthday hangover. My friend Ordered a Margarita. Which sneaked up on her later (she has a low tolerance) I'll have to judge for myself later!   - Food: The Kimchi Pork Ribs- were okay. Fire chicken- nice smoke flavor! Comes with shredded cheese on top, really good. 6 wings (3-soy Garlic and 3-Spicy) the spicy wings had too much sauce. The Soy garlic were crispy with great flavorful!! As for sides we ordered the Ramen Mac & Cheese, along with the potato swirl! The Best!!! Needless to say I will definitely be coming back again soon!!",

When I called to make it, I was given a long disclaimer--we don't hold it longer than 15 min, we won't seat you until everyone is here, the person who made the reservation must be present, if you try to come with less people we won't honor the reservation... The day of, I got a super long text reminder of their policies. Fine. I get it. However, if I have to follow your strict guidelines, I should be able to sit at my reservation time or within that 15 minute grace period window.   Reservation was for 6 people at 7:00. Parking was awful. I  was in the first car and was able to park and walk in before 7:10. I let the hostess know I was here and the other car was trying to park. They made it in the door before 7:15. I'm pretty sure they didn't bother to actually hold a table for my reservation. No one else was waiting when we arrived nor did they while we proceeded to wait 40+ minutes to be seated. It was a few minutes to 8:00 when we got a table for a 7:00 reservation. No apologies for the wait. No customer service. It was very disappointing since I had hyped up the restaurant so much.",

There is a slight twist on everything that makes you want to try just about everything .   It is more tapas /family style restaurant so going with a small group is perfect because you can try a lot of different things.   My favorite by far that I tried was the collard greens! Hands down someone threw it down in the kitchen for real with the greens. Literally taste like they stole my mom's recipe and cooked it in the back of the kitchen! FYI my mommy can make some excellent green!  I tried the tofu wings which I was shock at how good they were honestly and I tasted the actual wings which were equally flavorful and delicious.  I was not a big fan of the pimento corn cheese as it was too heavy on the corn side and a weird texture to me.   The atmosphere is casual but classy as the vibe is just very different than any place in the Queen City. This could be due to the K-Pop that was playing in the background on the televisions. Hearing the Korean version of R Kelly is always fun as this guy was playing drums in an random corn field.   Nevertheless, back to the point. Try just about anything and you can't go wrong! Great place and be prepared to wait if you get there too late.",

We came here based on a friend's suggestion and ironically found out we came to the wrong restaurant the next day as he meant for us to try out \"Soul\" not Seoul. Thankfully this restaurant still had amazing food just like the original place he intended for us to go. And the was more than worth the price in my opinion which is always a plus as well. Some of my favorite things on the menu include the kimchi fries, crispy pork belly, and the yuzu jar drink. We came back here again during their happy hour special and it was awesome as well. You can get any of their $5 sides for just $1. We got about 6-7 different things and then got to try their soy garlic wings as well. Only downside is that deal literally only lasts for one hour. Check out this place if you're trying to fill up on some good fusion Korean food!",

Faves: Kimchi fries- so much flavor Pulled Pork- so tender and saucy Baf Wings- double fried? say no more!  They have so many cool local brews. Tried a blueberry combo one that was delicious. They also give you little samples before you get a whole glass which is really nice.  Modern, casual, slghtly hipster vibe. The wait staff is super helpful in describing menu items and really laid back and friendly.  Not sure if this is a tourist destination or a local hot spot but I loved my experience here. Would definitely recommend this!",

We got here right when it first opened, I ordered the BAF wings the medium size 1/2 soy garlic and 1/2 spicy bbq, baked ram n cheese, and sweet potato birds nest..   The ram n cheese came out first which was super good at first when you first bite into it you get like an interesting flavor because of the ramen but you quickly realize how good it is and is almost in comparison to southern baked Mac and cheese similar to what you'd get at your family Thanksgiving.. next up was the wings which are HUGE wings.. I personally prefer the soy garlic over the spicy bbq. The bbq isnt that spicy and was all over the wings.. wings are definitely oversized cause of the breading but the crunch and crispiness is good.. next was the sweet potato birds nest is interesting cause there is no real way to eat it.. also the sweet potatoes came out much more crispy than expected and were cold and borderline burnt. Other than that I wasn't too much of a fan..   Overall decent experience though.",

I didn't enjoy any of it and neither did my spouse. The chicken is coated in shredded cheeses (cheddar and mozzarella) and is honestly not palatable in my opinion. The cheese was overwhelming so I picked most of it off but then the chicken thigh was dry. It takes a lot to dry out chicken thighs. We left more than a third of the split small portion behind. We didn't finish the wings either. They were over-fried and just unenjoyable. I've heard great things about Seoul Meat Co. so it was a serious disappointment that we had this experience.",

    "text": "It's been several months since I last visited this restaurant, so I decided to try it again...this time with a Korean friend who was interested in checking this out for the first time. For a rainy Sunday, it was surprisingly bustling...but not quite packed. This was the first time I went for lunch, and it looked and felt even more casual than I had last remembered...possibly because of the brighter lighting? Anyway, the menu seemed about the same, so we both ordered several items each (since many items included affordable \"Sides\"). Well, right off the bat, I noticed that the \"KimBap\" was a tad different. Tasted good, but it had less veggies and was primarily just Bulgogi this time. Also, the \"Pimento Corn Cheese\" with Chips tasted different...also worse than before. I also tried some new items, like the Fish Taco, which was OK...and \"Choiang Broccoli\", which was good, but a tad too spicy. From our batch of orders, the best item was the \"Potato Swirl\" that my friend ordered (and shared). I've had that before in the past as well, but at least it looked and tasted the same...still as good as it was before. BTW, my friend didn't seem overly impressed with any of her choice items, though she did like some of it. Another something different that I noticed was the lack of trays this time around. All the food items, which came in super-casual paperware, were delivered by hand...not on this casual silver tray. I know this shouldn't be a big deal, but it was a let-down anyway... since it was part of this eccentric, family-style presentation of the whole thing? Just as I might have mentioned in my previous review, there seems to be a lack of consistency with this restaurant...whether in the quality, the delivery, or the presentation of the foods. The service is also inconsistent. Our waitress did a fine job today, but on my previous visit, the waitress basically botched up our order...because she failed to check with the kitchen staff on our foods (they completely forgot 2 of the items that we ordered). Guess the point is...the experience here was quite disappointing (again). I do appreciate the unique varieties of foods here, and some are good...BUT...there is a lot of room for improvement in terms of quality, consistency, even general presentation. The casual paper plates thing has worn off on me already (as being \"trendy\"), and has begun to look really cheap. Maybe they can upgrade their paperware to plates in the future? If not, maybe go back to better presentation of foods with proper trays (no matter how cheap or casual)?? On a positive note, I thought their pricing was generous on the most part. In fact, you can try a variety of foods at a good value...thanks to many friendly $4 \"Sides\". Truly, it's not all bad. In addition to reasonable pricing, you'll find unique, interesting combination of foods (after all, it's quite the unusual Southern American/Korean fusion food!).   In short, definitely worth trying out, but again, things can get dicey here, so just keep your fingers crossed!  PS**Sorry about the Monster-Long review, but had to vent on a few things lol!",

I greatly appreciate that, however we were stuck at a small high top take with really uncomfortable bar stools with no backs on them and mine kept wobbling the whole time. Which is one of my biggest pet peeves with chairs. It was also tucked away in a corner beside the bar right where the servers placed all the orders. So the foot traffic was very high beside us. That being said, the food was phenomenal. We are definitely going to come back because we did not get to try all that we wanted to. And we tried like 6 things to begin with! The portions are family style and great for sharing with someone and sometimes still have leftovers. They're goal for food is southern food meets Korean food (hence the name Seoul Food) and it was achieved perfectly.",

From playing games on the back patio (like soccer billiards, connect 4, and beer pong) to watching puppies run in the dog pen to karaoke, it's easy to stay entertained here.   You can sit inside or outside -- both on the back patio and front patio -- but it does get super crowded during peak times.   Drinks: on a nice day I like to come here and grab a beer but if I'm looking to get accidentally drunk the fruit bowls are fun -- your liquor drink comes in a shareable pineapple or watermelon and you laden out your portion into small shot glasses; so fun!  Snacks: the Potato Swirl; Ramen Mac & Cheese.   Food: WINGGSSSSS. Do it. They're extra crispy, which is how I like them. I am a super fan of the soy garlic wings, but when I'm with my friends they make me get the half and half with Korean bbq sauce. I also really like the meat platters, like crispy pork belly, which can feed a few people -- I order a side of bao buns and make my own sandwiches, since the meat literally comes out on a platter with nothing else unless you order stuff with it.",

Atmosphere is very cool, servers and bartenders are nice (they patiently explain the different types of Soju, or Korean liquor), the patio areas (plural) are cool, and I can't wait to check out the private karaoke lounges!

What was worse was the fact that in hearing distance from us he had the nerve tell the waitress we were trying to take advantage... It was a valid question and really we didn't mind to pay but the unprofessional demeanor and his accusatory tone set us off.

I have a thing for Korean kochujang sauce and really liked both the spicy BBQ wings and the fire chicken, and the pimento corn cheese (served with those puffy shrimp crackers) was outrageously good. The small order of fire chicken was enormous and I highly recommend.   Minuses: it's loud in there, and our spendy cocktail was so stingy it seemed like they had made one and then split it into two glasses (we had to go for a backup cocktail at Davidson St. Public House afterwards to make it up to ourselves). The sweet potato birds nest did not sit right as an appetizer, it was way too sweet. But I figure those are just the breaks of finding your way around a menu at a new place. Would eat again!",

Korean fusion helps the cause. The downside to this place is that the food is expensive for what little you get in portion, service, and establishment.

This is when I started to get aggravated. People were running around like chickens with their heads cut off and our table was completely ignored for over 15 minutes while we just sat there and waited. The funny thing was it seemed like no one was really working that hard to help the actual people seated. Everyone seemed to be disorganized and looking around the restaurant, I wasn't the only one who looked annoyed by the way things were going. We decided to cut our losses and leave and go somewhere else. Based on the bad experience, I will not be returning ever again.

So if you just go for the meats & are not concerned with sides (the menu is a la carte) then you might love this place but for me the sides are equally important.

It's a family style food joint and small portions are more than enough for 4.  The restaurants interior is rustic looking and pretty cool (5/5). Service was great (5/5) and he helped us with ordering.   We ordered quite a bit: Kim bop with  bulgogi that was a favorite (5/5); kimchee fries were very good (5/5); sirracha crackling were decent (4/5); kimchee pork spare ribs, I was disappointed with these, they looked odd and the flavor just wasn't good (1/5); sweet potato birds nest was thin sliced and deep fried with honey and cinnamon (4/5); kimchee pork tacos (5/5); bulgogi taco (5/5); fried pork belly drew mixed reviews and were so so imo (3/5).   Next time we'll stick with the bulgogi Kim bop and Kimchee fries and tacos.   Also owner is opening a traditional Korean food restaurant next door so will try that when it opens.",

    "text": "Interesting concept. Not totally southern, and not totally Korean. A fun and eclectic mix of tastiness. On a nice day, OUTSIDE is the place to be. There is a cool, relaxed vibe, like you're at a friend's backyard barbecue. There's cornhole, big Jenga, and even 2 soccerpool courts. They also have an area for your dog to play.   We had Kim Bap (a fully cooked sushi-style roll), spare ribs, ram 'n cheese (mac 'n cheese made with ramen noodles), and kim chee slaw. We discovered that putting some slaw with the rib meat was super yummy. Ram 'n cheese was so-so. The cheese was just poured over the noodles, not actually baked. The Bibimbap Kim Bap was my favorite. So flavorful and pretty. Oh, and we had soju. Soju is a Korean distilled beverage. It came in a cocktail shaker and must have had dry ice inside because fog was rolling out of the top. So fun.",

We ordered the deviled eggs, potato salad, and Ramen Mac with wings. The soy garlic wings were good. The BBQ wings were not and after trying 1 wing we decided they weren't good and since we wouldn't be eating the other 8 could we get more garlic or get them taken off. Again, Dave was amazing and spoke to the manager on our behalf. However the manager would not refund us or give us the wings that we preferred. He was very rude. At other restaurants, I don't think they make you eat or pay for food you don't find satisfactory. I would give this place a 2 star but we had a great waiter and the butter beer was amazing.",

The wings were great - fluffy and crispy breading with tender chicken inside.  Atmosphere-wise it's quite loud inside. They have a patio with a few picnic tables that seems like a better option.   The only reason I can see this place as being successful is because of the neighborhood it's in. It's Trendy.",

It came with spicy mayo on the side if your taste calls for dipping sauce.   I tried a cocktail this trip, a Lychee-Tini with my choice of Tito's vodka. I enjoyed the balance of flavor. You could taste the alcohol, but not an overbearing taste, and the lychee added some delicate sweetness.  Our server, Dylan, was absolutely wonderful. If you haven't been here yet- make some plans.",

    "text": "Seoul Food Meat Company fills an interesting niche in the Charlotte restaurant scene.    The menu is relatively simple - but, oh so great!  You have a selection of about 7 different types of meat - available in small (1/2 pound) and large (1 pound).  I really like the pork spare ribs and the beef rib (only available in large).  I found the crispy pork belly to be a bit fatty for my taste - but, hey, it's pork belly so it's hard to complain about it.    Then, you have a selection of maybe 10 sides.  I love the brocolli salad and the crackling pork skins - but, I've tried almost all of the sides and haven't been disappointed.   Now, what i really love is the chicken wings.  They are so darn tasty and addictive.  Available in soy ginger or spicy bbq - I like them both, but the soy ginger leads in the race.    I usually go with my parnter - between the 2 of us, we choose one small meat, 10 piece wings and 2 sides.  This gives us plenty of food and a few leftovers.  This is not a quiet place - prepare for it to be loud if you're sitting inside.  Weather-permitting, I always prefer to sit outside.  This has become our go-to restaurant when friends/family are in from out of town - it consistently shines!",

    "text": "Oh Seoul, you know the way to my heart with your Korean flavors and innovated dishes. It all started with a coworker bringing some of your wings into our office and I was hooked.   Came hear for happy hour and some bites to eat. The environment is cool. It's a clean industrial wood look, with music videos playing on several flatscreens.   Our server was great and answered all of our questions. The food is served family style and comes out on the same tray. And some items may come out faster than others. Think Korean tapas style. The menu has a lot of unique items so be sure to ask questions. They also have a variety of adult beverages and local brews on tap.   I ordered a bulgogi taco, chee chili ramen and collard greens. The bulgogi taco was my favorite. It was messy, but massive and packed a punch of flavor. The bulgogi was sweet and delicious. It had crunch and spice. It took me back to when I had the best bulgogi of my life at a food truck on the North Shore of Hawaii. The greens were spicy and had plenty of pork belly. The chili was interesting. It was a little spicy, but reminded me of a chili Mac. On the bottom was their take on Mac and cheese using ramen instead of macaroni. Service was on point. They were great at keeping our table clean and our cups full.   We eventually moved out to the patio. On the way we saw the private karaoke rooms which you can rent by the hour. I love karaoke! On the patio, there's a bar and tons of games: giant jenga, cornhole, and oversized pool game.  I haven't laughed so hard in a long time while playing pool. It's pool, but with soccer balls and is harder than it looks.   We're already planning to come back to eat and karaoke. If you like good drinks, food and fun, you have to check Seoul Meat Company out!",

We waited about 15 minutes for a server to even show up because no one was even assigned to our table, had to track down another server and she said she would find someone. But then another 15 minutes went by and we had to go to the front desk to let them know we hadn't gotten a server yet and they were very nice about it and found someone. The wings are great, very fresh, very crispy, but I feel like the wings could be served with some pickled radish or kimchi as like a fresh bite. We tried asking for some kimchi, but they don't serve it as a side? Seems weird for a korean place not to serve kimchi. Gimbap is okay, nothing special, but the serving size seems crazy small for the price. In Atlanta most places give you like 10-12 pieces for the same price and have way more filling.",

    "text": "Wow. I dig pretty much everything about this place!  On Saturday afternoon, around 1:30, I was meeting a first date. I was really shocked at how busy they were! However, this was a sign of how amazing this place is. The ambiance, the decor, the building - all very open & \"warm\" feeling. I love the idea of the outdoor bar area (covered, I'm thinking, just for the winter). I absolutely freaked when I saw the dog area! I'm already thinking about taking my dog Cooper there in the spring & summer!  My date & I got the meat sampler platter - which, you guessed it, was all meat. It was a limited time special. We also ordered the sweet potato bird's nest. I ordered the grapefruit sparkler cocktail & my date ordered a couple of cocktails - Buzz City & one other (can't recall the name).  We didn't wait too long for this massive pan to arrive. The presentation was nice & we had many sauces to choose from. There was pulled pork, pork belly, ribs, brisket, fire chicken & one other type of meat. My favorite was the pulled pork & pork belly.  Our bartender was fantastic! Super friendly, attentive & knowledgeable.   While I scored a nice parking spot by the restaurant, I can imagine parking is an issue - especially now, since they have another restaurant opening next door.  Prices are reasonable.",

The best in my opinion was the Mac n cheese, greens, kimchi fries, dirty rice was so bomb, and the cracklings were good. Nothing was bad. Everything was very very tasty. I highly recommend this joint. Oh and we also got the chicken wings which were not on happy hour but so worth the price.",

It heavily lacked flavor and needed additional seasonings. The concept, however, was very creative and nice. I would definitely come back.",

Cooked to perfection with a crunchy exterior 2. The soy garlic wings: I'm not kidding, the best wings I've ever had. And I LOVE and eat ALOT of wings. Crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside, and perfectly sauced 3. Ramen mac: How have I never tried this before? It's so simple but so genius. Imagine if Ramen and Mac n Cheese had a baby. Cheesy heaven 4. Beef ribs: Falling off the bone tender. Super flavorful! 6. Hitachino Nest Hefeweizen: Special shoutout to this beer! Perfect drink pair with a plate of meat.

They had a new extremely spicy sauce, which even the spicy fanatics found really spicy. The wings are korean fried chicken draped with fantastic  fantastic. Have to get this when you're here.  Kimchi Fries: Dang. Wonderful. I love kimchi fries and these were up to par with other places I've had. Won't regret this pick.  Sweet Potato Bird's Nest: There's a lot of sweet potato fries all tangled up in this. Literally a birds nest. The flavors of cinnamon and sweet potato is one of my favorites. If it's one of your favorites too, I'd recommend.  Pimento Corn Cheese: The pimento itself was very good. I typically don't like the chips they serve the cheese with, but it doesn't take away from the pimento.  We enjoyed all of the meats as well, except the tilapia because we didn't order it.",

It ends up being a lot cheaper and you get to try a lot of the food.  The outside area has a pool table looking field on the ground but you play with soccer balls, giant jenga, dog park, and few other games! There are karaoke rooms that you can reserve if you'd like as well.   Great atmosphere paired with really tasty food! Some of the best wings and wing sauce I've ever had in my life! The cheese melted on the ramen Mac and cheese is very tasty and the flavor of the ramen tied with it is soooo good. The pimento corn cheese is a cold slightly sweet, slightly salty creamy dip that goes nicely with the light and airy shrimp chips. The potato swirl has a light cheese seasoning dusted on it that you dip into a creamy chipotle sauce. The kimchi was very flavorful on top of the lightly seasoned fries, but the distribution of the kimchi and beef could have been better. There was too much kimchi in the bites from the top and the fries on the bottom were very dry because there were no toppings at the bottom.",

Our server took great care of us and suggested great food as well because it was our first time.   Being Korean myself, it is not very Korean inspired as impersonated. Yes, there is pickled diakon (which is not very good) and kimchi, but nothing really authentic. If you're looking for anything Korean, try again. If you're looking for some good food, give it a try!",

Their fruit punch beer is super refreshing and since I'm a creature of habit, this is usually what I get here. I've tried a few of their mixed drinks and soju concoctions when friends got it and they were delicious, except for their fruit punch mixed drink but ya know, to each his own and all that.   Aside from their drinks, their food is dooope. You really can't go wrong with their kimchi pork tacos, fire chicken, wings, or green tea sugar biscuits.   They even have a dog park and games outside so bring your fur babies, play some games, and enjoy their food and drinks.",

This is Korean food with a Southern twist.  You just gotta try it out.  They have indoor and outdoor seating with a fence so your dog can with with you outside on those hot days and cool nights.  There are tvs around the restaurant and there could be sports on, or some fun Korean Music videos to watch.  Either way, the vibe is always poppin.  The food, my. Goodness.  What really brings me back are the wings.  They are fun and different with the crunchy texture it has packed with such great flavor. I also like the Pimento Corn Cheese.  When I have my cheese cravings, I like to order those.  The pimento cheese comes on top of shrimp chips, trust me, just order them.  This part is pretty random to state, but kudos on their bathroom.  Even when you go in, you still get a cool hip vibe in there just as in the dining room.  Every time I go in, it's always so clean so the staff is great with keeping that up.",

I also ordered two flavors of wings. It took 3 attempts to bring me the half and half I ordered, no big deal, the waiter was nice and kept trying until he got it right. Probably just personal preference, but the breading was too thick for my taste, and the BBQ sauce didn't do it for me. The soy flavor was better, but those 3 wings will be my last ones. Although the place had a cool vibe, nice outdoor back bar, and a unique play yard for adults (plus a dog park), it's not really someplace I'd go back to.",

    "text": "This place was incredible! I'm so glad to have something like this in Charlotte--it's bringing ethnicity, diversity, and fun to the city.   We ordered pork belly (with buns), kimbap (korean sushi), both types of wings, and the ram 'n mac (mac and cheese made with ramen noodles).   The wings were beautifully seasoned, and the spicy wings have a kim-chi-like sauce on them. They are mildly spicy. We really enjoyed the kim bap quite a bit--it was a new item on the menu, but there were several meat filing options to choose from. All very flavorful and tasty. The pork belly was EXTRA crispy. This was my only complaint because it was hard to taste the meaty part of it. Ram 'n mac was a fun, quirky twist on mac and cheese. There were pork rinds on top to make for some good texture.   The atmosphere of Seoul Food is casual, but fun. Food is served on trays and in cardboard servers. Everything is messy in the best way. Price-wise, my husband and I were able to eat for $22 total and we had PLENTY of food.   We also had a chance to speak to the owner, who showed us around the restaurant and all of the new karaoke rooms they have! They are beautifully themed/decorated. Their outdoor space is spacious, you can bring your dog, and they have jumbo-sized pool/billiards that you play with soccer balls! The owner told us that eventually they will be making an all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ section.   We had a great time and look forward to going back. Such a great fusion of authentic Korean food and southern flavors.",

The kimbap and the spring rolls were awesome, the fire chicken was tender and juicy, the pimento cheese was a little bland, and the bao buns were literally just buns.

We rock paper scissored our way to the bulgogi kimbab, baby back ribs, Kimchi fries, and pork belly spring roll! I was in hog heaven (literally)!

Honorable mentions are the ramen Mac n cheese and the fire chicken. If you're feeling adventurous, try the soju. It's really refreshing. The back patio is so fun for a group at night. You can have food ordered out their or get drinks at their bar and play pool soccer, beer pong, or a few other games. Dogs welcome on the back patio. There's a fenced in area for them :)",

He asked us if we wanted to order shots at least 4-5 times and in a very frat boy obnoxious way. Other then that, the crispy pork belly was delicious, kimchi fries were delicious I would've liked more kimchi though, kimchi sausage taste was great but the texture was funky, don't know if it just needs more binder or what, ramen mac and cheese I wouldn't order again, bao buns were nice and soft and really good with the cucumber salad and pork belly with sauce.  I look forward to trying more things and more beverages when the time is right, I'm super curious about soju.",

I got the fire chicken, the flavor was a little bland and there was nothing spicy about it. Tried the pork belly and it was incredibly dry. The pork rinds were you know- pork rinds, nothing special there. The pimento cheese was just ok but the chips or whatever those things are that come with it has zero taste.   All and all nothing was bad it's just not memorable but the place is pretty cool. A lot of people like it so if you're wondering about it I would at least give it a try.",

The wings are good but the soy garlic flavor wasn't as good for me. In my opinion the tacos are about a dollar overpriced for what you're getting but the braised beef had a great taste.  The staff seemed upbeat and super friendly and the atmosphere is obviously modern and casual. I am not from Charlotte so the location to me seemed sketchy and parking was a hassle.  Some issues for me were that the white radishes that came with the wings were tasteless and the ribs had only one minuscule side of pickled cucumber.  Also, seating is a bit small.  Other than that, this is a good place to get some fusion food and definitely a place I'll go to again.",

When he finally could be bothered to take your order it would be 3-7 minutes for a draft beer. And he took everyone's credit cards to close out- then proceeded to take 3 parties food orders and hold our cards the whole time. 15+ minutes for 1 beer and to be treated like an inconvenience is really unacceptable.

The rest of the food is great, but their wings are very unique. They only have two flavors, which I think they should definitely get creative and come up with at least two more, but the flavors they do have are fantastic! I like the soy garlic better because it's got a good balance. Sweet, salty, and a very small amount of heat. What makes their wings perfect is the way they prepare them. I'm not sure if they're breaded or if it's just the way the oil congeals when it's cooked with the chicken but wow, are they awesome!  I had the opportunity to try their other food items like the Fire Chicken, which wasn't very \"fiery\" to me at all in terms of heat, but it did have a little kick. It's pretty much chicken breasts, topped with some type of chili paste, and melted cheeses. I really enjoyed it. Their beef brisket and ribs are awesome too.   I didn't have the opportunity to try many sides, but I did enjoy their ramen chili. It didn't have much ramen noodles in it, but the little bit it did have rounded the side dish out pretty good.  The only things I think they can improve on is expanding their wing flavors like I mentioned, and figuring out how to get more seating because it appears that they can get a little crammed when it's busy. Other than that, I will definitely be returning!",

    "text": "Conflicted in this review. Went there yesterday, on a Sunday evening. First impression was more confused than anything else. Had a tent set up with some outdoor games, TONS of people (almost all twenty somethings). Everyone was having a great time. Went inside, was solo and the only option given to me was to sit at the bar, which was completely packed. So I manage to squeeze myself in. Two people working the bar, had to wait about 5 minutes to see a menu, another 5 to order. Ordered the small order of brisket as well as the sriracha cracklings. Waited about 10 minutes for the cracklings, another 10 for the brisket.   The good? The food was delicious. The cracklings were fresh, seasoned pretty good, nice and spicy. The brisket was delicious, cooked pretty well (although little to no smoke ring) and came partially sauced with more sauce on the side, as well as a little bit of Korean pickles I believe.   The bad? I was sick all night. I am the last person to ever blame being ill on a specific meal or restaurant. However, this was the only thing I ate that day, I felt great before hand, and the problems I had when I got back to my hotel were gastrointestinal and in more than one way.   Would I give them a second try if I found myself in the area? Maybe. I like the concept, I love their take on Korean food, and the food tasted good. However, the prices were a bit high, and I probably would have passed if I had known beforehand that the atmosphere was more frat house party than dining establishment. Also the part where I made 12 trips to the bathroom afterwards. If you're looking to party and get some food to soak up the booze, this is the place. If you are just looking to get some food, keep this in mind.",

    "text": "This is easily some of the best food I have had in my entire life! And I have had a lot of food...  We came on a Saturday evening and were seated immediately. This is not a testament to their popularity, we just happened to hit the \"sweet spot\" for getting a seat. Within 15 minutes, the place was packed!  We ordered the Crispy Pork Belly and the Fire Chicken for our meats. For our sides, we chose the Soy Pickled Deviled Eggs, Chili Ramen, and Bao Buns.   I'll start with the meat: The Crispy Pork Belly was prepared perfectly. Crispy on the edges and soft on the inside. It was like eating bacon on steroids, and I can not think about it without my mouth watering. As for the Fire Chicken: I have never had chicken that tastes this good! The chicken had a spicy and smoky flavor and was perfectly moist. Plus, it was smothered in cheese!  The sides were also good, but not the stars of the show. The Bao Buns were nice and fluffy and served plain to use as a catalyst for eating the meat. The chili that was served atop the Ramen had a good flavor, but I would probably try another side the next time we dine here. However, the Soy Pickled Deviled Eggs were delicious! I will never pickle my eggs in vinegar again. Soy it is!  And last, but not least, let me tell you about the alcohol: we ordered the Apple Soju which is served in a shaker with 2 small glasses. As with Saki, you pour for the other person, never for yourself. Slightly carbonated, drinking the Soju was like drinking apple soda. Fantastic!   For those who like to stick to beer, I would recommend the Blueberry Lager. It is served with fresh blueberries and tastes like blueberry soda. They seem to have a knack for serving alcohol that doesn't taste like alcohol... dangerous...  In closing: Go here! Eat, drink, and be merry!",

I highly suggest that you avoid this place if you have a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, dry eyes, dry mouth or if you're a super taster! I have never had so much salt in my life!  The problem with the menu here is that there is no balance whatsoever. Everything you order is a super flavor salt bomb and you find yourself with nothing to tame it or balance it. You will drink a TON of water, so get ready. I suggest you order a plain white rice upfront to eat with any of the other dishes to try to balance out the flavors in your mouth. This place is really doing way too much. I would not recommend to anyone.   We ordered soy ginger wings, brisket tacos, kimchi fries, soy pickled deviled eggs, spring rolls and green tea ice cream. The ONLY thing I would recommend is the green tea ice cream with sugar biscuits.   I would never return to this place.",

You've gotta get the chicken wings and the fried tofu--no vegans here, but the tofu is seriously as good as the wings. Also, get the beef ribs.   The sriracha cracklins and potato swirl are our favorite side items. If you wanna feel healthy with all your meat, get the tomatoes, too. They are marinated in soy sauce and are a nice light complement to the meats.   To drink: the coconut soju is the best. And the date tea, if you are keeping it nonalcoholic!   -Scallionpancake",

    "text": "My fiance and I were really looking forward to dining at Seoul Food based on the reviews on Yelp. Plus, we love good Korean food and BBQ. We didn't think Seoul Food lived up to its Yelp hype.   We arrived at 6:45 on a Friday and had an hour wait, which was expected!  We walked over to Unknown Brewery and had a beer while we waiting for our table.  Upon being seated, we each decided to get a cocktail since the drink reviews were so stellar on Yelp.  I ordered an old fashioned and my significant other ordered a martini.  When she set down my old fashioned and the liquid was completely clear, I knew it wasn't going to be good.  There was maybe a splash of bourbon, and the rest was water.  Really not good.  My significant other's martini sucked too. Same issue -- it was completely watered down.  Have no idea how it's even possible to water down a martini.  Anyway, our food came out quick, which we both appreciated.  We ordered 6 wings (half and half with soy garlic and spicy BBQ), pork belly, ribs, sriracha cracklings, bao buns and collard greens.  Here's my rundown on the food:  Wings:  The wings were amazing-- probably the best wings I've ever had.  They are really big and crunchy, and they have awesome flavor. Especially the soy garlic wings, and I generally prefer spicy! 5 stars.  Pork Belly:  The pork belly came to our table cold and without flavor.  This could be really good if they found a better way to flavor it.  I know that there is BBQ sauce, but pork belly is too delicious to have to smother it in BBQ sauce! 2 stars.  Ribs:  I really liked these, my SO wasn't as thrilled. The ribs came out cold too.  I thought that the ribs were seasoned well but slightly overcooked. 3 stars.  Sriracha cracklings: it's hard to mess these up.  They were good, but nothing special.  4 stars.  Collard Greens: These came out cold as well, and they didn't have any flavor.  2 stars.  I'll probably be back here, as a lot of my friends like the atmosphere and the food.  But when I come back, I am going to stick to the wings and beer!",

We did not like that response and wondering what type of beer we were drinking.   The atmosphere is lovely with exposed brick walls and warm lighting. We also liked how they played Korean Pop music on TV which you don't see very often. lol  We would definitely come back and just a heads up you don't need the large size for two people.

I loved the market price beef rib it was tender Smokey and as meaty as you could desire. The Bulgogi is one of my favorites thanks to SFMC I was introduced to this Korean gem. The wings are to die for both flavors I order the wings every time I go no matter what I did have one instance where I had a little to much feathers on a batch I picked up to go but I still didn't put SFMC at the back of the line because wings will slip up no matter where you go! I also tried the pimento corn dip, soy deviled eggs,  ramen mac and the kimchi fries I was pleased however you have to eat the kimchi fries fast not so yummy cold just my taste however I literally eat kimchi cold at home. Basically if you are looking for good food and a genius hipster eatery with Korean favorites then this is a awesome spot to try! They also have good drinks and outside games.",

Definitely can't go wrong ordering them. The pulled pork taco was too greasy for me to eat. Ramen Mac & Cheese was okay but I wouldn't order it again. The soy pickled deviled eggs where different, if you like deviled eggs get them for the table and give them a try. Sriracha Cracklins are good, how could you go wrong with sriracha fried pork skins but be ready to share because it's a high order. All of The Meats are tasty and a nice serving. All and all the food is reasonably priced so trying a little of everything especially with a group is always fun.",

The place was pretty packed, both inside and outside, with beerpong raging on the patio. That's a winner in my book. After we were seated, we started off with some Korean Donkeys (Moscow Mules). Service was really slow. After bringing us waters, our waitress never came back. We're talking 10 minutes plus. We ended up tracking down another waitress who became our new waitress. That's a star off for that. Our new waitress did her best to make up for it by being friendly.  The food, however, was incredible. They are served tapas style and we had quite the feast. Soy garlic wings (5/5): Korean Fried Chicken done right. Perfectly crisp and flavorful in a tasty sauce. Fatty brisket beef bulgogi taco (4/5): loved the flavor fo the bulgogi and the aioli but it's made to order so you can't change your order. I wanted to take off the cabbage slaw but had to resort to scraping it off myself. Come on, y'all. Pimeno cheese corn (3.5/5): the creativity is what makes this a cool dish. Take pimento cheese, use it as a base for a corn dip, and add shrimp chips that serve as scoopers. I've never seen anything like it. Potato wheel (3/5): I've had this dish in Shanghai so was pumped to have it again. It was better in Shanghai, though. Take a long stick, add circular fried potatoes to it, add some seasoning, and a dipping sauce. I just wasn't a big fan of the seasoning or the sauce.",

We got there and my parents were already there, this place have an outdoor patio and is pet friendly, we love that because we love to take our puppy  everywhere, we got a table outside,we ordered drinks, I got the pineapple  soju served in a pineapple , my sister got a martini  and my mom got plum wine , we where a little confuse with the menu so we order little by little (sorry to the server, shout out to the server he was amazing, great costumer service)  first we order the crispy pork belly with 3 orders of bao buns and the kimchi slaw, my sister order the swirl potato fried which was seasoned with a delicious Cajun seasoning, I got the ram & cheese  with was good and my mom got the sweet potato  bird nest, it was very good but I will go a lil low on the cinnamon. Then my brother order the ribs the big one and they were AMAZING !!! The meat was so tender and flavorful, we loved it. We got them with more bao buns and kimchi slaw can't go wrong with those, oh my sister got the Korean salad and my mom order the pimento corn cheese  or something like that, that was the last thing we ordered. The bill came to almost $200 which it was ok for all that we ate and drink , we think it was a fair price for all the food we got, compare to other restaurants !  It was a great experience ! We will definitely comeback!   I can't post more pictures because we were too busy eating to take pictures hahaha",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of southern BBQ, Korean BBQ, and chicken wings. After a 4+ star rating on Yelp, I thought it would be a perfect spot to go to while in Charlotte for the night.  I hopped in an Uber and went to the Southend of Uptown.  The area is really hip and the restaurant is very well done aesthetically.  We were greeted at the door and hustled outside to a wooden picnic table.  The menu is fairly unclear to the average eye, but surely the waiter would be of help, right?  He was friendly, but didn't really have any good suggestions of the crowd favorites.   We ordered cocktails and wine along with an order of the Deviled Eggs and Spicy BBQ wings that came out promptly, but before drinks and even water.  There were a shortage of setups and no napkins for the very messy wings.  The wings were of the breaded variety and were actually pretty good, but just too saucy.    We then ordered a series of items: Fire chicken, pork ribs, bulgogi sausage, ramen mac, sweet potato, and the spiral potato.  The fire chicken was decent, covered in cheese and hot sauce. The pork ribs on the other hand looked like something I dissected in high school biology class.  They needed to have a lot more mix of Southern BBQ with a few minutes on the grill to make for a much more appetizing look and taste.  They were literally inedible.  The sausage looked like a gray mush wrapped in pig intestines.  It was cold and if it was smoked, it might have been slow cooked for 35 seconds.  The Ramen Mac was a soup of cheese and noodles with mediocre flavor.  The potato dishes were average at best.   Overall Seoul Meat Company was a complete disappointment and I'm shocked that there were so many good reviews.  This supposed fusion of southern BBQ and Korean BBQ needs to have a revamp of both sides of the equation.   The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the wings were pretty good.  The other food pulled the score way down.",

This place is family style so I would recommend going with family or good friends that you can share the larger portions with. It is also not a Korean bbq it is a Korean BBQ fusion so expect some different flavors. Also a lot of the food has a little spice to it so if you can not take any heat I would not recommend it to you. Big fan of the chicken wings and the fire chicken, and enjoyed most of the other dishes also. It is a bit pricey and was very crowded when I went and had a lot of trouble finding parking. Seems this area is becoming really trendy so Seoul fits right in.",

    "text": "First time trying Seoul Food Meat Company due to the high reviews on Yelp. The service was prompt and the waitress was extremely patient with first time customers and willing to give suggestions and opinions on menu items. One great suggestion was the mimosa bar which I absolutely loved. We opted for an entire bottle of champagne for $20 which was a great value considering the price of just one glass. The bar was well stocked, clean and easy to use.   Food wise The restaurant became mediocre and inconsistent. The pulled pork was absolutely delicious, a rich smokey flavor and tender meat. I paired it with the bao buns which allowed me to make my own mini pulled pork sandwiches. The sauce for the pork is definitely not your typical southern vinegar based sauce but a slightly spicy and smokey tomato based recipe, totally delicious and unexpected.   The pork tacos were good but uninspired. The portions were well worth the cost. We ordered two but upon receiving them realized one would have been sufficient. They consisted of pulled pork, Asian slaw, a tangy sauce topped with brined cucumbers all sitting on a flat bread type base. While they weren't bad there was nothing to warrant going to Seoul Food Market just for them. They could have been pork tacos at any restaurant.   We ordered the pimento corn cheese which gets an A+ for presentation. Served on a metal tray piled on a heaping serving of shrimp chips (chips with shrimp flavored seasoning). The pimento cheese was a bland generic concoction. While the addition of the shrimp chips was unique the dish as a whole was disappointing.   The final thing ordered was the ramen mac and cheese. This item came highly recommended on yelp. Upon trying it I was disappointed but this item more than anything else. While upending the traditional mac and cheese format was intriguing the dish fell flat. The cheese sauce poured over the ramen noodles was reminiscent of craft macaroni and cheese. I was surprised but this given the high reviews of the item.  All in all Seoul Food Market is a niche restaurant worth giving a visit. We'll be returning and trying different items next time.",

    "text": "The best chicken wings I've ever eaten were at this place.  So good I went back twice while I was in Charlotte.  I ordered them with the soy ginger sauce.  They were perfectly breaded with just the right amount of breading.   They were crunchy.  They meat was juicy with flavor.  Oh and there was a great amount of meat on the bones.  Sauce was perfect. Not too hot. Not too sweet.  Oh my goodness perfect.  Did I mention the best wings I've ever eaten.   Get them here.  I also ate some of their ramen and cheese (think mac me cheese) seemed a bit dry but had a great flavor.  We tried a variety of things on the menu but kept coming back to how delicious the wings are.   This place is busy.  Super busy.  Go early or prepare to wait. They have an outside space(two of them actually) the bar was great.  Drinks were different with great prices. Only disappointing thing that happened was because they were so busy I decided to get a to go order.   After I got my food and was ready to leave they opened the outdoor space.  Big Enough for everyone who was waiting if they wanted to sit outside.  So I asked if I could sit outside as well and eat my food.  They said no that I would need to go ahead and leave.  The girl even checked w the manager.  No, he said, I needed to leave.   So.  I did.  This won't stop me from going there again and ordering chicken wings.  But thought it was a bit short sighted on their part.  I would've bought drinks from the bar and would have ordered more food.  Oh, well, lesson learned.",

We cannot wait to go again! Service was exceptional! We have to go back and try the green tea sugar biscuits as they were out it this time. This place is definitely a diamond!!

I appreciate the wonderful flavor of all of their food, especially their wings! The soy garlic wings are unmatched to any other wing place I have ever been to. The seasoning is delightfully unique, the wings are huge, and the price is justifiable for the quality. Seoul Food also has great options in side dishes. They are quirky, hence Korean Fusion, and always very good. I would personally recommend the Kimchee Chili Ramen Mac. I get it every time I visit! Lastly, I know that this is a BBQ Korean fusion place, but their vegetarian options are delicious as well. Try to tofu wings or the potato swirl!",

I did not enjoy my ramen mac n cheese or the broccoli salad.  The beef ribs and pulled pork were fine, but nothing to write home about. The kimchi fries were also fine, but nothing especially amazing.  I also found their wings to have too much breading on them.   Perhaps I'd feel differently if I came on a Tuesday night for their $1 sides night, but to me for a full priced Saturday night, I thought it was perfectly fine, but not on the same level as it is hyped up to be.   Separately, they have SERIOUS climate control issues, especially in the Karaoke rooms. We rented a room after dinner one night and it was so freezing that I had to go to the car and grab a jacket even though it was the middle of the summer. They told us they couldn't do anything about it because the bigger rooms weren't as cold. For the amount they charge for drinks and for renting the karaoke rooms, they can afford multi-zone HVAC.",

This may be over kill for some but it's the hallmark of Korean fried chicken. The wings themselves were big and properly fried.

I think BAF stands for Big As Footballs or maybe Big As France, perhaps Big As Fireplaces.  Easily the largest wings by a mile. And perfectly prepared! Not rubbery undercooked and not fried to death overcooked. The website describes them as: \"Korean style, double-fried, finger-licking greatness. Our wings have a delicate, crackly crust smothered in fantastic sauces\". There are 2 sauces to choose from. Spicy BBQ or Soy Garlic. Both are completely delicious.  There, now you know about the best wings on the planet. The SFM Company also had something on their menu called \"not sushi\". Looking on the current online menu I don't see it listed. Good. It was awful and I was going to warn you, but hopefully they took it away forever.  Order the wings!!!",

We'd never had Korean food with a \"southern\" twist to it so tried a few of their side dishes. The kimchi fries were awesome, the chili was weird (noodles were bloated and soggy), and the corn thing (looks like someone's brain lol) was something I'd probably never try again. Overall good experience tho!",

    "text": "There has been a lot said about the wings here. So it seems redundant to say any more. That's not going to stop me, because they're delicious! I've had several versions of Korean Fried chicken over the years, and the wings here are some of the best. The texture on the outside is just perfect. And the sauces? So, so, good. There's no way I could choose between the flavors, I recommend getting both.   The sides are also great. The kimchi fries are excellent, and you get a sizable portion. The broccoli is served cold, and reminds me a bit of traditional banchan. It's a welcoming palate cleanser when eating some of the other very rich food.   Perhaps spoiled by the wings, we thought that the fire chicken was good, but not something we'd order again. That's mainly because we decided that wings AND chicken are redundant, and we couldn't ever not get the wings. The portion size on the chicken is large though. So if you want something not fried, it's a great value.",

The Mac and cheese was a small serving for the $5 price, and while decent, it was rather greasy. The wings were ok. Personally I think there was way too much sauce, to the point of not really being able to taste the chicken or the breading. So a bit disappointing to me, but I am a bit particular about my Korean chicken wings.",

    "text": "Was in Charlotte and wanted to get some food, and Seoul Food was close enough to where we were that we made a stop for lunch. Parking is most likely going to be street parking haha.  Even at around 3pm, there was a lot of people here (indoors was almost full) but we still found space. Looking at their menu, they have a large selection of alcohol (but I went for a specialty drink that is butterbeer). The butterbeer had a root beer taste to it with whipped cream and sprinkles on top haha. On to the food!  The meats that I went for: Crispy pork belly (Small $16) Smoked Beef Brisket ($16 for a small)  The crispy pork belly wasn't as crispy as it could have been, as it wasn't as crunchy as I'm accustomed to. The meat however was done well and had a lot of flavor. For the smoked beef brisket, the meat itself was missing flavor and just was alright for me.   They have chicken wings too, with two flavors being soy garlic and spicy BBQ Wings (Large 20 pieces is $20). I actually expected this to take a while to come out but it came out really fast (it was the first to come out). The spicy BBQ isn't spicy at all (I was a bit worried since I cannot handle spicy too too well) but the flavor here was done well. Chicken wings were the best part of the meal for me.  I also went for a Fried fish Taco ($4) which I took the fish and ate that by itself haha.   There is a huge variety of dishes here so there's a lot to choose from. However, other than the chicken wings and maybe the pork belly, I wasn't too impressed by the dishes and they didn't really stand out.",

We arrived early on a Friday evening and it was packed so there was a little concern that we would have to wait for a good while.... NOPE! We put our name on the list and we were seated within 8 minutes!   Our waiter was SUPER nice and very patient with my goofy friends that couldn't make up their mind on what they wanted to eat! If you're wanting to try something new, beer wise... try the Nipponia (Hitachino Nest Beer) it pairs well with the wings.   Since the food was made to order, we received our food at different times but almost back to back. From the time we ordered to the time we received the first meal, it was about 7-10 minutes. I really did enjoy their wings, but was not a fan of their tacos (I tried a friends and decided not to order one myself). If you have an event uptown/south end and want to have a quick meal before, then head over to this place. I'll definitely be back!",

If you're a Korean foodie like me and you haven't been here yet, ya sleeping. Wake up. I had already scoped the Yelp reviews before coming so I had an idea of what I was going to get.   Upon arrival, we entered the bar area. It may have been the rear of the restaurant and it had doors that lead inside as well from there. The back is decorated with a good amount of space to bring your dog. There's also a spot for you to play bags as well.   Ok now for the food cause that's what we came for. The meats. My bf ordered pork belly and a local beer. I ordered a medium (10 wings) 1/2 soy garlic & 1/2 spicy bbq, a bulgogi kimbap, & kimchi fries. No raegrets. You guys...I was stuffed. First off, the kimbap came out so fast! We were able to work on that before the rest showed up. It was so good! I should've had my bf order his own! I easily could've devoured it. The wings are thicc. Okay? At first I contemplated getting 20 because I wasn't sure how big they were going to be but baby all you need is 10. The kimchi fries stuffed me. These fries were loaded and so flavorful. From the meat, cheese, and kimchi...I got lost in it all.   Come here to enjoy the awesome atmosphere and bar staff! Bring your friends. Bring your baby. Bring your dog too. This place was a no brainer last night. I will be back!",

The soy sauce and garlic chicken wings were nice and crispy. Be careful when you pick these up they are physically hot. Next are the pork ribs. These are event with the dipping sauce.   Misses: the ramen and cheese. Would have been better baked. The crispy pork belly was too chewy. The fire chicken was not spicy like I thought it would be. Next time I will leave these items off and it will be better I think.   All in all we will most likely come back.",

The wings here are nice and crunchy but neither of the flavors are that great. The cheese corn here comes with the fried crackers, but it was only okay. I feel like this dish would be better as a hot dish instead of a cold one. The tacos here weren't bad. It comes with bulgogi and a slaw which went well with each other, but it's missing a sour competent that would take dish to the next level. Possibly a squeeze of lime? The one thing is really liked though was the pork belly. It was actually pretty good and tastes like Chinese bbq with a crispy skin and moist meat. Even with the pork belly being pretty good, I can only eat so much before getting tired of it. I wouldn't be able to eat more then a couple bites of all the items I tried. They all just seem to be sweet, salty, and/or fatty and I really needed something else to contrast all the heavy dishes.",

We got there around 7:30 on a Saturday, place was packed and we had to put our name on a wait list. I believe it took around 10-15 minutes for us to get a table, which wasn't bad considering how busy the place was.  They are a Korean - Southern BBQ fusion restaurant and I can assure you the fusion really worked.  The service was great and the food was served so fast I could not believe, specially because they were really busy that night.  I decided to get the soy garlic wings with Ramen N' Cheese  (Mac and cheese) and my husband ordered the crispy pork belly with Bao Bum (steamed buns). My wings were so crispy I could not believe it! Specially because they came in a soy sauce and they were not soggy at all. The Ramen N' Cheese was from another dimension, one of the best Mac and cheese I've ever had !!! The crispy pork belly was good but kind of blend so pouring the sauce the it comes with it is basically mandatory because it makes total difference in the flavor. The experience was pretty good but they are overpriced. They charge 4$ for each side and the dishes itself cost more than in similar restaurants in the area.  I would go back just for the Ramen N' Cheese itself, but with they prices probably I won't be back as often as I would like.",

I sat at the bar, ordered food, had a drink and was in and out in under 20 minutes.   The menu is on 1 page, which might seem small - but is packed with a lot of dishes. There's a huge app/small plates column which has a lot of dishes not clearly explained - so I pretty much used Yelp/pictures to guide my ordering. Here's what I ordered...  Ramen Mac & Cheese - good flavor, name says it all - exactly what you'd expect. Not the most upscale cheese sauce, but good drunken food quality at the very least.   Bulgogi (i think) Soft Shell taco - pretty much what you'd expect coming out of a food truck - but better! Loaded with meat, tons of flavor, yummy.   Fried Pork Belly - heart attack on a tray..lol. Super fatty, crispy skin, very flavorful, and comes with a really good dipping sauce.   Definitely would come back.",

I took my friends out to dinner & we were so excited to try something new. We ordered:  Fire chicken - this was actually pretty good although it was not spicy to any of us.  Kimchee fries - this was more like meat & cheese with French fries in it. Not bad but not something I have to ever eat again.   Wings - I really wasn't a big fan of either type & I honestly only remember the name of the soy garlic.  The other ones had this thick red sauce on them that tasted buffalo-terriyakisauce-soysauceish. My friends & I asked for blue cheese & ranch because they did need a dipping sauce.  We were told they don't have any & the owner forbids it because blah blah blah.  I think people should have a choice to have a dipping sauce. Especially in the south where ranch is life. I'm a blue cheese type of gal myself.   Pickled soy deviled eggs- I did not care for these AT ALL. Neither did my friends.   Pork belly- these were very dry. Some were crunchy but most pieces were not. Also, I didn't care for the sauce it came with. My friends kept talking about making mayo & pork sandwiches so they took it home. It wasn't bad but it was not that great either.  Sorry guys.  Pina colada lychee bubble tea - this was okay.   Overall, it was worth the experience. However,  it's not anything I need to have again & I don't see myself craving anything they have in the future.",

    "text": "My Korean friend, Tom, keeps expanding my taste buds for Korean food.  Today, we hit on my new favorite Korean restaurant.  I had the fire chicken which was served on a tray without a plate.  Honestly it looked like a huge slab of chicken covered in cheese.   To go with it, I ordered Bao Bao buns, which looked like uncooked rolls. I was advised that I needed these to sandwich my chicken.   Finally, I ordered a sweet potato bird's nest.  This was a basket of sweet potato strings drizzled with honey on top.   Everything I ate was a visual carnival AND really good.  The chicken was barbecued and had the best flavor.  The amount of food served was almost sinful.  I couldn't possibly eat all of it.  This restaurant has a trendy vibe, with concrete floors and very high ceilings.  As a result, the acoustics were not great.  Put frankly, it was just BLARINGLY LOUD. The entire experience was interesting and different for me and I was not off put by the noise level.  By the way, the bar area is impressive and every bar stool was occupied.   These millennials start their happy hours mighty early.  Oh to be young again!   I would gladly return here, but would take home a doggy bag.",

The wings are incredible- can't pick a favorite flavor, both were yummy! I loved the sweet potato nest, sweet and light, and the kimchi fries were the hot of the table. I subtract a star because they were having an event the next weekend and I messaged them multiple times for more details (I really wanted to participate but their promotion lacked a few key details) and was ignored. I want to be their biggest cheerleader but that left a sour taste in my mouth as I saw them reply of others and ignore me. Regardless, I still can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.",

We only tried one meat option - we wanted the pork belly, which was not available for at least another half hour, then requested the brisket - also would take an hour before it was ready. So - we had the ribs. The sauce was some type of soy and served on the side provided some flavor, but overall the meat was forgettable. The collard greens and deviled eggs were pretty good - again, not unique in any way. The Bird's Nest was a mess of sweet potato strings and had the potential to be good if not covered in cinnamon and sugar and floating in a pond of grease. Glad I tried it, because now I know, but will not come back.",

I am glad we checked this off our list because it was fun to try something new, but this is probably not our type of place.  We ordered the fire chicken, crispy pork belly, soy garlic wings, spicy wings and the kimchi fries.  Everything we ordered, but the chicken, was fried and that was a little overpowering for us.  The pork belly was good when hot, but when it cooled, it wasn't as good.  If we came again, we would definitely order a small wing sampler and lean towards the soy garlic rather than the spicy.  We would also order the fire chicken.  The fries were good.  We would skip the pork belly and maybe try some of the tacos we saw other folks ordering.  The service was great.  Top notch.  Tricky parking with all the construction in the area, but we eventually found a spot a couple blocks away.  Try it out.  You will probably like it better than we did.",

The ramen Mac and cheese was basically a square of ramen with a slice of kraft melted on top. The sweet potato birds nest was very greasy and hard to eat though it tasted decent.

I loved the manager and our server, both Kevin's, as they were very accommodating and efficient for my party of 35+.  My guests and I definitely enjoyed ourselves on their fun patio and their rock star karaoke room.  Only complaint was that random people who were there were eating from my catered food and the staff there couldn't really do anything about it.  A few times I happen to be out in that area I had to stop people myself from picking at my tables of food.  I understand it could be difficult to keep up with who was in the party and who wasn't so I would do it differently the next time around.  Also the bar staff was super rude, probably the worst I've seen or ever experienced (inside and out on the patio).  Other than that it was a memorable night.  Thank you Seoul Meat Co :)",

They were cooked well which I did enjoy but the flavors were not there, they unfortunately tried a bit to hard. I'll stick to my favorite Triple S wings at Greystone Pub down the road. The tornado potato was pretty good but nothing to call home about. It was pretty soggy. The service however was good, attentive for how busy they were. Overall not a bad place but I would never go there to eat again.",

Pork belly was flavorful with a candy-like coating.  Fire chicken was good, but very hot.  I probably will not order it again, but don't let that stop you.  Cracklings were great, and the seasoning was on point.  Potato swirl was outstanding, especially with the aioli.  Green tea ice cream was a bit less flavorful than I'd like, but the biscuits were a nice combo.  All in all, a very solid business lunch.  The bar is fascinating -- lots of options and flavors.  Will go back for Happy Hour soon.",

Reading few comments from some people being disappointed that it's not an authentic Korean restaurant and guess these folks still didn't get the news.  It's NOT a KOREAN RESTAURANT although I think the owner is Korean American with the name Seoul being the capital of Korea but the concept is not authentic Korean.  I think they did a great job even though it's only been open for few weeks? preparation is not the easiest thing to do in any business but you guys did a good job in a tough environment.

    "text": "I love Seoul Food.. Think Korean meets southern fusion. As a vegetarian, I was worried about going anywhere with \"Meat Company\" in the title, but I was surprised at what they had to offer. Everything is basically served family style, and the portions are large. First off, the drinks. I've had pineapple, melon, coconut and the yogurt soju so far. My favorite is the yogurt, it's just a tart yogurt drink mixed with a smooth soju. The pineapple, melon, and coconut are all served inside the fruit. They can be a bit expensive, but they're pretty big and are a blast to share with friends I'll say that the menu was somewhat limited for me, but I love what I get every time I'm there. I almost always get the tofu (wings). They are just large cubed pieces of tofu that are fried and covered in either a spicy tomato based sauce or a soy-garlic sauce. The soy-garlic is by far my favorite. These portions are extremely large. I'm never able to eat the small portion alone. The ramen cheese is exactly what it sounds, ramen but made just like mac and cheese. I would say that it is definitely good, but I think it is missing the creaminess of southern mac and cheese. The potato swirl is a must. It's a spiral cut whole potato covered in a sort of cajun seasoning. The sweet potato birds nest is a pile of sweet potato's cut like noodles that are put in a pile to somewhat look like a nest. The pimento corn cheese is a must for the pimento cheese lovers out there - though they are served with dried shrimp chips (but I love them anyways and make an exception). Overall the restaurant is adorable. It's decorated beautifully and I heard they are in the process of opening a back \"adult playground\" with multiple private karaoke booths for groups and parties. The service is top level, I couldn't ask for more. On Sundays they have a killer bloody mary bar, it's pretty impressive.. and I make it a point to go to Seoul Food before every panthers game and grab some tofu \"wings\" to snack on.",

I will need time and distance before I can go back for the only good thing we ate, which is the wings. Much of the menu was crossed off (which I can appreciate to a degree, if you can't serve it right, don't serve it). The waitress suggested we order a large of almost everything-which was hugely misleading on how these giant portions would come out. After getting sick, we threw most of the $90 meal away. Pulled pork, pork belly, and corn cheese dip, bao buns, were all pretty bad. The kimchi slaw was ok but the only \"veggie\" available. The meal made my wife and I very sick. The worst part, the restaurant had mostly empty tables and we were rushed out of there-like in and out in less than 60 minutes. Our waitress (who was nice but not really great) offered to go boxes less than 10 minutes after we got our food, and other servers were hovering the entire time and were coming by our table many times taking plates we were eating off of. Asking us if we were done. Really rude. Also had an $11 old fashioned and it tasted like water. Rough start guys. Hope you can get it together and stay.",

The way they make the wings extra crispy yet not overcooked on the inside hit the spot as I'm a wing enthusiast. The potato swirl was seasoned so well and the dipping sauce gave it the right amount of kick. It was like peeling off a potato chip. The sauce they use for the rice is very good. Not a strong flavor but it makes it better than regular rice. The crispy pork belly was on point. The dipping sauce is perfect for this meat and goes well with the dirty rice. I came during happy hour so my sides were cheap. I wouldn't mind paying the full price. A big portion of everything I had. I was stuffed yet still had some pork belly left. It was so good I pushed myself to finish it. If you're in Charlotte this is definitely the spot to hit. Only about 15-20 minutes from the airport.",

It's easy to say the food tastes good when it's served fresh and hot (because we are usually hungry at this point), personally I feel what separates SFMC from other BBQ joints, is the amount of time and details they put in from food preparation, presentations, to boxing your left overs.  let me put it in this way, I never thought leftovers are good until I had reheated the swirly potato chips, it was still crisp and maintained it's flavor. Of course the bbq and the beef rib were still tender ( never seen any BBQ place that will take the time to pack each item separately, they even saran-wrapped the beef rib to ensure it remains it's flavor and texture).  Not to mention the PRICE?!!?! For the quality and the amount of food with the little to nothing I paid for, I don't care who's going to be president 2016, I will be going there on the regular for sure.  There are two things I despite the most in Southend-  bad drunks and limited parking spaces. It's always a plus not have to worry about finding or paying for parking. They got a spacious parking lot in back. Once they open up the patio area, with the garage door open access to the bar, definitely a nice new hang out spot on game nights and weekends.",

We had the wings (both ways) crispy pork belly, bao buns, and ramen Mac and cheese. Everything was great. Perfectly seasoned, tons of flavor. The buns were perfect for the pork belly. It's a family style service, so make sure you don't order too much and it won't be too expensive.  Will definitely come back.",

I personally had the soy garlic wings and the kimshi taco, and the Brisket taco. The kimshi taco had a little kick to it and was very good. Don't get discouraged by the size of the taco because its packed with flavor, the Brisket taco was good as well. Lastly the wings we're fresh crunchy and full of that fusion garlic/soy flare very good! All in All i'll be back! I saw some other items I want to try!",

We've tried a good selection of the menu between us and what we've mostly enjoyed everything we've tried.  All the appetizers are good, some great. My favorite are the cracklins. The vinegar taste in addition to the spicy seasoning makes them unique and uniquely addictive. I even get extra to take home. The potato swirl is probably the next best.  Can't say I'm a fan of any of the meats other than the chicken, but the chicken is good.  Our favorites entree item are the wings. They are delicious and perfectly cooked. After experimenting with the menu, this is probably what we will be getting on all our future visits. (Okay, who am I kidding, I still need to try the tilapia...but after that, it is wings)",

    "text": "Found this place through Yelp. Was intrigued by their tag line... BBQ restaurant with Korean twist... Interesting fusion concept!   We got there around 6PM and was able to get seated immediately. Between the three of us, we ordered 2 main dishes and 3 sides. Here's my verdict:  - Beef ribs: ahhhmazinnnggg! Really delicious and love the sauce that came with it. Huge portion. We couldn't finish ours and had to pack the leftover. Ate it the next day and it was still as delicious.  - Fire chicken: it was OK. It was smothered in the spicy Korean paste and melted cheese. Did not enjoy the combo much and would probably pass this dish next time I eat here. (The paste is similar to the one you would get in your bibimbap dish in typical Korean restaurant but spicier)  - Ramen mac and cheese: interesting but nothing spectacular. The ramen noodle basically replaced your typical mac.  - Birds nest: love this! Crispy and delicious!  - Potato swirl: great sides. Came with some type of spicy aioli sauce?  - Great ambiance. They also have outdoor seating and several TVs inside  Will come back and try the wings next time! Seems like the wings is crowd's favorite judging on the orders from other tables ;)",

    "text": "Wow.  I had been waiting for a good time to get over and try out Seoul, and finally made the time with some friends on Saturday night. I repeat, wow. Nothing could have prepared me for the deliciousness that awaited.   My fiancee and I arrived around 7:45 to put our names on the list. We milled around the bar area and checked out the menu while waiting on the other two in our party. A couple of TVs in the dining room were playing college football games, and the two TVs at the bar were playing Korean (I presume) music videos with the audio coming thru the house speakers. The place was packed, which is obviously a good sign, and we were finally seated around 8:15.  While still waiting on friends we placed an order for the pimento corn cheese. A healthy scoop of the pimento corn cheese is served with what I can only describe as a potato chip that has the texture of a cheese puff... or a cheese puff in the shape of a potato chip. Anyway, so good. The sweetness of the corn was a great complement to the pimento cheese.  Once everyone arrived, we essentially just ordered everything on the menu. I personally got the pulled pork which had great flavor and the lightly drizzled sauce added a nice zing to the dish. I would highly recommend the Ramen Mac 'n' Cheese, a creamy mac 'n' cheese dish with ramen noodles serving as the pasta. I also tried the crispy park belly (meh), sriracha cracklins (great flavor with the sriracha powder, but I've never cared for cracklins), and the sweet potato birds nest (essentially stringy fried sweet potato rolled up into the shape of a bird's nest).  The service was excellent, especially given how busy they were. Our waiter (Jude I believe his name was [Hey Jude {great song |I digress|}]) took great care of us even though it was our first time, we were indecisive, and had SO many questions.   Hitting up the beef ribs next time with a side of who the heck knows?!",

We already had a reservation booked for the event and I specifically told the server that the bill for the room will be divided among 13 people, including the food and the drinks. Some of the people left early and the server forgot to charge them for the room. Instead when it was our time to leave, the server charged the entire bill for the room on my card. It was more than $120. He said it will take few days for the refund OR discuss among ourself to split the bill among 7 people ( 5 left early and they weren't charged for the room ). This really pissed me off, I specifically told him to split EVERYTHING and open a tab FOR EVERYTHING. I was having fun and enjoying my time until he CHARGED THE ENTIRE BILL ON MY CARD. FULL $120+ ON MY CARD. I had to pay everything and had to split the bill among the present 7 people instead of 13. What a BIG mistake he did and I'm really, really, really upset by this. I cannot emphasize how upset and angry I am at this mistake. The manager didnt even come to talk to me, or even to apologize for this grave mistake. I am never gonna come to this place again and never gonna recommend any people to this place ever. Period. I expect the restaurant to contact me immediately and do something about it.",

Then once that person arrived we waited for two hours before being sat. During our wait we were told that we were just waiting for another group of people to get up to be sat. The disheartening thing is that the hostesses were sitting smaller parties in the middle of open tables that could have easily been used for our party. The food was nothing to rave about and I was let down with its quality. When time to receive our checks we all voiced that the gratuity that was tacked onto our checks was doubled. We had to notify the server and we were told that the system did it by itself. They changed the amount and we paid. Scary how many people probably paid double the gratuity because they didn't notice it. I don't think I will be back. Nor would I recommend it.",

We walked in on a bright Sunday afternoon and was promptly greeted and seated. Our server Francis, came right over and introduced himself and took our drink order. I had the Panther drink which is a fruity refreshing drink. We also had strawberry Soju which was also refreshing with a bit of a kick. I had the Crispy Pork Belly, Green Tea Cornbread, and the Pimento Cheese Corn to eat. And EVERY bite I put into my mouth was pleasurable! The pork belly was so tender and yet the skini was crispy. I ordered a small, but the serving wasn't small at all. The cornbread was moist yet firm like a muffin. Exactly how I like my cornbread to taste. And the Pimento Cheese Corn was so good that you almost couldn't stop eating it along with the shrimp chips that came with it! The wife and kid shared wings as well which were amazing. Crunchy, slightly sweet outside. Tender meaty inside. What more could you ask for! They have a large back patio area with games for those who like to hang out, have a drink and good food while socializing.",

    "text": "First things first; what a beautiful space. I fell in love with the vibe of Seoul Food from the moment I walked in. Before we had even been seated, I was planning to bring friends and family from all over to this spot just because of the atmosphere.  I went for a Thursday lunch with my man. We were seated quickly after choosing to stay inside rather than outside; it was a particularly windy afternoon. We were seated right next to an open window. Normally I'd be happy with the combination of indoor and outdoor seating, but the leaves blowing in the window and into my face ruined some of the whimsy.  Our server arrived shortly, introduced himself, and walked us through the menu. Everything was pretty self-explanatory. We placed our order -- pork belly and sausage with a potato spiral and sriracha cracklins -- and excitedly waited for it to arrive.  I really like that they serve you on a tray for easy sharing. Everything we ordered was tasty, but for me, the cracklins stood head and shoulders above everything else. They were still actively crackling and popping when they arrived at our table. The flavor was delightful and they had just the right amount of crunch. As for the rest of our items, I enjoyed the potato spiral but found the accompanying sauce to be rather unfortunate. The flavor was unbalanced, too spicy, and it didn't complement the potato very well. The pork belly was nice, but arrived with no seasoning, and its sauce was also lacking for me. For $25 for the meat alone, I didn't feel as though we got our money's worth.  Once we'd finished, my date ordered the green tea biscuits for a light dessert. By this time, the restaurant had cleared out and we were the only ones left. Somehow, it took 20 minutes for dessert to arrive at the table. I can't imagine a scenario where that's acceptable. Once our server finally brought them out, there was no mention or explanation for the wait.  My biggest gripe is that there are very few gluten free options at Seoul Food. I enjoyed what I had, but with so few things to choose from, I imagine I'll end up ordering the exact same thing on every repeat visit -- and that's no fun. Seoul Food: if you're listening, expand your GF offering. We're a loyal people and we'd like to eat as well as everyone else.",

Overall, made to feel especially welcome at Seoul Food.  Ok - the food.  Pork belly was succulent and tender with just the right amount of crispiness on the skin. Portions are huge so go with a group if possible.  Or be prepared for leftovers that taste as good or better on Day 2.  Deviled eggs were delish and the sweet potato bird's nest (I think that's the name of the dish) was inventive while being quite tasty.  For a drink, I had a  margarita made with a hint of pineapple.  Worked for me!  Give it a try - well worth a first look...and a second look and...well, you get the idea.",

Our waitress was too busy cutting up with the other male workers to get her attention. Also, we had never been here before and ask to taste the sauce of the spicy bbq before ordering a large amount of just the one flavor wings. We were told emphatically, \"No\" without explanation. When pressed about the reason why, I was told it was against policy to taste the bbq. I stressed that I wasn't asking for a wing just a taste of the sauce since bbq sauces vary. I was told absolutely no that they don't do that. So we ordered our large order of wings that they touted as being the best and most famous.  At the end of the meal, we had a thought for our party split the minimum 6 of the spicy  bbq in order to taste it. Turns out, I like the spicy bbq better.  I would have ordered these had I been allowed to taste them. Also, I was not offered a refill  or a \"to go cup\" when the rest of my party was.",

Their food is mediocre at best which sucks since I had such high hopes for this place.  My family and I came in on a Saturday evening and it was pretty packed. We probably waited around 45 minutes before getting seated. The first thing we noticed was that it was hella loud. We practically had to scream at each other to converse.   Now onward to the food. Since I was so hyped about this place, I prepared my stomach to try almost everything on this menu. Needless to say I left frustrated with the quality of the food: Fire Chicken: probably the best thing i had here. The chicken was made really well and had melted cheese on top for flavor. Crispy pork belly: second favorite. Skin was really crispy but the fat from the pork was practically dripping when I picked it up. Definitely was a turn-off. Ramen mac and cheese: EW just ew. The ramen all stuck together and was cold when we got it. The cheese did not coat the ramen at all. Dirty rice: I can't get why they call this dirty rice. It was basically plain rice with some dressing on top.  Wings: Crazy amount of batter (I Understand korean fried chicken is known to have batter but dang it was a lot). Also a bit on the sweet side.  We also got other dishes from the menu but it's not even not mentioning. Quite honestly, save your time and go elsewhere. There's so many great options nearby.",

    "text": "I wasn't sure what to expect with Seoul Food but I hadn't read the reviews yet. The space is very casual and just as we sat down they dimmed the lights and cranked up the KPop music that accompanied the sexy videos on the TV monitors. Unfortunately the music became too loud to talk to each other but the videos did want me to break it down SYTYCD style.   The menu is modular so you can mix and match meats and sides which all come out in cardboard bowls or metal trays (like pizza). Food came out pretty quickly but not all at the same time. We ordered whole fried tilapia, sweet potato birds nest, Ramen Mac & Cheese, Pulled Pork and Bao Buns. It's not the best place to be organic / soy-free / gluten-free to be honest but I took a half bite of the Ramen Mac and Cheese and it was delicious and had wonderful crunchy toppings that added some robustness to it.  Hungry man loved the pulled pork and the delicious spicy BBQ that he put in the Bao buns. The BBQ sauce is the same sauce as the wings, so I bet those are awesome. The whole tilapia came out and was dramatic. It was glazed in soy chili sauce which unfortunately I can't partake in on doctor's orders, but what I tasted of it, it was quite tasty. However because tilapia is a small fish, there wasn't much meat and it was a bit dry because much of it was stuck to the fried skin. The owner/Manager(?) Tim checked in to see how the meal was and said they're changing the menu every day and taking in feedback. I should note that the sweet potato birds nest  is good but it's really more of a dessert than a side. It's fried in rice bran oil which is great, but it is also drizzled in honey and cinnamon so it's definitely sweet.   The mixed drinks were quite good- I had the yuzu citrusy \"jar\" which was like a lemonade with vodka and my husband got the closest thing to an Arnold Palmer which was perfect with the pulled pork!   Next time I'd really like to try the kimchi slaw and tomato salad and we'll probably sit outside so we can have a conversation. But here's how I'll leave how Hungry Man felt about this place. \"If we ate here in another town, I'd say 'I wish we had one of these in Charlotte.'\" I think that speaks volume.",

    "text": "Food:  If you never had KFC before (Korean fried chicken) then this is a must order. The chicken batter is soft but there's a crunch when you bite into it. They only have two flavors but the soy garlic & the spicy BBQ pack a punch of flavor in your mouth. Another item to get is the crispy pork belly. It's a unique take on traditional Korean Sam geyop sa. It has the right combination of being salty, soft & tender but also crunchy as they leave the skin on. The combo just works. The beef ribs looked like they got cut from a dinosaur. Yes they were that big but also very soft & moist. If you had traditional Korean BBQ chicken then the fire chicken is a must. The gochu jjang, the red pepper flakes and the chicken just work well together. Honestly everything was good from the ramen Mac & cheese, kimchi slaw, and the Sriracha cracklins (pork rinds) you can taste the traditional Korean flavors but with a American twist.    Look/feel:  When you first walk in you notice the Kpop videos playing on the screens and blaring from the speakers. It kind of makes you feel like you're in ATL or DC. They keep the lights dim but it brings out the total ambiance of the restaurant. The original mixed drinks also has names like, \"keep pounding punch\" & \"Hornets sting.\" Let's you know that they take pride in this city & the local sports teams. They haven't got the shipment of soju in yet, but that's something that I'm excited for. Soju is like Korean vodka and it's great when mixed together. Now they do have sake as well as Japanese & local craft beer.   All in all, the food was great and the ambiance makes you feel liked you stepped into Koreatown. Since this is a new restaurant they're still working out the kinks as well as working with a menu that isn't 100% established. But from what was sampled I can't wait to go back and to tell them to shut up and take my money.",

With the super crispy chicken wings, smell of gochujang in the air, and Kpop videos blaring from every tv screen...I was in heaven. The service was the best I have had since being in Korea. Our super friendly waiter Kevin explained the menu like a boss, took our order, and had our food out in less than twenty minutes. This place is not your typical traditional Korean restaurant, but it reminded me a lot more of places that my friends and I would go to living in Korea. I love that this place exists in Charlotte. Best dining experience in years hands down.",

    "text": "We had been waiting for this restaurant to open up for weeks and were so excited once they finally opened up their doors this past Saturday.  Unfortunately we were not impressed, and it was obvious that this restaurant was not ready to open.  We arrived around 7:30 and were told that they would only be serving $20 sample platters for 2 and with only select menu items.  This was pretty disappointing because my husband was so excited to come here to try the Korean bbq wings and they were not on the platter.  The platters of food were served only about 5 minutes or less after ordering, before our drinks, without silverware (had to wait for more to be cleaned), and without even hardly being able to speak more than a few words to the two friends that came with us.  Normally it is great for food to come out quickly, but the platters of food looked very sloppy and were served cold, which was surprising since they came out so quickly-- we're assuming we probably just got food that had been sitting out for a while.  The beef rib was delicious.  I was not a fan of the chicken or ham on the  platter (may be better if warm).   The mixed drinks were okay, but we thought it was a little odd that the menu did not list what ingredients/alcohol were actually in the drinks so we had to go down the entire list and asked what was in each one, which just seemed like a waste of time.  An entire glass of water was spilled on my husband with a minimal apology, but we just chalked this up to it being their opening night.    Taking into account that this was their opening night I am giving three stars, but it was more of a two star experience.  I am not sure if we will try Seoul again based on this experience, but I am hoping some positive reviews will come out once the kinks are worked through so that maybe we can consider giving it a second chance.",

Very bad insulation as well, the place is packed but still extremely cold.   Now on to the food, that I didn't get to eat. I came here for the wings, and requested a sauce sample to see which one I would prefer. The waiter argued that they couldn't do a sauce sample, no real reason just management doesn't permit it. I told the waiter that would be the difference between a sale or no sale.  He comes back a few minutes later with ramekins of sauce, that the manager approved because it was my first visit. Had the garlic soy dropped on me, luckily it was sealed. The spicy bbq sauce is neither spicy nor particularly tasty. The garlic soy is entirely too sweet, it may be decent on the chicken if that's what you're looking for.   My wife and her friend enjoyed their food, however it was served quickly which smacks of pre-cooking menu items rather than cook to order. I can't really suggest this place to anyone just based on the atmosphere and the fact that there was a weird hesitancy for sauce samples.",

    "text": "So I want to revisit this review in a couple of months because the place is promising. Georgous brand new spot of a repurposed building. Very minimalist and industrial in the design. The meat is on point though I will say what should be spot on interpretations of Korean classics leave a bit to be desired. I think all in my table had every meat offering that Seoul Food had on its menu (which, might I add, is a very targeted menu, very focused which I can appreciate). Everyone liked their main, though out of the wings the soy ginger was preferred and one would think that at a Korean place you could get a really good spicy (gochujang) bbq sauce. It was just alright. Meat portions were hearty and everyone left with the box. Service was good for a large party, though at the time the POS machine could not separate our check only tally which tested everyone's math skills and patience a little. So let's talk banchan. The sides were kinda weak all except the water kimchi which I would have hoped they gave me more of. The potato spiral was delicious as were the bao buns, really good to make your own steamed bun sandwich at the table. Yes, I get it we are in the south and maybe not everyone likes the traditional sides but we are an adventurous bunch in Charlotte, trust us a little more that you don't have to coat ramen with cheese or mute the heck out of kimchi with mayo and call it slaw. Unless it is delicious and thrn I am all about it. Have at it! My 3 year old, bless her heart, started a mini revolt because they had no soup (p.s. though there were kids and babies there it will take some creativity on parents' parts to find something for kids to eat before they can tolerate spice). She is more old school than me, I guess.   Meat company, I get it. I do. I will give up my wish to have traditional classic sides and try to get on board with the interpretations my only wish is that they execute them better to make me a believer. We are so almost there though. Definitely support them and I will be back to see how they evolve. And it is kinda awesome to see Kpop and Korean rap on the screens. Feels like a little piece of Seoul in the heart of Charlotte. A lot cheaper than taking a flight so when I get second home sick I will find myself there.",

AKA if your taste buds are looking for bulgolgi or bibimbap or those cute little side dishes that go with traditional Korean dishes... This is not it. They offer American cuts of meat - marinated in Korean flavors/spices. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottemagazine.com%2FCharlotte-Magazine%2FFebruary-2016%2FSeoul-Food-Meat-Co-Opening-Saturday%2F&s=80811c91a260de23bece057525c701a24b686c927c883750db6579167a287eac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">charlottemagazine.com/Ch...</a>  With that said... Their food is absolutely amazing and quite honestly is the only reason why I would go back.   They were ill prepared for this grand opening and have a lot to fix... The kitchen and process is number one. Two - their wait staff. They had one bartender on deck for a full house. All but one waitress (ours, her name is Kim. Ask for her) looked like a deer caught with headlights. They didn't smile and it was like they were scared of people.   Average table wait was a minimum of 1.5 hours. The first table that they seated I believe waited 2 hours.   Needless to say, customers were getting antsy... Some left. We ordered 2 XL large orders of their chicken wings to start (which smelled so good btw) - but it was sent back twice because the chicken was undercooked. Apparently they have small fryers. The wings eventually got nixed and I never got to try them. :(    They were also working off of a very limited menu: no crispy pork belly, no pulled pork, and more.   We were two seconds away from walking out at that point. The manager/owner (super sweet) came over and apologized profusely... Offered us a round of shots and also comped all of our meals. It was extremely generous of him and I'm glad he did otherwise we would've never tried their extremely tasty tender beef ribs.  I was extremely disappointed with the wait time, but the food is undeniably good.   I would highly recommend you try it out, BUT I would suggest waiting at least a month. This will give the owners time to fix the above mentioned issues... And hopefully by then they will be serving their full menu so you can try everything out.",

The atmosphere is really cool and its a good spot to just hang out and drink.  The back porch is a lot of fun to go watch a game or grab some drinks with friends.  They have a lot of beers on tap and even a fruit punch beer which is a combination of all the shandy and fruit lagers on tap.  They do have some quirks (no soy sauce and they won't serve a beer on tap on the back porch in the main dining area) but nothing to ruin your overall experience.  Strongly recommend to try this place out!",

Crispy pork was heavenly and the wings were flipping outrageous.  Don't sleep on the biscuits with green tea ice cream either.  P.S. the Kpop was a nice touch.  Simple things done extremely well at very reasonable prices.  Loved it!!!!  I can't wait to return.  Great service too!!!",

The atmosphere is nice with open garage doors, tv to watch the game, and open bar with dog friendly outdoor patio. The menu is creative and the food had the Korean flavor mixed with southern BBQ twist. The portion size of the meat was filling. My husband and I ordered 2 meats and 3-4 sides and couldn't finish it all. The restaurant is only 10 mins from the panthers stadium and has ample parking lot in the back. The servers were friendly and we received our food within 10 minutes of ordering (we were here Sunday lunch time.) I definitely recommend this place and the area is quite nice with brewery and coffee shop close by. My favorite was the chicken wings...has a great crunch to it!",

    "text": "HORRIBLE!!!  I checked this place out right when it opened.  While they only had about half of the menu available, at the service sucked, it was a unique concept that I wanted to come back to after they got their act together.  So I gave it a second try.  Big mistake.    I felt sick for 36 hours after eating here.  I pretty much just wanted to consume fruit, veggies, and water to purge my system of the filth that Seoul calls \"Korean\" cuisine.    \"Seoul\" food is more like \"Soul\" food and really really bad soul food at that.  There is essentially No Korean aspect to the food.  It is the greasiest, heaviest, heart attack on a plate that I have ever encountered.    I started with the chicken wings. They were huge and looked interesting. Then I took my first bite.... I have no idea what the hell the thick greasy crust was, but it was a lot thicker (and far less pleasant) than skin and a bit of breading. It took some work to get throught this grease rind to the meat.  Next was the pork belly.  Now I love some pork belly, just not Seoul's pork belly.  Parts of this \"crispy\" pork belly were hard enough to break a tooth on.  And the flavor was definitely lacking. This was a dish that could have easily taken an Asian angle, but again, there was nothing Korean about it.  Next up was the ramen mac and cheese.  Don't, just don't, Ever order this slop.    I really wanted to get the short rib but they only offered it in a massive slab.  I mean, i love a massive short rib but that was just way too much food for the two of us.  The short rib was really what got me to come back since i had enjoyed it the first time I dined here.  It would have been nice if my date could have tried it as it had a chance of being the one palatable thing that we would ordered.  Sadly, every single thing that we ate Sucked and was real waste of a Saturday night while also blowing through my quota for cholesterol for the next month.    The atmosphere was totally Frat-Tastic!!!  It looked like a frat house after the party ends.  Overly bright lights and every surface soaked with beer.    I'll never go back.",

Our bill was over $300.00 and the manager told us to \"fuck off\" when we spoke to him one on one. This place is also not dog friendly and was discriminatory, belittling customers and taking advantage of out of town visitors.",

Combining an extensive Japanese beer list with Korean influenced southern BBQ and sides is a winning combination.  Even the kimchi kimbap is good, especially for breaking up the salty, fatty meats.  Overall, order a hitachino beer, and anything BBQ'd. Add a kimbap and some sides (potato swirl, broccoli gochuchang and some pinch buns are all good ideas) and you'll be in for an above average, relatively inexpensive, dinner for 3-4 people.  The service can be hit or miss, especially when they're busy and the inside and outside are open.  Also, the water, if you're outside, tends to taste plastic-ey.  Still we make a point to come back every couple of weeks.  Also, if it's raining, stop by, as they usually have some drink specials to entice you in.",

The wings are incredible (bon chon vs here is a toss up though).  The sushi roll things are very good (and cheap), cracklings, potato spiral, fire chicken and pork belly are my go to foods.   Atmosphere is outstanding. Hands down the best fun bar scene in town and it even has a dog park!!! Just be careful bc the turf gets crazy hot there.   Drinks are great. Must try yogurt soju. Expensive but delicious.   The only draw back is that they have a bunch of no english speaking workers and they are kind of lacking in communication between front and back sections.",

Needless to say, it had better be worth fighting traffic and being stopped by people walking and big coach buses holding players.   And it was. It was definitely packed around the area but we found a parking spot and went in -- it was crowded and loud but we got a table for two quickly. Joey was our server and he was very helpful in giving us an overview of how things worked, and checked up on us frequently after we got our food, plus gave us the weekly specials that we could capitalize on later, which was super cool.  Of course, our eyes are bigger than our stomachs and we ordered way too much -- a medium half&half order of Korean-style fried wings, kimchi fries, and the brisket and pulled pork taco. We didn't know that the kimchi fries came with the bulgogi-marinated brisket, which was a pleasant surprise. For 4 bucks, you can't beat the side of fries -- they're a large basket piled high with kimchi and brisket and an aioli sauce. You don't need ketchup for those! We both liked the fried wings, although we agreed that the spicy one was probably better. It's not too spicy and the sauces are thick on both wings. You definitely need to wash your hands after those. The tacos are overstuffed with meat and pickled veggies and were great, although by the time we tackled those we were full!  As for drinks, I got the Lychee Temple, which is just a Shirley Temple with lychee flavoring -- really good as a contrast to the food there. Next time I will try a cocktail and see how that goes.   Overall an amazing experience! Definitely would like to try it again :)",

I've been here twice now, on my way to breweries, to load up on carbs and calories and would say they are very consistent with food quality. You should expect to wait during busy lunch and dinner hours. We put our name in and stood around the bar to kill time. Try the Sujo. We enjoyed the strawberry and were surprised by how delicious the lychee with yogurt was. Such a great experience pouring the drink into your cup while the steam from the dry ice spills out. We also had the ramen cheese which wasn't as great as I would have hoped. It seems they cook a block of plain ramen and then sprinkle some cheese on top. Nothing special. The steamed buns were top notch, definitely recommend giving those a try. Now this is a barbecue place so I would suggest you try some of their meat. I will say it's our second time to try the pork belly and each time we were disappointed to find that the crispy part of the pork belly is so hard it hurts your teeth to chew it. Seems a little strange although the flavor is great. We had the pickles to help cut through some of the grease we were eating. Everything you order comes out on a tray which is excellent for sharing and creating conversation. Will definitely be coming back next time we're in Charlotte but probably just for wings and sujo.",

We sat in the private room and the service was prompt despite the size of the group. Unfortunately, I was on a vegetarian diet this week which sucks if your visiting a restaurant with the words \"Meat Market\" in the name lol. I ordered the soy ginger tofu, sweet potato bird's nest and ramen mac & cheese. We also shared the a shake(I think) served in a watermelon, which was delicious. The tofu was not my favorite but my friend's wings looked delicious. The sweet potato birds nest was okay, it is similar to a deep fried sweet potato hashbrown. The ramen Mac & cheese was good. Over all the atmosphere is very nice and the next time I will definitely order the chicken.",

The sides are actually really big for $4 btw. We ordered a bunch of food, wings, fish tacos, potato swirl, ramen mac and cheese, pimento corn, Seoul garden salad, etc. The ramen mac and cheese was good but eat it while it's hot or else when it gets cold the cheese gets all stiff!!

I ordered the ribs, soy garlic & spicy bbq chicken wings and a side of kimchi slaw. I wasn't aware that it was a fusion of American flavors with Korean. The kimchi slaw was actually very disappointing to me. Kimchi is fermented cabbage and is my top favorite dishes of all time. It didn't resemble kimchi to me at all, and the kimchi flavor was sincerely lacking. The chicken wings were very crispy on the outside and juicy/tender on the inside. I personally didn't like the flavors. The soy garlic lacked a kick of flavor and the spicy bbq was a little bit too salty. The beef rib was predominantly fat which was seriously disappointing. It was tender, but way too fatty. I grew even more despondent when I found out there was no soju to be offered. All in all, I think everyone should go and give it a try, but just remember it's not your traditional Korean fusion.",

Our group was seated in a corner and literally had to squeeze between chairs to get to the table. It took our server about 15 minutes to acknowledge our presence. After ordering drinks and an appetizer, we waited 45 minutes for our drinks. The server didn't make eye contact with us, while other tables who were seated way after us were being served (and had drinks!) - the appetizer - wings - were delicious, perfect flavor, but no dipping sauce and lack of drinks didn't provide the best experience. We eventually were served water in plastic, cafeteria style cups... For the price, I expected a glass... Nonetheless. Our group finally got bar drinks after our appetizer was complete and we asked the server about our drinks... She said she would go kick the bartenders a$$??? Grapefruit beer was delish, but again, after 45 minutes I would hope so. We ordered the fire chicken and lots of sides (they were out of pulled pork) - Everything for your table is served on one tray and you serve yourself in a paper tray. Chicken was not tasty, nor did anyone really eat it. Ramen Mac and cheese was similar to ramen and cheese wiz. The Bao buns were interesting and good. Corn pimento cheese, rice, pork rinds, and slaw has way too many competing flavors that just didn't jive. While in the restaurant you will be treated??? to Asian music videos that are somewhat lewd in nature... We were confused by the purpose. If I went back, I would only have the wings and bounce. You will find better service at McD, and I hate to say it, meal, too. Will not be surprised if place does not make it.",

Anthony G. was superb and another gent (probably a manager) who asked us how stuff was, immediately got us even crisper pork belly (with still-juicy meat) at no extra charge.  They obviously aim to please, completely.  Fusion has become an overused cliche, but here it very aptly describes Southern style cooking of Korean favorites emphasizing the best of both worlds.",

When we were sitting a customer urgently warned us about a certain dish to steer clear from( ramen noodles covered in cheese).I didn't cause a scene because it's my good friend's birthday....let's begin though, backstory aside. The menu is pretty unimpressive so to be safe I ordered the braised fish tacos. They're drowned in cole slaw and cucumbers....quite frankly they're disgusting. I took a good look and slid it away. I told the waitress I didn't want the food and she called the manager out. He condescendingly explained to me that he isn't running a tshirt business and can't resell my tacos and that I could try something else because he was still going to charge me. The food here is trash..the service is as well.I won't be back and you (the reader of this review) shouldn't come here to begin with. There's nothing Seoul-ful about this food. Horrible establishment",

So, naturally, I thought I was going to absolutely love Seoul Food Meat Company, but I felt like I was missing my favorite parts of both cuisines. I went with my cousin and we had a beef rib, pork belly, a half-and-half order of wings, the spiral cut potato, and some kimchi slaw.   The beef rib was ok. It was a large short rib marinated like kalbi and supposedly smoked. There wasn't much smoke flavor, but that could be due to the fact that it was cooked medium. It took some effort to get the meat off the bone. Generally with smoked BBQ, it should only require a gentle tug to pull the meat off the bone (it should not be falling off).   The fried pork belly was delicious. I have never seen pork belly like that in Korean or BBQ restaurants - but it is common in Filipino cuisine as lechon kawali or in Chinese cuisine as siu yuk.   The Korean fried chicken wings were decent. Not the best I've ever had. The SoGa (soy garlic) was pretty tasty, but the hot flavor just tasted like kochujang.   Honestly, the sides were ok, but I wish they also had straight up kimchi.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! Moved here about 5 months ago and I've been trying new places every single weekend--this is one of the only restaurants I've been back to almost once a week! The food is absolutely delicious and very affordable. This is especially True if you go with someone else or a group; all their food is shareable so you can try a lot of the menu for a low cost. The drinks are reasonably priced and when it's nice outside their outdoor patio is a great place to hang out! I've been here for sporting events, dinners, and casual drinks; all times have been a superb experience. They have private karaoke rooms here and I haven't tried it out yet. Will update review once I get in there to sing some tunes.  Note: if you happen to be a Georgia Bulldawg this is a fantastic place to watch the game during the season! My wish for Seoul is that they can do some drink specials throughout the game for the Dawgs. This would attract a lot more Dawg fans on gameday!",

Typically when I see small plate share-ables around $4-$7 I think, \"you're going to need to pile up\". Not the case! 1 taco would have been enough protein for me. The Pork Rinds were the BEST I've ever had. Perfect flavor and so filling. The Pork Belly was also incredible. Crispy and flavorful. The large portion can feed 3-4 people easily. The Sweet Potato Birds Nest is incredibly difficult to eat (spiky little shredded strands of sweet potato crisped into a nest shape), but was delicious.   I will say that all of the food is served on trays or cardboard boats. Not a spot I'd bring Mom, but an awesome place for friends!  We were in a Karaoke private room for the evening celebrating a birthday. They were super cool with letting us bring in our own birthday cake. Our server was hard to get the first 2 hours (drinks got low and empty!), but he kept apologizing and definitely made sure to take care of our bills promptly. (He also reminded is that gratuity was included, which was really classy.)  Overall this was a hit! Can't wait to go back.",

Ordered bulgogi and squid kimbab but like squid better. When I tried squid kimbab before, it was not that spicy as I remember. Just be aware when you order squid kimbab, it can be very spicy sometimes. The pork belly was awesome! The balance of crispy skin and tender pork is perfect. First time to try and you should try if you love crispy pork skin. Kim-chili was spicy chili with kimchi in it but not as spicy as squid kimbab! This is my favorite place with outdoor game area and good food. But it will be good to avoid certain busy times as it will be so packed and bathroom lines will be too long lol",

The first day that my husband and I moved to Charlotte, we finished unloading the truck and decided we desperately needed a beer and some filling food. With our pup in tow we googled \"Dog friendly restaurants Charlotte\" and Seoul Food came up. When we arrived we were led to the enormous back patio where they have a bar, tables, and a fenced in dog area! We let our anxious pup run out some energy while we sat and scarfed down chicken wings and beer. I don't think we have found better wings in Charlotte since. Beyond that, everything that we have tried has been delicious, from ramen mac and cheese to the whole fried tilapia.   We have brought several visitors here and everyone has left impressed and full. They've especially love the Frose and the Bloody Mary bar on Sundays. I can't recommend this place enough.",

    "text": "I feel like Seoul is that person you knew in school who so desperately wanted to be part of the \"cool\" crowd but their efforts always felt a tad forced. For a dining establishment, they have all of the wanna-be elements: bar with local drafts and flavored beers, outside patio which also includes an area to play games, and a dining 'concept' that sounds equal parts interesting and completely made-up.  The concept is that they're not a traditional Korean restaurant but lean more heavily towards southern BBQ fare, yet find a way to combine the two. For my last visit, I went with a group of coworkers (most of whom had already dined here before, only two had not) and the two newbies were still completely confused after the waiter gave the restaurant's elevator pitch.  If you are a newbie to Seoul, please note there is a dedicated parking lot. It's small and will fill up quickly during peak times, as to be expected. Hopefully, you'll be able to score a spot on the surrounding streets. You can choose to dine inside or outside. For the patio, they have water misters going on hot days. The menu is a la carte because sharing is caring! Also, there are themed karaoke rooms (such as a country, hip hop, etc) that can be rented per hour, obviously you will have to book these rooms in advance.  Food: most people are going to tell you to get the wings. Personally, the wings have not blown me away and you get more breading than you do meat but I'm in the minority here when it comes my opinion of their wings. So I'd say try them because you may like them.  However, my recommendation is the kimchi fries. The fries seem to most encapsulate their fusion concept. There's meat (bulgogi), some sort of Asian dressing sauce, and a traditional Korean element, that being the kimchi. They're just the right portion size and do a good job of soaking up any alcohol you may choose to have with them.   As for drinks, I'm basic and have had the grapefruit shandy (comes served with a slice of grapefruit). You can't beat a citrusy beer on a hot, summer day. Also, when dining with a group, go with one of the flavored sojus. My group of coworkers and I easily sucked down the watermelon soju.  From the bartender to the waiter, service was excellent. All were super friendly and willing to describe any menu items/offer suggestions.",

Best way to describe this place is fun! fun! and more fun! Myself and one of my other friends went in $10 each and purchased the all you can drink mimosas the bartender brings out a bottle of champagne and you mix it up yourself from their mimosa bar its a do it yourself bar really cool idea. My other friend purchased the pineapple soju drink its a   pineapple where you swoop your drink out wit a utensil that comes with the pineapple. They have alot of cool drinks here with the smoke coming out of the drinks etc.. One of my friends mentioned i never been anywhere where i complain to myself we have to much to drink lol we definetly got a great bang for our buck.  This is not your traditional korean restaurant  i didn't expect to have as much fun as we did. This is a great place especially while the weather is still warm outside to go with a group of friends.In the back they have a great open space patio with adult games out side such as jenga and connect four. We were like big over grown kids outside playing while drinking. I also especially love the open window bar space in the bar in the inside as well its inside but its outside if that makes sense. If you are looking for a non traditional korean restaurant come and get the great experience me and my friends did here at Seoul!",

The go-to dishes I like to order are chicken wings, ramen and cheese, and the large rib. I'd also like to note this is a place where you can order multiple items and share if you aren't alone.  I've been here numerous times and the food + drinks are always consistent. I've had issues with service once but overall staff are friendly and the food is good.   Be ware that parking is a little rough in this area but that's southend for ya. It's better to uber . . otherwise look for street parking near by.",

I got the spicy tuna kimbap which wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but tasty none the less.  It looked kind of cooked?  Maybe?  I dunno.  Also got the kimchi fries.  Not quite as good as the bulgogi fries from Banh Mi brothers, but still damn good.  You could spend some money here eating, or you can eat on the cheap.

As they state on the website it's fusion not traditional Korean bbq. I enjoyed the crunch of the pork belly and the bbq sauce. The kimchi fries were the best combo of kimchi, sauce and potatoes. I enjoyed the flavors. The spiral potato had spices for the sauce, came on a skewer and had amazing flavor.  Good service and cool modern decorations at Seoul!  The soju alcohol drink was like a yummy sour patch kid flavor, you drink in shot glasses. The entree comes in family style so be prepared to share. We liked the food and one entree and two sides was plenty of food for two.  They had a parking lot behind the building, easy for lunch.",

We also ordered Bulgogi Tacos which were also very good. While I've had better tasting Bulgogi Tacos, I've never had such good Bulgogi Tacos for only $4 bucks. If I'm ever in the area I'll definitely drop by for some cheap and delicious foods!",

    "text": "Wow.  Best meal I've had in recent memory.    This place has quite a reputation in Charlotte, and it turns out it's all for good reason.  We believed the hype, and knew we hard to give it a try after first trying its neighboring restaurant, Let's Meat.    We weren't able to park (surprise surprise for Friday night in South End), and were told that they couldn't quote us a wait time due to there being 15 people on the wait list.  We said this was fine and waited at the local brewery, Wooden Robot, also incredible.   We were seated faster than expected (around 30-45 mins altogether).  We opted for the following:  -Crispy Pork belly (small order) -Half and half wings (small) -deviled eggs -kimchi fries -kimchi pork taco.    Everything was amazing.  The wings were by far the best.  Crispy, perfectly fried and deliciously sauced. We did the half and half to try both, but would definitely get all soy garlic next time.  The kimchi fries came second, delicious and also perfectly fried.  The meat was good, though not as good as Let's Meat in terms of marination/seasoning.  The taco and deviled eggs are definitely items you would be better off replacing with something else on the menu -- good, but not knockouts like the rest.    The price is INCREDIBLY reasonable.  For all of the above was $40, and way more than enough food.  With $1 sides Monday-Thursday, Seoul Food is more than fair on price.    Overall, this place is amazing, as evidenced by how busy it always is.  Make it your next stop in South End.",

Seoul describes itself as a southern style restaurant with a Korean spin and it is comfort food perfected! The soy garlic wings are a must, I typically can't eat more than 3.  Also a huge fan or the fire chicken.  For sides I tend to stick with the Philly cheesesteak egg roll which is very tender and cheesy, and the kimchi fries which are enough to share! Have liked everything I've tried, the only thing I was lukewarm about was the sweet potato birds nest which was a little difficult to eat.",

Our server throughly explained the process of how they serve food.  We all ordered THE WINGS!! Omg! My faves are the soy garlic. So flavorful. I also ordered the the Philly bulgogi egg rolls and the fried fish taco. The taco was a little underwhelming as I felt like it was missing a spice or sauce, idk. The egg rolls were pretty tasty (sans the dipping sauce as I do not like mustard). Oh and I tried my friend's ram n cheese (baked ramen \"Mac n cheese' and it was surprisingly good!  Of course I will back Bc wings duh! The crispy pork belly is on my list for next time.",

Once you get your food you won't even be bothered by the noise!  I usually just like to order a bunch of things and share since it's small plate style.   The wings are of course my favorite! Just so delicious.  Portions are huge! The pork rinds are made in house. They literally kept popping/sizzling HOURS after leaving the restaurant. Kinda weird, but at least they were tasty.   The collard greens had a surprisingly good flavor.   Philly egg rolls...delicious!   Go and just order a bunch of stuff!!",

The environment was friendly and casual. our sever wasn't extremely vibrate but he we got our food out in a timely manner and he was cordial. The wings are HUGE and only come in two flavors ; soy garlic and spicy bbq. I like hot stuff so the spicy bbq was my favorite but my friends all picked the soy garlic . They weren't bad just not my favorite. I ordered a small which was 6 wings and honestly it's enough because they are really big. Makes me wonder what kind of hormones are they putting in them birds lol. I also had the fish tacos and they lacked favor. It needed some seasoning and more sauce. Overall I enjoyed it and I'll be back.  Parking is limited during the day, but there is street parking.",

We ordered the medium order is winds, half soy garlic, half spicy BBQ.   The wings came out immediately somewhat warm. The fries arrived about 10 minutes later. When I questioned whether or not the wings were prepared to order, I was told yes and that the fries take longer...  The wings were as hard as a rock. The waitress did not offer to bring out another order. So I ordered a Fried Fish Taco while my boyfriend finished the Rock hard wings and cold fries (oh yeah, they didn't come out hot either.   The waitress came to our table twice while we waited on my one fish taco asking if we were good... I told her I'd let her know when I got my taco. We waited another 20 minutes for my taco. My boyfriend finally asked for the check and to cancel the order for the taco. At the same time the one fish taco arrives at the table yep you guessed it COLD!! We sent it back.   The owner then returns to the table with the taco asking if there was a problem. I explained the issues with the food. She then began to explain how they prepare their food. I again explanted that the food was not fresh. She then simply said fine and walked off.   Had the customer service been better I would have considered returning. However, I will NEVER go there again.",

My favorites were the shrimp chips with pimento cheese and ramen mac & cheese. My husband and son said the tacos were fantastic!  I was disappointed with the kimbap. I've had better at Korean supermarkets.   Unfortunately, we will not be returning to Charlotte anytime soon, so I'll have to try to duplicate some of the dishes I ordered.",

He had a great cheery attitude and he really took care of us. My go to is the fire chicken that I put into bao bun! That is after I eat about 5 wings! Both flavors are great. These wings are huge!   I also recently went on a Wednesday for their $1 sides from 4:30-5:30. Yes, $1 sides- that means deviled eggs, ramen mac and cheese, potato spiral, etc. And the best thing of them all the kimchi fries!!  Victoria P. was awesome! We were seated outside and she took such good care of us!  You have to love this place! Plenty of games outside, small dog run and karaoke rooms! It gets busy on the weekends, so be prepared   And my most recent $1 app visit was Tuesday and David, our server was awesome! I tried something new, the pimento corn cheese appetizer. This is a game changer! 1. It's a large side and shareable 2. The chip things are so different and just melts in your mouth 3. It's amazing!   It looks like some upgrades and remodeling is happening on the back deck. It looks good so far!  Like I said, I'll keep coming back! Love this place!",

When you come to this restaurant be prepared to wait because it is extremely popular. They won't give you a wait time but will tell you how many parties are in front of you. I did not like that because, i rather her have a range of what time I'll be seated. However we waited maybe 20 minutes for our table, which isn't bad.  Our waitress was decent. She was able to answer our questions but after we ordered we rarely saw her. I truly forgot what she looked like because she did not really come back our way.  Everything is a la carte and comes out when it is ready. Meaning all your food won't come out at once. We ordered the rum punch( too sweet), jumbo wings, ramen Mac and cheese, fish tacos, kimchee fries, and philly egg rolls. I could of gone without the ramen but everything else was so good.   The best part the restaurant is extremely affordable( the egg rolls were around $5 for 2).   Everyone needs to try this place at least once",

They're known for the chicken wings or meats and sides such as kimchi fries. And they do Korean/American southern bbq very well. Located close to the university, I was immediately turned on by the trendy vibe here. It's a fun place to hang out and have a hand crafted cocktail. Our wings were flavorful and juicy. Our server explained everything perfectly and even gave some recommendations that we happily tried. This is definitely a place I would return to.",

She informed me that in addition to their $1 sides they currently had half-off draft beers. I knew I was going to be getting 5-6 sides, so I went with a light Sapporo for $2.   I ordered the deviled eggs, which came out lightning fast and were flavorful and shockingly filling! I also go the bulgogi & porkbelly egg rolls, which were good, but lacking in the meats. The dipping sauces they came with were so good, though! I got the Ramen mac n cheese chili and had this with the green tea cornbread. The gt cb is incredible, but when paired with the Ramen mnc chili, it is next level! The  Ramen mnc chili was really good as the ramen mac is under the chili and when mixed gives fantastic flavor + texture! I finished my sides tour de force with the sweet potato birds nest. This thing is massive and definitely made to be shared! The crunch and sweet potato w/the brown sugar/cinnamon was great and it was a nice end to the meal.   I ended up adding another Sapporo to the mix and when all was said and done w/tax & tip, my total was $14. For sure, one of the best HH in CrownTown!  They do have a parking lot and street parking did not seem to be a problem that time of day on a weekday. Staff were friendly and the food was brought out in order ordered and quickly. I even loved the Korean music vids they had playing.  I will definitely be back to explore more of their main menu and try even more their sides!",

When you walk in you are greeted with the sound of K-POP jamming on the speakers and may even get a glimpse on the TVs scattered around the room. Once your seated the menu may seem a little confusing, however our server did an amazing job explaining everything. If you come here order the wings, they are incredible delicious and crispy. They only have two flavours soy garlic and spicy bbq, but they both are delicious so order both. We also ordered pulled pork with buns, Mac n cheese ramen, and cracklings which had a spicy dusting on them. I had to wash that delicious food down with a nice cold draft Sapporo.  I must say what I really enjoyed about this place besides the great atmosphere, is that the food is served family style and it comes out very quick as a small plates restaurant. I am definitely coming back to try some more amazing food and maybe take some pictures next time(I was too hungry and forgot to snap a pic of the food).",

    "text": "Well, just got into Charlotte for the weekend for a wedding. A nice and tiring 7 hour plus drive because of all the traffic on 77 coming in. Checked into the hotel absolutely starving. At 8 PM, most things are closing so options were a bit limited. I almost just settled for ordering in pizza but decided to Yelp the area a bit first. Seoul Food came up on the first page. Read some of the reviews suggesting that it was a nice fusion between Asia and good ol' fashioned comfort food. I decided 4 stars on Yelp was worth dragging by sorry butt out of bed and make the drive out.   At first, I thought I was in the wrong area. Then you see this building well lit. The outdoor areas had a dog park (AMAZING!), corn hole (or bags if that's what you call it), pool with soccer balls, and a nice outdoor seating area. Walked in and the ambience just screamed clean with a hip vibe. Sat at the bar (eating solo and felt less lame that way haha). The service was quick. Bartender was knowledgeable about beer selection and made great suggestions based on your likes. I ordered the pork belly, kimchi fries, and green tea corn bread...a bit ambitious, I know. The food was out within minutes. Being Asian, I'm really picky about my roasted pork since that's a staple in our diet. Their's was spot on. Skin had the nice crisp and chewiness that is iconic. The meat was juicy with a nice char on the outside. If I had one comment, it would just be that the meat was lukewarm when brought out to me. Not cold by any means but just not with that warmth that I grew up with. The corn bread was on point. Nice crunch on the top, soft and moist inside with a perfect hint of green tea that by no means overpowered the taste of the corn. The kimchi fries...how do I even begin? The fries were fries...nothing to blow you away. But the toppings...wow. Kimchi with some mayo aioli and a layer of bugolgi. This absolutely made it. I would definitely come back to this joint to try the other items on the menu.",

My friends and I visited on two separate occasions last month, one of which included utilizing one of their amazing Karaoke Rooms, and another just me and my husband for some dinner. WOW!  The food here is incredible.  I wouldn't necessarily say this is traditional Korean food, but I would say that its so delicious and doesn't even matter! The wings are out of this world delicious, as is the Ram & Cheese, the deviled eggs and the tacos! I would pass on the broccoli if it were me!  The Karaoke rooms are rented by the hour, they do not take reservations, but its a FUN time for a large group to sing with their friends only.",

Super authentic like what you could find in bars/eateries in Korea! Only reason I knocked off a star is the service is spotty. It's either on point or it'll take you 30 minutes to get your drinks. It might help to get those call buttons for service for waiters like in Korea;) other than that, it would be 5 stars!",

The manager was nice enough to provide us the room with our party because we had two little ones with us. The menu was pretty simple and meant to be shared. A few of my favorites that we ordered were the kimchi fries, crispy pork belly (it's the Filipino in me....reminded me so much of lechon), and the sweet potato birds nest which was crispy with the hint of honey! I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Uptown Charlotte. The parking was tough, there were limited spots on the side but we managed. It was the first day of College Football that's why it was packed otherwise I'm sure it's not too bad any other day. I can't wait to be back here the next time I visit!",

For the sides we ordered the dirty rice x2 (soo good) broccoli (it was fresh broccoli with gochujang sauce on top) and the kimchi ramen chili (good but tasted more like chili than kimchi). We also had the extra kimchi cucumbers which was really good! We also got the The potato swirl which was ok at best.   For dessert it was the green tea biscuits. Basically was green tea ice cream with doughnuts which was awesomee. One of the few places id say id come back for!",

I ordered the Bao buns, Sweet Potato Hash, Spicy Ram n' Mac, Lychee Soju, and I took on the WHOLE FRIED TILAPIA!!! Everything was AMAZING; however, the Spicy Ram n' mac tasted more like buffalo sauce than a take on mac & cheese. Was tasty, but I was expecting a hometown favorite.   Now...the tilapia....  THE most tender, juiciest fish I have EVER had in my 25 years of Life!! Honestly, if it weren't for the bones, I would have inhaled the entire thing in one large bite. DEFINITELY recommend, if patient enough to be wary of bones.   Lychee Soju was great. Came in a personal shaker and didn't initially TASTE strong, but the second I got up, I felt the entire shaker hit at once. VERY tasty, though  If the Ram n' Mac was cheesier, I'd give Seoul a 5-star rating.",

Seoul Food Meat Company is an excellent barbecue establishment with huge portions of perfectly fried/smoked/grilled meats with just a very small hint of Korean flavors. If you are not an adventurous eater, the meats are not very diverse in flavor and you will find familiar favorites. My favorite was the Beef Rib and the Fire Chicken, both are perfectly cooked with just a hint of that amazing Korean kick.  If you want to get crazier, the sides are really what you should focus on, there's a variety of 12-15 or so sides, each one looks better than the next. Ram N' Cheese was actually surprisingly not terrible and one of the better of the indulgent sides. Be warned though, they will fill you up!  The service is also super friendly and the dining area is very clean. I love the natural lighting the place gets during the daytime. Would definitely recommend to a friend, especially if it's their first time in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Cute spot located in South End that specializes in southern inspired dishes with an Asian fusion. The wings are everything which I would recommend the soy garlic wings. Their speciality drinks are a little lite on the alcohol but when you ask for a drink not on the menu the drinks came back amazing, I'm thinking cause they looked up the ingredients . One of my friends ordered the deviled eggs which looked green to me so I passed but he loved them lol.   They have a wonderful patio which in the south can be good and bad with the heat we sweated our butts off but it was well worth it. They play Asian videos and music that are very close to hip hop and R&B which was really cool.   They also serve drinks in actual fruit like coconut and watermelon that I want to try but with real alcohol lol. Anyway very cool spot to try and the service was great.   Hidden gem, a must try",

This last time I had dined there the bartender asked if I was a strict vegetarian and had informed me that the tofu wings are fried in the same oil as the chicken wings. It really bothers me that this is not clearly stated anywhere on the menu and the staff does not bother to say anything about this. I am so very grateful for the bartender that did speak up and let me know. However, I now know there is nothing truly vegetarian friendly here despite what the restaurant says.",

We did find our food runner to be a tad awkward. She brought our food to the wrong table twice and each time when she realized it was our table, she just awkwardly dropped it off with no eye contact and just slithered away. It would have been nice for a smile or anything... But no.   Moving along to the food, we got the Korean ribs, pull pork taco, brisket taco, collards, and wings. The Korean ribs had no flavor whatsoever, we were blown and shocked. The tacos were just okay .. as were the collards. The wings were just okay too, they did have a little too much sauce on them and plus we had like only two napkins on our table...yikes.  Overall we probably wouldn't come back for the food but maybe for drinks later in the future. This place has great potential but needs more flavor profiles in their food.",

The food comes out extremely quick but the service is so-so...minimal water refills and may forget if you asked for a condiment or side. We had high hopes for the food though - we ordered the half and half wings and while the flavor was awesome they were SO fried, like the most deep fried wings I've had to date. We also got the BBQ pork which was pretty good, the Sausage that was cold BUT maybe it's supposed to be served that way? Our waiter wasn't around for us to ask. And the mac n cheese sounds great but really its like ramen noods with non mixed in cheese and pork rinds on top. Overall - I may come back...but probably only for drinks and a good hang out spot.",

Bear in mind that everything is 'a la carte' but to me, that's a good thing because I'm one of those people that often doesn't want a side and then wastes a boatload of fries that comes with my meal, or wants all the sides and gets some major upcharges. Rather than substituting or wasting food- you order exactly what you want and it's the perfect portion. Not to mention the food is delicious! I recommend the wings, as they are HUGE, crispy, and have the perfect flavor. If we're being really real though, my favorite thing on the entire menu is the spiraled potatoes. They somehow cut a potato into one big spiral, put it on a stick with some kind of heavenly seasons and then deep fry it and it is honestly the best a potato you could possibly get. If you go (which you should), definitely try the potatoes! This place will not disappoint!",

We decided to split 3 large orders of meat and two sides a piece. Our eyes might have been bigger than out stomach. We were all stuffed and we still had a few small left overs.  Wings and pulled pork were definitely the favorites. Large crispy wings with good flavor and very juicy. Tender, moist pulled pork with a little sauce on top and extra on the side. We had the kimchi spare ribs as well. They were good and tender, but for $ 6-7 more than most of the other meats, I probably won't get it again.  As for sides we ordered the potato swirl, Pimento cheese with shrimp chips, Bao Buns, Ramen mac n cheese, spicy cracklins ( pork rinds with siracha dust). The swirl was good, but very small. Buns serve a good vessel to shovel the vast quantities of meat in. Pimento cheese was very tasty and good for sharing. Ramen was not that good, cracklins are good but nothing special.    Overall, the meats are definitely the star here, but here. Good value for the amount and quality of food you get. We'll definitely be going back again.",

The sauce on the whole fried fish was delicious however I did find it very hard to eat with all of the bones and couldnt find a lot of meat. I guess that's what you get when it's whole fried lol. As far as the sides, the pimento cheese corn is bomb. Would recommend as an appetizer, it's served with rice chips. LOVED the tomato ponzu. My one complaint is the cheap flimsy cardboard lunch boat they expect you to eat out of. Please upgrade to regular plates!!     Cant wait for the full menu to roll out!!",

I ordered a vodka soda, and when I looked at it, it was entirely carbonated through the drink (unusual for a drink with alcohol in it).  I proceeded to drink it as well as my buddies, almost entirely club soda.  I then asked the bartender to poor me a different drink and confessed that I had witnessed her do the same thing prior to my order.  She proceeded to cry and ask, \"are you calling me a liar?\" -multiple times and as it got very awkward for me, she asked me if she could buy me another drink, I really did not want a drink bought for me on a bartenders tab.  She then went around the bar and proceeded to get more and more angry.  All I wanted was a repour, of a simple drink, and did not want to start any drama.  Then the manager came out and claimed that we called the bartender was racist.  In a nutshell, it all got very odd, over dramatic and uncomfortable very quickly.  I will never come back here, simply because of how inappropriate the staff was over a simple request, and how they proceeded to make the situation a race thing.  Oh my, oh my.",

It took me a while to get in this place but when I finally got the chance to come I haven't stopped going back!! The service is always great here. Server menu knowledge is always on point and are always willing to give suggestions. Food is served on a large tray and everything can be shared, so I suggest you get a few different things, trust me there will be plenty of food! I started with the pineapple beer that they have on tap which I find pairs well with most dishes but I'm sure any of their options are great. I go for the collards which have jalapenos which gives it a nice but not over whelming kick. I have had both the Kim Chili Ramen Mac and the Ram N Cheese both are great cant go wrong with either! Now, the meat! I have had the kimchi pork spare ribs which were fall off the bone tender and juicy! I haven't had the chance to try the beef ribs but I'm sure they are phenomenal! I also had both flavors of wings (soy garlic, spicy BBQ), while both of these are undeniably delicious and  super crispy, I am sold on the spicy BBQ, sooo good! Now to my personal favorite the Kim Baps! sushi rolls (although they look very similar) don't have nothing on these babies! My favorite is the Fire Squid, these little suckers are bite size yet hold so much flavor! Absolute must have! I will be trying the beef rib nigiri kim bap next! I'm always full by the time dessert comes around but they do have dessert options. This place is just all around good! I have made it my personal mission to have every single thing on this menu and I cannot wait to go back! 10's across the board Seoul!!!!",

I do however wish they had additional sauces that weren't spicy. But the pork was amazing and the sauce it did come with was tasty, just a tad on the spicy side. The  sweet potato bird's nest was tasty! My husband enjoyed the loaded mashed potato salad. I can appreciate it's uniqueness but it wasn't my fave. Mostly because I don't care for cucumbers and it has their house pickled cucumbers in it and they were bigger chunks and I didn't care for the texture. But I wouldn't say it was bad.  As far as family friendly. Well not with smaller kids or picky kids. There is not a lot of selection of non spicy items. All the items are unique, which we enjoy trying new things but our 5yo was not so interested. Also, the TV's are playing some Asian pop music videos but they are pretty risque. So not so appropriate for a little one. I kept trying to avert his attention. That being said I would maybe come back I just wouldn't bring little ones.   What I really didn't like... The ramen and cheese. Yuck gag. It was horrible. Sorry, but I really hated it. Even the 5yo who loves Mac and cheese and any kind of noodles wasn't interested. Also, it was a little on the pricey side in general. ..  I would still recommend the place with no kids and no ramen.",

    "text": "Sorry, I believed the hype I read online but this place did NOT deliver on soooo many levels.  Their only vegetarian entree alternative is the tofu \"wings\".  Being that it's an Asian restaurant you would think they would know how to properly prepare tofu.  The huge 2\" cubes of tofu that came to the table were gelatinous, flavorless blobs.  Aside from the sauce they were dipped in, there was ZERO prep or attention paid to these.  The texture and consistency was nauseating.  I ate one half of ONE cube before realizing my meal was inedible.  I did order the Ramen Mac and Cheese (without the srirachi cracklings) and that was \"ok\", but nothing that would cause me to return here.  The spiral potato thing was decent.  Waitress asked what the problem was with my uneaten tofu and I told her in detail everything that was wrong with the dish.  She apologized and then promptly brought the bill and charged me for them.    Really?  Feel empowered to make it right in the eyes of me, your customer, and swallow the $0.99 (for a $9 dish) you have invested in these tofu hunks and make me want to give you another chance.  There's absolutely ZERO reason for me to return here.  The generic industrial-chic decor is a positive.  That and the spiral potato thing.  That's all.",

Called the restaurant up on Monday of that week, let them know we needed a big table and that I was in a power wheelchair and could use some extra room. They assured me it would be no problem and took the reservation. We got a phone call that Friday morning confirming our Booking.   Upon arrival, we were escorted to a private room; a perfect setting for the evening. Our waitress, Gabby, introduced herself, left menus and took our drink orders. Excellent selection of beers and speciality drinks. The first round, of many, arrived promptly and we started ordering from the $4 sides selections. Deviled, pickled eggs and Sirracha cracklings for the table got things started with unique tastes enjoyed by all. For our main courses, we ordered pork belly, wings, pulled pork barbecue, fire squid and a plethora of the sides. Everyone was given a paper plate and the main courses arrived on steel platters; perfect for passing around and sharing.   Gabby kept the drinks coming, the mgr stopped by to see how things were going and let us know the room was ours for as long as we wanted. Our group was from NJ, GA, TN and Charlotte (college friends together for the game) and enjoyed the meal and setting immensely.",

    "text": "So looks like most of the reviews are either hot or cold. This is my first time here and maybe I just came with the right people.   The wings were the best part - double fried Korean Style - the coatings were unreal and so crispy - the Soy Garlic and Spicy both kick butt - try them both! The Cracklins were good covered with the Sriracha/spice powder - the portion was huge and is plenty to share - they almost seem to magically refill themselves!! The last best thing was the fried tofu - nice firm texture and lots of flavor. The potato salad and the Ramen Mac and Cheese were nothing to write home about.  If you are a drinker - go all out and get the Coconut Soju - dude (or dudette) it's just not a party without that Soju - it will sneak up on you and kick your a$$. Warning - do not try to eat the coconut - not that I'd know anything about that (ahem).  I would definitely come back for the wings!",

All the food comes family style and the large plates of protein are big enough to share but if you get the rib get two you wont want to share it. We got the large brisket entree and the beef rib. The rib comes on the bone and fell right off,(we took the bone home for our pup and hes happy) the waitress tried to cut it but it pulled apart on it's own. The most tender meat I've ever had in my life. The brisket is nice and fatty with a good smoke and char and the rib has amazing charcoal flavor that  isnt too overbearing. We had the potato spiral and the spring rolls for our sides and they were both amazing and full of flavor. The waitress was very knowledgeable and super patient with us as it was our first visit. There are so many other things we want to try so we will definitely  be back. Amazing night!!",

You shouldn't have to wait around too long to find nearby parking, or at least I didn't have to.    Ambiance: I read plenty of reviews before going so I was pretty aware of what to expect given the Korean Southern fusion theme.  Fair amount of dine in seating  with one bar inside and an additional bar outside.  You must be okay with the loud bar feel!  It can get pretty loud inside!  Service: Everyone was really attentive and quick!  The hostess had a lot going on at the front, but managed it well.  ***They add you to a list if you need to wait and they will call two times before dropping you, so be sure to keep your phone full volume and on vibrate. ***  Food: I ordered the half and half soy garlic and spicy wings and fell in loooove with them. I love Korean chicken wings and these were the best by far. If you are a fan of Bonchon you will be even more in love with this place! They had a great crunch and were dressed well on the outside with juicy tender meat under the skin!  I also ordered the kimchi fries, which were also good! The kimchi had a great flavor!  I also ordered pork belly...which was amazing! Crunchy and the right amount of chewy fat.   All in all, great place and would recommend to anyone visiting Charlotte!",

I recently tried the green tea cornbread  (Im glad I did) it was soooo delicious.  I wouldnt have ever thought to put those two together. Kimbap (not sushi) is also a musy try. I enjoy the fire chicken with a side of fire sauce. I haven't had the opportunity to try the main dishes ,but its extremely hard to when their wings are so good.   Service - It tends to be a little slow at times yet the servers are still friendly and welcoming. This may come during their peak hrs. They are attentive and prompt when it comes to bringing out your food and making sure you have what you need.   Overall, I enjoy the atmosphere and food everytime I visit!",

    "text": "Yet another lackluster addition to Southend framed in a fun, millennial appealing atmosphere.   The silver lining for this place is their wings. As many others have said in their reviews, their wings are pretty damn good. If you skip out on the wings, you will probably be curious as to why this place is always packed (pro tip, get the Korean BBQ flavor).   The drinks...I ordered an old fashioned, which is pretty hard to mess up, but boy did they mess it up. After 10 minutes the waiter brings out what looks to be someone's drink that had 2 sips left, to which I asked \"is this someone else's drink?\". He laughed and replied with \"that's just how it comes\". $13 in the hole for this crap; I was not laughing. It was a watered down mess. I think a nun that's never had a sip of alcohol in her life could probably make a better one. The beer I ordered was also a joke, brought out in a 10oz plastic cup and charged $6 for. $20 later and didn't even have a buzz.   The rest of the food is certainly different and I think it just tries too hard. Their version of chili cheese fries are the kimchi fries. It's a muddled mess of flavor that doesn't mesh well with french fries. Their version of \"burgushi\" from Cowfish is not exciting at all. Bulgogi beef with no flavor that's wrapped in rice and kelp is just a terrible idea. If you have to put a warning on the menu about it \"not being sushi\", then it's probably indicative of something that's just a bad idea all around.   Seoul Food Meat Company looks like it should be a killer spot. Unfortunately I think the best thing about this place are the cornhole boards out back. Joining the likes of Zeppelin for crappy, overrated spots in Southend...2.5/5.",

Everything is super flavorful and the Korean and southern food twists make it a unique dining spot. Where else can you rent a karaoke room, play human pool, drink butter beer, and watch k-pop music videos while eating Mac n cheese ramen? You're right, no where else.  The service is great, the food is delicious, and the drinks are reasonable. Want more incentive? Read on   The soy garlic wings are the best wings I've ever had. They're huge, they're breaded/coated with something fantastic and crunchy, and the soy garlic sauce is out of this world. It's salty, it's sweet, but it's also light enough where it's not overpowering. Go ahead and try the other flavor...it's good. It's just not \"out of this world\" good. You don't regret the soy garlic wings.   Best food on the menu: Soy Garlic Wings, Ramen Mac n Cheese, Soy Deviled Eggs  Things that are ok (not bad, just not my faves): Potato Swirl, the \"other\" wings  Instagramable Drink: Any of the Soju in the fruit. The pineapple is my fave!",

However I felt the service/how they did things makes it a 4. I am by myself with my baby. Would have been nice if someone just came out to take my orders. We first came up to the front and was told, go to the back, put dog in play ground and then come to the bar and order your food, which I did. Then someone came out and told me my food was ready at the bar, went in and got it. Weird!!! FYI it was lunch time and not busy.   Food had good flavor, but cold. But maybe it sat at the bar!!!  -Pork belly barbecue had good flavors and the Barbecue sauce had a nice kick. -Sriracha cracklings were the bomb with large portion. we had the Sriracha powder seasoning on the side. -spicy wings: crispy and great sauce. -ramen Mac n cheese ok, ramen too soft, lack texture. -sweet potatoes bird nest. Thin and crispy, drizzled with light syrup. I put the Sriracha powder seasoning, which made it even better.  -spring rolls, had lots of fillings but too greasy and didn't have much flavor, very blah, had to drowned it in sauce.   I recommend this place. Good food with a twist makes me want to return and try other items.",

Although it's meant to be a blend between normal fried chicken and korean fried chicken, it was just not up to par with what I'm used to. The flavor was crispy and great on the outside but the actually chicken on the wings was bland leaving much to be expected.   I also got the kimchi fries and that was not bad but not necessarily blow my mind! I think if they included som bulgogi or a little bit more meat it would've made it amazing even if it meant charging a little bit more for it! I've had bulgogi fries before and they were amazing but this just wasn't up to par.  Service was great though and my waiter was super friendly and informative!   Parking wise you're gonna have to find  street parking which isn't too bad.   Overall, it's good but don't go with expectations of good korean fried chicken",

It was about 15 of us and they took us back to a room and were able to have fun with the karaoke as well as order food and drinks.  The staff was very patient and attentive due to the size of the party and the set up of people singing karaoke. I would definitely recommend renting a room for you and your friends. They have a good array of different songs. I had heard about their famous pineapple soju , so I decided to try that as well and I definitely wasn't disappointed. It came in a cute scooped out pineapple and a ladle so you can scoop it out in a shot glass for you or whoever your sharing it with.  Wings are always good Choice for food if you ever go too",

It's the whole beef rib so it has all the fat and bits you would expect. Just as appealing to eat as it is to look at.  The fire chicken was ok, spicy chicken with cheese, but the cheese was melted on with a blowtorch and unfortunately it left the cheese with a really strong propane flavor which honestly kind of ruined it for me.  Potato swirl was pretty good, hard to mess that one up IMO.   I honestly really enjoyed the beef rib and that plus the pretty extensive side menu would bring me back. The service was also really dope and our waiter gave us a bunch of suggestions of things to check out in the city while we were visiting.",

We were sat immediately. Deonte was our server and he was so well informed about the menu. We got the wings, spicy bbq and garlic soy. Garlic soy is better. Philly egg-rolls are good. We had the kimchi fries. Gotta get those. So many layers of flavors in one dish. I can't rave enough about this place. They have music and videos playing so it is a little loud, but I actually enjoyed watching another culture's music videos. The food is cheap. Go! Enjoy! I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "I really tried to keep an open mind about Seoul Food because my friends who I was visiting in the area was really excited to take me and my fiance there. Unfortunately, I've definitely had better Korean fusion food. I'm sure the competition isn't that big in Charlotte, but they may want to step up their game before things start blowing up there.   For our party of 5 we ordered: -beef ribs -crispy pork belly -soy garlic wings -spicy BBQ wings -bulgogi tacos -potato salad -kimchi fries -roast beef eggrolls  Sadly, nothing that we ordered wow'd me in originality, flavor, or presentation. There were 5 of us clearly sharing everything we ordered, and we also informed our server we'd be sharing everything, but for the fairly large amount of \"BBQ\" we ordered we had two 2oz cups of sauce for us to dip in. Maybe we could have asked for more if anyone bothered to ask if we needed anything, but our server wasn't really that attentive.   Beef ribs were okay. The seasoning wasn't that bad, but the overall taste was just displeasing---they didn't taste like they were smoked or prepared in any special way.   Crispy pork belly reminded me of heo quay (or lechon), but definitely not as well prepared and overpriced.   Soy garlic wings were tasty, but the wings were a bit dry.  Spicy BBQ wings legit taste like they just threw them in a bowl gochujang and nothing else---I mean I'm a fan of gochujang as the next person, but really? That's it?  The bulgogi tacos were amaaaaazingly greasy. We literally had a bowl full of grease leftover. Flavor wise it was okay. I've had better Korean tacos.  Potato salad was pretty bland, and wasn't the usual Korean potato salad I was expecting.    Kim chi fries were okay I guess. To be fair my standards for Kim chi fries are pretty high because of 'oh my gogi' in htx.  Roast beef eggrolls were interesting. It was like a crunchy mini roast beef sandwich with sauerkraut lol. Can't say that I've had the anywhere else.   Not only was the food mediocre it kind of seems like they don't really care about anyone's dietary preferences or allergens because my friend is lactose intolerant, and opting out of not having cheese on the kim chi fries was infeasible.  TLDR: -mediocre Korean fusion cuisine -limited parking in a small lot shared with 'Let's Meat' -unlikely to accommodate any dietary restrictions",

The wings, celebrated as the staple of the place, where double fried like they were supposed to be, but this crisp was stale and chewy .  To my surprise every patron was ordering and loving these wings..  to each his or her own.  The kimchi fries were excellent and the star of the show was the green tea ice cream biscuit.  I will leave it up to you to decide on this place but for me it's a One and Done.  I wish them well though.",

We ordered two different kinds of wings, the kimchi fries and pulled pork tacos. My favorite were the kimchi fries, you MUST try them. It is honestly such a great deal, because they are only $5 and piled with cheese, meat and awesome sauces! The wings were super crispy and the sauces were wonderful. The tacos were pretty good too!

We told our waiter to leave the menu as we were deciding on drinks when we initially ordered our food.  Well, the food started pouring out of the kitchen, still no drinks and no silverware or plates to eat the food. We didn't see our waiter again till the check came out. We flagged someone down and asked for silverware and plates. We had to make due with water since the waiter never came to take our alcoholic drink orders. The food was amazing but the service left a lot to be desired.",

    "text": "I have to give Seoul Food four stars because there is still meat to be tried and games to be played. But I do have to say - the experience that The Lady and I had here was north of 4 stars.  We arrived here on a Sunday night and were seated almost immediately. I do wish we could've sat outside, but we arrived probably about 45 seconds too early... but there were nice picnic tables in the patio out front.  Our server was quick to greet us, and we ended up trying a vegetarian meal - Fire Tuna Kim Bap (which is, as much as I still don't understand, is dissimilar to sushi), cold broccoli salad with sesame oil and gochujang sauce, the soy garlic tofu blocks (this was in the place of wings), and the potato swirl with a paprika and parmesan crust. I've never seen a potato preparation even close to this swirl, so that was a fun unique take on a potato chip. And the tofu was... well, it was tofu. But the sauce on it was stellar and I could tell that it would've translated beautifully to real wings.   Everything was stellar with great flavor, seasoning, and texture. However, \"Seoul Food Meat Company\" kind of implies that their meat is their specialty, and I didn't get any. Next time you best believe that I'm going to try ribs or hell I may even get a whole fish. The world is my oyster.  The atmosphere of the whole restaurant is really cool, and there's Korean music videos playing on the tvs. When we were there, I got to witness the greatness that was Korean hip hop. Y'all don't know great music videos until you've seen Korean hip hop.  Lastly, the patio out back looked incredible. And I've heard that they have an innovative game... soccer pool? What is this sorcery. A definite must visit when we get more time. Anyways, maybe I'll grab John H. soon and head there since The Lady doesn't have carnivorous habits...",

The rest of the menu is okay but doesn't have any stand out dishes.   The atmosphere is very cool, especially the back patio where there are yard games and a big outdoor bar. They have flavored beers like pineapple the are Saporo and pineapple juice - great combo.",

It's got great wings although there is a lot of batter on them. All the sauces are delicious though. The meats are all very good. The sides often have vinegar or soy, so I tend to stay away from most of the veggies. It's not a place to go if you're watching calories, as you'll definitely leave stuffed and salted. They have a wide variety of drinks, so it's great for beers or soju to try the local Korean drinks. If you are scheduling a bday dinner this place is perfect. Always a fun atmosphere and nice staff.",

We were the first to be served since we were the first to put in our order. Judging from the atmosphere when we were there, there might be a lot of bad reviews. Don't let them scare you away or else your taste buds will never know this unique...southern fusion?! (Is that a valid term for this?)  The lychee temple was sooooo good! You won't regret ordering it. It wasn't overly sweet either!  The Kim chi cole slaw and Bao buns are MUST HAVE side items. They really complete the meal with whatever meat you order. Ramen mac and cheese was interesting to eat. Make sure to eat it immediately otherwise the cheese will thicken to drying glue consistency.  Beef rib was so tender. It was cooked well; however, I was expecting more of a pronounced Korean twist to the flavor.  The crispy pork belly is...well.. crispy! Don't expect a braised pork consistency. This is your baked pork belly that's drier.  Fire chicken was good as well. It surprisingly had sprinkles of cheese on it.   The Korean fried chicken wings were the bomb dot com! They do take longer to come out than other foods. These were larger than your average wing. The breading is thicker than normal fried wings. They were crispy, juicy and evenly coated. I love how it's served with pickled radish to cut the grease (I think that's how the pairing usually is in Korea?)  FYI all the food is served on trays like a good ole southern BBQ joint. Gochujang sauce is served with your tray.",

I'm guessing and/hope they will twerk the menu a bit after they manage to sit down and take a breather! They are crazy busy! We ordered:  Pork Rib, soy garlic wings, crackling, Mac and cheese ramen, ban baos, sweet potato bird nest,  Spicy chicken and Pork belly  Drinks: lycee-itini and sparkling wine.  Pork rib was good. No special seasoning,  Soy garlic wings was awesome! Nice fried skins but taste like teriyaki wings. I love the crackling. Soo yummy.  Ban baos is like a bed of pure white gluten clouds. Soo a pillow like that it will help your meats sit nicely in there and oh so tasty!  Mac and cheese ramen. No, just no!!! Sweet potatoes bird nest was a hot mess. Some side were burnt some were not, tastes good on the NOT burnt side.  Spicy chicken is spicy! I couldn't mess with that  Pork Belly was juicy and and a perfect crunchy outer skin!  But the honorable mention along with the food is our waitress! Esther L. manage to be on point even though it's a mad house! Waits for table is 1.5 hrs. But Esther alway make sure our soda was filled and our drinks were never empty.. Most businesses doesn't realized this, but even if the food isn't good. Or it's lacking that day. It's the people like Esther that will get people like myself to come back and give the food another try!! And when it's bad service and the food is good. I will tell 10/20 people about the services and stay away for a long time.  I hope Seoul will incorporate more Korean speciality into their menu. I'm sure charlotteans are ready for these type!",

The pulled pork is my favorite entree item!  Along with an order or two of the bao buns (which are bread only, nothing inside) it makes for a whole meal.    The beef rib isn't rendered enough so it was very chewy and hard to break apart.  The Brunswick stew is a little soupy.  I wasn't crazy about the tacos but the pulgogi was my favorite.

Their wings are extra crispy without being overly battered and come with just enough flavors of soy to bring out the umami. The BBQ sauce has hints of oyster sauce, and as with many Korean restaurants, kimchi and other pickled vegetables come as accouterments to most dishes. There is a serve yourself bloody mary bar on Sundays with more mixers and pickles. Especially lively when the game is on.  Attentive staff, great happy hour deals, everything I ordered was tasty.",

    "text": "The other night I had dinner at Seoul Food Meat Co. while visiting Charlotte.  It's nestled in a cute part of town where you'll find a couple of Growlers, a cafe, and some cool looking townhomes.  This area reminded me a lot of a cool part of town in Atlanta.  Super clean and Seoul Food Meat Co's restaurant just shined bright with its white brick building with clean simple lettering on the wall and black framed large window.  Before I entered the restaurant I was pleased to see they had a cool and pretty spacious gated patio and after I learned it was a pet friendly patio, I was elated.  I made a mental note to bring my furbaby with me the next time I'm in town.  Once I entered the restaurant I immediately thought to myself \"oh wow, what a cool spot!\"  Loved the industrial & rustic style and feel of this restaurant.  Very inviting and notches that the place was packed even for a weeknight.  Everyone looked like they were having a good time.  They played Korean pop and had a bunch of flat screens to keep all entertained.  The bar area is pretty cool looking too.  They have a neat wall to the side of the bar filled with colorful bottles.  Thought it was cool to see the view behind the wall was a big window that brought in some good light.  Felt like a cool backdrop  The entire restaurant was very organized and well put together.  After dining here I kept thinking a restaurant like this would kill it in Atlanta.  They should open up a location there.  Seriously.    We were immediately greeted by our servers who were super friendly and helpful throughout our entire dining experience.  They were prompt from start to finish.  Our drinks came out pretty fast.  I had a chance to try the watermelon beer, lychee lemonade (non-alcoholic), and also had some of their watermelon soju.  I enjoyed all three.  Very refreshing for the hot summer heat.  It's cool how they had the watermelon soju inside an actual half of a watermelon.  Loved that!    A couple of things I noticed after looking over the menu -like how they have a wide array of side items.  I mean a good variety of them.  (I heart sides) -clean and simple menu -had a good amount of protein items including a fish  Now on to the food.  Our group had the following: -chicken wings- ordered the both sweet one (soy garlic) and spicy & sweet one (spicy BBQ).  Enjoyed them both that we ordered a second round for our group.  Packed with flavor and perfectly fried with a nice cool she'll.  I hear they use rice oil for their chicken wings which is a plus.  Loved how the wing and drumsticks were huge. -soy pickled boiled eggs- yum!  Heard they pickle their own veggies.  This was one of the fav amongst our picky group -Korean slaw- nice sweet & spicy dressing.  Cool Korean twist to the good ole Cole slaw I'm used to.  -ramen mac & cheese- this was unique.  Never had this style before but felt worked with the fusion style restaurant they are.  Definitely recommend eating this as soon as it comes out.   -kimchee Brunswick stew-  good and had layered flavors.  Liked their take on the Brunswick stew.  Very clean tasting with just the right about of seasoning.  They loaded it up with yummy meat and veggies that go in a Brunswick stew - fresh pickled slices- so light, fresh, and tasty.  I could've eaten like a fistful of these.  Wish there were more. -beef ribs-  WOW!  I mean really wow!  Great flavor and cooked to perfection.  It literally fell off the bone.  Topping it with their secret special sauce was like the perfect combo.  Seriously this one is so good! -crispy pork belly- another yummy item!!  I think my bf at like half of them himself.  Cooked so well.  Very nice crispy outside with perfect texture inside.  I've had a lot this style in ATL but Seoul Food did it right. -dirty rice- this one was good too.  Don't know what they topped it with but that compilation added a very nice flavor to each bite of my rice.  Wish I had more of that topping.  -pulled pork- it was good.  Definitely liked it with the BBQ sauce that came with it. -fire chicken-  really enjoyed this one.  Topped with some yumminess and the chicken was nice and moist. A good counter protein from the meat. -buns- would definitely the bao buns with your dinner.  Super soft but a nice casing for the proteins and sides.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.  It is a great representation of how to get Charlotte on the foodie scene.  Love seeing how the people of Charlotte have embraced this new gem of a place from what I observed.  I guess I was amongst some cool C-Town foodies.  Seoul Food Meat Co is innovative and creates a cool atmosphere for those looking to have dinner with friends, family, or coworkers.  This is an establishment that serves some good fusion food that scream a labor of love.  Those going in with an open mind and open palate will be pleasantly surprised that this is a forward thinking fusion hub.  Keep up the good work and I'm definitely coming back here when I'm in town.",

Their drink selection is also unique and probably the only time I'll enjoy drinking because it all tastes so good. The watermelon soju and lycee soju are some of my favorite and can be shared. I've tried most of their meats and you can't really go wrong with the exception of the kimchi pork.   Service is amazing as well. Last time I came here was with a big party. The service was exceptional despite being a large party. Drinks were always filled and the server came by frequently to see if we needed more drinks or food. Really glad I came with a large party because I finally got to try sides that I have yet to try and they did not disappoint! There is one server in particular that gives the best service I have ever had. He works pretty much every time I go there. Will note his name next time I see him.",

I recommend trying the wings (half & half meaning half soy ginger/half spicy), Mac & cheese ramen as well as the broccoli salad. If you prefer a meatless meal, tofu wings are an option or if you prefer fish I definitely recommend trying. My only minor complaint is service can be slow however the quality/atmosphere definitely makes up for it.",

I came here with a few friends a while ago and I've gotta say: i have never been to a restaurant like this before. Southern bbq+Korean twist? Love it.  They have fruit soju in fruits! We tried the pineapple and coconut soju. Coconut was my favorite. It wasn't too sweet and didnt have too strong an alcohol flavor. So delicious!  I think my group got several things: The fried tilapia. I was not expecting them to bring out a whole fried tilapia. It looked kind of grotesque when i saw it at first, to be honest but my, oh my did it make my taste buds scream for joy. Fried to perfection! The outside is nice and crispy while the inside is moist and delicious.   The crispy pork belly is also so on point. The skin is suuuper crispy and not at all soggy. It's a little fatty but I like it that way.  Ramen mac and cheese? Can't go wrong with that. It was yummy.   Don't forget to get the bao buns. They may not seem that appealing cos it's just buns but just you wait until you put some meat up in there.   Now when all of this comes to you it may not look like a lot of food, but believe me-- it is. The servings are small, but it's enough to fill you up so don't be mistaken.   Last but not least the service was fantastic! I wish every dining experience that I had went a little something like this. There wasn't once when our water/soda cups were empty. Our server Sarah constantly checked up on us and made sure we were happy. Fast and friendly is all i could ask for and Seoul Food Meat Co gave me that and so much more.",

The food can be family style or single (but family is more what it's meant for). We ordered the fire chicken, fried pork belly, and half/half of the wings for our entree and pimento corn, kimchi slaw, and a spiraled potato as sides. All of which were VERY good. At the end of the night we did agree that all the entrees we're worth ordering again and the spiraled potato. Definitely will be coming back to try the rest of the menu. The ambience is nice, and there is K-pop music and videos. The wait staff was very helpful, kind, and timely.",

She was VERY informative & answered all of our questions! We also got drinks which unfortunately was the reason our evening wasn't so great. My boyfriend had a fly in his drink, which obviously is not fun! We showed it to the waitress and she took it and got him another drink. The food was a little cold but it had TONS of flavor! Wasn't a huge fan of the taco but the potato roll was one of the best things I've ever had... just wish it had been warmer! Cool thing about this place is as you order it comes out. So food is always on its way! The wings were great. The soy garlic is what I would recommend. They were cooked amazingly! At the end of our evening, the check came and unfortunately they did not take the drink that had a fly in it off of the ticket. I went up to the counter and the waitress was SO kind and refunded it to me which was also kind. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a funky place to try new things!",

As far as things to do, they have amazing outdoor games including giant jenga, connect four, washers, beer pong, corn hole, and life size soccer pool which is always a blast. Even better they have a dog playground that is off to the side, so dog lovers can enjoy seeing the pups play while non dog lovers don't have to worry about it. Great for groups or just two people to hang out and stay busy. There usually isn't a long wait to play any of the games.   As far as food, the pork belly will actually melt in your mouth. The pulled pork is the boyfriends favorite. The steamed buns I could do without, but the sweet potato bird nest is a must order. I've sampled all of their tacos and have never been disappointed. The Rahmen with cheese is also a must have, get the pork cracklings on top.   They have a large beer and drink selection. Full bar plus they carry several local breweries on tap. In addition they also have fun drinks you can order in fruit. If you are looking for somewhere to eat, have fun, and relax with friends this is your place.   As a warning, it will be busier on week nights, so be prepared to wait a little longer. During the week you can have the whole back patio to yourself. They also have rooms that you can rent out per hour for Karaoke.",

The reason they get 3 stars is bc from the second we stepped in the service was terrible! We had a 3 year old with a \"outside\" drink and was told she couldn't have it, and taking it away made her scream...but they didn't care. Then we were told that we couldn't smoke a low vapor Juul OUTSIDE. We had no forks to eat our food and had to flag someone down after several minutes of our server not attending us and the server also forgot one beer and took 5 mins to bring it to us after everyone else's. The bathroom was on a cleaning break for \"5 minutes\" as per the sign and again we had a 3 year old that can't wait...right at 6pm. Overall food is GREAT, but it's a shame bc the service is TERRIBLE!",

We arrived late in the evening, and there was still a fairly good sided crowd, however we were able to get a table right away. It should be noted that apparently two of the more popular items on the menu were out, so if you're desire is the pork belly or sweet potato come earlier in the evening.   Our waiter was quick and friendly, his advice surely didn't steer us wrong.   Overall I'd give it a 5 star rating, and maybe it's not fair but while the fusion of the two food styles were tasty, I wasn't blown away, so I have to be honest with the 4 stars. I'm more interested in going back to try out all the beers on the drink menu.",

They tell you right at the front entrance \"This isn't your typical Korean restaurant\" what they mean is their dishes fuse traditional Korean specialties with your classic American BBQ dishes.

So far my experience with the menu can best be described as 80/20.  80% of the things i've ordered were really good...the other 20, i will pass on in the future!   Best items: 1. Soy Ginger Wings (the other flavors were ok, but this is by far the best) 2. The Brisket taco (probably the tastiest item on the menu) 3. Fire Chicken (tip, order the sticky bun side to put the fire chicken in!) 4. Pimento Cheese Dip 5. Deviled Eggs 6. Pumpkin Beer!!!!  Ok Items, but not the best 1.  Ramen mac n cheese (i was just hopping it would be better.) 2.  Kimchi Pork Taco (not bad, but not the brisket)  Items i will pass on: 1: Potato Salad (just didn't do it for me. Very bland) 2.

    "text": "Seoul Food puts a mouth-watering spin on two totally different food cultures, Korean and American Southern, and pulls off an affordable high-concept restaurant that is perfect for date night, groups, vegetarians and hard-to-please food geeks.  The atmosphere was hip and the service impeccable; my late October visit was made even better relaxing outside on their picnic tables. Not packed on a Monday night, dinner here was the perfect follow-up to flight night across the street at Craft. The wings were much larger than expected, due in part to the generous crispy exterior and splitting the order between the spicy and soy garlic provided some nice balance and taste variety. Crispy pork belly was no joke and the pimento corn cheese had a great combination with the puffy chips and cool, smooth dip.  The casual nature and brown paper presentation of some of the dishes is a nice contrast to the obvious care and attention paid to food, drinks and the overall experience. There are plenty of great dining experiences of all types around Charlotte and Seoul Food is right there at the top for fans of South End.",

I had lychee soju and melon soju (comes in an actual melon!)) and both were so delicious, I'm craving some right now.  Pretty hip atmosphere and good vibes.  Highly recommend.  I'm going here everytime I visit Charlotte!",

Long version: Service was nice and friendly but understaffed so you may need to ask a couple times to get things.  Despite this the food came out fast and was great.  The food is served family style so I would suggest going with a large group so you can trying more of their dishes.  We got the beef rib, both kinds of chicken wings, pork belly, tilapia, mac n cheese ramen and potato crisps.  The beef rib was good, I would recommend eating it with the sauce they serve with it.  It gives the meat a lot of flavor and makes everything moist.  I suggest eating it on their buns, making you own slider.   The chicken wings were very crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside but a little greasy with the rice oil they use to cook them in.  While I didn't like the pork belly too much my family all enjoyed the crunchiness of the pork belly and the dipping sauce they provide.  The  tilapia was my favorite dish, the sauce they put on it is amazing.  As for the sides the mac n cheese ramen is great if you are looking for comfort food but potato crisps have great flavor and I would highly recommend them as well.",

I did not enjoy the atmosphere because I could not hear my companion across the table.  To say it was loud would not even begin to do it justice. It was obnoxiously loud.  No one's fault, just how it's constructed. Our server was outstanding and while it took forever to get our food, again we were not surprised because it was very crowded. The parking was awful as you'd expect in that area. So some good, some bad...But did I mention the wings?",

TRY their beef ribs, the sweet sauce it comes with I can drink straight out of pan. The beef rib is MOIST, you know you love that word and completely fall off the bone.  The atmosphere is great with a fun back patio and very friendly staff. Just note for any Koreans, they don't speak Korean.. I tried once and all I got was a \"bow\" every time they saw me lol!  Their \"KFC\" or korean fried chicken is amazing, better then BONCHON that opened recently for KFC. Very Crispy and light between their yangyam spicy sauce and their sweet soy honey based sauce.  Their Kimbap roll is very flavorful especially the bull go gi Kimbap! If they can somehow incorporate some grill off the table for korean bbq, that be a great idea too!  Anyhow, I would just come here for the wings and drinks alone all summer long!",

The waitstaff was able to seat us in a timely manner and were super nice and easy going when it came to such a big group.  This place is more of a family style ordering, so I jumped in to order with 2 other people.  We ordered the rib which is huge and amazing.  You must try!  We also go the chicken wings which were delicious too.  The sides we tried were the mac and cheese, salad, potatoes, and broccoli.  All of the sides were delicious too. Additionally, their alcohol selection has a variety and includes Asian drinks too.  Seoul is a must visit place if you're ever in Charlotte!  The atmosphere, staff, and food are top notch!  I've been a couple other times with friends and always have a great experience. I wanted to add that the wings, sweet potatoes, and tacos are some of my favs.  I did not like the tuna (not) sushi, because they use tuna salad instead of real tuna.  Their fruit beers are light, delicious, and refreshing!",

I ordered the half and half wings, half of which were awful. The ramen Mac n cheese wasn't cheesy and the noodles were over cooked. Our server Vivian was attentive and efficient.

As a good Yelper would do  I fired up my Yelp app and read the reviews and some entree suggestions. After perusing the menu and consulting with my fellow Yelpers suggestions, I settled on the pulled pork, bao buns, collard greens and the spiral potatoes. Everything was good. The pulled pork came in a mound of meat, yep that's right, it literally was a mound of meat and it was drizzled in a homemade \"bbq sauce\" which has a little kick to it. The spiral potatoes are good and the seasoning they are dusted in also has a little kick to it. Now I'm from the south and southerners love our greens especially our collards. I was a little skeptical about eating collard greens in a Korean restaurant but I said what the hell, you only live once, and I tried them. They were pretty good and well seasoned. The bao buns were warm and delicious. Overall its plenty of food and even if you get the smaller portion, its enouhh to share.  One other important thing, they have a lot of beers, cider and cocktails. Not sure what you want to dri k, you can ask for a sample of the beer or cider youre pondering.  I'm not ruling out coming back and next time I'll get the ginger soy wings with spiral potatoes.",

Well, the bf decided to hit up Seoul Food after my class ended early yesterday and boy were we glad he did. Outside seating was basically full so we opted to sit at the bar. The bartender was super helpful and explained everything just perfectly.   I wasn't that hungry so we opted  to share a small fire chicken (about half a pound) with a ram n cheese and bao bun sides (sides are $4 each). Food came out quick. I LOVE THE CHICKEN!!! That was the juiciest chicken I've had in a long time.. The spicy sauce was a good add-on, glad I had some to take home. The bao buns were a good call, make your own sandwiches. Loved this part. I had to dock half a star because the ram n' cheese was super dry...It was a valiant effort in theory, but execution wasn't all there today. Be generous with the cheese sauce, it will only help. And some sambal could be a cool fusion add in.   We will definitely be back for more, hopefully it was an off day for the ram n cheese because its such a good idea!",

Very social vibe out back on the patio with a ton of adult games. Also they have private karaoke rooms you can rent out for an hourly charge which is a cool touch.  I've had the wings, pulled pork, potato swirl (comes w/ two delicious sauces), the ramen mac and cheese and the beef rib. ALL great.  Try the Soju! It's a korean drink that tastes delicious. I like the yogurt. Comes with dry ice in the bottom so it's fun to share and very refreshing.  Only slight critique I have is the BBQ sauce has soy sauce in it, making it very salty. So use with caution or don't use at all (unless you love soy sauce on your BBQ). -- Still 5 stars for me, because that is the theme for the restaurant being it an asian southern fusion.",

It was a nice night, so the garage door was open, giving us a nice breeze and feel like we were kinda outside some. It's a fairly small spot but there seemed to be a decent amount of tables inside, along with a bar that had indoor and outdoor seating at the bar.  For a drink, I went with the white wine cocktail (mainly cause someone else ordered it and I just didn't want to make a decision of choosing off their decent drink list). My husband got the yogurt soju, at the recommendation of our waitress. As we were soju virgins, we didn't exactly know what to expect. Guys, this drink was amazing!! It came out smoking in a cocktail shaker and they give you a few shot glasses to drink it out of. Next time I want to try the watermelon or pineapple soju, as I heard they serve it literally out of the fruit. The sojus are totally worth the money!  My husband and I ordered the 6 wings (half and half for sauces), the pork belly, the pimento corn cheese and the potato swirl. Our meal came out on a metal tray.....perfect for sharing, which is great for a date night or in a big group. Our group passed around items as well, so I got to try a few more foods. The pork belly was spot on delish and well cooked. The potato swirl was a highlight. I think it had something to do with the seasoning. The wings were super large sized....aka, order less than you can eat of normal wings. I liked both the sauces and would definitely recommend the half and half.  Service was excellent. Great new spot and we will definitely be back!",

Let's start with the entertainment- there are karaoke rooms for rent, there is an amazing patio space with soccer pool (Google it), beer pong, cornhole, and a full dog run space. On the inside there was a Bloody Mary and Mimosa bar set up!  I am a vegetarian and there were a ton of options for me. My boyfriend ordered the wings and pork belly. I was impressed that the spiked seltzer waters were on the menu! Overall the food was awesome. So original and perfect for the Southend vibe.",

If it wasn't against my moral compass, I would get a tattoo of \"Seoul Food Meat Co.\" on my chest, slightly below my heart. Now that I got that out of the way, Seoul Food Meat Co. is not your typical Korean restaurant - it is much, much more! It is a hybrid of southern BBQ with a Korean twang and the flavors are amazing. I had the wings and they are nothing short of incredible. They were literally straight fire. Seriously if you aren't into spicy foods, I recommend you proceed with caution. I chose the \"soy garlic\" flavor - I would bet that Colonel Sanders would even say they are finger-lickin' good!  The sides I chose were potato swirl and ramen mac & cheese. The potato swirl seasoning had a ton of flavor. The ramen mac & cheese was cheesier than a dad joke and the ramen base made me question why I hadn't thought of it before. The atmosphere felt modern, lively, and open but not crowded. The beer selection is interesting and I must confess that, even though I am a male, I indulged in the pineapple beer, which was surprisingly delicious!  Service is a big deal to me, but since it was so great, I don't know how it could be any better. Perhaps mind reading? In summary, I will be back.  If anyone from Seoul Food Meat Co. is reading this, you can be sure I will be an honorary ambassador for eternity.  I wish you the best and thank you for feeding my Seoul!",

We sat at the bar while we were waiting on our table and even though the bartenders were not busy, we waited for 10 minutes to get a drink (while others who just arrived were served), and had to go to management to simply get a drink. In addition, bar area was dirty with left over glasses (not ours), and a lot of crumbs. We asked the bar tender to please clean where we were sitting, and he gave us an aggressive look and said \"when i get to it\" - he never did. A group of girls came to the bar after us, and automatically were attended to. There were two white males next to us that also were ignored. I finally asked to talk to a manager. She got our drinks and apologized and i thought she would ensure we had a positive experience from then on, but it became obvious quickly that they wanted to ensure we had a negative experience (the management and bartenders we encountered we quite passive aggresssive). I thought the worst was over, but NO! We were then sat at a table that no one had been sat at the entire evening (in the servers station area). We then asked for another table and they said they would put us back on the waiting list. After waiting another 15 minutes, we decided to leave. As we were leaving, we saw others that had just arrived being escorted to their tables. We told the host to take us off the list, and he sarcasctically replied \"ok, sure\". If you appreciate decency and ethics, DO NOT go to Seoul!!",

We ordered a wide variety of items - mac n' cheese ramen, fire chicken (just alright), brisket, beef ribs, potato swirl, spicy wings, soy garlic wings (my favorite out of everything!), plus margaritas, soju, and beers.

You seriously MUST order the wings - they are the crispiest, juiciest, most flavorful wings I've ever tasted - and I'm not even a wing-lover. Our crew of 4 ordered 10 wings as an app before chowing down on a ridiculous platter of more meat and sides... and it was incredible.   For dinner, we split two half-options of the brisket and pork belly along with 3 sides. The boys ordered the butter beers (heavenly - a must try for HP fans), and the girls ordered the house margarita (happy median between sweet and sour, with a surprise coffee-tasting \"drip\" of sorts on the side - random, but it worked!). Needless to say we rolled out with very happy bellies.   The atmosphere is very casual. Food is served in recyclable (I assume) baskets, which I find kind of strange - is there a reason that real dishes aren't used? Seems like a lot of waste. Aside from that, though, the atmosphere is vibrant and fun, and we also discovered the karaoke rooms in the back hallway heading toward the outdoor patio. We didn't get the chance to step inside, but it looked like people were having a blast. Great spot for a birthday celebration or just a fun night singing wirh your crew.",

    "text": "I'm going to start this off with pointing out it was my mistake, the pescatarian, picking a meat company restaurant for dinner. When I initially looked at the menu, I saw that they had tofu wings, so I got excited and there are usually several fish options, so I figured I would be good. Unfortunately, that was not necessarily the case. There were fish options but not many... the tilapia was spicy and the wrap they said was tuna salad which isn't exciting. I figured I'd just go the route of a side of veggies or two. Usually this isn't the issue except all of their veggie sides were spicy and I am not a huge spice fan. I also considered the tofu wings but they only had 2 kinds of sauce - spicy and soy garlic.   I just felt that my choices were very limited - and I get it! I went to a restaurant that has \"meat\" in the name so for a part of it, I can really only blame myself. I gave 3 stars just because even if I did eat meat, the sides were limiting to carbs or spicy food and not much in-between.   On the other hand LOVED the watermelon beer! It was beautiful, refreshing, and very tasty. I am not sure exactly how they made it but it tasted like fresh pressed watermelon juice mixed with some kind of ale. It was perfect.",

We sit down to be given a list of warnings, \"These are small plates, so they come out when they come out\" Great, not our first small plate rodeo we will order a sampling of everything and see what we like, not in a hurry. We order the fire chicken \"Warning this is Very Spicy!\" Great, we love spice. \"The food isn't traditional Korean\" wouldn't have thought otherwise, ramen mac and cheese is on the menu, we are open minded and like new good food. Let's roll.  Everything comes out at once, there goes casual small plates.  Everything comes out luke-warm or cold.  We eat quickly as everything is already at a pretty meh temp and we have a pile of food all fading fast in front of us.  The fire chicken, absolutely not spicy.  The fire chicken, an ill-conceived abomination, a half pound of completely un-melted cold cheese on top of some fine BBQ chicken. (I am a cheesehead, this was gross by the standards of a culture that would eat a block of cheddar like an apple) It was actually nauseating.  The ramen mac and cheese, a pan simmered block of ramen with a thick layer of cheese sitting on top, one note, failing to deliver either a good mac and cheese, or a good ramen dish. The culinary achievement of many a stoned college student on a hot-plate.   Everything was missing an acid, or heat, or anything to balance the one-note flavor, which was mostly salt and cheese and a South meets East fusion that clashed clumsily at every union.   +1 star for generous brisket portion which tasted fine and some actually good wings.  Problem is there are a lot of good or better brisket and wing spots nearby. I think the concept of BBQ American fusion is potentially sound, the execution isn't.",

After we said no (because it's 50 degrees) she pushed twice saying there were heaters.  We weren't offered a wait time for inside or another solution.  Unfortunately, we had to leave.",

The Cole slaw was ok at first bite. After 3 bites I couldn't eat anymore, something about the flavor was not appetizing. The first wing was good, but time I made it to the second I realized I couldn't eat anymore. Between that and the deviled eggs it was so salty I couldn't take it. I had 3 glasses of water while I was there and I just could not quench my thirst or get the flavors out of my mouth. My boyfriend got the fire chicken and the cracklins -he said they were \"ok\". The atmosphere was fun, a little loud, and the drinks were good too. Servers were nice. I wish I liked the food more. :(",

I've been a couple of times since but my experience today will cause me never to go again. A friend of mine who had never been before ordered the hot wings and complained that they didn't taste right and were overcooked. We spoke to the manager and expected to at least have that portion of our meal comped. Instead the manager on call made a very flippant remark of will you bought it you ordered it you bought it and just kind of walked away.  I've never had such horrible customer service and just really a disrespect for the customer.  Clearly they are only interested in folks were 25 years old and are too drunk to notice that they're not getting a customer service. Even on the way out he made a remark of \"come again\", which quite frankly was just not necessary.  So if you're looking for the manager in question he's the heavyset Asian guy.  I would not recommend anybody to go there because they don't care about treating you well as long as they have bodies in the seat and people ordering drinks. You have been warned.",

I tend to go with a large group as we work late at times and it's nice that my team gets to share a meal and have some fun. Today was my fourth visit in the past month and every time we go we drop at least $300-400 and overtip our waiter (Kevin, who is awesome). We went tonight with a party of 9 and was joking with the waitress (Victoria) that it was the second time they were out of young coconut for their coconut soju and we really like them. We ordered 4 tonight. She came back with only 2 and the other 2 were in shakers and said that we were to be charged $15 for them. We told her that when we were there previously with Kevin, we were only charged for $10. Somehow awhile later the General Manager came and asked us why we were giving Victoria a hard time, which we weren't. We just said we were previously charged for them at $10. He went on to say that it could not be True and we must have remembered it wrong because they don't have that price point and that we were being confrontational and he will leave us to it. Wow! I am floored at the lack of professionalism in food service even after we said it was fine to charge us the $15. We were insulted and the General Manager, David, can use some education in servicing paying customers. I did speak with Victoria when I paid the bill to make sure she understands that we were not giving her a hard time and she totally gets it. David was rude and has lost the business of our team at dine-ins, team events, and take out. Too bad you are losing customers this way.",

    "text": "I will put this down as my favorite Asian restaurant thus far in Charlotte.  It is fusion, not Korean as the name \"Seoul food\" might suggest, but the flavors are balanced and on point for each item I tried, both for Korean and the Chinese flavors. And I am very picky about my Asian food across the board.   The Korean beef ribs are an excellent take on Kalbi Jjim ( ), not Regular Kalbi (which is what most Korean places serve), which I happen to love. Meat is fork tender.  The pork belly is Chinese style with super crisp fatty side (almost like chicharones) and super delicious with a side of Bao (the Chinese buns).  Bonchon style fried chicken would definitely hold its own against original Bonchon chain. My favorite is the soy ginger flavor. Fried, yet not greasy at all, because of the special process.   Free tiny sides with the meat include the sweet radish cubes (the kind you get at Bonchon) and Korean style pickle slices.   The sides I purchased included kimchi slaw (it's not kimchi, its not fermented. it's a spicy slaw with definite strong Spicy flavor which evokes Korean) which was refreshing and definitely in the Cole slaw family and shouldn't scare anybody off.  Sadly the ramen mac & cheese is not yet available on the menu, because I really wanted to try it (slowly expanding the menu I think, and the place has been only open 6 days since their soft opening).  I took mine to go, waited maybe 10-15 minutes because didn't call ahead. but hanging out waiting for my order, the interior was nice, kind of a reminiscent of a Bonchon but bigger bar. TVs showing Korean music videos and the like, very modern and cool vibe. Well lit. Plenty of parking in back. Owner was super nice.   I'd go here if they only had the Bonchon style double fried crispy non greasy wings. They're super popular in New York and California, and it's great that Charlotte finally has them.",

The sauce on the chicken was incredible. The sauce on the side not only was very hot but had great flavor. Amazing!  The ramen mac was good. Sure it may be improved but overall, very nice.  The service was impeccable. The stars was attentive but not too attentive. Service was quick. The food came out fast.

Also had a couple of fat brisket tacos which were the ABSOLUTE BEST! Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Korean food with some Seoul. The wife and I will surely be back on our next trip to Charlotte",

We popped over to Seoul after a work meeting to get some grub and a beer after hearing over and over again how cool it was.  First thing, this place is dog friendly - if I could give them an extra star for that I would.  The outside area is large and spacious and perfect for groups.  The vibe is exactly what you hope for - industrial, unique and eclectic enough to make you feel cooler than you actually are.  My recommendation for the food?  Look through yelp photos!  I was really excited for the Ramen Mac, but ended up being WAY more impressed with the Pimento Nachos.  The wings were really good, but they were fried - which is not what I was expecting.  The Bao Buns don't come with meat inside so we stuffed some pork belly in there and it was awesome.  Next time I want to try the green tea biscuits for sure.   The service was positive, the food was fun and delicious, the weather was beautiful... I wish I was still there.  Probably not an ideal place for vegetarians - if you couldn't tell from the name alone.... that said there is actually a small selection of non-meat items that are really good!",

The cocktail and drink list is really creative and fun and they have a broad selection.  There were 3 of us and we got: Pulled pork (small) - DELICIOUS!!! Fire chicken (small) - really good Half and half wings  (large)- they are SO crispy and the sauces are delicious, a little on the sweet side, but I have never had better tasting wings in my life Buns- the best!! Ramen Mac and cheese- cool concept, really different, wasn't a huge fan but it was still good The fried potato skewer- this was so different and SO good!  This is such a fun and different place that has incredible food! This was one of the most memorable dining experiences I've ever had and I can't wait to go back. All of the employees were very friendly as well and the restaurant itself is gorgeous!",

    "text": "Good food and excellent service!   Lots of hits and misses on the menu but despite some so-so menu items, 5 stars for the wings and service. Ask for Vivian. She's awesome!   For S&G, get a beer tower. It's pretty cool. And don't forget to check out the out the outdoor patio! There's a dog park, some cool beer pong setups, and other goodies.  Wings here are super crispy, with a super savory thick crust. It doesn't sound very appealing until you take a bite. You'll be hooked for sure! Despite there being 3 options, there are only 2 flavors: soy garlic & spicy garlic. Half & half is simply half order of soy garlic and half order of the spicy. Both flavors are delicious, but one is usually better than the other depending on the night. I find the flavors inconsistent every time I dine here. Regardless, it's always good. Wings are a must try for sure!  Every wing dish comes with a small serving of pickled radish. It's not for everyone but I highly recommend tasting it with the wings. It brings in a nice, sweet tangy crunch to the wings.   To make the wings next level:  Get a side of Ramen Cheese. Comes with little crispy bits on it. Excellent. It's the ultimate cheesy compliment to the savory wings. Try them together. It's so good! Top it off with a beer and you're good to go.   On occasion, pairing the wings and ramen cheese with the sojus is also good. Both the lychee and coconut soju are tasty. Lychee leans a little sweet, and tangy. Very refreshing!    Other things to try, though less urgently:   Crispy Pork Belly: Typical crispy pork belly. So good and hard to mess up. They make it reallllyyy crispy here (yum) plus a nice meat to skin ratio. (Other place love to skimp on the meat). The meat is also very juicy here but borderline oily at times. Still a delicious treat.  If you want to bring it to the next level: Order a side of bao buns, and get some of those pickled cucumbers. Put that all together and drag it through the dregs on the soy garlic sauce. It's heavenly. Finish off with beer. (Disclaimer: Pork belly is quite overpriced here. You can go a mom and pop asian shop and get way more for cheaper.)  Pimento Cheese Dip: the chips add a cool spin to the dip. it's a cold dip.  it doesn't come out hot. you'll like this if you enjoy pimento cheese/ non sharp cheese. the novelty did wear off as I ate though and got distracted by other food (namely wings and pork belly) but definitely a great appetizer type dish. eat the chips touching the dip first as these types of chips tend to turn soggy quickly  Blueberry beer. It's damn good.   Things to Pass On: Beef Rib: comes with a giant bone in the middle and vinegar based dipping sauce. didn't seem like a lot of meat for the money plus the meat was dry pretty much everywhere except for where there was fat  Kimchi Pork...meat wasn't really tender and the kimchi flavoring didn't really do much for me. there was hardly any kimchi in the dish and it was cooked in so you miss that nice little sour bite that's characteristic of kimchi. feels like they're going for savory but missed the mark and landed somewhere in messed up burnt siracha flavor land  Kim Chili Ramen: oi. basically chili with ramen noodles buried underneath. there was no taste of kimchi at all (like the pork, it was cooked out completely). an absolute pass, unless you're a die hard chili fan...then you do you.  Soy Deviled Eggs: horribly dry with a pickled flavor. a huge miss. maybe if you're a fan of dried pickled eggs but hard pass for me",

We sat down at the bar and were extremely excited to see some amazing craft beers. We hit up the grapefruit shandy and blueberry lager. Thank goodness they had more than just IPAs.  What was even more exciting was the food menu and all the delicious combos we could create. We settled on the small plate of the pulled pork BBQ and spicy smoked chicken ($9 each), two orders of the bao buns and the Raeman Mac N' Cheese.   When the food came out there were two huge lumps of mouth watering meats, steamed buns, sides of both sauces and the Raeman. From the time the food came out until the time we got our bill, we were trying to figure out if they mistakingly gave us the large order...it was huge!  Needless to say when the bill came they did in fact give us the small platter (an unbelievable price for such amazingly tasty meat).  The chicken was extremely spicy without even dipping it into the extra sauce, but was incredible as was the flavorful pulled pork and the buns were a perfect soft texture. The one thing I could do without was the Mac and cheese, which wasn't great and could have been cheesier; seemed a little watered down.  However we will absolutely be back here for the service, great selection of beer and incredible meat!",

    "text": "I've been here twice in the last couple of weeks. Once for lunch. I loved it so much that I brought my sister and BIL for dinner. After my experience last night though, I probably won't be coming as often. THEIR HOSTESS WAS ATROCIOUS. She sat us at a 4 person table, after we told her there were 6 of us. She told us she couldn't combine tables, when we saw a waitress moving tables apart. None of this bothered us as much, however, as her attitude.  If you look past the hostess, the rest of our experience was great. Their waitstaff were friendly and attentive both visits. The highlight was definitely their wings. My husband and I preferred the soy garlic, my sister and BIL the spicy BBQ. Also enjoyed their kimchi fries and deviled eggs. My kids seemed to like their kim bap, which was loaded with meat.",

Every dish we had was outstanding. Nothing was mediocre including the the service. A gentleman by the name of Dave.C took care of us   He was extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu and helped us experience a fantastic evening.  I have worked in Kitchens of all aspects for 28 years and a managing Chef for 20.  I am now a GM for a Latin influence fast-casual concept that is rapidly expanding in the Charlotte area.   You have to eat at this restaurant and I can't tell you what to try.  Follow your stomach when you look at that menu. I would believe everything offered in this establishment is probably awesome.  I need to get back here soon to try 10 + other plates ASAP.",

In the brief weekend we moved in, we ate at Seoul Food twice and I can't wait to go back to try more.   Packed at both 8pm and 11pm, both experiences were memorable -- having now ordered the soy garlic wings, pork ribs, broccoli, and Kim-chili mac, I'd definitely continue to stick with the meats and try out different sides. Broccoli was just broccoli with a spicy sauce, and the Kim-chili mac reminded me of Cincinnati chili too much for me to actually enjoy it. On the other hand, both the pork ribs and the wings were incredible.  The bar/restaurant's environment is lively and fun -- we walked by several times and it was never not busy. I'm absolutely looking forward to ordering the soju on my next visit -- each of the ways to drink it were creative, silly, and made for groups.   Will definitely come back and bring others.",

    "text": "So glad the planets/stars/other celestial bodies aligned and I was finally able to get to try this place out.  I was supposed to go play tennis, but the pouring rain said otherwise... and then what I thought was going to be a \"quiet night in\" turned into an amazing feast.  Firstly, I want to commend the servers and staff of this place - I know it probably does take a lot of patience to deal with food noobs to this place.  Everyone was so friendly and had a ton of suggestions - especially since it was my group's first time there.    While we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive, we found a spot underneath the metal awning behind the bar which is probably my favorite spot since you have bar service right in front of you and can people watch into the rest of the entire restaurant.  People will be fighting me for this spot when it gets warmer and the weather becomes more predictable, but for now... I'll take a little rain since it drove people inside.    Our very nice bar server suggested to start with soju, but I was leaning toward the beer- she must have had training from Leonardo DiCaprio and \"inceptioned \" me since I decided to go soju anyway.  I forgot how good soju can be - they offer a ton of different flavors, but I went straight up.  Later a friend ordered the yogurt soju and it came with a smoking shaker....  later I deemed it unicorn tears since it was so good - I've also had a good base of regular soju so my talking filter was unhinged that evening.  The table became ready and everyone arrived so we decided to take the awning party to the table.  The menu has a lot of choices... it's a one page menu, but it can be intimidating.  The BEST part is that you can't go wrong with anything you order... and don't be shy to share!  We ended up trying things off of a complete stranger's table (we traded bites of items).  I love it when food brings people together.  Got to try the pork belly, wings, brunswick stew, kimchi slaw (vinegar), soy deviled eggs, ramen mac & cheese, sweet potato swirl.  My taste buds and stomach were a pair of happy campers that evening.    Overall the place has a great location... I love the fact that they don't let people park on the street in front of the restaurant.  Lets you see the patio and also gives you an unobstructed view of uptown when you are in the patio itself.  The decor is super inviting and comfortable, just like the people working really hard to make sure you have a great experience here.  Great place - I'll definitely be back since I'm within walking distance (a bit dangerous - I can hear the soju bottles trembling behind the bar already.",

My bulgogi sushi roll was what I was looking forward to, but the bulgogi was entirely too tough. I got tired of chewing :-/ My cocktail was watered down.

We ordered the Pork kimbap, soy garlic and spicy bbq wings, ram n cheese, fish tacos, pulled pork, potato rings, soy pickled devil eggs, and you have to partner the Bao bread with the pulled pork and kimchi bbq sauce.

    "text": "We happened upon the Seoul Food Meat Company last Friday while looking for a quick bite before attending a concert at The Fillmore.  We registered our name at the front and were informed it would likely be 1 hour which is to be expected on a Friday at 7pm. We decided to hit the bar for a drink or two before dinner. As fate would have it, we found two seats at the bar and ordered drinks, and, in the interest of time, food as well. Unfortunately, that was when our experience went seriously south. We waited for approximately 55 minutes, while other couples around us that came to the bar after us quickly received their food. The bartender that took our order mumbled something about not being sure what happened and that she was waiting for an explanation from her manager. Immediately after the realization that they had forgotten the order the food magically arrived. While the delay was irritating, what was worse was the meal. I ordered the small brisket and it was cold and bland. I ate maybe 3 bites and pushed it aside. My wife ate the one taco that she ordered, also non-plussed by the flavor, but so hungry that she had no choice. In defense of the restaurant the manager did provide us with her business card with a $30 credit that we could use during a future visit. However, given the lack of flavor of the food and the issue with our order, I would be hard pressed to give them another try. Very disappointed in this place especially given all of the positive reviews.",

    "text": "This was my first time having Korean fried chicken, and it was game-changing. Korean fried chicken wings put regular American bar wings to shame. They are crispy, meaty, plump, and bursting with flavor.   My boyfriend and I shared the half and half (soy garlic and spicy) medium-sized order, which included 10 pieces. Interestingly, our server said that Korean fried chicken takes longer to cook, but it came out within five minutes.   Another game-changer was the pimento cheese corn paired with the most addictive, indulgent shrimp chips. The shrimp chips were so good that when the owner stopped by our table I asked him how I could get more and if they sold it by the bag. He said that they make the chips in-house.   All sides are only $4 each, a reasonable price.   We also ordered a half-order of fire chicken, but it was too spicy for me, and this is coming from someone who loves spicy food. Completing our meal were the bao buns, and we agreed with the server's claim that they were like pillows of bread. If you order protein make sure you put them inside of the bao buns.   The building and decor are industrial and minimalist, and I loved watching the Korean pop videos on the TVs throughout the space.   The only reason that I don't give Seoul five stars was because nobody greeted us for almost ten minutes, and the restaurant wasn't even half-full. We had to wave down a server that was walking by before anyone noticed we were there. Also, the bus boy next to us accidently sprayed us with his cleaner. It was an accident so not a big deal to me, but I can imagine some grump throwing a fit if he gets a mouthful of cleaning chemicals.   This was only its third night open so I am very forgiving, but that service component needs to be fixed if Seoul wants to make a name for itself in Charlotte's competitive food industry.  Overall, I loved the atmosphere, the creative concept, and the delicious fried chicken. I'll definitely return.",

So instead of bringing the kimichi on the side with they brought my fries completly plain with nothing on it , when it usually comes with bougli and 2 different types of sauces !",

We got the fire chicken which was delicious, the pork and the wings. The wings were so delcious!! The only thing about the wings is they say they are spicy but they were not that spicy and even their hot spicy sauce wasn't too spicy to me. The sweet potato nest was really good too, I think ours was a tiny overcooked but they were still good. So besides the food this place has a really awesome back patio. They have soccer pool, a dog park area and beer pong. It was a lot of fun to hang out after we ate.  Cool place to hang out",

However the one outstanding item were the wings which were crispy spicy and cooked perfect. For meats we had the pork belly which was bland and the skin not crispy next the sausages which was ok at best needs to be grinded finer. The sides were all 1 star for me the pimento cheese corn dish was bland and sweet which i did not care for nor did anyone else at the table. The collards were undercooked and bland as could be. Next was the alleged broccoli salad which was blanched broccoli and chile sauce terrible. Our service was wonderful very atentive always full water glass and never an empty beer. I will not be returning a very disappointing weekend night which are few and far between.",

I don't want to discourage you from trying it. I have been to some excellent Korean places with the american twist which may be in part why I feel a bit of a disillusioned....just keep in mind, Charlotte continues to grow its \"gastro-scene!\"   Ultimately, I thought it just didn't make sense. I get what they are trying to do but it just didn't work for me. The Ramen Mac&cheese, well, great concept but it didn't work after it's not longer 100% freshly served  The beef rib was very fatty and didn't have much flavor. The pork belly? How do you ruin this? I am sorry, but no flavor whatsoever. The braised fish taco, I only took a small bite and I was done with it.   I am sorry I started off w the negative. What I can definitely say is that I WILL be BACK for their drinks and great wings! I really couldn't complaint about those two!  Thank you for letting me Yelp/Vent;)",

    "text": "Went to Seoul for the first time on Saturday night. I've heard good things and it definitely did not disappoint. We arrived around 7:30 to get our name on the waiting list. We were meeting friends at 8pm. One thing that was frustrating is that the hostess could not give us an approx. wait time. She did tell us that there were 8 groups of various sizes in front of us, but I have no idea what that means in terms of a potential timeline (she said the same thing to group who came in after us). I was really hungry and kind of wanted to determine whether or not to order an appetizer.  ANYWAY, we were seated about 30 minutes later, which was faster than I was expecting. We ordered the pimento corn cheese. It came out almost immediately and was delicious. It was like pimento cheese but it had a lot of corn in it which added good flavor and texture. It was also served with these rice cakey chips. They were really good and light, which complimented the pimento corn cheese.  I ordered the pulled pork tacos and they were great. The pulled pork had excellent flavor and it was topped with a fusion sauce and cucumbers. Delicious. We also ordered a side of the ram n cheese. It was basically mac n cheese with ramen noodles, and it was SOOOO GOOD. I will definitely order that again.  There are a few reasons I am giving Seoul 4 stars on my first time:  1) There aren't really any healthy menu options - it's all meat and mostly fried sides. Everything I tried was so delicious, but I felt guilty afterwards. 2) It is very loud in there, which is good and bad. It's exciting that so many people are there to enjoy good food and have fun. It was difficult having a conversation at times with our friends. 3) Our waiter brought one check at the end without asking. We were very obviously two couples, so I found it strange that he brought one check and then had to go divide it by couple when we asked. When he brought out the separated checks, they weren't correct so he had to go back and do it a third time. Overall, I just wish he asked how we wanted to split it up before assuming.  Anyway, we will definitely be back to Seoul! This is a hoppin' spot with great food!",

Our waiter, Frances, came out immediately and greeted us and got our drink orders. My company had the pumpkin beer that was on special. Get this, it's pumpkin beer but rimmed with maple syrup and sugar, I don't like beer but this was good! I ordered the lychee temple. Not sure what was in it but it was refreshing and had a pear taste. Very good.   For our meal, we opted for the large crispy pork belly. Now, it was delicious but, the crispy top was way too crispy. It actually hurt my teeth to chew. We ended up just eating the soft middles and leaving the crispy tops.   For our sides, we ordered the Raman Mac and Cheese, the pimento corn cheese, and the soy pickled deviled eggs. The Raman Mac and cheese was really good. We enjoyed that and it was safe to say, it was the first to disappear off the tray. The pimento corn cheese was amazing! Very tasty and a great portion. The soy pickled deviled eggs were <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FTheBomb.com&s=ae83eae981422844786fcbaf1a51c85da356c8ebc9649dad4ee16f0d1ecbcc28\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">TheBomb.com</a>!! My only concern is make it an order of 4 instead of 3. Lol! The great throw down over soy pickled deviled eggs almost happened last night but we are ladies so we cut it down the middle. lol.  For dessert, the green tea sugar biscuits are delicious! We literally had no room left in our stomachs but I always get dessert for review purposes only . So the ice cream is literally green tea, not a flavor but like actual green tea. Try the ice cream. Then try the ice cream with the biscuit. It's a complete game changer. So delicious!  I highly recommend this place. It's incredible, the service is excellent and the price was perfect. We enjoyed ourselves and plan to return soon! Thanks Frances for being an awesome server!",

    "text": "I went here on Friday for lunch with a group of co-workers and oh what a great surprise this little gem was. We had a party of 7 however we still didn't wait but 5 minutes to be seated. The decor inside is simple yet chic with wood tables and thankfully a nice music playlist of hits was playing in the background (I hate a stuffy environment). The waitress came and we let her know this was our first time at the restaurant. She explained that the meats are ordered separately from the side.   Me and a few of my co-workers decided to spilt a few food items and ordered wings (half & half), Ramen Mac & Cheese, Green Tea Corn Bread, and Kimchi fries. The food didn't take very long considering we had 7 people in our party but the wings did take a little longer to come out than the sides. However, it was worth the wait. The wings were some of the best wings I have had...light yet crispy and the sauce was unique but I liked it. The half and half wings included both the spicy and soy wings and I think I prefer the soy but I equally enjoyed them both. Let me just say this...I can't wait to eat these wings again. They were that good and even better as leftovers the next day.   Now let's move on to the sides Green Tea Corn Bread didn't disappoint as I'm a carb lover and the sweet butter was the icing on top. It's really hard to mess up fries so the fries were good but not anything extra special (again they were needed as I'm a carb lover). Now while the Ramen Mac & Cheese was good it's just mac & cheese so I wish I had of spent my $4 on another side. Either way I will be back anyway and I will try some of the other sides.   Additional feedback from my co-workers: A lot of gluten friendly options which is a plus, one of my co-workers is team meatless and loved the tofu, someone else had the Brunswick stew and thought it was some of the best they ever had.",

The best was the wings and service. The staff was personable and the wings were out of this world. The best amount of crisp and we got the half and half sauces. Both the spicy bbq and soy garlic were delicious. The spicy bbq sauce was essentially the same sauce as the sauce you get at most Korean restraunt to spice up your meal, but on the wings it was wonderful. But the soy garlic was my favorite.   The staff was very friendly and multiple people checked up on our table to be sure that everything was good. They also had a pretty good beer menu with both Asian and local beer selections.   The one thing we did not like was the ramen Mac and cheese. It was a little dry and underwhelming. The rest of the food was pretty great. The kimchi slaw was a welcome side dish and the sweet potato birds nest was the lil bit of sweet to top everything off perfectly.   I will be back. Charlotte offers a lot of great places to eat, but this one will become a staple.",

    "text": "Yes, y'all. Yes.   I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now so my boyfriend decided to surprise me with dinner here on a Saturday night. We found parking really easily in the parking lot next to it (although the parking lot was super dark) and went inside to put our names on the wait list. We were quoted 45 minutes and were lucky enough to grab two seats at the bar. We started with the Seoul Fashioned (for him) and the Lychee-tini (for me). Both were super strong - in fact, mine was too strong and I gave it to my boyfriend. I will say that I felt the portions of the drink were kinda small for the price ($10-$12). I asked the bartender for something sweeter and she recommended the Keep Pounding Punch. It was more delicious (in my opinion) and more reasonably priced ($8). By this time, our table became available.   Once seated, my boyfriend ordered another drink- the fruit punch beer, which he loved. We then ordered various items off of the menu: half and half wings, cracklings, potato swirl, steamed buns, brisket taco, and fire chicken. My favorites were the taco and the soy wings. I DON'T EVEN REALLY LIKE WINGS, but the soy ones were superb! My boyfriend liked the wings best, as well. We made friends with the table next to us, including a couple who says they've eaten here several times. They highly recommended the beef ribs and said the pulled pork isn't great, so my fella is already planning on trying the ribs next time.   I also have to say, we had great service. Everyone from the bartender to our server (I think her name was Susan) to the person who brought out our food was really friendly and accommodating. It seemed like everyone who works there enjoys working there and that made for a great experience as a customer.   There a few things that would've made this even better: - better portion sizes for some of the mixed drinks - hooks for purses to hang on the table. The chairs are curved on the back so purses can't hang there and I refuse to put mine on the floor - lights in the parking lot  All in all, this was an awesome spot and my boyfriend has already dubbed it as a top contender for his favorite bar in Charlotte. We will definitely be back!",

It was spicy but I was expecting the squid to be hot. I would try a different flavor next time. I got 4 different sides (kimchi fries, deviled eggs, Brunswick stew, and corn cheese dip). My favorite was the kimchi fries and the corn cheese dip. SO DELICIOUS! The portions were huge! One thing I didn't like was how I couldn't order extra chips for my dip. I was willing to pay extra but they don't not give you that option unless you order another portion of dip. Also, I felt like everything I ordered had kimchi in it, which is delicious, but I wish they would highlight other Korean flavors.  We ordered the pork belly, it was average.  The star of show was definitely the chicken wings and sides!",

I came on a Saturday evening with a 20 person reservation, and they were happy to have us and the service was surprisingly good for that amount of people! The server at our table was very patient as it was most people's first time, and we all left full and happy. It's definitely best to go family style with whatever size group you have, in order to try everything they have to offer and split the cost. Everyone shared what they ordered and the highlights were the Fire Chicken, both flavor wings (they only have 2 which my personal favorite was the red chili paste), and the ramen mac & cheese. The kimchi spare ribs were too subtle in flavor but they were cooked nicely. Might as well just order a side of kimchi with something else.  And of course with the large group we had to share the watermelon and lychee sojus. Without some soju shots, it's not a True Korean night out!",

I ordered the fire chicken and he got the pork ribs. The fire chicken was well seasoned, but then it was smothered in cheese. It was reminiscent of a Taco Bell quesadilla minus the shell; but it was a lot more expensive.  My friend could not even eat the pork ribs. So he rated it as a 1.5.  The Yelp reviews have said that the wings were great, so I will try them the next time I'm in the area. But I would advise anyone that wants a nice meal to avoid. It was more like southern BBQ with a tiny hint of Korean flavor.",

Well let's just say they enjoyed it so much they wanted to go again on their most recent visit. We also told my best friend and fellow yelp elite Anisha H to come join she also was very much impressed.  They have fried pork skins and giant beef rib ramen Mac and cheese but I will be honest with you just go with the chicken wings!!!! This is a Korean southern style fusion restaurant so they have soy pickled deviled eggs kimchi mayo and kimchi vintager slaw, crispy pork but the wings to me are the star of the show!  I got the soy garlic wings which have a hint of sweet notes too it that we crispy and bbq another words they were like kfc honey bbq wings times 10! They have an outdoor patio which was lively on the night we went and was a perfect backdrop to a great meal. They also have private karaoke rooms that you can rent out call in advance.   I have to shout out the Manager Christy, she not only did she come by to check on us but wound up having a great conversation with us and we even recommended her to go to one of my sisters favorite spots in NYC Fat Buddha!",

I highly recommend going here for their wings, leave out the tacos. Also try the frozen bubble  tea, the bubbles are yogurt and they can add liquor if desired.",

    "text": "Aright y'all this place is the BOMB. Where else are you going to get fantastic food, beer and games in the back, as well was Karaoke?! No but really, this place was so much fun. The food at Seoul is mostly wings which all I'm going to say about that is, between my 12 friends I tried just about every flavor and loved them all. Here's the cool part, all you vegetarians out there, they have tofu wings! And this is coming from my somewhat picky vegetarian girlfriend, she was a fan of the tofu wings so dig in! I'd also recommend getting the sweet potato birds nest, it legit looks like a birds nest with the fine bits of sweet potato - it's a winner for sure.   Now that we covered the food, time for Karaoke! Yes this place has 3 private Karaoke rooms with a designated waiter to each and you never have a bad time at Karaoke. I'd recommend going on a Sunday, it's half off the room rent so it's $30 an hour as opposed to the usual $60, and with a decently that's dirt cheap. The rooms are, for lack of better verbiage, LIT. The night we went also had a tent up in the back with a bar and all sorts of games from beer pong to table tennis and such so that was definitely a lot of fun!   ProTip: Get a reservation for big parties, this place is busy busy busy. And the same goes for Karaoke.",

    "text": "TL;DR Version: - Great Wings!!! Best in Charlotte (BBQ / sauce based) - Great tasting food / Meats. Remember it's NOT traditional Korean BBQ. - Fun atmosphere. Cool karaoke rooms.  Longer Review:  Food: 5/5 The wings alone are worth the visit. Definitely get the 1/2 and 1/2. I usually get a take-out order of wings each week so yeah, I've done thorough research. You're welcome.  A note for my fellow discerning wing connoisseur: you can request all flats (boo!) or all drums (the best part of the wing) for $1 more. The other non-chicken wing meats are delicious too. So are the non-meat food options. The birds nest is another go to for me.   Location: 4.5/5 I like that it's a bit tucked away from the main street (South Blvd) but still convenient to get to in South End. Parking is usually not an issue and there's plenty of bars a short walking distance away.  Value: 5/5 The price is moderate and well deserved given the quality, quantity and taste of the food. Customer service has always been friendly during my visits, especially my take-out orders.  Service: 5/5 Top notch service over at Seoul. Very attentive and the wait times for picking up your grub is usually around $20. It's become more popular so you may want to RSVP if they do that.  Atmosphere: 5/5 I've been to Seoul since it first opened and the updates they've made are pretty solid. There's some pretty dope karaoke rooms with awesome ambiance courtesy of wall paintings. You soak up the sun and your adult beverage outside while playing a plethora of games outside like corn-hole, etc. This spot is pretty legit for tailgating since it's in close proximity to Panther's stadium.",

    "text": "Seoul Food has been on my must-try list for a while now and I ended up stopping in by accident last weekend. I had been at a nearby brewery with my husband and on our walk back toward South End, saw the patio for Seoul and stopped in for another beer thinking it was actually a different brewery. When we realized where we were, we put in our names for a table and enjoyed a beer on the patio while we waited. The outdoor space is awesome if you're just looking to hang out and they have a great beer selection.   We waited about an hour for a table and were first sat at a high top near the windows. We were actually never greeted after waiting at the table for a while, so we ended up asking to sit outside, which worked out well since our server out there was friendly and attentive. We ordered the pork belly, spare ribs, ram n' cheese, pimento cheese corn, and a spring roll. The pork belly was ridiculously crispy, I really don't know how they do it. The ribs were also delicious. The ram n' cheese was a fun take on mac-it wasn't life changing but it's a really cool dish. We loved the pimento corn cheese, it was super flavorful and the corn added a nice sweetness to the pimento. In general I found the portions generous and we had a nice box of leftovers to take home. I'm glad we stumbled in here and can't wait to come try more dishes.",

They have a great selection of drinks, with my personal favorite being the butter beer.  Pro tip: if it's a crazy busy night; order to-go and go hang out at Unknown Brewery!",

Not a table top grill to be found.  What is to be found is some tasty food and quality service.  Seoul Food is a mash up of Southern BBQ and Korean flavors along with some Korean ingredients.  We showed up on a Saturday close just after noon and the place was busy but not packed though it got quite packed by the time we left.  One of the things they are known for are their Korean style double-fried wings which come in two flavors, spicy (think flavor, not tons of heat) and soy garlic so we went with 6 of each flavor and threw in a couple different tacos, a pulled pork with kimchi and a brisket version.    The wings are Crispy with that capital C there for a reason and the leftovers stayed that way eaten cold out of the fridge the next day.  I preferred the soy garlic over the spicy.  Neither of us thought much of the pulled pork taco but the brisket one was excellent.  The food comes out tapas style so when it's ready it hits the table.  The service was good and we were in and out fairly quickly.  The only other comment is that I went for the Bloody Mary bar and it was just ok.  Nothing special in terms of quality/quantity of options.  I did like the wasabi you could add and the pickled asparagus though.",

I get the soy garlic and they are not overpowering at all. They are a nice size and you won't be disappointed.   I also had a brisket bulgogi taco. It was so good and flavorful. The only complaint is that it was kind of oilily. It didn't change the flavor at all, it just made it messy. It also came in a bowl that was too small for the taco so it was spilling on the table.   For the side, I always get the Ram n Cheese. This side is like eating heaven. Super cheesy and I could probably live in it. I would be okay if it came with a little bit more as it's not a sharable size. But, to be honest, it's so good, I recommend to be selfish with it anyways.    Last time I was there I had the crispy pork belly and some steamed buns. They were both really good but for the price of the steamed buns, I would get something else. The pork belly is a large portion so share that for sure.   If I could I would give them a 4.5/5 as I think they are higher than a 4. You won't be disappointed by going but take in mind that during dinner time it can be very crowded and you might have to wait a while. They do have some cool games to play outside by the bar.",

Don't be swayed by the wait or the trek that you'll probably have to make (because you're gonna be parking all the way down the street) -because it's all worth it.  My boyfriend and I probably ordered way more than we could handle but lawd, I wouldn't have changed a thing. - Pimento Cheese Corn w/shrimp chips: 4/5 - This was DELICIOUS! The cheese really helped offset how spicy some of the other dishes were and was so so yum. - Kim Baps (Pulled Pork, Fire Chicken): 4/5 - It took me a while to figure out but the flavor of fire chicken was prob inspired by the spicy noodles. This was a good kick and was very filling. I didn't really like the pulled-pork kim bap but it was a welcome change from all the other asian flavors. - 12 hr beef rib (5/5) - We were eating this wrong until our waiter came by to help us LOL. Make sure you dip in the sauce because waowaowao, it elevated the flavor forreal. - Soy garlic wings (10/5) - This was AMAZING. Soy garlic has been my jam and this place does it right. Definitely order this! Most tables around us were ordering wings left and right! - Pineapple soju - So so so good.   If you aren't convinced.. let me tell you again. Southern BBQ w/Korean flavors proves to be freakin' delicious.",

The Korean BBQ place next door (Let's Meat) is absolutely wonderful, the quality of meat is delicious, for a KBBQ place, it is exceptionally clean. (I digress).  We're seated and our server comes by to give us the intro on the menu. I like that they make it clear that this is not a Korean restaurant - more like inspired by Korean food. We ordered quite a few apps, and different meats, and tacos, etc.   I think the food quality was fine. It was nothing spectacular. I would totally come back, however, the atmosphere was just SO SO noisy. We were screaming to speak to each other. I just would come at lunch time (or not a weekend).",

Get reservations because without them, the wait was 1 to 1.5hrs, so we decided to have take out from them instead. Take out was supposed to take about 15 to 20 minutes we got our food after 30. The problem is the food came out in a paper bags but needed to be reopened at the door and checked again. We thought it was odd and inefficient to have people in the kitchen package everything and then have to reopen the bags again. Suggestion, maybe you guys should label your containers and don't send it out of the kitchen until people's entire order is done.  The place was extremely busy with people overfilled in the patio and crowded around the bar. Appeared to be a trendy place for the college crowd. Average age was probably 25. Extremely loud, you couldn't even hear the person beside you. The game was on near the bar.   Despite all that, the food was delicious. We split the medium size of the half and half fried tofu (spicy wasn't as spicy as I expected), smoked beef brisket (so good), fish taco (good) and the sweet potato nest (surprised they were able to get sweet potatoes so crispy and loved the hint of cinnamon), Bao buns (3 in the order), and brown rice as sides. This was enough to share between 3 people with left overs.   Food was (5/5), Ambiance (1/5), service (3.5/5) and therefore over all was about 3.5/5.",

Luckily this last time we were nearby and the wait was only 20 minutes - we spent that time playing jumbo jenga, foot pool (soccer balls) and corn hole. I'm so glad we waited. Both types of wings we ordered were AMAZING - and I'm not a big wing fan, but these were can't miss wings. We tried several other items, the pickled deviled egg was ok, the spring rolls were and we liked the kim chili with mac n cheese.   It's not a great place to bring kids, although they would enjoy the outside my kids are picky AF and wouldn't eat anything on their menu - much to my parenting fail chagrin.",

I tipped $5, but apparently that wasn't enough in the eyes of the server, so they entered a higher amount when they finished out the credit card transaction. Many people don't bother to reconcile their credit card statements, so there are probably a lot of ripoffs that go unnoticed. Beware!",

We were seated immediately upon arriving (sans reservations).  Abstract, our server, was awesome.  Calm and cool, didn't mind all of our questions, refilled drinks in a timely manner, could do no wrong!  My husband and I ordered several things to share. The Spicy Wings were delicious, similar to Korean Fried Chicken wings we get at other places, so we were very happy with these. A Kimchi Pork Taco was also very tasty, though a little harder to share as it was a single taco. The bulgogi kim bap (not sushi!!!) was very good. We also had spring rolls, crispy and oh-so-good.  Their menu changes a bit from time to time, but something I always see on it are the Green Tea Sugar Biscuits.  Don't hesitate. Get them for dessert. Hell, get them for your appetizer, your meal, whatever, just get them. Sugary, crispy, cool, and melty all at the same time.  Yum.  We will be back in a few months when we are in town! Definitely worth it!",

I ordered the soy wings and a spiral potato. Both were great. The wings are really good. First off, they're really nice size. They're saucy but crispy like others have said. I'm really glad I chose them. The spiral potato is crispy and cooked well. I didn't really enjoy the sauce that came with it, only because I don't really care for shrimp sauce, but since it comes on the side it's oookkkk. I did try a few dips and it wasn't bad. If you like shrimp sauce you'll love this sauce. The potato itself is amazing. It's crispy and crunchy. I'll definitely get it again. Service was really good but the highlight for me was my introduction to what the waiter called \"k-pop\". It's Korean pop music they play on the TVs in the restaurant. It's really cool and the artist are really talented. Overall, I think this place is really cool. Can't wait to try another wing flavor.",

    "text": "What to get: half and half soy garlic and spicy wings Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: bar and snack place, large, busy space Wait: 20 mins (Friday 7PM for 1) Parking: street parking, some small parking lots  The Experience: This is actually a 3.5, but I like rounding up. This place is very popular and a great spot for drinking and snacking. I love my Asian snacks on a Friday night, but so does a lot of people in Charlotte. Be prepared to wait during their popular times, even if you're coming solo like I did.  Parking was kind of tough. I circled twice and you have to read some of the signs to be sure you're not parking illegally. A neighboring company does the pay mobile app on your phone, but if you're there, it charges for overnight fees by dinner time...so I'm unsure if other people also paid the overnight fee or just parked without knowing.  The place itself is extensive. There's the indoor dining area, an outdoor front patio, and a back patio with games to play. They also have karaoke. Perfect place for college kids. Although you probably want to bring groups here, it can get tough with the wait, even if you're going to just sit at the bar.  I'll cut to the food. You get the wings. I personally liked the soy garlic wings, which had a kind of thick crust on it when fried. The spicy wings were tasty as well. You can order wings as half and half so you can taste both.  I also tried the potato swirl, which was kind of fun. The cut was thinner than I thought, so it was like eating thicker chips. Plus you get a sauce to dip it in. It's fun to try, but I wouldn't get it again.  Flavored soju was a bit expensive, but it's only right to wash it down with either beer or soju. Lychee soju is lightly sweetened with a few lychee on a pick for you.  Lastly, service is courteous, but can get swamped. I try to go easy on them and be extra patient when it's busy, but be sure to wave them down every once in awhile. Sometimes it takes awhile for them to get to you.  Overall, a fun place, especially for happy hour, drinks, and Korean-influenced snacks. I probably won't be back for awhile, but I hope that they can possibly open another location to alleviate the crowds. I'd love to see it grow.",

If its all too crowded, they deliver short range (like to nearby breweries!) Highly recommend Seoul Food Meat Company!",

The only reason it gets a 4 star in my eyes is because the wait is ridiculously long, especially as of lately. It's super popular but I think it's time they either have a wait list system added to their process or expand the space. Sometimes you're forced to wait 90+ minutes and usually it's tough for the people at the desk to track it.",

Medium-big wait for a proper table inside and kinda tight and kinda noisy so we eventually found ourselves out to the patio (sign says no glass past the door) on a warm sunny afternoon. Not sure how this plays when it gets hot hot but dining out of doors in the spring in the shade is good by me. Found two at the bar, got situated, got waters, got menus, got some help figuring out what it all meant... sort of. On recommendation we sampled crispy pork bellies: oh my, this is the biggest small ever! (love/hate to see a large) 25mm bits fried hard on the rind and hot and soft and wet everywhere else with a little taste of the mainland in a savorable sweet brown sauce; ram -n- cheese: because it's PPF and some long stringy noodley thingy in cheese is universally good everyhow you do it; spring rolls: lightly fried and crisp and perfect for early June; plus dirty white rice and fruit punch to wash it down. Got a kim-chili for giggles, MLB says \"Ooo! Hot!\" I say \"Kimchi in lieu of standard spicinesses, neat!\" Finished with green tea ice cream on sweet biscuits which eats exactly as good as you'd expect.",

We also ordered kimchi fries which was one of the best kimchi fries I've had. We also got the salad which was so flavorful. One of my fav part was the service! Our waiter, Gabbie V, was the nicest and most patient waiter I've ever had. Because we were from out of town and didn't know anything, she answered our questions with so much grace. She checked on us constantly - Shoutout to Gabbie! We told the manager she was great and he said she is one of the best servers. The manager was also very nice and welcoming. He recommended us the kbbq place next door that's owned by them as well for a more traditional kbbq. Sad we couldn't make it there. Overall, this is a must go, must try place!",

I would recommend coming with a large party so you can order more things and sample everything.   The half and half wings were my favorite. Both flavors were equally good. The wings are ginormous and had a thick, flavorful, crispy coating. The spicy wings were barely spicy, and I have a pretty low heat tolerance. I also recommend the choiang brocolli, which also says spicy on the menu but is not at all.  The crispy pork belly was ok, just VERY crispy, almost to the point where it was hard to chew. It comes with a really good sauce and I'd recommend ordering the bao buns to go with it.   The ambiance is pretty modern/rustic which I enjoyed a lot. The food is expensive though, definitely more than I was expecting.",

    "text": "So while in Charlotte for a year, I had been meaning to check this place out for a while given the word of mouth traffic that it seems to get among fellow travelers to the city. We finally were able to have a \"team dinner\" and made our way over to this joint after making a reservation on a weekday. The joint was busy already by the time we walked in and continued to be busy as the night progressed. The joint itself has enough tables for groups and tables along with a bar hosting a suite of drinks.   We were seated in the middle of the dining room with our group of 10 people eagerly awaiting our menus/meals. The server was very helpful and very quick to provide anything the group needed. I was certainly excited to see the \"Korean spin\" given my roots on southern bbq. After perusing the menu, the group decided to order the beef ribs, pulled pork, the pork belly, and the fire chicken for meats. We then proceeded to order the wings along with the ramen mac and cheese, the kimchi  fries, and tacos. We accompanied all this food with of course some soju . The food came out fairly quickly on large platters and we were all able to get a flavor of all the different food. Starting with the sides, the kimchi fries were delicious and simple and offered a good way to start the meal and great for any fry lovers. The ramen mac and cheese was good although it seemed just more standard mac and cheese then the fusion flavoring I was searching for but still a solid dish. The tacos were delicious and they all disappeared fairly quickly from the table. The meats were all very tender and well cooked. The beef rib came out on a huge bone and was tender off the bone. The pulled pork was again delish with the meat being tender and the marinade being just right on them. The pork belly was crispy on the outside with the frying process and were good. I think they were probably my least memorable but definitely worth a buy especially with groups. The fire chicken was BOMB. The chicken is honestly so juicy and tender and just packed with flavor. My buddy and I were busy inhaling all bites of this and instantly regretted when we ran out of it. The chicken wings were also good. They were standard wings to me that I could get anywhere else so no fusion aspect which was slightly disappointing but overall all the food was very good.  I am glad that I was able to check this place out prior to leaving Charlotte. It certainly has great service, great food, and a fun atmosphere. This is definitely worth a  stop for any people in Charlotte and for any BBQ lovers.",

    "text": "Finally made it over here! Great addition to the gold district!   We went late on a Sunday night. I was happy to see that the back patio was still open and they were still serving food even though it was after 9 o'clock.  We decided to sit on the new back patio they just built. They have an impressive adult playground they just built with beer pong and other fun games to play. It is the perfect patio for a spring day with friends.  We decided to get some late-night eats. We got the sweet potato Birdsnest, The pork belly and fish tacos, and the corn pimento cheese.   I've heard their wings are their best feature, but I am not a big wing fan so we did not try them.  We are very happy with the food that we had. It was SUPER FAST! The food literally came out in five minutes after ordering. The sweet potato Birdsnest was a nice side item and was sweet. The corn pimento cheese was delicious. They serve this with \"shrimp chips.\" I wasn't a huge fan of these, but I loved the pimento cheese. Both tacos were of decent size and we're loaded with meat. We were very happy to have these and they were big enough to share.  The bartender was very attentive and kind. They also have a great selection of craft beer and cocktails. I like that they have a Korean liquor I've never heard of. I always like trying something new. You can buy this in a cocktail mixer to share with friends, which is a great idea.  They have also just added private karaoke rooms. If you have never done this before- DO IT!!! They have rooms ranging from $30-$100. They are easy to rent in a blast with friends. This is a great idea and something you can't find anywhere else in town.  We will be back. Good drinks, good food, and a great patio. They have all of the things they need to succeed in South End/Gold district.",

Let me preface this by saying it is no where near traditional Korean food but is instead a fusion place that takes southern BBQ dishes and puts a Korean spin on it. The food here though is amazing! When I was there I had a sausage, the kimchi fries, and the pimento cheese corn dip. I was blown away at the flavor each item had. I am a True Korean food lover so I really enjoyed seeing many familiar flavors in the dishes. Check the website to see when happy hour is!",

If it's your first time, go for the wings!!! But honestly, with all that I tried, I don't think you can go wrong with any dish! And the service, amazing staff!

The aesthetic is very modern southern, with wooden table tops and metal chairs. The food is served on baking sheets covered in parchment paper with food on paper trays.   It seems like the optimal way to eat is family style, which I believe is the best way. Just order a bunch of food, try everything, then split the bill evenly with your friends. I recommend getting a salad with all your food, just to balance things out.  I highly recommend giving this place a try.",

She did try to see if I could exchange the dish or take it off but the manager was being a jerk.   Y'all should better describe your items or just take that one off because it's not that good of a dish.   & I really did want a refund or the ability to swap that weird dish out for another one.",

My main complaint is that once our food was out and we were done eating and beginning to nibble around the rest. Our waitress and other wait staff kept coming by our tables asking to take our items (water at that, which members of our party are still drinking).   Then after being there for an hour, a normal time to sit for dinner and catch up with friend. A waitress from another section walks over and takes the bags on our table that our main waitress bought over for us to box our food and begins bagging our food and basically kicking us out.   It was very odd and I have never experience such. Customer service. While the wings are amazing, I really do not recommend any other items on the menu.

We ordered tacos, wings, and drinks. We asked for water and Susan told us they didn't serve that. They never once told us that it was self serve until I approached the manager.  I'm extremely regretful I spent $40.00 at this establishment and received well below average service and was lied to repeatedly. The manner of the staff was severely unprofessional...",

Perfect blend of Korean comfort food!, walks the line just right! The Ramen Mac n cheese, kimchi slaw and pimento cheese corn were all incredible! Can't wait to come back. Also.... The keep pounding punch is like a vacation in your mouth, so try that cocktail while you wait, bc I'm sure there will be one for a while. This place is awesome.",

However we couldn't get a bartender to pay us any attention without us waving them down. And this was a regular occurrence for everyone who sat around us during the evening. Our food was amazing. The drinks were pretty good.   Now to my second experience...I came back 4/13 for dinner with my boyfriend and it was a terrible experience. From the time it took to get our drinks to the 40 minutes it took to get our food even though the tables on both sides of us ordered after we did got their food before us to the service. It was just a mess. And the management told us there was some confusion in the kitchen (whatever that means) and that was why we didn't get our food. When we got our food it was delicious which is the only thing that made it tolerable. The manager gave us 20% off which I feel like is unacceptable considering I waited 40 minutes and two tables I know for a fact ordered and were served before me. Additionally our server didn't inquire about why our food was not coming until we brought it to his attention. It was just underwhelming overall. It will be a long time before I come back to this place and I'll hope the service is better but I won't hold my breath.",

The beef rip is enormous and very tender. The hot chicken was awesome with the bao buns. Lastly and the best part of the meal was the wings. We ended up ordering both options and they were equally excellent...maybe the best wings I've ever had. They had a nice almost crunchy texture and were larger than you would normally expect. And the sauces were both very good.   The service was also great. The waitress and bartender were both very nice and helpful.   The only compliant I have was the limited menu, from what I hear due to the opening wiped them out. Even with that compliant I would still give this a 5 star. I'm excited to head back soon and try the other food options.",

They emphasize that their style is very non traditional, and by this they mean that it's a very ham-fisted attempt to fuse Korean and southern cuisine. One side involved topping ramen noodles with cheese. That kinda speaks for itself. The menu is fun but ultimately not worth the money unless you're with kids or are catching up with old friends who want to have fun but not really eat anything good. That being said, people from Charlotte love this place. Which speaks for itself.",

It was a very nice establishment, however it's a bit on the small side inside however they do have an outdoor area and because this restaurant is so popular it can be a bit tight especially bc they don't have a large enough waiting area so just be ready to wait outside. The menu is priced very well, considering the portion side of each item. In all, the FOOD WAS AMAZING! Being our first time, we did go overboard and order tons of food but I must say The kimchi fries, both variety of the wings and the spring rolls were my favorite along with the green tea sugar biscuits for dessert.",

Parking was very easy to find and the wait was not long at all. As we are waiting had some fun at the word search glass. Nice touch!  We were greeted right away by our waiter who offered Everton the menu! He was very friendly and helpful with some of the items!  He recommended some great items! We tried the beef rib with an order of the best wings!! Kimichi fries were a great touch! I ordered the Pineapple Soju! It's supposed to be for sharing but I was able to enjoy it on my own! We were stuffed!   During the meal we were greeted by the owners Tim and Lisa! They were so nice to come and check on us.  As we finished our meal, we checked out the outside area. As we walked around back, we were shocked to see KTV!!! Karaoke!! They had several rooms that can get the party started! We went outside to see a bar with their very own beer! Lots to choose from, I tried the grapefruit beer! So yummy!  As we were drinking we played a game of connect four and giant jenga! They also had corn hole and soccer pool! So cute! And did I mention the doggy area?!  Had a great time here and will definitely come back!!",

Ordered 2 small plates- spicy broccoli and corn- which were good but not enough to get me back. Tried my dining partner's kimchi slaw which was actually quite tasty- my fav. Also had medium order of wings 1/2 and 1/2. The wings were good and crispy but really huge and too much breading for my liking. The greatest disappointments were the cocktails- very watered down for the premium $12 & $14 costs. I generously give this place a 3 rating, and I am not likely to return.",

I had the fire chicken which I heard was popular and a side of the ramen mac and cheese. The fire chicken consisted of chicken breast covered with what tasted like a spicy barbecue sauce and shredded cheese on top. It wasn't too spicy, but there was a sauce on the side just in case you needed a little more kick!  The ramen mac was pretty good, just be sure that you mix it well before you dig in, or else you might miss some of the flavor.  Sn: our server did say the wings were popular, and that is what my dad ordered. He had the soy garlic, and I must say. THEY TASTED AMAZING. The glaze was PERFECT.

I do think they should give 4 buns with the order. Also the broccoli salad was cold and we were a big fan of that. Overall the seasoning and flavors were def worth giving this a taste!!",

I thought twice but based on the reviews I figured I'd give it a chance. We ordered pulled pork, an order of wings in both sauces, the kimchi slaw, the pimento corn dip and one of the potatoes on a stick. I wouldn't say we didn't try enough variety to get a feel for the place. The food was ok but nothing special. The pork wasn't very smoky, the wings were drenched in sauce, we could've skipped the slaw, the pimento corn dip would be better warm and the best part was the fried potato. The portions are pretty small so it adds up quick unless you go during happy hour like we did. No issues with service but I can't say I'll be back.",

Parking is a little tricky, as that area--although new--appears to get busy in the evenings. We had a moderate wait for a table as well, it is was very popular that night.   What I really liked about this place is that it appeals to a variety of people. I saw young people, old people, people from a variety of walks of life--I like that. And that's a good sign the food is good. And it was! Even my dinner companion loved the food--which is a big feat because he normally doesn't enjoy Asian food. The flavors were strong, and it the food was unique. Definitely stop by!",

Water service was a little strange. Why bring me a new water instead of using a water pitcher? After all, I'm drinking out of a plastic water cup.   With all this being said, I do want to go back and try items I missed out on! After all, we atleast had great service!",

The quantity of the food was great for its dollar value. The service of our server was excellent. He was very attentive and was sure to explain the menu to us in full, and answer any random questions we had. Now to the flavor of the food. There were some things that were better than others. We tried the spring roll (great), the deviled eggs (good), and multiple preparations of pork. I felt the pork belly was just okay as was the kimchee pork. The chicken wings were tasty. But I will say everything tasted pretty one note. No matter what we ordered seemed to have the exact same flavor profile. I will try it again just to make sure to have a more rounded experience.",

It was about 8PM on Tuesday night and this place wasn't much crowded at the time.  Got a table pretty quick and was attended pretty quickly as well. Our server Dylan - is a great guy, he is very enthusiastic and interactive and made sure everything was alright with us the whole time we were there. The Food - you must be bored of reading same kind of reviews. The Food was GREATTT.  Their menu is small but the taste is big.  We ordered a small Fire Chicken, a small wings (soy garlic) and a Asian ginger beer.  Loved the ginger beer, but $8 is a bit steep though. Fire chicken was delicious - the portion was big enough, its basically boneless chicken, chicken meat pulled off of thighs I believe, cooked to perfection with juicy inside and coated with their spicy sauce and cheese on top.  Awesome, loved it.  The sauce is what takes it to a whole different level.  We also got the boa buns, it was fun to look at them lol we sandwiched the chicken inside boa buns and made a burger for ourselves.  For 9 bucks I felt it was worth it. Wings - ordered a small portion soy garlic sauce wings.  these wings are big, nicely fried (great crunch) and juicy inside.  again the sauce - makes me crave for more!! there was little touch of sweetness and that's a winner for me.  again for 9 bucks, worth it. The atmosphere is great, the ambience is great, all young guys and girls working there, a bit loud music, open bay windows, nice bar set up/ area, they use rice barn oil for all frying.   A great place to hangout with friends/love ones for sure.",

I asked if I could swap mine out for a different side and explained that I didn't care for the taste of it. Well, long story short, the manager wouldn't exchange the items and told us that we'd still be charged for the ones we didn't eat.  I told her that I'd never dined anywhere that wouldn't fix the customer dissatisfaction (not that it's common) but it was to no avail.  Needless to say, I'll miss the wings because I won't be back and I'm now glad that my blogging group stopped having our monthly meetings there.",
