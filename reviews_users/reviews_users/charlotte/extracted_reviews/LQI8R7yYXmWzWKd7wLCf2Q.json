It's very thick and heavy, but I love it. And they give you LOTS of it.  I think it's cute how the entrees come with a deveiled egg. And they're good so no complaints! The key lime pie is really good also.  My dad had their pimento sandwich and seemed to hate it. The shrimp & grits are... \"ok\".  The decor is meh. Not to say that I have to have an extravagant surrounding to enjoy a meal, but it was a little off-putting on my first visit. The service isn't very good for the most part. The server will be there and then not there. And even when they're not busy, everything still seems to be slow.  If you want some good home cooking, I'd try it out. But I wouldn't expect to be \"wow\"ed.",

Noticed the very cheesy strand as I spread the dip on a piece of pita, half way thru the serving. So no telling how much cheesy hair goodness I consumed! Told the waiter who seemed to be bored with my discovery and offered \"a little discount\".   So surely, the main course would redeem Dish. (Which we visited because it was featured on PBS) But no,  my careful inspection of my plate of salmon patties revealed.....you guessed it, HAIR!!!!!!!  Have you guys ever heard of a hair net???? I found hair in the mac'n cheese that time.  Maybe they should just add it as a side dish.  Needless to say I did not eat the food.  Same non-concerned response from the waiter.  So to top it off, (no I did not try dessert) the waiter took $2.50 off of our bill. We didn't ask for a discount, he offered and that's what my hairy experience was worth. But I chose not to complain about that little obsurdity because they wont see me there again. IF I WANT TO EAT HAIR, I WILL LICK A HAIRY MAN'S BACK...IT'S THE SAME THING!!!!!",

    "text": "When friends recommended Dish to me and my wife, we had only been in Charlotte for a month or so. They gave it a two word description: comfort food. They weren't kidding. Being a Michigan native, I was eager to sample some southern eats, so I had to start off with the fried green tomatoes, which had a light breading with just a hint of cayenne. My wife ordered the chicken and dumplings and I don't think I've seen her that happy with a meal in a long time. I had the cajun meatloaf, and it was a serious slice of meatloaf.   It was one of those meals where you almost annoy yourself by saying how good the food is after each bite.  Don't go there expecting a fine dining experience. This isn't to say that  the services wasn't good because it was, but it's definitely a dive, and it's somehow the perfect feel for the food.  When my wife's family came for a visit we took them there, and it is literally the first time in the seven years that i've known them that everyone really liked their meal.",

It was not pleasing to the eye or palate.  Maybe I should stick to what I know I like or maybe something in the kitchen has changed?. I am pretty sure the fried green tomatoes have changed?

We started with the collard dip (how could you not) which was served with either tortilla chips and/or pita bread.  At the recommendation of the waiter we ordered with pita bread.  The bread was okay, but I'll go for the chips next time.  The collard dip was great though, just as you expect collards to taste like but with a lovely texture and cheesy zip.    My wife had the salmon patties with orange butter, tomatoes & okra, and mac & cheese.  I went for the cajun meatloaf and mashed potatoes with mac & cheese.  Both were extremely good.  The meatloaf had a slight nip of spice but not overpowering at all.  The potatoes & meatloaf were lightly dressed with a brown (not thick) gravy.  The mac & cheese was a highlight too...definitely grab that if you stop by.  Unfortunately they were out of the vanilla bourbon sweet potato pie, so we'll just have to make a trip back when in Charlotte.  The service was great and the prices very affordable (both our entrees were around $8.50).  The chicken & dumplings looked pretty fab as well.  They have a pretty decent beer & wine list also.    Definitely stop by if you're in need of some comfort food when in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Here's the dish on Dish: it's Southern comfort food, served with a Bohemian twist. Other Yelpers have pegged it correctly: from the deviled egg and homemade biscuit served on the side, to the Cajun meatloaf, Dish delivers fare like it's made in Momma's kitchen. I've taken friends and elderly (yes, as in really old) relatives to this neighborhood joint, and I've found that Dish has something to please most everyone. I must admit I am extremely partial to one menu item I haven't seen mentioned here. Don't laugh, either, 'cause this stuff rivals the fancy-schmancy stuff you'd find at a much pricier bistro. It is Dish's grilled chicken livers. Served with a side of homemade honey-mustard sauce, these babies are lightly grilled- moist, slightly peppery, and absolutely yummy. It's okay if you pass, it'll leave more for me.  One other thing about Dish: if you want a restaurant that exemplifies the \"hip\" part of Charlotte, Dish is my top pick. Like most of Plaza-Midwood, it is deliberately un-class conscious, playful, and iconoclastic. Old timers will think its flea-market decor looks homey, while hipsters will groove on the kitschy paint-by-numbers art and grandma's attic souvenir plate collection. Add to that a back patio festooned with pink flamingo lights and you have something like trailer-trash art to admire while you enjoy your meal.  DIsh is unpretentious comfort food served with a stud-in-tongue-in-cheek attitude. If you \"get it,\" or even if you don't, I think Dish serves up a mighty fine dining experience.",

    "text": "I visited Dish on the saturday before Easter (April 7th) at the insistence of a former co-worker.  She had dined at Dish a couple times before and raved about their veggie plate.  As someone who has grown up eating southern comfort food (i.e., macaroni&cheese, cornbread, meatloaf, chicken&dumplings, etc), I wasn't really interested in trying any of those dishes because I know I can get the real deal at home or at my grandma's.  I was part of a group of eight dining, Dish makes sure that the entire party is together before they will allow you to be seated, so we started off at the bar. I ordered a fruity drink called 'gaybreeze' ($6) to pass the time. It was fruity and delicious (not too strong!) and the bartender served me promptly.  After about 20 minutes, the entire party was available so we were seated. Incidentally, I was expecting Dish to be quite busy (because it was saturday evening after 7p.m.) but it wasn't. I decided on trying something that I wouldn't ordinarily get at home (or any other relatives' home) and that was the BLT with fried green tomatoes with vegetable soup.  I was a bit disappointed for a couple reasons: (1) the BLT had a barely-there slice of fried green tomato and was stacked with bacon slices (2) the serving of vegetable soup took no more than five spoonfuls to finish. very, very small serving of soup.  I would only recommend this place if you've never had southern comfort food at all. The only reason that I can grasp why this place has any 'hype' is because it was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.  But if you want GOOD southern food, I'd recommend Mert's Heart & Soul in uptown.",

Their meatloaf sliders are juicy, cheesy, hearty... just a really solid appetizer to warm up for the main course. And I could eat at least a dozen of their deviled eggs, simply made, but they perfect the little things like that at Dish. A very strong 1-2 lead-up to the entree.  And their entrees don't disappoint. Chicken and dumplings, meatloaf, salmon patties, really whatever you order, odds are it's going to be on point. Heaping portions that are rich enough to induce a food coma by the time you leave, but it's worth the journey. I've always had an awesome dinner at Dish, and leftovers for the morning. If you can find a parking spot in this crowded area of Plaza-Midwood, you won't regret the journey!",

The prices online are cheaper than the actual prices in-store, which was slightly frustrating.    My girlfriend was planning on ordering Shrimp & Grits, online it was $12.39, but in store on the menu it was $15.99.  She ended up ordering the Special Flounder & Grits, which she was not happy with.  The grits were plain and unseasoned.  The flounder was fried and fine, but nothing spectacular and also came with an order of black beans.. again nothing spectacular.  Our daughter ordered a hamburger, which was also unseasoned and plain.. nothing spectacular for the price.  I ordered the veggie plate, which I liked because they tasted exactly how I would prepare them myself.  Got the collard greens, sweet potato mash, and mac & cheese.  Initially, I ordered the cauliflower, but did not like it at all and traded it for the mac & cheese.  Also, got a deviled egg which was good and a biscuit, which somebody in my family ate.. so it must have been pretty good.    Prices were kind of high considering portion sizes, but I do like how the ingredients are locally sourced and most of the menu is vegetarian friendly.. the vegetables are prepared vegan, instead of with ham hock or smoked turkey.  I would possibly go back..",

    "text": "In Charlotte for a conference. Asked the woman at the front desk of the hotel, \"Where would you recommend as a restaurant to get local tastes or something authentically southern?\" She says,\"My favorite restaurant is Vietnamese.\"  Bahahahaha! I said,\"So how about your second choice?\"  She directed to this place called The Dish. Said it was authentic southern cooking and there was an episode of Diners, Drive-ins & Dives a few years ago where this place was featured. You've now peaked my interest...  This place is not fancy but food was great! The waitress was a bit impatient as there were three of us in the party, asked a lot of questions and we wee not really in a hurry anyways.  Started off with appetizers of Fried Green Tomatoes and Potato Poppers. They Fried Tomatoes were good, as expected, and the Poppers were very different. Potato Poppers = deep fried mashed potato balls.  Our dinners were very good! I chose a Cajun Meatloaf with mashed potatoes and collard greens. There was a bottle of pepper vinegar that was suggested for my greens. It was a bit spicy, but different, and right up my alley!  Other meals chosen with the party was Chicken and Dumplings and Shrimp and Grits. Both of them looked good too!  All entrees served with a deviled egg and biscuit. You could get 3 more deviled eggs if you choose them as one of your sides!   Was a good meal,!",

    "text": "Stopped in for lunch in between brewery visits on a day pouring with rain. Got there a little after typical lunch hours and there were empty tables. Walked in and a girl behind the counter doesn't pick her head up from whatever it was she was doing and says \"someone will be with you in a minute\" OK I'm fine with that, another young lady comes up with a big smile I tell her there are 3 for lunch but the rest are out parking the car, she says \"you're the next table\" cool no wait. I step outside to see if the car is parked, don't see the rest of my party, step back inside and guess what??? the girl at the counter says..again \"someone will be with you in a minute\" and again never picks her head up. One of my party comes in I go to meet her as she comes inside and ...yep 3rd time...\"someone will be with you in a minute \"what?????? now I'm thinking it's rude. The smiling happy young lady comes over as the rest of my party comes and seats us. Another young girl is our server, she asks if we want anything to drink, the people I'm with say \"just water\" she brings 2 waters and I ask if I could have water too, she says \"so you want a drink?\" I told her I thought she meant a drink..drink..or coffee. So now she says again \"so you do want a drink\" I just say yes please a water...again what is going on???? We order our food, very good. This place could have gotten 5 stars if we had gotten better service. Tried the fried green tomatos and in honor of my Gmother on my Dad's side chicken and dumplings. The food is better than the service. Because of the service I don't think I'd go back sorry to say.",

    "text": "I've been to Dish for both dinner and breakfast, and I have to say I prefer them for breakfast.  The prices are very reasonable for how much food you get, and I enjoy the laid-back atmosphere and 60s and 70s music during breakfast.   Dinner gets 3.5 stars.  The black eyed pea hummus is an interesting concept, but the hummus was too thick to be able to scoop it out of the bowl with just a pita wedge - a fork was definitely needed here!  It was also very filling.  Their chicken and dumplings (made famous from an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives) could have used more dumplings and less chicken.  (I know, I'm probably the only person who would think that.)  The gravy was quite thick, and I am not a fan of dark meat, so I probably won't get it again.  Their mac 'n cheese was quite good, though, as were their biscuits and deviled eggs.    My hubby is a real fan of salmon patties, and he liked their version.  He also enjoyed their collards and squash casserole.  Their breakfast is a real bargain, and they have become one of our favorite places for Saturday breakfast, so they deserve 5 stars for this meal.  I always get the Downhome breakfast served with eggs, hash brown casserole or grits, bacon, sausage, or soy sausage, biscuit, and tea or coffee.  Everything is always good, and the hash brown casserole is really unique and tasty (it's made with cream and cheddar cheeses, onions, and it's yummy!).  And all this is just $5!    My hubby usually gets the Carolina Country breakfast, which has BOTH grits and the hash brown casserole, and also a bowl of pepper gravy for $6.50.  The gravy is peppery, just the right consistency, and really good on the biscuit and eggs.  You'll usually see Yolanda at breakfast, and she's one of our all-time favorite servers.  She always has a smile, she remembers your order if you are a regular, and when she has control of the music, you are guaranteed a great start to your day.  The coffee is even strong enough to satisfy us.  Service is also usually quick and attentive.  I only wish they would open earlier than 10am for breakfast!",

    "text": "This place is really great. One night after leaving school with a friend (both culinary students) we decided we wanted some soul food. So the place that got great reviews was Dish, I'm not a huge fan of these southern restaurants popping up all over Charlotte but hey, we're in the south, what can you do? So Dish caught our eye and as we walked into the little yellow building we were brought straight back to grandmas Alabama kitchen, where the food is fresh, southern and fattening. We started with the fried green tomatoes (how could you not? My fave) and they were so good. The horseradish sauce that came with it complimented the tomatoes very well. I ordered the chicken and dumplings (one of the more expensive things on the menu and it's still under 10 bucks, love that!). I paired the dumplings with Mac and cheese, and it comes with a biscuit and a deviled egg (hello). My friend got the country fried steak, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes and a biscuit with egg.   The biscuits were amazing. Hard and buttery on the outside but fluffy and flavorful on the inside. Amazing. Really!  The egg was your traditional deviled egg, pretty good and a nice add on.   The dumplings were amazing, tasted like the ones my grandma make (wish they would add veggies to it)   The country fried steak was great and her two sides were awesome (carb overload but so worth it)   They have almost anything you could want from a southern kitchen, and the sides list has every southern food you can think of. On the back of the menu is sandwiches and even those looked awesome (want to try the chicken pesto). All In all I give the service, food and ambiance 4 stars. For the price, the portions are great, and the food was pretty good but could use some seasoning, other than that this place is awesome.",

Place was full of people of all ages (lots of families) and casual.  We ordered fried green tomatoes, buffalo chicken salad, and Cajun meatloaf.  Food was plentiful and served quickly.  We really liked the fried green tomatoes and biscuits.  The salad was good; however, the blue cheese was excessive.  The meatloaf was ok, but I wasn't as impressed as I thought it would be given the other reviews.  Liked the place and would return.  Good food for a reasonable price.  Go Charlotte good scene...",

    "text": "I am not a fan, but I am not a hater either.  I fall smack inbetween.  My first impressions were not that favorable.  We walked in on a rainy Friday night and there was no structure to the entrance/hostess area.  Busy waitresses kept buzzing past us, no one greeted us for a solid 3 minutes (which is a long time to be standing in awkward land) and we weren't sure who to even tell we were looking for a table!  Finally someone came around and asked us if we wanted to be seated and immediately walked us to our table.    This place definitely has a cool 'local\" flare to it and while there is nothing fancy about the decor, it does have a certain comforting aspect to it.  The menu was what I expected, southern style options and the prices were very reasonable.    I ordered the veggie plate and it was okay--a little bland but the sweet potatoes were pretty good!  The squash casserole was decent but mushy and didn't have a ton of flavor.  The black beans were pretty much gross and the biscuit wasn't anything more than a pillsbury dough biscuit from Harris Teeter.  We tried the Pimento Cheese and I have had better.  Husband got the burger, which wasn't made to order and was a pretty small patty but it was ok.  Again, nothing to rush back for.  The waitress was very friendly, the food came out pretty quickly and the overall experience was decent.  I just wouldn't make a habit of returning to Dish.  I love the location, I love the vibe and I love the prices...but I didn't leave fully satisfied from the meal.",

    "text": "Came here on Saturday for the first time! Great food and amazing prices!  We all ordered beers....they were pretty well priced. I got the Old Meck Seasonal and I think it was like $4 or so.   We ordered the pimento dip appetizer. It came with half tortillas chips and half pita chips. I thought this was good but, honestly, there was so much for for the meal that we could have done without it.  I ordered the three veggie plate with collards, mashed potatoes, and squash. The collards were perfection....especially with some added vinegar on top. The mashed potatoes were great. The squash was a little bit of a downfall....not seasoned at all and was super rubbery. Guess that's what I get for trying to order slightly healthy.   However, my husbands order was by far the best. He ordered the cajun meatloaf with mac and cheese as a side. OMG.....so good....I kinda kept reaching over when he wasn't looking just to get more. The sauce on top of the meatloaf was amazing and it was obvious I should have ordered mac and cheese instead of the squash.   My husband grabbed the tab for us and another couple with us and for the 4 of us (all with beers), it was like $45! Will definitely be back.  Side Note: We did have one service issue that didnt really rub any of us the right way. When I got my meal, they accidently brought out mac and cheese instead of the collards. Normally, I would just eat it (duh, it's mac and cheese) but I am a southern girl through and through and I LOVE my collards. So I told the waitress about the mixup. When she brought my collards out, she asked for the mac and cheese back. It was odd passing a bowl of mac and cheese across the table to her. Especially because we all knew that she was going to take it back and throw it <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Faway.It&s=d960a7fec32dd71c5cf951aae91abf69efcb61dc6dacbcefa443d88c6f33488e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">away.It</a> wasnt a huge deal but was just kinda weird and totally inappropriate for the situation.",

It doesn't matter what I'm in the mood for, there's something on the menu to satisfy my craving. Pile o' mac'n'cheese and some collards? Check. Awesome tomato soup and grilled pimento cheese? Yup.

I should also preface this with saying that I am a vegetarian so perhaps that has my vision of here a little off.  When we first walked in I was already turned off, I mean I know it's a diner and I totally support that but it was not a very 'inviting' atmosphere to me. Luckily it was nice out so we were able to sit on the patio, we had the place basically to ourselves. Our waitress was ok, but was pretty boring honestly. She wasn't rude or inattentive just didn't seem like the happiest person.  We had the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer and there was barely any tomato, just the corn meal crust. I had the veggie burrito and was less than impressed, it wasn't terrible just extremely bland and nothing special. It doesn't come with a side but it was more than enough to fill you up. My husband got the veggie burger topped with pimento cheese and a side of potato salad, again nothing special. I tried it and it was ok but not something I would ever want again given the choice.",

On the posted menu, most of the items allow for two sides, but the actual menu allows for only one.  To get another side runs almost $3 each, a little pricy.  Also, went to the restroom as we were leaving.  It has a large handicap sign on the door, an indication that it is handicap accessible.  While the size of the room is adequate, the toilet is very low to the floor.  As a handicapped person, it was difficult to get up, as the toilet is not ADA compliant.   The restaurant is located in a section of town frequented by the millennial crowd, so I found it to be a little loud for my taste.  All in all, a reasonably good  restaurant, but not one that I would go back to.  Parking was not easy to work with, either.  The negatives outweighed the positives.",

About two pm I was getting hungry and saw several people coming out of nondescript restaurant called Dish. I asked them if it was a good place to eat and they said it was great. They live 40 minutes away and always eat here when there in town. I decided to try it. It was quite busy for the time of day and it was on a Tuesday. The waitress was very attentive and recommended several dishes. We had the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer. I've never had them before but they were amazing. I loved the sweet mashed potatoes. If you like a little spice the meatloaf is great. Good sized proportions and really reasonable prices. I would highly recommend the Dish.",

The Deviled Eggs were a bit disappointing.  Not bad, but compared to every thing else, they tasted like an after-thought that had been hanging around for a while.    We were told all the deserts are homemade so we got the Vanilla Bourbon Sweet Potato Pie to go.  It was a little on the sweet side, but very, very good.  The service was efficient & friendly.

I got lucky in that I was brought here first.  I guess I'll start with the bad. Parking sucks. But it's in Plaza Midwood so I don't know how exactly anyone could fix this.  Every time I come into Dish the host and service are absolutely top notch. I've come in 30 minutes before close (about when you'll start getting spit in your food) and the kitchen was still humming along and we were served quickly with a hot meal.  You really can't go wrong. The mexican food is a little idiosyncratic but my friends tell me it's amazing. The meatloaf sliders are PERFECT as an appetizer, and fried green tomatoes are fantastic as well. Greens and mashed potatoes and mac + cheese are all top notch. I've had the fried steak and fried chicken.  The biggest thing about Dish even after all the great service in food is that when you leave you're satisfied. The prices and portions are perfect balanced to where I don't feel like I've been ripped off. It's comfort food so in no way shape or form should you depend on Dish to help you keep your diet, but I also don't feel totally disgusting and bloated afterward either which is a feat in itself.  Grats dish. You have a lifetime customer.",

I drive by that place at least twice a day and have seen the Guy Fierie show at least 5 times. How have I never been there?!) Dish was one such place until last week...   Upon review of the menu I was totally overwhelmed by all the tasty sounding options. BLTs! Cajun Meatloaf! Quesadillas! Curry Chicken Salad! All the amazing sides caught my eye in the end and I decided to go with a True southern classic, the \"veggie plate.\" I selected smoky limas (my favorite), mac & cheese (delish), collards (sweet and savory) and green beans (above average but put to shame by the other 3). As if all that wasn't enough, the veggie plate is accompanied by a biscuit and deviled egg. I gave my egg away -- I don't do hard boiled eggs, bleh -- but can speak to the biscuit which was one of the best I've ever had, lightly coated with honey.   Everything my friends ordered looked equally tasty and fresh. Service was spot on, friendly and attentive. Prices are super affordable. All in all, Dish is a great little spot that is sure to be on my lunch rotation from here on out. I just can't believe it took me this long to discover it!",

Everything from their Cajun meatloaf to the country-fried steak is delicious, and will leave you happy and full.

A little down home, southern place with lots of hospitality. I will not be returning here, but I would recommend trying this place out just for the experience.",

    "text": "Very pleasantly surprised how much my wife and I enjoyed this place. At first, we came in the place was packed and no one was there to greet us.   Oddly enough, the kitchen window was right next to us and the kitchen started to say hi and talk to us. NOTE: they were extremely busy and hopping around but still made it a point to greet us....  Very quickly, the server came back the told us we will be helped shortly, And sure enough with minute wait, we were sat at our table. The Server was fast, friendly and helpful.   The Skinny: My wife got the Fried Green Tomatoes. I wasn't excited since I am not a huge fan nor a little fan of tomatoes... but I like ketchup. So, I must say and with my wife pushing me, I tried a little piece... well I almost ate half the appetizer with her. : )  The Chicken & Dumplings were pretty dang good, there are so many takes and interpretations of this dish. Regardless, this version was delicious. My wife tried the Country Fried Steak which was really good too...   Was this my favorite southern food, no. I still love my mom's. But the cooks understand quality and seasoning, it is refreshing to go to a place that just gets it right when respecting the food as oppose to using gimmicks and flare to get success.....",

    "text": "So, Dish has been on my list for years, almost as long as 10 years, and I finally made it this past weekend.  And, to be honest, I only wanted to go there for the Chicken and Dumplings, which SO many people have raved about it. So, we stopped in Saturday afternoon and were seated inside on the upper level.  I was a little surprised at how casual and laid back the place was..I guess I am not sure what I expected. Needless to say I asked if I could get a cup of Chicken and Dumplings, no, only comes in a bowl, bummer.  Knowing it was heavy I was hesitate to order an entire bowl. After being persuaded, and reminded this was the reason I came, I ordered the Chicken and Dumplings with Lima Beans.  My friend ordered the Fried Egg and Bason sandwich, and asked for it on a croissant, which we found out was a $1.50 up charge.  Didn't realize that until the bill came.  Needless to say while we waited for our food we hit the Bloody Mary Bar...which I am not too sure I would call it a bar. On a high rise table they had celery salt, worsterchire, tabasco, and a few other seasonings and a ice box with celery, olives and onions. No bacon, shrimp, or anything other fun Bloody Mary bar treats.  The Bloody Marys were good though, and only $5.00. Our food arrived quickly which was nice. My meal came with a biscuit and deviled egg, which I would not bother to add as they weren't that great. My biscuit was hard so I just dove in the Chicken and Dumplings, which was great. The chicken was so moist and the dumplings were really good.  It was worth it for that bowl!  The Egg and Bacon sadwich got great reviews as well and their croissants are homemade so my friend loved.  Overall, I am glad I made a visit to Dish, but not sure I would rush back or keep this on my go to list, especially in the Midwood area with so many other great options around.",

    "text": "Dish is one of those restaurants where everything about the place seems fantastic except for the food, which didn't quite measure up.    It's housed in brick bunker of a building in the middle of Plaza-Midwood.  From the outside, it looks like it might have once been an old-school R&B club:  low-slung, with few windows.  Instead, though, it's colorful, homey, comfortable, and spacious.  (There was some early '80s R&B on the sound system.)  Demographically, it's got about as much variety as you could imagine for a down-home diner:  Just during a single lunch here, there was old, young, white, African-American, LGBT, white collar, blue collar, you name it.  (In general, what I want from city life.)  Service was friendly and attentive, with plenty of iced-tea refillings.  (Not surprisingly, Dish was once on Guy Fieri's show; I didn't realize this until I noticed that the black velvet painting above our table had some kind of \"Guy Was Here\" stencil spray-painted onto it, with the instantly recognizable goatee, shades, and preposterous hair.)    Alas, the food, although pretty good, didn't quite measure up to everything else about Dish.  \"Cajun\" meatloaf didn't have too much punch (nor did it seem to have all that much meat or Cajun flavor), and the same went for the mashed potatoes that came with it.  Collard greens were chopped really rough, the way I like them, but they had a strange, slightly sweet flavor that I didn't much care for.    The menu's really large and varied, so there's definitely something for everyone here, and maybe there are some items that are quite a bit better than what I had.  There are also many, many alcohol choices, FWIW.  A very satisfying lunch experience--reasonably priced for the quantity--despite my not being knocked out by the food.",

    "text": "I am in disbelief after reading some of the other reviews. I am actually upset with myself that it took eight years of living in Charlotte to go to Dish. I feel that I have missed out on the southern style cooking that they provide. After eating there I honestly felt welcomed into the south. It was amazing. The other reviews stating that the food was bland is surprising. The food I got was full of flavor.   We ordered the meatloaf sliders to start, and for our entrees we order the chicken fried steak and the chicken and dumplings. The only mishap is that we did not receive the sliders until after our entrees arrived. They were busy and they did apologize for the mistake immediately and notified us that they were not going to charge us for them. I was not upset with them over this and it did not affect our experience.  There was not a lot of meat loaf in the sliders, but they were still very good and flavorful. The chicken fried steak was perfectly cooked. It was crispy on the outside, yet still very tender. It was topped with a white gravy over a bed of mashed potatoes. Both the gravy and mash potatoes were tasty. I did not feel that there was too much butter, which is some times typical to southern cooking.   The chicken and dumplings were also very tasty. It did taste similar to the gravy that was on the chicken fried steak but also tasted slightly different at the same time. It was very good and was filled with large pieces of chicken and huge dumplings. The dumplings were super moist but not to the point where they were soggy and soft. We ordered mac and cheese for the side. The mac and cheese was very good, it wasn't anything overly incredible, but was satisfying.  Both meals came with a biscuit. I am not a big biscuit fan. Never grew up eating biscuits but I have had my share of biscuits since moving to Charlotte. These biscuits were by far the best I have ever had. They were so fresh, soft, moist, flaky. I wanted to order another one for dessert.  For what we got, I felt that the pricing was fantastic and actually on the cheap side. The majority of the apps are around $5 and the entrees were around $8. Sandwiches on the menu were between $5-$8. For two people, one appetizer, two entrees and four beers the tab was about $30. I do not know of many other places in Charlotte that I could of received a meal like that for that kind of money.",

The deviled eggs had turned dark on top from not being covered in the fridge and were very bland. Biscuits  were hard and cold. Green beans have no taste whatsoever.

So last night's dinner at Dish easily qualifies as the best meal I've had in Charlotte under $10.  A perfectly fried country fried steak over a bed of made-from-scratch mashers, a deviled egg, and a ridiculously buttery biscuit... Yup.  Oh yea, and one extra side of choice.  For $7.99?

The horseradish dip was an excellent complement for it.   I then had to try the chicken and biscuits. Perfectly scrumptious. Tastes like someone just cooked it up as did everything. It came with a yummy biscuit and deviled egg. I chose the honey carrots as the side. All outstanding. It tasted like a home cooked meal that your mom or grandma would make. Amazing.   Also the prices are so low. I can't believe what a great place this is. I can see how they were featured on Food Network because the food was delicious. What a gem to find this. Thank you!",

I went with the chicken and dumplings.  Great!  This was a late lunch (1pm) and I was stuffed.  I started with a cup of potato soup which was also tasty.  My wife had the veggie burger, which she said was okay.  The place is small, very bohemian wait staff (piercingly, tats, etc).  It was crowded though and really seems to be a local favorite.  Lots of awards on the wall.  They have a full bar too in the back of the restaurant.  Prices were very reasonable.  I think my chicken and dumplings (included two sides) was $8.",

Atmosphere is super cozy and decor is eclectic and cute. Back dining room and bar area features local artists' work on display (big ups to that!).  My favorite dish to get at Dish is the veggie plate! Great selection of vegetarian friendly southern sides. I recommend the squash casserole over anything, but also highly enjoy: smokey lima beans, collard greens, mashed potatoes, and mac n cheese. Plates are served with deviled egg and the best homemade biscuit you'll ever have.   If ordering an appetizer, make sure you check out the fried green tomatoes... they are to die for. Served with a dill dipping sauce that will blow your mind.",

So I got a pulled chicken pesto wrap...the chicken was under done..I tried two different pieces...inconsistently cooked throughout...but I do not believe safe...I did not eat it...told the waitress, she took the plate with the clearly uneaten meal, basically called me a liar and said there is no way it could be undercooked, then charged me for it anyway. My husband ordered chips as a side to go with his veggie burger.., we expected restaurant quality, maybe even homemade...but they were pieces of ruffles out of a bag...another group at the table next to us got the wrong order and the waitress said well I can't read my own handwriting..,what?!...and on 3 different occasions there were attempts at delivering someone else's food to our table. A couple of years ago the food was good and the service was decent (never great)...today a total disaster...very disappointed...there are plenty of other options in the area... try Zada Janes instead!",

    "text": "I've given them two tries to impress me.  Both times they failed.  First time in I tried their most expensive entree, shrimp and grits, a Southern staple.  The shrimp were okay but the grits and the odd mix of herbs or whatever was supposedly in the grits was very nondescript and practically tasteless; basically just unseasoned white grits with 6 shrimp thrown on top.  Definitely not worth the price.  Second trip; I never judge a restaurant based on one trip unless it's horrible, I ordered a hamburger, a simple staple anywhere.  I figured with their rep they certainly wouldn't screw it up but I was wrong.  I ordered the burger with Swiss and grilled onions.  I got a 5 ounce paddy, very dry and well done, obviously cooked earlier that day, not to order.  I asked for medium.  One thin slice of cheese left a thin remnant on top of the burger, and maybe a tablespoon of grilled onions, and 3 thin pickle slices on the side.  Had to ask for mustard instead of the waitress asking me what condiments I preferred.  Overall, not at all the experience one would expect from a place that even Food Network has visited or that charges what they do for food.  So, I won't be back and will opt instead for other more reliable favorites in Charlotte.",

Creamy and onion-y ('throw a mint in that dumpster!' it is my favorite thing on the menu.  Also fantastic are the chicken and dumplings, the biscuits are the best i have ever had, and the perfect accompaniment to the soup is the BLT.    Service is always fast and quick.

We had to wait about 5 minutes for a table, of which we were seated in the corner (after several tables / booths were open). Ok, I get it, I know about the waiter / waitress rotation.  Well, after sitting 5 more minutes, we were passed over by a teenage / early 20s waiter who clearly was helping all his tables, just not ours.  Finally, a manager came over & got our drink order (& our food order, since we were prepared). So we sat & sat & sat...STILL waiting to get acknowledged by our waiter.   Wait...  Wait...  Wait...  It took our food about 20 minutes to come out...SERIOUSLY?! I got salmon cakes & macaroni & cheese & deviled eggs.  My boyfriend got the pork chops.  I have NO idea why it took so long.  The food was horrible. I hardly ate any of it.   STILL no acknowledgement from our waiter or anyone else for that matter.  Finally, I had to go back this manager & ask for our bill so we could pay & get the heck out of there.    Oh, guess who finally decided to show his face? ...yeah, our waiter.   I went & told the manager what happened & he just kind of shrugged & said he was sorry.   Will I give Dish another chance?  Nope.",

It is Southern, home style, everyone will find something on the menu and the atmosphere is relaxed.

They also have really good quesadilla's (or \"Mexican pizza\" as my brother in law calls it). Everyone loves their Cajun meatloaf.  And, always, the deviled egg.  There is usually local art on the walls. There is outdoor seating.  They do have a breakfast (I think Saturday). HOLY CRAP it is fatty, but really delicious (there is some sort of hash brown casserole that is INSANE)  I don't go here on a regular basis. I think I would easily gain 20 lbs if I did. If you are hankering home cooked food though- this is the place to go.  I have noticed that the Dish has been a little inconsistent over the pass few years. I remember in 2005 it was ALWAYS GOOD.

There's always a huge anticipation with me and southern food... maybe because I grew up a little (more) north, so my discovery of the goodness was much later and always gives me that same feeling of dread and awesomeness every time I think about it.  My last visit, I had the cajun meatloaf.... the portion was gi-normous and I ate the entire thing (my mouth could not chew any faster).  Deviled eggs are one of my weaknesses in life.... good thing they are a side option item on the menu!  Great location, right in the heart of things off of Thomas Street.

They were had some skins in the them, and they had great potato flavor (I can't think of a better way to describe them).  The entrees come with their deviled eggs, which are quite good (if you like them).  The next visit I had the fried green tomatoes, and I am told the horseradish dill is some of the best sauce to dip them in.  My last visit, I had the shrimp and grits, which have the potential to be completely wonderful.  The grits themselves were a little bland, but the shrimp, sausage, and sauce were all wonderful.  I've also had the chocolate pecan pie for dessert, which was yummy.    The decorating theme here is country dinner/industrial, which is an interesting combination.  The decor is quite eclectic, but it's warm and inviting.  The service has always been pretty good here.  If you're looking for a bit of comfort, I highly recommend this place.",

I mean look, it's a simple location, a diner, by all traits.  It's not Johnny Rockets diner, it's the corner, hole in the wall diner, that you bring a girlfriend, wife, or someone you care about, for food that you wished your mom cooked every day for you.    In a bowl of warmth, you find yourself knee deep in Tomato Soup, a creamy, buttery, tangy, gritty all-in-one smart dish. Served with a buttermilk biscuit, brushed with butter, you can't ask for more for a starter.  The Chicken and Dumplings is that little slice of goodness, it's like the stuff your mother decided, to reward herself, but thought you might like it also.  The chicken was tender, and the dumplings were nicely done.  The Mac and Cheese, was the kind you find in Southern Cooking.  It's not the creamy kind you find in the fridge section, but the made-by-some-person-in-your-kitchen-sensibility and taste.  You may want some crazy cheese sauce, but this is the kind that makes you realize, they make it the way you make it at home, but just a little bit better.   Okay, I'm not from the south, but I have been to every state in the US.  There are great foods out there, and really, this places shows that you don't have to execute gastro-etymology, to show case, the simple home like flavors that make this place a must visit.",

The most popular items are the chicken and dumplings, the Cajun meatloaf and the shrimp and grits and you can't go wrong with any. Our table of 5 had all 3 of those along with the Reuben special and the buffalo chicken salad. Everybody walked out happy.",

    "text": "I have to be upfront about my 5-Star rating: it's heavily influenced by my nostalgic feelings for Dish.  When I first moved to Charlotte, broke and homesick, a friend brought me to Dish. The only thing I could afford was their tomato soup and a biscuit... but that was all I needed. LORD! It was so good!   Also good are the salmon patties (I suggest getting mashed sweet potatoes and Lima beans on the side), their pot roast, deviled eggs (most dishes come with one as a side but order extras!), and chicken salad. The only item I've tried that didn't really do it for me was the chicken and dumplings.   Service is good enough, very casual and sometimes I've waited longer than I should've for my check. But they're good people. The decor is like my gramma's kitchen so I basically wish I could live there. All in all it's a cozy little place. I've seen Plaza Midwood change so drastically in my 12 years in Charlotte. Dish has managed to stick around and I hope it does for many, many more years.",

Before going I checked out other reviews up here & it seems like every food item has very mixed reviews so it didn't make my decision easy looking for what to try. He likes the chicken and dumplings so I decided to give it a try as well and I got collards as the side. It also comes with a deviled egg and honey butter biscuit. The chicken & dumplings were pretty good and is the only reason I would give the place a 2.5. The collards I took a small bite & that was enough because they didn't taste good at all. The deviled egg was very bland so I only had a bite of it and the biscuit was hard. Service was mediocre.",

Service was a bit slow getting our drink and food orders.  But the food arrived quickly and was amazingly good!  Everything we ordered was good with impressive serving sizes.  It truly stood up to the reviews we had seen.  Looks like they even have a Bloody Mary Bar!  Wish I had seen that before we ordered.  I felt like their prices were reasonable as well for the quality and quantity.  My favorite was the fried green tomatoes with the pimento cheese dip & Deviled Eggs.  Several ordered chicken and dumplings and it was very flavorful and hearty! I ordered the Blackened Chicken Breast though I wanted to try the Maple Balsamic Pork Chops but was watching my WW points!  It was satisfying  and flavorful as well.  Side dishes all were good and felt like I was eating my grandmother's...  All-in-all, no disappointment with the food at all!",

My husband and I came here for dinner and we started with the fried green tomatoes. They were served with a horseradish dill dipping sauce and were a signature item. They really had no flavor and I didn't care for the horseradish dip. We ended up ordering a side of ranch, because well, it's ranch- duh! It makes everything taste good.   For my main dish I got the salmon patties with sweet potatoes and carrots. The patties were served with an amazing orange butter that I also put on my biscuit (which was awesome), but I was let down by the salmon patties. They looked and tasted like canned salmon and had a lot of filling rather than salmon in them. I couldn't finish them. The sides were also bland. Nothing special to them.   However, I loved the deviled egg that came with the meal and my husband's chicken and dumplings were great. I think I ate more of his meal than mine. There were other dishes on the menu that I was debating from so I'll definitely be back for the shrimp and grits or the Cajun meatloaf.",

    "text": "We went here for a late lunch (around 1:45-2). We were greeted as soon as we walked in, and host gave us menus and told us we could sit anywhere. It wasn't busy. At all. Within a minute or so, a server came up and took our drink order (I don't think she introduced herself). Once the food came, she came up and asked if we needed anything else. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich drenched in buffalo sauce and a side of collards. The sandwich looked awesome! It was not bad, but I don't think I would order it again. The buffalo sauce was thin so it was just dripping off of the sandwich. And the collards did not taste good (at least to me) - but I'm not going to take anything off for the collards because I have only had them a handful of times in my life. Anyways, we were almost done when she checked on us again. And when we were done we were just sitting there waiting. And waiting. And waiting. She was behind the countertop just on her phone the whole time. Eventually we didn't want to wait anymore so we asked her for the check at the counter.   I have been here before, several times, but not in the last year. I usually have no problem; their servers are usually on top of everything and always so friendly. But this time felt different... I always get the shrimp & grits, but today we all got something we never had before and I regret the decision.   I will probably come back, and if I do I will get the shrimp & grits.",

They should market this stuff. It is what \"I\" would make IF \"I\" went to the effort of grinding sharp cheddar cheese through a meat grinder. Their pimento cheese was so good when we had our company Christmas lunch at Dish, that we almost fought over the stuff. It was equally as good tonight. Good Job!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dish-charlotte?select=zC0ICeQYyG--Ls2EXaWjCw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dish...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dish-charlotte?select=l6RMXmTzpIS9pZSj15ZVAQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dish...</a>  ** Pot Roast: 3/5. Okay, tasty, a little fatty. I was expecting a larger portion for $13. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dish-charlotte?select=Orr6SwW8k09q8D2UehE2Fw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dish...</a>  ** Mashed Potatoes w/Gravy. 3.5/5. They left the skin on, which I like. This paired well the meat, but I would like to be able to choose my own sides, thank you.   ** Collard Greens. 4/5. Good, sweet, rustic. Well done. The pot likker was delicious, but I didn't stumble across any pieces of ham hocks. (Can one be a collard green snob? Maybe, I am. LOL)  ** Biscuit. 3/5.  Who puts honey on the \"outside\" of a biscuit? It just makes the darned thing sticky and messy. Everyone knows, well not the people at Dish - but everyone else, knows that butter and honey go on the INSIDE of a biscuit. You're welcome.  ** Deviled Egg. 1/5. A pitiful example of one of my favorite egg dishes. Cold and lacking in any taste whatsoever. No love or attention was put into this food item. Lowe's Supermarket has MUCH better deviled eggs in their deli. My mother made better deviled eggs.....and so do I, there's no comparison.   ** Bloody Mary. 3/5. Tasty and spicy, but the glass was about 80% ice to monetize the drink. Those Bastids. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dish-charlotte?select=UAq8RfqQUtrvA_1AH-KPRA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/dish...</a>  ** Service? 1/5. (see below)  The maitre'd gave me lip about wanting to sit at a booth, in a basically empty (5 p.m.) restaurant - not a good start. If I'm paying $30+ dollars for a meal, I sit where I like, thank you.   I had a passive/aggressive waitress that I damn near wanted to strangle by evening's end. She didn't tell me the specials, because she probably didn't know what they were. Another blue haired hipster waitress at an adjacent table didn't know what they were either, when a foursome of diners asked - and THAT waitress was far better than the one that I endured.   My waitress actually gave me grief about not ordering dessert, when I had already had an appetizer, a mixed drink, and an entree. She gave me grief about bringing a to go box for the remains of my pimento cheese app.   What REALLY ticked me off was when I was ready to leave. Said waitress took my credit card......and then she didn't return for what seemed an eternity. When I looked around, she was taking other people's orders, wrapping silverware, busing tables, delivering to go boxes, etc., with no apparent hurry to bring back my ticket to sign....so I could get the heck out of Dodge. She seemed to be trying to do everything at once, which resulted in her doing everything haphazardly.   After a good fifteen to twenty minutes of waiting, I was ready to YELL from frustration. No, seriously, I almost lost it. A nice meal was basically ruined by a disorganized waitress.   In summary: The food is good. Some food items are priced a little too high. The pot roast was $13, which was effing ridiculous considering the portion was not \"that\" large. (I think that they charged me for the entire cut of roast.) The service pretty much sucks. The acoustics are terribly LOUD when the restaurant if full. All of the waitstaff are wannabe hipsters. Parking is difficult. I have no intention of going back again anytime soon, unless someone else wants to go there.   I should have went to Baoding or Bistro La Bon or Midwood Smokehouse or Good Food on Montford. {sigh} Maybe, next time.",

The chicken and dumplings can't be beat, but their veggie plates are equally outstanding and you're provided with ~20 different options to choose from. Creamy tomato soup is textured as opposed to totally blended and smooth, and I think it adds an extra little \"something something\" that makes it stand out against the rest. The deviled egg and biscuit with nearly every meal option are yummy and always appreciated!  One of my favorite spots for southern cooking in Charlotte. Definitely a must-visit.",

    "text": "Dish specializes in Southern\\comfort foods with a \"quirky\" twist. Unfortunately, the quality of the food varies widely. My theory is that if the owner is there, the food's top-notch. But if she's not there, the kitchen slacks off in a really bad way. I've had the chicken & dumplings and thought it was great. I've had it other times and it was borderline awful. The Cajun meatloaf & mashed potatoes can be sublime; or the meatloaf can be greasy and the potatoes lumpy. The shrimp & grits can be absolutely delicious... but it can be nearly tasteless, too. The staff is usually pretty good, and are especially patient with our table (usually tables of 8 or 10), but they can have bad days, too. It's gotten to where I don't want to gamble on Dish when Midwood Smokehouse and The DIamond are in the same neighborhood, and are far more consistent.  EDIT: Since my original review in 2012, Dish has worked out the kinks in their consistency game: I haven't experienced the ups and downs Dish used to have, and none of my friends have mentioned it, either. However, not too long ago Dish decided to remove ALL meat products from their vegetables (so, for example, collard greens are no longer cooked with the traditional ham hock). While I'm sure this is great for vegans, it's really annoyed my \"mostly vegetarian\" girlfriend. She won't eat meat by itself, but if meat is used as a flavoring (like collards), she's fine with it. And now she says that Dish's vegetables are \"tasteless\" and \"bland\". Since all she ever ordered there was the veggie plate, we just don't go there much any more.",

    "text": "Another re-review of one of my fav hood joints. This one not sooo good. First off tried the new brunch on Saturdays, they only serve the eggs 2 ways. fried or scrambled. (at least at that time) We went with my father in-law and he asked for his eggs over medium. The answer from our waitress was \"NO\", not sorry we only are serving eggs this way right now because the kitchen is getting used to it. No, we got a big fat NO. To this day when I go back, and it is frequent (at least once a week) if I ever get her as a server I ask to be moved sections.  Otherwise I echo my previous reviews, Chick & dumplings is great, Cajun meatloaf is hit or miss depending on who made it. I have had it super spicy, and I have had it with no spice (and left disappointed) .  So over all love the place, some servers are iffy, front hostess stand is always chaos when its busy. I have almost gotten in 2 arguments with other patrons because we were sat before them but they had been there longer?? Not my fault, more attention needs to be paid to the front of the restaurant when they get busy. Very rarely do they ever have a wait list, where they take your name, its just kinda done by feel. Which has apparently angered at least 2 regular customers because I was sat before them, to the point where I felt uncomfortable going back to my staple lunch spot for over a month. Again, not my fault.   Fix the front of house, have some sort of wait system when its busy, and I will keep coming back. But I walked out tonight because some preppy older couple decided to pick a fight with me b/c I was attempted to be seated before them.  Again, blame front of house not me. DISH FIX FRONT OF HOUSE STAFF, I LOVE EVERYTHING ELSE!!!  PS. Especially Corey, best waitress in CLT",

    "text": "As a native Californian with 7 years experience in the restaurant industry, some might say my standards for food just might be on the more critical side of the spectrum.   A friend of ours recommended Dish as our first \"locals\" style restaurant recommendation. He's a man of few words: \"Dish is pretty good. Their spicy meatloaf is excellent.\"   We stopped by for dinner and found some parking on the street, but I can see how parking can be hit or miss depending on the time of day and how busy the neighboring places can get.   Dish has an understated exterior, with only a colorful cartoonishly hip logo painted outside and your staple one-word trendy name. The interior is open, bright, and eclectic. Paintings and china plates are displayed on the walls. It is cozy, familiar and conjures childhood memories. The clientele is decidedly hip and young - a quick survey of the folks yielded an Ozomotoli hoodied, bearded guy, surrounded by lean women in 70's blazers and jeans. My impression - not unlike the Silverlake crowd in Southern California, understated, casual cool.   An efficient, friendly, nose-ringed waitress took our order. As prescribed, I stuck with the spicy meatloaf and mashed potatoes. My husband ordered the grits and shrimp. If you're going to eat Southern food, you gotta have some grits. Certain grits dishes can even aspire to the level of \"sophisticated\" cuisine; I was reminded of the well-loved shrimp and grits dish that a former Top Chef contestant whipped up that made me long for taste-o-vision.   Entrees came with a deviled egg and biscuit. While the deviled egg was satisfactory, the biscuit was mundane and a bit cold. What made up for it was the warm, well-balanced shrimp and grits, just enough salty, creamy, cheesy, taste to make you shovel the strangely textured Southern favorite into your mouth and be reduced to caveman-like sounds of affirmation and delight. The spicy meatloaf did not disappoint, an intriguing, subtle heat, slight tart and sweetness and a lovely textured meatloaf that was neither too compacted or too delicate.   Portions were perfect, pricing a good value for a sit-down restaurant that has a local hangout vibe.  My only criticism is the food temperature, which in the cool evening, dropped within minutes causing you to wonder if you could drop into the kitchen and ask to pop the dish just for a sec' into the microwave. The potatoes were a little on the dry side for my tastes, but all in all this was one of the best comfort food meals I've ever enjoyed. Simply put, I have a new-found respect for Charlotte restaurants and Southern comfort food.",

However i wasn't all that hungry, so I decided to try my hand at something simple... I mean real simple. I ordered a Grilled Cheese and tomato sandwich with cheddar and Monterrey with a side of fruit.   Let's see...where do I start?   Once the plate came out I was excited to dig into my sandwich. Although simple, I love grilled cheese and tomato sandwiches, and figured no one can mess this up. Right?.... Wrong.   After I took a bite, I noticed they forgot the tomato. I told the waitress and instead of bringing my sandwich back to actually grill a tomato and cheese sandwich, she brought me a bowl of 4 tomatoes. :-/... Now, my sandwich is grilled. So I had to pry apart the gooey cheese filled sandwich so I can stick a cold slice of tomato in. Smh.  Then! My fruit. How can sliced fruit be bad? Well I'll tell you... It was warm. Why is my fruit warm??? The watermelon looked old, like they gave me the leftovers and they barely gave me any pineapple, which looked old as well. At least the two slices of orange I had were just okay... Again it was warm.   The reasons for two stars?   One for initial service and timeliness.  The second star for the veggie loaf I tried from someone else's plate. It was soooooo good.   Perhaps I'll give this place another try... Clearly staying clear from fruit and grilled cheese.",

This place is as average as they come.  Although, in fairness, the prices are reasonable, so the value is decent.  Surprisingly, the interior was pretty nice and spacious, though. They do not cram you in like most restaurants.   If you want to grab some decent food, cheap, Dish is fine.  I just would not expect anything spectacular.",

Immediately loved the feel of this restaurant. Charming and home-y and my first experience of southern cooking. Due to all of the Yelp photos I had to get the Chicken and Dumplings - thank goodness for pictures because this dish was beyond delicious! My favorite meal growing up, just ridiculously better! And the biscuits... Wow. I could have just eaten those for a meal! I also tried the country fried steak and it was phenomenal.   Our server was extremely friendly and attentive. The prices were very reasonable for the amount of food you received for each dish. I also liked how they had local art hanging around the restaurant that was available for purchase. Very neat idea. If we are ever in the area again, we will be stopping at Dish for sure!!",

There is a great selection of Southern items, with vegetarian options if that's your thing, and I really love it. The place is homey and artsy and genuine, and I like eating here. I will say the one time I had dessert, it was so overly sweet that it almost hurt my mouth. The flavor would have been great if they had just toned down the sugar.  Recommend: Country fried steak. They do it right.",

Let me single out the gravy on the brick meatloaf as looking like a gloppy congealed massive wobbling blob. Disgusting.  The server was very apologetic of the fiasco and we understood her embarrassment. I'm summoning Gordon Ramsey on their behalf!! They should seriously be ashamed of themselves for attempting to serve this cold mess.  We walked out after the quick taste and we will never, ever, ever go back.",

They also have a Full Bar in the back. We haven't had a bad meal yet. The atmosphere is pleasant, and the staff are friendly, and good at their jobs. The food prices are VERY fair, and the portions are more than enough. You won't leave hungry.   Some of our favorites for starters are the Fried Green Tomatoes, The Parmesan Potato Poppers, and the Cajun Meatloaf Sliders. My Wife Raves about the Soups, and the Grilled Eggplant Pita. My Personal Favorites are the Chicken and Dumplings, Shrimp and Grits, and the Cajun Meatloaf w/Mashed Potatoes. They also have a GREAT breakfast in the $5-6 Dollar Range. Their Bacon ROCKS !

I let the server know after only taking several bites to which she quickly whipped back that they didn't take food off the check for not liking it. That policy is fine, I don't even oppose that policy, but that's not what I asked for, in fact I didn't ask for anything. She then retorted that she wouldn't have any idea what cat food taste like so she couldn't comment on that and walked off. A simple \"I'm sorry about that\" or \"could I get you some more (side item) to make up for that\" would have been a great other option to throw out there. The manager John was no better to deal with. We won't be back with the way they treat customers.",

I was excited that their menu had BBQ jackfruit as I had heard about it a while ago and have been wanting to try it. We sat down on their nice back patio, excited to order and we're told they were out for the night. It was a disappointment because it wasn't that late, and it kind of irritates me when restaurants run out of items (especially early in the evening). We ended up leaving since everything else on the menu was pretty standard/nothing unique to Charlotte, but they were nice and understanding about it.",

It also has enough character of kitschy decor and usually a good playlist to enhance the experience and take it up a notch from the usual southern fare place.  Plus, what a great part of town!  Before I became a vegetarian, the chicken and dumplings was one of my favorites.  Now, I usually order the three veggie plate-a big fan of the collards, mac and cheese, the squash casserole, and sweet potatoes.  Plus, the fluffy biscuit and yummy deviled egg take the plate up a notch and make it a very satisfying meal.  I got the black beans last time, which I was not such a fan as they weren't anything special--a little dry.  I also love the burrito with black-eyed peas, collards, and sweet potatoes.  My boyfriend orders the grilled cheese and tomato soup 99% of the time we go there.  The tomato soup is out of this world.  Some people had compared Dish to Lupie's.  Dish is far superior in my opinion.  Everything is just a little better at Dish, whereas everything is a little bit of a letdown at Lupie's.  (Sorry to Lupie fans, just one opinion.)",

The biscuit and my sides of mashed potatoes and mac n chz were both very good, as well. The biscuit does need a bit of honey (just ask your server for some), as most good homemade biscuits do--they are made to be a \"background\" to homemade jams, honey, etc that you layer on them, in the South.

The vegetables are traditional Southern comfort/soul while being vegetarian friendly, as they are not cooked in meat broth, a practive which is so prevalent in the south.   The ambiance is young & hip and the portions are huge for such a small price.  Do not miss this restaurant.",

I've seen people on Yelp and heard people in real life rave about the chicken and dumplings, but when I went, they were super bland. I mean, I had to douse those things in salt and pepper. However, our waitress was super cool, and the collards I ordered on the side were tasty, so Dish gets three stars from me.",

It seems that the owner must be trying hard to make an impression but the rest of the staff just isn't. I've gotten the chicken and dumplings a few times but like Chad said they just lack the flavor you're looking for in a good chicken and dumplings. The mac and cheese is actually a pretty good side. The cheese is there. Never been a fan of deviled eggs so can't really comment there.   The parking can be difficult at times since this location is on Thomas street and Thomas street only has one good lot across from dish that it shares with people that are eating at Penguin and Zada Janes. Overall good but not amazing.   I've heard that if you are really looking for AMAZING chicken and dumplings that The Fresh House in Locust is amazing. I still have yet to try it but I hear some 80 year old grandmother makes them fresh every other weekend.",

I have tried the chicken and dumplings and found them to be the perfect blend of soft, cream, and dumpling. I have also had the salmon cakes with honey butter. Yummie!   It's usually crowded.

Recently my mom and I had lunch here and truly enjoyed going meatless with the wide selection on the veggie menu. I particularly enjoyed the tomato soup and the green beans and the deviled egg and biscuit really added an extra touch. Dish also has plenty of options for carnivores including burgers (veggie available), sandwiches such as fish, grilled eggplant and grilled pimento cheese, entrees like meatloaf, shrimp & grits and chicken & dumplings, a variety of salads and \"South of the Border\" items like nachos, burritos and quesadillas. Desserts are also offered including a wonderful sounding vanilla bourbon sweet potato pie - yum! I look forward to returning to Dish again soon. In addition to lunch and dinner service, breakfast is also served on Saturday from 10-3.",

    "text": "It's be over a year since I've been to Dish (I no longer live in Charlotte); however, I have lots of fond memories of this place.  Dish is located in an edgy, off-beat part of Charlotte, and it fits in perfectly!  From the outside you might think that Dish is a simple restaurant with not much flare, but you would be wrong.  Once inside you realize that Dish is a colorful place.  The staff members have an edge that you would expect from a restaurant in this neighbor.  They may not always keep your glass full but they will certainly have style when forgetting to do so.  Choosing what to order is certainly an enjoyable experience.  You're presented with several options from a menu filled with delicious comfort food.  I recommend the cajun meatloaf.  It's your mama's meatloaf with an extra kick!  Everything's reasonably priced so your wallet won't feel restricted in the slightest.  The atmosphere isn't my personal favorite, but it's a look that I know some people appreciate.  And as I mentioned, everything about this restaurant is in harmony with the surrounding neighborhood.  The crowd that's usually found here is fun and down-to-earth.  It can get pretty busy on the weekends, but the wait is never long.  If you're looking for a restaurant to take your friends from out of town, Dish is a good option.  Your friends won't be wow'd; however, they'll leave feeling satisfied.",

The lady, who's name was Lane on the receipt, was a complete and total B**ch! We came with 3 adults and 2 children, problem #1 obviously for her! She made a point to hand our kids crayons and say now dont break these crayons, you aren't the only kids that use them, our kids at 3 and 1. When she picks the crayons up at the end of the meal she then says oh great job you didnt manage to break the crayons... completely unnecessary comments! Damn if you are hurting that much, I believe crayons are about a dollar from the dollar store for a 24 pack. Problem #2, completely over charged us and didnt even apologize, just got so unbelievably nasty to us and said that's just how it is in my system. Ok, that's  a lie, its completely says it's a breakfast sandwich that comes with bacon, you adding bacon as an add on... yea you did that, not your system. Then I ask for an additional side of sausage... well she gave us 1, 1 additional sausage for $2.00!!!!! WTF, that's the most expensive sausage ever. So I ask about it, if 1 sausage is $2, and she says yes why else would I charge you.... ok, again B**ch! I highly doubt 1 sausage cost $2 but she is trying to get all the money she can! Also, at this point I realize the price I'm charged is different that what the menu says for the biscuits and gravy but I guess there is no point to say anything because she doesn't give 2 shits about anything.She is clearly pissed as she is now slamming my credit card into the machine and very aggressively ripping the paper out! I wasnt going to leave her a tip other than be nicer but I know what it's like when the only money you make is off tips, so she only got 10% but she didn't deserve it. Get yalls crap together! This place used to always have a line but it's clearly obvious why that has stopped!",

No hash brown casserole on the list, but I went with a country fried steak, mashed potatoes, collard greens, plus each meal comes with a biscuit and deviled egg. Started the meal with biscuits and gravy. Gravy was smooth and peppery. The steak was tenderized enough, ok flavor. The biscuit with the meal had an interesting buttery, sweet glaze/shell on top. Almost like a buttered glazed donut. Collards were pretty good as well. Mashed were a rough mash, with a lot of butter and light on the milk, so closer to a smashed potato (but fresh).",

Parking in this area can be a bit of a challenge but we ended missing a turn and circling the block and when we did, we ended up with a spot of the side of the street almost in front of the restaurant. Got lucky for a change.  Interesting interior with local artwork but again, this is one of the arts district in Charlotee.  We were seated immediately which was not surprising since we were there 10 minutes after their 10am opening time. Would have liked to have tried their lunch menu but since I had a hair appointment to cut the little that I have left at 12:30, breakfast it was.  It's not an extensive breakfast menu unlike their dinner menu but what we did try was pretty good. I had the Carolina Country Breakfast which was Eggs cooked anyway you want them, bacon, hash brown casserole, grits and biscuit with sausage gravy on the side.  In general very good. Eggs and the bacon was perfect. hash browns were good although I would have liked the potatoes to be a little less crunchy. The Grits were pretty good and that's amazing since I don't even like Grits. The Biscuit was excellent. A nice Southern Style. Sausage gravy needs work since there was no sausage flavor and it was somewhat watery.  My wife had the Lite Breakfast which was Fruit, Bacon, Eggs and they did permit her to substitute Marbled Rye Break as her bread choice.  Her biggest complaint our restaurants that serve fruit, generally serve large portions of Melon and little else. Granted that the cheap way to go. Not the case, here. It did have a couple pieces of Crenshaw Melon but also had Pineapple, Orange Slices and other goodies that made for good variety.  All in all, except for taking a while to cook our breakfast, service was very good and we will be back sometime in the near future late enough to catch the lunch menu",

This place is super cozy and quaint, decorated with yellow gingham vinyl table cloths and mismatched photos, it's kind of like being at your grandma's house... this applies to the food too. It's a good low-key jeans and tshirt date spot. Maybe ask to sit downstairs, the upstairs has always been a little prison-y to me with the painted cinder block walls.   What you should order:  -chocolate pecan pie (get it heated up) is to die for. I can't even describe how good it is. If you're getting it to go, ask for the whipped cream on the side.  -salmon patties. I don't even like salmon and I love these.  -chicken and dumplings.   They've got killer drink specials, lotion in the bathrooms, and purchasable local art on the walls to boot!",

The Dish is one of those places... you dream about.. the staff is warm and friendly.. they greet you at the door with awesome hello's and how r ya's... they point you to your usual section or sit you where you would like. The patrons are all down to earth.. respectfully and peacefully glancing at each others selections .   The Food:- This is the serious part. The owners at the Dish take food seriously...  The menu consists of southern staples and classics with modern approaches...  I enjoy their specials and keep coming back for their staples.. their vegetables are prepared by a vegetarian and the biscuits are delicious...  ciao",

Don't be fooled by its inconspicuous exterior. This joint does it all well! Just close your eyes and point to anything on the menu and you'll be pleased.  I usually get either the meatloaf or chicken and dumplins. The meatloaf has a spicey kick and both have their own charm. The sides are uniquely varied and are all super. As an added bonus, most entrees include a deviled egg that this southern boy finds most delicious!  Atmosphere is very casual and service is friendly and attentive. Count yourself especially lucky if your server is the joyous Yolanda. Located in the hip Plaza Midwood area. It's a Gotta Try for sure!",

There were two in my party we ordered:  Cajun veggie loaf w mac n cheese Chicken and dumplings w sweet potatoes   I really disliked the cajun veggie loaf, it was mushy and very bland. I just couldn't eat it. It came w gravy but it tasted strange to me. The mac n cheese and potatoes needed a lot of seasoning but we're good after that.  The same was True for the other meal, it was severely lacking in seasoning.  I was pretty disappointed that the cajun veggie loaf wasn't removed from our bill since I told the waitress upfront that I don't like mushy food but we paid for it anyway.  Overall, there may be better items on the menu, some other Yelpers enjoyed their food.",

As for the prices, I found them reasonable and actually thought that they were a good value for the size of the portions served.  WE picked Dish because we are big fans of going to places featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and we were certainly not disappointed with Dish.  i would absolutely recommend Dish to anyone because there is something on the menu that everyone can enjoy.",

I always ask myself, why are you so fond of their \"Southern homestyle cooking?\" It's a part of that whole Central Ave corridor of restaurants like Penguin and The Diamond. We'll call it great just because of their location. Absolutely not.   Every time I walk into the place, I laugh. I literally laugh out loud because of how tacky it feels. I know you're on Central Ave and want to get that artsy and we've character unlike everyone else. Please, there isn't a hint of character in the place. You're probably saying, who cares it's an unpretentious place, it's the food you go for and the price. Keep telling yourself that.  The servers on the other hand are great. I have no complaints with them. They helped us as soon as we started looking at the menu and we received our drinks in a timely manner. The place was probably three-quarters filled and on a holiday. The menu is fairly standard and has your staple southern dishes hinted throughout the appetizers to the entrees. Nothing special. And I almost feel that for the location, the price for the appetizers would be a little more reasonable. What do I know though?   We all ordered our food and I decided to go for something different this time. I got the Chicken & Dumplings the last time I was here, so I went for the meatloaf hoping for something more enticing than flour and cream of chicken. That's what the C&Ds taste like if you were wondering. Bland and tasteless. Apparently a lot of people like them, but if I had the choice I'd take the Swanson C&Ds. THAT good, my friends.   Back to my meatloaf. This is how it was prepared; mash a bunch of ground beef, add no seasoning, cook in oven, dip and cover in tomato sauce, plop it on a scoop of mashed potatoes, and add a dash of cilantro on top. The meatloaf wasn't at all what I had expected. I was expecting more flavor for them to actually call it Cajun. There was no cajun seasoning, onion, celery, garlic, or cayenne peppers. I'm not even sure if I tasted the essential Worcestershire sauce. Mashed potatoes were decent I'll admit. Potato salad, eh. Deviled egg, eh too. Biscuit I enjoyed, but maybe because my mind hoped it could enjoy something from the meal. I didn't enjoy the price that went along with the food either.   I know this place is locally owned and operated and is a part of Charlotte history and culture. It just feels that they are taking advantage of that and laugh quietly to themselves for each hungry customer that comes in. I honestly expect better because of that history. They are there for a reason, but not for their food lately. Customers need to wake up and realize that the Dish has greater potential.",

One of the proprietors here also use to be part owner of the Milestone and  Tremont... so you can imagine that this place is going to be a little edgier than your standard southern diner.   The first time I went there, everything was absolutely fabulous. The second visit didn't blow me away, but everything was solid.  I love comfort food so one of the biggest challenges for me is deciding what to order. On both visits, they offered great specials.  But being a southern girl, one of my fav childhood dishes was grandma's chicken & dumplings... and their version is good.  If you are looking for a casual, affordable, comfort-food dining experience that isn't part of a big chain, this is a great option.  Its a great place to take out-of-town guests if you want them to experience a little local flavor.",

We went for lunch he ordered pork chops since I was paying -_- and I went with the chicken & dumplings. Let this be known, I only went with the chicken & dumplings because I do not like them and the fellow yelpers made me want to \"eat\" my words.   Our food came out and the first thing I noticed were the large portions, it was a ton of food for lunch. I dug right into the chicken & dumplings and was amazed, they really are as good as reviewed. I am going to have a high standard for this dish whenever I eat them again, if I eat them anywhere else that is. For my side it was the squash casserole, it was interesting I have never had anything like it before. It was sweet, mushy and cheesy, I liked it.   My dad loved his pork chops, even though before ordering he was complaining about the price. I feel like if you get huge portions that are good quality then price should not be a problem. I enjoyed Dish and look forward to dining here again in the future.",

We take my husband's family here every time they're in town, and it's always a hit. Must try: Country fried steak (smack your Momma kind of good!), deviled eggs, Cajun meatloaf, chicken and dumplings, collard dip, pimento cheese dip (served hot), the squash casserole side dish, green beans, and pretty much every dessert item. Highly recommended if you're in the mood for good old fashioned comfort food!!",

    "text": "The \"DISH\" RESTAURANT DOES NOT HONOR THEIR GLUTEN FREE MENU: Terrible experience with the wait staff in understanding what a GLUTEN ALLERGY is. We ordered from the Gluten Free menu. We made the waiter aware that this was not just a fad but people at the table had this and specifically told the waiter that for all of the plates if there was something with gluten like bread or biscuits JUST TO NOT BRING IT OUT for any of the meals. Unfortunately ALL of the meals arrived with bread right next to all of the gluten free items we had ordered and thus contaminated everything on the plates. When we all asked for all new food because it was not prepared correctly, the person at the door who doubled as a waiter and brought the plates to our table went into this long dissertation about not guaranteeing their food to be gluten free. Most restaurants in seeing that any type of orders were messed up, simply apologize and then go and redo the orders and bring back fresh food. This person refused to do that and basically said take it or leave it. The bottom line for ANYONE with a GLUTEN ALLERGY  is to NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS PLACE! There are tons of restaurants who understand this and try their best to accommodate you so the only way they will respect this is to NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY AT THE \"DISH\" Restaurant",

The clientele is as interesting as the food.    Some of the highlights from the menu include the Cajun meatloaf, the chicken and dumplings, shrimp and grits.  The meals come with a deviled egg and biscuit which are a great touch.    The only thing I would fault them on is the awkward placement of the bar.  It's in the very back of the restaurant but I rarely eat at the bar so it doesn't affect their rating.    This is good stuff.  I think I need to go back..TODAY!.",

Or a lot.   The rest of the menu offers good bar-type food and things like burgers, fried chicken, mashed potatoes--you know, real-deal comfort food that you'd expect.

Plus, you can buy the art off the walls, made by local artists; it really is a really unique experience.  The food was awesome - I had the salmon cakes, squash casserole and rice.  All 3 were really quite amazing - I love the home cooking feel to the place, and you get very generous portions.  The wait staff was really friendly, letting us sit wherever we wanted, near the heaters or by the windows and the service overall was very attentive.

We started with drinks; I ordered the Ice Pick which was sweet tea, vodka, and lemon juice. It was a very good drink and at $4.00 it just can't be beat. My husband ordered the SoCo and lime it was also good and $4.00. We ordered the Collard Dip for an appetizer. This was the highlight of the meal a perfect balance of creamy salty and bitter on lightly toasted pita triangles; it also came with tortilla chips. I ordered the chicken and dumplings with potato salad for my side. The chicken and dumplings were the best I have had, they were not bland at all; black pepper, onion and garlic all flavored the thick broth. There was lots of shredded chicken and small tender pieces of dumpling. It also came with a tender, flaky, golden brown biscuit and a tasty deviled egg. The potato salad was good not great. My Husband ordered the salmon cakes they were good but nothing special. They did come with an orange honey butter on top and that was delish as well as two sides. The mac and cheese was kind of bland and greasy. The mashed sweet potatoes were nicely seasoned with butter, sugar and cinnamon. The service was quick and attentive. If it were not for the salmon cakes and the mac and cheese I would have given this place five stars.",

They have the menu items down pat but fall down in the  flavor and preparation department.  - Fried green tomatoes were bland and \"hard.\"  The are lightly battered in an unseasoned flour and served with a dill/horseradish dipping sauce.  A seasoned corn meal batter would've been much better.  The tomatoes were thinly sliced but were \"hard\" (way too young).  Since they weren't that good it didn't bother me that they only give you about a third of a tomato.  - Collard dip sounded like a cool idea but...  They basically take a traditional spinach dip and substitute collards.  The menu says served hot, but ours came cold (not room temp but cold) and clearly straight from the fridge!  The pita wedges were put on the grill for a few seconds, but were not grilled enough either.  - Pork chops were very tough and grilled with a heavy handed too-sweet maple glaze  - Salmon patties were cooked way too fast and ended up nicely browned on the outside but way undercooked and soupy on the inside.  - Pot roast was tender and pretty good  - Collards were fresh but over-the-top sweet.  Who wants sweet collards anyway?  A hint of sweetness I can see, but these were just not good.  - Squash casserole was nicely flavored but the squash were cooked to death  - Finally, the deviled egg had been boiled so long, my egg white was actually hard  The place was almost full when we visited.  I'm guessing that any repeat patrons are eating here because it's in a trendy locale, and they've probably never had good and True Southern cooking.  You certainly can't get that at Dish!",

Both were absolutely mouth watering.  We usually split our dishes, but we both didn't feel like sharing the goodness :) We will definitely be coming back as soon as possible and will update on my next dish at Dish!",

From the location to the staff to the clientele.... it was all very colorful and interesting. But as for the food, well, the fried green tomatoes which are an all time favorite of mine, were superb. My friend had the hot pimento dip and friends let me tell you, I do not like pimento cheese... but this dip... well bring it on, will have it again the next time!  She also ordered the shrimp & grits and they were also to die for!  I ordered a bowl of collard & bean soup and must say that the flavor was all there but it was extremely salty and I love salt!  I ate the collards & beans, but left most of the broth. OH, I almost forgot, the biscuits.... soooooo light and fluffy.... could have filled up on those alone!  Would go back in a heartbeat!",

They also serve salads and tacos as well, so it is just not your typical fried chicken and collard green home cooking. From the outside the place looks grungy, but being located off of Central Ave in Plaza Midwood there isn't any upscale classy book covers anyway. I've been a couple of times and our service has always been amazing. The wait staff seem to love their jobs and knowledgeable about the food. The food is unexplainable to the tip. There isn't one item that I would recommend over the other because I haven't had anything that was horrible. Their menu is great for the \"I don't know what do you want to eat?\" conversation. My better half and I drive about 30 minutes to Dish because we can never agree on a place. We love sitting on the patio when the weather is nice out. Definitely a landmark in Charlotte and I highly recommend bringing guests that are visiting!",

I was pleasantly surprised when a girlfriend and I headed over there after yoga class for dinner when I saw that it's much more casual.   From North Carolina comfort-food favorites to nice bar food, Dish has a lot of options. The variety is good if you're going to bring a group of folks...I keep Dish on my list of family-friendly restaurants for when my folks visit. Dish has good options for vegetarians without freaking out my country-living parents.  I thought the service was great, and I also am a fan of the pecan pie. It's located in a great part of town, and I'm glad that there are so many options opening up in this area to help share the Penguin's love.",

We both said it was the best meal we had in a very long time and I think that would have been evident to anyone from the looks on our faces. We started with the potato pancakes which were heavenly.  The mashed potatoes inside were smooth and flavorful.  Not one crumb was left on the plate. My daughter had the pot roast with mac & cheese and mashed potatoes.  I had the blackened chicken breast with mashed potatoes and squash casserole.  I ate the deviled eggs (mine and hers) first and knew it was going to be a great meal.  I finished my squash casserole next before tasting anything else.  I told my daughter I could have stopped right there and would have been satisfied.  She felt the same about her meal. Everything was fantastic and the service was impeccable. We will definitely go back the next time we are in Charlotte.  Can't wait!",

The wait staff (at least the one working my table) was horrible.   My food came out luke warm and I asked for it to be taken back and warmed up.   She did in fact take it back but it was another 15 minutes before I received my food again.   Most of the time she had this deer caught in head lights look about her which warned me to keep my questions simple and my replies brief.  All in all, not a terrible place to eat, but I would make it a \"nowhere else I really want to go\" place.",

I got the Grilled Chicken pesto (the name on the menu) Wheat Pita. It actually was pulled chicken not grilled, granted if I would have read more in detail past the title I would have seen the pulled part. But beside that it was stuffed with so much pulled chicken you couldn't even pick it up and it also was so soggy even if you could pick it up it fell to pieces. I was very disappointed. On a lighter note, the green beans were amazing (definitely, fresh and homemade) and the Tomato soup was delish as well. As I said, maybe I just chose the wrong thing and I wouldn't be against trying again.",

    "text": "I pass through Charlotte at least a couple times per year, typically around the holidays, and usually meet up with friends to grab a bite to eat.  Tonight, we ended up in Plaza Midwood (a small neighborhood with trendy eateries) at Dish.  Dish is a casual Southern restaurant with a laid back atmosphere, friendly staff, and reasonably priced food.  The restaurant has a bit of an old school Southern feel to it with its small wooden tables and chairs, vinyl tablecloths, and retro signage and decor.  The menu features Southern staples such as chicken and dumplings, meatloaf, shrimp and grits, and a pot roast.  They also serve Mexican items (burritos and quesadillas) and sandwiches.  I was drawn to their BBQ sliders appetizer because it included three sliders with a choice of three sauces: eastern NC (vinegar based), SC (mustard based), and \"Chicago\" (sweet tomato based).  I asked for one slider with each sauce.  Each slider had pulled pork with the sauce poured on top, inside of a biscuit with a pickle on top.  The plate was served with a small sample of Carolina-style cole slaw (vinegar, no mayo).  There was not as much meat as I hoped and while the biscuits were good, there was too high of a bread-to-meat ratio for my liking.  Like other Southern restaurants, Dish offers vegetable plates.  Each vegetable plate comes with a biscuit, glazed on top with honey, and a deviled egg.  I tried the mac and cheese, squash casserole, and mashed sweet potatoes.  The noodles in the mac and cheese were your typical small sized mac and cheese noodles (like you make at home).  Good texture and not too oily.  Squash casserole tasted homemade (in a good way).  Not a huge fan of the mashed sweet potatoes, but you could tell they were freshly mashed sweet potatoes and not processed.  Check out my photos to see the food.  Our server was Mollie and she provided good service.  The food came out fast.  The restaurant has a bar in the back and also has a bunch of unique paintings.  Not sure if they are for sale, but they were interesting to look at.  There's plenty of free parking in the open lot across the street from the entrance.",

My girlfriend and I shared the meatloaf sliders appetizer and the chicken and dumplings dish with a side of mashed sweet potatoes.  The meatloaf sliders were very good. The best part of the meal by far was the cajun spice on the meatloaf; if I come back to Dish, I will probably order the meatloaf as my entree because it was excellent. The slider buns were a little dry and took away from the great meatloaf just slightly, but overall the sliders were still very good. The chicken and dumplings were just okay in my opinion and my girlfriend's. A lot of people have raved about them being amazing, but they were definitely not life changing. The chicken was very tender and the dumplings were as well, but as a whole it wasn't extremely flavorful or memorable in any way. The mashed sweet potatoes on the side were amazing, however. Nice and sweet but not too much so, and they had a little cinnamon taste that balanced it all perfectly. The biscuit was a little dry, and the deviled egg was pretty good. Overall, the food was good but not great with some things better than others. The service was solid as well, and the prices are pretty cheap, especially for the amount of food you get.",

    "text": "I dig Dish. After not wanting to wait over an hour at Soul, out of town friends and I walked over to Dish. I was telling my friend that it was featured on \"Diners, Drive Ins and Dives\" and they were sold on going. I've only been once before and remembered I liked it but nothing like \" I need to go back to Dish soon!\" so I was stoked to try it again. It looks a little hood from the outside but when you get in, it has a southern diner kind of feel with eclectic decor. I never knew they had a patio so we opted to sit out there and I thought it was a cute patio area and loved the touch of Christmas lights. We started off with the black eyed pea hummus which was fantastic. It was a tangy/hot chutney on top that was a nice touch to it served along with pita pieces.   As always, I was flip flopping about what to order, they offer southern dishes but surprisingly offer quite a bit of vegetarian dishes as well such as veggie burgers, veggie plates and more. They also have a South of The Border selection which kinda threw me off a little since I wasn't expecting it. I couldn't decide on something so I decided to go with the old standby of a cheeseburger but jazzed it up by getting a Pimento Cheeseburger with mashed sweet potatoes. Great burger all in all but it could've used a bun the size of the patty and you can't go wrong with mashed sweet potatoes. We all split a piece of the Chocolate Pecan Pie which was rich and delicious.   I know some people have described it as comfort food, Southern fare, etc but I really don't know what I would classify it as.I do know I had a great meal (VERY reasonable prices) with great service while enjoying a beautiful night on the patio so I would head back to try something more \"comforting\" next time.",

    "text": "Went on Saturday, 02/07/15 for lunch with 3 friends. It was our first time there, but I was familiar with it from watching Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. Parking was better than I expected for a big city - perhaps on the weekend there isn't as much at that time of day.  It was still pretty crowded, and had to wait a few minutes for a table, but nothing that was extreme. And I have to apologize for no pictures.  We were like a herd of starving coyote's and wolfed down the food before we even thought about showing off how it looked.   I'm not sure if they were shorthanded, or we just had a waitress who didn't bring her A game.  We waited 15 minutes for our drink and food orders to be taken. She did apologize for the delay, but it was like that for most of the other interactions.  To be fair, I think that they were shorthanded on wait staff, but noticed that the bartenders seemed to have little to do.  Put them to work!  We ordered a few appetizers, the cajun meatloaf sliders, fried green tomatoes with dill horseradish sauce, and the parmesan potato poppers. Now, I'm a big fan of FGT, and these, well, they were OK, but not great like I hoped.  They were lightly golden brown, and didn't have any discernible flavor in the batter, not even  salt & pepper.  Once I added S&P, it improved the flavor but it did surprise me that it seemed so bland.  Also, not loving the sauce that accompanied it.  Would have preferred a remoulade sauce, or even onion jam, or heck.. just a little hot sauce. The cajun sliders were the hit of the table, followed closely by the poppers.  These were like cheesy mashed potatoes rolled into a ball, dipped in eggwash, crumbs  and deep fried to a golden brown delicious color.  Very well seasoned.  It was served with a peppercorn sauce that was tasty, but not sure if it is the best option.  Kinda reminded me of pierogies (not in texture, but flavor).    I originally planned to order the cajun meatloaf, but changed my mind at the last minute to try and save room for pie (no room, but maybe next visit!) and went for their pimento cheeseburger.  It was cooked appropriately in my opinion just the tiniest of pink blushes so was moist and flavorful, nothing super special though, but done right.  Would recommend/have again. My side was squash casserole.  This is something I haven't tasted in years, and it was similar to a family recipe. Shredded cheese, chunks of bread, and slices of squash & I believe onions were layered together  - very moist and flavorful.  Tasted like homemade - not something I would want every visit, but definitely recommend if you like your down home veggie dishes.  Both the guys in our group got the country fried steak.  I tried a bite of the husbands and it was tasty! One got mac n cheese as their side, both fellows tried it and agreed it was good, not the greatest but they have some pretty high mac & cheese standards.  Another got the creamy tomato soup.  I tasted and thought it was perfect, thick and creamy texture, not too thin, and no chunks, seasoned really well.  The fellow who ordered thought it was too thick, but flavorful so I suppose its a matter of preference in texture for your tomato soup.   The other lady in our group got a breakfast plate, tasty and filling.  Didn't try the hash-brown casserole her's came with, but she didn't expect it to be so.. liquidy.  When she showed it was dripping a cheesy sauce.  I can imagine it being quite tasty, but didn't expect it to be dripping either. Oh, and if you order entrees, you also get a deviled egg on the side.  Heavenly good - high marks on those!  Oh, and our drinks.  While I was tempted to order a bloody mary or a mimosa (the day's specials), I ordered my usual water.  It tasted really bad.  I'm not a sparkling water or springs kind of water snob, but it tasted metally/old.  I tried the sweet tea, which hid the flavor of the water.  My husband didn't seem to notice the water flavor so you may not have any issues either.   TLDR - Dish is a fun Dive to visit, with overall good food.  Will be planning another visit in the future to see if the service improves, and maybe get that slice of pie (Chocolate Pecan Pie or the Vanilla Bourbon Sweet Potato pie) that are so tempting.

    "text": "I wanted to love this place.  I really did.  But things just didn't work out between us  :(  The other half and I popped in one evening recently since we were in the neighborhood.  He'd been there once before and had good things to say, so I said \"heck yah man, let's go.\"  We both ordered the salmon patties.  Most southern establishments do a bang up job with those infamous little fish discs.   Not Dish.  They had the straaaangest flavor my taste buds have experienced in some time.  The mashed potatoes weren't MASHED, they were CLUMPED--big difference.  And oh dear Lord they were D-R-Y dry.  And to add insult to the proverbial injury, the mac-n-cheese was more like ick-n-cheese.  Clumpy.  Greasy.  Sad.  Service was also substantially lacking.  There was NO ONE in the place except for a VERY FEW people in the back bar area, so one would expect to experience no wait time or not to have to hunt down a waitress for a refill.  Not so this evening.  I think she may have come by to check on us twice (which includes her taking the order).    In summary I experienced a very broken Dish and a bad taste left in my mouth (both literally and figuratively).  Neither one of us enjoyed our meal & wasted nearly $30.  HOWEVER I am willing to give them one more try.  Maybe this was just an ''off'' day.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  But next time better be HELLA yummy!!!",

I went with the country fried steak with mashed potatoes and creamed corn plus a biscuit. I was looking to try the collard greens but they were unfortunately out at the time! (Dang! Guess I'll have to go back for them). My food was absolutely incredible and my wife ordered the fried egg and bacon sandwich which she devoured!

The freshly baked biscuit is an old-fashioned classic and so is the deviled eggs.   Enjoy grandma's dishes at Dish. Four Solid Yelps.",

My work colleague (who's visited several times) swears the cajun meatloaf is the way to go.  The service was generally fine... nothing particularly memorable. However, I will say that it was *pouring* down rain when we went, and they sat us at the very last table, next to the window, in the bar area. After getting splattered with water several times, the bartender seemed unsurprised when we requested to be moved. Since it seems like he knew those windows leak when it rains, why were we put there, in the far back corner, when half the tables in the restaurant were empty? Anyway, it was an annoyance but not a huge deal. Given the quality of the food, it's likely I'll be back.",

Last night our waitress (maybe candy) was friendly but would abandon our table for like 20 min at a time.   When the food was dropped off, my country fried steak was wet, soggy and not appetizing. Since candy didn't come back at all, I was stuck eating only side dishes. By the end of the dinner she didn't ask if it was ok or anything just took away the plate with the full steak on it.   I didn't want to complain in front of other guests who were new to the restaurant so I called later to inform the management. They offered me a free piece of pie with my next visit which was nice but felt more like a Denny's coupon than an actual apology for the poor quality of the food and bad service. And actually the manager didn't even acknowledge that anything was wrong.   At this point I'm not sure if I'll go back there. Diamond has a similar cheap southern food vibe and is pretty consistent with food quality and service.",

This time I ordered a vegetable plate: collards, squash casserole, side salad and pinto beans. The salad and beans were fine but the rest could have been better. They make a point to not use meat in their vegetables which is totally fine but the collards could have used some olive oil. They were just not that flavorful. The worst offender was the squash casserole which if done right can be really great. I actually counted about 4 to 5 small,this slices of squash. The rest was a lot of onions and a lot of goo. Not a good representation of squash casserole. The last time I went, I had the salmon patties - marginal - and green beans which were woody.   I will probably return at some point because it's a cute, convenient place with a nice staff. What I'd really like to go back for is fried chicken - but it's not on the menu (which is weird considering this is a quintessential Southern diner.)",

Went with pimento cheese dip after a little debate over the other options. Great environment. Interesting decor on the walls. Bar area and brunch area are very different. Unique in their own ways. One of the orders was wrong but they were extremely apologetic and took no time on preparing the correct order.

They were running a French toast special that included eggs and bacon with it for like 8 bucks! It was great.  If you have never tried one of their desserts next time you are there make sure to save room or take something to go. Their most popular is a Chocolate pecan pie with fresh whip cream.",

Three of our four arrived and since the whole party wasn't there to be seated, three sat in the bar, and the hostess asked our names and the name of the fourth arriving. When the fourth arrived, she said she was meeting three more and the same hostess said no one was there. So our fourth sat and waited until 15 meetings after our designated meeting time when we went out to find her.   Then we were finally seated in a table that had been open the whole time and it took the waitress 10 minutes before stopping at the table to take our drink orders - two teas and two beers. The place was not full and there were at least three waitstaff in the restaurant. She did not tell us the specials but one in our party went to the chalkboard and reported back. 15 minutes later the waitress brought only half the drink orders (and still had not taken our food order) and so we had to ask for the other two drinks, of which she did not remember. *sigh* Then finally a half hour after being seated, she took our food order. NO DEVILED EGGS because of Avian flu but we were not told at the time we ordered. Only when the plates arrived sans eggs and we asked were we informed.    Thankfully the food was good and we made a point to tell the cooks on our way out, but the waitstaff could use a little pep talk to get them on the ball. Good reputations only last so long.",

Served  with a dollop of avocado mash.  Didn't stick around for dessert.  They have a bar area. All their side are prepared vegetarian and they have a bunch of veg options for main dishes.

Upon entering, during lunch the front part of the seating area was full and thankfully we were seated promptly in the back section.  There are lots of neat paintings / artwork on the walls which I think were for sale.  How cool!  Good, southern comfort food describes the menu.  I ordered the cajun meatloaf and mashed potatoes with deviled eggs as the side since I've had their deviled eggs before and remembered how good they were.  I wasn't disappointed, the Cajun meatloaf was freaky spicy, and not too moist (which is good IMO) and covered with a creamy brown gravy as opposed to that normal foodservice nasty brown gravy.  The deviled eggs were perfectly made and had the perfect flavor that I think in a True act of gluttony I could have ate about a dozen.  For dessert they had a bourbon sweet potato pie that was quite honestly one of the best desserts I have tried in a while.  They didn't scrimp on the Bourbon and was glad I didn't hit a license check on my way back to work!    Great job DISH.  I love locally owned places like this and am glad they're still around!",

I forgot our server's name, but she was definitely awesome! If you're looking for a good mom and pop joint, this will hit the spot!",

    "text": "Definitely the place to go in Charlotte if you want to have the worst customer service experience of your life! This was not our first time eating here. I ordered the Cajun Veggie Loaf. When the food was delivered I remarked how this was so much thicker than the last time. We started eating and engaging in conversation. After finishing my two sides and about 2/3 of my entree I took a closer look and asked my wife if it looked like meat. She wasn't sure so I called the waitress over. She said it was meat. I told her I ordered the Veggie Loaf and I haven't eaten red meat in 33 years. She apologized and asked if she could do anything.  I said no I just wanted to speak with the Manager. When I told her that I could see fear in her eyes. She said that would only make things worse and she would pay for our drinks. Evidently she rules her employees with fear and intimidation. I thanked her but insisted on the manager. When the lady, I think, came over she started with an attitude. I explained that I ordered the Veggie Loaf, I might have said Veggie Meat Loaf but I did say the word VEGGIE. She started waving her finger in  my face... The waitress has never made a mistake and I ate most of my meal. It states on the menu that no discounts will be given for properly cooked food. I told her to get her finger out of my face and she said she wasn't in my face but she could be! She said...do you know how many people she has a day trying to get FREE FOOD. Told her I really don't care, I don't think I look homeless! My wife said to just bring the check. I walked up front and she went to tell the waitress to bring me the check. When the waitress came you could see the fear in her face. She told me she paid for the drinks out of her pocket. The people in the kitchen were all looking at me like DEER IN THE HEADLIGHTS!   If this is the way she, not sure if she is the manager or owner, treats her customers I'm surprised she has repeat business. At the very least she should of charged me for the two sides. It is obvious that all of the employees are scared of this person. Needless to say she lost more than two customers. I will follow this up with a LETTER TO THE EDITOR of THE CHARLOTTE OBSERVER.",

As I had the chance to look around (A LOT), I noticed other waitresses in this establishment are probably better.  My waitress actually gave me a hard time about bringing a to go box, and I actually had to wait about 10 minutes after my drinks were empty to flag her down and ask for another.  I'm never high maintenance and always laid back.  But this girl could care less if I were there and paying her a tip.   This was my second visit to Dish upon a prompting by my girlfriend to give it another try.  The food was heavily salted (and I love good home cooked meals with salt).  Service was too poor to return again.  I'm sorry Dish, I wanted to like you and maybe I would have returned had your waitress not completely acted as if you guys don't need or care about customers.",

    "text": "I had never even heard of this place, but my boyfriend moved from Dilworth to Elizabeth this weekend, so we are branching out from our usual Dilworth haunts and trying some new spots in town. First up was Dish!  We arrived around 6pm this past Friday night and the place was busy, but we were still seated immediately. All of the staff members were very friendly and accommodating from the beginning.   I can't believe how large this place is - I had no idea that Plaza Midwood had any restaurant with this much space! It's huge. The decor is quirky and unique. Boyfriend and I were seated at a small table near the back, right next to a shelf that was full of plants and interesting curios. It's charming and fun to look at.  Our waitress was an absolute doll - I can't remember her name, of course, but she was perfect.   The food is really unlike any other restaurant I've been to in Charlotte. It really does feel like you're eating a home-cooked meal. We started with the collard green dip with tortilla chips. It was exactly what you'd expect - served nice and hot, which made it taste great at first, but it quickly cooled down and lost its luster; I'm pretty sure we didn't finish it.   For our entrees, boyfriend ordered meat loaf, which didn't look elaborate, but he claimed was exactly what he wanted. I ordered a special that I saw on the entry-way chalkboard - a lemon chicken dish that was absolutely delicious. I was a little annoyed that the menu lists entrees as coming with 2 sides, but I was only offered one side when ordering, and then my meal came with 2 distinct, separated sides of the same thing. It was a little humorous, but I would have appreciated some clarity about that when I was placing my order!  The food was GOOD - comforting, rich, satisfying. The boyfriend is still raving about their biscuits, which looked incredible. I'm sure we'll be back! It would be a fun spot to bring my parents, as well. It's a Charlotte classic that shouldn't have taken me 2+ years to visit.",

The service is always great and I swear that I've never had a bad experience here either. It is truly a staple in Plaza Midwood and I hope that it never goes away.   I am not a vegetarian by any means but my boyfriend and I truly love their vegetarian meals here! I highly recommend the cajun meatloaf and their jackfruit \"pork\" sandwhich. I'm also obsessed with their grilled cheese and their creamy tomato soup. Obsessed with 99% of their appetizers too! haha, so yes, pretty much everything!   I've never had dessert here but they always have these amazing looking pies near the front counter that I've always wanted to try but the food portions are huge so I get so full by the time the check rolls around.

The biscuit with honey was my favorite.  The chicken and dumplings were okay, but I have had better. The flavor was just so so. I think it was a little too thick.

The honey glazed biscuit was my favorite thing on my plate.    My boyfriend got the bbq jackfruit sandwich which I liked better than my food. The bbq sauce had just the right amount of tang to me, my boyfriend thought it was too tangy. The mashed potatoes with gravy tasted homemade.    Everything was pretty good, but not wow.

    "text": "I came here with my friend and fiance the other night after driving by for over a year and always wondering what it was like. I was a little skeptical since some of the more recent reviews were iffy, but we were all pleasantly surprised with the food and service!   First - when we walked in three of the staff working that night - who were clearly busy - made it a point to come over, say hello, and let us know that someone would be with us in just a minute. We weren't in a rush and probably only stood up front for less than 2 minutes anyways, but I appreciated that they were so focused on customer service.   Once we sat down our waitress brought out our drinks and answered all of our questions about the menu. They have a huge menu - so naturally I had to ask 1000 questions to know what the best menu items were.   I ordered their chicken and dumplings (I think this is what they featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives). I've never had chicken and dumplings before - so I wasn't quite sure what to expect - the best way to describe it is similar to a deconstructed chicken pot pie without the vegetables. It was really good! It came with a side - so I ordered the mac and cheese which was also really good. My fiance ordered the pot roast with tomato soup, and my friend got the fried chicken sandwich topped with pimento cheese and fried green tomatoes and a side of mac and cheese. Both of their dishes were amazing, I would come back and order either of them. Most meals come with a deviled egg and a biscuit. The deviled egg was good - but I'm not really sure why it came with the meal. The biscuit was topped with some kind of honey glaze and was really really good - you could tell that they're made fresh.   Even though we were all stuffed by the end of the meal - we decided to order dessert to go. We got one of each of their pies, which were chocolate pecan pie, sweet potato pie, and key lime pie. The sweet potato pie was hands down the best. The chocolate pecan pie was good, but not amazing. And I don't like key lime pie so I can't comment on that, but my friend really liked it.   Dish is a great local spot if you're looking for great service and comfort food! I would definitely recommend checking it out and I'll be coming back!",

I like the homey feel and comfort food they offer but it's always a lil short on flavor for my taste.    This time I had the grilled chicken livers with carrots and pinto beans.  All entrees come with a deviled egg and fresh biscuit drizzled with honey butter.  My livers were good but not KNOCK your sock off good as they were over cooked and slightly dry.  I didn't pick up on  much seasoning either.  Their carrots were really tasty and that was my take away after my first visit.  The pinto beans were under cooked and had no seasoning.  Once I salted and peppered them they were much better.  It would be great if they offered Chow Chow with the pintos as that would take them to the next level.  :)  My hubby had the blackened salmon and seem to enjoy it for the most part.  The place always seem to have a good book of business and the staff are very friendly and efficient so yes we will be back and I'll keep hunting for THE DISH that makes me wanna come back more often.",

At first when we walked in we were greeted by multiple staff that were very busy. When we sat down our waitress was extremely helpful and informed us about the menu and reccomendations. I went with the pot roast which was amazing! All the food is large servings so you won't leave hungry. The others I were with got the chicken and dumplings as well as the fried chicken sandwich. Every one loved their meal! Since I was too full t eat dessert there I bought some pie to bring home. The sweet potato pie was amazing!! I want to go back and try their brunch since their dinner was so good.",

From all the things I've tried on the menu, their chicken and dumplings rises to the top for me. It's not too heavy and not too light based on your hunger level. And the sides are just too damn good, it's hard to decide. I could probably live off their Mac and cheese and carrots. Their menu is great for kids as I have lots to choose from that my child can eat.   I've never had a bad experience here. The people are always friendly. This place is just a nice, casual place to have a satisfying meal.",

Our table was set up for the reservation time, and our waitress was able to keep up with the food and drink orders as they came in. She also kept excellent records to split the checks properly with who pays for which app and who wants to pay for someone at the other end of the table. The surprise of the night was when she sang my friend a solo rendition of Happy Birthday in a stage worthy voice.  The meals served here are traditional southern comfort food and everything I tried was delicious. One friend said he got the BLT here once and then spent weeks thinking back on it. I have personally never felt that way about a BLT but I have made a mental note to try it on a future visit based on such a glowing recommendation.   We split several appetizers and my favorite was the collard dip. They were generous with their pita servings which was a relief since I feel I normally end up with more dip than dipping vessel at other restaurants. The deviled eggs were a close second favorite app.   I had the pot roast as my main and it was juicy and a huge helping. The meal served as a good comfort food option and was a huge portion that I couldn't finish.  All in it was a good expe rience and I would definitely go back.",

If you're into unseasoned thrown together soul food cooked with no love then sure try it out but next time I'll pass. I heard the chicken and dumplings were very good but on the day I went I wasn't really in the mod for dumplings so I decided to try out the Spicy Lentil loaf with collards and mac & cheese. The loaf was actually delicious if you got it with spicy ketchup... skip the horrible gravy I REPEAT skip the horrible gravy! My friend and I both made the mistake of trying the brown gravy. It was gross, no flavor at all! When she tried to send her potatoes back due to them smothering them in brown gravy they refused and said she would have to buy another side of potatoes... now in all my life I've never heard of a restaurant charging you for something you send back... NEVER! When I asked for a manager her pretended to go get someone then said the manager wasn't available. Beside that I was also not impressed with the collards, no flavor or seasoning and the mac & cheese noodles were mushy and seemed to have too much milk and not enough cheese. These are staple side items for a \"Soul food\" restaurant. If the mac aint good that's a no for me dawg! I really wish I had had a better experience because I was excited to find a new spot but this place ain't it! I wasted $20 then ended up getting food from a food car around the corner for $8 that was soooo much better.",

We ordered the pimento cheese dip with pita wedges, parmesan potato poppers and extra deviled eggs as appetizers. The pimento cheese dip and parmesan poppers were devoured before I was able to take pictures. We all said the pimento cheese dip was the best that we'd ever had. Who doesn't love deviled eggs also?  I ordered what I've always gotten and have no plans to change soon - country fried steak covered with gravy that's served over mashed potatoes and mac n cheese as a side. I love how most of their meals come with a biscuit and a deviled egg.   My dad raved over the pot roast and my mom enjoyed the blackened chicken breast. We all said it was the best place for some Southern comfort food. My siblings and I have already talked about how we want to come back asap!

Salmon cakes had a dollop of some EXCELLENT orange honey butter and were cooked perfectly w/an excellent crispy on the outside texture, collards were very fresh tasting and a good tender texture, the mac n cheese....well let's say I was very disappointed ...dry, not creamy or cheesy at all.  My friend ordered the country fried steak which I did get a taste of and was very pleased.  LOVE the fresh biscuit and deviled egg! Both were fantastic!

I like to order a half grilled cheese sandwish with a cup of tomato bisque.  I love that you get a deviled egg as a side to many dishes.  Nice touch.  My favorite is the black bean and rice burrito.  Cool tunes in the juke box.  Just a good local spot w/o the frills.",

No disappointment - our party was very pleased with the food and drink, as well as the quality and reliability of the wait staff. We arrived around 7pm (Friday night) and we were promptly seated.  We chose to sit in the back away from the front counter, kitchen and related traffic and noise.  We ordered drinks along with dozen deviled eggs and an order of meat loaf sliders.  All appetizers were delicious and consumed with pleasure.  My friend said the deviled eggs were just like his mother makes - a high level complement indeed!   Our Dinner orders included an order of fried green tomatoes, two orders of country fried steak, and chicken dumplings - with each entree accompanied with another deviled egg and a freshly baked biscuit.  Not much left on any plate. To close, we shared a slice of key lime pie and the last serving available of hot blueberry/blackberry cobbler, served with a generous portion of vanilla ice cream.  All of us were very pleased with the continual visits by the waitress during our dinner.  Overall, our experience last night was very good.  And we will continue to take our friends and out of town visitors to Dish.  Excellent fresh cooked Southern comfort food, solid service, and reasonable prices.",

It is a fine place to go for lunch or dinner, but it's better to go a  little early because this place gets quite crowded.

I had heard good things and had heard that basically everything is good so go for it.  I went with my gf and we split the collard dip to start along with some beers.  I liked the dip even though I am not really big on dips in general, but I am a fan of collards so went with it.  For the main meal I went with the pot roast, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes.  It ALL was great,  The potatoes were dense, but somehow still creamy, the mac and cheese was homestyle and was perfect.  The roast was plentiful and the meat was tender and delicious.  Cant say enough about how good it was.  My gf got the eggplant sandwich and it was also delicious.  She chose the sweet potatoes and more collards (lots of greens for her).  Hers was great too.  The biscuit it comes with was on point as well.  Not a deviled egg fan so handed that off to her.  Overall the service was great and really enjoyed the decor and the atmosphere of the place, and the food was awesome.  GO TO DISH!!!!!",

    "text": "Loved this restaurant until today. Had the worst service I've ever had in a restaurant. Myself and three friends visited for lunch. Two in the party had never been to your restaurant. We were sat upstairs and waited on by a female bartender. From the beginning she acted like she'd rather be doing anything else...and honestly, she should be. 1. She forgot to bring a coffee over that was ordered. When we first attempted to get her attention--she put a finger to shush us because she was headed to another table. Whe we were finally able to ask her about the coffee, she commented that she didn't forget, but that she didn't have any decaf until now. What's funny about that is just before she was refilling decaf coffee at the table behind ours...it's kind of hard to hide the orange coffee pot. 2. When our food arrived, delivered by someone else after a long wait, she never once came to check on our table. We had to finally ask someone else to get her attention. 3. By the time she came over, two of us were done. One person had not eaten anything because her food had been bad and since our server never checked on us she sat there without decent food, the mashed cauliflower was stringy and the squash was covered in so much oil/butter it was inedible. When my friend who had been unable to eat told our server, the server rudely picked up my plate and the bad food plate. She looked at my friend and in a very nasty tone of voice goes \"Well, (exasperated breath) do you want to order something else or are you just done?\" and then looked at the other person who was finished and ordered her to hand over her empty plate. 4. Then in yet a nasty tone she rudely asked us if we wanted anything else or just our check. She was clearly through with our table. When she brought the tickets over, she handed them out to the wrong people--we had to correct that. And when she immediately returned and our money was not yet on each tablet, she made a loud groan, threw her hands in the air at our table and walked off. I've never left a restaurant without tipping. This table had two people in it who each had over 20+ years in the restaurant/service industry. And we were horrified at the level of disrespect and lack of service we were given today. And to top it off, when we asked for a manager we were told that there was no one in the building who could help us, but we were more than welcome to take a menu with the phone number on it if we felt the need to call later. How do you expect to run a restaurant and deal with problems if there is no management? Absolutely a horrible experience.",

Kitchen can be slow but it is small so cut them some slack. Husband can get his Yengling for $1.85 now tell me where else you can get that price?

The food is great, the wait staff friendly and don't mind soaking wet workout attire!!!  Their menu is a little bit of home cooking in the heart of plaza midwood!  My fave is the burrito, but have a killer burger selection and vegan options!  For those who have a fancier taste their menu does include a variety of fish and meats as well as other seafood options.   Their sides are of a good variety as well and reasonable pricing all around.  The decor is that of it's name sake... There's dishes all over the wall and even some paint by numbers sets which are displayed with grandeur!  for those interested in eating in the elements there is a nice outdoor patio with christmas lights still hanging!  On the second \"floor\" there is a nice bar area and more seating, and the art is picked out by one of the waittresses and all for sale.  I have actually bought some interesting artsy fartsy stuff there as well! I know it's definitely worth checking out and supporting Plaza Midwood!",

I live in Plaza Mid wood when I travel here from Greenville SC and I just  was too tired to venture very far. Actually I wanted steak but it seems that you are rather limited in this neighborhood for a really good steak.  I am strictly  a non drinker and something just didn't seem right about the Whiskey Warehouse. Besides I just don't want to spend a fortune at a chain.   Zada Jane's where I've had a great breakfast, was empty and too pricey for their steaks.  All this to say and ---- Hello! there in front of my eyes was trusty old Dish.  I guess it's going to be a chicken and dumplings night.  On the way in I note the special on one of those little sandwich boards outside on the side walk and decide that's it.  It was a brisket of beef with spicy orange BBQ sauce evening with a great side of potato salad and leafy side salad.  To the point, Lisa my waitress was great in helping me make up my mind and got my food to me in short order and also managed to chat briefly about the neighborhood. What was up, what was down etc etc.  My food? just great! Dish calls it \"comfort food\".  I looked around while I was eating and noted that the room was full of happy \"comfortable \" people.  In the back many of Dish's patrons seem to be thoroughly enjoying the bar.  The Place is solid! It's all about making sure that you enjoy your food and your visit.  If you have never been there, try it. You will be glad you did.  If you have not been there for a long time go back.  It's probably better than you remember.  BTW this place is great for lunch!.  Guess I bump my 3 1/2 stars up to four.  Yum Yum!",

Soup of the day was mashed cauliflower, and while it was not refined, it was pretty good. It at least had some cheesy flavor.   The veggie burger made of chickpeas was also limp and mushy with no flavor in itself. The southwestern toppings (guacamole, salsa, jalapenos, pepper jack) made it edible, but nothing special.   Mashed cauliflower was bland and tasteless and gritty, not creamy at all. Mac and cheese was as generic as possible. Couldn't tell if the green beans were canned or fresh, but they were also bland. Nothing great about the biscuit.   Grilled eggplant pita was unusual but no strong spices or flavoring.  Overall, pretty disappointing.",

Their deviled eggs are awesome and come with every meal.  With a sweet little patio, friendly servers  and a cheery decor this place makes me smile.",

Like, quicker than fast food drive-thru service. It kinda scared me actually, but after I tried a spoonful of the chicken-and-dumplings, I was fine. Listen, yum yum love. I didn't need to add a sprinkle of salt or pepper, which most places lack on. There were too many sides to choose from, so I decided to go with the mashed sweet potatoes. They could've used a bit more cinnamon though, problem solved after I asked for some and they delivered. Unfortunately, it seems like I was too late in the day to try the famed deviled eggs, but the biscuit was great and whatever they use to top it compliments it quite well.   I'm a fan and I will definitely be back next time I'm in Charlotte.",

It's a great burger topped with blue cheese. Plus, most meals come with a honey-glazed biscuit and deviled egg. If they've got it, be sure to try the sweet potato pie.   With $2 Yuengling pints and plenty of other good specials, Dish is also a good place to grab a few beers and start out your night in Plaza Midwood.",

Great place to go when you have no where else to go or are sitting in a car wondering where to go. Usually never a long wait and the staff moves quickly and are friendly.   The food was OK. The theme of the evening was not enough seasoning in all areas. Don't get me wrong...not bad, but the difference between 3 and 4 stars for me. Started with the fried green tomatoes and they were OK, though the dill horseradish sauce was great! Was going between the meatloaf and pot roast. Saw SO MANY orders of the meatloaf pass me by, but decided on the pot roast instead. Came out with pot roast and gravy, as well as some mashed potatoes and a side. Went with the mac & cheese. The pot roast had good flavor with the gravy, though the mac & cheese and \"potato scoop\" were less to be desired. Added salt & pepper to everything. The biscuit was really good and just came out of the oven, and who doesn't love a deviled egg!   Will I be returning...you bet! It's cheap and the food is good. Looking forward to the meatloaf next time! Oh yeah...$2 PBR!",

Patterned plastic tablecloths and floral-themed china plates hung on the wall contrast with a long beer bar complete with neon signage that is tucked in the upper backhand corner of this otherwise unassuming building.  In this study of contrasts, however, the food is distinctly Southern.  That means leave the calorie-counter at home.  Meatloaf, Chicken and dumplings, salmon cakes, and chicken salad are all regulars here.  I am partial to the creamy tomato soup with half sandwich, myself, but everything is served in ample portion sizes and no dining companion of mine has had any major complaints with their fare.  Even the sides- everything from green beans to sweet potato mash, are served with Southern flair (which usually means plenty of butter and salt).  Don't miss the biscuit and deviled egg that come with most entrees.    The lunch time crowd, a regular Charlotte mix of ties in tightly pressed white shirts and those with a swath of purple hair and multiple piercings, is yet another mash up that just seems to work- service is fast and non-fussy.  I rarely wait more than a couple minutes for a table but the place always seems full.    Great place to take out of town guests- if not for the mix of people then for the Southern kitsch the fills every corner.  In many ways, this restaurant is the epitome of Plaza Midwood- old Southern roots with the vibe of the young and trendy pulsing throughout.    The bottom line is this place is affordable and tasty- 2 things that should never contrast.  Luckily for Dish, they go hand in hand.",

    "text": "Dish was definitely a Charlotte destination after seeing it on TV. Chicken and dumplins is one of my favorite Southern dishes, so how could I pass up an opportunity to partake of it at a DDD eatery?  The food is affordable, the vibe is casual, and the service is great. They also have a nice variety of alcohol to choose from. They do local beers, a few wines, and some mixed drinks; just enough to pair with your simple grub.  Dish's menu is fairly straightforward, with mostly Southern dishes and a handful of unique options. I went with the C&D with a side of macaroni and cheese. Every dish comes with a biscuit and a deviled egg.  The deviled egg was somewhat bland, but creamy. The biscuit was very buttery and soft on the inside, but it was a bit dry on the exterior. The macaroni and cheese was really creamy, but it lacked a cheesy and hearty flavor.  The poultry and pastry was disappointing. The dumplings were extremely tough, almost doughy, and the little amount of chicken in the stew was somewhat bland. I enjoyed the well-seasoned stew a lot, but the stuff inside was sub-par.  The bourbon-vanilla sweet potato pie was pretty good and unique. It was a thick and tall slice with a pecans and glaze on top with a really rich and sweet crust. I wish the crust was a little less gummy and sweet and more crumbly. The flavor of the filling itself was spot on.  This joint definitely offers some classic Southern fare,  but the preparation and textures could use some work. I went at an off-time, so maybe I caught the bad end of the kitchen, but I did not think my meal was particularly special.",

    "text": "So, we went to Dish because my roommate and I were both not yet feeling fat (and sassy) from the day's food and it was both not super greasy and within biking distance. Stepping into Dish was like stepping into a memory of my grandma's kitchen...or at least what I imagine that would have been like if my grandma was from the Carolinas, not a diabetic from Brooklyn.  The simple design of Dish's facade carries inside, where the dinning area is plain, with occasional infestations of kitsch. The servers are friendly and quick.   My roommate had the blacken chicken with green beans and mashed potato. I am told they were tasty. I decided to go for the 3 veggie plate with smokey lima beans, squash casserole and collard greens because I am a sucker for fresh veggies that I don't have to wash or worry about keeping fresh. The greens were solidly tasty in an appropriately unremarkable way. I do not know what they put the lima beans in to make them smokey (I surmised \"liquid meat\" at dinner) but I'm not terribly fond of it. Once I removed them from the excess sauce they were much better and I ate them all (don't you fear). The squash casserole was heavenly and if I knew how to make it I would grow fat on it.  Did I mention that both dinners came with a delicious biscuit and a deviled egg? I love both of those things and haven't had the latter in far to long. Pleasant surprise.  All in all, Dish did not blow my mind but I didn't want it to. It was excellent at being comfortable.",

    "text": "I'm not from the South, so you may say I'm crazy and chalk this review up to, \"she's a Yankee\", but Dish didn't impress this girl.  Let's start out on a high note, though, shall we? The potato cakes were seriously delicious...I had honestly never heard of (much less tried) one of these delectables before coming to Dish (I know, I know...Yankee), and was...well, I can't say pleasantly surprised, because there's nothing surprising about something in the mashed potato family being yummy, but was delighted nonetheless. It was all down-hill from there...  There was nothing horribly and obviously wrong with the meal...let me say that up front. Well, service kinda sucked, but as far as the food goes, it wasn't overtly awful. It was...hmm, how do I explain this? You know when you were a kid, and you'd go to your friend's house for dinner, and their mom would cook, and you'd eat the food because it was there and you knew you were supposed to, but all you kept thinking the whole time was how it just wasn't how your mom made it? That's something akin to how I felt about Dish -- it was passable, but the whole time I kept thinking that I could get better pot roast almost anywhere else (such as Jar restaurant in L.A...now THAT is pot roast!!).   Overall it was just sub-par...like they had somebody's mom in the kitchen making it. I love moms, don't get me wrong....but moms aren't chefs! They're moms. I expect higher quality and better presentation from a chef that I'm paying for my food.  I'm willing to give it another chance...like I said, perhaps I'm being too harsh (living in a city with some of the best cuisine in the country spoils me, I know), but I personally think Dish needs to step up their game. Who says comfort food can't be exquisitiely prepared and superbly delicious? Not me!",

    "text": "I ate at Dish for the first time in January, after living in the neighborhood for two and a half years. No idea why I waited. I think it always looked closed -- maybe due to the small entrance compared to Thomas Street Tavern and other local restaurants. Don't let the cinder block facade scare you away.  I enjoyed the warm pimento cheese appetizer, the biscuits, and a veggie plate. The server mentioned that the lima beans would have a cream sauce ... i enjoyed the beans very much, but I appreciated the heads up in case I was a pickier eater used to simpler beans. The collards were delicious.  Service was great. We had a very nice waitress who was constantly moving, cleaning, checking on everyone, and she was very accommodating with requests.  I've been back once, and that time I tried the chipotle flank steak. The black bean salsa was the key! Delicious, and generous portions of steak. My companion had the cajun meatloaf and really liked it, but it was heavy overall with mashed potatoes. Definitely a meal for an evening you don't plan to stay out too late! We came home and crashed.  Over all, I'd call it southern, almost soul food, in a casual but sophisticated environment. With a full bar! Very low-key and relaxing atmosphere. I will return!",

    "text": "Okay, so after hearing all the good things about this place I went up there today around 11am. Not too many people there, which was good, and I was greeted right away by someone who might have not had a great morning. Whatevs, I am here for the great food that I heard about not the greeter. I asked for a booth and was told they reserve that for two or more people, which was fine with me as it was only me and I understand that these booths are big and should be for more people. I also heard that you guys make your own desserts and that the Key Lime Pie was awesome! I looked there first and saw it was on the menu so I was excited. Then my back started acting up and was starting to spasm so I had to leave. The lady was coming to bring me some utensils and get my drink order(I think) and I told her that the seat was hurting my back and I know you guys had the policy for the booths so I had to go. As I was walking out the door the light skinned black lady that had greeted me was saying in a loud voice\" sir, if you had told me about your back I would have seated you in a booth\" and I said \"it is okay, I understand your policy and left.\" This entire experience was fine with me. You guys have a policy and I am okay with it, and I would also like for you to know that I did not give you this low of a review because of what happened inside Dish. The reason I gave you this bad review is because as I am walking to my car the same light skinned black lady is yelling down the street \"IF YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME I COULD HAVE SEATED YOU DIFFERENTLY\" I held my hand up to stop her because again, my back was hurting/spasming at this point and it did not matter where I sat I needed to walk it out and let the muscles relax. It was at this point that she yells, \"I HOPE YOU CHOKE ON YOUR FUCKING LUNCH YOU\" and I could not understand what else she said because it was inaudible. I have no idea who this person with the corn rows was but if that is the kind of language and attitude that you guys allow at your place of business just because I chose to not eat there then I do not want to be a patron in your establishment. It is sad too because it seemed that everyone else from the woman with the cool tattoos and the waitress were having a good time.",

They are known for their chicken and dumplings, but the whole menu is solid.  Personally, it is hard for me to avoid the cajun meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  The biggest decision is whether or not to save the devil egg and honey glazed biscuit for before or after the main course.  There are always delicious fresh veggies incorporated into their side dishes for healthy tastiness.  Its going to be hard to do, but try and save room for the desserts.  Super rich key lime pie will hit the spot and you cannot go wrong with the vanilla bourbon sweet potato pie, I am told.  The kitchy decor of vintage plates and velvet paintings will almost make you feel like someone's grandma is cranking out the grub in the kitchen.",

    "text": "Stopped in for an early dinner one Saturday.  I had seen the restaurant on DDD and had been wanting to visit since I moved down here.  And I finally got it on my calendar.  Things were pretty quiet when I arrived at 4:30pm.  It is apparently seat yourself as I stood at the cash register for about a minute before the hostess slid a menu across the counter and told me to seat my self.  Please don't be mad hostess lady, I would have been happy to seat myself if you had a sign...  I grabbed a table and perused the menu to pick my side.  I had already decided that I was getting the chicken and dumplings, but I didn't know what to put with it.  There are at least 15 sides for you to choose from and I settled on the squash casserole.  It took less than minutes for my food to arrive.  The chicken and dumplings were fantastic.  There was a ton of chicken and I loved the amount of black pepper in the mix (Note:  It may be a little strong for some people).  The squash casserole was not quite what I expected, but was still good.  It had a much more pureed consistency than I was expecting, but it was still pretty good.  The biscuit was okay.  Not the best biscuit I've had, but it served a purpose in scraping the bowl when I was done.  I'll come back.  I can eat that chicken and dumplings all day long.  Service was passable, nothing spectacular.  I'll sit at the counter next time.",

The atmosphere is unassuming and homey and the food is delicious!  I had a mahi special with mac & cheese while my friend had chicken & dumplings and declared them better than her grandmother's.  We both had the strawberry/peach pie...also fabulous.  The only very minor thing I'd say is that it isn't a good place to go if you're looking for a quiet atmosphere.  It was a bit on the noisy side which didn't detract in any way from my experience.  Looking forward to future visits.",

Instead, Hannah sent the waitress back without coming to speak to us, offering a 25% discount. I explained to the waitress that I did not request a discount (I had already provided payment information prior to requesting the manager). I, again, requested to have a conversation the manager. When Hannah arrived at my table, I detailed the poor service and  the delay on food that I experienced. I also asked why she did not come speak to me when I requested her to? She explained that \"This is how we do things here\" (implying standard practice is to offer a discount instead of a conversation and apology). When I asked Hannah to repeat her name for me (so I could take note of it) she turned her back and walked away from me. Upon exiting the restaurant, I approached Hannah and informed her that I was aware of her name (despite her refusal to continue our conversation) and would be placing this review. Hannah then FOLLOWED ME OUTSIDE the restaurant! Hannah began to tell me that I did not  understand that the discount was standard practice. Needless to say, following a customer out of a restaurant is unprofessional and did not go well with me. In fact, following me out of the restaurant was a threatening situation, and greatly escalated the situation/  original service issue I had.  I am in the process of contacting owner, Penny Craver, to address the service issue and threatening manner of her management staff.",

We hurried and went in to make order.  My partner, she had cajun spicy meatloaf with potatoes and I had country fried steak wit potato, we both have sides on mac cheese. We have free biscuit and devil eggs. Food great! Atmosphere great! Service fast and great! I gave 4 stars is because of hard to find parking. I had seen other people have the same problem.

My boyfriend enjoyed the Cajun meatloaf sandwich with a fried egg and ghost pepper cheese, like he does every single time. Our bill was less than $20 for this amazing meal. Jessie C waited on us, like he has many times, he has a genuine smile on his face! You can feel like he loves interacting with people and is always patient with our menu questions! We will continue to return and encourage other Yelpers to do the same.   Side note: they also have local artist pieces of work hanging on the walls, these are for sell, make sure you browse at them!!",

    "text": "Man I wish yelp allows us to give half stars (are you listening yelp corp?) but I would give Dish 3.5 stars. I have been wanting to go to Dish for years and today I finally got the opportunity. We came in for lunch and there was an amplitude of seating available. We are some hungry folks and ordered quite a bit of stuff. Here's the low down:  Apps: Fried Green Tomatoes - I'm a big fan of fried green tomatoes and these were just a-ok. A bit sour than what I would like but the horseradish sauce really balanced it out.  Entrees: Chicken & Dumplings: My favorite out of the 3 entrees that we tried. It tasted very homey; just like how grandma would make it. I wished it had a bit of veggies in it (like carrots and celery chunks). If it did, it would be on point. Country Fried Steak: Not the best that I've had but it was pretty good. The gravy made the dish and the mashed potatoes that accompanied the dish still had potato skins in it (kudos point!). Shrimp & Grits: My least favorite out of the 3. I love myself some shrimp and grits and someone was just off. The grits taste bland and not very creamy. I always finish my food (and I wasn't able to) so I was a bit disappointed.  All entrees came with a deviled egg (yum) and a biscuit (even yummier!). Some of the entrees came with side dishes and we tried the mac & cheese and collard greens. They tasted alright; nothing to write home about.  Would I come again? Maybe when Charlotte runs out of option for southern food and I doubt that will happen anytime soon.  While the food tasted good, it was nothing special and we all know that Charlotte has a lot more to offer.",

Sit there if you have an appreciation of local art. The food is why I come back time and time again.  The pot roast is the best I have ever had ... Ever.   The steak salad with their home made smoked tomato basil dressing is awesome.  The chicken and dumplings rock.  I venture off with the special from time to time but mostly stick to those 3 dishes.

    "text": "We decided to come here last minute for a quick weekend lunch yesterday finally! We were quickly seated by the hostess and greeted by our quirky, nice server. She gave us plenty of time to decide, everything looked good it was hard to choose. I ended up ordering the salmon patties with mac and cheese and the special hashbrown casserole of the day. The bf ordered the chicken and dumplings with a side of the infamous mashed potatoes. The food took forever to come out, my stomach was literally grumbling. But, when it did it was a lot of food. Not as piping hot as I would have liked though. The loved the consistency and size of the salmon patties, there was good seasoning in there as well but, I wish they used fresh salmon instead of canned. Would have made a huge difference. My sides were good, had to add some seasoning to the mac and cheese and the hashbrown casserole was delish. I did not like the deviled egg, it was very bland and hard to eat.   My bf really enjoyed his chicken and dumplings (not bad for 8 bucks) he however, and this is where I docked a star and a half, hated the mashed potatoes. It seems like someone smashed a potato crudely and placed it into the side cup. No seasoning or creamy component, and quite frankly it wasn't mashed with the proper smooth consistency one looks for in the traditional mashed potatoes. I had to play with it and had to add butter, salt, and pepper myself. Some cream would have been nice but, I didn't bother and just managed with what I had. Other than that, the biscuits were amazing...dirty little secret: I wanted to order more. I wasn't a fan of the white pepper gravy, I think I have been spoiled by the Flying Biscuit in this sense.   The dining room makes me want to kick back on the porch with some lemonade. Best part, our bill came out to under $20. For all that food, its worth the price. Will be back to try more.",

I was so excited when I found out about this place it seems like Charlotte is always coming out with some new dining place in this area everytime I come home.   I ordered a vegan meal and was impressed when the waiter/bartender knew what a flexitarian was! The food was very well seasoned and I have to find out whom they order their grits from because they were seriously the most amazing tasting grits I had ever eaten.  I forgot to ask what they use in their mac and cheese but I would imagine it was daiya. It of course did not look like my husband's ooey gooey mac and cheese but was freaking amazing! I mean seriously I can't stop thinking about it.  The collards were a good but better with vinegar which they had on hand. Thank the goddess for the south and vinegar and collards. These collards were lightly seasoned so if you do not like yours heavily seasoned they would be perfect. If you are a truly southerner just add vinegar and taste perfection.  I could go on and on about this place but I will end by saying if you live in the are or will be visiting the area this is a great southern comfort food place to try with option for many different types of diets.",

Ordered the salmon cakes, with green beans, mac and cheese and it came with a biscuit. Salmon cakes were top notch. I enjoyed the green beans but one star removed for the mac and cheese, which was subpar. Almost made up for by some sort of butter that came with the biscuit that tasted absolutely divine!

Today I visited Charlotte and went because it was one of my favorite restaurants. Another nostalgic date with my partner. She's a chess teacher and we play every day--a game takes about 20 minutes. We start playing chess and order our food (which was tasty) and before we even start eating our waitress starts asking where we are going to play. \"Right here\" I responded -- she goes on about how we should go play at the grocery store and just anywhere else. It was a bit hard to believe what she was saying so we gave her the benefit of the doubt that she was confused . She returns when we're partly done eating and says \"To answer your question, not that is was a question, here are some other places you can go play chess at\". At which point I inquired whether she was telling us to not play chess here. The answer was yes. The date was ruined. We promptly left. Needless to say, take your business to Zada Janes across the street--it's very similar and you won't be treated poorly.  We were there maybe 20 minutes.",

It's just simple ingredients put together carefully and it really shows. Give it a go if you're around Plaza Midwood looking for a relatively cheap meal.",

    "text": "I grew up in Charlotte, but for some reason had never heard of the restaurant (what a shame). Stopped in today with my dad to grab a bite to eat for lunch and I must say I am a fan. Yes, it is a southern comfort food concept, but it doesn't feel like an outdated place. The vibe is some sort of traditional chic, hard to describe, but I like it.   Their menus is actually pretty varied plenty of vegetarian options and meat options and they had like 4 specials of the day! I ended up getting the vegetable plate with collards, kale/garbanzo salad, daily soup (ginger carrot), and mac and cheese. The plate also came with a biscuit and deviled egg. A lot of food for $8.00 and I was impressed that it was all fresh. Often when you get comfort food it is heavy and greasy, but everything here was pretty light - even the biscuit was light and fluffy!   Oh and the carrot soup I mentioned, the carrot soup was to die for...seriously. I might have to drive back down there later this evening and get a bowl or two to go!   This will be my go to place for Americana for the next few weeks! Oh and they are progressive in the causes they support, something I can get on board with!",

We were seated immediately and greeted by a very kind server. We ordered our drinks -- I got a ginger ale -- and she apologized for the wait in bringing them over even though it had only been a few minutes.   When it came time to order, I asked for the grilled chicken livers. My entree came with a biscuit and a deviled egg. Since I'm gluten-free, I asked to omit the biscuit; I knew the rest of my entree would be enough to fill me up. Our server asked, \"instead of the biscuit, would you like an additional deviled egg?\" My heart skipped a beat. OF COURSE I'd like another deviled egg! My answer to deviled eggs will always be a resounding \"yes.\"  Our food came out quickly and looked wonderful. Everything was an appropriate temperature and it was pleasantly presented. My second deviled egg was just as delightful as the first. We were in and out in the perfect amount of time to still catch our 7:30 movie, but never felt rushed.   I'm already looking forward to another visit to Dish. The prices are reasonable, the food is simple but lovely, and the service is fantastic. Go.",

    "text": "As all of my other reviews go, this was another excursion for my girlfriend and I about twenty minutes away from UNC Charlotte.  I had really spent hours looking for places to try, giving myself some rigorous criteria involving price, type of food, and really just looking to see if the menu was appealing.  I found many places that looked somewhat interesting, but something told me to continue searching.    As she was about to get off work, I came upon Dish's entry on Yelp, and of course I went straight to their menu.  The deal with this place is that it is a southern restaurant, and incredibly homey.  I work at The Whiskey Jar in downtown Charlottesville, Virginia, a place where I believe southern food is exemplified, and thus I know my way around the type of food (even if I am a vegetarian).  When we arrived, the place was naturally lit, and it looked like someone's one-story house had been opened up so that it was one large room (with a landing up some stairs), and there were things hanging on the walls everywhere.  Just like the Whiskey Jar, there were things hanging on the wall everywhere, so that the place began to resemble a museum!  The tables, however, were set up simply, alluding to the fact that people should come here to focus on their food, not worry about other things that do not seem to matter.  People were running around and really looked like they were working hard, which, to me, is always a great sign.  We were seated almost immediately, and our server came right around.  Because this seemed to be such a great find, and even though we usually do things on a budget, I was convinced that we needed to order an appetizer, and the fried green tomatoes (a staple of the summer menu at the Whiskey Jar) called our name.  The only thing that we were skeptical about was the heat of the sauce, but our server helped us through deciding what was best.  They came out promptly and tasted great.  You cannot go wrong with something hot, fresh, and crispy!  I was so interested in the veggie loaf sandwich, and my girlfriend was interested in their veggie burrito, and of course we immediately made up our minds to order them.  When my veggie loaf sandwich came out, I could not believe how thick of a piece it was.  It looked ready to eat, and I jumped right in (I really do not think I stopped until I was done).  This is by far the best veggie-patty like food I have ever had, especially because of the spices, and my girlfriend agrees.  Her burrito was prepared perfectly, and although she could not finish it all, she did later that night (commenting how burritos are normally not the best to eat leftover, but this one certainly was worth it).  Drawing on my experience with southern food from the Whiskey Jar, as well as being raised on the stuff (especially sweet potato pie, I knew that their vanilla bourbon sweet potato pie was also something I had to try, no matter how full I was; I knew this before I even came in the place!  When it came out, it had walnuts on top, so my girlfriend could not indulge as much as me, but she tried some of it that did not have nuts on it, and enjoyed it so much that she risked another bite.  Needless to say, this pie did not stick around long.  It was another level than my mom's own, but she is insistent on imitating it.  One thing I would like to note is that you should tell your server everything at once, because they may not get back to you for a while, running around as much as they do.  This is not necessarily a problem to me, as I know the service at the Whiskey Jar is the same way, because it is a small place and thus has a limited number of staff at times.  Again, anyone who is halfway understanding, or is not in such a rush, should be perfectly fine at this place!  I recommend trying it if you are in the area, or even if you want to go somewhere out of the way like we did!  I do apologize for not having any pictures of the food, but it did not stick around long at all!",

Where are the flaky, yummy biscuits? It was as if the server could read our minds... he said, \"we have biscuits in the oven right now. We'll bring them out as soon as they're ready.\" Crisis averted. Let's move on.  I love Dish. It almost feels like you're in a family member's kitchen. Cozy, welcoming. The only thing I don't like about it: they're closed on Sundays.   I love the chicken and dumplings. Every bite feels like a hug. I've been hooked ever since I watched the triple D episode here. If it's good enough for Guy, then it's a must try. I'm also a big fan of the salmon cakes and collard greens. My friend Jason gets chicken fried steak without the gravy. Blasphemy. Pure blasphemy.  Back to the biscuit situation... in the middle of our meal, here comes a plate of heaven. Warm, delicious biscuits. It was well worth the wait. Now if Jason wouldn't have been so selfish and ordered his gravy on the side... it would have been damn near perfection.  The workers are incredibly friendly. We are always well taken care of here and everyone is so nice. Parking can be a little tricky in this area. Come with patience.   I'm looking forward to Spring and enjoying my biscuits on the patio.",

This place was recommended by a coworker for yummy southern comfort food, and apparently was also featured on Diners, Drive ins, and Dives.  The restaurant seemed pretty packed when we got there but luckily we were seated right away.  We ordered fried green tomatoes ($5.19), chicken & dumplings ($8.29), and the flank steaK ($10).  All entrees were under $10 which was pretty cool, very affordable.  Food was alright.  BF and I weren't too fond of the horseradish sauce for the fried green tomatoes though.  The chicken and dumplings is very similar to arroz caldo, which is a popular Filipino porridge dish, but the steak was pretty yums.  Mac n cheese was great too.  Decent place overall but not sure I'd come back if I were to travel back to Charlotte.",

    "text": "Went here a few years ago for the first time, and tried it again about 2 weeks ago and it was exactly like I remembered: Meh... Food was under seasoned and was just ok. The kicker for me was the Vanilla Bourbon Sweet Potato Pie...it was bland and not sweet at all for a dessert. After tasting it 2 times and mentioning it to the waitress, she only apologized and did nothing more. I mentioned it to another staff member who said that their policy is \"As long as it's cooked properly, then there's nothing we can do\"....all the while another employee stood there rolling her eyes at me and my complaint.  I'm sure it's a great place and decent people work there...but all of this over a $4 dessert? That's silly to lose a customer over but they've certainly lost me. I would have tried it a 3rd time even with the lack of seasoning, but it's not worth it after not taking a tasteless, $4 dessert off of my bill.",

    "text": "I live in Portland, OR but have family near Charlotte.  I was in town on business and needed to select a place for dinner convenient for a friend who lives in NoDa (North Davidson).  I had been to Dish several years ago and recalled it as super yummy.  When I suggested it as a place to meet, turns out she eats at Dish regularly!!  This place was as I remembered- comfortable and homey.  Our waitress knew my friend and remembered her fav appetizer- the Pimento cheese spread served cold with pita bread and chips.  It was excellent.  For my dinner I ordered the chicken fried steak & gravy with mashed red potatoes that comes with a deviled egg & a biscuit.  I ordered an extra side of mac & cheese with sweet tea to drink.  The tea was perfectly sweetened.  The chicken friend steak was cooked perfectly & the gravy was spot on.  Great deviled egg & I could have made a meal out of a dozen of those biscuits.  I love mashed red potatoes these did need a little salt.  But that mac & cheese... don't laugh, I dreamt about it that night!!  All in all, so happy to 'rediscover' Dish.  If you are looking for good southern food and don't want to pay the steep prices in Uptown (what the locals call their downtown area) I strongly suggest paying Dish a visit.  I plan on coming back on my next visit to Charlotte.    PS- Aside from the good ole fashined southern food they also have a bit of Mexican on the menu as well!!",

    "text": "You know that 'go to' restaurant that's always in the back of your mind when you're trying to figure out where you want to get a bite to eat?  Well that restaurant is Dish for me.  It doesn't mean I always go there, but it's always up for consideration.  I'm a southern/soul food junky and Dish hits the spot.  All the comfort food side dishes (mac n' cheese, mashed potatoes, greens) are really good.  They also serve you a hot buttered biscuit and deviled egg with pretty much every entree.  That's pretty unique!  My 2 favorite entrees are the country fried steak ($8) & cajun meatloaf ($9), both come with 2 sides as well as the aforementioned biscuit/deviled egg.  That's such a great deal.  So much food, so little money!  I also consider the country fried steak the best around, and I have fetish for the stuff.....  The breakfast on Saturday is basic, but solid.  The bloody mary bar is cool as they have many options to customize your 'hair of the dog'.",

This time, I got the cajun meatloaf with mashed taters and a side of mac n cheese.  It was amazing!  The biscuit that came with it helped me make sure nothing was left on the plate.  We also had the fried green maters for an app.  They were so good that my wife, who cannot stand to eat tomatoes, had some.  They were extra good with their dipping sauce.

I was charmed by the biscuit and deviled egg offered with each entree. The desserts looked great, buy most of us were too full to try them.  Overall, tasty food with a relaxed atmosphere.

I was born in the nether regions of Brooklyn NY and came South 30 years ago. I have never had a real liking for foods of the South but my tastes have changed over the years. I still wont eat grits but the chicken fried steak here at Dish was just awesome! I ate every morsel of it ---the mashed potatoes were good too . I had carb overload and also asked for mac and cheese. My friend had the pot roast and lima beans but ordered a side of the mashed cauliflower. Now, she did not care for it but please folks, just try it. It is like nothing else and I wished I had ordered it instead of the mac and cheese---it's that good!   One day I will come back an order the chicken and dumplings as this is supposed to be the house favorite by diners. If you are looking for decor, well, don't expect much. It's a homey little joint with a bar in the back of the restaurant. Not a dive but a step up. By the way,we had an awesome server, so Sasha, if you read this, my compliments to you. You are just the bomb! Thanks for a very enjoyable afternoon at Dish.",

The food is almost uniformly good across a broad array of southern favorites and very reasonably priced.  I'll just list some of my favorites.  I have three most common orders.  The first is the chicken and dumplings, which is mostly big shreds of white meat chicken in a thick gravy with dumplings.  It comes with two sides, a deviled egg, and a biscuit (lightly brushed with honey butter and DELICIOUS - now I'm drooling).  My second is the chicken livers (also with two sides, egg, and a biscuit).  The livers are dusted in cornmeal and cooked on the griddle with skewers.  They normally come with a remoulade, but I prefer the beef gravy, which they happily provide.  My last favorite is the cajun meatloaf, which comes with mashed potatoes, brown gravy, and a spicy catchup top.    They have a significant section for vegetarians, including a spinach salad with a smoked, sun-dried tomato vinaigrette that you would swear has bacon in it, a burger, a burrito, a quesadilla, soups, and the infamous veggie plate.  Their selection of veggies is quite extensive, and thankfully avoids gratuitous meat.  My favorites are the squash casserole (onions, cheese, breadcrumbs baked with big squash chunks), carrots (sweet and tender), and whatever smoky vegetable they may have on special.    If you are looking for someplace comfortable, filling, satisfying, and unpretentious, Dish will probably fit the bill.",

    "text": "My husband and I are big fans of Diners Drive Ins and Dives and this is the only place on the show in Charlotte which we had not yet tried.  So hubby says tonight we are eating at Dish!  And I was SO looking forward to it.....I love salmon and have eaten and made salmon cakes (or salmon patties) all my life.  We both also love fried green tomatoes.  We were seated quickly and our server was quick to greet us and suggest a drink special and their \"signature\" app fried green tomatoes - we said \"YES\" to both.  The drink was good.  The app was not.  Practically tasteless.  The deviled eggs were also very, very bland.  Entrees:  hubby ordered the pork chop which was pretty good.  Very, very thin but tasted ok.  His mashed potatoes were horrid.  And we both got pinto beans as a side - I make these homemade myself all the time - and these were most certainly from a can.  Tender, but extremely bland and in a clear-ish liquid.  The salmon patties I ordered were just awful.  I really wanted to like them.  But they were clearly from canned salmon - not fresh as was demonstrated on Diners Drive Ins and Dives show - and tasted old and somewhat \"fish-y\".  The word that came to mind was \"cat food\" and I was disappointed to say the least.  The orange butter was really tasty and I put some of it on the hours old hard biscuit, and that was ok.  The mac and cheese was ok.  Reminded me of cafeteria fare from college.  I suspect there was some canned cheese sauce in it.  The waitress up to this point was friendly.  But when she stopped back by and I asked her if fresh salmon is used to make the salmon patties, she hesitated and then said \"Well, yeah, I think so.\"  As a server, shouldn't you know for sure? Especially since this particular dish was featured on TV show highlighting the use of fresh ingredients?  I told her I could not eat these that they were just really bad.  And then we got the cold shoulder attitude.  I was trying to be as nice as possible and when she FINALLY asked if I wanted something else, I asked for just the protein part of chicken fried steak - this was brought out promptly but with a nary a friendly air to be found.  When she stopped back by to ask us if we wanted dessert (again with cool attitude) and we politely declined, she put the check down and told us to pay her.  Well, when we looked at the bill we realized she had rung up three entrees and charged us for all three.  So I go up to the front where the register is and after standing there for about 10 minutes the hostess finally asked if she could help us - I explained that I was willing to pay for two entrees but not three, especially when the salmon had been so bad and I had not eaten but a few bites of the salmon.  She agreed to have someone remove it from the bill. We waited another 20 minutes or so for this to be accomplished while standing there at the counter... at the front ....with the owner (I recognized her from the show) and our waitress passing us repeatedly and NEVER asking if we needed assistance.  Finally the hostess re-appeared and asked us if we needed anything and I told her, \"Look, we just want to pay and go - we have been standing here waiting for the corrected bill for quite some time.\" Hostess gets the bill corrected and waitress now must bring it over to me.  I paid and we left.  This was a 25 minute drive across town for us and we were really looking forward to it.  The entire evening ended up being a big disappointment.  The service started out good but as soon as I didn't like my entree it soured. And the food was pretty bad. My husband and I could not believe this place was featured on a TV show.  Not sure what happed here - but we will not be back...There are a TON of unique places to eat in this town - we avoid chain restaurants and there are still plenty of great places to go - especially in this neighborhood that offer up flavorful fare and goof customer service.",

Bloody mary bar is fun on saturdays. Potato cake appetizer could serve as a whole meal. Although the place is consistently busy during prime dining hours, service is always solid. Chicken and dumplings are the tits. Its places like these that make plaza midwood the coolest 2 miles in town.",

    "text": "After six months back in the CLT, I think I'm finally coming to terms with the seemingly new Charlotte cuisine item that is the \"Veggie Plate.\"  I've been to a number of places now where one of the vegetarian options is listed as the Veggie Plate (choice of 3 veggie sides or 4 veggie sides).  Out of principal, I've never ordered one since I've always been a little annoyed by the idea that vegetarians must only eat sides, but last night, at Dish for the first time, I caved.  Mac and cheese (delicious), squash casserole (unidentifiably delicious), and stewed tomatoes and okra (that tasted just like my mom's veggie soup) were accompanied by Dish's signature deviled egg and biscuit.  I give up.  I give up to you, Veggie Plate.  Because you are, in certain mood, truly delicious.  I appreciate that Dish treats the Veggie Plate as a legitimate entree and allows its biscuit and deviled egg to accompany it (as the biscuit is one of the best I've ever had).  I also appreciate that Dish has a number of other veg-friendly options on the menu.  Husband ordered the tomato soup and grilled pimento cheese sandwich (he can't resist that pairing), and both were excellent.  I'm so relieved they make an in-house veggie burger (seriously... there's no excuse not to), and I can't resist anything with black beans (the nachos look fantastic), so I imagine we'll be returning to Dish to sample some of the other menu items.  (Good prices, too, and the decor is classic old school North Carolina.)",

    "text": "Dish is AMAZING... sometimes.  The problem with Dish is that the quality of the food varies greatly.   The first time my wife and I ate here we fell in love with the place.  In subsequent visits the food has ranged from great to ... mediocre.  I'm sticking with 4 stars here because the BBQ pulled pork sandwich is always fantastic, and it is my favorite dish.   The squash casserole can be great on a good day, or bland on a bad day.  The pot roast has been pretty awesome on a regular basis.  And the meatloaf is good.  Service is a great, and the ambiance is pretty cozy during quiet times, and even fairly pleasant when the place is hopping.  Oh, and the biscuits are some of the best in Charlotte.  This restaurant really needs to do some quality control on their kitchen.   If they were at their best all the time, I would easily give them 5 stars.",

    "text": "Allow me to go ahead and dish on Dish. Dish is indeed A-OK in my book.   With kitschy decor, down home grub and solid service, Dish is a solid choice for an affordable and tasty fare in Plaza Midwood. Hubs and I rolled into Dish after three failed attempts at other local restaurants on a Saturday evening. I was not in the mindset to wait an HOUR for a table, so Dish is where we landed!  We grabbed an affordable drink at the bar and waited about 10 minutes for our table - that's a score at 8 pm on a Saturday night. The menu is filled with a variety of options ranging from Fried Green Tomatoes, to Pot Roast, to Shrimp and Grits. While it's definitely not a low cal location, Dish has a variety of dishes that will please just about any palate.   Our server was kind and quick to offer suggestions for both appetizer and main course. We started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes. Overall, not a bad dish. Small fried greenies with a tangy dill dipping sauce. I was hoping for more flavor in the breading - from what I could tell it was just flour and egg...no pepper, no additional spices, etc.   About 15 minutes later I dug into my Chicken & Dumplings - a moderate and well priced portion of the milky soup stuffed with long bits of shredded chicken and hearty dumplings. It was well made and hearty - but again, it was lacking flavor. Boatloads of pepper were added. For my side, I chose the sweet potato mash which was indeed sweet - almost too sweet for my liking! And that's saying quite a bit.   The gratis honey biscuit and deviled egg really were stars of the meal, though! The biscuit came out warm with a honey glaze...I promptly devoured my biscuit in 30 seconds flat. YUM. The deviled egg was super fresh and perfectly crafted.   So, while Dish wasn't the greatest meal I've ever had it was comforting, solid and very affordable. If I find myself in a pinch next time I'm in PM, Dish is on my short list.",

The restaurant looks like your grandmother's house, a charming little place with pictures and knick-knacks on the walls. They had a menu with a lot of variety and being vegetarian, it was great to see many vegetarian options. The Black Bean Nachos are probably the best nachos I've ever had anywhere, ever. I loved that they had deviled eggs; you don't see that often in restaurants, especially with the option to order as a little as just three.   Overall, we had a great time with friendly staff and great food.",

That in its self is very sellable to a broad range of folks, count me in as one of them. Scatch this off as a solid 4.5  Service is eh... pretty much that of a diner. Nothing insanelyly spectacularr food came out hot and fast and let me ell you their soup hit the spit. It was a hearty broth- based white bean and porktastic offering. A cup of that and a couple o bites of that collars dip and i was good to go. Note to dish: y'all need bacon in your green beans",

This doesn't surprise us seeing as the food is amazing and it was also a Saturday night. I tried all new stuff tonight to branch out of my comfort zone. I usually order the Cajun meatloaf (beyond amazing) but today I tried the pimiento cheeseburger. I do not regret the choice one bit! It was delicious and everything I could have asked for. So far we have never had a horrible experience and will continue to go.",
