The Friend Zone margarita was excellent - did not have that fake sour mix taste. Very delicious!  I ordered the Long Duck Dong (my favorite - sweet and spicy steak), Fat Guy In A Little Coat (marinated steak), and the Stage Five Clinger (crispy chicken). I loved all three, especially the first two. The bartender, long brown hair/glasses - super friendly and attentive.   Service & food was awesome! Will definitely be returning and recommending RuRu's for Taco Tuesday to my friends!",

    "text": "Quick recap: this place had high praise and that gave me high hopes. While the food wasn't bad it wasn't great either. Worth checking out but keep expectations modest. Service isn't the best but the atmosphere is on point.   Been here three times. Not a fan of the limited margarita selection. And the fact that the bartender gave me a funny look when I asked if there was a house regular margarita.   Another time I went on a taco Tuesday (which only applies to buff chicken and ground beef tacos. Lame). Ordered a dos equis Amber with extra lime. Instead I got an old meck copper with no extra lime.   Tacos were not bad but nothing to brag about. Most taco stands on south Blvd have better tacos for much less $$. If I want to pay 4-5 dollars for a taco I go to Bakersfield.   I would recommend this place to see if you're a fan of trying something new.  You might get better service than I did and better food.",

Went with the \"I'll have what she's having \"(grilled mahi mahi), which was meh.. pretty bland. Also tried the chips and queso (yum) and the Pineapple Express (super good, loved that you actually got the hint of jalepeno). Prices were pretty decent.  Wish Yelp allowed for half points because I would give this place a 3.5 overall. Not a fan of the tacos, but I really enjoyed the ambiance and the friendly service. I'll definitely will be back when the weather is warmer to enjoy the patio.",

I was impressed with how big this place was, I feel like I have only seen pictures of the patio (which must be awesome when its warm). We sat at the bar, they had some good beer specials. True to form, we came for $2 tacos and ended up getting nachos and drinks which ended up being a $40 meal. Wouldn't get the nachos again. They were fine just not amazing. But speaking of amazing, the buffalo chicken tacos were sooo good! I even ordered another after I was already full. I think they must rotate what tacos are on special every week, because it was mahi and buffalo chicken this time. The mahi were good too, just not as good as the buffalo chicken. Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Came here for a birthday dinner on a Sunday night and it was still pretty busy! The patio was too full for our large party (about 10 people), so we sat inside. The doors to the patio were still open, though, so the space seemed open and inviting.  Our waiter was super nice and attentive and had great recommendations for those of us who hadn't been before. We started with the dip trio: guacamole, queso (blanco!), and salsa and all were very tasty. I had the You Talking to Me margarita which is made with jalapeno infused tequila and loved it. It had just enough kick at the end to keep you going back for more without overwhelming your palate.   When it was time to order, I decided on a tofu taco (Thats Not a Snowflake) and a fish taco (Its Probably Not Even a Crime These Days). The tofu taco was one of the best I've had- great textures and flavors. The tofu is fried in long blocks, so the outside is crispy but the inside definitely still has a \"tofu\" texture which played nicely with the beans and grilled veggies. The fish taco was also fried and had a wonderful sauce but to be honest it wasn't that memorable for me. Everyone else at my table loved their tacos as well, especially the Fat Guy In a Little Coat. Since it was a birthday dinner we got churros and sopapillas to share for dessert. Both were gone in about 2 seconds, but I would have to say the churro wins my vote for best dessert. Our server recommended the tres leches cake as his favorite but the least shareable so I have put it on my list to try next time.   Overall I would say this is a great place for upscale Mexican food/cocktails. The tacos are a bit expensive but on par with other similar restaurants in the area. I like that they have a lot of vegetarian options and the margarita selection is A+. I would love to come back for a leisurely dinner and some drinks on their beautiful patio this summer.",

    "text": "Ruru's caught my eye in the winter of 2015. Since I had been hibernating, I didn't make it out here until the yelp event in April. On an unseasonably warm day, Yelp hosted an event on the patio. The food was good and the drinks were strong. I couldn't wait to come back. It was an all around good time.  Our second visit to Ruru's happened a couple weekends ago. The weather was starting to turn to fall and we came in to celebrate. We sat on their beautiful patio and shared a couple plates. The patio was bustling with people, lots of groups, tvs were on, seemed like a great atmosphere. Like another reviewer said - the queso is good but runny. I would order it again. I ordered 3 tacos, but only 2 arrived and I was only charged for 2 - I tried one of the steak ones (gristly) and one of the carnitas (seemed cooked, chopped, and re-fried on a flat top). I got a side of guac which was watery for some reason - maybe because of the tomatoes in it? Not a fan. Fiance got both chicken tacos and the mahi taco. He seemed to like his more than I liked mine. We each ordered a cocktail and on Sundays they are half price which was a plus. Cocktails were good and strong - no watered down drinks here just because they were running a special. Our server was very nice but we had to ask him several times for napkins which should be a default table setting at a place where you eat with your hands. And whatever happened to my third taco?   Overall, I want to love Ruru's but I can't. The concept is cool and the patio is nice but the food could be better.",

The waiter was personable and the atmosphere was lively. Beautiful inside or on the large patio and outside. When we arrived we were told by the hostesses there was a 90 minute wait. The manager assured us it wouldn't be that long. We sat down within 15 minutes. That was the only negative - the hostesses should have a better grasp.

Like you couldn't hear yourself think, loud), and the service was... well, it was a little strange.  We were promptly seated (I called ahead about 30 minutes before and asked how much of a wait there would be and I got the answer \"you should be good\"), and then brought a...serving of chips and salsa? I knew these weren't complimentary here, so I told the guy that these weren't ours. Person #2 came up to our table shortly after and filled our water, and person #3 then came along and said that the chips were \"on them\" for the wait. What wait? Uh...what's going on? The chips were dense and suspiciously crispy, but I knew not to be impressed coming in. Salsa was good though!  We each got 3 tacos. We each loved one of them, and the other two were relatively plain. I enjoyed my crispy chicken and the lady enjoyed her tofu taco.   I want to come back to hang out on the patio, and I regret that I didn't try any drinks, but it was a cool experience to check out. I'm glad I did.",

The patio did not disappoint - it's fairly large so it can accommodate a lot of people and they had heat towers too, presumably for when it starts to cool down at night.  The food was pretty average though. I will rave about the queso - they give you so much and unlike most places it doesn't congeal after 15min. The tacos on the other hand weren't that great. The flavors were okay but the steak in one of mine was very dry and the mahi mahi taco was very lack-luster. Definitely not $4-5 tacos in my opinion. The drink list is extensive, I ended up getting the Buck Rogers and thought it was very good. All in all, I would probably go back and just do apps and drinks.  Lastly, the service was oddly slow. Granted I wasn't in a huge rush I was startled by how long it took to place our lunch order and get our checks at the end of the meal. If you know you want a drink and/or app order right away instead of waiting for your server to ask.",

First off, if the special is only on certain tacos, you'd think the waitress would tell us which ones. Nope. She didn't even tell us the drink specials (thankfully I looked them up in advance). Connie overlooked my fiance and I, and seemed distracted even though this place was ANYTHING but busy.   I ordered Fat Guy in a Little Coat, Uncle Buck and I'll Have What She's Having tacos. The Fat Guy Taco's steak was well cooked, but lacked citrus. The Crispy chicken taco had dry chicken, and also lacked flavor. Uncle Buck had the most flavor out of the 3, but also seemed to lack some citrus/flavor.  My fiance then asked our waitress (when she finally reappeared) for a few lemon wedges. 10 min later, she comes back with my fiancee beer and our lemon wedges. Weird.  So the beer was great- we ordered Legion Juicy J- but our tacos were overpriced ($4 when we thought $2) and lacked in flavor. Probably THE most disappointing Tacos we've ever had. $50? Not worth it.  You're better off going to Bakersfield East Blvd. (life changing Tacos) or spending a little more $$ and eat at Cabo Fish Taco.  Might come back here for drinks (though we've heard those are also overpriced and stingy) but this experience was extremely disappointing.  Maybe we caught Connie on a bad day but, save yourself the wasted time/money!",

We drove up from Columbia specifically to eat here and were not disappointed.  We parked off providence and were a tad but confused on how to get in to the restaurant. Once we found our way, we decided to sit outside... it was super busy on a Saturday and only one table was open (and clean) so we sat in the BLARING HOT sun... as soon as another table with an umbrella was cleared we moved!!! Only downside - there was a wasp burrowing in the wooden bench were we sitting on (paranoia for me)!  We ordered the trio app (loved every single bit of it) and 6 tacos (see pics). I was a fan of the uncle buck - I'd never had an oyster taco before and RuRu's did it right! My bf enjoyed all of his choices - I also ordered the fish and tofu tacos and neither were life changing for me. My son got a plain cheese quesadilla and enjoyed it as well.  We returned a few months later to get to-go (I only ordered the uncle buck) - I tried to order an authentic Mexican soda (I saw them on their menu via yelp), but the bartender said they only carried Mexican coke. Boo! We also parked in the back this time and entered through the patio.  Overall good experience both times - I'd recommend this joint if you like trying creative tacos!!",

It's all set in a gorgeous 1920's villa, and it visually does not disappoint.  The music was slightly a buzz kill (Shaggy, Blink 182 , Smash Mouth, and other 90's songs..) but I'm hoping they'll work out the kink on that one.  The staff was very welcoming and friendly, happy to suggest items from the menu.  The items on the menu are all named from lines from movies, which is really fun!  Food was great - Wonderful chili queso, tacos are priced between $3-$4, sides additional, and I thought $9 for a small bowl of chili was a little steep.  They offer a very eclectic cocktail menu and frozen margaritas which is also a nice addition.  Overall, great place!  I knocked off a star for the music and pricing, and the fact that chips and salsa weren't free..  Other than that, a must try.",

    "text": "In my opinion, Charlotte lacks food venues that are well thought out and as much visually interesting as tasty.  I feel like if a restaurant is well thought out and atmospherically pleasing, the food is lacking. Ruru's has both. The atmosphere is a very cool villa that has been transformed for dining and the details down to the square hollowed out ice cubes are way cool! I had the queso, salsa, and guacamole. All a very nice way to start the meal (although everything here is a la carte so do not expect the salsa and chips off the bat) I also tasted the tofu rice bowl which was very fresh tasting. I ordered the skirt steak taco and the mahi taco. Simple and delicious. Great drink selection and clever menu... Before I go on, I must say overall we were pleased with our experience. When We arrived it was Sunday around 6:15 and we sat at the bar as it was completely empty. The bartender seemed a bit agitated and aloof that we were even there. This somewhat bothered me because I was so hungry. After several minutes, he told us he wanted to get our order because he needed to get over to a 6 person table behind us- clearly going to be a bigger tip so clearly higher priority. We got our appetizer Ina very timely manner but we decided to talk to the other bartender for the duration because of what happened next. The original bartender, a tall middle aged bald man, got pissed that the lady at the table behind us had left him a $2 tip. It wasn't enough that he told us... He had to show us the receipt, bitch to the other bartender, and the servers standing at the well. \"I've never received a worse tip\" was something he said and also called the woman a choice name. He did not know us or know that I have been a bartender for over a decade. These things happen. Thales are \"tips\" not mandatory. Also, I understand having a bad night, but I do not agree with discussing a bad tip with anyone let alone customers that you do not know! We would have stayed for many more tasty drinks but we decided to leave because of the absurdity of this situation. Also, I took my normal 30% tip to just over 18%... Which was out of courtesy for the other kind bartender.",

    "text": "I want to preface this review with stating that I'm in the service industry so I like to think that I'm understanding to some of the little weird quirks of certain servers and bartenders. RuRu's has pretty decent food and amazing cocktails, so it stinks that my rating couldn't be higher, but the little blonde bartender tonight was something else. First of all we came in at 10pm, and the posted closing time is 11pm, and received huffs and puffs and eye rolls all the way to the kitchen where she  checked if we could still order food. Every item I tried to order on the menu that was smacked down in front of me, she then told me was the wrong choice and poked fun at. I asked for a to-go cup for my Diet Coke and then she charged me for 2 drinks, which is plain stupid. Lastly a friend and I just simply wanted to split our $15 dip appetizer and were told that it would be too hard for her to split the item. You're using MICROS, the same computer system 90% of the Charlotte dining scene uses, it is VERY possible and VERY easy to do. Moral of the story, homegirl just wanted to boost the price of our bill to receive a larger tip. I get it. It was a slow night. Little did she know that I make a living off bartending and tip minimum 40% short of the server cussing me out. In this case I actually left MORE than that, but I just want management to know (if you're reading this) that your food is only as good as the hands serving it!!",

And booth area was more quiet than the bar area which was very noisy. Awesome restrooms, great decor  good service. Great parking.  Should be a big hit. Is a little expensive compared to some simple Mexican places,  they also charged $5 for a salsa refill. Which is free at most Mex places.",

We were seated at a dirty table, and we had to ask 3 different people to clean it, 2 of which seemed annoyed that we were asking them to do so. When our food came, our order was incorrect (I ordered 3 tacos, how does that get messed up). And, just as previous reviews said, the food was terrible. The steak was bland. No seasoning. The chicken was practically burned. I get \"blackened\" but this was way too charred, and again, bland. Easily one of the worst meals I've had in Charlotte. Just bad. I will never go back",

I HATE it when we get sat at a two person table in a row of two person tables that are all full even though there are other tables unoccupied all over the patio. It just makes for awkward conversation because all the other tables are right next to you. Honestly not a fan of the crazy entree names, every table around us just ordered what they actually were, but I get the quirky thing they're trying to do I guess. We got the tres amigos, the salsa is good, the queso could have been better if it was actually warm? Got a couple friend zone margs and I'd have to say that after consuming 3-4 each neither of us felt remotely intoxicated...I wonder if they're a little diluted because of the Monday deal? The chicken fajitas were nothing to write home about, super greasy. The fish tacos...the problem with using flour tortillas is that you can't skimp on your fillings otherwise they look extra sparse since the tortilla is larger, which is exactly what happened here, tiny pieces of fried mahi mahi covered in way too much aoli. Our server was great though so that definitely bumped me up stars wise. Like everyone else has said, come have some drinks and queso on the patio and not much more else.",

    "text": "Yesterday was our second visit back to this establishment and although their tacos are pretty good, their service is absolutely abysmal. First it was our drink order. I ordered a water and a sangria and my girlfriend ordered a Diet Coke along with a water. Fifteen minutes roll by and our waiter comes back with just my sangria. He then disappears for another 10 minutes. He returns with her Diet Coke so we decide to go ahead and order an appetizer along with our dinner order. Fast forward another 15 minutes and the chips and queso we ordered as our app never even show up and at this point I was so mad I didn't even want to mention it to our waiter. Nor did I even mention the beer that I ordered that never came. Finally our tacos arrive and the four that I ordered and the two that she ordered were not even plated properly. Hers were mixed with mine and mine with hers. Looking through all the reviews for this place and the root of the problem seems to be the service, which is a real bummer since their food is pretty unique and good. If service continues to be a problem all the time then I'm assuming that comes from piss poor management. It will be a while before I consider coming back.",

We ordered chips and queso, which was just OK. The chips were great, but the queso was luke warm at best. I also ordered the organic rice bowl, which wasn't bad, but similar to one at Chipotle ($2 less). Overall, this is a great place to hang out and have a drink with decent food.",

No straws available. #sensitiveteeth  Taco Tuesday is a joke-only two options are $2 (some oyster crap and a pork belly but without the cilantro and slaw that's on their regular menu)  I ordered two chicken tacos and they were doused in a mayo based sauce and some damp and warm lettuce.  Promptly sending those back, I ordered a quesadilla.  It was a heavy, soup, saucy meaty mess I was thankful my husband ate most of it.  I would give this place no stars except for the fact that our server was great.  This was just definitely not the place for us and that's okay.",

    "text": "RuRu's was nothing exceptionally spectacular but nothing gut wrenchingly awful either. I will start with the positives: it is adorable, it has a nice feel inside the restaurant, a nice patio with its own bar, and plenty of seating available. Another plus... \"There's no crying in baseball\" is what one of the appetizers is named. Now, I know all of the items have movie related names but this is CLASSIC. (From one of my top 5 movies!) :)  Heads up for the chips and salsa lovers, they are not complimentary here you must purchase them. The chips were not our favorite because they did not taste fresh, but the salsa was extremely tasty--good ratio of chunky to juicy with a good spice to it.  My boyfriend ordered three tacos that afternoon (That's not a snowflake, Fat guy in a little coat, I'll have what she's having). It was nice that there was a small selection of $2 tacos for Taco Tuesday.   Tacos were plated nicely, they are of moderate size, a la carte for the tacos. He was full eating two of them after chips and salsa. I am a vegan so I had to be a little tricky in order to eat something here. Vegetarians have a few options with ease. The waiter, who was actually the bartender, was very patient and correctly took my order. I got the \"You got no legs Lt. Dan\" (another good movie quote, by the way) with no cheese or creme, add avocado. They were very kind to take this order with ease and it came out correct as well. My only complaint about the dish was that several times throughout eating, I would get a bite of hardened rice that literally snapped/crunched. I understand food prep, but maybe being a little more mindful on keeping the food fresh would be beneficial.   We had a margarita each, pretty classic taste, no complaints there. We did appreciate how hard the bartender was working to assist in waiting tables during the in-between lunch and dinner hours. He was also having to stock and mind to (both) the bars. He did a great job and was friendly.   It is a restaurant close to home and they do have tofu options, so it is filed away in our places to give another try in the future.",

    "text": "I have become Mexican Food obsessed over night it seems like and I am all about Tacos and Tequila lately lol So RuRus has been on my \"To Eat\" list for a while!!   On my way to Southpark Mall a friend of mine and I stop at RuRus for a late lunch and I could barely walk out because I was full and a little intoxicated ( don't judge me)!  We were very confused and lost at first because we parked in the parking lot of off Providence Rd and could not find a RuRus door with a sign. Walk around people, learn from our mistakes lol.  When we finally found the front door (back door????) we were immediately seated and we started with drinks off the bat! I ordered the Frank the Tank with raspberry and my friend ordered the Say Hello to my Little Friend. WARNING: Frank the Tank is no joke, I asked for more raspberry and still could barely drink it lol if I was going out for the night I would appreciate that drink being so strong! BUT I was going shopping afterwards and I knew it would be a struggle to shop after that drink. Over all the drink is worth the money lol  For appetizers we ordered the Billy Ray Valentine. The queso was really good but a little too runny for my liking. Now for my entree if I could order every taco and sample them I would've but I chose 2 tacos and my friend ordered 2. For me I had \"I'll Have What She's Having\" and \"It was the Dukes\" I think I made 2 great choices! I loved the grilled Mahi Mahi! My friend had the \"Fat Guy in a Little Coat\" and the \"Its Probably Not Even a Crime These Days\". She is an extremely picky eater and all of her tacos.   After writing this review I'm ready for a taco! See you at RuRu's!",

The villa is beautiful and so is the Mexican food! The food is SO fresh. Not to mention they boast 100 flavors of tequila, so drinks are a must.  Their tacos are fantastic! They've got a nice selection on their menu, where you order them individually. The mahi taco is one of my favorites here -- it is really fresh and refreshingly zesty! I can tell that they pride themselves in using good, fresh ingredients.  There's no way you can come here without getting the guac or cheese dip appetizer. The guac is delicious and full of flavor. The chips are also really good -- not too thick and not too thin.  I also recommend the Fajitas! The steak fajita is made with quality steak and topped with a cilantro sauce, which gives it a little bit of a bite and makes it unique compared to other fajitas I have had.",

Every course of our food took a VERY LONG time. So long we had to search for him to get... water refills, more drinks and our food. I can't even think about recommending this place. Oh yeah the food wasn't anything that could make up for the terrible service.",

While waiting for a patio table on a perfect-weather day, my friends and I ordered margaritas at the outdoor bar. After pouring our drinks, the bartender set the drinks on the bar, didn't say a word to us, and then disappeared for 10-15 minutes. We were left confused and waiting for a drink tab that never came because the bartender had completely left the patio with no acknowledgment to us. He managed to conveniently reappear only to reprimand us for standing just outside of the bar (despite there being no room on the patio) and continued to reprimand us as we willingly, politely and immediately relocated to the indoor bar. At this point, he still had not presented us a tab and our table was now ready. Not wanting to deal with this ridiculously rude bartender anymore, we took our table and expected perhaps our drink tab would appear at our table. Our waiter was outstanding and a refreshing experience compared to the unprofessional bartender we'd been dealing with all night. However, our waiter had to be the one to tell us that the bar staff had instructed him to get us to pay our bar tab before he could serve us food. Kinda hard to pay a bar tab when you're never presented with one! Again, the food and margaritas were phenomenal, and even our waiter was great! But the bartender we interacted with was an utter embarrassment and should perhaps be trained on the common process of a patron ordering a drink, being served that drink, PRESENTING THAT PATRON WITH A TAB, and then the patron paying for it.",

As for the food, there are better tacos around town. My mahi taco was dry and lacked seasoning. The Korean beef taco was ok, but again dry and needed a little something more. The buffalo chicken taco was my favorite. For the quality and service, I won't be back.",

I choose to eat it because I didn't want to wait to have the order redone, but the food was subpar. Not to mention he also got my drink order wrong. The manager came over to apologize about the food and ended up just insulting us instead by stating we were used to fake cheese.

While a bit tough to find from the Providence Road entrance, a subtle entry opens way to an impressively laid out restaurant.  The spacious bar and seating promotes a good atmosphere within the confines of the building but, untested is the elaborate outside bar setup which looks to be a must-go for warmer weather drinks.  The drinks were, simply, fantastic.  The food, however, was fantastically simple.  I'll lend some leniency given it's time on the scene, and give them credit for managing easy-to-miss operational issues like service quality and time.  As other reviews note, no freebees here, but the chips trio was great with very generously portioned guac/salsa/queso.  Calling it like it is, the food needs works.  The taste is short and I think the restaurant knows it as they appear to try to compensate with over serving taco-sauces (aioli, ranch-blah, etc.).    Quite frankly, I'll be back b/c I loved the bar, loved the atmosphere and the food wasn't inedible, it just wasn't that good.  So I'll manage expectations accordingly.  I'm hoping that I can review the review upward in time to come.",

Two of us had fajitas.   We loved it all!  We had guacamole as an appetizer. The serving was small, that was definitely a negative. Also our waitress although very sweet was not knowledgable when we asked questions.   Great tequila selection! They had all of our favorites.   They don't take reservations. We went at 8:30 and waited about 20 minutes at the bar.   We hope to go back soon.",

It is so unlike anywhere else that I have ever been in Charlotte. The service can be a little slow at times, but I actually prefer that over pushy waiters/waitresses. Both the guacamole and queso are delicious here- even the salsa is extra good!  I have tried every salad that they offer and they are all delicious and unique. I did not enjoy the burrito bowls as much- I would definitely not order one again. The tacos are also excellent, but very small. RuRu's also has great drinks- I LOVE that they serve frozen margaritas. Ask for the Mango, I promise you won't regret it!!   If you can't decide about whether or not to try RuRu's, I would definitely say give it a chance. I had very positive experiences here and can't wait for more long dinners on the patio during the summer!",

Our waitress was forced to cash us out and lost her section until we paid and left our table. We were not drunk, we were polite to everyone, and we were paying for our service. Unfortunately we are people of different shades of brown and it appears we were being pushed out for this reason only. There were several tables clear, and other occupied tables were sitting there and only drinking.  #Donaldtrumpcountry. Don't give them your money.",

The meat was perfect - slight char on the outside and medium rare on the inside.  The only note of distaste was the 23% service charge automatically added to the bill. The waitress commented that 20% was for her, which I have no problem with, and 3% was for the person who took the reservation. Since when does an employee deserve $18 for taking a 1 minute phone call for a reservation. That my friends is a ripoff.",

    "text": "I walked out of Ru Ru's the first time thinking the place had great potential. They definitely need to work on their service - it's slow and having all the staff linger around the bar, chit chat and eat there seemed a little weird/unprofessional? But whatever, place seems cool - I'd come back here with friends! The ambiance is beautiful and I was already envisioning spending many warm afternoons and evening on their patio enjoying a margarita or two. I came back a week later with some friends and this time we walked out just after a round of drinks and apps because the food was unimpressive and some aspects of the service were pretty bad too. My first time there we tried all the tacos and while the two chicken ones (fried & grilled) were really good, the others were mediocre. My second visit there we had the chips and guac, wings and calamari. The calamari was good, the guac was ok, but the wings were very gamey. What really drove us out though were the drinks. Aside from taking forever to get to us, they weren't even good. We also had a live bartending lesson going on behind our table at the bar, because of which they turned off the music. Really?  we had to request it be turned back on (which they did eventually) because the place was really quiet and we could hear the step by step instructions on how our drinks were being prepared. Nothing wrong with that, but it was killing the vibe a bit. It's a great location, great set-up, perhaps it's still a diamond in the rough and needs a little more time?",

On making a reservation: No Open Table. You need to call.  On the atmosphere: Maybe it was because of the holidays, maybe because it's a new hot spot in Myers Park - the place was packed. Good thing I made a reservation. The patio is going to be fabulous in the spring...and maybe even give Selwyn a run for it's money.  On the drinks: Three of my friends got margaritas, and they all said the margs were on the sweet side. I really enjoy the smokiness of mezcal, so I opted for the \"I Love the Smell of Napalm\". The drink was perfectly balanced - the rosemary syrup did not overpower.  On the food: Very funny dish names. We started out with \"Three Amigos\". The quest blanco was parked in front of me and I could not stop. I ordered \"Fat Guy in a Little Coat\" and \"Long Duk Dong\" with a side of the white beans. Both tacos were delicious. Beans were ho hum. Next time, I'd skip the white beans and get another taco - probably \"Uncle Buck\".",

Not free, not $1, but $5!  Then their house margarita is $9.50. The tacos don't come with sides, no rice, no beans, nothing. You have to pay for sides. So without even getting into the flavor of the food, it's pretty clear they are nickle and diming the customers.   That being said, I have no problem paying (or even overpaying) for good food. Unfortunately the food wasn't great. The carne asada tacos didn't have much flavor, neither did the pork carnitas tacos. Didn't even seem like they seasoned or marinated them.  Really underwhelming. The crispy chicken taco was solid. The $9.50 house margarita was average. And the $5 chips and salsa were good, but not worth the money.  On the plus side, the patio is fantastic.   Overall there are better, and certainly much more affordable, options for Mexican food in Meyers Park and the surrounding areas.",

I've only been here on the weekend, but I love the ambiance - it's a young, fun and hip crowd perfect for a group dinner before heading out. I bring my friends from out of town here all the time and no one has ever left disappointed! The wait is always fairly long, but the outdoor bar and waiting area are fantastic when the weather is nice and I've never had a problem getting a drink at the indoor or outdoor bar while I wait. I highly recommend the jalapeno margarita!   I also love the tacos - I've tried a bunch of them at this point, but my favorites are the Stage 5 Clinger and the Fat Guy in a Little Coat (also love the names!). The tacos are large with a lot of toppings and meat, so two tacos is more than enough to fill me up after some chips and guac/queso to start. The thing that I really love about RuRu's is that you order tacos individually, so you can mix and match as you please. The cost is also great - I can get two margaritas, two tacos and split an appetizer with my friends and leave with a bill under $30 (excluding tip).   Overall, this is a great spot for a fun night out and really great food for the cost - worth the wait!",

The patio is easily one of the best in Myers Par with it's tree covered canopy, outdoor bar, firepits and yard lights.  This is easily a place you could spend a few hours having drinks and enjoying the weather.   Monday-Wednesday have drink specials so I had some strawberry and mint margarita.  It was delicious, just strong enough and only $5!!!  What????  The queso and chips were on point and so were the tacos.  Sure, some won't like that the names of the tacos are taken from movie quotes but who cares.  The Stage 5 Clinger, Looking Good Louis, I'll Have What She's Having, and the Long Duk Dong were incredible. I recommend getting a bunch and sharing as we did.      Best of all, it wasn't a budget buster.  I've been places, paid a lot more and regretted my meal. This is one I definitely plan to frequent this summer, especially out on the patio.",

Very hit or miss. A couple of times it's been just plain bad but that's pretty rare.  Drinks are pretty tasty. They have good margarita options. But better ask for a double because they're weak.  Service has taken forever every single time we have gone (10 mins to get your drink order in, another 10-15 to actually get the drinks/ order your food, another 25-30 to get your food. And good luck finding your waiter if you want another drink).  The redeeming quality is the ambiance. Awesome outdoor area with a bar and regular tables. Inside is also very inviting.  So if you just want a nice place to sit for a (long) while and drink and eat decent food, try it out. If your looking for really good Mexican food, skip it.",

Parking is a bit of a pain but that's pretty much Charlotte in general. I will say the patio is very cool and would be a great happy hour spot. But let's get to the food. First of all any Tex-Mex, Mexican restaurant should always have chips and salsa for a table, which RuRu's does not. To me this is a huge no no. Also I think any dish should come with rice and beans. But the Tacos are all al a cart but if you order at least two they give you a small side with them. I order black beans and to say small side is putting it lightly. It was literally about a two bite portion. Now don't get me wrong I'm cool with the al a cart taco option but they should also have a taco plate option that comes with rice and beans. Now to the actual Tacos, I ordered a Long Duck Dong(Korean style steak) and a Fat Guy In a Little Coat(steak taco), while I loved the play on movie lines for taco names I can't say the same for the actual tacos. I thought they were pretty bland and left a lot to be desired.   I really had high hopes but was quite disappointed. I would possible recommended going and hanging on the patio for drinks and maybe an app but as for the Tacos I'd pass.",

Usually other taco places lack in flavor or in tenderness when you add steak, but this skirt steak was seasoned (juicy) and cooked to perfection. I will be recommending this and making this my new lunch spot",

The weather is gorgeous and there's not a single person at your inside bar so you should have your outside bar staffed!  You had a patio full of diners but no one waited on me at the bar.  I politely stop a server and say \"can you have the bartender take my order?\" Oh sure and just like last time I was neglected, again today she explains the bartender must run between outdoor and indoor bars.  Yeah ok but there's not a single person at indoor bar!!! You have 4 patrons outside - it's a beautiful Carolina day!  I wait for 10 more minutes and say screw it, I'm hungry I'll eat at indoor bar.  As I walk in bartender goes I was coming out.  Nevermind I'll eat inside.  Then he's got a chip on his shoulder the whole time.  I was polite and left a decent tip but you need your hostess and her boyfriend/ coworker to get their heads out of their butts and notice who needs service on the patio instead of cooing over one another, reading texts, and discussing their college courses.  They are oblivious!!!",

Now I will say this place is extremely popular so I did expect it to be pretty good.  Also, their outdoor setting is really pretty.  Service was very slow so don't expect to get your food in a decent amount of time. For an appetizer we got the three amigos. The salsa, guacamole, and queso, they were okay, nothing special.  Moving on to the food.  I got the chicken burrito and it was extremely disappointing.  If you've ever tried the lime Tostito chips with the fake overwhelming lime flavor, that is exactly what my burrito tasted like but more limey and more fake.  I think it was the rice and the beans that was soaked in fake lime.  Also, I was charged $36 for a margarita pitcher.  Even at the most expensive Tex-mex and Mexican restaurants (including in New York) I have never seen margarita pitchers priced so ridiculously.  Oh and the pitcher was probably the size of a large drink at McDonald's filled with tons and tons of ice.  It may be a good place to hang out, but I definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",

We chose to sit inside with no wait, but since the doors were open on this beautiful evening, we got the best of both worlds.  Thursday was half-off tequila drinks, so I had a classic margarita, which was perfectly blended. The six of us enjoyed each other's company, shared a Three amigos app of salsa, queso, and guac, and ordered some specialty tacos for dinner.  After about 30 minutes, our food finally came out. I was disappointed to know my tacos were a little cold. They tasted good, but I wished they were a little more fresh. My margarita was the best part about my meal, but our server did not come about asking about another round until after our food was served. I will return soon to give it another shot because I love the location and the ambiance.",

The outdoor space was very nice and looks like it would be awesome during warm weather. I started with the \"I Am Mclovin'\" (cheese dip) and the \"You Talkin to Me\", jalapeno margarita. Both were very delicious. For the main course I went with the jasmine rice bowl, \"You Got no Legs Lt. Dan\". The names of the dishes were super funky and I loved it. The rice bowl was larger than I imagined but was very tasty. My friends had the tacos and have great reviews. It was my first time at RuRu's but looking forward to dining with them again!",

I had the death by RuRu the first time, I found it to be lacking in flavor and overpowered by the beans. Visit 2 I had three tacos (the dukes, the get off my lawn, and the slappin the bass) with a margarita and everything was absolutely fantastic! It made me realize why my friends like to go to this restaurant, I mean it was so good! Then, we went last night and I had three tacos with a margarita again (get off my lawn, slappin the bass, you're going the wrong way) and honestly it was not great, or even good. The margarita was just a glass of sour water, the tacos with fried items were 90% batter with very little inside, and the chicken was really dry. On the other hand, my boyfriend had the Clarence Beeks with a beer and thought it was amazing (i had a bite too- it WAS amazing). So needless to say, I would really appreciate more consistency. I totally understand that things get busy and it's so fair that things slip through the cracks at those times but it would be really nice if just a little more attention was paid.",

I came here during lunch with a group of coworkers. Service was okay, but not above and beyond. At one point my iced tea cup sat empty for a while.  There is a deal where you buy 2 tacos and get one free so I ordered three tacos. I got the \"Fat guy in a little coat\" which was a steak taco, \"It was the Dukes\" which was a pork belly carnitas and \"Get Off my lawn\" which was a stuffed pepper with shrimp and cheese. I wasn't really amazed by any of them. The steak seemed to lack flavor, but the avocado aioli was great. The pork belly was dry and there was not enough flavor for me. The only one that I enjoyed was the stuffed jalapeno pepper with shrimp. The slaw was flavorful. And the stuffed jalapeno part was good and cheesy. It was fried and I kind of regretted it later in the sense of this is so good It's bad for me. Great atmosphere, but for me the food and service were just okay.",

I have no idea why this table is even an option. It directly in front of an open kitchen. It is the worst. High traffic area with lots of clutter not to mention having to heat the kitchen noise. That table shouldn't even be there! My friends had already ordered the trio of guacamole, queso and pico. It was good and flavorful.  Our server was very knowledgeable about he menu and drink options. We inquired about what tacos are for taco Tuesday, try only offer two. A tilapia and a buffalo chicken. Disappointed by the option, however i decided on a buffalo and their fat guy in a little coat taco. Happy i didn't order the fish taco, it looked basic with one friendly getting a decent amount and one getting barely any. The buffalo chicken was good, but very basic. A place this known for tacos could of added some flare to these. The fat guy in A little coat taco could of been great but the aioli ruined it for me. I love aioli, this one came with an avacado aioli, but this one tasted like straight up mayo on my steak taco. The food coming out the kitchen (since we had a front row seat) was looking good and I May give this place another try but for taco Tuesday lovers, this is not the place.",

They are friendly and helpful.  The restaurant is large, so plenty of seating and good for groups.  The bar is good-sized as well.  The patio is the hip place to be in this area of Charlotte and it's a very nice patio with a separate bar.  The bar outside is covered, but the seating is not.    Parking here is interesting.  The front lot gets filled up quickly as it is super small and large SUV's like to take up all the spots.  The parking behind the building is much easier to get in and out of but harder to find if you don't know where to look.    Overall a decent place for drinks and some chips and queso blanco.",

Which is a good thing  You won't leave hungry. The toppings complimented the seafood perfectly. We also ordered the \"This is Sparta\" nachos. It was a very large portion...could have had a few more jalapenos, but still delicious. The cheese is very good. My friends & hubby got the fajitas & said the rice was very bland but the guacamole was good. Our waitress was very friendly also.",

I am a vegetarian and finding restaurants with explicitly stated options is always difficult; but at Ruru's I had a favorite dish that was the perfect option. However, during our most recent visit, my usual order came with an unexpected surprise- a large piece of chicken. I recognized the texture right away and after examining it on my plate and having my family do a taste test it was confirmed. I got very upset but was understanding of the mistake. After mentioning the issue to our waitress she said that she would tell her manager and that he would come apologize personally. He never came, and she never said why. Restaurants that advertise vegetarian options need to take the appropriate measures ensure they are keeping their promise.",

As far as Charlotte I think Pacos Tacos sets the bar and RuRu does not meet up to the great flavors at Pacos. My wife taught her tacos were good and would defiantly be back. It was a little pricy for 4 tacos, burrito, two beers and a app for $60. For me it was ok however good atmosphere so I would recommend giving it a try.",

First time I've been to this part of \"The Villa\" since it was Uncle Milt's, and I have to say I think it's a shame no other restaurants have tried to make it work here since then (at least none that I can remember) as the space is awesome.  Easily the best ambiance of any of the \"taco & tequila\" places that seem to be everywhere in Charlotte lately.  Food & drink?  I started with their take on the Moscow Mule.  It had a rosemary syrup and sprig in it and was... okay.   Also payed for the free-in-most-places-like-this Chips & Salsa.  Worth the charge?  Not so much - chips were average at best, and the salsa tasted like it came from a jar.  Bummer, as that's usually my barometer for a place like this.  Oh well, on to the next course.  Had the Korean skirt steak taco, the Fried Oyster taco and a side of spicy slaw.  KB taco was pretty tasty.  Oyster taco had too much wasabi crema on it, but was otherwise okay.  Slaw was average.  My wife had the grilled Mahi taco and a side of organic jasmine brown rice.  She remarked that the taco hardly had any fish in it, and her side of rice \"angered\" her it was so bad.  She ate my slaw.  Kid had a Mexican soda and the cheese quesadilla (recco'd for kids).  We took a bite, and thought it was basic but serviceable.  Service?  Waiter was quite overwhelmed by the busy-ness of the evening - I asked to hear the RuRu's story, but he cut me off.  Barely saw him again until it was time to pay.  Fortunately he wasn't the one responsible for the delivery of the food or drinks - everything came on time.  Chips were even refreshed without asking.    If only I had liked them enough to want more...",

As everyone has mentioned the location and ambiance are great - but that's kinda canceled out when you don't get to eat. We ordered margaritas and the tres amigos appetizer. It took awhile to get drinks, but nothing too outrageous. They were alright, but nothing to really write home about. The tres amigos app was definitely the highlight of the night, everything tasted super fresh and had great flavor. Our waiter came over and took our order while we had our appetizer and we both asked for recommendations and ordered a few tacos. Then 30 minutes passed. Then an hour passed. Then without being asked how we were or if we were ready we were brought the check..... we were confused and asked if we weren't getting tacos and our waiter told us he thought we had already ate. He thought we had eaten without bringing anything, taking away anything, or seeing if we liked anything.. He then offered to get the tacos made and comp the tacos for our wait but at this point we had been in the restaurant for almost two hours and my friend needed to leave. We paid for our drinks and appetizer and went on our way. With so many other great options (and far better service) in the area I don't know how this place competes, don't think we'll be back.",

You'll see the big patio and also a parking lot there.   So, let's start with that big 'ole patio. I cannot wait until it warms up outside. It looks like a great place to hang out and to have drinks.  This is not one of those restaurants where you sit down and a server automatically brings you chips and salsa. If you want them, you have to order and pay for them. Instead of salsa, I order the Billy Ray Valentine. It's like cheese dip on steroids.... a queso with chorizo, corn relish and pico. I usually get two tacos and a side of the creamy white beans. Tacos range from $3.50-$4 and you can add a side for $2. So if you go the taco route, you'll spend about $10 for your meal. So far I've had: \"I'll Have What She's Having\" (grilled mahi-mahi), \"Uncle Buck\" (fried oysters) and \"Fat Guy In A Little Coat\" (grilled skirt steak). I've liked them all so far.   I haven't had anything from the cocktail list yet. I'm excited to try their version of a spicy margarita. Last night, they had $5 white sangria on special. I'm not the biggest sangria person, but hey when in Rome right? Or should I say Mexico?  The staff have all been nice. Service has been a little hit or miss. I think they're still feeling things out since they are fairly new.",

    "text": "I loves me some tacos, and a girlfriend and I decided to try out RuRu's after work one Tuesday. She was smart and parked in the back; I followed my GPS and parked in the front, which made it a little tricky to find since it's not well-marked at all from that side. If you're looking at Stagioni on the left, go to the door on the right. We got there around 4:30, and we were the first ones there, so we grabbed a seat at the bar. Unfortunately it was way too hot to sit on the patio, but it looked pretty awesome out there.  We grabbed some drinks ($5 draft for her - Tuesday special, $9 sangria for me) and started with the I Am McLovin' queso and chips. For dinner, I got a It Was the Dukes taco and a Long Duck Dong taco. All the food and my sangria were fine, but nothing was outstanding. However, the ambiance and service were stellar. It was odd to be at a fun, Mexican restaurant with movie names on the menu when the restaurant is so pretty, but we went with it!  I'd definitely come back, but I'm more likely to do it on a nice-weather Wednesday when I can sit on the patio, skip the food, and have a refreshing adult beverage.",

So if you don't like or are allergic to cilantro I do not suggest this restaurant.  The wine slushy was interesting.  They have a daily drink special. Our server was great.  I wish the chefs would have some protein options without cilantro. There is only 1 that is not seafood or tofu.",

    "text": "At least we can all agree that the patio is exceptional.  I wanted to love it here -- I'm always on the lookout for bomb tacos -- but I was underwhelmed by my visit to RuRu's.  Eight of us ladies planned to have lunch at RuRu's for a going away celebration. One of my coworkers wanted to give them a heads up that we would have a group, but she was quickly rebuked with \"we don't accept reservations.\" That's fine, but a \"thanks for letting us know, we'll be ready for you\" would have been pleasant. Not a great first impression.  One of our ladies arrived first and ordered appetizers and waters for everyone. Our server came by, declined to introduce himself, and asked if anyone wanted anything else to drink. I asked, \"do you have any housemade sodas?\" The look he gave me answered my question; a glazed 'does-not-compute' face. Right on. Water's fine.  Menus were on the table. I see that other reviewers generally appreciate the movie references in the dish names, but I have to disagree, even though I'm a big fan of movies. I just feel like such a tool ordering the \"Glass Case of Emotion, One Time at Band Camp, and two Fat Guy in a Little Coat tacos, please.\"   It's True, chips are not complementary. I've heard here on Yelp that if you order them, your server will keep refilling your chips, but I didn't see that to be True in our case. Salsa, queso, and guac will run you $5, $7, and $8.50, respectively.  Tacos come on flour tortillas by default, but I was happy to see that they can be served on corn tortillas for gluten free diners like me.  Our orders came out quickly and correctly, with most of us ordering three tacos apiece. No one told us which tacos were which, but it's probably for the best, as the names mean nothing. I started with the Lookin' Good Louis (a shrimp taco -- just call it a shrimp taco). It was head and shoulders above my other two choices, the It Was the Dukes (pork belly) taco and I'll Have What She's Having (mahi) taco. My latter tacos were sorely lacking in seasoning. I was especially disappointed by the pork belly; it had all the signature fat of the cut but without any sear or sauce. Just greasy, shredded pork.  Our check situation was a little confusing, with one person picking up all the appetizers and another paying for three people, but cards and receipts were charged and returned smoothly.  Languid service, bland proteins, and a lame menu leave me with two stars. My search for decent tacos in the Queen City continues.",

The crispy chicken taco is also very tasty and reminds me of bang bang shrimp with the chipotle sauce. And the bad: the steak taco was very chewy, I ended up having to take half the steak off the taco because it was too tough to eat. The pork carnitas taco was extremely sweet and dry. I ended up sending this back to be replaced with the crispy chicken taco. The mahi mahi was VERY fishy tasting. Not sure if it was old or what but took one bite and sent it back.   The staff was very friendly and apologetic for the issues with the food and the were more than happy to replace the tacos we didn't like with another. Not sure if I visited on an off day or what but it seems like their menu has some kinks to work out.",

Great ratio of liquor to juice. We got the queso to start which did not have an awful artificial taste that often accompanies queso. Perfect way to start the meal. Then we got two burritos the death by ruru and the steak burrito. Death by ruru was very spicy but both burritos were huge and delicious. Prices were very reasonable. Definitely walked away full and happy. Did not try tacos but will def be back.   TL;DR - lots of great food at an affordable price, come hungry",

But whether you dine inside or out, you'll enjoy some outstanding Tex-Mex dishes, solid margaritas, and friendly service.   On a recent Friday evening, we grabbed an outdoor table, ordered a couple of drinks, and settled in for a terrific meal. The chips and salsa we started with were crunchy and delicious, though a bit pricey. The margaritas were tasty, but small -- and could've used just a bit more tequila.  The taco selection is extensive, with names that will make cinemaphiles smile: 'Stage Five Clinger,' 'I'll Have What She's Having,' and 'Those Aren't Pillows'. I ordered the Korean-style 'Long Duck Dong,' which was just OK, and the steak taco 'Fat Man in a Little Skirt,' which was outstanding. My wife also really enjoyed her fried chicken taco, and the Kids Taco was tasty enough to get a few bites out of my always fussy six-year-old.  We really enjoyed our first visit to RuRu's, and will definitely be coming back again. There are better Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, but none that serve up the great outdoor dining experience you can find here.",

Parking was a little tricky at first to find but that was based on me bypassing the sign that told me where to park. There wasn't any real designated parking spaces, so thank God it was not busy because people were parking crazy lol. The outside patio was really nice, however we opted to sit inside. Our waitress was.....(I'll get on that later). We ordered the \"this is Sparta \" nachos as an appetizer which were good. I ordered the Gaylord Focker and Stay off My Lawn tacos. The Gaylord Focker although having an interesting description did not quite satisfy my taste buds. The other taco was great! My friend had the Gaylord Focker as well with the grilled mahi taco(can't remember the name). He also felt the same about the Gaylord Focker taco. It was completely vegetarian which I prefer, but the taste was weird. My son had a cheese quesadilla that he enjoyed. ***Back to the waitress*** She was very nice, but she was not attentive and very forgetful. She did not seem new so I could not excuse her. She basically caused a three star review from her lack of attentiveness. We waited 15 minute intervals in between seeing our waitress, which was annoying when we needed things. The restaurant wasn't busy either. I also provided her with a Yelp coupon for buy 2 get 1 free tacos during lunch which she said they accepted, yet I did not receive the discount. Since I knew I would probably wait 10-15 before I saw her face. I left cash and paid the amount on the receipt without the discount. I was a little disappointed in the service and food.",

We ordered the queso dip w chorizo (very small portion with not enough chorizo), death by ruru burrito (crispy pork belly carnitas), fat guy in a lil coat taco (marinated steak), and the white beans.  The server gave a disclaimer that the death by ruru is really spicy which we were excited about since we're from la and enjoy spicy Mexican food. But it wasn't spicy AT ALL. The food we had was good but not worth the price points. Was surprised with how pricey tacos and burritos are here.",

    "text": "Sadly, this is one of the worst dining experiences I've had in recent memory. This was the second try at RuRu's, the first coming shortly after opening. While the first experience was just \"ok\", I figured it was just new place kinks. Unfortunately, if anything, things have gone downhill.   It was a busy night, assuming because it was National Margarita day. We were told there'd be a wait, but it ended up being a brief one. The hostess took my cell phone # to text when the table was available. Great idea, but not particularly helpful since AT&T service doesn't exist in the restaurant. While we waited, we got drinks at the bar. The only redeeming aspect of this visit was that the margaritas were very good and hand shaken. But, the bartender soured those by just tossing the processed check back at us, rather than saying thank you, or actually handing it back.   Once we were seated, things continued to head south. It took over 10 minutes to even be acknowledged. We ordered an app and another drink to start. The waiter forgot both and the kitchen manager (who appeared to be the only hard working person there that night) brought it out to us. The writer was reminded of the drink and eventually brought it over. We were never offered waters and had to ask for silverware. The chorizo queso was both greasy and watery. After about 20 minutes, it thickened up some.   We then ordered the main part of dinner, a sampling of tacos. The kitchen manager brought out the tacos, again, after a fair amount of delay. The waiter must have forgotten to place the order for beans, so the kitchen manager had to go back and bring that out, too. The tacos were fine, but the tortillas definitely felt store bought; far below the quality of Paco's, Bakersfield, Cabo, Three Amigos or any other Mexican place in town.   The waiter never came back to check on us. He seemed to be out of it...not overwhelmed, just completely checked out. I had to shout at the person who appeared to be a manager, partly due to volume, partly because instead of checking on tables or servers, he was just walking around texting on his phone or pouring himself a Coke from the bar (all easily seen from the table we were at). I asked if he was the manager, and he said \"yes.\" I told him I'd like our check, he said \"ok\" and turned around to go get it. He never asked us if everything was ok (hint: if I have to shout at you to get our check - things are not going well) and had the waiter bring the bill.   We paid and left, amazed that a place with such poor service could survive with as much taco competition as there is in south Charlotte. My guess is the patio. The photos probably speak more than my review. Such a shame, this place has so much potential.",

    "text": "Met with friends for dinner tonight and we all ordered tacos. My friend was the lucky one who found a large sharp shard of glass in her taco. It was covered in sauce with veggies and wouldn't notice unless you it. Or almost swallow it.   Thankfully she happened to bite down onto the curved edge of the glass piece and took it out of her mouth before causing any harm. I don't know how that ended up in there but concerning to think that other pieces could be in other plates. It was a big jagged piece of glass at least an inch wide and 2 inches long. It easily could have sliced her tongue or perforated her esophagus if  swallowed.  We let our waiter know and showed him the piece of glass. He took the shard of glass and the rest of her taco and said \"he'd take care of it\" which we assumed would mean some kind of effort or gesture from the manager/restaurant....Just for context- I promise I don't spend my evenings writing angry Yelp reviews about finding a hair in my food or that my table was located too close to the bathrooms.... We were all pretty shocked at their approach to addressing such a dangerous mistake. A sincere apology would be the minimum at most restaurants. Still waiting on the sincere apology. Instead RuRu's was kind enough to remove two tacos off of my friends tab. One taco with glass and one $3 taco on the house! Everything else remained full price with an included but not deserved 20% gratuity. Our waiter informed us this was all the manager would let him take off. Thanks RuRu's!",

    "text": "If you are looking for good tacos, great [tequila] drinks and a bumping patio RuRu's is the place for you.  My fiance and I came here Saturday night for date night. Let me preface this review saying to call us taco fanatics, doesn't even do it justice.  Rolling up around 6:30pm, I knew we'd have to wait for a table, NOPE. The hostess gave us the option to sit inside or outside, so we opted for outside. Our visit was off to a great start. *Protip- make sure you see the host to be seated*  The grub: +Ma The Meat Loaf - chunky guac. Though this isn't the best guac I've stumbled upon it is solid. If you are looking for a guac fix, it will help you out in a pinch. +I'll Have What She's Having (Taco) - Grilled Mahi Mahi, avo and the PERFECT amount of pineapple salsa. +That's Not a Snowflake (Taco) - Tofu with sauteed onions, peppers, and black beans. This was incredible. Tofu is tricky to make in crispy taco form, but they pulled out all the stops.  +Get Off My Lawn (Taco) - Jalapeno pepper stuffed with shrimp and cheese with pickled cabbage. WOW! When you say spicy, sign me up. This is a taco you need to try. Adventurous come calling because this is unlike anything I've had and this would be the reason to come back for more.  +Why So Serious (Taco) - This is your basic mom taco, think ground beef, cheese, lettuce, pico. I didn't hear any complaints about this taco!  +Fired on Your Day Off (Taco) - a buffalo chicken taco topped with lettuce, cheese and ranch. I mean, come on, how can you go wrong with buffalo chicken + taco combo?  The libations: +Friend Zone- House marg and oh, boy, this was delish.  +It's Already Been Brought - a combo drink of, a frozen marg, agave, lime, triple sec and topped off with peach puree and sparkling wine. I had no idea what to expect when I got this, but it was strong, fruity and hit the perfect spot for a summer patio drink.  Overall, I cannot wait to come back. We've already been talking this place up for the past two days. The service was great. We were in and out in 45 minutes and didn't feel rushed. Come here to enjoy the great outdoors, tacos and tequila!   Oh, they have ample parking in the back.",

I mean it came with queso and guac but come on. I think it's called three amigos. Every other Mexican restaurant I've ever patroned has always given free chips and salsa. I got the Clarence beeks burrito which was pretty much all beans and rice. I think I got three or four bites of the tough steak. My gf ordered the chicken and shrimp fajitas that were disenchanting. Bland bland bland. Didn't even come with rice and beans and I believe they were at least $20. We sent them back and got a quesadilla to go instead which was also underwhelming :(.

My friends and I were very impressed by the portion sizes of the tacos and the variety that this restaurant offers. I really enjoyed how they had a good balance of vegetables to protein and that they had a lot of options to choose from. Not to mention that their menu was also so fun and hilarious. One of the tacos is called \"I'll have what she's having\" and it was a title that made our night. Be careful about what you choose though because some tacos were a standout whereas the other ones were just mediocre. The group of favorite was the jalapeno stuffed cheese tacos, followed by tacos that had fried fish, and our lease favorites were the chicken based tacos and the steak tacos. I would recommend this place for a good friend get together or if want good Mexican food. Last thing, the churros were also a hit but the cheesecake was not so popular among my friends.",

But their service is awful if you come any time that they're remotely busy. The last time we were there, It took our server forever to get to us. We placed a drink order and it took almost 15 minute to get them out. By the time the server came to take our dinner order we had already decided to leave for somewhere else. It was the second time in a row this had happened to us, and after the second time trying Ruru's I'd rather spend my time somewhere else.",

    "text": "One of the best patios in town, RuRu's is a great place to spend a summer afternoon outdoors. The margarita and drinks menu is top notch, beer selection is fairly extensive, and we've never had a bad appetizer. The \"street\" tacos are inexpensive and show great variety and uniqueness. Their fajitas are great (recommend mixing shrimp, chicken and steak, for a minimal upcharge), and they will double the meat for a small price increase. The service here is a little hands-off once you receive your food/drinks, but otherwise attentive and fast to place orders and bring beverages/food. The decor is super chill, feels very much like \"old Mexico\"; lots of dark wood and terracotta tile. Love the communal benches in the main room, similar to a taproom. We recently had a company event in their private room, which is great for parties of 8 to 12 (maybe more?), and received perfect service and food.  The parking is confusing until you realize there's a huge lot in back, though it is often full. The place swings on weekends, expect a wait.  Downside: sometimes on weekends or evenings they have live musicians on the patio, and they set them up by the open door to the host stand, it can make the entire place a bit loud, inside and out, and the acoustics suck - so it's not even that enjoyable.   Absent the musicians, this place is a solid 5 Stars, and we return regularly. Apparently we're not alone, as we have seen local sports superstars and recognizable Hollywood stars here as well.",

We showed up around 7 p.m. and the parking situation was a little gnarly but, thankfully, there were spots available on the green patch of grass that's a little further down from their paved lot.  Since it was a beautiful night out, we chose to sit outside at the bar. There was no wait so we grabbed a couple of seats and were greeted promptly. We started out with a margarita (me) and beer on draft (for him). We also ordered guacamole and salsa for our appetizers. The chips are very hearty, just wish they had a little more seasoning/salt.  For our main entrees, I went with the get off my lawn taco and it's all ball bearings rice bowl. He went with the Clarence beeks steak burrito and lookin good Louis taco. My bowl was massive and I ended up having it for three more meals later on in the week (big plus!) The taco was excellent, right amount of heat and flavorful.  I think for my next visit, I'll focus more on the tacos since that's what they're known for.",

    "text": "This place was so awesome I came home tonight and immediately opened my computer to share the wealth.  I first heard about this little strangely named taco joint on Cinco de Mayo.  All the cool kids were doing it, but the wait was THREE HOURS.  Tell me, who the hell waits three hours for tacos?!  I was not about to play that game.  But a non-assuming Monday night for a friend's birthday? YEP.  I'll start by saying RuRu's needs better signage out front. The parking is a bit confusing, but just go around back (that is NOT what she said).  After you actually find the restaurant it is stunning!  A lovely patio, wooden bar, antique with a touch of modern.  Very, very cool.  While I'm talking about decor, I will also mention that the artwork (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fallisonsprockfineart.com&s=30330091ba6a87a85b49b443373289ba552b8824552c6406e2fdbe1711f30aba\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">allisonsprockfineart.com</a>) was so cool that I texted pictures of it to my friends and the music had me singing almost every tune.  Very laid-back vibe, in an upbeat way - if that makes sense?  THE FOOD First, we got a kick out of reading the menu.  All the dishes have one-liner names.  I ordered the Alliteration something Louis, which means shrimp tacos with a side of the Tuscan white beans.  Mostly I ordered the white beans because I just worked out, was super hungry, and was afraid that two tacos wouldn't fill me up.  But let me just preach really quick - I would have eaten a serving bowl of those freaking beans.  I have no idea how the hell they did that but the beans had a creamy tomato sauce with a hint of lemon. Sounds weird, but wow wow wow.  The beans are pretty much the reason I'm even writing this review at all.  We got the three amigos (or something) appetizer, that had guac, salsa and queso and everyone was raving about how good the guac was.  It was fresh and chunky with the perfect compliment of tomato, onion and seasoning.  Plus, warm chips (shiver).  One girl got the Korean Taco, which sounded like it would be overwhelming, but it was really, really good.  I will probably get that next time.  I also heard great things about the mahi mahi.  Actually, now that I think about it, no one had a complaint the entire time.   We all agreed that RuRu's puts Cabo and Bakersfield to shame a little - sorry guys!  DRINKS There are specials every night, and the cocktail list was impressive.  They are $9.75/each, which could get pricey.  But the specials and the beer list were on par.  SERVICE As a waitress, there is something intimidating about seating 6 girls.  I know this because I did it for years.  Our waitress was excellent and had really hot white/purple hair (not important, but still worth noting).  She gave us all great suggestions and was nice enough to help us split the bill at the end which is always a pain.    OVERALL Overall RuRu's is fab!  It would be a perfect romantic date spot or girls night out.  It's fun and delicious and I can't wait to go back.",

It was obvious to me as a Chef, that nobody really cared about the food that was being sent out. Seasoning went from overly aggressive, to none at all.

Another thing that made me chuckle; $4.00 (or$4.25) for a single taco. Anyway, started with the chips and queso. The queso was good, but it was a bit runny. I guess I prefer mine so it actually stays on the chip. For my entree I got the \"stage 5 clinger\", the \"long duk dong\" and the \"I'll have what she's having.\"  The long duk dong, which was a Korean style steak taco, was the clear winner in the group. It had the most meat and most flavor of my trio. Now, the \"I'll have what she's having?\"  Totally underwhelming. It came with a tiny strip of dry mahi mahi that I would be embarrassed to serve. Seriously, the avocado slice was bigger than the fish.   Between the movie references and the creative tacos, I wanted to love this place, but I feel like it just missed the mark. With a few minor tweaks, I really think I could love it.   The server was terrific though.",

We went on Sunday for lunch and it was the perfect time, not too crowded and attentive service.  First thing, the menu is riddled with movie quotes and characters and it took us 10 minutes just laughing at all the famous lines before we even started looking at what each one actually was. We started with the Three Amigos, salsa, guac and queso. The salsa was amazing and fire roasted but the real winner here was the guac, it had so much flavor and I couldn't get enough! We were both drawn to the Friend Zone margarita which was refreshing with the orange juice and lime juice, so  naturally we ordered two rounds.   Finally and most importantly the tacos. The \"Long Duk Dong\" was a favorite, korean beef was tender and so flavorful. \"Fat Guy in a Little Coat\" was also a great taco with the grilled skirt steak. There are so many more tacos on the menu and I want to try them all. Can't wait for my next visit to RuRu's!",

If the audience is one seeking non -authentic chain-quality food, this makes it (not sure if it is even part of a larger group of restaurants- but the food seems geared for a non-discriminating suburban crowd).  The menu was interesting and cute but I wish they had spent the same amount of time developing a more flavorful group of foods. One exception was the wings appetizer which I felt was excellent and might be the only reason I'd return.   Main course of fajitas looked nice and the chicken was well-grilled but the accompanying peppers and onions seemed like they had been prepared earlier and were kept warm and soggy until time to use. This was probably the most flavorless serving of this dish I'd ever had. Needed seasoning and freshly grilled peppers and onions. No avocado provided (probably was for an extra price). Just a little grated American cheese and sour cream. Rice and beans served with this did not excite me.   Shrimp and chicken tacos ok but lacked flavor. Quesadillas were better.   Oh well. Try it and draw your own conclusions.",

    "text": "First impression: RuRu's has a beautiful location, a lovely outdoor patio, and a wonderfully unique TexMex menu.   My husband and I walked from a nearby wine tasting Fri evening to check out RuRu's for our first time. There was a fairly long wait, but we didn't have to wait as long as expected.   The cocktail menu looked fun and beer menu wasn't too bad - there was a small selection of local drafts...would love to see more local craft options for sure.   For dinner, my husband opted for a burrito covered in queso and I ordered a strip steak and grilled mahi taco with a side of the creamy white beans. The food arrived quite quickly and looked great. As far as actual taste/quality/value, I was disappointed. The steak was rather tough, the tortillas were nothing unique and the contents of the tacos didn't quite fill them enough. The beans were tasty for sure and I can see why they are so popular.   Anyways, cool place and definitely worth a visit, but I think I'll stick with Paco's Tacos for their brisket tacos and Cabo Fish Taco for their delish fish tacos.",

Turn on Fenton, then look for the maroon and yellow sign.   We ordered the Billy Ray Valentine, the queso dip with chorizo, corn relish, pico de gallo, and cilantro. It was yummy.  I ordered the Uncle Buck taco, with fried oysters. I wolfed that down with no shame. I also ordered the Bueller quesadillas, but it was pretty plain.   I'd like to come back again on a weekend night because I'm sure it'll be fun. Nothin like a great patio and good food.",

    "text": "Ruru's tacos are one of my favorite in Charlotte, and the atmosphere just adds to how great this place actually is. It has been a go to for my friends and I for a while now, and the daily drink specials always have us trying something new. Unfortunately, the service the last two times I have dined at Ruru's has been an extreme damper on the night. About a month ago, I came in on a Saturday night with a group of three. We were sitting in a booth enjoying a second margarita after we had finished our tacos, and the MANAGER came over and said, \"can I clear any of these plates out of your way? We have guests who have been waiting on a table for a while\"..... This was completely unprofessional and made us feel very uncomfortable as he kept peering around the corner to see if we were getting up yet. Thursday night, I dined at Ruru's again, this time also with a group of 3. We enjoyed a beautiful night on the patio but our server seemed as if she hadn't slept in days. She didn't smile once, had zero emotion, and literally seemed as if she was moving in slow motion. She was incapable of explaining the drink special to us, and her only drink suggestion was a $16 shot of tequila. I sat and waited for a margarita as my friends drank theirs, and our waitress walked around aimlessly as if she had nothing to do. The food came out in a timely manner and as she brought it to the table, I told her I was still waiting on my drink. Her response was, \"they're making it\"...  Sadly these last two experiences have left me feeling different about what I have always considered a wonderful restaurant. I hate to see one of my favorite places in Charlotte go downhill, but the staff needs a serious wake up call! Maybe next time I will do a take-out order so I can still enjoy the delicious tacos, but not have to worry about the staff's lack of people-skills :)",

It would be a great place to take a date. The inside seating is adequate, but go for the outdoor if given a choice.  If you like fancy drinks they have you covered. If you're a beer lover they don't really hold a candle to all of the places in Charlotte to get fine beer. One of my favorite drinks is the \"You talkin' to me?\" jalapeno margarita (better than Paco's).   Food-wise they have a pretty nice menu, a little short on veg options but it always tastes great and that's what matters. I usually get the \"That's not snowflake\" tacos with chipotle vinaigrette instead of the chipotle sauce (the sauce has cream in it). If I'm in the mood for eating a lot of food the \"You Got No Legs, Lt. Dan\" fills the belly quite nicely. Also, to there credit, they actually know how to cook tofu, which is rare for non-Asian places.  I definitely recommend trying out RuRu's. Get a seat outdoors if you can!",

My bride and I went on a Thursday evening and had the Three Amigos trio (Salsa/Guacamole/Queso) and a couple margaritas for the first round.  We then dove into the 'It Was The Dukes\", \"Fat Guy in a Little Coat\", \"Looking Good Louis\", and \"Long Duk Dong\".    Overall it was pretty good but I'd say a tick expensive for what you get.  Our bill with tip was over $80.  The Three Amigos trio was wonderful but enough for 4 people.  The \"Looking Good Louis\" was our favorite taco as the others seemed to lack seasoning and depth.  I wouldn't say they are the best taco option but if you are in that area and want a wonderful vibe with a great bar, give it a shot!  The margaritas are $9.75 but quite the upgrade if you want better tequila.  The shot of Don Julio Reposado was $14 so quite steep compared to other places like ... other local taco/tequila options.  I would rate 3.5 stars so I'll round up and visit again for final thoughts.",

We came for lunch on a Friday afternoon and though the place was almost empty, the service was poor and slow and we barely made it back to work on time. We started with chips and queso, the chips were stale and the queso was bland. We had a total of 5 tacos between the two of us and we thought the steak taco was the best while the rest were not anything impressive. The mahi mahi was way over cooked and the tortillas seemed microwaved and like something from the grocery store. The lettuce on the tacos was soggy and seemed either old or also microwaved for some reason, regardless it was not fresh.  The one star for this place is really only for the ambiance on the patio, though some of the plants looked a little rough and the inside didn't seem particularly clean. Save your money and go to Cantina 1511 down the road for better food and service, plus complimentary chips and salsa.",

With clever names inspired from cult movie classics and $5 drink specials daily, RuRu's is quickly becoming my new favorite Mexican spot! The only negative thing I have to say is that the service was a little slow --- but I also realize that we were the only table on a rainy Sunday afternoon and that we were seated out of view of the waitstaff.

What the heck - I understand not volunteering straws but to have a full bar and not even carry them? And how am I supposed to drink a frozen margarita in a frozen mug with no straw? It was far too cold to hold. They brought me a spoon for the margarita, which was not ideal. This really hampered my experience, and I NEVER would have ordered a drink had I known there were no straws.   My salad had no dressing yet a mound of sour cream despite the fact I had asked for no dairy. They remade the salad for me. I don't know who wants a cup of sour cream on their salad though?   Please start carrying straws!!",

We got the Three Amigos and substituted the regular queso for the Billy Ray Valentine and everything was delicious! I especially loved the guac--I found it refreshing and fresh tasting--and my boyfriend loved the queso and salsa. We each ordered a couple of tacos to supplement our dips, but honestly would've been fine with just one because we left absolutely stuffed. We both agreed that the Long Duck Dong was the best taco of the bunch. It is Korean-style beef and is scrumptious! I can't wait to go back and try some more. They also have tres leches and churros for dessert, but we were too full to try either. Next time I hope!",

The trio is ~$15 but seriously a large portion! Their chips are very good and you can tell they are made in house. They aren't overly salted either which is nice.   I ordered the grilled chicken taco and the grilled mahi taco. Each taco is ~$4 give or take depending on the ingredients.   The restaurant is beautiful and gives a sort of old world feel. The patio area outside is one of my favorites in CLT.   Tonight we waited about 30 minutes to be seated for dinner. It was no big deal we sat outside until it started to rain. When we were finally called for our table we waited about 10 minutes before someone came to our table. Service was a little slow to start but our waitress was attentive and sweet.   These are definitely some of my favorite tacos in CLT. Margaritas next time!",

We pulled into the parking lot and I was impressed with the building itself, like a spanish mansion with a romantic vibe.   I loved the (Its Probably Not Even A Crime These Days) fried Mahi taco with crunchy and tangy slaw, chipotle aioli, so much flavor! I also enjoyed the (Gaylord Focker) veggie taco with roasted cauliflower, fried zucchini, avocado aioli, and more yummy hot pink pickled cabbage, the hot pink color makes for some beautiful photos. Empanadas were ok, I grew up eating them so I'm a little biased, I think they should be served with hot sauce like Valentina instead of the creamy one. Tres Leches cake was lovely, sweet and creamy. Food came out super fast and service was good.   Enjoy reading the menu names, hilarious! Love that they stopped purchasing plastic straws but they need to purchase a eco-friendly alternative. We came on a game night for Panther's football and the restaurant wasn't full, perfect! The game was being shown at the inside and outside bar. This restaurant's interior wasn't as impressive as its outdoors.",

The tacos are tacos, which means at worst they're not bad. You can also buy fajitas for 17 dollars.  Like any trendy Charlotte joint - nice building with a cool atmosphere, good place to have a sick jawline and cool faux hawk that blends into a slick beard real smooth. You can look hot here for sure. The after party is at Rosemont bro. Savage.",

I had shared an appetizer of queso and ordered empanadas, and then two tacos.. I did have to get a doggie bag because I couldn't finish everything. I really enjoyed the patio even though it was pretty crowded I got seated quicker than they told me the wait would be.

Not that big of a deal overall I will definitely be going again and again",

    "text": "This is probably one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. I went to Ru Ru's last night around 8:30pm. It was little busy but not crazy. We had a 15 minute wait for a table for two inside. The restaurant has nice decor and a very fun atmosphere. I was expecting a great experience. Once we were finally sat, our server came over and took our drink orders pretty quickly. Once she came back with the drinks she asked if we wanted any of the tequila specials and apps. We ordered the basic queso and I got an 1800 tequila upgraded to a margarita per her suggestion. She left quickly even though we were ready to order. She didn't ask. The queso was okay and the margarita had a huge bite and needed more simple syrup or less lime juice. Our queso and drink came in a timely manner. The server came back and asked if we were ready to order. We each ordered TWO tacos. She didn't ask how my drink was or the queso. At this point we were starving. We gave her our order. I figured (due to her leaving quick) that she may have had a lot of tables to serve. This is were it took a huge turn for the worst...  After taking our orders she didn't come back to check on our table at all. She didn't refill our waters or come back to pick up the dishes from the queso. About 10 minutes after we ordered I got her attention while she  was at a nearby table and asked her if my wife could get a refill on her water, which had only ice left. The pitchers of water were literally a few feet away near the entrance to the patio. She said okay and walked off. She never came back. None of the other servers ever came over to check in or refill it either. About 10 minutes after we asked her for the water I just got up and asked another server to please refill it. He did and I went back to my table. At this point it had been 20 minutes since we ordered our food. We were very irritated. Our orders were very simple. No adjustments. Just 2 freaking tacos for each of us. We waited 10 more minutes. At the 30 minute mark I went up the the host and told her we needed our check and never got our food. The server overheard and said \"Oh, you never got your food.\"  No, we didn't and she never came to even check on us. The same guy who refilled our water came over and said we were free to go. Where the heck was the manager?! He asked if we wanted the food to go and we declined. At this point we had been there an hour and it was past 9:30.   I've been a server before and we all make mistakes but to be 1) inattentive, 2) completely ignore a simple request, and 3) never place our food order is completely unacceptable. I can tell from personal experience that this restaurant does not have systems in place to make sure these things don't happen. Please train your staff to 1) work as a team, 2) check back in with guests when they receive their food, 3) run their own food so that they know it's been delivered or to pay attention to their table's tickets, 4) have the manager check in with tables during busy hours to ensure everything is being handled properly, and 5) limit how many tables your server can have because it reduces mistakes. These are the basics of good customer service. We tip well and just wanted a great dinner experience at a new place that we've heard about. We will not be eating here again. It has great potential but they need more customer service training. Super disappointed.",

Parking can be hard to find, as the lot in front of the restaurant is small, although there are a couple of parking lots closeby within walking distance.   Now, about the food. My go-to is the buffalo chicken taco. The chicken has a good crunch, but the real winner is the buffalo sauce. Tangy and spicy, it goes well with the cheese and sour cream. Pair it with a corona, and you've got a winner.",

It took about 20-30 minutes to get our main entrees, however we only received half of the orders. It took a full 10 minutes to get the rest. By this time, those that had already received theirs were done eating. By the time the 2nd half of our table received food the bar area was packed and it was so loud we couldn't hear each other without screaming. Needless to say, we were ready to get out of there.",

You can see it off the road, but the parking lot is a bit tricky as  you have to whip around the block and park.  I noticed while eating that people came in all disoriented since the host table is located at the back door where the patio is, so if you come in the front door you have to traverse the entire restaurant to see the hostess and get seated.  Food is solid... servers are friendly... however a bit slow.  It's fine if you aren't pressed for time, but when the dining room is half full and you have to flag someone down to get refills and the check, it's a bit disconcerting.  The food has some memorable names and you can tell the kitchen has some creative juices flowing back there.  The main draw would be the tacos, but they have other offerings:  quesadillas, burritos, salads, and rice bowls.  Something for everyone.  Great location in Myers Park, however you need to find it.... If you live in the neighborhood, it's probably best to walk here.  I haven't tried to ride a bike here, but then again I haven't seen any bike parking close-by.",

Hostess was uninterested and sat is at a dirty table. Charged for chips and salsa- chips were stale. Guac was good but $9.00!!! Not worth it Hardly any veggie options.  Food was decent but so unauthentic. I've had PB&Js in tortillas that were more Mexican. Service was below average. Nice waitress but seemed to be too busy.  I felt like a sucker for paying for this place. Will not be returning. $45 for two people- nope.",

I came alone on a Saturday afternoon and service was terribly slow and almost nonexistent.  The food can only be described as mediocre at best.  The queso was the best thing I had and it left much to be desired. I also had the crispy chicken tacos and the Korean steak taco. Both were bland  and the steak was tough.    I will continue to visit Bakersfield for my taco and tequila fix.",

I got so full on guacamole that I ordered the small \"Bend and Snap\" salad and was completely satisfied.   Ruru's supports Charlotte's local breweries and, much to my delight, serves Birdsong's Jalapeno Pale Ale which pairs masterfully with Mexican food!   The only down side of Ruru's is that they're kind of hard to find. I was able to snag a parking spot in the front lot, but quite honestly don't have a clue how to find the secret back parking lot. I'll worry about that on another day!  Ruru's also has a fabulous patio, but it was 1,000+ degrees last night so we didn't get to sit outside. I vow to return in cooler weather to find the secret back parking lot and enjoy patio dining.   Ruru's is quite a little gem nestled discretely in Myers Park!",

The frozen margs remind me of an island oasis drink machine - very fine texture.   Tacos are great, but I need 3 for a meal. The house beans are what really shine for me - I order them every time.   The burritos are also good, nothing mind blowing - but tasty.   I wish there were some combo entrees - the a la carte menu leaves me hungry or with a steep bill.",

More time should be spent adding taste to the food Instead of concocting corny names for the menu items. Chips were stale. Salsa was good, not great. Chicken for fajitas was legit but rest of items on the plate were bland.   Service ranges from inconsistent to inattentive. But friendly. Just seemed the management and processes were lacking.   Given the cool patio setting, it should be one of the most festive environments around but the strange house music selections made it awkward.   Margaritas: the spicy one was too sweet. The frozen house margarita was better.   This place could be a winner if they get it together , if not, it's just an also ran with a high rent payment.",

    "text": "I am going to start by reminding you that I am not a Chef. I have though, eaten in some of the best restaurants in the US. And....my mother cooks for my daughter and I, Hispanic Soul food almost every night (yes, be jealous). I went to RuRu's on a Sunday with my girls to catch up. We are a great big happy bunch. We don't look for faults we are looking for a good time being that we are all mommys and we need it! RuRu's had an amazing selection of Tequilas (for being a little Charlotte Restaurant). Their drinks though(specifically my strawberry margarita) reminded me of a drink that I would get served in club. You know...the grown drink. That is not necessarily bad...but..who wants to be grown while drinking a Margarita?! Ok, fine. Move on to the appetizers. We ordered the Queso with Chorizo (Queso: watery with kind of a corner filled with chorizo grease). Tasty but not impressed. And the nachos with no meat. Super Duper plain. Ok fine. So I asked our server which was his favorite Taco. He said the Korean duck something. Ok, cool. Let me try it.  This is where I have a problem. This is obviously and \"upscale\" Mexican/bar/restaurant...I asked for a corn tortilla. Obviously, these are bought at the Harris Teeter down the corner because they weren't fresh nor hand made, which is very easy to do. The duck tasted extra sweet and like marinated flank steak. Ok, fine. I asked him later to bring me the Mahi Mahi with cilantro and pineapple. I imagined a seared Mahi marinated, tangy, lime, fresh pineapple...Nope. This tasted/ look like two small pieces of fried tenders to fit in the very tasteless corn tortilla with a couple of tiny pieces of plain pineapple and a bunch of cilantro. Common guys!!!! It's not that hard to get tacos right? A fancy name to a taco doesn't mean quality....Ok fine. I had fun with my girls..but...not coming back. I suggest you watch the Episode of a Chef's Table on Netflix featuring the Mexican Chef and his journey to make the perfect taco with original ingredients. Inspiring and NOT HARD!",

I love the old Spanish style building, the stucco, red tiles, bright umbrellas on the patio...reminds me of my days in Miami in Coral Gables. The menu was simple which was nice because some Tex-Mex places go overboard with their offerings. We started with the chips and salsa. The chips were warm, salsa was chunky and flavorful. If you're dining with little people like I tend to, the salsa is kid friendly but packs a nice flavor. For dinner, my kids ordered tacos and a quesadilla which were generous in size. The kids meals include a drink...the quesadilla was $5 and the tacos were 2/$6. I ordered three tacos ($4-$4.75 each) and my husband ordered a rice bowl (about $9) My tacos could have been more flavorful and they would have tasted better on corn tortillas. The service was excellent. Our server was friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back sans kids for a date night because the drink menu looked amazing. Next time I'll order the rice bowl (It was so good!)",

I know its \"Myers Park\" but for the price of the food that they charge they need to give you chips and salsa. I asked for salsa when they served my lunch and I was charged $1.50 for a very small bowl. I dont like to be nickled and dimed and thats what it felt like.  I ordered the chicken quesadilla which was $12.00 and no sides. Expensive for a quesadilla but i will say it was very good. I'm not sure if I will go back.

I rechecked the menu and it did say SEASONED SHRIMP.  My seven shrimp were as white as could be with no sight of seasoning anywhere. My wife couldn't eat it so she ordered the Chicken Burrito. Our daughter had ordered this before and enjoyed it so it seemed like a safe bet. WRONG! Another Luke warm flavorless dish. The ratio of chicken to rice was won by the RICE!

I got a large burrito called Death by RuRu's and it was great, the chicken was a bit dry but overall had good flavor. I recommend it to anyone who like classic Mexican food.  Service: Everyone was very friendly, I didn't have any negative experiences with any of the staff. The employees were smiling and being extremely nice throughout the whole service, and I was with quite a large group.   Inside Restaurant: The environment was great with the music and lights. It's a very positive and cheerful environment. Really good for date nights or outing with your family. There was also live music at the time I arrived and it brought the whole place to life. (The bathrooms were clean and kept up pretty nicely as well).   Overall the reason I only gave 3 stars was because the environment outshined the food in my opinion, although the food tasted pretty good it wasn't AMAZING.  But if you enjoy Mexican food with an American twist then you should enjoy this place very much.",

They could go a long way with a better house margarita and not being too stingy to give out a basket of chips.",

    "text": "Awesome Mexican and taco spot with creative menu item names! The patio is one of the best in Charlotte (especially at night) and the menu has over 15 different tacos all for right around $4 (they're a great size too). Arguably the best tacos I've had in Charlotte here and the Margaritas are great and are only $5 on Mondays. The only thing that stands out here warranting the 4 stars is that the chips and salsa isn't free (a big thing that stands out to a lot of people). Not only is it not free, but you're charged in full if you get more on top of what they bring when you first order it. While it's great salsa (with lots of full chunks), it's still something that most places wouldn't charge for which can add an extra $5+ to your meal. Overall, a great spot though!",

Before I review the food I want to start off by saying that the building that the restaurant is located in is beautiful. It's a Tuscan /Spanish architecture type of building. Now on to the food and service my brother and I were quickly greeted and seated. The menu has vegetarian options which is a plus. I decided on \" I love the smell of Nepalm\" which is the vegetable fajitas with tofu. The entree was good but it wasn't anything that stood out to me entirely. Also, this place is different in the sense that chips and salsa aren't offered on the house. The food is also a tad overpriced. Our server was friendly and checked in on us frequently. Would I go back again just based on the food alone? Probably not but this place is worth a try.",

The food was outstanding and seasoning was phenomenal!!! They even had some fun names for all of their food and drinks. We went on a Thursday and they had half off all tequila and margs for $3 extra and buy two tacos get one free! Atmosphere was very laid back and photogenic. They have outdoor seating and allow cats and dogs. We brought a dog and they even gave her a dog bowl full of water. Not sure why this place has 3.5 stars but they deserve far more! This is for sure my new fave spot for Mexican food. Food pictured: \"I am McLovin\" chips and queso (my favorite part of this meal), Tacos: \"I'll have what she's having\", \"Fat guy in a little coat\" and \"Long duck dong\".",

The patio area was very warm, inviting, and they had heaters out there.   I got 2 of the $2 tacos which for that night was a pork one and a meatball one. I also got another which was $3 or $4 and it had fried chicken in it and some other delicious stuff. The only thing I thought was a rip off was the margarita I got. It was $8 or 9 and honestly was so small to me... (given I was comparing this to just going to a regular mom and pop hispanic place and how BIG their margaritas are for the same price). However, the tacos were great and filling and a good size. They had some really neat flavor combos. All of the other stuff on the menu besides tacos looked yum and I noticed healthier options too.   I would definitely head back there and check them out if you haven't already",

They charged me $1.50 for the very small condiment sized salsa, are you kidding me? Second, I ordered an extra Taco, it never came and no one noticed until after dessert my server mentioned did I ever get it, I asked them to cancel!! Management came by to apologize which I appreciate but the damage was done customer wise.

There is a small parking lot on Providence and a larger parking lot behind the building that's a little hard to find. I recommend parking in the lot off of Fenton Pl. and walking in thru the patio area. The hostess puts your name on the list and asks for your cell phone number so they can text you when your table is ready.   We had chips and salsa, the You Talkin to Me margarita, and a la carte tacos.   The Fat Guy in a Little Coat taco ($4.29) was ok. It had a weird sauce on it that tastes more like mayonnaise than avocado aioli. The sauce was off putting.  The Slappin the Bass taco ($4.29) was ok. There was a LOT of breading on the fish (more breading than fish). I removed half of the breading before eating.   It seems to be a popular place, but I think I'll continue my search for great tacos in Charlotte.",

The Mahi Mahi mixed with the sweet and fruity pineapple salsa really hit the spot.  All the protein was cooked to perfection and the toppings were crisp and fresh.

    "text": "Talk about a patio at this great taco place!  So many good reasons to love this hot spot. First and foremost I find the food to be absolutely delicious and very reasonable for the quality!  I have to say I keep wanting to try something other than tacos but I like them too much!  I have had a side salad which was very well topped and prepared.   Patio on fleek!  This place has a nice balance of shaded areas for lunch, and cool light strings across in the evening. The outdoor bar gazebo is also very large. The inside is nice as well, though the patio is where it's at if the weather is cooperative.   The staff is always very friendly and service is pretty quick once you are seated. The drinks are also very good here I must say. And of course the names of both the drinks and the meals are very unique.   Finally, make sure to take note of the parking lot off Fenton Place and tell your first time friends meeting you there. The address location being Providence Rd and having that small lot in the front makes it a bit tricky your first time at the Ru.",

    "text": "We came to Ru Ru's on Sunday and left with an A-OK experience!  Absolutely love the patio here! Fortunately we were able to grab a seat on the patio. It was a bit disappointing when it started to rain and no one working there even offered to help move people. Fortunately, my husband and a nice guy sitting next to us moved some umbrellas around to cover us. In retrospect, it was actually kind of nice dining in the rain.   Love the menu....everything is named from movie quotes, which is just so fun. I learned that my movie knowledge is very limited cause I was struggling with naming the movie!  Anywho, both my husband and I got the Noda Gordgeous.....I know it's not fall yet, but man, that drink is good!!   This isnt one of those places that they just immediately bring you out some salsa. We decided to go with the Billy Ray Valentine, which is a chorizo queso dip. Decent size portion and pretty tasty.....that dish definitely was definitely empty by the end of the nide. We also decided to split 3 tacos: Snowflake, I'll have what she's having, and the shrimp one. They came out super super quick. The Snowflake was not my favorite....i think it may have had a little too much sauce on it cause that is all i tasted. Crazy enough, it was my husbands favorite. Agree to disagree. The shrimp was pretty good. However, the I'll Have What She's Having was rock on solid. The fruit in it made the taco!  I really hate to talk about service because I think waiters and waitresses are truly some of the hardest working people ever and get very little credit. However, service was very off. Things forgotten, wrong items brought out, super slow. Honestly, I am totally ok with off service (as we are all human and have bad days) but there wasn't even a recognition of/apology the forgotten/wrong items and slowness. Unfortunately, the couple beside us was complaining too.   All in all, it was a pretty good experience.   I know you guys are trying to be a \"nice\" Mexican place, but pretty pretty please get some free chips and salsa in the mix and I'll be a happy camper!",

We were also told that all tacos were two dollars on Tuesdays. when we got our check, we were charged full price for all tacos and drinks. Over $100 for 2 guests. When we brought this to the managers attention, he told us that the drinks are half off only for the tequila that is in the drink not for the whole drink!! Really!!!  He continued to say that they only had two feature tacos for two dollars. He did not offer to make it good in anyway. Disappointed in the lack of service and misrepresentation. Food was not all that good. The server told us that they're trying to save the planet so no straws were offered! Red lipstick on the water glasses!! Definitely not washed properly WOW!!! Just an overall disappointment we won't go back.",

I'm from California and am pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of Mexican food in Charlotte. I highly recommend it. My favorite items are the Quesadillas.",

They have live music on Wednesdays which was nice but got to be a little too loud if you're having conversation at your table with more than one person.   Service was very slow, we were there for almost two hours and waited probably 15 minutes each time we ordered drinks. It seems as if they had to go inside for the drinks each time even though there's a bar outside which seemed odd.   We got the three amigos appetizer which included salsa, guacamole, and queso. The guac and queso were great, the salsa tasted like it came from a jar. I got two tacos, and they were just OK. Nothing compared to Paco's Tacos. Would not come back for the food, but definitely for a nice night on the patio.",

I had the Shirley you're not serious. They had a drink special that was so good we ordered 3 of them. We were celebrating my girlfriend's birthday and we stopped there for dinner before heading out. Now flip that with my visit on yesterday. I wanted to take my boyfriend there for a nice and funny lunch (the menu is all movie quotes, pretty fun and one of the plus) but it was a totally different experience. The hostess was sooooo rude (yes it deserves that many o's). The waiter was fine, but the hostess put a horrible taste in my mouth. First she sees us walk in, but another waiter that was standing on the other side of the hostess stand had to say you guys will be seated in a little while. I couldn't think of the name of that wonderful drink and tried to describe it, but the bartender absolutely did not hit the mark. It just tasted like sangria. Which makes me sick.  The jasmine bowl was awful. The rice was over cooked and the chicken tasted as if they opened a bag of pre-cooked strips from the grocery store and dumped it in the bowl. I was utterly disappointed. Needless to say, we were not rushing to tell friends about this place. Ugh!  And my first experience was such the draw. And again the ONLY reason for my 2 stars was my first trip to RuRu's.",

    "text": "What a disappointing first experience after hearing good things from others. I realize that they must have been understaffed but the lack of awareness and courtesy is astounding.   After 10-15 minutes, we had to ask a hostess if our table had a server. Our waiter promptly came over and apologized saying he was unaware we were in his section. That's ok. We are reasonable people.   Realizing that things around us weren't going smoothly we decided to put in our entire order (drinks, apps, and dinner) at once bc who knows how long it might take! I guess we should have specified that we wanted our chips and queso before our entree. All of that came at once. And where are our drinks??? I had to ask the hostess to check on our drink order and get us silverware before we could even eat.   As we finished up our entree we were still enjoying queso so we asked for more chips to munch in since we also still had to finish our drinks. Our waiter came to clear some empty dishes while we were finishing up our drinks and chips and took the queso away while we were still eating it! He never asked or anything knowing we had asked for more chips moments before. When I told him what happened but told him not to bring more queso when he offered, he got pissed and asked why we even brought it up. We brought it up because we weren't done!!!   I understand that the waiter was over booked but where was the manager to take some if the heat? Where was the apology for the shifty service??   P.S. To top it off, the bathroom stall I used was out of toilet paper. My husband informs me that the men's room was also out of paper towels.",

The tortillas tasted like they had not touched the grill and came straight out of the packaging. When I tried to lift them off the plate they stuck and broke apart. And has for the fillings inside, the fish was dry. The shrimp was juicy but not seasoned like the photos you see here. Overpriced for average cuisine. The appetizer nachos were okay but well proportioned. I asked for a side of guacamole and that helped. My fiance tried the steak bowl and he enjoyed it. The waitress was very sweet.",

It is dark, extremely noisy and to make it worse the music is loud enough to wake the dead and you will never be able to converse with your party much less the servers. The food is very good although I did have a bad experience with the Uncle Buck tacos last night as the oysters were severely undercooked. Like total mush. I've gotten these several times but they were just cooked wrong last night. The drinks are seriously overpriced but they are good, just not worth $9.75 for a tiny cocktail.  Normally the service has been OK but last night we finally had to get up and ask the host to get a waitress to come over to our table after sitting there for 15 minutes with our menus. I would love to give this place five stars, and if I have a better experience when I go back next time, I will delete this review and rewrite it.",

I've always thought that the back patio is gorgeous and would be a fantastic spot for a restaurant; I am so glad that RuRu's decided to go into this location!  As other reviewers have said, the patio is a-mazing.  I can not wait for nicer weather.  There is an outdoor bar, tv, lots of tables / benches, and a beautiful fountain.    We tried RuRu's on a Wednesday - we arrived around 6:30 and there were plenty of tables available.  When we left at 8, the place was pretty hopping, but I don't believe there was a wait.    The food was good, but it's kind of a bummer that you have to pay $5 for chips and salsa (this made me give 4 stars instead of 5).  We got the chips and queso ($7) and it was delicious.  The chips are homemade and the queso was some of the best I have ever had.  We both got quesadillas for our entrees - womp womp, we are boring.  I guess we covered the melted cheese and bread options they had, though.  They have a fun drink menu and everything on the menu is named after memorable lines / nicknames from movies.  I took a pic of the menu; sorry if it is a little blurry.  I'll definitely be back and absolutely can not wait for warmer weather so we can enjoy the patio out back!",

Things that were bad: rice in rice bowls was undercooked, service was super slow from kitchen and bar (I get it, its a big and busy restaurant - so make your staffing such that people don't want 25 minutes on a margarita), speaking of margarita, our table ordered a few and they were very inconsistent and not tasty.

The bartender was very nice and attentive, maybe that's where we should've stayed. Half an hour later we got our table under the lights. The server was nice, but ether they were very understaffed or she just didn't care, the whole evening went downhill. We ordered our drinks when server finally got to our table, 5 minutes later she came back and took out appetizer order, another 10 minutes later the apps came out, still no drinks, no water and no share plates.. After a few minutes our server showed up with drinks. I understand that she might've been busy, but she didn't even  acknowledge that it took a while. Even though salsa and queso were ordered only one small plate of stale chips was accompanying it. For dinner all the tacos that we tried were very bland.  I'd say, have dinner elsewhere and stop by for drinks at the outside patio. Maybe in time once they sort through all the bad staff and add more flavor to food I'll return for dinner.",

    "text": "I rarely write reviews but do so if service is stellar or dismal.  I am a former longtime Charlotte resident and have eaten at most restaurants ranging from 3 to 5 stars.  RuRu's demonstrated systemic failures on all fronts.  From the pricing, the quality of the food, the timing of the food delivery, and service -- F minus's on all fronts.   Let's start with the food and food service, which should be the focal point.  A party of 5 seated at 8:30 we were directed to a table too small for our group next to a cold exterior wall.  Being a group too large for the size of the table provided, one member sat against the cold wall the entire time.  When I inquired about the larger open table next to it I was told it was not available because the six member party needed that table.  Once seated we should have been provided silverware prior to the food coming.  Moreover, the food should have come out warm (at least) and around the same time.  One member of our party of five waited a full 15 minutes after everyone else was served before his food arrived.  My food was cold - not warm temp but cold.  My husband's steak burrito was 90% rice.  This was how the meal ended.    With cocktails before, we had wine, beer and martini drinkers.  When one member ordered a martini a one ounce shot glass of vodka was provided.  He indicated what he wanted was a martini.  They ultimately provided a martini in a martini glass.  A martini of the exact same size and premium choice that you would get at the Gallery Bar at the Ballantyne Hotel (5 star) or Capital Grille Uptown (equally stellar) cost twice as much at RuRu's.  Beyond NYC prices.  Four martinis cost us $90 and that was without the tip, chilled glass and garnish. The explanation provided by the manager was \"that's just the way we price it\".  Seriously???   Charlotte deserves better.  Living in Atlanta now we have amazing selections.  Charlotte suffers from not having more consistently good quality restaurants.  RuRu's was a severe disappointment -- far below mediocre.",

They could easily turn it into a duck confit taco and it would be amazing. Margaritas are average and too expensive for the size glass you get. Either more tequila or a bigger glass would be fair. Salsa and guacamole were pretty good, if you're interested in paying $6 for each.   The atmosphere and friendly staff save this place from being a 2 star. The service needs to be stepped up. It took us an hour to get 6 tacos on a mildly busy evening. I would recommend this place, however with caution and curbed expectations.",

    "text": "I recently visited RuRu's for dinner with coworkers, and I had a really enjoyable experience.  First, the atmosphere at RuRu's is awesome. It's decorated like a Latina villa inside and has a great exterior seating area that was well-heated and that had a bar. We had great service by the hostess and waiter when they accommodated special seating needs in our party.  My party shared their trio of dips with chips to start. I really liked their salsa because it had the perfect amount of authentic heat to it. The queso and guac were solid, and all the ingredients tasted very fresh.  I ordered two tacos for my main dish. The \"Get Off My Lawn,\" a shrimp stuffed jalapeno with Asian slaw, was a unique take on a taco and was nicely executed. I also ordered the \"That's Not Snowflake\" taco, which is easily the best vegetarian taco I've ever had. Instead of a sad serving of lettuce, pico, and cheese, this special snowflake brings you perfectly crisped tofu with a really divine chipotle sauce. In a world full of tacos, I really thought RuRu's stood out in this department.  Overall, the restaurant had a fantastic atmosphere and good tacos at a good price. While I didn't order a drink, it looked like they had good weekly specials and would love to come back to have a marg on the patio when the weather warms up!",

The sweet and spicy skirt steak was muy delicioso. I just loved the asian and mexican fusion in that taco. Our server, Hunter, was pretty awesome as well. Big shout out to Hunter for handling a large party.   Like many other Yelpers have posted, the parking can be a bit challenging because if you GPS the location, it takes you to the front and there's very minimal parking in the front. You have to go around the corner on Fenton Place and park in the rear. There is olenty of parking in the rear.   My friend was celebrating her birthday, so they gave her complimentary churros, which werr quite delicious!  I absolutely love how their food and drink menu is movie themed. You could definitely make up a game of guess that movie with the one liner menu options for the food and drinks. Real quick, in what movie is there a character named Long Duk Dong? If you don't know Google it!",

There's a random door that says \"open\". It looks like the door for a jewelry store, but you can in fact go to Ruru's through this entrance. I was seated immediately. They don't comp chips and dip, which is bad for the consumer, smart for business because we're just going to buy the chips and salsa anyway. I ordered a grilled chicken taco and a shrimp taco. Like everything on the menu, they had some sort of name that reflected Ruru's theme. I thought the menu could've stood to be more straight forward. The upside to Ruru's is that the food was really good. My drink was weak for $9. I would skip having drinks here. Service is good. Overall, decent experience and I'll be back.  My friend, who is a vegetarian, ordered a steak burrito, subbing steak for tofu and no price adjustment was made.",

To start, I never really appreciate going to a Mexican restaurant and having to pay for chips and salsa.  I get that I am consuming it and they have to pay to make it but industry standards have really set expectations that it be a given. The chips weren't even fresh, they were out of a bag. I ordered a burrito that was mediocre. I'd gotten better from a counter in the back of a grocery store in Detroit. My wife had a quesadilla which only came with sour cream and pico. It would have been nice to have guacamole and lettuce as well.  Overall, we realized that we love the atmosphere but we'd rather go elsewhere to get better food. 2 stars.",

The food was really good and the margaritas strong! They have a really cool outside area too with a bar and heaters. I can't wait to go back when it's warm during the summer. So yes I definitely recommend this place.",

Tip: download app \"Stealz\" and get you free chips and salsa. The \"make it rain\" - saving you $5 bucks, you're welcome. Put it towards a margarita instead!  My rating is 4 stars bc there's always a wait and no reservations, small place so you pay the price there.

I'd visited once before for a Yelp event and instantly became a fan of their patio and live music (that guy is awesome!). This visit was no different, I enjoyed everything!   My friend and I stared with the Billy Ray Valentine. Nikki is absolutely right, it's queso on steroids! Trust me...if you're already a fan of the cheesy goodness, this takes it up a notch by adding chorizo, corn relish and some pico. Delish!!  I tried to get a picture, but my friend and I were finished it too fast.  I ordered two tacos:  Fat Guy in a Little Coat which is their version of a skirt steak taco with avocado aioli and queso topped with cilantro and lettuce. It was very good. The char on the steak was just right and the avocado aioli was a nice touch.   Looking Good Louis which is their shrimp taco with chipotle aioli, lettuce and pico. The shrimp were seasoned nicely and had just the right amount of spice on them. I was a huge fan of the chipotle aioli. Yum.   Our waitress was fun and we just had an overall good time. I will say it can get a bit loud inside once the music starts but just find you way to the patio and you'll be just fine.",

First, it's hard to get to based on its street address -there's nothing that tells you that the entrance is in the back or directing you to walk around and your Uber driver doesn't know where to pick you up. Secondly, what kind of taco place doesn't offer free salsa? When the guy told me I had to pay, I thought he was joking. The drinks were pretty good, until I asked for a straw and was told they don't have them. I thought that was a joke too. The manager said they kill fish and cause cancer (well, he obviously just read the NY Post op ed article and not the actual Stanford University research -straws are less than 1% of the problem and really only give big companies a moral high ground). Well, I hope they wash their glasses thoroughly because I have a virus. The guy behind me was offering $20 for a straw. Anyway, the Long Duck Dong is delicious (Korean BBQ), but the Fat Guy in a Little Coat is very bland. The chicken/avocado/egg/Bibb salad is yummy but needs some spice in the dressing. Overall, there are much better tacos places (with straws).",

Hostess told me and my wife that the wait for both indoor and outdoor seating would be 20-30 minutes, and we let her know that we were fine with first available. We sat at the bar to have drinks while waiting right next to the hostess, and we witnessed her telling some people that the wait was 20-30 minutes while seating others immediately (same # of people in these groups).  Very inconsistent and probably a scam to get people to wait and buy drinks at a bar. When I complained, there was miraculously a table for 2 available (people before us who complained also were seated immediately).    The food was ok but not great by any means, and no free chips (c'mon this is a Mexican restaurant).  And for the grand finale, they don't have straws. I am fine with this as long as there are obvious exceptions such as frozen drinks. So, I would recommend not ordering a frozen drink here (it will be served with a spoon).

We each got two and loved them all.  The food is quite good. The guacamole was very good. They don't quite have as many vegetarian options as I was hoping, BUT the one tofu taco that they have is incredible. I could eat a whole plate of them, so I guess it's not a huge loss for the lack of variety. My dining companion had the mushroom quesadilla and really liked that as well. I got a salad to accompany my taco and it was pretty flat. Not great lettuce, not that many toppings. But I did like the honey lime dressing.  All in all, this is a great spot and I'll be back soon.",

We could choose where we wanted to sit and instead of going with the main dining room we chose the seclusion of the booths upstairs. Bad choice cause it was freezing! LOL. For drinks I went with the frozen strawberry something and I could barely sip anything out of the straw. When it said Frozen it meant FROZEN!  For my entree I went with the quesadilla's which were super boring and probably the most bland I've ever had. Get the taco's instead. Those were pretty good. For dessert we shared the tres leche cake. Totally could have done without the strawberry like frosting on top. All in all just a so so experience. To me for the quality of food we got the bill seemed a little pricey for two people. Good $5 craft cocktail specials though were a good deal.",

Two tacos, a Corona draft, water, and a neat tequila since it was 1/2 priced Thursday, and I sit at the bar.   How can you screw it up?   They didn't!  Maleah, my server was friendly and talked openly about how she likes it here,  how jammed they get,  and what food she recommends.   Cool.  Tacos arrived quickly on a hot plate.  I gobbled 'em down (but nursed the booze).  So good.  I liked the oyster taco the best.  Great joint.  I'm hoping to sit on the rear patio when the weather warms.",

I took her up on the offer and gave RuRu's a second chance. While my meal was good and this time did not have hair it was far from on the house. I was promptly brought a tab despite mentioning the situation. Thank goodness I did bring my wallet with me.   Ordered a burrito from Postmates and some chips w/salsa. Chips and salsa were standard but not worth $5. Went to eat pork belly burrito this morning and found a hair. It went immediately in the trash. Absolutely DISGUSTING! Won't be ordering from here again. If the prices weren't a deterrent ($11 burritos and $4 tacos) then the unsanitary hair in my food certainly is.",

My friends switched to margaritas, which they said were much better.   We shared the three amigos as an appetizer and we were underwhelmed. We liked the queso, but not the salsa (tasted store bought) or the guacamole (which was really just chopped up avocado). The chips weren't particularly good either. We didn't finish any of it.   For the meal, I went with tacos. I ordered the stage five clinger, fat guy in a little coat, and looking good louis. When I ate these, the stars aligned and RuRus had kind of redeemed itself. I loved the tacos and would order those again. My friends got the burritos and they liked them.   In conclusion, I will be back but only for the tacos.",

Also coming off the heels of Pinky's, the service was pretty subpar here. The hostess wasn't particularly friendly. Our waitress (Katie) was somewhat attentive at first and then after we got our food (which someone else brought), she checked on us once and then completely disappeared for about 30 minutes...I sat with an empty water glass for the better part of my meal...and we we sat at our table for like 15 minutes after we finished , waiting for our check.   Somehow our check was about $65 for two people and it didn't feel like anything out of the ordinary. Bottom line, if I came here again it would probably just be to have a specialty cocktail and an appetizer.",

We pulled in the front to the villa area and had to leave to go to the back to find their actual parking area. Front of the restaurant is beautiful. Patio area is nice and would be awesome once the weather is more warm!   When we walked in we were greeted and the hostess got two menus and stood behind us and told us we could sit wherever we want. A little strange since me and my fiance had never been we weren't really sure where to go. You first walk by the bar area and the kitchen is exposed to the other side. We walked into the room where the stairs were and sat at a booth. Decor is nice.   We ordered chips and salsa which were $5. The salsa was good and in a large bowl. Chips weren't that warm. They were more on the thicker side which I like but my fiance didn't care for it since he likes thin and crispy chips.   I got the Korean taco and it was good. Steak was tender and I love the sesame seeds in it. Shrimp taco was probably my favorite. The sauce in it was creamy and went well with the shrimp. I also got the chicken taco. It was good and safe. Nothing special about it.   I would come here again. They are a little pricey for what it is but I do like the style and how you can pick different individual tacos.",

The atmosphere was really cool, and our waitress was very kind and genuine with great recommendations.  We ordered several tacos and apps, and the crispy fried chicken, shrimp, fried oyster, and carnitas tacos were our favorite.  I don't know what they put in that zesty sauce, but it's perfect! I also really liked the balance and texture of the different toppings on each taco. I'd also recommend ordering the special queso to go with the tacos, because isn't everything better with cheese sauce to dip it in?!?  Oh, and the WINGS--- you absolutely have to order the wings!! My husband and I are big foodies, and I have to say, these are the best wings we've ever had.  (I know, weird considering this is supposed to be a Mexican place lol).  The slight crispy texture, the sweet and yet spicy glaze sauce, and the horseradish crema on top were just phenomenal!  Their version of Guac was really the only thing I wasn't a fan of, but other than that, a flawless experience!",

Honestly, it's hard to mess up fresh guacamole when fresh avocados are used (which they are here) but it tasted bland. The tacos are not consistent - some are great and some are just ok.

    "text": "Delicious taco restaurant in Charlotte!  Usually eating indoors it can be loud but still clean and well decorated, the patio is exceptionally clean and a great place to eat.  The tacos are great and have creative names, my favorites are the \"Fat Guy in a Little Coat\" which has skirt steak, and the \"Looking Good Louis\" which has shrimp.  The chips and guac/salsa/queso is super fresh and delicious, and not super filling before your meal.  Overall great restaurant!",

First, the hostess on the phone hung up on me, but not before I heard her say something rude under her breathe. Oops. Not good. Then when we got to to the restaurant, our server was just plain confused- It was like he showed up to work at the wrong restaurant that day. Everything was strange about the people and my whole table of 7 agreed. Maybe next time I'll just go to the bar to avoid the other awkward staff.",

    "text": "Unfortunately knocking my previous four stars to one.  Good food, but service is lackluster and patrons made to feel uncomfortable. The service that I received tonight was so poor that I will not be returning. First of all, the website states that Ru Ru's does not close until 11pm and upon my arrival at 9pm, guests were still enjoying their meals inside as well as outside. We were seated \"upstairs\". Our sever came by later and orders were placed, though we were never offered chips with salsa or queso dip, which was unusual. The server seemed annoyed and hurried, and never returned to check on us after delivering our food. Roughly 25 min. into our meal, 3 or 4 servers came out to do side work next to us and worst of all one started sweeping the floors where we were sitting! The employee was not sweeping spilled food as that would be appreciated. Instead, she was clearly sweeping simply as part of her closing duties because the manager came by to inspect her work. No paying customer who is eating should have to be surrounded by things like this. I asked a random server (not ours since she was no where to be found) what time the restaurant closed since it appeared that we were in the middle of them getting ready to go home; although there was more than an hour to go before reaching 11pm. I was informed that the kitchen closes at 10pm and the bar closes at 11pm. Well, the kitchen area must be the entire interior of the restaurant because when I looked through the window to the left of our booth, I saw several other employees doing the same side work and some were even eating! I have worked in fine dining before and one of the most important rules that often gets repeated is that no employee is to eat in front of or around guests out of an effort to remain professional. I was shocked that the manager, who was present, allowed for this. Once the waitress returned, she asked my partner if he would like more tortillas, mind you his plate was clearly empty by now so she obviously just proved she wasn't paying attention to us at any given time. I asked for a to go plate for my food and upon her return I asked her why the hostess did not tell us the hours of the kitchen as it caused us to become disturbed by the work happening around us, and had we been made aware of this we would have chosen to eat outside. The waitress only gave a bogus apology so I went on to politely tell her that we had never received such subpar service and couldn't grasp any reason for animosity. She took offense and stormed off to prepare our check. As she returned she quipped \"next time feel free to sit outside anytime\".  After we left I followed up with the manager by phone to inform him of the horrible experience and his lack of concern was immediately evident as he already knew of the situation. As one would expect, he stood up for his employee as any good boss would, but unfortunately he took things too far by making excuses for others and then blaming the experience on my partner and I by stating we chose to sit in that particular area. Though it is True that we chose a booth, we are not responsible for being ignored by our server and only he is responsible for the professionalism of his employees, not I. He was equally as rude as our waitress in regards to our concerns of sweeping and said \"well no one was sweeping dirt into your food so I don't see the problem.\" He then switched gears and wished us to return as he would do anything he could to make up for our experience. I don't care to receive free food or a discount so I will not be positioned to ask for such and should I be offered anything of the sort, I would decline. My partner and I don't seek that sort of thing as we are happy to pay full price for good, quality service and the only reason I reached out to the manager is to speak to someone who would take our concerns seriously and offer a sincere apology, unlike our waitress; but like her he failed to do so and only offered sarcasm. He became upset when I told him I would be writhing a review about my experience, even though my intent is not to be malicious, he took it as such. Sincere, quality customer service is not difficult to achieve and that's what it takes to get repeated business.",

    "text": "Honestly, it was okay. We ordered drinks at the bar while we waited for our table outside and decided on chips and queso while killing time. As expected after reading the article in Charlotte agenda, the chips are absolutely not fresh fried in house. The queso did come out quickly, so not a total con, but not impressed thus far. We all ordered tacos and enjoyed said tacos very much. Nothing to write home about... Maybe upscale food truck tacos. My girlfriend's side salad was brown and in her words \"a day old salad.\" The service was average at best. In fact, my water glass was cleared before we left the table. The ambiance outdoors was wonderful and it would be a great place for drinks after work if you like the SP scene, but don't make a special trip.",

THEN, with the same hand, pick up some peppers and garnishe the cheese. I got my food, and just like the previous time, it was cold. I sent it back and it was even colder the next time.  It's very unfortunate because it's a great atmosphere. I will say that the manager and server both times were very nice.",

    "text": "Yeesh  I was so hoping this place would be better, but was disappointed. My husband and I took advantage of the beautiful Spring evening and sat on the patio. The atmosphere was very pleasant, but I give Mother Nature credit for most of that. We ordered queso to start with, about the same time as the table next to us. They had theirs within 5 minutes. Meanwhile, a solid 20 minutes passed before we ever saw our server again and she finally went to go check on it. The queso was just ok. We ordered 4 tacos to share - lamb, steak, Korean and pork belly. Again, I found them to be just ok. In general, everything was on the bland side - even the Long Duck Dong (Korean style) taco. Not a lot of flavor definition. Hubby wanted to give their tres leches a shot. I find that to be hit or miss at even the best restaurants, and you guessed it... it was just ok. We finally got the check and our server once again disappeared for what seemed like forever. She returned and apologized because she lost our card for awhile and was frantically searching for it.  Luckily she found it!   Two stars for nice patio atmosphere and overall ok food. But wow, the service/kitchen needs a LOT of work. I would go back if a group of people wanted to meet up... but we won't go out of our way for another date night.",

    "text": "Ruru Tacos are very bland, anticlimactic, and just flat out boring. Here's the breakdown:  Taco #1: I asked for a carnitas taco, and there was a layer of chicken on the bottom and pork on top. Who does that?  Taco #2: The Fried chicken taco was beyond over fried, dry and the chicken pieces were obnoxiously small. It was almost as if they cleaned the bottom of the frier and gave me those pieces.  Taco#3: I'm never one to order a steak taco, so I don't want to judge too harshly here. Nevertheless, it would have been nice not to take 1 bite and not have any steak left for the rest of the taco. The whole Korean steak idea was good, but that doesn't mean you can skimp on not seasoning your meat.   All in all, This menu needs to step it's game up. Fall back on the slaw usage on the tacos as well - this shouldn't be the main way to spruce up poorly seasoned meat. One quick tip: if you're calling it guac, actually mix the ingredients together and BREAK DOWN the avocado so it's not technically \"avocado with a side of chopped veggies\" Also, not to mention that I don't know why a taco place doesn't even have the option for rice and beans.   Lastly, I'm no taco snob/expert, but a side of rice and beans should be a dead given to have on the menu. I was fairly disappointed in this place but I'm sure my business will be given elsewhere.

    "text": "This place has great potential for fun times with a huge outdoor patio and bar. I'm already visualizing the Cinco de Mayo party. The outdoor fire  was lit up on this chilly night and as you walk in, you're greeted by the friendly staff and welcoming patio. The indoor bar area was designed very well, with high tables, low tables and a long bar running the length of the room. The restaurant has a comfortable setting throughout. The music was hit or miss...for a tequila restaurant and bar, I would expect something more upbeat than the Righteous Bros. I think they are still working out the kinks on music but I'd go with your traditional Mexican theme. We don't really need another Chuys. What I mean is...there is room for a legit Mexican restaurant in town so own it. Your space lends itself to the title. The queso and guacamole were crowd pleasers. Chips and salsa were not free. I'm from California and never have I visited a Mexican restaurant that doesn't provide free chips and salsa. Considering your $10 micro-margaritas, I think it's something you might consider. We ordered it anyway and it was average (marinara tasting) but extremely fresh tasting. In fact, everything here seemed fresh and made with care. I would go with the queso before the salsa. The chips were impressive and unique. The margaritas were delicious (legit with lime juice and tequila) but also very small (dusted in a few slurps). There was more ice in the glass than liquid. I think the idea was to let the ice melt but I was too thirsty and the 3-4 ounces were gone quick. Kudos for having local beers on taps. The tacos were in flour tortillas and served street style. Between the 4 of us, I think we tried all of them. I loved the grilled chicken but will pass on the carnitas next time. My chicken taco was hearty but the carnitas taco was quite skimpy and the biggest chunk, a piece of fat. Others confirmed the grilled chicken was good. I didn't hear any comments (good or bad) about the mahi or steak tacos on the other side of the table. The white bean side was interesting. I'm not sure if I would go that route again but I'm glad I tried it. Huge tip: Park around the back of the building. Traveling on Providence towards Uptown, pass The Villa and make your first right. Then take your second right into the clearly marked, The Villa Parking Lot. The entrance to RuRu's is actually in back so it's a win-win. Don't park in front - limited spaces and you'll have to walk around anyway. A large parking lot was a huge plus. Lastly, service was prompt and friendly. The new employees seem happy but it was also apparent that the names of the dishes (all movie lines such as my favorite \"Fat Guy in a Little Coat\", was a confusing way to name dishes versus calling it, Grilled Chicken Taco. It was fun though. This is a happy addition to Charlotte and I hope they continue to improve on a great foundation. I cannot stress enough how awesome the design of the restaurant and bar are. We also liked the street style taco and small portions for good value. Even with my few not so favorable comments, it's well deserving of 4 stars after two days of being open. I'm sure it will get better and better with time. And, if you want us to buy tequila, then we want to hear some lively music at the risk of changing your Hollywood, eclectic Pandora station.",

    "text": "So disappointed. We met a couple of friends here tonight for dinner. The drink specials were good and the service was good but I can't say the same for the food I ordered. Add this to the long list of overpriced restaurants in the area... I got mahi tacos and fried oyster tacos with a side of white beans. Maybe they are stingy with seafood because it's more expensive than chicken but I might as well have ordered 2 tortillas with nothing but lettuce and sauce in them because that's basically what I got. There might have been an ounce of fish in each taco and that's probably me being generous when I say that. The oyster taco had two small fried oysters in it and the mahi taco had a very thin 2-inch strip of fish in it. The rest was the shell, lettuce and sauce. I was actually able to fold my taco in on both sides with no spillage. Totally not worth the $4.25 a piece we paid for them. And my side of white beans was pitifully small as well. Our friend ordered a burrito and it was huge but it appeared to be full of mostly rice. My husband looked at me and said \"next time we come here you should get a burrito\". I said \"I'm never eating here again\" and he agreed. His bend & snap salad was embarrassing too. Hardly a salad at all. It left him wanting more. We worked in the food service industry for many years so we understand plate presentation but when a nice looking plate results in hardly any substance (i.e. FOOD) then it's not worth it. We paid way too much for what little bit of food we ate tonight. This is also the only Mexican themed restaurant I've ever been to that makes you pay for chips and salsa. It's normally a free app at every table and even when it's not, I've never seen a $5 price tag for chips and salsa! Take a lesson from Cabo fish taco guys... I go there and I get FREE chips and salsa, amazing tacos and they're stuffed to the max with meat, so much so that it spills out of the taco when I pick it up. And they aren't as expensive either. Don't be stingy with your customers if you want them to return to your establishment. This is America. Most of us like hearty meals.",

    "text": "You really want this place to be good. You just know you're going to like it. The atmosphere is outstanding, tucked away in a convenient location in Myers Park, 10 minutes from home.Tacos, everyone loves Tacos. A great looking place with a great looking crowd. Unfortunately the food is mediocre and the service is non existant. Queso with Chorizo is one of my favorites, their's is so runny it drips all over the table when you try to eat it. Wrong Oyster tacos had two oysters....OK. All four in my party agreed their food was kind of boring. And the service is sort of a sweaty overworked crowd that is so disorganized you want to volunteer to help. Lot of missing in action and oh I forgots.  But the place looks just great. You really want to like it because its a great concept in a wonderful location. It wasn't expensive less than $100 for four with drinks. I expected to pay twice that for such a cool looking place, but then I expected it to live up to the hype. I would rather pay double some where else. Friends said it was overrated, listen to your friends.",

    "text": "The seating outside is lovely.  It is so rare to find a pretty secluded place to sit outside in main Charlotte area.   This venue is very charming and although the restaurant sits in The Villa on Providence which is a busy road, the outdoor seating is on the back side lending itself to a serene feel.  Neighbors know to enter (walking or driving) off Fenton as parking out front can be challenging at times.  I've been there 3 times and enjoyed ordering a different item every time.   The menu is fun and the food is good.   The spirits from the bar aren't the only ones flowing - apparently the staff doesn't like to work past closing as some mysterious things have happened.   It is a beautiful home with lots of history and they'll tell you all about it if they aren't too busy.  I'm giving the food 3 1/2 stars and the bar a 5.   I'm glad Eastover finally has a good neighborhood haunt, if you'll pardon the pun.",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place just for that fabulous patio.  We tried 4 types of the margaritas and they all tasted off, like the lime juice had turned.  We also had the three amigos.  The queso was the best out of the three by far.  The guacamole didn't have much flavor and the salsa looked so red and fresh but I couldn't get over the one flavor that I believe was cumin.   Just not my favorite, the salsa would have been awesome without it.",
