    "text": "This is an incredible restaurant. I went there with my family for Easter brunch and was so impressed by the food, service, and ambience of the restaurant. We were able to order from both the special Easter brunch menu and their regular lunch menu.   We started with calamari, which is the best I've ever had. The breading on it was not overwhelming and it was perfectly cooked. Half of the table ordered blackened salmon (with linguine) and the other half ordered sea scallops and risotto--both were impeccable. The salmon was well-seasoned and cooked to order, the pasta sauce tasted fresh and homemade. I was especially impressed by the scallops. I have often had overcooked scallops but these were tender and flavorful. The risotto was out of this world. Again, everything so fresh.   The service was wonderful. They were polite, friendly, and accommodating, checked on us, and offered us a rack to put our purses on. They kept our waters full, and our tables clean.  On a side note, I was also very happy with their restrooms. Often, restrooms are neglected or unkempt. On the contrary, this restroom was very clean, stylish, and they had the best quality toilet paper and paper towels to use. They even had Listerine for use as well. It's the attention to detail that makes the difference.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, and will definitely be returning. It made our Easter brunch very special.",

They have a pizza oven behind the bar which kind of sets the ambiance and really simple black and white table clothes. As I sat down our waiter brought me my own personal purse rack so my bag didn't sit on the floor. I've never had that happen before at a restaurant! Such great service. I think our server was Chelsea and she checked on us often and was very friendly. They were prompt with water and bread and it was hot and delicious.  For dinner I ordered the veal Marsala which was perfect! It wasn't breaded which I love and the sauce had beautiful portobello mushrooms in it. As good as that was, I think the angel hair pasta on the side was even better. Just simple marinara and it was delicious! I had a lovely martini and wedge salad before which were also awesome. And we finished with tiramisu. They did the tiramisu right, too!  Definitely worth it. Delicious and superb service!",

It was a very good day to sit in the patio area.  Mo was our waiter.. His customer service was on point. Very tentative. However, the food was ok. I gave them a 3 1/2 stars but rounded up to 4..  I had the 3 course lunch because as usual my eyes is bigger than my stomach...  1st course: Creaser salad. Full size salad. It was very bland..  2nd course: seared fish with mashed potatoes, green beans and some kind of flavor butter with sliced almonds. Again, it was bland and oily.. However, the fish was seared very nicely. Nice crunch to it. I liked it.  3rd course: dessert. I can't remember...  Overall, I would go back. I'm guessing they still need to work out their kinks. I heard the waitress told her customers, they haven't had their grand opening yet!!! So I will definitely be back and try something else.",

Husband and I both got the 12.95 three course lunch special- Caesar salad, grouper panini, and tiramisu; tomato bisque, pesto fusilli, and panna cotta. The food was SPECTACULAR. I'll just speak for my food. The tomato bisque was so creamy but didn't taste like heavy cream. The pesto was rich and the texture of the shrimp was so fresh. The little bits of fresh mozzarella appropriate too. And that custard!! Wow. Just the right amount of seeetness and not heavy. We both have a ton of leftovers from our entrees for dinner. We will definitely be going back. What a pleasant and satisfying dining experience!! Thank you, Luciano's!!",

Something must have changed...management, chef, owner...because this was NOT the same culinary experience that we had before. I ordered the bolognese, and it tasted like canned sauce. It was thick, more tomato sauce than meat or chopped veggies, and coated the pasta like tomato paste. It was nothing at all like an authentic bolognese. My husband had a pizza that arrived half cooked. The dough was literally stark white and doughy. If you are looking for authentic, Italian food, do NOT eat here.",

What a great surprise ! Everything was fantastic --from the beautiful decor to the scrumptious and authentic food! We had a waiter...If you go you must ask for him --Mauro! He was from New York and an experienced waiter is what every one wants but you don't always get...He took all of our orders...16 people ( big group in a side private room --perfect ) with out writing anything down..He remembered everything..he was spot on...he suggested things for the big party..how many apps to get and what was fantastic and what was on the menu for Restaurant week. We had about 5 or 6 people get the Queens Feast menu...and the rest of us ordered off the regular menu. Their cocktail list is fresh and inviting..Mixology at its finest with fresh herbs and fruit. One of the cocktails was a Blueberry Sage infused Martini! Delicious.. another was a Strawberry Basil mash that was so fresh and light! Now on to the food....We started out with light an crispy Calamari: Hand-battered and fried with sauteed bell peppers, aioli and pomodoro sauce. Then My personal favorite: CARPACCIO: Black Angus beef tenderloin, shaved authentic Parmigiano, baby arugula, crispy capers, truffle oil, and aioli--if you have never had a Fried Caper..you have missed out!! Huge platters - Mauro knew exactly how many for us to get for the crowd we had. I could not get past the fantastic appetizers, so that is what I had for my dinner..I had the BURRATA: Fresh mozzarella with a creamy curd center, heirloom cherry tomatoes, balsamic reduction, and grilled country bread. That was my first course. my second and entree was the BONE MARROW AL FORNO : Served with grilled Ciabatta,roasted garlic and sea salt. Outstanding..three large bones and a great side of the roasted garlic. Some of the other entrees, that my family tried were the PUMPKIN GNOCCHI: Duck, mushroom ragu, outstanding, the Chicken under a Brick with Kale and roasted fingerling potatoes. They had an incredible tableside Dover Sole MEUNIERE, the Manager deboned it! The Steak was also wonderful which is different for an Italian place but so tender and succulent. All of the pasta's were wonderful too. Great wine list to go with the Cocktail and the desserts...well let me just say to any good Italian...\"ZEPPOLES\" :Ricotta Cheese Filled Italian Doughnuts with Nutella ..enough said.. Heaven on a plate...I would highly recommend this place...Ask for Mauro....Ciao!",

Our waiter claimed that the owner was a meat wholesaler and he had first crack at quality products. The Chicken Parma is the best I have ever had due to the freshness of the chicken and the preparation.  I do have a problem with this place and several other \"Italian\" restaurants in Charlotte. The ownership group being from Latin America does a great job, but the red sauce here is not a priority for them. I love red sauce at Italian places and their red sauce is not great. Fiamma is also has Argentinian roots and does a bad job with the sauce.  Also what Italian place have you ever heard of that puts sun dried tomatoes on the table in oil for dipping bread?   In summary you will enjoy your meal here, but if you expect red sauce reminiscent of Italy, Boston, New York or Philadelphia.....your not going to get it.",

I have never experienced such generosity at any restaurant I've ever been to. Yes, usually a discount, or a drink is taken off the bill which is what I normally would expect, but 2 salads, my veal parmesan, and his steak were taken off. He also had a complimentary salad to go.

Perfect amount of breading as well as a generous amount of cheese. PHENOMENAL service too ! Bravo :)",

    "text": "Stellar Italian food! I was passing through Charlotte for the night and thank Yelp for helping me pick a top notch Italian restaurant!  I went at 7:30pm on a Friday night. They had no Open Table times left, but I called them at 6pm, and they had seating for two people available. We ended up eating at the bar with comfortable chairs (great back support too).  The entire restaurant had a classy ambiance and high-end design with live music.   They provide complimentary fresh bread and a yummy red dipping sauce.  I ordered their gnocchi and it was FANTASTIC! My all-time favorite gnocchi is at Filomena in Georgetown, and Luciano's gnocchi was extremely comparable, definitely my top 2 favorites now. It was smothered in cheeses and flavors that made me eat the entire plate!  There is some parking nearby, but it was easier to Uber there. You will want to after having their amazing craft cocktails. I had a fresh strawberries and vodka cocktail that was delightful.   For two meals and four drinks, we spent less than $100. It's great with friends or date night! Highly recommend!",

Excellent Italian food...well-made, fresh, tasty with decent-sized portions...not huge, but enough that I didn't have to take home leftovers.  A nice, acoustic guitar player in the corner.  So glad he didn't have it amped.  A lot of restaurants that have music let the players use amplifiers and then you just end up with everyone in the restaurant raising their voices and it gets way too loud, so thank you for letting me talk in a normal voice while listening to nice, live music.  Overall the restaurant is quietly elegant and people are wearing nice clothes and talking quietly amongst themselves and enjoying a wonderful evening with wonderful food and ambience.  Cheers to a restaurant and people that appreciate that dining out in Charlotte doesn't mean being unnervingly loud.",

I feel perfectly comfortable here in Blue Jeans and nice shirt. I normally get the Filet Migon, which I again is one of the better one's I have in Charlotte. The sides of Brussell Sprouts and Fingerling potatoes are good. They have a great desert selection. Our party of 4 had 4 Filet's, and 3 different deserts. All were very good. They also have a good wine selection. You can't go wrong making this a special date night, or taking someone here from our of town that you want to show a good time, without being way too expensive.",

    "text": "Some of the food at this restaurant is decent but the whole experience is not worth the 5 stars many reviewers give it.  I was tempted to give it a 2 star rating but I figured 3 is a good rating for an average restaurant.    The decor of this place is beautiful...a far change from what used to be there before.    My friends and I were seated at a table next to the window. The place was not too busy when we arrived on a Saturday night but it quickly filled up.    The odd thing is that our server explained the dinner specials before even taking our drink order.  I ordered a Chianti which was about average in my book.  I later switched to a dirty martini which the first one came without olives?  Our server said he would go get some but they never arrived.    Maybe this is a new trend but wine glasses are not even filled halfway anymore and they still charge you $8 or more for the wine.  Also here, they charge you for the vodka and add another charge for a martini.  I just thought that was strange.  And $10.00 for a martini with the house vodka.  Ouch.   This place serves bread with a marinara like dipping sauce which was quite tasty.  One of two things today that were worth my money.  I ordered the lasagna and a chopped salad.   The salad came out right away and it was tasty with an Italian vinagrette dressing.  The lasagna looked more like a gourmet casserole with what looked like wide egg noodles instead of lasagna noodles.  It looked appetizing but once I bit into it, there was no flavor...no garlic, no Italian spice flavors.  Shame.  I actually had to smother it with red pepper flakes to give it some flavor.  Service was really hit and miss.  It took forever for the entrees to come out.  It took forever for a second round of drinks.   Overall,  this place is average.  Average food that you can find and the run of the mill Italian place and average service.  Dinner prices are reasonable.  They have a few expensive items like chilean sea bass and a few others but where they get you is with drinks.   The kicker is that my friends and I still do not know why this place has a higher rating than Fiamma on the the other side of Dilworth.  Fiamma is by far better than this.",

Valet - check White tablecloths - check  Extensive wine list - check Pricey entrees - check Flavorful, quality food - ...   I was very underwhelmed with the food, especially considering how high the prices were. I had the gnocchi ($18), wedge salad, and tried the veal osso bucco ($29). Given the high reviews and prices, I expected the food to be better. It was all fine, but we could have gotten a better meal for half the price that I would have been happier with elsewhere.

When we arrived there were several people waiting at the front. We were told they were running late so we would have to wait. We attempted to get a drink at the bar but it was full. Everyone was eating there so it wasn't feasible to squeeze in to order a drink. So we joined the crowd at the front.  At some point the hostess said the manager was offering each of us a drink from the bar which was nice. She later brought flatbread which we passed on because I didn't want to spoil my pasta dinner I was excited about!  Needless to say, after waiting ONE HOUR for our 7:45 RESERVATION, we walked out! Who wants to eat at 9:00?!?! The manager followed us out & said a table was leaving shortly & we would be seated. We declined & kept walking!  I understand restaurants get busy & you can't always get seated on time, but to have to wait an hour or more is RIDICULOUS!! However, we will give them one more try since the food was so delicious! (I wanted to write this review on Open Table, but since Luciano's cancelled our reservation after we left, I cannot.)",

We also had the Caesar salad, rigatoni, and the carbonara pasta-everything was outstanding. Since it was our anniversary they gave us a complimentary dessert and it was sublime.

I'm always nervous when I'm near the city because there's a lot of restaurants where you have to find your own parking, which annoys me.  They have a garage and it's free parking which is great!  I looked at some of the yelp photos before deciding to come here.  I'm a bread lover and I had never seen an Italian restaurant have tomato sauce as their dip, so it almost convinced me to go to the other Italian restaurant that I was considering, and I'm so glad I didn't.  The staff was really great here, extremely friendly and the environment was just as great.  They were great at giving recommendations for food and drinks.  I went on a Wednesday and found out that it was half off bottles night which was very exciting because we wanted a nice bottle of wine.  They brought out the bread and sauce which was soooo good!  It wasn't basic marinara sauce, it was like a great dipping sauce for bread which I didn't expect just looking at it.  She even offered us more bread (I would have asked anyway) which I love when they offer it.  I got the shrimp spaghetti dish which was absolutely amazing.  It was a little spicy but even if you don't like spicy, it wasn't overpowering.  In the end she re-corked our wine for us, which I have never had that offered before, so it was really cool since we couldn't finish it all.  Overall everything was amazing and I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "My new favorite place for Italian when I am uptown or in Dilworth area.  A wonderful addition to this area.  Space much improved for dark and dreary LaPaz caveman space.  From the moment we walked into the new bright, expansive restaurant, we were treated like we were the only patrons there, even though there was a large party of 10 - 12 rigth beside us, our service never waivered.   Our server, Adela, was great - even recommending we share a plate since the portions are quite large.    We opted for a chopped salad with a mild Italian dressing, variety of lettuce crisp with fresh garbonzo  beans and a wedge salad with their house dressing which is similar to ranch.  Both were brought out in chilled plates - huge plus in my book.  It is the little things that were done throughout the evening that made for such an enjoyable dinner.  We noted to Adela that we were not in any hurry and she paced the delivery of the entree accordingly.  We paired the Coco Lasagna (crazy lasagna) with a nice, slightly chilled Italian wine.  I love it when a restaurant serves the red wine at the appropriate temperature - not room temperature at 72 to 74 degrees but more 66 to 68.  It so improves the wine experience.    Getting back to the lasagna - kitchen split the dish before serving to us and HELLO no splitting charge which I have yet to figure out why any establishment would do this.  Same quantity of food, only takes 2 seconds to split and plate on two plates instead of one and they charge for this?  Hubby (aka Bulldawg) loved his lasagna but loves his garlic too and thought maybe dish could have had a little more garlic.  Enter Alexander, stage right.  He asked Bully about his food and he didn't hold back on his need for speed - I mean garlic - next thing we knew Bully's dish disappeared and reappeared a few minutes later with an improved bolognese sauce with Bully's drug of choice - garlic.  We could not get enough of this sauce. I actually thought the second dish they brought to the table was another full portion which was great , totally unexpected and added with my leftovers, we will have another full meal.    This place is a date night, girls nite out, hiding out from the in-laws and pretending you are in Italy kind of place.    Loved every minute we were there and oh yes, free valet parking.  This places does it right!",

    "text": "The beef carpaccio is out of this world. It literally melts in your mouth, no chewing required. I'm a huge fan of carpaccio and Luciano's serves the best I've ever tasted. The salads are great as well. I'm a big fan of the mussels as they are flavorful, succulent and cooked to perfection. Management is superb, having no problems ensuring customer satisfaction. The only con, the Margarita Pizza. Mine didn't have fresh Mozzarella only shredded processed cheese, tomato sauce and a couple basil sprigs. Probably the WORST version of a Margarita Pizza I've ever had. However who cares the menu is full of other delicious options.",

I felt better when I noticed they were showing football and there were people wearing jerseys and whatnot. The food was amazing especially the bread which I'm almost positive they bake in their brick oven. The service was also incredible - our glasses were never empty and as soon as our food hit the table there was a server right there to offer is fresh grated parmesan or black pepper. I was only in town for 1 night for a concert in Charlotte but would definitely come back if I happen to be in the area!",

    "text": "We were in town for Turkey weekend, which means we needed a restaurant that could hold a crowd.  We came here for dinner on Saturday night with a total of 11 of us, including 2 very well behaved children (not even being sarcastic - it's just True).  We had a great time, and the restaurant itself was lovely!  It's very bright and even though it's loud, it's not deafening.  Everything everyone had was really good.  My hubby and I shared a wedge salad, but there were also a couple of Caesar salads and chopped salads at the table along with the soup of the day.  Our salad was super crisp and really good!  The Caesar salad was also delicious from the bite I tried!  For mains, I had the linguine carbonara and my hubs had the prosciutto pizza, and we split the two.  Both were really good!  The carbonara was a little creamier than I usually like, but it was seriously still so good!  For dessert I shared the brownie with my nephew.  FYI for anyone on a diet, you should always share dessert with a 6 year growing boy!  I seriously only got a couple bites in before he had ate it all, but it was also really good from what I tasted!   I would definitely come back here again next time I'm in town.",

Customer service was amazing, and they got our checks right on the first try (something that seems to rarely happen when eating out with a large group that is paying separately). I love the ambiance of the place and am interested in trying their dinner menu. My only complaint is the price, prices are a bit high for lunch (they seem more like dinner prices in my opinion)... the price will likely keep me from coming back too often, but I will definitely keep it in the dinner repertoire!",

The bread and sun dried tomato sauce was excellent! The whole table raved. They had a lovely NYE menu, but most of us ordered off the normal menu. I got the lasagne, which was amazing, with a wedge salad. The boyfriend got gnocchi. It was very rich, so the portion wasn't as big, but it was AMAZING. Eggplant parm, chicken parm, lamb chops, roasted chicken, and chicken piccata --all thumbs up from our group. The server was pleasant and helpful. All of our orders were correct and there were no glitches with appetizers coming before salads or not coming at all. A great band was playing, soft appropriate dinner music. We all LOVED this place and will definitely be back. Better pull out my fat jeans because this place is a new favorite.",

Our biggest complaint with the place is our server.  We were quickly seated and our waiter introduced himself and asked for the drink order..he took the hubby's and the kids, my parents and I were still deciding and he said he would be back.  He came back after a little while and asked if we were ready to order. He took our appetizer order and then left.. He didn't ask for our drink order.  He came back again and asked if we were ready to order..again not asking for our drink order. We were feeling rushed to order our dinner, even though the place wasn't crowded.  I finally said - you haven't even taken our drink order. \"Oh, I didn't know you wanted anything\"...If he thought we weren't drinking, maybe that's why for every dish we asked about he suggested adding something to it.  My husband asked how was the ravioli, he said \" it's light meal and I would suggest adding chicken to it\".. My husband said, \"we are Italian and don't put chicken on ravioli.  Never in my life have I heard that suggestion\".  We had a good meal but the service left a bad taste in our mouth.  We will try it again, but will request a different waiter.  Update:  We received a call from Luciano management apologizing for the waiters behavior and informing us that he had been let go.  They must have had complaints before. They sent us a gift card to come back and try them again.  We liked the food so we will be back to try it again.",

    "text": "We are irregular regulars at this local neighborhood eatery. The food is always satisfactory to good, sometimes exceptional. We tend to drop in and sit at the bar, buy a bottle of wine and share a meal. Sometimes we invite friends and bring anywhere from 2 to 12 people with us. Last night we stopped in and seated ourselves at the bar on 1/2 price wine night. We ordered a $27.50 at half price bottle of wine, one eggplant appetizer, one primavera risotto with 4 shrimp entree, one slice of cheesecake. When we were ready to pay, our bill for sharing an average meal with half price wine was $100.00. This seems extreme to us for what we were served. When we left, we looked at our bill again, and saw we were charged $34.00 for shrimp primavera with 4 shrimp on it. The bartender who knows us might have seen it necessary to let us know the price of this meal. Needless to say, we will not be returning to Luciano's. We can head out on a week night in our neighborhood and find wine and a shared dinner for half that price. Thank you but no thank you.",

Now my bf has Italian godparents that he lived with for almost 5 years so he knows real Italian cuisine. This was the farthest thing from that. I had the fettucini alfredo and wedge salad and my bf had the spaghetti and meatballs. It was worse than those Banquet or Marie Calendar frozen dinners. Yes, it was that bad. The \"meatballs\" were 80% breading or whatever and not much meat at all. The flavors of the sauces were basically nonexistent. It was just reallllly bad. I'm assuming their food doesn't travel well, but as terrible as it was I can't blame it all on the fact that it was take out. Should have just gone to Vapiano.",

The noodles tasted as authentic as ones I've had in Rome and the sauce had a nice heat to it without being over powering. Even the shrimp was perfectly cooked and didn't have a \"fishy\" taste in the slightest. Our waitress was very patient, we are question people, and knowledgeable. We also ended up sitting directly next to the owner and his friends and it was very neat to hear them having conversations in all Italian and copying what they ordered because we knew it would be great.

    "text": "Torn between 3 & 4 stars... truthfully the entire experience is more a 3.5 stars.  I have read mostly great reviews on this place, and finally decided to give it a try yesterday (Sunday) late lunch/brunch. I made a RSVP on OpenTable (not because it's needed, since it was 2:30pm and virtually empty) which rewarded 100 points (if that's your thing).   1st impression: nice interior, very romantic chic with the white on white & dark wood floors look.  We're sat immediately at a 4-top. Nice touch on the black napkin (all restaurants should use black napkins in my opinion). On Sundays they have the regular lunch menu and the brunch menu. My eyes went straight to the pan seared sea scallops with risotto ($16).  Waiter came and greeted us. While he was very efficient and did a good job in general, he's a little \"rough on the edges\" for this place. Example 1: I asked for water. He walked away and 3 steps later he turned around and loudly asked \"you want lemon?\" I don't need lemon for my water, but he could have easily brought over water and provide a small dish of lemon wedges if he wasn't sure. It beats yelling back at me 3 big steps away. Example 2: I inquired about the portion of the sea scallops. He didn't know. But instead of saying \"I'm sorry ma'am, I don't know but let me find out\" and actually go and find out, waiter looked at me and said \"well, I don't know, I don't normally do brunch shift.\" And by \"let me go find out,\" he meant walked 4 steps over toward the hostess station and loudly asked the waiter that's standing across the half wall. Eventually he walked to the kitchen. Well, why didn't he just do that to begin with?   Reality is the acoustics in this restaurant is amazingly loud. While there're only 2 other tables and a few patrons by the bar, it seems awfully ear piercing. I don't want to know how loud it can get when there's a full house.  My scallop dish came with 3 large sea scallops cooked perfectly in texture (as in a little rare in the middle) but I think the char on the cooking pan wasn't cleaned out first, because it had a slight burnt taste to it. The risotto tasted good but a little undercooked for my liking. But the portion was good, and it made great leftovers. For the price I think it's a great deal.  The pizza are $12 and was ok in size. Thin crust may be a better way to go ($11 instead) because the crust was a little on the doughy side.  All in all I think the place has good potential. The side dining room can make a great private dining area. The ambience was good if not a little on the loud side. I probably will stick with the lunch/brunch visit for value reason. I will definitely want to try the seafood soup next time.  Decor 4 Food 3.5 Service 3 Value 4 (for brunch/lunch)",

He was very attentive, knowledgeable, patient and full of good energy. He took my order, double checked on ingredients, and handled this dining experience with extra loving care. And even with a couple of food mishaps, he never missed a beat with service and a helpful attitude. I ordered the eggplant parma and it was flavorful and delish. My only issue, was the portion. I'm use to hearty portions at Italian spots so I had to order double the capellini pomodoro to get full. Overall, this one is a winner! Glad they have locations in Atlanta as well :)",

    "text": "Everything we had today was super tasty except for our entrees. We had 3 appetizers: crab cakes (wooooaahhhhh...yes yes yes), calamari (fresh and crispy), and mussels (plentiful). Our entrees were not so great however. My boyfriend had the linguine carbonara with blackened chicken. The best part was the chicken in my opinion but nothing to rave about... Especially after reading the other reviews. I ordered the ravioli al forno stuffed with mushrooms and baked in an Alfredo sauce. I ate half and the rest is currently on it's way to my trash can. The middle was cooked perfectly. however, when you get to the outside, it was a little too tough for my liking. Also, I expected a better Alfredo or recommend creating a better sauce for the ravioli....  The desserts though... HOLY COW!!! Dulce de Leche cheesecake and wild berry pan Chetta. They were sooooooo delicious and the best part of the evening. Please please please try these desserts. It'll ruin your life and overwhelm your palate with delicious joy!  Wait staff was great too though",

    "text": "My wife and I went to Luciano's this past weekend for a belated birthday dinner.  I'd never been, but she had on a work outing a while back.  I started with a Goose Island IPA and she got the red sangria.  Bread and a small dish of a tomato spread were promptly delivered to our table.  The bread was warm and crusty and the tomato was bright and flavorful.  We got white wine mussels as our appetizer.  The mussels were tasty but as everyone knows, you don't get the mussels for the mussels.  We got some extra bread to dip into the white wine sauce they came in.  It was absolutely delicious.  At first I thought it was a bit too heavy on the lemon but after my third piece of bread soaked in the stuff, I realized it was necessary to cut the richness of it and it would have tasted a bit too heavy without it.  Both of us got a caesar salad before our mains.  The homemade garlic croutons were excellent.  The dressing coated every piece of lettuce evenly and the shavings of parm on top were perfect.  I also really enjoyed the very coarse grind of the fresh black pepper offered by our server, Omar.  For my entree I got the braised beef agnolotti.  It is one of the best things I've eaten at a restaurant in years.  It came with brown butter, fried sage, and parmiagiano shavings.  The meat inside each one was soft, supple, and delicious.  With this entree you only get five or six agnolotti, so there won't be any leftovers, but it's so rich that you don't need any more than that.  My wife got the chicken fra diavolo.  I was quite impressed at how tender the chicken was, as breast meat can be woefully overcooked in dishes like that.  The herbal complexity of the sauce was also impressive, and the pasta was perfectly al dente.  After all of this we were stuffed but hey, it's my birthday, right?  We got our desserts to go.  I saw a table of bluehairs order the cannoli and it looked so good I had to have it.  My wife got the tiramisu.  Even coming out of the fridge a couple hours later, both of them were excellent.  Service was pretty good, and ambiance was fine.  The food was the absolute star of the show here, and we will certainly be back.",

    "text": "3.5 stars   My boyfriend and I returned to Luciano's for Restaurant Week as our second try. We were seated in the extension area, not the actual main room, despite our reservations. Our server Phillip was nice but not spectacular, I wish he actually brought the bread that he said he would bring back, the comp bread and marinara app was very tasty and fresh. I felt pretty neglected after our appetizers were brought up.  Drinks:  Strawberry Basil- I didn't like this at all, I even struggled to finish it. It was a bit too bland and bubbly for me.   App:  Antipasto Salad: the bf loved this! The balsamic vinaigrette was so on point. It had a little too many olives for my unconditional liking.  Peppers Alla Romana: Very good! Though stuffed with goat cheese, the chorizo and arrabiata sauce toned it down to a great balance. I could have munched on these all night. This was my second favorite dish of the night.   Entree:  Linguini Pescatore: I loved the fact that so much seafood was included in the actual dish and not just on the menu. It was generously garnished with yummy shrimp, clams, oysters, and mini scallops. I'm usually not a fan of white wine sauce, but I did enjoy this dish. I wasn't as overpowering as I expected it to be. However, I do think that the pasta noodles were waaaay overcooked.  Chicken Capricciosa: It was a little dry, I think a little arrabiata sauce would perfect this dish. The lemon risotto was so creamy, I could have eaten a whole bowl. The tomato arugalla salad was delicous and paired well with the Romano encrusted chicken. This was also a very large dish, we came back with left overs.   Dessert:  Banana Bread Pudding: OMG, put the twinkie down and head to Luciano's for this! We loved this! The bread pudding itself was not overly sweet but the caramelized bananas were delicious with the salted caramel. The bf and I have agreed that we would return just to order this. OUR FAVORITE DISH OF THE NIGHT.  Chocolate Mousse Cannoli: also very good. I've never had a cannoli but, Luciano's does it right. It was very fresh and light.   We did enjoy the food here, we will be back. Shout out to Miguel the GM for bringing me back, I appreciated the effort you put in to Luciano's, it has clearly paid off.",

    "text": "For the money, this is the best Italian place in Charlotte that I've been to.  I wouldn't go as far to to say that every dish is outstanding because this is my 3rd or 4th time here and I've had a different Dish each time.  I will rank the the 3 dishes I can remember in order from best to least favorite below:  1.  Chicken Picatta (not sure about the spelling here but this dish is magnificent, the chicken has an amazing creamy taste with the capers contributing to savory finish.  At first I thought the pasta was a little underdone but they serve all pastas al dente, which is traditionally the way it should be prepared.  I grew to appreciate this and I think I will stick with this dish on future visits.)  2.  Spaghetti and Pork Meatballs ( This is not your average spaghetti and meatball dish.  For one thing the meatballs are huge and better than any I've ever had.  The sauce was also a delightful blend of tasty herbs and vegetables which was very tasty beyond anything you could prepare yourself or buy at the store.)  3.  Chicken Fra Diavolo- ( Though this was my least favorite dish it wasn't because the sauce and spices were not delicious.  It was because the chicken in the dish was flavorless and this was very disappointing.)  One last closing remark would be to ABSOLUTELY GET THE CARPACCIO as an appetizer because it the best thing on this entire menu.  It comes out on an enormous plate and for $13 you cannot beat this deal.  I can't even explain it you'll just have to go and taste how good this is in person as any explanation just wouldn't do it justice.  I will be return.",

    "text": "It was a stretch to give 2 stars.  We got reservations for a late Saturday night meal and the place was packed.  Having eaten in the Atlanta Luciano's my expectations were pretty high.  Except for having the same ownership, these 2 restaurants unfortunately are quite different.  Our server was initially very quick to our table, almost as soon as we were seated.  With a larger group, it takes a bit of time to digest the menu and wine list.  And then we waited.  Eventually she showed back up and took our orders.  And then we waited.  About 20 minutes later, wine glasses show up.  But they are not all the same, one glass is for Pinot and the rest are normal Cabernet.  Very odd for an upscale restaurant, I even asked about it when we noticed it.  Was told there were no other clean glasses (and that's after waiting about 20 minutes?).  Another 10 minute wait before our wine shows up.  So we've been here close to a hour already and finally just getting wine.  And then we wait.  OK, so I'm grumpy again (granddaughter in tow) and finally food comes out.  With the bread for the table.  We eat, and then wait.  Only 1 time after receiving the food did anyone come by to see if we needed anything.  We're sitting there, finished, and waiting on our check.  Our server is no where to be found.  Our table is cleared, still no waitress.  Finally our check arrives (well over 2 hours since we arrived!) and you can imagine my disgust to see that a 20% tip was applied to the bill.  I said we were a large group.  5 adults and a 2 year old.  Six people.  20%.  20% on top of wine AND tax.  I'm not one of those to stiff the staff, but I did hand write on the check that the tip was not earned or deserved.  Just be informed.",

There were about 14 of us in the party so we were seated in the private dining area and that worked out so well! We were able to enjoy the evening and feel like we basically had the place to ourselves!   Our waiter was Fernando and he was awesome! He was supper attentive and we always had what we needed and that's no easy task when you have 14 starving ladies! We started off with some sangrias and the bread with marinara. Those sangrias definitely packed a punch. Don't think of your typical sangria mix....kick it up a few notches and you have the Luciano's version. So good!   To start, I ordered the Wedge salad which come topped with tomatoes, bacon, parmigiano dressing, and gorgonzola cheese. It's a classic,  not overdone or too fancy. Add to that the dressing was perfect! I'd definitely recommend. For  my dinner I ordered the Shrimp Fra Diavolo. My goodness. The large shrimp were perfectly cooked and the marinara and brandy combination was so flavorful!   So glad I had the opportunity to give this place a try. The service and food were both excellent and I look forward to my next visit.",

Ronald took great care of us throughout the evening.   They have a sun-dried tomato dipping sauce for the bread. Different and I like it. Started with a bottle of wine and the calamari. We pretty much always get calamari at an Italian restaurant. Theirs is mixed with fried zucchini. Mmm. I love nothing more than taking a healthy green vegetable and deep frying it.   I declined on a salad because I knew we had a lot of food coming, but I kept sneaking bites of my boyfriend's wedge salad. It was so refreshing. I am not a blue cheese person but the dressing was pretty subtle.   I opted for one of the specials- crab and lobster ravioli. It had a tomato cream sauce and was topped with cherry tomatoes and kale. Sauce was a little salty but I loved the kale topping. Really helped balance out the tastes and textures. I would probably stick to the menu offerings next time, ended up being a pricey entree (no surprise as its crab and lobster). Boyfriend got the gnocchi and O.M.G.  Don't think we will will be able to skip this when we come back. Delicious.   Their desserts all looked great, but we were way too stuffed for that. So many other things on the menu I want to go back and try. Plus, 10% off food for checking in with the Yelp app. Love that.",

This lack of consistency brought my rating down.   Otherwise, the space is really nice - has a high-end, modern feel to it. They also offer valet parking, which is nice on busy nights in South End. Its not a huge restaurant, so reservations are recommended. This is a nice spot for celebrations.",

    "text": "I tried out Luciano's thanks to Queen's Feast aka a food lover's favorite time of the year! Reservations were made so it made dining on a Saturday evening a breeze.  We were greeted and immediately seated in the room off of the main dining room. The main dining area is very nice, all black & white decor. Our table of fabulous ladies started off dinner properly with glasses of wine.   To note, if you order a glass of red wine, the wine will be poured into a comically oversized wine glass. My glass of sauvignon blanc appeared in an adequately sized glass.  For appetizer, I ordered the fried zucchini. Forgive me, because I forget the actual Italian name for it. They were delicious!! Thin zucchini patties served with arugula and a side of marinara sauce for dipping. Main entree, I ordered the seafood cannelloni. I wasn't as happy with this dish. It tasted a little too shrimp-y for me. Dessert, I got the chocolate cannoli. It was good but nothing special.  I found the portions to be just right and the meals were spaced out with just enough time in between. A lot of the time with restaurant week menus, the wait staff seems to rush to bring out the dishes with you not being able to fully enjoy each plate. Not at Luciano's, I got to enjoy and eat every bite of my meals.  I was very pleased with my experience and look forward to going back!",

It was watermelon salad, with heirloom tomatoes and feta (which I was able to switch out for Gorgonzola).  I'd like to recommend to the chef and manager at not only this restaurant but others, do not have fruit and vegetables on the menu when they are not in season.  Clearly its not watermelon season at the end of February and beginning of March, because the watermelon was totally tasteless and sour.  Also, I don't know what heirloom tomatoes taste like but I do know what Roma tomatoes taste like and those were totally Roma.  I did enjoy my Martini and the company I had. Great outdoor seating and indoor decor.",

    "text": "I made reservations ahead of time.  Glad I did!  Even though there were three empty (dirty) tables when we arrived at 8:35, we were told to wait. We had a drink at the bar and looked over the menu.  15 minutes later, we were seated.  5 minutes go by, then someone comes by with water and tells us our waiter will be right with us. Guitar player and singer were very talented and a nice added touch!  Then we are given warm sourdough bread with a plate of sun dried tomatoes with olive oil.  Bitter and odd. In all of my years I have never been served anything but Italian bread in Italian restaurants. Bitter sun dried tomatoes with sourdough bread?!  Eventually the bartender comes over, tells us the specials, and takes our order.  Now we're up to 5 dirty tables around us.  Chopped salad comes out. Lettuce, red cabbage, garbanzo beans, vinegrette.  Very bitter and very little creativity.  Eggplant parmegian and chicken parmegian come out with sides of Angel hair pasta.  Large portions!  My chicken was good as was the eggplant.  Sauce on the pasta was also bitter.  Now we're up to 7 dirty tables surrounding us!    We ordered Nutella filled zeppoli for dessert with coffee.  Great ending as dessert was nice and the coffee was excellent.   Lack of busboys  and waitstaff was obvious.  Seven dirty tables at 9:30?!  Not one dish or glass removed the entire time we were there.  I never saw a manager the entire time.  Bill for 2 entrees, a side salad, 3 glasses of wine, dessert, and coffee totaled around $110 including tip.   Valet service was a needed touch as parking tends to be tough since they share a parking lot with another restaurant.  Overall, good food and atmosphere, but lack of service ruined our visit.  No hurry to go back.",

Get over there for lunch or dinner STAT!  I took my best friend here for her \"bachelorette dinner\", but it was just us and one other friend.  The three of us were each treated so well.  We're a lively group and always have something to say, so as we sat down, a waiter asked if \"regular water\" was ok for us.  We asked what would happen if it wasn't, and he grinned and said he could get us spritzer or something else, but that this was \"fine regular water\" so we said, well, that'll be ok.  After that, every time he came by, the water got better and better..  by the end of the evening it was \"fine, refined, italian water specially prepared for our dining pleasure\".  It was cute, but not crazy silly.  We laughed and talked with all our wait staff and everyone was just as friendly and nice.    So, I say all that to illustrate, the training program for this staff must be something very special.  I have rarely had such a fun AND professional dining experience.  The food, however, is the real star here.  Our table tried the Tortellini, the Gorgonzola Steak, and the Chicken Cacciatore.  Every single entree was sublime, the flavors perfectly balanced.  For dessert we shared Tiramisu and Cannolis.  On both dishes, I've never had better!  This restaurant is beautiful, has top notch staff and delicious food.  On Wednesdays they're now doing 1/2 priced bottles of wine, too.  Get by and check this place out.  If you want, tell them the \"girls in the corsets\" sent you.  ;)",

We started with the complimentary bread and what tasted like a sun dried tomato like sauce, and also had the goat cheese pomodoro appetizer. That appetizer is a MUST if you come here, I could have made a meal out of it. I had the linguine carbonara, which may be the best carbonara I have ever had. It was so rich and flavorful, the bacon was cooked perfectly for the sauce and the peas and onions really finished the deal. The sauce was creamy and ugh I could go on and on. I took home a piece of the tiramisu and wow that was fantastic. I mean seriously good!!! This restaurant really knows what it's doing and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic Italian dinner in Charlotte!",

My only complaint was our server, she didn't ruin our experience but she wasn't great.  Ordered a coke, never got it, asked for more bread, that didnt come unril we finished our meals but the one thing that lost the star was she never told us there were specials. I heard her tell the next table over after we ordered. Im a foodie so I like to know all my options and there was a special I definitely may have liked to try.  Regardless we will definitely be back.",

I was surprised with the time and occasion that it wasn't more busy than it was when we walked in, but as we were leaving, the place was packed. I guess they draw a later crowd.   I'll start with the service. Our waitress was very nice and outgoing, slightly forgetful though. Forgot bread, refills, a salad etc. Not a huge deal and her friendliness and her personality made up for it. I will say the wine, for $10 a glass was an under-pour. Obviously not the waitress's fault, just something worth noting.   We started with the antipasti plate and the baked goat cheese dish. Both were good, but for the price of the antipasti plate, it could use some more food and I'd recommend giving a few more pieces of the toasted ciabatta bread. I also had a wedge salad. Can't really go wrong with a wedge but the Parmesan dressing was tasty.   My entree was the gnocchi. This came in an Gorgonzola cream sauce with prosciutto and bread crumbs. Very tasty, not a huge portion though. I also added Italian sausage to this dish. I'd definitely recommend this, it worked well with the dish.   All in all, this restaurant was tasty with friendly service. A bit overpriced for what it is, however.",

I ordered the tomato basil fettuccini... delicious and the perfect serving! The sauce was creamy and complimented the dish so well. My partner ordered the chicken Parmesan. He finished it all and stated that the potion was generous and had no complaints. For dessert, I ordered the strawberry shortcake. It was what heaven must be like. The cake was light and sweet without tasting artificial or dense. It tasted better than a bakery.   Service was spot on and really made my day special. I can't wait to return!",

I opted for the capellini bolognaise and it was a good portion of a rich and meaty sauce, already tossed through. My wife opted for the lamb chops and she enjoyed them. Three good sized and meaty chops in a savory sauce with small potatoes.  Dessert was a chocolate torte that was excellent. Nicely plated and very sweet.  Valet parking available.",

My Seabass was cooked perfectly, the only thing I would change is the way it was placed on top of everything. All the flavors were great but I don't like mixing my food when it sines to a $45 seabass. I want to taste everything separate. Can't believe I didn't take pictures.

They were able to recommend a great wine for us, and it complimented the dinner so well.   We began with the baked goat cheese pomodoro. The bread was delicious and the spicy sauce was the perfect compliment to the goat cheese. They also give you a nice helping of the goat cheese.  The restaurant also provides you with bread and dip, so this was just a nice addition.   We split two entrees recommended by one of the managers. We had the mushroom risotto with scallops and the lasagna coco pazzo or a \"deconstructed lasagna.\" Both portions were very large and very delicious! I think we agreed that we both liked the lasagna better because it was different and the meat sauce was incredible. The scallops were cooked perfectly too though.   Lastly, we finished with Italian Ricotta cheesecake and Creme brulee. She warned us that the Italian Ricotta cheesecake would not be as sweet as a normal cheesecake, but we love ricotta so we went for it. We were very glad we did. It was unique and we enjoyed trying something new. The creme brulee was picture perfect as well. They bring the desserts out on a plate to show you before you order them, which was a nice touch.   The service and hospitality here was incredible. We were treated so well, and I was so grateful for this. Not only is it delicious, the people are so great! We will definitely, definitely be back. Kind people, delicious food, romantic, great location.",

When the server finally came, I asked a question about the menu.  She didn't know the answer and said that she would find out. In the meantime, she went to get the orders from another BIG table of patrons. It took a lot of time to get the answer to my question. In fact, things were so obviously out of whack that I asked the hostess to please send the manager to talk with me.  When the manager came, she was eager to make things right.  She wanted to comp the bill, but that's not what I wanted. I just wanted efficient service. In the end, they took 50% off of the tab and the server apologized.  As far as the food:  the omelet that I got was tasty, but very small.  A few fork fulls and it was all gone.  I eat a lot of omelets and I know what constitutes a reasonable portion.  They served enough for an elf.  I probably should have gotten the blackened chicken salad that came with cranberries and gorgonzola and other good stuff, but I didn't. (Insert the idiom about HINDSIGHT).  I love the space in this restaurant. It makes me feel really comfortable.  There is an elegance about it.  I'd say with more efficient service and a slightly better portion size,  Lucianos could rock the world in a bigger way.  Just the opinion of one.",

Our server sounded Italian and he was so wonderful and made the experience even more authentic.

I've never had anything I didn't like, but their pasta is amazing. Always cooked to perfection. My favorite is the rigatoni, but the gnocchi with Gorgonzola cream is a close second. Definitely the best pasta I've had in the city.",

It was a Saturday night so I understand they may have been busy.  The restaurant was not busy enough  to have an excuse for poor training of staff , food that was below average that took forever and management who obviously did not care.  I highly recommend not visiting this restaurant if you are looking for good service and good food.",

    "text": "We came here on a Monday for dinner. The place was a ghost town- maybe a total of 8 within the entire restaurant. We were greeted, upon seating, by our server who was currently in training (looked to be in high school). I was surprised to not see any senior staff with him throughout the night. It would have been nice to have been walked through the menu as this was our first time here. No biggie- we reviewed the menu ourselves.  We ordered a Wicked Weed beer and a glass of wine, but they ended up being out of the beer we ordered so we just opted for water and a coke. We started our meals with a ceasar and wedge salad (+$4.50 to add to your meal). I got the wedge and it was great. I loved the dressing and the gorgonzola cheese was super tasty. The ceasar salad was served as 'deconstructed', which I'll never understand why they do that anywhere (besides a wedge obviously!), but my husband said it was good. Both salads were large servings for a \"side salad\". We also got bread and a bruschetta style dipping sauce that was tasty.  My husband was in the mood for chicken fettuccini alfredo, but didn't see it on the menu. We asked our server and he said they could make it for him ($22.50). I got the chicken tomato basil pasta ($18). I guess I should of known better, but my pasta was actual 'tomato basil fettuccine'. I thought the sauce (cognac cream sauce) would have tasted like tomato basil. There wasn't much tomato or basil flavor within the dish at all, however it was good- just not what I was expecting. My husband's alfredo was OK, but for $23 we just expected more flavor and creaminess to it.   Overall, not sure if I would be the first to recommend or jump to go back to Luciano's, which is a disappointment because we were really looking forward to it. Maybe it was because we went on a Monday and it was so quiet and awkward in the place, or because we ordered the wrong thing- but we didn't have much guidance. I know I'm a Yelper and should do my research before going into restaurants, but I also expect a higher level of service from nicer, established places in Charlotte.",

I'm still giving the experience 4-stars as the decor was good and the service was excellent. It is a bit odd having NFL on television in an establishment with chandeliers - odd.",

The ambiance is lovely and on Friday nights, they have live music. Romantic for a date night but also great for a group. The sun dried tomato tapenade they serve with the bread is incredible!   Being a vegetarian, they happily altered the gnocchi dish to suit my dietary needs. My husband had the chicken parmesean and loved it.   The pear margarita was delicious!

First of all the waiter tried hard to sell us on everything, from the specialty drinks to dessert and coffee. This is great, except whenever the answer was no, he seemed upset and made a \"joking\" comment. It was very odd. Service was also very slow which I didn't understand because there wasn't much of a crowd there. It took about 10 minutes just to get more bread.   As for the food - it was average for an Italian restaurant, so in my opinion, not worth the price. I had eggplant parm which was totally overcooked. The eggplant was pretty much mush, but the taste of the cheese and sauce was good. Oh I also had a chopped salad that would have been good but it was way over dressed.   The general consensus around the table was that the food was good. But no one raved about it.  I might return to try some appetizers because they looked pretty tasty. But I definitely won't be back for a full meal.   Oh they also had an extensive wine list for the wine lovers out there. If thats something you would enjoy that would be a plus.",

    "text": "Excellent but very rich foods, prices are moderate all things considered, watch out for that waist line.   FWIW there's a $13 lunch deal . Today it was tomato basil w/italian sausage bisque or salad, then salmon, swordfish or spicy pasta and desert. I think considering the quality it's a bargain.   We decided to order a la carte instead but I thought I should help get the word out there. This is what we ate instead.  They first bring out a complimentary dip with a basket of Italian country bread. The REAL thing, not the pretty looking but crap tasting imitations that all supermarkets sell, the bread, the bread ...   5 stars  I didn't care one bit for the dip, although my S.O. liked it just fine. It's some red pesto heavy with sun dried tomatoes, too heavy for my taste I'd rather dip in the traditional olive oil with balsamic and herbs or pepper - No rating  Mussels in white wine ($8)  A surprisingly large serving for the price and the sauce was excellent, good enough to dunk and even slurp a couple of spoonfuls but richer with butter than it needs to be.  The quality of the mussels themselves was just so-so. Some were gritty, there were shards of broken shells, some had failed to open. 3 1/2 stars  Scallops and artichoke linguini w/pancetta in garlic butter ($16)  Three huge and sweet scallops, tasty artichoke and al dente linguini, altogether a really nice dish. The thing is I personally tired of  pasta in cream sauces years ago and this sauce left the pasta a bit gooey and tasted more like a light cream sauce than just butter and garlic.  3 1/2 stars  Zuppa di Mare ($24) not a soup. Catch of the day w/mussels, clams, squid, shrimp and scallops in tomato broth with garlic bread. I just spooned the plate dry of the broth, I'd give 5 stars for the garlic bread and the broth alone it was delicious bar none... but the seafood itself?   The catch of the day was salmon, which I think not the best choice for this zuppa, and there was tons and tons of it, more than I wanted with one big scallop, two small shrimps and a tiny bit of shellfish. Not what I had in mind, for the record this is a dish I often order when it's in the menu. (5+3) /2 = 4 stars so close yet so far...  The decor is borderline kitschy what with all those columns but the designer put it together really well, the nearly monochromatic dining room is sober, elegant and cozy at the same time .... and the service couldn't be better.",

    "text": "I wanted to eat Italian in Charlotte and. Jose Luciano's because it had such good reviews on Yelp.  Well it deserves the good reviews it's fantastic.  Our server Louise was informative, attentive and recommended well.  The scallop special was great, the fish with Tuscan beans was tremendous but the grilled Octopus appetizer was the star of the show.   Tender and served on the tastiest chick peas. Since it was Wednesday night bottles of wines were half price.  I had a delicious Malbec and was able to take some home.  Overall just about the beat Italian experience to be had in Charlotte.",

    "text": "I work upstairs and they stay open late for lunch, so I decided this place was perfect for me for lunch the other day.  I sat outside so can't comment much on the decor inside, though definitely a huge change from the La Paz days.  Service from hostess to server to busser to food runner was all very nice.  The bread is excellent, I think it was my favorite part of the meal!  It was so warm and fresh, a nice crustiness to it.  Its served with a sun dried tomato spread and I actually liked it, not being a huge SDT fan.  I got a salad and a pizza for lunch.  Here is where I am annoyed.  I asked is that too much food, the server assures me not at all.  Lie!!  The salad was entree size and I ate less than half.  Look I get that it pads his check, but I respect you more for your honesty and that's what makes me a repeat customer.  The salad wasn't great though, it was a chopped salad and it was drowned it dressing and some of the lettuce was sad and limp.  And not really chopped, I expected smaller pieces for a chopped salad, but that's me being nit picky I guess.  My entree was the vegetarian pizza.  I was excited for this.  And then I was pissed.  They covered it in red pepper flakes.  I didn't request this, it wasn't on the menu and I have 0 tolerance for spicy food.  So I sat there trying to pick the pieces out while my lips and mouth burned and I seethed.  I of course said nothing because it was already getting late and my hour for lunch was quickly ending so I just took it as a lesson learned, next time I will explicitly tell them to not add anything other than that which is stated on the menu!  I gave 3 stars because I am not ready to write them off yet.  They are convenient for me for lunch so I want them to succeed.  But maybe a little more time to get all the kinks worked out before I try again.",

    "text": "From what I was told, Luciano's had been open for only a week or two when I ate here in early May. The ambiance was somewhere between casual and upscale, with lighting that was dim enough for a comfortable dinner and nice ambient lighting around the ceiling. I was with a party with mixed attire -- some jeans, some shirts and ties, the women in skirts and blouses -- and no one seemed to have a problem with it. There's a lovely patio, but I don't care for eating outside so I'd be unlikely to sit there.  I would go to Luciano's just for the strawberry panna cotta alone. This was my first time ever eating panna cotta and it was a life-changing moment for a girl who loves her sweets. In all honesty, two of those stars are for the dessert, one and a half are for the meal, and one and a half are for the service and atmosphere.  As for the meal itself, I had a luscious black spaghetti with bay scallops, shrimp, and mussels; the menu online indicates that it's black linguine but I suppose they might have changed that since the menu was created. The peppery tomato sauce was gorgeous. My husband had salmon oreganata, which I got to taste and I enjoyed it. As a bread lover, I had to make myself stop eating the complimentary bread and sundried tomato spread that the server brought out before the meal. My friend ordered goat cheese pomodoro to share and I could gladly make a meal of that. The food was all tasty and worth the price.   Service was attentive and welcoming, including a visit to our table from the manager. All of the staff did their jobs well and with pride.  On a small side note, I appreciated that the ladies' room had a bottle of mouthwash and little cups on a side table. We were going out after the meal and I didn't want my breath to smell of garlic. Maybe I just don't go to enough classy joints to have encountered this before, but I liked it.  Luciano's will definitely be on my list of good places to go for Italian food.",

    "text": "What a beautiful transformation to this former La Paz! I've been here twice in three weeks!   Upon entering, we were greeted immediately and friendly. The team of service staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and truly exceptional.   Their complementary warm crusty bread with sundries tomato is wonderful.  I had the Mussels Bianco for an appetizer on my first visit, it's so delicious, that I insisted having it again for my second. The sauce is so good we asked for more bread to dip into it!  The first visit, I had trouble deciding between the Gnocchi and the Ravioli Al Forno. I chose the Gnocchi. I was simply wonderful, tender and flavorful. I forced myself to stop eating it so I would have leftovers. My friend enjoyed the Eggplant Parmigiana .   For my second visit, I knew I was having the Ravioli and was not disappointed at all! I liked it as much if not better than the Gnocchi! Again, my friends also enjoyed their meals, one had a pasta dish, although I don't know which one, and as last time, the Eggplant Parmigiana was a hit.   This time we had desert, Peach Cobbler and Tiramisu. Both were enjoyable.   The red wine was slightly chilled which is a plus and I enjoyed the Menabrea Amber beer.  The prices and portions are great.    We decided that we will just work our way down the menu since everything is top notch!   I can't wait to share this great restaurant with more friends!",

    "text": "After seeing the previous reviews, I was very anxious to visit Luciano's. Upon arrival, the restaurant has been truly renovated since the La Paz ownership & is beautiful. We sat outside and enjoyed the bread and sun dried tomato dipping sauce with proseco, which was very good. We decided to start with the octopus appetizer, which was undercooked, chewy and overall not something I would enjoy again. We explained the issue to the waiter and shortly after our waiter and the manager approached the table to apologize. The chef tasted it & realized it was very undercooked and threw that batch away. A few minutes later they brought a complimentary calamari, very nice, but that was just as undercooked as the octopus.  On to the entrees...we ordered the chicken piccata & the gnocchi. The chicken was ok, however, the entire plate was oil, and I mean dripping! As for the gnocchi, another uncooked meal. They were doughy and mush. I hate to write this, because I did expect better, but for now I will stick with a few other Italian restaurants that are much better, and maybe give them another shot after a few more months in business.",

I agree that the bread and tomato oil was lovely - a pleasant surprise.  We both ordered the Mista Salad.  I would have preferred to see more pine nuts and tomatoes.  It mostly greens.  The Prosciutto Pizza was scrumptious - the amount of prosciutto was amazing - heaps!  We then split the Rigatoni Salsiccia but subsitited a non-spicy sauce.  It was loaded with mozzarella, peppers and sausage.  I really enjoyed it.  No room for dessert!!!!!!!!!!  Our waiter seemed to be a little out of it - he had to read the specials from his notes, asked us to repeat our orders a couple of times and then disappeared when we tried to get the check.  When I ordered a glass of the Quattro Mani.  He asked which one.  I had specifically checked that there was only one Quattro Mani.    I would definitely go back!",

The Cesar's salad was excellent - fresh crisp, lighted dressed and served on a chilled plate. Good start! However, the main course was a pasta dish that was inedible. And could I even find a waiter or bus boy to bring me salt & pepper? No. Finally the manager realized I wasn't eating and no one was around, so she asked me about the food, and quickly offered to bring me something else. That was classy. (Just for reference - I don't think I've EVER sent back a meal at a fine dining restaurant. I'm not that type of picky patron, but I just couldn't swallow this dish.) Unfortunately, even after the second main course arrived, I couldn't get my waitress' attention to get the check for what seemed like days. Between the dreadful pasta and the poor service, I doubt I'll ever be back in spite of the fact that I give the Manager kudos for handling a difficult situation gracefully.",

When the manager asked if I wanted it wrapped up and I told him I did not care for it, he offered nothing for my disappointment, inspite of the fact that I was picking up the bill for the table. So unless you are looking for tasteless chunks of eggplant with sauce and cheese on top, don't order the eggplant parm. Their inconsistency makes it too risky to want to go back.",

    "text": "Last night my kid asked for Italian for dinner and since we were uptown I quickly scrolled through Yelp and found Luciano was just around the corner in South End. At 6 pm the restaurant was close to empty. We asked to sit outside (big mistake-the traffic was loud and it was hot) and we're informed that they offered a Queen's Feast menu. The Queen's Feast features an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $35. We opted for the QF menu since it typically serves as a sampling of what a restaurant has to offer and should include some of their best and most popular dishes. We chose the grilled asparagus appetizer, bruschetta appetizer, filet mignon w/whipped sweet potatoes + sauteed spinach, lobster ravioli, and the strawberry shortcake + coconut panna cotta.   So here's the rundown: Appetizers: were great, they were flavorful and had a unique spin.   Entrees: The entrees were lackluster. The ravioli tasted like ocean water that's all we could taste. The filling was almost pureed and did not resemble the normal taste nor texture of ravioli. The sauce that accompanied the ravioli was gelatinous and also tasted like ocean water. It was very disappointing. The filet mignon was perfectly cooked but some also lacked flavor...some cracked black pepper would have done it some justice. The sweet potatoes tasted like cream...some may like that but I prefer my sweet potatoes to taste like sweet potatoes.   Desserts: The desserts were the saving grace of our meal. The panna cotta was perfect and I loved the toasted coconut on top. The strawberry shortcake was equally delicious and the texture was airy and moist.   Overall the experience was so-so. Service was extremely slow. After the appetizers, my kids received their meals (spaghetti and pizza), we were informed by our waiter that our main courses would be out in 3-5 minutes. Almost 20 minutes later, our main courses arrived and as mentioned above our main courses were very disappointing. On the positive note: the kids meals were generous portions and my kids enjoyed them. I also liked the price point for the kids selections but I doubt we'll be back.",

When we sat, we were offered french bread with a tomato dipping sauce. The food was good but didn't really blow my socks off - but is probably because I went with a common dish. Next time, I will order a seafood dish I think.  The restaurant is very nice inside decor wise and is a great place to come for a work dinner. I did also really like that the restaurant offered mouthwash in the restroom so you don't have to go home with garlic breath! The table service was also great.   I enjoyed my dining experience here, but parking was so confusing. There was a valet person, but I think he might have been there for a salon, and many parking spots were blocked with cones. I parked in a packing garage next to the restaurant.   I would come here again for a work dinner, but the dining experience or food isn't a place I would come back for a date night.",

The food was tasty and on the pricey side but still reasonable enough. My husband ordered a pasta dish with shrimp and the tails were still on. I understand some of the reason behind this but it's annoying to de-tail shrimp covered in sauce. He also ordered the chicken but got shrimp. No big deal but just not what he ordered. He liked it so we didn't send it back.   The dessert was a bit of a joke though. We work in the industry and recognized our dessert from the frozen section of Sysco's dessert menu the second be bit into it. It wouldn't matter as much if they didn't charge us $9.00 for it.  Their accommodations in the bathrooms were a nice touch, mouth wash and quality soap and towels. It's a funny thing to enjoy but it does add that luxury experience.  We noticed the manager popping in and out of the dining room but he never stopped at a single table. That's just a pet peeve as a manager. Please talk to your guests if you have time. It's important to get feed back other than the internet.  All in all, the pasta dishes we had were good. The bread service with their pepper and oil dip was tasty. The wine list was fair, though pricy. I understand why they charge as much as they do but for the love of God it's not that hard to make Chocolate mousse in house.  The end",

For my main dish I ordered the chicken Fra Diavalo the portion was perfect for leftovers. Lastly we finished with Zeppole's  there ricotta cheese filled doughnuts stuffed with Nutella chocolate. It was a memorable night spent with family. Would return!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I stumbled upon Luciano's for dinner kind of accidentally on a Wednesday night and we hit the jackpot. It was half off wine and had delicious authentic Italian cuisine! We shared a delicious bottle of Pinot Grigio that was only $18 and started off with some warm, fresh-out-of-the-oven bread with an olive oil/tomato dip. We ordered a caesar salad and tomato soup to start, and they were delicious. The tomato soup was really outstanding--creamy and flavorful. For our main dishes, we ordered the Linguine Carbonara and the Tortelloni. While both were delicious, the brown butter on my Tortelloni was slightly too greasy and over-powering. The walnuts on my tortelloni also felt like an afterthought. However, the ricotta filling was refreshing and made the dish really outstanding.  The menu is extensive, so it definitely warrants another visit soon!",

    "text": "Came here for my mom's bday dinner, last minute reservation because the original restaurant was too backed up. My parents had been here before on a weeknight and liked it, so we figured why not. They sat us immediately which was great. Our server was nice, sometimes hard to find, but otherwise not bad. The drink times were a little crazy, it seemed like the only had one bartender for a weekend night so we had to wait quite a while for drinks to be served. We started off with the burrata and goat cheese appetizers (mom is veggie and she loves cheese), and they were both good, and came out super quickly. A few of us got Caesar salads, and everyone's had the butts of the romaine in it, I personally don't mind them, but my wife and brothers were browning and dirty. For main, everyone got various pastas and meats, veggie flatbread was good, mushroom ravioli was super salty bc of the breadcrumbs, other pastas were decent. I got the lamb, and asked for medium, it came out more of a well done, I didn't mind that too much, but my main gripe was the veggie and sauce, the alcohol in the sauce wasn't cooked off, and since the whole dish was soaked in this sauce, everything including the lamb had that taste. We had a tuxedo cake and tiramisu for dessert, again both decent, tiramisu came out collapsed in a blob, but the flavor wasn't bad. All in all, I'd maybe try again on a weekday, but my main concern was for The prices the food quality has to be on point. $45 for 3 overcooked double lamb chops covered in some sort tomato sauce with raw alcohol is a little too much.",

I actually didn't even realize Luciano's existed where it was, I must have driven past a dozen times or so.   On a busy Saturday night we were seated in the middle of the restaurant immediately.   The server was very kind and prompt.   When we sat the waiter placed down bread with a tomato dipping sauce. It tasted good, wasn't anything super memorable. I ordered the eggplant parmigana. It came out of the oven steaming hot. It was perfectly crisp, but not oily. The portion size was normal too - not overly large or too small. I thought the food was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Next time I will order a special dish.  The decor on the inside is really nice. It felt like a more expensive restaurant then it was - which was nice.  We'll definitely come back - hope to have a dish that really wows me!",

Server came back to say he didn't have hash browns 20 minutes after we had put in our order, then our food came out but the refill potatoes came out 10 minutes after our food. Thankfully those were hot. We were told they only had enough OJ for 3 mimosas, so we could not order more. He server was nice enough to take the cake to the kitchen and cut it.

Yet the time my son and I went here without my husband they acted like I was trash and even called the police without me even knowing what was gonna on to \"get me out of there.\" They said that I was neglecting my child by being on facetime next to the table! Yet left out the part where my son was also on his device. Even the cops were confused and just let me leave. But it was humiliating! A WAITRESS doesn't get to make the call on who looks good in their restaurant! Discrimination! I was enjoying my meal and looked up to the police surrounding me and I had ZERO IDEA what was going on! They also said I was inebriated, yet they hadn't even served me a drink! And I DO NOT DRINK. I'll never forget it! If you aren't a white Christian male I'd be wary of eating here! I was so close to using my influencer status on Instagram to publicly bash this restaurant for discrimination, but I was even too humiliated to do that! Before they judge, they should know who they are dealing with! I was not rude, nothing to deserve what happened! I was blindsided and I'm still in awe to this day about it! They did not ask me to leave or say anything! They acted like everything was fine and then called the police to get me out of there and open up a table for the incoming lunch rush! I hope that the waitress got FIRED! My BABY was with me and everything!!!!!! He could have gotten taken away and put into a horrible, dangerous, poverty level foster home all so that they can keep up the reputation of their restaurant to not house hipsters and ethnic ppl! There is no other excuse for why they called! If there was then the police wouldn't have came, been totally confused, and then let me just leave without any sort of warning or ANYTHING! WATCH OUT!",

However, it took them 10 min. To figure out who our server was going to be.  That was weird!  Lady brought us waters and I asked if she was our server?  She said she wasn't sure.  Another man asked if we had be talked to, I said no.  Then the water server came back.   Bread was delicious as usual...  I asked her what the soup of the day was??  She said WHITE bean and sausage with vegetables,  I said, it probably doesn't, but could you just double check that it doesn't have peas.  She said sure, do you still want it if it does??  I said absolutely not, please let me know if it does and I'll make another selection.  She came back to tell me it just has carrots, I said great.  Then as she's walking away... and lentils.  I said to my Sister, did she say lentils?  I think so, weird I've never heard of white bean and lentil soup!  Of course it came as all lentil soup.  She offered to go back and see if they had any white beans to put it!   Sister ordered penne with chicken/ broccoli  blue cheese Alfredo sauce.  $15.    Very disappointing!!! Worst meal ever there.  Sauce was watery, thin and lack flavor.  What little there was went to the bottom of the bowl.  Chicken tasted like microwave reheated tough meat. I tried it, then a manager came by and we showed him. They brought her another chicken breast and extra sauce.  Even though you could tell this chicken was freshly cooked, it was a little rubbery. I'm not sure if they use the highest quality meat?? The sauce was better, but still lacked flavor.   I guess I'll have to stick with eating there in the evening, and the gnocchi which I love. I hope that the evening meals haven't went downhill. Not sure I'll be back anytime soon, which is very disappointing.  Because I use to tell everyone that this was one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. A couple years ago I went here for lunch, and had an amazing experience. I guess you win some and you lose some. I'm not the type of person that repeat restaurants in less I love them, sorry to say my Love was lost  yesterday.  To many other choices to pick from for $15 penne!",

    "text": "I was actually really really excited about this place as my boyfriend and I absolutely adore Italian food. We both work so much and have pretty much opposite schedules so getting a night off - finally - together and able to go out to eat was really exciting especially to a place we talked about for months since we've moved to this side of town. For whatever reason it was completely empty inside around 815 or so except for us and another table and one couple at the bar. I had been dreaming about the Gorgonzola crusted filet for what had seemed forever. We sat at the bar and the bartender was great attentive and friendly. We were served the bread and red sauce upon sitting down and ordered a glass of wine and a beer. My boyfriend ordered a pasta dish that was quite good but I can't remember the name of it and I ordered the filet I mentioned earlier. His came out perfect however my Gorgonzola crusted filet came out with no Gorgonzola instead with a mushroom sauce of some sort and that is probably the one thing I really just cannot handle, mushrooms... so even though I hate doing it I sent it back. When they returned with my \"new\" steak it was undoubtedly the same just wiped clean and with Gorgonzola cheese on top and not even warm. Needless to say I was just really sad mostly because of how excited I had been for so long leading up to getting to try it. I ate it it was just ok the actual filet itself didn't have much flavor and was a little tougher than I thought a filet should be. To remedy the issue the manager never came to talk to me just sent out a random dessert which unfortunately was wasted on me since I never order dessert I really am not a sweets person.   It seemed like a nice place and there were other good aspects to it. I would definitely consider another visit to see if I caught them on an off day but the fact that they reused my steak without asking if mushrooms were a dislike or if it was an allergy didn't sit well with me. My boyfriends pasta was really good though and all the other reviews on Yelp seem to be consistently great so maybe we'll give it another go later down the road.",

I will start off with the decor etc.  They need to turn down the lights its way to bright in the restaurant but indo like the color scheme and art, just my opinion. Lets move onto the food. They give you bread with red sauce which the sauce was very good so i was excited for the rest of dinner. We ordered the shrimp appetizer.  1st, it took over 20 minutes to get the shrimp appetizer. The shrimp were perfectly cooked but the sauce was not very flavorful the lemon in the sauce overpowered all the other spices.  We ordered the shrimp fradiavlo and ordered it spicy. Again, the shrimp and pasta were perfectly cooked. The sauce was not spicy at all and very bland, no taste what so ever.  Chef needs to look at the recipes and look to add more spices to the sauces. Our search for the perfect Italian restaurant continues.",

    "text": "I tried to think of some reason as to why I shouldn't give Luciano's 5 stars and, as you can tell, I couldn't think of a single one.   I absolutely love this place. We've lived less than a block away for over a year and finally just ventured over and we're SO happy we did! I like the inside of the restaurant as it's decor is very nice but not stuffy, it feels homey while looking like quite a 'fancy' restaurant - which is hard to accomplish, but they did it.  To start, our servers have always been 100% spot on; Great personalities and great service. Along with our main server, there is plenty of staff to keep our waters and delicious bread filled. We have also never waited long for our meals, no matter how packed it been or what time of night. Managers come by and sometimes there is a band playing. Plenty of people to keep you happy while at Luciano's.   Now for food...holy delicious. Our first time we tried a pasta and one of their chicken specials for entrees and both were a great amount of food, not too much but very filling and both just tasted so good(note: I have been looking everywhere for a chicken marsala as good as my dads and Luciano's is as close as it gets). Tom was really impressed with how many meatballs and mozzarella were in his pasta (apparently other places really skimp).  Another time we went for just appetizers and I'm gonna lay this out because we were amazed. We got the carpaccio and I swear, enough for 6 people and perfectly done. There was plenty to go around for just us two and the aioli and arugula salad on top was great. We also got the calamari which were cooked perfectly and also had the great aioli sauce to compliment it. However, for me, the Holy Grail was their Scallops and Artichoke antipasti (bow your heads for a moment). It was perfect. The scallops were cooked perfectly. The long stem artichokes were tender and so so tasty and perfect. The pancetta, perfect. And...the lemon sauce, perfect. I had to ask for an entire other bread basket just so I get every little bit of that lemon sauce. Amazingly perfect.   Okay, enough about my obsession with the food and scallops. We love this place. They always find us a seat, we always have great service, there is complimentary valet, the vibe is awesome and the prices are surprisingly modest for the quality and amount of food. I can confidently say, this is my favorite Italian and restaurant in Charlotte so far. Check it out.",

    "text": "I went in as a skeptic because I'm such a big fan of Fiamma's, but I found I can love both!  I have to say I like the classy ambiance and decor of Luciano's much better than Fiamma's, and especially love the heavy rich crown moulding and wainscoting, stacked stone fire oven, painted tin ceiling and chandeliers. We also thought the high top large tables were cute and looked forward to sitting there for dinner.  I can only speak to lunchtime Luciano's experiences, but both were positive! George R. did a great job describing the menu.  The bread was delicious and the sundried tomato pesto was a nice change.    The lunch deals are a steal. Somehow I missed them the first time I went so I ordered eggplant parmesan which was delicious and I loved that the eggplant wasn't individually fried, therefore making it more fatty than necessary. It had a heavy layer of mozz/parm on top of the eggplant so you could easily push it to the side and make it light/healthy. My buddy got the salmon which he really liked but it looked a tad overcooked for my liking.   The next time I got a lunch combo, which was half a Misto salad and a HUGE plate of tomato basil gnocchi. I liked the sauce a lot it came in and generally the gnocchi was good though definitely were soggy/soft and lacked the crisp on the outside. There are few places that get gnocchi right in town... But what made it better is that the combo was only $7.95. Seriously- that's Noodles & Co pricing for amazing ambiance! And I had leftovers!   My hubby got the lunch deal where you get a soup or salad, entree and dessert for $12.95 which was the deal of the century. He had a tomato bisque which was lovely, then there were several entree choices- he picked the penne with italian sausage and spinach which was great. That was filling enough, but then the piece de resistance was the tiramisu which was traditional style with plenty of coffee flavor, and substantial but not too rich.    Bottom line: Nice ambiance, good food, good value. We'll be back.  Side note: this would be a lovely place for a private event like an office dinner or something- I bet you could rent out the enclosed patio.",

Service was spectacular with several wait staff attending to us as needed. Beverages never went empty as each course was timed perfectly. From the $7.95 lunch special to the full portion scallops and artichokes, every bite was a delight to the palette. You've got to try the Goat Cheese Pomodoro for an appetizer - if you can put down the fresh bread with sun dried tomato sauce that comes with every meal. For desert, oh my..... we tried the Tiramisu, Molten Chocolate Cake, and the Zeppole (Ricota Cheese Filled Italian Doughnuts). Whatever you do, don't leave without the Zeppole. No way you can eat them all, but just one will send your taste buds to Heaven. Prices by the way, were very reasonable for this quality of food. You won't beat this place for Italian anywhere in Charlotte, not for any amount of money. We will be returning very soon.",

We ordered strawberry shortcake for dessert, and it was perfect. Light, fluffy, and topped with a couple strawberries. A manager came around to make sure everything was great. When our server brought our bill, he informed us dessert was on the house--THEN brought us 2 chocolate covered strawberries to end the night! It was great. I recommend sitting in the sunroom area at the window.",

I got the flat bread pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil. My husband got the chicken parm which was delicious. It should be noted that he is Italian so his family makes chicken parm all the time and he said this one was the best restaurant version he's ever had. We were both too stuffed to try dessert but will definitely try that next time.   The service was great we had one waiter who took our order then another who kept our drinks filled. Also of note we went on a Friday night a little before the dinner rush (7 pm) as we had other plans for later. Overall a great experience and we will definitely be back.",

It is a little pricey and even with a $25 discount our bill was a little steep for what we got.  I had the special spinach stuffed tortellini with shrimp in vodka sauce.  It was good but not worth the $24 price tag.  The gelato and cappuccino were authentic, especially the latter.   It was real Italian style and not the steamed kind like you get in American coffee shops.  Others have raved about the chopped salad but it was just iceberg lettuce in oil, something I can do for about 50 cents at home and easily.",

It looks incredibly gorgeous while managing to stay comfortable and relaxing versus that \"too trendy\" look many places are going for these days. In the center of it is all is a cozy wood fired stove...  They work in teams here and are VERY attentive. So if you're put off by literally being taken care of while dining, this may not be your place. I for one, was very impressed and it truly felt like everyone was in it together to make my experience unique and wonderful. The service is what takes it over the top to a five star review.   The food was really flavorful, it's Italian with a twist. The crusty bread served with a sundried tomato dip was something I've never had before and something I must have again, It was awesome! I went with the ravioli which was very heavy but the sauce did taste good. I like my pasta rolled out a tad bit thinner but that is me being nit-picky. I was in love with my fiances lasagna (deconstructed)-so I might go that route next time. If you're a cheese fan (as I am) they do not skimp.   Most of the dishes are in the $15-20, drinks in $7-12 range ...they do serve a brunch on Sunday with bottomless cocktail options ( I believe they said sangria, bloody mary's, and mimosas). Can't wait to try brunch next!",

My sons both enjoyed their meals and my husband was thrilled when the chef prepared some mushroom risotto especially for him.

Everyone's drinks were good as well. My birthday tiramisu dessert was divine.   The manager, I believe, was gracious to capture a couple of photos for us. Very kind.   The cons:   Though attentive, our waitress tended to insert her body & reach over people's food and drinks a lot. Asking someone to pass something to her would've been appropriate.   A member of our party became very ill after dinner and was sick with food poisoning symptoms for several days. Disclaimer: It wasn't confirmed that he indeed had food poisoning.   The bar was playing Django on the tv, of all things. We were all very confused and uncomfortable with it. Odd choice of entertainment.   Overall:  I enjoyed my birthday dinner and would definitely return to this restaurant!",

I ordered the Fettuccini Carbonara (with a bonus meatball as a personal touch), and a wedge salad. The blue cheese on the salad was bold and tasty, loved it. Actually asked for some extra blue cheese because it was so delicious. The Carbonara was one of the best I have had. Homemade pasta with thick cream sauce, bacon, peas. Excellent entree. The meatball, made with beef, pork and veal was OK. I like meatballs, so I thought I would try one anyway. Our waiter was quiet but efficient. Although he messed up our initial drink order, he and the manager comped our group some dessert at the end of our meal (tiramisu and cheesecake). Overall, great dinner.

And two of those experiences combined sort took it down a notch as far as how I liked it. I think the dishes that I ordered were not bad, but to be honest, I don't see myself coming back unless I'm overruled by the family.   I initially would have been a 4 star review, but because of the second time around it changed my mind about it. Why? It's because what we were served during our second time when we decided to try out their seafood. Let's just say the shell fish wasn't so fresh. Anyways, other than that the food here was pretty much the same.   We ordered a bunch of different types of dishes. (Look at the photos) and you can see what we all ordered. I tried the brick chicken as well as the pizza for the second time. Both of the dishes were alright, and not really anything exciting. It was cooked well and the chicken was okay, but I think it was a little dry.  There's nothing that pushes this place over the top compared to other Italian restaurants. But, the seafood that was just a little bit old and has a funky smell to it while being charged for it was a little upsetting to me. It was offered to take it off the bill, but it was already paid by the time that happened. We usually don't say anything, but this was a little bit too much. We enjoyed our time here and it's a great atmosphere and amazing service, but it's just alright in my book for Italian food.",

    "text": "This was my first time here. Being connected to a parking garage is great. The lighting is too dark IMO; reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory. I understand trying to set an ambiance, but I wanna see my food when I'm eating. Be prepared to not have any internet connection. We asked the server for the WiFi info.   I really hate that I forgot servers name, but she was AMAZING. We had a rather large party (10+) and she served us all by herself!   I ordered the chicken parm and baked goat cheese pomodoro. I had looked at the menu beforehand and went in with the mindset that I would order the eggplant parm, but it wasn't available. Others in my party wanted that as well; we were pretty disappointed.   The baked goat cheese pomodoro was decent. It basically reminded me of a thick tomato soup but the goat cheese made it better. The chicken parm was delicious. I would definitely order it again. If you're a saucy person like me, I would suggest getting some extra sauce on the side. I feel that If I didn't, it would've been a little dry.",

Tonight it was exceptional We had the fillet as well as the red snapper which was amazing. The bread that they serve with dinner was delicious and crusty. Also our server Sebastian, which is probably his wrong name was really exceptional It was a beautiful night We sit outside nice breeze. The restaurant was beautiful We will come back soon. Thank you for a great experience.",

The food was delicious. I got the chicken piccata and we shared the burrata and the goat cheese appetizer with the table. It was all very tasty and came out hot. Multiple servers helped out with our big party and it was very helpful. The restaurant is big enough to host larger parties and is accommodating to that as well.

They were not busy at all around 7 PM, which was a little concerning I guess. You would think they would have more business at that hour. The waiter was very prompt and attentive.   I shared two appetizers with my friend and we also ordered a special to split as the entree. The appetizers were a good size and we left feeling full. They also serve bread, which was pretty delicious- (who doesn't love bread?!). The entree for the night was ok. I would definitely choose something different next time. The marinara sauce was decent, so maybe a dish with that or meatballs.",

    "text": "I wished I ordered something else since the Rigatoni Salsiccia tasted like it came from a fast food Italian place. The sauce and the sausage tasted like it was supposed to be the ingredients for the pizza. The sauce was described as spicy, but I didn't taste or feel any hint of heat. And the pasta were a bit undercooked? If the fresh mozzarella was a bit warmer/heated, it would have made the dish a bit better.   Most of my table were happy with their food. I had a taste of the Chicken under the Brick. That was a good choice. Plus the mashed potatoes were perfectly garlicky. The toasted garlic bread was worth the extra price instead of just getting the regular table bread.  I do appreciate the great service. For people who carry purses or bags, you can request a purse stand so you don't have to awkwardly hang it on the chairs or place it on the floor. The to-go bag was not a regular plastic bag, but it was a reusuable bag!",

    "text": "Ate dinner here last Friday (6/28), and it's probably closer to 3.5 stars, but I'm a tough grader. This restaurant is not for everyone. The service is slow - but I like not being rushed. The service is also good - very friendly waiter and the manager came by to check on us.  The food is somewhat hit or miss. We started with the fried calamari, which is exactly like every other calamari appetizer you've ever had, anywhere. Super bland. But, I guess, shame on me for ordering the calamari when I knew better.   I then had the Gorgonzola wedge salad, which is also exactly like most other wedge salads, but delicious.   For the entree, my wife had pork and mashed potatoes, which was excellent. I had the chicken parm, which was (again) your basic chicken parm in style, but awful in execution. The capellini that accompanies was dry and small in portion, with a bland tomato sauce - looked like it had been sitting around. The chicken breast tasted like something that came out of a box. Truly, I've made much better at home and had much better at an Olive Garden style restaurant. So that was a bummer.   The cocktails were a tad watery. I'm no fan of the bars with a light pour, and this is one of them.   Overall, I liked it here. Surprisingly, there are not many great Italian restaurants in town, and this is not one of them. But it's a very good one worth checking out. It was a little slow for a Friday night - doubtless because some of the menu is a bit poorly executed and the drinks are a little weak - but I'm rooting for this place to continue to stick around, and will be back.",

The ambiance is romantic I suggest seating on the outside patio (its closed in) Everything I've ever had on the menu was absolutely outstanding and I've basically tried the entire menu. The Lamb chops superb, the veal meatballs had a beautiful sauce textured perfectly. The Veal piccata was done to blissful perfection with the light lemon sauce.Of course you have to get the zeppolis to top it off that's fried pizza dough with nutella in the middle and powdered sugar sprinkled on top! The entire experience is always straordinario",

I called my order in and the host told me where to park when I got there.  I ordered the lasagna, which also came with several pieces of warm soft and chewy bread and some type of oil and tomato sauce.  You already know how much I love fresh pasta so imagine my face as I sampled my food.........so amazing, so fresh, so rich and flavorful!  I would recommend bringing your appetite to this place, my to go order was very filling and I couldn't finish it all.   I definitely will return to try other entrees,  but it will be hard to pass on their lasagna.  It also appeared to be a nice location for a special occasion dinner.  They also give you the takeout order in their own recyclable bag, sweet!",

They also brought out bread and a delicious dipping sauce!   I loved my chicken parmigiana, and it was HUGE. Plenty to share for at least 2 people. My fiance also really enjoyed his chicken piccata.   We did not try the dessert because we were too full, but they looked delicious!! We will definitely return to this place!",

We were seated and offered water. The host also brought out this standing device that had hooks to hold our purses!  I thought that was neat.  Our drink orders were taken fairly soon.  Our small group arrived in stages, so I think that is why our server didn't ask us if we were ready to order.  We were finally given bread and this wonderful tomato/garlic/olive oil sauce.  This brought happiness to this very hungry gal!  I could have eaten that whole basket of bread, but I restrained myself in a lady like fashion to only eating two small pieces.  I was craving Fettucine Alfredo, so I ordered it.  I also ordered the chopped salad with blue cheese dressing.  It was only $4.50 with an entree.  But, when it arrived, it was massive!  It also came with extra blue cheese.  Not wanting to spoil my appetite for the main event, I regulated myself to eating half.  The server boxed up the rest for me.   The Fettucine Alfredo itself was ok.  It lacked richness as if it was made with milk instead of with cream.  Also, a hint of nutmeg would have been nice. It took awhile for food to arrive, but the happy, friendly attitude of the staff made up for it.   I could have made a meal off of the bread and salad alone.  Maybe that is what I will do next time I return.",

We had the scallop crudo and several different entrees. Everyone was pleased with their selection - did have to send back salmon as it was very undercooked. Bread pudding for dessert was a great finale to the dinner. I would go back and I recommend this restaurant. (Chose the exterior for seating because the inside was frigid).",

I ordered the special which was a seafood ravioli jam packed with multiple types of seafood with a great cream sauce over top.

The ambience is elegant, modern, but with traditional touches that prevent it from being overly trendy.  You feel classy and comfortable at the same time which I really like!  The service we had was great.  Quick to bring you water and drinks.  Wednesday is half-priced bottles which explains my mini headache as I type this on Thursday morning.  Instead of your typical olive oil, they bring out delicious crusty bread with sundried tomato and parmesan dip/spread. It is incredibly delicious. We split the wood grilled octopus as an appetizer.  It's served over a crushed chickpea mixture.  It was a unique and delectable combination.   As my entree I ordered the zuppa di mare (seafood soup).  An incredibly flavorful tomato based broth FULL of calamari, shrimp, scallops and mussels.  It's a very generous portion.  I am really looking forward to eating my leftovers.  I can't recommend Luciano's enough. I can't wait to return!",

We had to wait 20 minutes until a server asked us for drinks and this was only after we had approached the management about why there was a delay. There was not even an explanation about why the delay occurred. The manager was nice about it and comped our drinks. Subsequently, the waiter that ended up taking our order seemed to be put out. The food we got was angel hair pasta and it was clumped together, as if it were old and reheated or something. As I said earlier, this was very disappointing.  Especially since it was our anniversary celebration and we had made arrangements for a babysitter to enjoy a special evening. Over the past four years we have generally had very good experiences. It seems as though there may be some issues that have crept in over the past few months as we are seeing others with similar experiences on yelp.",

The bread w/ sun dried tomato is a nice change of pace. Both entrees were excellent, hot and cooked well. The service was superb, very nice and polite and never left wondering where they ran off to.   Parking/Valet: 1/5 stars  If you're coming here for dinner, just go ahead and bank on using the valet. The self parking deck is tight, small, and only 1 way up, 1 way down. If you get to the top and there are no spots, you've got to awkwardly turn around at the top in a tiny space.   The valet... Oh my the valet. I drive a manual car, which is admittedly a dying breed. But with a valet, they should be able to at the very least park it. THIS IS NOT THE CASE AT THIS LOCATION. The gentlemen that picked my car up when we arrived stalled right away. He started the car again and lurched his way to a parking spot. The same thing happened when another gentlemen delivered the car back to us.   2 valet people, both stalled and lurched the car the whole way. This place isn't worth my time and risking not getting my car back in one piece.",

I liked it.  The food was simply incredible. I mean really, really incredible. I have eaten at so many Italian joints, from kitschy to stuffy to authentic to unknown neighborhood spots to chain restaurants. But this place really takes the cake. Everything we had was phenomenal. Nothing even just \"OK.\" We had the wood grilled octopus and goat cheese pomodoro. Both should not be missed, but the goat cheese was just ridiculously delicious. I had a wedge salad and my wife had a Caprese salad...both very near perfection. I had the Zuppa di mare, or seafood stew, and it was packed with calamari, scallops, mussels, clams, shrimp, and white fish. I can't begin to tell you how much i enjoyed it. My wife had the Gorgonzola beef filet. She said it was only second to Del Frisco's, which is quite a compliment, especially for a non-steakhouse. We finished with a Nutella custard and Nutella filled doughnuts. God, it was so good.  The service was something I would expect at a much more expensive restaurant. Our server, Christopher, addressed every need and was just the right amount of cordial and friendly with us.  Prices were very reasonable...especially for the quality. Most entrees were $15-$20 and topped out at $33.   Literally zero complaints from this place. Just a perfect evening we had there. I am hoping that it wasn't  If they can keep up this service and quality of food, they are going to give Luce, Toscana, Villa Antonio, etc. a run for their money.  Edit: We went back for Mother's Day tonight with my mother and mother in law. Again, service and food were superb. Everyone enjoyed everything. We left in a bit of a food coma, but it was well worth it. Christopher was our server once again upon request, and his service was exceptional again. He remembered us and made us feel at home with our moms. This is just a really great spot...love it!",

The bread and sun dried tomato dip was an excellent way to start the meal. I don't typically like sun dried tomatoes but this dip was warm and almost tasted meaty. I mentioned to my friends that I could have an entire basket of bread and dip for dinner and I would be completely satisfied. They agreed. We all ordered the special of the night which was bass and risotto with mushrooms. When it came out, it was gnocchi, which was completely fine with me since I had been craving gnocchi but don't usually order it since it quickly fills me up. The fish was cooked perfectly, a little crispy skin and yummy mushroom sauce. Just as I expected, I ate all the gnocchi and couldn't finish my fish.

I guess they went with the buffet to get you in and get you out quickly.  It was definitely not worth the price.",

The goat cheese marinara app was the beast.  Luciano's house marinara sauce was the best I've had too. Ambience in the main dining has a great vibe.  We'll be back!  Great restaurant. Great staff!

A bit slow with services like fresh ground pepper and grated cheese. Also, seat was broken and cut my finger on it - ouch! Told the manager and he was indifferent.   My chicken parmigiana was okay, a bit dry. Wedge salad was as satisfying, flavorful, and tasty - particularly the well seasoned bacon.   My dinner companions were very pleased with their dishes - eggplant parmigiana and linguini carbonara.",

They have a great selection of entrees, all the times I have been here have been almost prefect!  You can't go wrong with any dessert at this place! The cannoli is the best in the entire city, it is fresh and the filling is very rich. The cheesecake is mostly outstanding too, sometimes the cheesecake hasn't been as good as it could have been, but overall it has been great.   This restaurant has the best Italian in the city!, 2nd place goes to Maggianos which also is perfect 5/5.   If you go here, most definitely get an appetizer and dessert.",

    "text": "My husband and I came here this past Tuesday night (4/19/16) and we were extremely glad we had picked this place to go to! We went around 9:30PM and decided to sit outside since the weather was so nice. The service staff was extremely nice and helpful. Our server (who also appeared to be the bartender as well) was able to make the best recommendations for both of our entrees. I would have taken pictures, but my phone battery was too low :(   We were served bread and butter to start, and I loved the bread as it was warm, soft and yummy.  The entrees did take a while to come out, but that was my only complaint through the entire night and it was so delicious that it was well worth the wait. My husband ordered their version of a deconstructed lasagna and it was the best lasagna we had ever eaten. I ordered the capellini bolognese and it was also absolutely delicious! Both dishes were extremely flavorful but not overpowering. There was literally nothing that could have been changed to either dish to improve anything about them as they tasted perfectly as they were already! We also tried the strawberry shortcake which was also absolutely amazing!  I really enjoyed being able to sit outside and the atmosphere that was created outside using the candle light was very pleasant and romantic for us since we were celebrating.   Overall, for two drinks and two entrees, we spent about $60 before tip, which was extremely reasonable considering the great experience we had. I would definitely recommend eating here and I also plan to dine here again the next time I visit Charlotte. Thank you to our server and everyone involved in giving us a wonderful birthday dining experience! Please keep up the great work! :)",

    "text": "5 stars to me since it's been a challenge finding exceptional quality food establishments in NC. I know I'm a bit spoiled having lived in Chicago all my life and visited New York a few times for work. There's nothing wrong with having a high standard when it comes to nourishing your body with good food. Can I get an amen?!  So far Luciano's has met my foodie expectations: 1. Ambiance- romantic, classy, yet still good for a family dinner with little ones 2. Decor- modern with traditional accents 3. Service- courteous, attentive, and inviting 4. Food- light but decadent enough to allow those Italian flavors to come through 5. Value- a final bill for a family of six in the amount of $88!!!! It would have been higher if we would have ordered their seafood or angus steak plates. Next time.  Our server Ronald went above and beyond attending to our table. Patient and attentive. He didn't up sell on any dish and pretty much told us we can't go wrong with anything in the menu.   Overall, our plates ranged from individual pizzas, chicken under the oven, Fettuccini Alfredo, and chicken piccata, which we all loved.   The bonus was making our daughters birthday dinner here more special by presenting her with a chocolate brownie with a side of ice cream. It was absolute bliss, according to my daughter. She gave me a bite (very tiny one) and I agree.  Try this place. It's really good.",

    "text": "I thought with the fantastic reviews, especially from some Yelpers that I usually have very similar tastes to, that I was going to be wowed and then some by Luciano's.  Well... it was decent, but I felt our meal was one small step above Olive Garden (gasped and clutched my pearls as I typed that).  With a Yelp check-in, you could enjoy 10% off of your meal as of 12/27/15.  The interior space is lovely - the chandeliers on the patio are beautiful.    The food: Menu:  BAKED GOAT CHEESE POMODORO: Baked herbed goat cheese, toasted garlic ciabatta bread. Realness:  A golf ball sized lump of very good goat cheese dropped in a bowl full of pomodoro sauce.  The cheese and bread were quite good, but was not expecting the tomato bath - I should have asked more questions, my bad.  Menu:  WEDGE: Fresh Iceberg, chopped tomatoes, bacon, creamy authentic Parmigiano dressing, and crumbled Gorgonzola cheese Realness:  The iceberg had a very tough core portion that was left on.  Bacon tasted a bit off, dressing and cheese were good.  I really love wedge salads, but was not atwitter over this one.  Menu:  GNOCCHI: Baked with prosciutto di parma, and gorgonzola cream Realness:  Barely any prosciutto (I had 2 small pieces with dinner and 3 small pieces when I had it reheated for lunch the next day).  The gnocchi and sauce were good.  It was better reheated the next day.    I had the strawberry shortcake for dessert and it was light and tasty.    Complimentary bread is served with a plate of tomato sauce for your meal.  Bread was warm and fresh.  The wait staff was excellent and stayed on top of drink refills, though we did need to ask for plates to be removed.  We were at a small 2-top table even though the restaurant was basically empty on the Sunday after Christmas from 6 until 8.  After looking at pictures of the interior, I thought I needed to dress a little better than jeans and a cardigan, but it seems that most of the people there had on jeans, polos, khakis and even a couple of mooks who didn't take their baseball caps off while dining.    They have a separate area for large group dining.    There is valet parking or you can try your luck in the parking garage that is shared with Sullivan's.  The lot is a bit of a cluster, so during peak times, I would use the valet, but we had no trouble on a rainy Sunday night.  For an appetizer, 2 salads, 2 entrees and 2 desserts, the total was just under $80.  My date was absolutely delightful and the setting was lovely, so it was a very nice evening, but it was just A-OK, nothing stood out.",

But once you get the food it is OK, wines and alcohol are very high prices and I understand volumes and measures but, further, spending $14 for a glass of decent wine and being served an inch in a large glass was insulting.  Menu is pretty basic with few special items that you would expect from a five star place, but not here.    Their sun dried tomato olive oil and cheese dip is out of this world, worthy of a spoon or a much larger ration of bread.  It is OK, but too expensive for what you get for your stomach rather than your eyes.",

The bread with the goat cheese pomodoro is crisp and chewy and once again the tomato sauce was impossible to stop eating. We had a wedge salad, a veggie pizza, and linguine carbonara. The dressing on the wedge salad was super creamy. The veggie pizza was a great mix of veggies and the linguine carbonara did not last long despite how full we were. Great food and atmosphere!",

The food: we started with the goat cheese pomodoro. It was a delicious marinara and goat cheese blend with awesome garlic bread - great appetizer. I ordered the rigatoni salsicia and she got the spaghetti & meatballs. Both pasta dishes were excellent, and you could tell the pasta was freshly made egg pasta, rather than dry pasta from a box. The flavors were great in both dishes, and the meatballs were huge and tasty! We chose the triple layer mousse cake for dessert after viewing all the selections, and it was light and delicious. It was a perfect sweet endnote to the meal without being a huge portion of dessert that leaves you stuffed. The service was great as well. Our waiter was attentive, and the busboy/ server assistant helped box our food, take plates, etc. The main sticking point: my girlfriend and I were debating about whether a cherry or strawberry on top would be better on the mousse cake.. so our server brought out ramekins with a few of each for us. It was a small but nice touch to end a great meal.",

    "text": "Our friends had a wonderful meal here during restaurant week so we were excited to try this place. Unfortunately we did not have as wonderful of an experience. There were four of us all together. The tomato bisque soup was delicious but was lukewarm at best. Two of us had chopped salads which were mediocre in flavor and somewhere the concept of 'chopped' got lost. My lasagne had great flavor but the noodles were clumped together. My husband had the rigatoni with Italian sausage which had good spice to it but the pasta was extremely al dente for our tastes.  Our friend's shrimp fra diavolo was good but lacked any spice to it-it needed a bit more kick. Our other friend's shrimp scampi on risotto had beautiful presentation and I think overall she enjoyed her meal.   The service, too, lacked severely. The restaurant was busy as there were several parties of high schoolers eating there for prom but not all tables were filled so it wasn't crazy busy yet 10-15 minutes would pass without seeing our server. We never received a refill of our bread or water. My husband had to ask a different server to bring him the blue cheese stuffed olives that his martini was served without. We stopped what appeared to be the Maitre d to complain that the martini itself was watered down and he was very rude in his interaction with us. A new martini was made immediately and was much better. I would not consider us to be high maintenance customers but when you don't receive what was ordered or even a spoon to eat your soup with and there are no apologies or friendly, efficient service, it makes for some very aggravated consumers. We will not be returning to this restaurant.",

Luciano's offers special lunch selections of 3 courses; soup or salad, main dish and dessert.  Our server, Kyle, didn't rush courses and flowed the service as a pro. The sundried tomatoes in olive oil served with bread as a starter (and complimentary) were SO delicious! The bean and sausage soup was rich and scrumptious. The grilled, brick chicken was fabulous with just the perfect blackening at corners of the chicken. And creme brulee to finish was great. I can't wait to return! BTW, I \"fine dine\" quite often and am extremely critical of food, service and ambiance. A big 10 on all to Luciano's!",

However, because of the beautiful way it was handled and the incredible understanding and sympathy of not only our waitress but also the manager on duty, I can hands down say that it was a completely honest mistake on the part of the kitchen, something that after our experience would be examined and re-examined so as to never happen again. With that saying, we truly had a, aside from this one incident, an incredible experience and I would visit Luciano's again in a heartbeat. I always forget how much I love Italian food until I have fabulous Italian food, Luciano's reminded me of that love once again (note: my partner in Italian, that is no accident friends!). We were lucky enough to be able to set up a reservation an hour before we wanted to eat online and walked in and were seated right away. Immediately we felt welcomed, by our waitress and the manager, who at the time we didn't even know was the manager. I love that they have a manager on duty that greets each table and brings bread, water, etc., just welcomes people to the restaurant.   The bread is made out-of-house by baked in house and is fantastic, especially when paired with an incredible, somewhat spicy marinara. Funny, my Italian partner makes homemade sauce often, and his favorite thing is to dip fresh bread into the sauce, must be an Italian thing! For entrees we ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza: Smoked chicken, red onions, avocado, fresh cilantro, and the chicken parmigiana. I honestly couldn't say a negative thing about either dish, they were superb. The pizza would be a good two person meal or appetizer. I loved the new take on BBQ chicken, the avocado, red onion and cilantro complimented it perfectly. It's not often, after having a \"bad\" experience in a restaurant, that you'd rush to go back. But the food was so fabulous, the service stellar and the situation was handled so graciously, that I will definitely be heading back to Luciano's!",

    "text": "We went to Luciano's  the other day thinking this place was just a chain restaurant and similar to Carrabba's.  We were definitely wrong.  Luckily our curbed expectations led to a very pleasant surprise. (PS - There is nothing wrong Carrabba's)  The inside of the restaurant is very nice, and feels upscale.  Luckily the prices are not 'upscale' in nature for the food or drinks.  The BIG PLUS here is their SERVICE.  It was exceptional.  Everyone was extremely helpful, friendly, and polite.  The service reminded of something you would see at a very nice steakhouse.  For drinks, we tried the Strawberry Lemon Drop  and the Pometini.  Both were delicious, especially the Strawberry Lemon Drop.  My only tiny gripe is that they could have been stronger, but they were not watered down.  In terms of food, we got plenty of their bread, which was warm and delicious, with some kind of olive oil dipping sauce that had a tomato-y taste to it.  For the entree, we tried their Lasagna Coco Pazzo, which is much different (in a good way) than the traditional Lasagna that you would think of.  Great meat sauce and tons of cheese.  Also, a massive portion, so plan on bringing most of it home, especially if you get after it in the bread department.  For some reason, we decided to get a dessert, despite the mass quantities of food consumed 10 mins earlier.  We got the Zeppole, which are mini cinnamon sugar donuts with nutella and ricotta cheese in them. Very tasty, but I could have gone for some dipping sauces...because...why not.  When we saw this place open up, I thought Carrabba's would have competition, but now we are thinking Sullivan's will have to step their game up to keep us from going to Luciano's for a nice meal.",

We sampled a meatball from Luciano's at a Yelper party a few months ago, so when we were deciding on a nice dinner place, this was our top pick. Valet parking is complimentary, but you can also park in the deck right next store. We grabbed a table outside,cute patio and we even heard some live music from the bar across the street. Semi pricey drink options but a very good mule. With a pasta special and eggplant parm we left stuffed and satisfied. Our waitress was friendly and speedy. I will remember this place the next time I want to treat myself to some Italian!  Oh and if you check-in, you get to use a 10% off deal. Not a bad perk!",

However, the kitchen served overcooked soft mushy pasta with kind of boring sauce (aka gravy).  Most of the other dishes also scored pretty low when compared to better American Italian food out there... The dishes were mostly void of the souful and delicious Italian flavors I would expect at a better Italian restaurant serving this style of food.  I believe they may almost deserve 3 stars overall, as some people may enjoy it if they are not too used to eating great Italian food.  I am just not sure I will ever return.  If this place was in a big northern city with many better Italian restaurants available, I am not sure that it would remain in business unless it was in a remote shopping mall.  Even in CLT, I think there is better to be had...",

I called to make a reservation on my birthday for 9 people and was told there were no availabilities. Then, I recalled and got the reservation for 7 people. Upon arriving to the restaurant, not one other person was there, so I'm not sure why my original request for 9 people was denied.

The waiter offered to shred parmesan cheese on my plate. Well, he generously put a lot of cheese on my plate....and my pants. I'm not kidding, he was grating cheese on mine and my guests PANTS. \"Did he get cheese on you too?\" \"Yes, Bob, yes.\" (Why did that conversation even happen?) That was the first time I ever got rained on with cheese by someone. Didn't think it would be by a \"professional\" waiter at a very outstanding looking restaurant. Just don't dress your best, because your cute and sexy outfit might get rained on......by The Cheesy Waiter.   Oh yeah, another reason I give it 2 stars, is because the Lasagna was undercooked. I bit into a piece that was in the center of it and it was like I was biting into clay, dead serious. Sorry that's just my honest experience. But the desserts were awesome. But yeah, in conclusion, If the waiter cheeses you to death, speak up and tell him \"NO\"!",

Being new to the city I was very excited to see the neighborhood this restaurant was located in and it's beautiful ambience... The place is really very classy and perfect for a date.  The server told us about 10 different things which were not on the menu and they were flexible about making many things vegetarian... But even before I got there I knew I was going to order a mushroom ravioli.  So one colleague got the pasta with bolognese, I ordered the mushroom ravioli with white sauce and another colleague ordered the same with marinara sauce..... How I wish he had ordered a flat bread instead...  Anyway so we get our items and very excited to start.... And I taste something weird in the first bite and the bites to follow.... There was sour taste to the ravioli, my other confirmed the sour taste in his too and we told the server and manager about it,.. They confirmed that they received the ravioli just a day ago so it wudnt have spoilt etc... I asked the manager to taste it to check if that was how it was supposed to taste... Of course he dint taste it and offered to get us another one..... We should have just asked for something else at that point...  Anyway in about 20 mins me and my colleague got our raviolis again and this time with much lesser sauce....it still tasted sour !!! The manager stopped to check and I was blunt about the sour taste again..., and then he says... This time the chef confirmed they received the packet with goat cheese stuffing in the ravioli and that might be resulting in that different taste..... Well I would have loved to know this before ordering as I can't stand goat cheese at all!!!  All said and done, I dint enjoy what I ordered but that won't stop me from going back.... We ordered a chocolate dessert in the end which was great. And they did take my ravioli off the check but kept my colleagues coz he dint fuss about the second time it came...  The bread and sauce on the side was very good too..  Want to come back to try other things ...",

    "text": "Met up with friends and enjoyed a meal out in the Patio. It was beautiful. I love the decoration inside and outside. The price is very good for the food you get. I ordered the meatballs and they were the big meat balls with cheese inside. I could taste the freshness of the tomatoes in the sauce. I arrived a little late, so I didn't have a chance to enjoy an appetizer, but my friends were very pleased with it. I loved the service! My food was brought out right away and the waiter helped me design a drink accordingly to the mood I was in. He was very helpful and very nice. The service made our meal even more enjoyable. Definitely I place that I want to go back to in Charlotte!",

Menu was great, easy to read with enough options without being overwhelming. Would love to go back sometime. Had a salad with salmon that was cooked perfectly, per request (medium rare). It was a little pricey, I think the salmon salad plus a drink cost me $17. The bread and sun-dried tomato oil was different and nice. If you are looking for somewhere nice to go for Italian, I would go here.",

    "text": "This was our second time visiting Luciano's.  Both times there were about eight of us dining for a birthday celebration.  We went for brunch on Sunday. The warm bread with the sun-dried tomato and olive oil spread was delicious.  We must have gone through four or five loaves.  Most of us enjoyed the food. Lunch portions are enough to fill you up.  I had the omelet special with roasted potatoes and fresh fruit.  The omelet was stuffed with onions, peppers, mushrooms, ham and cheese.  It was delicious.  The birthday girl received a free strawberry cheesecake which was delish. Service was excellent.  They tacked on a 20% gratuity which we thought was a bit much.  But, one of us crossed that out and added her own tip amount.  I keep forgetting to do that.  But, will remember next time.  Atmosphere is lovely with tablecloths (even for lunch) and chandeliers.  Very nice.",

    "text": "We have been to Luciano's probably a dozen times.  Some visits better than others but positively and mostly consistent in both food and service.  Their food is a bit off the traditional end. If you are looking for lasagna and spaghetti with meatballs, you find it here but probably better off going to Carraba's for that.  Here it's their less traditional items which includes fish, chicken and some of the best steaks that rival Sullivan's next door.  The decor is really awesome and feels very Italian yet modern (no gaudy armless statues or cheesie fountains but rather tasteful architectural finishes all around).  Service has always been awesome. The demeanor of all our servers has always been attentive and personal. Occasionally you can get somebody who is a bit over the top on commentary but not really in an annoying way and really mostly helpful.  They are also very kid friendly and we frequently make it a dinner out for the family (2 kids 9-12).  We love Luciano's and visit with friends and family often.",

    "text": "I had probably passed by Luciano's at least 100 times since they opened.  My original reaction being \"humph, Italian\" with no real interest to try it out.  Well, as luck would have it, a friend arranged a girl's dinner at Luciano's one evening and to my surprise(!), the dark, dank, old space that used to be home to La Paz was beautifully transformed - and BONUS, the food is off the chain!  A must try: the beef carpaccio.  It is the best I have ever had.  Ever.  I don't know what it is, maybe the crunchy little capers or the truffle oil (probably both), but dang... it's THAT good.  Plus, the service is attentive and balanced...the right amount of \"5-star\" without feeling like a fool if you accidentally use the wrong utensils.  I've since visited several times and have always enjoyed - thoroughly enjoyed - the meal & the experience.  And I must add, half price bottles of wine on Wednesday's.  Trust me, Luciano's is a worth a visit.",

    "text": "Walking into Luciano's was probably the best part of my dining experience. The staff was exceptional. They were courteous, and very attentive. The ambiance and decor of this place is great. It has a serene and romantic feeling. Our group of four adults and two kids was served properly by the waiting staff. The food was a different story. Two of us ordered the Shrimp Fra Diavolo and it was just OK, nothing great. The pasta was almost over cooked. One other guest in our party ordered the Chicken picatta which turned out to be the worst of the dishes served. The sauce was flavorless and the pasta was overcooked to the point it was getting mushy. The gnocchi dish was great according to our friend. It was the perfect texture and the sauce was well balanced. Luciano's has great potential, but there's just no excuse for overcooked pasta or average sauce, in an Italian restaurant. They have the service and good vibe part down, but the food is what I look forward to. I will be willing to give them a second try.",

    "text": "We were a party of 6, 3 couples, one of them had been there before and highly recommended the restaurant. Service was excellent I will start with that, food on the other hand was very very disappointing. I had the ribeye, asked for it medium rare, they brought a piece of meat, that I am sorry to say seemed like it was cooked by a child. It was well done on the top side, and 3/4 on the bottom side, and now that I think about it, they did not bring out a rib eye, it seemed more like skirt to me. My fiancee had the lobster ravioli, the raviolis were fine but the sauce was extra salty, to the point where she was taking it off because it was unedible. A point to of view shared by the other people eating pasta. The manager was very thoughtful wishing to cook the plates for us again, but we kindly refused. I would not come here again, service was great, but someone in the kitchen needs a cooking lesson.",

Very flavorful, hot, fast service, & fresh! The wait staff were great too. They were very friendly, knew the menu well, & stayed on top of what you needed.
