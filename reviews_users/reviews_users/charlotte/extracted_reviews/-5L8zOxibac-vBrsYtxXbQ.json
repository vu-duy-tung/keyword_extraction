    "text": "Okay, so it has taken me forever to get out to this place but finally made it a few days ago. It's strange that others have some terrible reviews of this place and from what I hear around town a lot of people certainly don't speak as highly about their experiences here compared to mine.   We were here on a Wednesday which is apparently one of TWO weekly trivia events held here. The crowd was pretty large but everyone had a table and it didn't seem overcrowded. It's actually worth mentioning that we never once felt we were neglected by our server. In fact, our server offered some of the better service I've experienced in quite some time. We were always asked if we needed an another beer at the perfect time and checked on just enough times without being annoying.  The food here exceeded our expectations by quite a bit. I split the Bleu Cheese Burger and an order of chicken tenders tossed in their hottest hot sauce. As far as I'm concerned they nailed both of these orders. Apparently the burgers are all made in-house (not frozen patties from a distributor) and it certainly made a difference. Flavor of the burger and the addition of the blue cheese was great. The tenders were great as well and I don't think I'd ever recommend tenders without tossing them in some type of sauce.  As for the atmosphere, which I've heard many complain specifically about, I personally saw no problem and actually had a good experience here. It wasn't super dark like many bars of the same caliber in town, the service was great, the food was good and it wasn't super loud at any point. I'll need to pop in here on a weekend to see if the vibe is any different as I'd expect it to be vs. a Wednesday but in general very pleased with this place for a bite to eat and a few beer.  Oh! And it's worth mentioning that it looks like they have some pretty great deals on beer as well as a pretty good selection. Monday's are 1/2 of Drafts AND the same goes for Tuesdays.",

Fun, local sports bar - a real one - not the typical \"franchise / chain\" wannabe manufactured digs or phoney atmosphere.  For you sports fans, TV's are everywhere.  For you beer fans, I counted 31 tap handles.  If your nickname is \"Minnesota\", they also have pool tables!  Food was particularly good at mid-afternoon - a good sign that their kitchen stood ready during an off-hour.  Wife had a very generous portion of pulled pork - nothing really special - but it was good quality and nicely presented. Portion was plenty to eat there plus some to take home!  Fish-and-chips for me, and it was GREAT!  Had it many times in British pubs, and Ed's version was quite authentic - other than it was served on a plate vs. newspaper.  An observation - not a criticism - I will eagerly order it again next time.  My generous portion of fish was fresh, too hot to eat when served, (a very good thing) and perfectly battered and fried. Chips were also too hot to handle and perfectly crispy.  Burgers at next table also looked tempting.  My spicy - don't be shy - Bloody Mary(s) had a perfect kick!  Waitress was perky and appropriately attentive.  Mixed and comfortable crowd mostly 20/30s mixed with a few of us in the card-carrying Medicare vintage.  Crowd was enjoying the place - nobody seemed out of place regardless of age.  We originally thought the place was empty since parking is in the rear.  We will return, and I suggest you try it!",

She got the chicken tender plate, I did the mushroom Swiss burger with fries. Most entrees will run in the $9.50 - $13.00 range. I typical don't take the easy way out on reviews but everything about my visit was \"average\". No complaints on the staff, beer selection, parking, prices, etc. - The real draw for this place would be if there was a sporting event on you'd want to watch.

It pains me to write this review, but with the staffing changed I feel I have to tell Yelpers about my awful experience. I went with a group of 10 people just to have some drinks this past Friday. The specials were $5 well drinks (again, thank you Ed's), and I was having a hard core love fest with the Tatchos. My issue came when I got the bill. By accident, the bartender had put my friend's drinks on my bill. Usually no issue. However, another bartender had already charged them for their drinks and this bartender was refusing to change it. Heather, the bartender, introduced herself, and instead of thinking there was a mistake, she patronized me in front of my friends and said \"honey you didn't drink just two drinks, you had four and a beer\". For one, I had two drinks because I was the DD of the night. If you want to tell me I inhaled all of the tatchos, GUILTY as charged, but don't tell me I had more to drink than I already did. I explained to her that my bill should only be $18 instead of $50+ and she again patronized me and said \"Honey (again, what is with that word?!), I AM sober. You had more to drink\". My fiance and friends all saw my drinks, and although they tried to vouch, Heather wasn't having it. I was starting to feel crazy. I don't care if I drank the drinks, but if the exact drinks I'm over is the exact beer/cocktails that are on another tab, don't you think it might be best to at least investigate with the other bartenders and not make a customer feel lower than dirt? She made me feel like I was losing it, embarrassed me in front of my friends by the way she talked to me, and was overall a poor customer experience. I've never been treated so poorly! I asked to speak to a manager and she told me that it was too late and she already ran my card, to please sign because she was too busy to \"handle this situation\". Ed's, you have truly broke my heart. If it wasn't for your Tatchos, I would have given you one star, but that's not fair. Your staffing has changed for the worst and although Heather the bartender offered to give me \"Several drinks\" next time I came in, I doubt she would a) remember me or b) hold up a promise. Sigh.",

    "text": "The worst food poisoning of my life. Went there last night to watch the Pats vs Steelers game and bought a burger. After about two bites immediately knew something was up with it because it tasted really bad so I had the waiter throw it away after telling her. No manager was notified to my knowledge because I never had a manager come talk to me and yet still had to pay for the burger (Which I think is wrong considering I had two bites and hated it). I've been incredibly sick the past 12 hours. I've tried reaching out to the manager to make him aware twice now with no success. Keep being told he will call me but hours keep passing by with no phone call. Was trying to resolve this with the manager before posting to yelp.",

After putting my money into one of the pool tables I wasn't able to play. I put my money into another table and a ball was missing. Management did come to fix it promptly.. but my server Kelly was as stuck up as they come! I witnessed her chatting and sitting down with one table for at least 10 minutes while I waited to get her attention. When I finally did ask about my food to go she replied that I had chicken and since it's raw it takes longer to cook. Not more than 2 minutes the bartender brought out my food. She never asked how my food was or even bothered with me in general. I love this place but their staff needs improvement!!!!!!",

    "text": "So I came here last night with my boyfriend and the entire the staff of the restaurant he works at for an after holiday party drink. We had joined everyone at ten park lanes on Montford after he got off work but as they were wrapping everything up since they were closing we decided to go with everyone to Eds so that he could enjoy a little time with his coworkers and not to mention also provide a little help transporting people since everyone else had already been there and were already pretty drunk.   Well we walk in and order a round of drinks (only our 2nd drinks of the evening btw) and I told my guy I would be right back I had to use the restroom I'm just getting over this nasty cold that seems to have everyone and their mother sick so I'm in the bathroom blowing my nose for probably the 7000th time and when I walk out of the bathroom I'm greeted by a woman who was either a bartender or a manager doesn't matter and another staff member AS WELL as a bouncer! The woman standing in front asks me if I'm ok can she get me any help of any kind I'm like no I already ordered my drinks I'm fine thank you??? Really confused but oh well. She then tells me they heard me getting sick and had to make sure I was alright! Ok thats intrusive but nope not getting sick I was blowing my nose can't see how those things sound similar but ok. I walk away from them to join the party and I watch her go behind the bar and tell the bartenders to cut me off! I then turn around to see the bouncer who has decided to tell my boyfriend he has to leave and is escorting him out the BACK door!!! They told me he was too intoxicated and that he could no longer remain on the property, and I suppose he's also a bag of trash that they needed to take out seeing as how they felt the need to escort him out the back door and not ask him to walk out the front door we walked through 5 mins ago! No no no not happening I grabbed my guys arm and pulled him back in and told them we would be more than happy to walk ourselves out the door WE CAME IN and never walk back in it either.   Ok so first off neither one of us were any where even in the vicinity of being drunk it was also incredibly embarrassing for the staff to make such a scene when they were so in the wrong! Never mind the fact that they clearly wouldn't know a drunk person if they hit them in the face! The group we came in with were definitely drunk! I know I drove them there! But they were provided rounds of shots and beers upon entrance no questions asked! The one and only other time this has happened to us was a similar situation with SIP uptown we took an Uber for our first stop and first drinks of the night again told we couldn't drink somewhere because we seemed drunk already but at least SIP had the balls to make it abundantly clear it was about appearance and didn't wait for us to spend any money in their establishment first.   And now after reading over a few of the other reviews of this place it's clear this isn't their first offense and probably won't be their last. But to be clear the staff is rude and unprofessional and I highly highly suggest you take your hard earned money elsewhere to a different bar or restaurant that will treat you with respect and not judge you/embarrass you or try to take you out the back like a bag of trash. Shame on your staffs behavior Eds tavern but thank you for showing your True colors so that neither myself nor any of my other close friends ever spends a minute of our time or money with you.",

They are open late which is a plus, they have pool tables also a plus, if you like to pick your own music they have a touch tunes device there.  Decent beer selection on tap, if you're a beer snob go somewhere else.  If you like your beer served in buckets maybe this is 4.5 stars for you.  All in all Ed's is fun and the location is great, I expect their new patio will be very popular in the warmer months.",

Finally a server came by but only to pick up the check from the table before us and was more than ready to walk off without even acknowledging us. I stopped her and asked if she was our server and she finally sent over our sever. Service from there on out was better. The $5 bloody Mary's were really good, better than the average Bloody Mary special. They offer a lot of drafts betters too!

    "text": "Gave trivia night another shot at Ed's... I think last time the trivia was a bit hard and it was hard to not notice the scores of people looking up answers on their smart phones.  Luckily the phone policy has been \"reinforced\" or it seemed like it was.  Trivia should be better if you actually know the answers!  Not how well you can use your smart phone.  Anyways - I got there early and ate at the bar waiting for my friends to show up.  The barkeeps were nice and also let me change a tv to watch a different sport than they had up there.  They have a ton of tvs so it's hard to miss any sort of sports action going on.  Had the fish tacos, which were nice... I liked that the tacos were \"pre-limed\" so it had a good citrus kick to it (without having to get your fingers all limey).  Maybe it's just the laziness in me, but I appreciate when the chef/cook/kitchen says, \"this is what you are eating... you have no options\"  I think there is a boldness about it.  From there it can go either two ways - you absolutely hate what was given to you, or bask in it's greatness.  My side was the cucumber salad... which I didn't care for.... sliced cucumbers with paprika and vinegar... was a bit soggy and sad.  I did eat it all (begrudgingly) .  Trivia was fun and we even won a round of beers!  Definitely will return.",

The food is great, and they have have decent drink specials (if nothing else Coor's Light draft is always a $1.50).  The only negative I have about this place is that since they are a new restaurant they seem a little overwhelmed.  It can get really crowded, especially on game day, and the service can be really slow.    After living next to Ed's for the last several months, I will add that I think the service has gotten worse, something always seems to be wrong.  Also, because of decent drink prices, there are a lot of douche bags here on thurs-sat nights.

There is a smaller crowd there on Friday and Saturday nights. On Saturday nights they usually have a small band. The food is just above average for bar food.  They have about 10 decent size flat screen TV's but the picture quality isn't that great. They usually don't turn the sound on for games. They have a back deck/patio and a small front patio with cornhole. They have two pool tables, a few video games, and lots of checker boards. The crowd is usually mid 20's to mid 30's.  The best thing about this bar is the $1.75 coors light drafts.",

Being quite hungry & thirsty, we decided to leave & go somewhere else. I was really looking forward to a bunch of delicious hot wings and vodka drinks at Ed's today, but the staff on hand did not provide those things. I'd really hate to cross Ed's off my list, but if the service is as bad the next time as is was today I certainly will.",

While the brunch menu is quite limited, the eggs are incredible. Naturally I was eavesdropping a few weeks ago and heard the patrons behind me say that Ed's get their eggs from a local farm. You can tell. The full lunch/dinner menu is pretty good as well. My fiance says they have the best wings he's ever had. My only complaint is that we have waited FOREVER on multiple occasions. If you're in a rush, you might want to think twice. We waited over 30 minutes for our brunch last weekend when there were only a handful of tables open. I'm not sure if its a waitress issue or a kitchen issue, but we've started just sitting at the bar with our favorite waitress (tall, skinny, funny brunette)  who always seems to get our food out right and on time. Sit at the bar if you're in a hurry or don't want to deal with a messed up order.",

I heard Ed's Tavern was a staple for the Dilworth area but instead it's been a staple for lousy service, slow drink orders and average food.  Sad!  This must be the stomping grounds to the Carolina Panthers' offensive line since they have so much in common.  The only thing I can honestly say about this place is that it has a great deck.  Although at times I am hoping I pass out from heat stroke in order to avoid paying for the service I unfortunately received.  Sad!    Also, don't ask to move any tables together, it causes more trouble than it's worth.  Any person would think a server would be happy/open/willing to accommodate a group that had more coming, with the mindset it would led to higher earnings/ tips, wrong.  Instead our group got an ear full as the waitress mouthed off like a teenager at Claire's that doesn't get her way.   Truly shows the type of character they have working here.  I also must note, this is not the first time I've had bad service, it happens every time and I'm sure while you are reading this review on the Light Rail, ask the person next to you if they have experienced the same thing, I'll wait.  Told you so...    Keep the deck and fire the rest, that is the improvement I can give you Ed's Tavern.  Make it a place people from Dilworth are proud of, make it a place of good food, make it a place of good service. Make it great again.",

I think if ABC investigated this place they would find they are watering down liquor to the tenth degree! My friends and I pushed the tab until our fifth drink and realized we didn't have the slightest buzz, we mentioned it to our server and started ordering doubles hoping to utilize alcohol for its intended purpose, to no avail. Can't speak to their beer or wine but will say they are watering down their liquor 100%, so evident it's not even funny. Seriously Ed's what the hell I remember you being a decent destination? By the way Comet around the corner know how to fix an actual drink, don't waste your time with Mormon cocktails at 1.00% abv,and don't make the same mistake I did paying $50 for a few sprites they said had alcohol.",

Went inside for to ask about specials, $5 mimosas and bloody marys plus some beer specials. I ended up sticking with the bloody marys, so flavorful and spicy! Love it! What a good buy for $5, will be ordering this when I come back. They could have had a better table arrangement to fit more tables and chairs for the growing crowd, but we managed to score a small table after no more than 10 minutes of waiting. The table still had the last person's trash and check which we thought ok, no problem, the server will pick it up. But, we didn't get acknowledged for 15 minutes, not even a look or glance. The trash just sat there, till we actively flagged someone down. And even then, she clearly did not want to be there/talk to us. Our server was nice but, not very attentive. Understandable given the amount of people opting for table service on the patio. Step up the service, I get its packed but if you are going to offer table service, then do it properly, without making the customers feel like a chore. We ordered the pretzel with jalapeno beer cheese and tatchos to share, both were yummy and fairly big. Good bar food.   I would suggest getting here around 6:30-7p if you want to enjoy the patio, the upcoming summer will not be forgiving to those who sun burn easily. Parking is also tough, they have a lot in the back but it gets packed like the patio itself.",

The only reason I've kept going back is it is .4 of a mile from my house, and as long as you don't mind waiting 30 minutes to ever get acknowledge as a customer, it's not so bad.  Since the new ownership took over, and name change and re-change, the staff has been not only slower but exponentially more rude as well. Last night we waited over an hour for food, at 8PM on a Sunday, and our waitress never once checked on us. After an hour, half of our food was delivered, and then they were delivering food to other tables before bringing ours out. Once we complained for the third time, the manager came out and flat out lied that our food was being plated (the second time they told us that lie). However I could see him asking the cooks where the food was. He then proceeds to tell us their ticket machine went down. Why didn't our waitress check in ONCE over the hour wait, or have the decency to tell us that?!  To say I'll never go back, even with friends to just grab a beer, is an under statement. Ed's used to be such a bar with great food and great service, I'm not sure what exactly happened!",

From the moment we walked in I almost felt unwelcome. No one said anything to us. We walked up to the bar and the bartender was extremely rude. She took our order but was not happy about it. After we got out drinks, we were standing, watching the game because there was no room to sit. Waitresses kept walking past us, brushing us every time without saying a word. One time one of them actually hit into one of my friends and made her spill half her drink without even an apology. I was less than pleased to say the least with this experience. We quickly finished our drinks and left.   I unfortunately won't be back to Ed's Tavern any time soon.",

There's outdoor seating that's covered and patio that's not covered.  There's indoor seating as well. Something for everyone.  If it's cold out they have heaters, if it's warm they open the back bar to the back deck.  There's a TON of TV's,  There's a few games.  The food is good.  The staff is very busy but still nice.  You aren't going to get one on one service like fine dining.  It's kinda of like you should know your order when the waitress gets there (which I get if you go for game days).  We go mostly for game days but have been once when they had trivia music.  I didn't play, but helped a group behind me.  I think it's well done.  I like that it's not in uptown.  People bring their dogs to back deck.  I probably wouldn't bring my 8 year daughter here, but I see other people bring their kids.  They have games there too which is fun if you are in the mood.  I like it and I give it 5 stars for the bar food, TV's and variety of seating.",

To make matters worse, everyone's plate came out eventually except mine. It took me asking our server to check on my omelet for her to run back to the kitchen only to come back minutes later saying they had to restart cooking because they burnt the first one. My omelet came out eventually and the meal was very delicious and plentiful, even the hash browns were some of the greatest I've had but I then was disappointed to see my biscuit was very over cooked after all. As for my friends' experience, the portions were tiny and inconsistent. They won't be returning. Very disappointed because I had higher expectations for Ed's.",

We had never had any issues. Recently, a bartender over charged us and when we pointed it out politely, we were asked to leave. When we came back a few weeks later, tried to explain to a manager what happened, we were asked to leave again for \"accusing\" a bartender of overcharging, even though several of us could attest to the overcharging. Can't believe they'd turn away good and frequent customers the way they did. Especially after all of the bad press they've had and generally crappy food.

The outside patio is filled with TVs so you'll be able to catch whatever game you're interested in.  Buckets of beer are around 15 dollars and they kept the drinks coming all day long for our group of 10.  We shared about 6 appetizers between the table and everything was delicious.  The only complaint I have about this place is that parking can be difficult during game day or a big game.  I had to park in the grocery store parking lot but it's not that far away. It is also extremely loud but what do you expect on game day when everyone is there to watch! There is also a pool table available in the front.   Great service and food.  I will be back to watch more Panthers games!",

What a shame too, new to Charlotte & looking for the quintessential neighborhood bar at which we could become regulars. Nope. Both visits were weekend mornings..... The first time we were glared at by the hungover servers from behind sunglasses. They lounged in one of the booths, talking trash about their friends & scaring us out of requesting some help.  When drinks & food were finally ordered/brought....they were practically thrown on the table.  The second time we waited 15 minutes & finally went up to the bar to ask for menus. After reviewing the menus & deciding what we wanted to order, several additional minutes had passed with absolutely no attention from the staff before we finally decided to leave. Keep in mind that plenty of staff were standing around & available to help, they just weren't interested in helping us.  I went to the bar to inform them that we were leaving due to a lack of service & once the staff noticed we were irritated & getting ready to leave, they went back to the kitchen to hide & didn't come out. (I waited for several minutes)  What a shame. Great looking bar, seems like it could be a fun atmosphere, awesome location....worst service we've experienced since we moved her several months ago. We won't be back.",

Pretty much anywhere you seat, bar, high table or booth you are in a prime spot for seeing a game. And, when I say game it is because they have several on different TV's.  The Bloody's Mary's are a perfect start to the day and on to their large selection of beers, tab, bottle and even can special. I have had a few food items, pimento cheese dip, chicken fingers, wings and some eggrolls. Everything has always been on point and the service has as well.

There's a lot of local and a lot of non-local too.   The food was fairly standard bar food. I tried some of the fries and zucchini fries. The regular fries were really good. The zucchini fries were kind of mushy. You get half off an appetizer if you check in on Yelp.  I wasn't impressed with the service. I had to ask multiple times to get a water. A waiter or a manger was really pushy about trying to get us to get a mimosa tower (on a Thursday right after work no less). When we wouldn't get one, they asked if we were going to stay long acting like they wanted us to leave.   If it weren't for the service, I would come back, but I was pretty turned off by their service.",

To be honest, we were mostly in it for the outdoor seating to begin with and really didn't have high expectations for the food.  But,  we were pleasantly surprised by the entire experience.   First of all,  the deck is seating is perfect. They have everything you need out there and it's comfortable.  Our server was super nice.  We ordered a bow of chili, blackened chicken salad and blackened chicken wrap for dinner. The wrap came with fries.  Everything was really good. We have no complaints.  We enjoyed the experience and will be back,  likely with some friends to share a table.   The only issue we had was that they were doing construction on the bar by the patio and that was just really annoying/noisy....but hopefully that will be complete soon and will extend the outdoor seating area.",

The hit were the southwest egg rolls (delicious combo of dipping sauces too!) Other friends enjoyed the eggs and hash-browns (although a little over cooked to one person liking, but were a bit by another person so I guess it just depends on how you like them!), the stuffed French toast (YUM), wings, fried pickles, zucchini fries), and biscuits and gravy.      The biscuits and gravy I was told had an amazing flavor however the were just served cold. Nothing that a quick reheat couldn't have fixed. The flavor was worth the wait though!     Despite the over cooked hash browns and cold B&G, Ed's Tavern customer service could not have been any more accommodating and understanding. The staff was super friendly from the moment we walked in and made sure everything was up to standards if we had a problem with anything served. They even honored 3 check ins of 50% an appetizer for our table as opposed to saying you were only allowed one per table like some restaurants.       We walked out of this restaurant full, smiling, and oh so happy by how we were treated. We can't thank you enough for your services and we will be back. Thank you!",

The towers are impressive to say the least and definitely worth it if you have a big group and are trying to basically have a bottomless brunch/lunch! The actual vibe of Ed's is great- you can sit inside, on their porch, or on their patio. The place has a ton of TVs and is awesome for watching sports and hanging out. The part that isn't the best is their food. I've had their wings and tots before and those are pretty good! A little bit better than your standard bar food. Their brunch food however, is sub par at best, minus their Nutella French toast (that stuff is awesome). I would honestly just order lunch instead of brunch if you are going their to eat around 11 am.",

Lots of TV screens for your favorite games.  But I go there because the bartenders are easy going and like to have fun guessing who just played what song on the juke box.    In this neighborhood, unless I'm craving a burger at Big Daddy's, I actually prefer Ed's to anything on East Boulevard because it's low-key.  East Boulevard focuses too much on frills and you can't sit and relax at Big Daddy's because it's always packed.  Rightly so because the food is great and desperately needed along that strip.    But Ed's burgers are still great, the crumbly-around-the-edges kind, and appropriately salted.  Their slightly seasoned fries are addictive.  And Comet Grill is ten paces away if you're vegetarian if you prefer to dine there first and then have drinks at Ed's.  Both Ed's and Comet Grill are adjacent to the Bloom parking lot.",

The chicken tenders were not your typical crusty hunks of batter with a little bit of meat in the middle - they were very meaty with a crispy, light coating that had flavorful seasoning. They also had a pretty solid beer selection, even featuring the elusive Red Oak (which I ordered, filled to the brim of the glass). The waitress was very nice and attentive but not annoying.

I had a buffalo chicken wrap and sweet potato fries.  Drinks: excellent beer list with many options on tap.  Atmosphere: big space, good location, pool tables and outdoor areas.  Service: good service, friendly staff.  Trivia: Half the people in the place weren't really playing and rules weren't that strict so I think there were some cheaters texting friends and what not.  If you are a stickler for game-focus and rules then you should probably avoid.",

    "text": "Checked this place out last night for the first time with my gf and some friends. Carly was the bartender and I placed an order of wings and onion rings with her. She brought out the wings but the onion rings hadn't come out so I waited a few minutes thinking they were taking a bit. Eventually I walk up to the bar and ask about them and she proceeds to tell me she never put them in so I was a bit disappointed since I had been craving some onion rings. It wasn't busy! It was a Monday night and I simply ordered two things so not sure how she could have messed that up being it such and easy order! No excuse there. Then I order a gose sour ale beer on tap and she gives it to me in a 10 oz beer glass so I ask what the abv is on it and she says 6%. I'm pretty sure high gravity beers of 7% or higher are served in 10 oz glasses not gose beers. I look up the abv on the beer and it turns out it's only 5%. So not only did I miss out on 6 oz of beer but it was supposed to be $1 off local beers night and that wasn't taken off my check. So I paid almost $6 for 10 oz of beer. I close out my tab and  was nice enough to leaver her a 15% tip which she didn't deserve and go out to finish my beer on the patio and then had the decency to come back in with the 10 oz glass and return it to the bar where I politely mentioned the fact that the beer I had was actually only 5% abv and shouldn't be served in that glass for future reference. She didn't seem too happy and got an attitude with me and told me she had to serve it in that glass. Anyways I walked away and left. Then I get in the car with my buddy and he proceeds to tell me she charged him $35 for a pitcher of red oak beer which he only got 4 beers out of! He was livid but didn't mention anything to her because he had friends with us from out of town and didn't want to make a scene. That's almost $9 a beer. The purpose of pitchers are too save money not get gauged and over charged!!! I couldn't believe it. I wish he would have mentioned it to me because I would have said something for him! Outrageous. I can't believe she had the nerve to actually charge him that. Unbelievable. If you want to get crappy service, get over charged for stuff and then get hit with attitude from their employees then this place is for you! Definitely wouldn't recommend this place and we won't be visiting ever again!!",

The regulars used to be 20-somethings just looking to chill, but the crowd has gotten a lot older and in my opinion, a lot more boring. It is a nice spot to grab a drink and dinner, but it is now more of a 30 and 40-something professional bar. Trivia and Music Trivia are ok, but they take way too long between rounds and it starts really late.",

    "text": "I know this is a popular neighborhood stomping ground for some. And honestly I like the low key vibe, just chilling' kinda joints. Drinks here are affordable.  All in all not bad of a hangout.  It can get super loud when a band is playing (they should reconsider having just acoustic live music, or at least not a full drum set as an alternative to going deaf).  So why 1 star?  Well, after witnessing a beat down delivered by an employee against a patron, I honestly don't have anything good to say about this place. (This said event took place before the new year FYI)  After several bad press events last year (including a death), you would think someone would care about the reputation and image of the business.  All I know is while I was standing around near the bar, a loud commotion took place at the middle table (where the checker boards table top are). The door/bar back guy punched the guy who was sitting there in the face so hard, there were blood splattered across almost the length of that long table.  The wife was screaming. The rest of the bar male employees jumped on in and dragged this one guy out to the back. Gosh knows what happened to that man.  Wife was hysterical, and she kept being yelled at by the male employees while she repeatedly said stop beating him he didnt do anything.  WTH just happened?!   Then it gets better.  The guy who did the face punching now storming back in and yelling at everyone on his way, including me and the people I was standing with, for standing around.  He yelled \"this is not your f-king living room, get the f out of the way\". Hmm... This is a bar, people stand around in a bar.  Am I the delusional one?    So I could only guessed that he punched someone because that someone was in his way, didn't move and might have mouthed back. My thing is, if you don't like dealing with people, especially intoxicated people, don't work at a bar.  There is ZERO reason why any employee should or need to punch anyone.   Management, if you are reading, please don't hire people who have anger management issue. IT IS NOT OKAY, and ganging up on one person isn't okay either.  I go to bars to have fun and enjoy myself.  And I was quite scared and pissed off by that night event.   Maybe they can put up a sign \"Come here at your own risk...\"",

The TV's are pretty good for a bar and they usually have some kind of band on the weekends if you like live music.    The beer specials are really good.  I think Coors Light is on tap for $1.50 everyday so you definitely can't beat that.  They also have other premium beers at very reasonable prices.  I have only eaten here a time or two, mostly just go there to hang out with friends and have a few beers.    I did recently have the Spicy Roast Beef Sandwich special for $6 and I have to say it was really good.  Buttery toasted bread, warm roast beef with melted cheese and some kind of spicy sauce that was excellent.  It also came with fresh made potato chips.  I was impressed to say the least!",

However, if you're not close to the area and/or are looking to eat, there are far better places to spend your money.   My friend and I went in for a game recently. We sat down at a dirty table (it was busy and someone just left). When our waitress finally appeared we asked her to clean it. She appears moment later and thoughtlessly sprayed both of our phones in plain sight with whatever cleaner they use to wipe down the previous patron's muck. Didn't apologize, just mindlessly went about doing what I assumed she thought was someone else's job. Now, I can completely understand if a place is slammed like this one was and not getting the fastest service, but our waitress spent time hobnobbin' with her other tables like she was working at Hooters. We were there over two hours and I bet she came to the table three times (someone else brought us our food). Hey, that's not enough to give the place a bad review -- there are good and bad apples in any establishment; I'm giving these guys two stars based on the quality of the food alone. It's easy to pour a beer and that seems to be the level of competence they require in the kitchen. On par with a heat-lamp'd McDonalds' burger. Rubbery. Flavorless. Is this even real meat? My buddy got the wings. We both felt a little queasy afterwards. He doesn't care to go back, but I say trust 'em with the beer. They do have a good selection of drafts and those are reasonably priced. The atmosphere's good if you're into the sports bar vibe.",

Who ever thought it would be a good idea to mess with the Wings should be fired. This week was the 3rd time in a row that they have come out soggy and just your typical chicken wing. The hot wings are no longer hot and the crispy finish is no where to be found.  I have friends who come to town and immediately want to stop by. I can get past the lame change over to try and become a burbon bar(odd?) and the increase in drink prices but come on, the wings made this place and until they bring back the old wings it is time to look elsewhere. sorry Eds, you have been my go to for a long time, hope you come back",

I feel like its a hidden Gem of Charlotte. It's tucked away off of Park Road and Ideal Way in the Sedgefield community. Great indoor/outdoor seating as well as amazing drink specials. One my favorite things about Ed's is the Skiball amachine! SKIBALL FOR FIREBALL!",
