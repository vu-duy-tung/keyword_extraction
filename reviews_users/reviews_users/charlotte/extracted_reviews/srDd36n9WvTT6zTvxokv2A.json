As soon as you walk through the doors you hear a welcoming chorus of 'Welcome to Queen's' even before you see the workers there! The food is, in a word, INCREDIBLE!!! I have been disappointed at just about every soul food restaurant that I've went to since I moved here, EXCEPT this one. I had the smothered chicken, Macaroni & Cheese, Jerk Chicken, Yams, and Homemade Mashed Potatoes and Gravy with Red Velvet for dessert. Everything was just wonderful; well seasoned but no overkill of any one season, not oily, under or overcooked. The owner was very friendly as well; he was the one that wrung me up and even gave me a pound after asking if this was my first time here. Just an all around great place; well worth hard-earned the money I spent.",

For sides I got macaroni and cheese (tasted like grandmas), cabbage (perfectly cooked) and mashed potatoes (taste like actual mashed potatoes no instant mix!)

We heard from a friend that they were open thanksgiving. We did not have a hotel with a kitchen so obviously we needed to buy out. They had the friendliest welcome, made us laugh and feel comfortable. Their food deals are well worth it since they fill you up and you'll even have leftovers if you buy the large plate. The food was amazing ! It hard to go to just any \" soul food spot \" but this one was great ! The cornbread was a little hard and dry but the rice was pretty good my boyfriend had meat loaf, jerk chicken, collars greens and mac and cheese. He was in heaven and it met his expectations. I had jerk chicken, ham, rice with gravy, and mac and cheese. It was so good we went a second time before leaving. Instead, we shared a large plate. My boyfriend got the whiting fish (a huge one at that !) and the regular sides. Their lemonade was perfect !! I had about 3-4 cups I would def be stopping back once I visit again. I did not get the young mans name but he was super nice and very polite. They noticed us since we stopped by for he holiday which we felt welcome once again. I def recommend this place !",

The place looks run down in the inside.  But I didn't want judge based upon the inside because some of the best food are in a hole in the wall.  So I ended up taking a 2 wing plate to go.... and I got Mac and cheese, and collard greens as my side. Once I got home...I was excited to try the food.  And I was so disappointed.  The mac and cheese was so nasty that I almost vomited while tasting it.  The collard greens was okay. And the chicken lacked any type of seasoning.  Needless to say.... I ended up having to get food from somewhere else.   This meal was a waste of my money.  And I will never be back here. Just gross!",

Although this is my first time writing a review on this restaurant after visiting several times, I was a little disappointed recently when I stopped on my way home from work.  It appears that if you come too late (or right before they close), you'll likely get what's left over unless you order a meat that has to be prepared upon request, like a kind of fish.  I guess it's a hit or miss, depending on when you go and what you prefer.  However, there are plenty selections and I can't seem to find a better soul food spot in the area that competes with this one?",

This is the best soul food restaurant that I have been to in Charlotte. Bland? Not at all. The food is seasoned very well, as soul food should be. Maybe it depends on the day that you go. But each time I have been it was absolutely great. The staff is awesome and the owner is accommodating. Queen's is GOOD!",

I ordered the bourbon chicken, the curry chicken, macaroni and cheese, and collard greens.   As I sat down and started eating, I realized I had made a terrible mistake.   I don't know if it's because it was so late and the food was just sitting there all day, but the food had no flavor   it took me back to one of my childhood rap songs by Sugarhill Gang, \" the macaroni soggy the peas are smushed and the chicken taste like wood.  And baby Bubba I did not recommend this place!!!!!!!!!",

It is cafeteria style i.e. you have to bus a tray around, but the food is delicious.  The place is not a high end restaurant with waiters, elegant decore, and soft music.  However, what they lack in asthetics they more than compensate in the deliciousness of their food.  If good food is your focus this place is a must!",

We ended up ordering a three Veg plate, which included mac & cheese, greens and yams. The food was overall a five out of 10. The mac & cheese was so so , The greens had too much vinegar  and the yams were so so too.   What really bothered me was I paid seven dollars for Soso food and small portions with no meat.  The container was small size not your regular size to go container.   Only one small cornbread muffin instead of two.  The portions were dished from a small scoop, and practically leveled off.  In summary trust the yelp reviews, I cannot recommend this to the rest of my group.   I hope Queen reads their reviews and make some changes because I want to see black businesses succeed.",

The fried okra was not seasoned, at all. The corn muffin looked gross, didn't even try it. I fed it to the ducks at freedom park. The tilapia was half decent, again, it wasn't seasoned though! Very bland. The mashed potatoes and gravy weren't only thing I finished. They were honestly the only thing half way edible. I'm from the north and was really looking forward to southern soul food.

Server and manager came through the dining area to welcome customers and recognized new faces and actually held a conversation beyond the typical \"manager check\".

    "text": "I am sooo trying to figure out what food everyone else on Yelp was eating at this restaurant  because they were not serving it last night.    Honey...where do I begin.  Okay, so the place is pretty clean.  However, apparently during the day with all the serving the covers for the food containers had become covered in food and were not being regularly cleaned so that looked disgusting.  The ladies behind the counter were pleasant and attentive.    We ordered one small plate and one large plate.  For the small plate we ordered fried chicken, double fries, and it came with cornbread.  The chicken flavor was average at best.  The breast was dry from sitting on the steam table for way to long (or from being over cooked).  The fries were fries, but it wasn't a double order, which is what we ordered.  If that was a double order then they must give exactly 7 fries for a regular order.   The cornbread just isn't right.  Yucky!  The flavor is trying to do something but is failing.  SMH!  The big plate was tilapia, shrimp, Lima beans, collard greens, fried okra, and that nasty cornbread.  The tilapia and shrimp (and my sons fries) were made to order which is good to do.    The shrimp had a good flavor but I was only given four.  The menu shows eight was to be given.  I didn't realize this until we got home and opened the container.  The tilapia breading had no flavor!  WTH?!!  Hot mess!  Just use the same breading as on the shrimp if you can't come up with anything else.   The Lima beans were ok as were the collards.  The okra was ok as well.  The portion sizes on the sides were way to small.  So many comments were about portion sizes being big....what happened last night?  It was exactly the opposite. Ok, tired of typing.  But I've got to tell you about this red velvet cake before I finish.  The cake itself was pretty good, but these people had the audacity to use some sort of bootleg icing on it.  Tasted like birthday cake icing.  How are you gonna mess up the cake and use crappy icing?    This place should hire a new chef.  Hire somebody's grandma from Alabama, Mississippi, or the like.  I would highly recommend not going to this place.",

I was sure that it was owned by a local family but come to find out it was owned by a gentleman who used to be good friends with Queen Latifah's grandmother.. hence the name Queen.. I'll put it to you this way. This place was so amazing I went back for seconds the day I was leaving town to fly back to KY. They had the best fried chicken and their side fixins were top notch. I personally couldn't get away from the black eyed peas and macaroni and cheese but they had everything from collard greens to fried okra to mashed potatoes. They had it all. The cornbread was perfection as well. The people that work there were absolutely delightful both days I went. They play 70s/80s funk and Motown hits and for those of you that know me... those are my jams and what I grew up with quite a bit. Great experience all the way around.",

I got a large plate (2 meats, 3 sides, cornbread/roll, and drink for $12.99) with fried chicken, bourbon chicken, macaroni & cheese, collard greens, and mashed potatoes with gravy. The collard greens were sweet which was different to me. The atmosphere could have been better. One employee walked through the dining room talking on her phone extremely loudly while we were eating. The banana pudding was just like any other banana pudding, not home made and mediocre. The sweet tea was pretty good. Don't think my family will be back.",

The bourbon chicken was good but I realize the bourbon is only on the skin which I don't eat unless it's fried.  Cabbage was delicious and so was the cornbread.  I added my own raw honey and sweet n spicy bbq sauce as condiments.  Mash potatoes today were a little lumpy but not bad and mac n cheese was fine.  Good value for the money and includes a drink.  There's a wide array of desserts.  I usually get the pecan pie.",

I had baked chicken with rice and gravy collard greens and corn bread. It was good, especially the collard greens, but the gravy on the rice was completely tasteless and the cornbread was yucky. I didn't like the taste of that at all. Overall it was a pretty good experience, but not sure I'd go back.",

    "text": "We came across this restaurant by accident and the sign outside intrigued me. So we decided to have lunch here. We ordered the small lunch: 1 meat, 2 sides, bread or a roll and a drink. Large was 2 meats, 3 sides etc. The small lunch cost $9.50 and the large lunch costs: $12.99  Dishes included  varieties of chicken, pork, fried fish  choices and a multitude of sides to includes lots of vegetable dishes as well as their famous  mac and cheese. The every day  daily special was oxtail. I ordered bbq chicken, lima beans and coleslaw. My dining mate ordered jerk chicken, cooked cabbage and lima beans. We both got the cornbread. We choose water as our beverage but tea, lemonade and soda available. The menu also features cake,  cobbler, pudding and pie for dessert. A friendly lady dished out our choices which we brought to the table. Portions were good, served on melamine type plates  with flat ware. Just homestyle cooking. All  very good but nothing extraordinary with what we ordered. Our chicken was moist and tasty, as were our sides. The cornbread was moist very unnatural yellow and I think they must add  either an egg shade food color to the recipe or use a commercial mix. The restaurant was clean but needs a brighter upgrade. We would probably eat here again.",

They make the best yams and collard greens. The food is always so fresh and hot. The owner is always there and he is always so nice to all of his customers. He greets everyone when he's out. One of the nicest people. I will forever love coming here for takeout. The prices are great too. I'm going to try some dessert next time.  Update: it's still my favorite!!!!",

Ive had the jerk chicken, bourbon chicken, fried chicken, yams, greens, cabbage, green  beams, corn bread, and macaroni and cheese. All the sides were prepared using seasoning and vegetable stock. I subtracted a star because the second time I went the food wasn't seasoned the same. Consistency is important. My second visit was during the night shift during the week. My first visit was right after lunch. There was a difference, even the corn bread tasted different. I tried the banana pudding, which was really good. We will return and I will try something different next time. Everything is really good.",

I had a large plate: meatloaf, tangy soft and delicious. The jerk chicken was my favorite with just the right amount of kick, and so tender it was falling off the bone. The yams were sweet and soft, macaroni and cheese was cheezy, buttery bliss, and rice with brown gravy. Oh and their corn muffins?! I could eat a plate of them. Seriously. The food wasn't overly spiced, which if you bring your kids, is a great thing, but it still had plenty of flavor and was cooked to perfection. He owner was so friendly, he came out to ask us about our meal and apparently remembers my hubby from 10 years ago when he came in while it was still an Asian buffet. I'm from GA born and raised, and for those of us that love good home cooking and can't find the time to make it, this is the perfect place. I plan on stopping by today. I had leftovers for breakfast... Yes it's that good. Next time though I will go with a small plate, because the large was enough for two meals.",

I love, love, love soul food, but this is not soul food. I ordered the bourbon chicken, mac & cheese & collards. Everything was so bland & disappointing. I wanted to like it so bad, but couldn't eat it after 3 bites. The cornbread & sweet tea was very delicious, I was so excited to taste everything, but the disappointment infuriated me. I couldn't believe I wasted $9 on subpar food. Nonetheless the customer service was fantastic. They're all very nice & friendly, but the owners could definitely invest in a new recipe.
