    "text": "I have been to this place twice so far.  The atmosphere really does feel like California (in my opinion).  The first time I sat at the bar and had the bucatini - which was amazing.  Another amazing feature:  wine on tap!  Oh yes.    During my second experience, I went during the day and service was definitely lacking.  Our server disappeared for 20 minutes at a time.  As they say, when things are slow, servers sometimes slack off.  Even the people behind me were complaining about the service.  However, the $10 bottomless mimosas made up for this.  I had a pizza, which I did not really like.  It was a bit salty and it had sundried tomatoes on it - which I detest - and this was not mentioned on the menu.  Everyone else in my party really enjoyed their food.  Wine list is great.  Menu is great.  Atmosphere is great.  Not much else to say.  I will be back at some point.",

They remade it with salmon and it was burned.  I had the quiche and it was cold and had a weird texture and just too thick - like I was eating a giant slab of bread.  Another trip I made the mistake of ordering the croque madame .  Let's just say it was deli ham from food lion on stale bread.  The portion was overwhelming and not appetizing in the least.  The third or fourth times we went were so unimpressive that I called it quits. Mostly what amazes me is this place is owned by the Pump House people and I love, love , love the Pump House.  Not only is the setting gorgeous but food there impeccable.",

Olaf did a great job for service. Try them out for sure.",

I'd be willing to look past all of that, however the way they handled a problem showed a real lack of concern for customer satisfaction that will keep me from returning. I made the bartender aware that I discovered, after I was well into my pizza, there were two paper receipts along with the parchment paper under it (no BS). The manager came over and made a joke about the \"extra ingredients\" but never apologized nor offered to adjust the bill to appease me. It's not about the money per se but I believe the way businesses address problems when they occur (because mistakes do happen) is the perfect opportunity to build customer loyalty. Unfortunately these folks completely missed it.",

I love the remodeling and the water glasses are hammered metal. It keeps your water nice and cold without ice! It's a very modern farmhouse look. I really like it.  The food and atmosphere are a major upgrade from the former Providence Cafe.  This is what to get:  ALWAYS, I don't care if you are just here for a work lunch, start with the grilled oysters on the half shell. These things are buttery (ohh yeah) garlicky, and with a hint of cheese.  They are incredible.   The mozzarella stuffed meat balls are also money.  Here I go again-feel free to mock me as a salad eater but they have the best entree salads.  I love the seafood Cobb with crab (and lots of it), pancetta, avocado and goat cheese.  It is so flavorful.  The grilled shrimp salad is also incredible with its little crispy onions.  These are flavor packed salads that will fill you up and make you smile.   Another things I like is that they infuse a lot of their own liquors.  I had a delicious black cherry bourbon on the rocks that was incredible.   I noticed on their brunch menu that they offer chicken and waffles.  Ok maybe now I can convince my husband to go to next weekend!",

Hello Jamaar,   I wanted to let you know about the wonderful experience my friends and I received at your restaurant the other weekend.  We chose Napa for my birthday dinner and it was such a delight.    We had reservations and naturally, there were several members of the party that were running a few minutes late.  We early arrivers decided to wait and have a drink at the bar while the others were arriving. While there, John was a gracious bartender and so attentive.  He brought out a lovely cheese plate. I mentioned that we had not ordered the cheese plate and he stated that it was complimentary.  Minutes later, he brought out an oyster plate.  I asked him if he knew that we were dining because of my birthday and he replied, \"No.\" I told him how appreciative and thankful we were even without knowing it was my special night.        What great service!  I simply want to applaud your staff for a fantastic evening.  The dinner after our bar experience went just as well.",

Son's braised short ribs and daughters spaghetti were solid. My steak, while over cooked, had great flavor.  Definitely a must to go back sooner than later.",

The first time I went I ordered one of their flatbread pizzas and shared it with a friend as a meal -it was filling without being too heavy and good to the last piece! The second time I went I shared 4 different appetizers with a friend (neither of us ate lunch that day and were starving). We loved everything we ordered, especially the shrimp gnocchi and oysters on the half shell; we pretty much licked our plates clean. I sat at the bar both times and received excellent service from the bartenders.  Napa gets my vote as a great place to have a girls' night!    I've heard they have an excellent brunch, I'll be giving that a try next & may be upping my rating to 5 stars!",

The decor and the ambiance of the restaurant was great. It would be perfect for a date night. We sat in front of the kitchen and it wasn't loud or distracting at all. Our server, Emily was great. She gave us suggestions on the wine and wasn't too overwhelming checking in on us.   We each got different meals which was good because we got to try each other's and let me tell you, nothing was a disappointment. The meal came with a glass of wine (PLUS!) I ordered the mussels-they were decent..a good amount for one person, she got the roasted beet salad. For our entrees I ordered the grilled hanger steak and it was cooked perfectly. It came on top of a bed of saffron risotto. It was good, but a bit too salty for me, which was fine because I could give the leftovers to my salt-loving boyfriend. My friend got the smoked chicken florentine which came with spinach gnocchi and sundried tomatoes. It was delicious. For dessert I got the chocolate lasagna (pretty much a chocolate torte) and she got the blackberry shortcake. It was superb.   I will definitely be back to visit this place, the servers were sweet, there wasn't a wait, and the food was great.",

Sooooo, with that being said, I missed the happy hour that I wish I had known existed! Next time though... next time... yes, I would recommend dining at Napa again. The venue was cute and I liked the nice touches throughout the restaurant and decor. They have copper mugs for the water. Very cute. Call me simple but I like that. LOL. It reminded me of how some places make moscow mules in copper mugs.   Anyway, they were hosting a community group in the bar and patio area so it was really loud in the back where we were seated initially, but they accommodated our request and moved us to the front room which blocked out most of the noise. If you read this review and still don't order the Clam Linguini, shame on you. It was absolutely delicious! It wasn't heavy like pasta dishes can be and it was perfectly prepared and seasoned. I remember reading on the menu that there was sausage in it but let me tell you... it's house-made sausage and I would have the chef over to make it at MY house anytime. It was that good! True story, one of my friends had already eaten dinner before meeting us (don't ask me why!) and after just one bite of my food she straight up asked for an order of her own. Yup, she kept on eating (well she had half of it boxed to go) but still. My point is that it was yummy! Two thumbs up for Napa.",

They make their bread fresh in house and their pomegranate butter is good, though a little too sweet for my taste. All of their brunch menu looked amazing. I went with the short rib benedict and it didn't disappoint. The service was above average for a Charlotte restaurant, but I wouldn't say top tier. I felt like the server was going through the motions; little robotic. This place caters to the Myers Park crowd.",

Though we arrived 15 minutes early the gracious hostess in the white dress saw us to our table immediately (more on her later).     Kevin our server did a great job in terms of seeing to my date's dietary needs of being gluten free and vegan.  That didn't stop me from enjoying the phenomenal bread and pomegranate-infused butter spread.  (I love gluten)   The mozzarella stuffed meatballs were excellent as was my wife's salad (hats off to our server providing a wide assortment of alternative dressings for her.)      For the main course I really enjoyed the chicken papperdelle with mixed veggies while my wife had the salmon. Her salmon was perfectly cooked and the cous cous and corn pureed subbed out for a bed of veggies was perfectly seasoned and cooked. My dish had a solid ratio of pasta to chicken to veggies in a delightful medley pleasing to the palate.    Wife and I did the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and was equivalent with the Capital Grille's own version of it (the gold standard in our opinion). A very delicious conclusion to our evening.      Throughout the evening I had a clear view of the kitchen along with the primary waitstaff station.  It was refreshing g to see a staff that communicated so well together and worked as a team in taking care of their patrons.  The sweet hostess in the white dress even pitched in to help move plates as the situation required (I'm guessing she was a relative of the owner?) & seemed genuinely interested in our dinning experience. Having worked in the industry for close to a decade I can't stress how helpful it is to have hostesses who will pitch in when the situation calls for.  Way to go lady.  Bravo!     After many subpar experiences at other upscale establishments during other Queen's Feasts, I can honestly say that we were very impressed with everything at Napa and are very much looking forward to a return visit in the near future.",

They brought complimentary apple breakfast bread which I would love to have the recipe for because it  was amazing. Lightly sweet and moist.   I ordered the chicken and waffles because I am a sucker for chicken and waffles. It was incredible! I loved the savory waffle combined with the sweet and spicy maple syrup.   My friend ordered the fig and prosciutto pizza. I sampled it and it was as delicious as it sounds. My other friend had the hangar steak and eggs. I didn't try it, but he had no complaints.   For $15, you get bottomless mimosas which is an absolute must for any proper brunch.   All in all, a really excellent time. Will return again.",

Very large portion of pasta with several meatballs. The meatballs were on the soggy side, and not very tasty. Will certainly try it again at some point and explore the menu, but when in that area my first choice will be Zio, which is about 200 yards away.",

I'm not overly impressed with the food as there's nothing that stands out taste-wise. But it's not bad - 3.5 stars. They have a new fall menu supposedly, so you may be able to try something different. The bourbon apples on the squash pizza was a good mix of sweet and bourbon. The pots-de-creme was also a delicious dish overall, but needed more of it on the plate!  The mixed drinks are pricey but good and the beers are reasonably priced for the setting and atmosphere. The service we received from the staff supervisor who waited on us during a non-busy Saturday evening was excellent - 4+ stars. Answered all of our questions, made honest suggestions, and overall helpful. I'd return for another nice evening for date night or dinner with friends.",

He suggested a tuna appetizer and then served us our bottle of wine while we pondered. He then left. Think he was elsewhere in the restaurant.We then flagged a bartender( female) down and ask if we could order. She was less than enthusiastic to say the least. When we ordered the tuna, she quickly said\"we're out\". She very rude and condescending. We then ordered a couple of different things, ate quickly and attempted once again to find someone to close out.  We were never asked how our food was, offered to pour our wine etc.... Too many great options we have experienced elsewhere in Charlotte, will not return to this one.",

She was very understanding that it took us so long to order and kept coming back to refill our water bottles. The medieval looking goblets made the ambiance feel semi fancy.  The decor was upscale. You can see the chefs cooking in the open kitchen which was cool. However, the food was not anything special although I cleaned my plate. I got the crab benedict special. The way it was described made me think it was a on a crab cake. It was just an English muffin with crab meat on top. Meh. Everyone else's food looked really good. When I come back, I'll try one of their staple menu items. Overall, nice restaurant with great service. Solid 3.5 stars.",

The avacado spread was dark green (yuck factor 10) and only covered half os a single piece of toast. I could not taste the avacado at all. They did replace the poached eggs with perfectly cooked ones. Now i could eat 1 hour after arriving at the restaurant.

Very cool copper 'mugs' for water - kept the water cold without ice. We had both wine from the 'tap' and also by the bottle.  There is truth to some of the reviews that note the expensive wine - it's not a place to go drink on the cheap, but I'm not sure I would expect to, going to a restaurant whose name features one of the most famous grape growing regions... We had the meatball appetizer, which was delicious on the ricotta polenta cakes. For dinner I had the poulet rouge, some 'rare' chicken dish. I'm not a dark meat fan so I wasn't crazy about the leg, but the breast was well seasoned and well cooked. The vegetables that came with it were delicious as well. Everyone else enjoyed their plates (the duck, the fish of the day, and the pierced pasta). Roy, our server, was very knowledgable and considerate, and made sure to take care of us in every way possible. We will definitely be returning!",

What a great experience from the service to the drinks and then the food.   Ordered the blueberry French Toast, a fried had the chicken & waffles. The French toast was cooked extremely well and they accommodated having my eggs scrambled instead of poached. My friend had an issue with his chicken/waffles coming out cold which Napa quickly recooked. Unfortunately, on the recook the chicken was overcooked and hard which Napa removed from the bill and was again accommodating in wanting to serve us something else.  Overall, great experience and I look forward to trying Napa for dinner and hosting many brunches with friends in the near future. A++ from start to finish even accounting for the chicken/waffles.

It was my fathers big 60 so we started his day with a meal before our adventitious planned day. Despite making a reservation and arriving on time the staff didn't seemed equips to handle us. They were scrambling to set up everything and figure out the details. Everyone in my party wanted expresso (latte or cappuccino).  The expresso machine was turned off the previous night as mentioned by the waitress and for some reason it was taking a long time to turn on. So after 45 minutes she noted it was still wasn't on and we could get coffee so we did.  The food was just okay. I had the French toast and it was topped with bacon. They already put the syrup on the French toast so it was super soggy. It was suppose to have some bananas on it and there was literally one piece sprinkled on the last piece. The duck Benedict was okay nothing special. The others in my party ordered the chicken and waffles which were a popular dish. They put a syrup seasoning was syrupy on the waffles. The chicken was fried in fish batter with some kind of corn meal and the oil or grease wasn't good and it left everyone in my party that ate that dish sick. We hung around and talked but, before even leaving the place everyone who had the chicken and waffles were tossing the food up in the bathroom or in the parking lot. Management was informed. Choose wisely.",

Decided to head in for brunch on a Sunday and enjoy their bottomless mimosas to cap off a typical millennial weekend, and we were far from disappointed.  To start from the top; they brought out both their brunch bread which was a sweet raspberry loaf, they also brought out their typical bread with a pomegranate butter which was exceedingly scrumptious.  The mimosas were well balanced and made using an above par champagne. All you can drink for $15 is pretty reasonable as far as charlotte goes.  My friend and I decided to get the steak burger and chicken & waffles respectively. The chicken & waffles were phenomenal and frankly one of the best I've had thus far in the city. The steak burger was good, but I suspect that there are more tantalizing options on the menu (the herb frites these come with it are a different story).  Since going for brunch, I have since gone back in for their 5-7 happy hour where you can get reasonably priced drinks, and appetizers at a steal. Being sat outside on their beautiful patio with a drink and some calamari is an easy way to forget about the work day.",

We sat outside as the place was very busy for a Thursday night.  The patio was beautiful and the weather was great. We enjoyed Klinker brick old vines zinfandel during our dinner. I had the braised pork belly minus the scallions. It was delicious and the perfect size portion if you are hungry but not starving. I would definitely return for another visit. The prices are reasonable, the portions are perfect, the wine is amazing, and the customer service was beyond exceptional.",

    "text": "First time visiting Napa on Providence and I will be back again to check out their Happy Hour and their weekend Brunch.  The decor and ambiance is so inviting as you walk in you are greeted by the hostess, who seats you at the booth. We came around 5:45 PM and Happy Hour was going on full swing with live music. Will definitely be back for that.  Service was exceptional, our waiter Brandon came back to check up on us to find out how the food was as well provided feedback on the specials and the dishes to select from. Extensive wine list with so many options.   Whole team effort when it comes to staff and working cohesively. Josh, the assistant gave great recommendation on the desserts as well.  They make one mean Cosmopolitan. The first one was more pinkish than the second and they both tasted perfect. Probably, there is more than one bartender at the bar making cocktails and drinks.  Warm bread with pomegranate butter spread. Wow.   Appetizer- ordered the Mozzarella Stuffed Meatballs. Each meatball was sitting on a crispy polenta cake. Very tasty with the Pomodoro sauce.  The Berkshire Pork Osso Bucco with Israeli couscous was cream and the pork just slides off the shank. The mixture with the diced butternut squash and chestnut gives the sweetness to the couscous.  My friend ordered the Braised Short Ribs with Hanger Steak. He loved it.  Ordered the Red Velvet Cake and the Gingerbread Cake- looked like a chocolate souffle with a scoop of ice cream on the side and caramel sauce. Got my sweet tooth fix and with a cup of cappuccino made my evening so memorable.",

    "text": "I've been to Napa probably 10-20 times, always been a great experience. We decided to get a baby shower catered from Napa, and honestly, I'll probably never go back again due to how rude the management (Cynthia) was to us.  We worked with a girl named Sarah, who was easy to work with. However, she kept sending us incorrect invoices. She claimed it was all corrected, but turned out it wasn't. We also emailed Sarah 24 hours prior to the event & got no response via phone or email (which in my opinion is unacceptable, yet not the end of the world). I had a feeling our order would be messed up & I was correct.   I sent my sister to pick up the order, and the staff didn't have her check anything, just sign & pay. Unfortunately both pizzas were wrong, and the pasta lacked the actual pasta portion of the dish (literally had the duck & like 4-5 pizzas of pasta). I told them I took a picture of the pasta to show the 4 pieces of pasta (gnocchi) which I'm assuming was an honest mistake, and they let me know if I wanted more I should paid for it. When I tried to explain to the chef what we received/the issue she tried to help and understand but transferred me to the manager. Cynthia got on the phone & told me that since I was so difficult & no one could deal with me, she had to. Then proceeded to say I received what I paid for & if there was an issue, I should have checked when I picked it up. Then also told me I've clearly never owned a business before & continued to yell at me. I had multiple people listen to the rude things Cynthia screamed at me & asked me to hang up due to how inappropriate and rude she was because we could order food from anywhere else. The guests of my party offered to order food to not deal with how disrespectful the restaurant was to us. Cynthia eventually offered to remake the pizzas, but I'd have to come get them (mid-event) which I couldn't do. Then told me that was my own problem at that point.   At the end of the call I didn't feel like being yelled at by Cynthia & decided to end the call and ask for the manager. She specifically asked for my full name but refused to give me hers. Wouldn't give me a number of her manager but said to call the main line & didn't know when she'd be in. I understand mistakes happen & things get messed up, but it's all about how to handle these situations. Napa, more specifically, Cynthia was completely inappropriate, and they should be embarrassed of the behavior she portrayed today.",

    "text": "This place is very busy and I highly suggest making reservations on the weekend. Lastnight was my 3rd visit here and this visit was a mother & wives night out to WINE  I mean whine down (or do I ).   We arrived about 5 minutes before our 7pm reservation and the parking lot was jammed pack. People were parking in the bank drive through across the street which we almost resulted to unknowing if we would be towed or not (very unsure still m), however I did two more laps around the block and parking lot only to luck up on a front door space as there was a groups of women leaving. We entered and the hostesses were very welcoming and complimented me on my shirt and escorted us to our table which was sitting RIGHT out in the forefront of the floor where everyone who comes in and out of the dining area would walk pass us. We immediately made mention that we prefer a booth and she moved us to the booth about 3 booths in which was perfect for our girls night out.  Our eyes went straight to the wine list and our friendly and honest server Andrew drew our attention to the Matchbook Tempura that is served on a carafe. He provided us a taste of it and we were very pleased and asked for the large carafe. For appetizers we ordered the meatballs (the other ladies eat pork and such so they had this item, I'm a pescatarian) , mussels and calamari. Meatballs - The ladies were almost licking the plate as they said it was extremely tasty and they were SOLD on this restaurant as they hadn't been here before. Calamari - Extremely tasty the crust was seasoned to perfection and the peppers crispy was a perfect compliment not to mention the dipping sauce. Mussels - This item came out extremely cold initially which was very unpleasant and it took us a good while to get our server attention to send it back for a hot order. He was very busy and as I mentioned earlier very friendly so nothing personal. Once we got his attention and sent the mussels back the manager brought out the warm ones and they were sooo good.  Problem was, since it took so long to get them sent back and then recooked our food ended up coming very very close to us getting the new set of mussels. That's NOT COOL and the manager could've made mention that our food was coming right afterwards or offered compensation for the mussels that we couldn't give much attention since they were not served with the appetizer portion of our evening.  Our main courses were also phenomenal: I had the pecan crusted Flounder which was superb  One of the ladies had the salmon and when I tell you she had nothing left over I mean it. The other lady had the second pasta on the menu which she said was unexplainable in awesomeness. We ALL LOVED our food.  This is a must do..",

On a Saturday night, this place can be a bit of a scene, especially in the bar area.  On a Wednesday night, it's a bit more tame.  I sat in the dining room and the decor was really cute.  I don't know if it's \"Napa\", but it's a lot of wine stuff that's done tastefully.  The staff there is incredibly friendly.  The waiter last night was very nice in both his service and his recommendations for food and wine.  I went with one of their Cabernet wines on tap, which was pretty good.  There are three sizes, so you can either order a large carafe, a large glass or a small one...perfect for those who are non-committal and just want a taste, or to those looking to drink a while.  The food here is really great.  I've had the cheese plate in the past, and the meatballs are yummy.  Last night, all three dishes were winners.  The Napa Salad has a bit of citrus, pancetta, and a few other fun ingredients.  Score one for the waiter and the kitchen for splitting the salad in the back so I didn't have to!  Next was the short rib ravioli.  It was a very hearty meal of about 5 large raviolis, and they don't skimp on the short rim filling!  Last was the duck two ways.  That and the risotto were both cooked perfectly.  This place is nice, and the prices they charge appropriately reflect the quality you receive.  I don't know if I'll be back here 8 times, but it's going on two of my restaurant lists:  1. Repeats, and 2. Recommendations for others.  Napa on Providence is such a versatile place.  I would totally take my parents here if they were in town, or meet the girls for drinks, or meet a date here for either a small pour or a large carafe depending on how much I like him.",

They offer bottomless mimosas for $16 but my husband went with just one and my friend and I, a glass of the sparkling rose which they filled to the very top which I appreciate. Mine had something floating in it but not sure what it was (foil or bug?) so I just asked for another glass. Got one, no problem. When you are the first to arrive, you get the fresh bottle! No flat bubbles for me, thank you.  We were brought coffee cake as a free bite.  My friend let the server pick her meal since she couldn't decide what to get. She ended up with the hash. Looked great. I had to go with chicken and waffles which comes with spicy maple syrup that is drinkable by itself. Even has extra on the side.  My husband got the smoked salmon Benedict. Everyone ate all of what was on their plate.  Tip: if you are craving bacon, get a side and they will bring you like ten pieces. Was enough for the table and then some!",

It wasn't like \"ohhh wow this is so amazing\" but it wasn't like \"I wouldn't give it a second chance\" either.   Maple leaf farm duck duo and lobster Mac and cheese are probably my two fav out of everything (we ordered the whole menu LOL). I'm not a fan of Mac & cheese but it was very good. The duck duo was worth the money.   Pros: Plenty of parking spots. Wine list is on point. (I got Hill Family Estate and Luna Vineyards). The entrees are big portion. Lovely atmosphere and decors.   Cons: despite having a reservation, we waited 20' still. The table was nowhere near ready. The entrance was confusing.  We have 2 waiters. Our first waiter (Maybe:Clint) was amazing. He was nice, attentive and thoughtful. He has good suggestions for wine.  Can't say the same about the busboy though. We were full after small plates so we only took a couple bites of our entrees. Most of us wanted to take home the rest.He took our dishes so fast without asking if we were done. Mind you that I was still in the middle of eating my dinner. At first, I thought he was going to put the food in the box but False alarm. He threw away all of our food....",

When we parked, we didn't realize we had parked in the restaurant parking lot as we saw the sign on Providence road, not on the actual road they are on.  Would be better right in front of the front entrance of the restaurant.  Someone outside pointed us to thr right way as we looked lost walking in the dark.  The apps we started with were the mussels and risotto balls, both were excellent!  My husband had the salmon and I had the pork chop for dinner.  These also both hit the mark and were very flavorful.  I am a huge sweet person so I was very excited about their dessert offerings.  I had the red velvet cheesecake and my husband had the chocolate torte.  His just tasted like a frozen chocolate cake, nothing homemade, just blah.  The red velvet cheesecake was very disappointing, just didn't get a big taste of cheesecake and the red velvet cake part was dry.  Hate to say it but cheesecake factory has a much better one.  So Napa lost us on the dessert.  Napa overall had some great food, but they need to work on desserts, come on!!",

His recommendations and attentiveness were spot on. We started with the charcuterie plate and moved on to an entree of pork with pumpkin gnocchi for me and the duck duo for my boyfriend. The entire meal was delicious (and beautifully displayed as well!)   I would definitely recommend this restaurant and look forward to going back and trying some of the small plates. A huge shout out to Christian for making it a special and delightful experience!",

    "text": "This place has a lot of promise (and it's been around for a long while), but for my husband and me it falls way short of getting there.  The culinary style seems dated, and the dishes lack energy, finesse and interest--absolutely not Californian! I was surprised to be served a pizza that reminded me of an Apian Way box mix from the 60's, with a crust that had the texture of matzo bread (i.e. crackers).  Extremely bland--barely palatable.  My husband's gazpacho was so-so, as was his main dish (I can't recall what it was at the moment).  However, we were with two other couples who seemed to like their food! Hence the popularity of this restaurant.",

Our server greeted us with little enthusiasm never making suggestions for food nor beverages.  I ordered a glass of Roth red and my husband threw her off by his coffee order.  She seemed put out by the request of skim milk. We ordered a Duck Confi gnocchi which was well portioned and savory. It was served by a runner who was pleasant.  The stuffed meatball capollni was as tasty as a dish served by Olive Garden.  In other words disappointing! My husband's mushroom and zucchini sandwich was good.  His french fries reminded him of McDonald's fries. We were not offered dessert and when the check came we received a spark of personality from our server...too late...15% tip...",

The first time I had it it came with roasted sweet potatoes which gave it such an amazing flavor. There's also a poached egg involved which puts it on my all time favorite breakfast/brunch meals!!  The last time I ordered this it came with roasted red potatoes. It was good but not as good as good as the sweet potatoes.  My bf ordered the chicken and waffles which were seasoned to perfection. The waffle was crispy on the outside and just the right about of chewiness on the inside. Another time he ordered the short rib eggs Benedict. OMG!! Frkn amazing!!   We also shared the key lime dessert once. It was good. Would I get it again? Probably not. I don't know if it was a temperature thing or what but it was a little too warm for my taste. The cake that was layered between the key lime was very good though.   I can't wait to try there dinner one day. Their presentation is spot on for brunch so I can only imagine the presentation for dinner. We will be back.",

It was excellent and came with roasted potatoes, which were a good match for the savory eggs. I liked the bloody mary cocktails --nice salty flavor. Also liked the pumpkin bread that came as a free appetizer with the meal. We did not have dessert but I bet they are yummy.  The parking lot is over behind the building and the decor is polished wood with cool light fixtures.  You would not know from the building wall that faces Providence Rd.  I would love to try their wine list sometime and dinner too.",

Kudos to our waiter for recognizing we weren't thrilled with our dinner.  The management compensated us for our meals, which was not my intention.

    "text": "After seeing the hit-or-miss reviews about Napa, I wanted to wait a little bit to give them time to work out the kinks and get settled.  We visited on a Wednesday night, and the place was pretty full at 8 p.m.  The hostess greeted us immediately, marked our reservation and sat us at a table.  (I think booth is the way to go here since we felt a little on display at one of only four tables in the middle of all the booths.)    The structure is still the same as when it was Providence Cafe, but they've lightened the place up with cream walls.  I've sadly never been to Napa, but it had the feel of a rustic yet classy vineyard house.    It took our waitress what felt like a loooong time to get to us, and as nice as she was, her approach was a little too... awkward?  eager?  However, the food was outstanding.  The house made sourdough bread with pomegranate butter was to die for.  Is it wrong to eat butter with a spoon?  We got the cheese plate to start, and it was fine - three cheeses with some honey, marmalade, etc.  For dinner, I got the Pork Pizza, and I'm pretty sure there aren't enough adjectives to describe how delicious it was.  I'm a big fan of roasted red peppers and caramelized onions, and these were phenomenal.  The pizza crust was fresh, and I could taste just the right amount of olive oil.  Fella got the pork sliders (we're big on the pig), and he said they were even better than he expected, which is high praise coming from him.  I also have to mention their magical water glasses.  They appeared to be hammered copper/silver, and for as much water as I poured in them from the bottle they leave on the table, my glass never seemed full... and yet, I never ran out of water.  And sadly, I didn't have any wine, so I'm pretty sure that's not why I thought they were magical.  All in all, a solid experience, and we'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "First time at Napa. I sat at the bar for a glass of wine and to take out. Service was great from the beginning. The menu is limited which is a good thing - that means they can concentrate on the items listed without trying to be all things to all people. They offer small plates including some very nice looking oysters served in individual white porcelain cups. All of the plates I saw coming out of the kitchen were nicely presented. In addition, they have large plates ranging in price from $17 to $24. I chose one of the large plate selections - Poulet Rouge with roasted root vegetables.  So I will interject this: I take out a lot. Some restaurants do a good job and others don't get it. What really bugs me is a nice restaurant putting the entree in a too-large container. The food looks skimpy and it sloshes around on the way home.   The Poulet Rouge was absolutely the BEST take out meal I've enjoyed lately (and perfectly packaged in recyclable cartons.) The chicken was cooked well done. The entire outside was very crispy but the inside was not compromised. And the vegetables...... ah! I seek decent vegetables at restaurants and Napa has won my award. Perfectly cooked sweet potato, cauliflower and broccoli rabe (I know, not a root vegetable but it fit in the mix.)   I recommend Napa for sure! It's pricey but my first impression was great. Oh and by the way, as I stood to leave, the bartender apologized for not having the time to get to know me because it was busy.... that was pretty cool. I'll be back.",

    "text": "What a great place for lunch, especially in nice weather when you can eat outside, under their pretty red umbrellas.  Visiting in Charlotte to see the Billy Graham Library and chose Napa because we liked the menu online.    Very Good Decision.   Food: 4/5 We started off with the complimentary \"charcuterie\" board  that you get on your first visit, when you go to their website and sign up ahead of time. Their charcuterie is a delicious antipasto-like appetizer tray with tasting-size helpings (selections listed on the dinner menu-choose 2 of each from 4 types of cheeses and 4 types of meats), served on a wooden boat with buttered toast, a selection of olives, ground mustard, and their own version of granola. YUM!  This would be a tasty starter with wine at dinner time, too. Our server, Charlie, was very knowledgeable and helpful as we asked several questions about menu items. Warm bread came quickly, with their pink butter.   Among the selections that were chosen for main entrees, the grilled salmon Cobb salad (excellent), the grilled salmon risotto, and the stuffed meat ball bucatini, were favorites.  Service: 5/5 As mentioned above, our server was pleasant and helpful.   Facility: 4/5 The interior was clean and spacious, the patio was a very pleasant place to dine on a sunny day. There was no loud music so we were able to visit with friends without noise interfering with conversation.  Conveniently located in a suburban area. Parking is adequate on one side of the restaurant and there are a few spaces on the other side, too.   We are thinking about trying the brunch next time we are in Charlotte, or perhaps the happy hour followed by dinner.",

I met with about 25 foodies to celebrate @intensediva23's 3rd anniversary of her monthly culinary adventure \"Foodies & Fellowship\". This is her favorite restaurant and I see why.  The service was fabulous and although we got rather boisterous with laughter, they didn't try to diminish our excitement.   I ordered the crab risotto cakes with potatoes and poached eggs. I've never eaten a poached egg because...well it's runny and eewww. But I was pleasantly surprised. I think the risotto cake could've been bigger or a third cake added to the plate. I wasn't full and felt something was missing. Yes, it's small bites and I could've ordered another side, but with that many people I didn't bother. The biggest hit was the chicken and waffle. But, I wanted to try something different.  The mac-n-cheese was another hit with our group, so my next visit will be another adventure of tastebuds!",

I have been several times, and have experienced great customer service except on Monday. My friend and I arrived and sat at high top table for 3, and told him we were expecting a third. I think the waiter took that to mean we would wait for her to show up, so after about 10 minutes I finally caught his attention to tell him we would be ordering food and drink now. He seemed surprised, but really if you had asked, rather than assumed....this could have been avoided.   Anyway, the food and drinks were great and I love the atmosphere of the bar and patio area.",

Now it is exactly what it promises to be: a California Napa inspired restaurant.  The front entranceway is flanked by grapevines.  I don't remember ever seeing grapes growing in Charlotte!  Upon entering the restaurant, you are immediately surrounded by colorful abstract art, contemporary light fixtures, and natural stone work that is inviting and tasteful.   Interesting textures.    The server was efficient and friendly and by the way, had great funky hair!  The star of the show, however, was my salmon over risotto. It was so very good.  It had just enough kick and spice to make it a phenomenal dish.  I would order it again.  And again.  And again. I wish the actual piece of salmon had been just a little bit larger, as it seemed very little on the plate.  The risotto was, of course, filling.  This place knows what it is doing.  I want to return when the grapes are ripe out front so that I can pluck a few.  I have never compared a Charlotte grape to a California grape. This might be my only chance!   Three thumbs up!",

    "text": "Fantastic restaurant I had a really yummy lunch here. I thought the hanger steak was really delicious. I really really enjoyed the parsnip puree. I just love eating arugula and you get this huge pizza with bushels of arugula on it, only thing I wish it had  a little more fig spread they brought out some extra fig spread. I wish it had softer pieces of prosciutto. So I think the pizza could be improved upon but it was still really good. I usually don't order drinks at lunch but I am glad I did their rum punch is very yummy and I love the desert blueberry mascarpone cheesecake. And there were real blueberries inside the cheesecake and it sits in a house made caramel sauce and blueberry. I took some of the sauce home and it was even more delicious at room temperature and mixed together. Excellent service. My waitress was just a little sweetheart and she is so kind and she has expert time management skills as she would disappear and then reappear at the exact right moments. I'm a big Medieval Times fan and love the goblets! How unique and fun. This is a really great restaurant for a business lunch or a date. And the neighborhood is just so awesome and so adorable! If you're going to uptown afterwards you need to make a right out of the parking lot which you probably would know this if you're from Charlotte but for some reason my GPS said a left and making a left out the parking lot is not a happy time. I highly recommend coming to this restaurant.",

Best Margarita pizza around (thin crust always made to perfection and a cheese combination that is fantastically flavorful).   I don't love the water being served in their signature copper cups. Looks great but I think it makes the water taste a little off.   Good place to share appetizers and small plates or to go the traditional entree route. Menu is diverse and always pleases.   Typically not too hard to get a table and always satisfying.",

    "text": "We visited Napa recently for a long awaited girls night out. I arranged this for myself and 6 girlfriends and picked the spot I thought would make everybody happy. I made a reservation over 2 weeks ago and at that point bc my party was one greater than 6 they could only get us in at 8:30. We decided to meet at the bar early around 7:30 bc the cocktails in the past had been amazing for me and there would hopefully be a chance something would open up. I notified the hostesses that our entire party was there on arrival. The cocktail experience was so disappointing. Two of the girls in our party purchased a \"tap\" wine which was \"fizzy\" while I asked for the honey infused vodka and tonic. I was served this with soda, along with my friend and it was flat. I was still charged for a \"specialty\" cocktail equivalent to $13. Another friend got a dirty martini which was nearly all olive juice. How can you possibly even mess up a martini?  30 Min after our reservation time  , without any contact from any of the THREE hostesses at the stand, I inquired about or reservation. I was told \"the table we are waiting on just ordered dessert and we don't know how long it'll be but obviously we can't rush them.\" No offer of apps. No attempt to find another place to sit us. We then waited another 30 min. One hour past our reservation time at 9:30 pm- we were seated. After one manhattenite in my party did complain (I am not a complainer and tend to be walked on) one manager did provide us with 3 apps. She had said she would also cover some drinks. To my knowledge- one glass of wine was covered. One- after 7 of us sat there for 2 hours. I even asked the bartender and she told me it would be delivered to my table. My server did deliver it after I asked for a third time however  she was sure to charge me for that which btw was a mountain cuvee that I drink regularly that sells at total wine for just over $16/bottle and you were charging $58.  Our server Kevin was amazing. He was funny. He was knowledgeable about the menu. He did everything in his power to \"fix\" the disappointment that had evolved in the 2 previous hours.  The manager never reapproached our table. She actually was speaking about us to the bar tender after our \"rant\" session which was completely obvious and unprofessional. I made a reservation for 7 very close friends. 7 people sat hungry (it was after 10 when we finally ate dinner), tired (we are all moms of littles and this was a very very rare, much anticipated night.  We were supposed to follow the evening with dancing but none of that happened due to the late timing. 7 people were disappointed which in turn leads to 7 more people knowing of our bad experience. Word of mouth is crucial in the restaurant industry and bad experiences can truly hurt a business. I do not believe ANY of us will return unfortunately. I am shocked at the treatment we received and total negligence. In addition, I wrote this to the restaurant management and received no email back.",

Bottles of ice water and choco-chip corn bread served on table (yum!) & a warm, inviting ambience with just enough lighting.  I asked our server for suggestions and as soon as he said the duck confit eggs benedict I was sold! However, he came back to break the news it was sold out so that'll be for the next time! I went with the (suggested) short rib hash and poached eggs. There was a good portion of meat, it was tender and topped with 2 poached eggs so the mix of the eggs with the meat, potatoes, onions and red peppers was delicious! For me, there was just alittle too much grease/butter so I asked for bread (to dunk). Apparently they don't have bread pre-made so they baked it, but worth the wait! + a bloody mary= $21 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fw.tax&s=50009f7755a9a3a68db8a219a25f8de10d185e6ce5e6d705cd9746cb3fb20424\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">w.tax</a>!

I was sat in the \"private room\" off the bar, even after requesting to sit in the dining room. This particular room is very loud when it is full and there is no music, so it's just people talking louder and louder over each other. Each of our dishes came out room temperature which is just a personal pet peeve of mine. I ordered the Veal Saltimbocca and there were just bits of veal floating around on the plate. It was more of a mushroom ravioli with some veal. I would have said something, but since the service was so slow I didn't bother because I just wanted to hurry and get out of there. Towards the end of the meal, we were the last one in the room and the manager was instructing the wait staff on closing up (I think) which made us feel like we needed to rush as well. This was a completely out of character visit to Napa for me, which is why I felt compelled to leave a review. Of course I'll be back, I know it was just an off night. But hopefully some adjustments can be made to the other rooms to help with the sound and experience.",

    "text": "1 good time out of 3 times pretty bad. My second experience trumped my first! My third and last officially made this a 3 star.  The server makes the world of difference here!   3rd Time.. Clint our server listened, but didn't check to make sure the order was correct or to check if we liked it. When the entree came he was ready to pull the salad that wasn't touched due to old brown residue on the sides of each Romaine leaf. The fettuccini Alfredo pasta came out entirely wrong and had to be sent back. The pan seared flounder looked to come out right the first time, but while waiting on the other dish, they re made it, this time a wet gross fish on the plate not seared at all with any flavor. A real disappointment after waiting so long.   2nd Time.. * I got the same fettuccini Alfredo. Incredible!! Loved it!!   My first experience.. I enjoyed my dinner once it came, but 3 hrs for dinner is not ok when you've only ordered only the main dish without an entree or dessert. After eating here, with the food actually being really good.  I informed my waitress that I am a vegetarian. After a long wait my fettuccine Alfredo arrived to the table with meatballs on it. They sent it back and my friend was almost finished with her meal by the time my fettuccine Alfredo came. Unfortunately, no one apologized for the delay, or had any kind of complementary anything to hold me over. I had also ordered zucchini on the side as I wasn't having a protein. It came over cooked and so salty, it tasted like the beach in my mouth. The waitress didn't offer to bring anything else or apologize about that either.   Bread - the first one was cold, stale, and dry.  After asking the waitress if that was customary, she brought us another that came out hot & much better. The butter is a strange Pomegranate mixture. I wouldn't recommend it. Order some real butter to go along with it.  Fettuccine Alfredo - One of the best I've had, once it was done properly  zucchini - too salty, would not recommend  fish and potatoes- my friend loved her meal!  Dessert - I asked the lady to bring the check and the dessert menu in case I wanted something. She brought only the menu then I had to wait again for the check after I didn't see anything I wanted.   Hopefully it wasn't just a bad experience due to outside seating. I really wish it was better service!!",

Wait staff is professional and our waitress presented herself as such. She was kind and courteous also. Just a great little atmosphere. You just need to go try it out. The menu is creative and fresh. If you watch the show chopped your mind will wander to the last show you watched when you read the menu.For example here is a dessert: \"Chef's, today for dessert I made for you a chocolate beet cake; it is a dark chocolate ganache, whipped mascarpone, raspberry coulis with crispy beet chips; Enjoy.\"",

    "text": "My wife and I went to Napa on Providence for a friends birthday, so we went with a pretty large group. This really gave Napa the opportunity to shine from a service standpoint and they did. The water glasses were always filled, the service was pretty fast considering that we were a large group and the people.  The food was great and very well priced for what it was. Being that it was Sunday before 2:00 my wife and I ordered off of the brunch menu. She ordered the Napa Benedict, and I ordered the Herb Fried Chicken and Waffles. My wife's Benedict was amazing, the eggs were poached to perfection, and the hollandaise sauce tasted amazing. The herb fried chicken was to die for. It really was some of the best friend chicken I have had in my life. It was crunchy, moist, and very flavorful. The waffles were great as well. My only complaint was that I do not believe that there was enough syrup provided for the waffles.   Now to the one down part about the meal, the drinks. Although the drinks did taste great, they were almost your typical drinks that you can get at other Charlotte restaurants. My wife and I both started with pomegranate mimosas, they were what you would expect from a mimosa. After one I switched to a beer and had a big boss beer which comes from a brewery in Raleigh which I am very familiar with. The beer was exactly what I would expect from the beer. I have had it several times before having went to college in Raleigh. The biggest problem with the drinks though is their price. For what you get the drinks are very over priced. My beer was $7, the most I have ever seen this beer charged for anywhere else was $4, and the mimosa's were $8 a piece. Really expensive when you think that at other places in Charlotte bottomless mimosa's are $10. I know that it isn't a fancy one like a pomegranate mimosa, but still, the mimosa was not that impressive. Other drinks that were on their menu had a higher cost than the food. I under stand a great wine costing that much but the drinks that were $10 or more I just didn't understand.   Overall the experience was great and I loved the food. I am very likely to return to Napa again, but probably not likely to drink there.",

This was an awesome choice.  I've heard a few hit or miss reviews about this place so i figured I'd give it a couple months and this was a wise choice.

The ambiance is 5**** but the food and service are lacking. Patio and music are very nice for drinks or starters. We ate inside. The service was lacking, slow and not well trained. Ordered drinks when we sat down and waited way too long for the order to be filled. When it came, one of the beverages was incorrect. Ordered white wine, received red. One of the martinis was mixed incorrectly. Menu is priced reasonably, but trying to be way more than what it is advertised as. Dover sole was disappointing in portion size and some 'mystery' sauce served on the plate was unexceptional. One of the servers spilled a glass of water on my place and nearly drenched me. No offer of desert or a free beverage for the inconvenience. I'd go back for a drink on the patio with music, but will pass on any future dinner visit this year. Might try it for lunch.",

Our party of two dined during restaurant week and were surprised to obtain reservations just an our or so before our arrival.  We were immediately seated - directly across from the open kitchen - good for watching the action, but poor in the fact that there was lots of foot traffic and was somewhat loud.  The warm loaf of bread with pomegranate butter was a great starter while we perused the menu.  I simply can't resist hot bread and butter!  Appetizers included the kale salad (great portion size!) and mussles (can't beat the sauce to dip the bread into).  Entree selections included grouper and the pork chop.  Both were good portion sizes, nice and hot (nothing I hate more than food that's been sitting out), and incredibly tasty.  For dessert, we split a chocolate cake with mousse-like icing and a lemon panna cotta.  Both were in great contrast to each other, but by far my favorite was the candied lemon peel and mint syrup with the panna cotta.  Napa truly does restaurant week perfectly - not sacrificing portion size or quality for price.  I'll definitely be back!",

Being seated 5 minutes before the magical \"noon\" alcohol time on Sunday, we were anxious to get our bloody marys.  At 12:15 the waiter's asst delivered water, but still no bloody marys or my friend's coffee.  Finally got them and the bloody mary was DISAPPOINTING!!  Not remotely spicy even though the waiter's asst asked specifically if we wanted regular or spicy.  After a few sips, I just couldn't take it so I asked to have a fresh one made, this one with some spice.  The second one was slightly better, but still not good.  I ordered the eggs benedict minus ham.  It was just that, eggs benedict without ham, nothing fancy or gourmet, nothing more than I could've made at home.  My friend got the proshetta hash (some kind of diced pork tenderloin) and she said it was ok but she left hungry.  My other friend got the margherita pizza which she said was good.  I wouldn't request to go back, but would be willing to give them a second chance if a friend said she wanted to go.  Disappointing!!!",

    "text": "service was good, but myself and my date thought it was quite pricey. Two dollar signs should tell me entrees are 15 to 20 dollars. Try 28 each for the tuna and osso bucco, with no sides. Entree is just that, an entree, with a loaf of hard assed bread and honey butter that came from Food Lion. No veggies offered except for the rice both dishes were laid upon. The food itself was just OK, nothing exceptional. The building is beautiful and staff are great but I won't be rolling back. But that's just me.",

    "text": "The outside of the place is so darn California-quaint you'll think you can see the Golden Gate Bridge in the back.  A covered patio - featuring a guitarist when we went last Saturday night at 8:30pm - was packed with chatty wine-drinkers that looked so happy it seemed like were practicing for a commercial. Inside, the place is small and has a good mix of modern/spare/winery vibe. Our waitress (Shannon?) was GREAT - knowledgable, funny, casual but attendant. Go to her and tip her well. She's probably the best service person ice seen in Charlotte so far. The menu is very interesting. We had our choice of a variety of small plates, pizza, pasta, seafood, large plates, salads, etc. We chose a 6 piece charcuterie tasting which came on a beautiful slab of wood. A variety of house made cheeses along with some prosciutto, speck, bread triangles and - the best part - a few granola balls drizzled in local honey cuddling up to some glorious raspberries. Excellent. Our pizza was a short rib and Gorgonzola number but I had that vile cheese ejected and replaced with some goat cheese. Gorgonzola = ew. It was VERY flavorful. The mushrooms on it were roasted and the onions caramelized, the meat tender, the pizza part of it was thin and bubbled from their pizza oven. Delicious. Desserts were equally interesting. We had a ginger pannacotta that was as authentic as anything I ate in Japan. You don't really see hardcore ginger flavoring here and it was very good.  And that was it. Yes, we split a charcuterie board, a small pizza and a dessert and we were stuffed PLUS there were leftovers. We always guess on the bill amount, He estimated $100, I thought it would be more like $70.  It was $48 - and $22 of it was a glass of wine He had! It was hard to gauge what was ordered as it all came with such flair and big flavor that it felt like more food. :)  Next time, we will sit outside at the covered patron, alongside the grape vines (nice touch!) with the other prosciutto-eating wine drinkers and enjoy the music, the evening, the company and that amazing granola. Or we try the brunch that Shannon raved about - she went on and on about the awesome offerings which all sounded so good.  Plus, endless Mimosas are a very good thing.",

I guess when I saw mushrooms I should have thought it may have a marsala sauce or mushroom sauce but I asked for no mushrooms and it still tasted like mushrooms. It was really bad. The chicken was not fresh grilled chicken but more like it had been pulled from a rotisserie chicken. It had dark meat in it? The service was good but I just can't comprehend how you mess up a chicken and pasta dish. At a minimum, stay away from the Grilled (it was not grilled!) Chicken Fettuccine dish!",

    "text": "Nice lunch, a bit pricey.  The decor is modern and very attractive; the place attracts a mixed-age crowd for lunch and is probably so popular for dinner and socializing that its large parking lot is full most evenings. The pricing is from moderate to expensive.  Our meal began with bread accompanied by a delicious pomegranate butter. My wife's salmon caesar salad and my spaghetti entrees were tasty and attractively presented. Lunch for two plus two glasses of wine was $50; the single small meatball I added to my order of spaghetti cost an extra $3.00.  Service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. However, the waiter failed to inform us that our wines were from kegs, not bottles, a trend that is spreading across the country because it saves money for vintners and restaurants--not for diners. The sauvignon blanc my wife had was so good we would like to buy more of it but a 20 liter keg is a bit much for just the two of us. My less expensive cabernet sauvignon was OK but a bit too tannic before it had a chance to breathe for awhile. A few wines are served old-style from open bottles, while still others are served from an automated preservation and pouring system that is supposed to keep a bottle fresh for up to 60 days (perhaps my rough-edged cab came from a bottle that was on its 59th day).  There were only two negative elements, neither of which would keep us from coming back again. Indoors virtually every surface (walls, floors, windows, ceiling) is hard and reflects the overly-loud sound of the piped-in music and the chatter and clatter of the diners and staff. There is outdoor seating that is a bit quieter, though with some road noise, a choice that is of course dependent on good weather. The other criticism has to do with serving drinking water in metal goblets, which for some people can convey a slightly bitter or metallic taste that interferes with enjoying the meal and wine. Happily, even though most of the wines come from kegs or preserver/dispensers, they are served in real glasses so there is no added metal taste as with the water goblets.   Bottom line:  We look forward to coming back some day.",

The bar staff wore maroon button down shirts/khakis and the servers green button downs/khakis... again felt a little casusal. The bar area was nice, I left the colors a little light, I think if they brought in more dark tones it would make it more cozy and wine-bar like. We ordered 3 small plates: meatballs on polenta cakes, crab/lobster cakes and mozz cheese balls. The crab/lobster cakes were amazing... lots of crab/lobster and super fresh taste.. was served with some weird veggie salad thing. The fried mozz cheese was really tasty, the meatballs were eh... the polenta cakes were a little mushy and the meatballs were stuffed with mozz cheese and were ok, I wouldnt order again in lieu of trying something else.  The service was very slow... when we got our food nobody came back to check on us... after we finished eating the server cleared our plates and never brought the check, we sat a good 10 minutes before he came back. It was also hot in there... the a/c wasnt on and I dont think the heat was either... had to go outside and cool off while waiting for the check. I read some previous reviews and it appears they have taken what people said to heart - the bread is fresh baked, the mozz fresh made in house and the menu denotes where the food is comming from... the server was very knowledgeable and seemed excited about the food. I would go back again for their happy hour (5-7) but dont think I would go back for dinner.... the prices are high (7$ a beer for a local beer, I had a local beer today for $2.50 at Midwood Smokehouse) and the food was decent but there was still no wow factor.",

Hosts are always great, but servers are really hit and miss. I've actually had better, more attentive service at times when it's busy than at times when it's not, which is sort of weird.  Cocktails: fantastic. Their barrel-infused spirits are a must-try. Good mimosas and bloodys, too.  Wine: meh. There are some okay choices, but the wine list doesn't blow me away.  Food: decent. The poached eggs on the benedict have been way overdone both times I've tried it. The potatoes are awesome.  Atmosphere: stellar. The patio is especially beautiful. Can be pretty loud when they have live music.  If they upped the service and food game even just a little, I'd be here all the time.",

The Carb Cakes were very good as well as the meatballs.  My fav is the Wild Turky Pork Belly, it was so delicious.The pork belly with the apricot chutney make for a great combination. I also ordered a Cesar salad, which could have been better, but I wasn't there for the salads. For my entree, I had the Sausage Frittata which was very good as well. However, a friend ordered the French Toast and it was absolutely amazing.  Best french toast I've had.  Another friend ordered their special of the day which was a shrimp and grits with chorizo. Usually I'm not a grits fan, but this one was so good.  I wish I would have ordered that instead.   Aside from the food being really delicious, the service is what really stands out here.  I've been to many places in Charlotte and this is by far the best service I've ever had. The first time I went, we had a larger group and unfortunately some in our group were running late.  The server was incredibly accommodating and didn't make a big fuss about it at all.   The second time I went the service was just as excellent. It was my friend's birthday and she has Celiac's, which we made aware to the server.  She told us we were in luck because the chef makes really good desserts and specifically a gluten free chocolate torte. It was heavenly.  I would get it again if they offered it on their regular menu, which I'm not sure if they do or not.   Overall, amazing experience and I hope to go back for dinner.  Definitely recommend.",

The atmosphere of Napa is great, very welcoming. The staff too. Overall an excellent vibe, the only thing that is a bit odd are those water... cups? Goblets? Grails? I don't even know what to call them. It's not that they are bad - they look interesting, they are just different. The cool thing is that they give you these old-time looking glass medicine bottles so you can keep them filled yourself. I guess it's a good idea, since it's hard to see if there is any water left.  Regardless, the menu looked interesting, to match the decor, so off we went. The lunch menu on its own looked good (the ricotta gnocchi specifically was really tasty), so off we went on the brunch menu. Loved that the server suggested something, and also that the sides, in this case the potatoes, were seasoned. Too many times they go without even something as simple as a bit of salt.  On the bad side, the rest of the meal wasn't nearly as good as the potatoes. It wasn't bad, it's just that they didn't work. The frittata was essentially an egg with stuff on it, and the benedict had the flavor, but the textures just didn't work together, ending up in a mess on the plate rather than a nice bite.  Still, if you're in it for the decor and the experience - and that gnocchi - definitely a great stop.",

On the day I visited, they played live music and it seems like there was a private party going on. Decided to sit inside and it was nicely decorated inside as well. Ordered two pasta dishes and calamari. The calamari seasoning was so good! I enjoyed a lot and it was crispy. Definitely I will order it again. I also liked my little neck clam linguine in a white wine sauce. The meatball bucatini was okay. Their average price of their dishes might be a bit higher than other places. It will be a good idea to check their happy hours next time.",

    "text": "This is one of the most solid choices in Myers Park. Interior feels like a French kitchen. Lovely outdoor seating also. Napa is also great for groups that need private dining rooms. I selected it for my firm's Christmas party last year and they did a great job. Atmosphere is good for both business lunches and date night, because it is cozy and quiet. It's just a relaxing place.   The bar is comfortable and the bartenders are friendly. Pours are generous usually.   The food itself is excellent. Best quiche in Charlotte. I don't even like quiche but get the quiche special here all the time. The pizzas are amazing.  Overall, as an easy and reliable go to, this is easily in my top five or six in Charlotte. It's never let me down and I always enjoy it.   The only negative is that parking can be a hassle and you basically can't turn left out of the street Napa is on, so it's inconvenient if you need to return to SouthPark or points south after you eat. Minor issue.",

I've probably tried everything on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. My favs are the short rib Benedict and the duck confit Benedict! Both will leave you wanting more and those potatoes on the side are perfectly seasoned and roasted sooo good. There lunch and dinner menus are really good too but who doesn't enjoy a good brunch on the weekend. They use to have bottomless mimosas which would have to sitting there for hours literally but now they do $16 for a carafe and it's still so worth it because you will feel it after the first one and you can get at minimum 4/5 out of the carafe.  I've been here too many times to remember but I do remember each server I've had because they all have been wonderful. Whoever does the hiring keep it up because I have yet to have a server with the slightest of an attitude or anything, they are always smiling and eager to take your order and make sure everything is going good. They have lots of seating and on a nice day I always opt for the patio! They also have some nice rooms to hold events as well.",

I booked the Oakville room. It was set up just as if requested. Because of the number in my party, we had a limited menu when he was perfectly fine. They even printed personalized brunch menus just as I'd requested. Everything was cooked perfectly. I couldn't have chosen a better location! And in the future I'll be sure to do business with them again! Now to the food, I ordered the chicken and waffles. It was great. The waffles were fluffy. My chicken was seasoned well. And the mimosas were on and popping. My sister ordered the steak and she loved every bit of it! Every item excluding the vegetable frittata was ordered and there were NO complaints about any of the food. They servers were very attentive. The entire staff was great! Thank you for everything Napa On Providence! I'd give 10 stars if I could!",

The food was really just ok- the menu is very small and very generic. It basically is Providence Cafe with a makeover and not a very good one.   We ordered The Pork Belly with ginger slaw and that was ok the Pork could've been crisper on the outside and the slaw was with like a sweet and sour sauce but overall not bad. We also had the Pulled pork pizza and that was alright lacking in flavor and a little chewy. Then had the Bucatini and that was good and we also had the steak special and I liked my steak it was cooked to the right temp and had good flavoring the Fries they served it with were NOT good they were chewy and cold like they were cooked and hour before and just left on the side. We had ordered some of the sides my favorite being the Mac N Cheese it was delicious!!    I wont say I wont be back but I really have no real reason to go here other than the Mac N Cheese so we will see...",

Only 5 tables in the back and you feel like you're at the kids table back there.  No ambiance whatsoever.   We started with a carpaccio and the description on the menus says 'mustard greens, pickled red onions, overnight tomatoes, horseradish cream, toasted ciabatta, crispy capers'.  Well, there were no capers or red onions and worst of all the meat was brown.  Strike 1.  Next I had a hanger steak and braised short rib entree while my wife had beef tenderloin.  They were both disappointing.  The hanger steak was OK, the short rib was tasteless.  Strike 2.  Cubed sweet potato was underneath it.  Really, cook a sweet potato and dice it up...blah. Strike 3.  My wife had risotto under her tough tenderloin.  The risotto was watery.  The descriptions on the menu sounded really good but the results were no where close.  Need I say more?",

After we decided to cancel our ressy at The Palm  ( our usual Charlotte spot due to a family tradition ) we opted for something a little more casual. Well, Napa is an upscale dining establishment with a serious wine list, a wonderful menu that caters to several different dietary restrictions and an ambience that could be found in any major city in the US.

In and out in about an order but with service so flawless it didn't feel that fast. This place is fancy shamncy- in the way that they have a small brush to brush your bread crumbs off the table after your plates are cleared. Try the delicious pomegranate butter on the bread.

    "text": "We've been in Charlotte for a year now and I've always said we should try Napa on Providence but there are so many good places to eat... anyway, today we finally got there intending to sit outside as it was a beautiful day for mid December.  They were putting up temporary walls around the outside seating area for winter so inside we went but not to be disappointed by anything else!    We arrived around three in the afternoon on a weekday so it was nearly empty and we were shown to a nice booth in the California wine country themed main dining room.  Cara, our server showed up immediately and took our wine order and, as I had peeked at the menu online before leaving home I had our appetizer order ready too.  We ordered a shared starter from the top of the small plates menu, \"p.e.i. mussels blistered grape tomatoes, smoked pablano peppers, preserved lemon butter, white wine, grilled ciabatta\".  Cara brought our wine promptly along with a small loaf of fresh bread and some pomegranate butter (which was delicious).    Now, my wife and I are big fans of mussels and we've eaten them all over the world for many years and I can honestly say that the ones here are the best we've ever had anywhere, bar none.  We both agreed on that and also that it was an appetizer big enough to be shared between two.  They were served with small herb toasted bread in a wonderful buttery sauce that was also great for dipping the bread.    Then came the main courses;  pan seared scallops served over roasted golden beet couscous, wilted arugula, red beet gastrique, turnip puree for my wife and grilled salmon on top of a cauliflower mash, haricot verts, peperonata, cranberry marmellata for me.  I didn't even know what some of those add-ons were but I can tell you that both dishes were delicious and the presentation was amazing.  If there was a complaint, it would be that there were only two scallops in my wife's dish but they were genuine scallops and large ones at that.  We ordered a shared side dish of the roasted wild mushrooms which were also excellent.    So, the \"small\" plate of mussels was actually pretty big as was the side dish of mushrooms and even though the mains were a little smaller than we're used to we were both too full to try one of the wonderful sounding sweets from the dessert menu; maybe next time... and there will be a next time, probably many of them if everything is as good as what we had today.    Oh, and lets not forget... it is, after all, a Napa Valley wine themed restaurant and that is reflected in their massive wine list!  From service (thank you Cara) to ambience, to scrumptious food, it was truly a 5 star experience for us.",

    "text": "Party of four went to Napa Sunday 7-19-15 at 7pm for an anniversary dinner celebration.   On the way into Napa be sure to notice the grape vines along the walk with clusters of ripe concord grapes... juicy and semisweet.  Napa's style is California fusion with emphasis on new American cuisine: updated presentation of favorites using locally sourced fresh ingredients. Napa offers a \"3-course for $30\" option in addition to an extensive menu of a la carte offerings.  Napa has an extensive wine list, beer and other mixed drinks from the bar.The coffee is good, and the dessert offerings are quite tempting... something is sure to appeal to everyone.  The restaurant is very inviting; subdued lighting creates an intimate atmosphere. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Our waitress was an excellent server, made helpful recommendations... and in general was a sweetheart who checked frequently on our needs for drink refills including keeping the pewter water tumblers topped off with chilled water. She also brought another loaf of bread with more pomegranate-honey butter just in the nick of time.  Two celebrating their anniversary had the salmon, one had a pasta & chicken entree. I had the hanger steak and braised short rib... my meal was excellent. \"Near miss\" comments... that the chicken in the pasta dish was sparse, but the dish was very tasty. Also the fresh steamed green beans were a bit too al dente to suit our party.  If you wish to have a quiet evening, request seating away from the kitchen area which can get a bit noisy when busy. However, the kitchen is well run with very little need for loud verbal communication.  Another tip... if a restaurant looks clean... wonderful. BUT the neglected area (that tells the REAL TALE) will be the men's restroom... go take a look sometime during your evening. Napa has one of the BEST KEPT men's rooms in Charlotte... virtually spotless! AND the plush hand towels... paper but feel almost like cloth... AND ACTUALLY ARE LARGE ENOUGH that ONE is sufficient to dry BOTH YOUR HANDS! Well done, Napa!",

Really nice booths and tables. Upscale but laid back atmosphere. Cool water cups and glasses. Good wine selection. Our server was Chad and he took great care of us. Started out with a complimentary small plate of shrimp and grits with chorizo, which was very tasty. We decided to share some small plates (tapas style). The raw oysters were delicious, but kind of small. The lemon shrimp gnocchi was refreshing and delectable. The stuffed meatballs were really good. The beef carpaccio was pretty good too. Really great food and service!",

The server suggested a Caesar salad with a protein added -- so I ordered that with Salmon.  The salad itself was very ordinary (essentially a plate of lettuce), underdressed, and the salmon was a very small, thin square piece, and relatively dry.  When I asked for some anchovies to add some flavor, they \"were out.\"  Not a dinner-worthy experience.",

The atmosphere is intimate with a southern trendy vibe, perfect for a date night, girl's night out or even a perfect spot to stop at the bar for a cocktail or glass of wine before a night out.  Throughout the years I have enjoyed many evenings here, but most recently attended their monthly Wine and Dinner event.  This month's event, February 2019, was a \"Sparkling Wine Dinner\".  The dinner included a starter of Oysters and Proscecco with a four course meal paired with Sparkling Wines. Each dish was presented beautifully and both the Chef and Wine Representative spoke, in advance of each course, explaining the dish/wine and the reason behind the pairings.  We enjoyed wines from Italy, Spain and France and the Chef created amazing dishes to pair very well with each course. Napa on Providence remains one of my go to spots in Charlotte and their monthly Wine and Dinner events will be on my to do list going forward. Thank you Napa, looking forward to my next visit!",

I do like that they keep bottles of water at the table. And the bread is delicious. Service was decent, but not crazy good considering some of the menu prices.  There is a decent amount of price range on the menu which is pretty nice. Our group ordered an array of items. My boyfriend didn't love his seafood pasta. Was a lot more soupy than creamy which was a bit odd.  I ordered the beef tenderloin and it was very nicely cooked. It did seem as though everything was plated before the meat because some of the items were quite cold. The beef tenderloin was pretty spectacular though.  For dessert we ordered a variation of a peach cobbler. The flavor balance was pretty off. The oats to peach ratio wasn't right. I had about three bites and left the rest.   Based on my experience I don't particularly feel the need to go back, but if other friends wanted to go I'd give it another chance.",

    "text": "Before I proceed, it's important to note that this was a meal consumed entirely at the bar, and not in the main dining area:  One Friday night my husband and I were itching to try somewhere new. Since we're lucky to live in an area with tons of independently owned restaurants within a 5 minute drive, we decided to head down Providence. Napa was the perfect stop for the combination of a relaxing but classy (without being stuffy) atmosphere, and high quality drinks and food.   I'd been thinking about coming here because their Spinach Salad with Grilled Steak was on Charlotte Agenda's \"25 Best Salads in Charlotte\" list, and since we've been trying to eat healthy, this seemed like the perfect excuse to go.   We sat at the bar and enjoyed both the happy hour special charcuterie and a glass of rose on special. Both were delicious and well priced. They spinach salad with steak definitely stole the show, though. The steak is cooked to order and such a treat. I love my steaks cooked rare, and they did it perfectly. The salad was light and refreshing and the meat was tender and juicy and the perfect temperature.   We were their on the early side (arriving around 6pm, I believe.) We really enjoyed chatting with the bartenders before the place got very busy. They were very friendly and gave us attention even though there were obviously some regulars sitting at the bar who would be spending far more on their tab than we were on ours. It was nice and they made us feel appreciated as well.  Overall I would definitely love to come back again.",

Upon parking (there is a private lot behind the restaurant) we walked in for our 8:00PM reservation. The front of the restaurant is covered with grapes. Very cool. There is a great outdoor seating area.   We sat inside. The decor is very Northern California and felt very clean.   We were presented with the menu and a wine list when we first sat. They were running a special so my husband and I decided to do the 3 for $30 deal and we ordered a bottle of wine for the table.   I forget the wine, but it was sooo good.   The waitress dropped a fresh baguette off at the table and a little dish of their house pomegranate butter. YES, you've read correctly. And DUH it was awesome.   My in laws shared an order of the corn fritters as an appetizer. I did not try one, but they seemed to enjoy them. I ordered a peach watermelon salad as my first course and my husband ordered stuffed meatballs. He thoroughly enjoyed the meatballs and I enjoyed my salad so much I made a replica one the following weekend.  For the main course my husband ordered the pasta primavera with chicken and I ordered the salmon with couscous. My in laws ordered pork loin.   The real winner was the salmon, cooked perfectly at medium (yes, I like my fish cooked a little bit more than it should be) and the flavor was incredible. My husband claims \"one of the best salmons he's ever had\". His pasta was delicious too (we brought some home and I ate it cold the next day).  For dessert we ordered flourless chocolate cake and a marscapone cheesecake. Both were wonderful!  I very much look forward to coming back with a girlfriend for wine and appetizers!  One of my new favorites here in CLT!",

The restaurant is charming and decorated nicely. The cups/glasses/tableware were all pretty and different - cool points for that. This place gave me modern vibes mixed with a bit of Southern hospitality.     I ordered the grilled shrimp pizza which was big enough for two to share, very tasty! It was pesto and cheese on flatbread with shrimp - overall very delicious (but beware, the thing is huge for one person!)  The other folks at my table tried the Grilled Chilean Salmon as well as the Salmon Burger and gave good reviews on those dishes as well. For dessert, we opted for cappuccinos - thumbs up on the good coffee! In regards to the service, our server was a bit slow, I am imagining a Monday afternoon with a smaller staff is responsible for that.   Napa on Providence provided a good setting for our work related meeting and I believe in the evening it's a good place for a date or just an outing with friends, there's a nice patio out back too! Overall, I would return.",

    "text": "Napa on Providence was a restaurant I was looking forward to visiting ever since I had pre-dinner drinks there back in October of 2017. We stopped in for a cocktail/glass of wine before another dinner, and just off that it stayed on my list.  I finally got a chance to go back on a Friday night after making an OpenTable reservation. It was a nice night so we elected to sit outside underneath one of the umbrellas. It was nice being outside because you feel like you're apart from the hustle and bustle of the inside but don't feel like you're too far away from service.  Unfortunately, I don't remember our server's name, but I do remember she was fantastic the whole night. She was able to offer both food and wine recommendations, and was quick to get us what we asked for.  We all got some wine/cocktails and when those arrived, our server also brought fresh bread. Bread was deliiiicious (and endless) and came with a really tasty pomegranate butter. It was a little on the sweet side so I can see why not everyone would enjoy it, but I thought it was a fun twist on normal butter.  We started off with the arancini balls and a charcuterie plate. The arancini balls were some of the best I've had! They came out piping hot, cheesy, and crunchy AF. They didn't skimp on the sauce that came with it, which is always appreciated. It came with 5 large balls which was generous! I'd say this is a must get if you're a lover of fried cheese and tomato sauces. The charcuterie plate was kind of \"eh\" for me and didn't have the variety I'd expect of a place called \"Napa.\" Not worst, but certainly not the best.   There were 3 or 4 options I struggled with for an entree, but eventually went with the beef filet with veal demi, fried potato cake and asparagus. I'd give this dish a 4/5 because the filet, demi, and asparagus were on POINT. Cook was perfect, asparagus was still crisp, demi was super flavorful. The only downfall was the fried potato cake. I'm not sure if it was just how it was prepared but the potatoes tasted pretty undercooked. The outside of it was crunchy, but biting into it, it felt like the potatoes could have used a few more minutes. Other than that, a delicious dish!  If you're looking for a place to come on a summer evening to have a nice cocktail, wine, or a few bites, you'd be well served to try out Napa!",

Because it wasn't very memorable, the prices are a bit steep, and I did't feel any \"wow\"!   A couple girlfriends and I went on a weeknight, and it was busy, but not difficult to get a table.  The housemade honey/pomegranate butter Kellie K. mentioned in her review really is a nice touch...as is the warm bread.  Add points.   We shared a meatball appetizer which looked visually appealing...three cheese stuffed meatballs on little beds of polenta.  The meatballs were  a bit on the salty side...and had way too much pepper...but overall edible and were all consumed.   For my main, I had crab stuffed trout with broccolini and roasted red peppers.  It was...like the meatballs, edible and fine.  But I wouldn't go home and pine...yearn...have a burning desire to eat these things again.    My friends had pizzas...which looked good...they said were good...but would have been just as good as a higher end pizza restaurant, like Wolfgang Puck or Pure.   For dessert, we shared a trio of creme brulee (one vanilla, the other berry, and orange blossom) which were all good, but again...it's creme brulee.  The pannacotta was a bit on the too congealed side, but also good...but not good enough to finish despite being full...or good enough to want to lick the plate clean.   Our server was a doll...but we didn't get any real passion about the food, or sell on what would be delicious, so who knows, maybe we just ordered incorrectly. A man who looked like he maybe was the manager on duty or GM came over to assist in serving, and wasn't particularly friendly or warm, which we found strange.   That and the price for what we got left us feeling a bit disappointed...but hey, you can sign up for their rewards program, so every $250 you spend,you get $25!  (That was said with a bit of sarcasm.) Honestly, I would have spent my $35 or however much my dinner was, at Good Food, and relished...savored...really paid attention and enjoyed the food and experience.   Overall, it's a solid place...lovely interior and the food is a B.  But when I want to spend money and laugh and have a good time, I want to feel passion and love and energy ooze out of a restaurant, and will probably go somewhere else.",

    "text": "I won't go back. The most exciting aspect of this restaurant is that they claim to have barrel dispensed wine, house made breads and cheeses(!) and farm-to-table menu. Oh yes, all of these sound great but might just be marketing ploys. The wine is dispensed from kegs(they say barrel to make it sound fancy.) I love the keg wine idea if it's used to offer better wines at reasonable prices, but this restaurant makes a killing off their wine program and offer no values. Examples- Pine Ridge Chenin Blanc retail-$12/ this restaurant $45, Pennywise Petite Sirah retail $10/ here-$44, Caymus Cab retail- $65/ here $150. Could you imagine a wine barrel behind a bar anyway?   The food quality is good, but I want more! I want damn good food when I pay $25 for a plate. Why is \"good\" the standard and they don't try for great, exciting food? The menu covers all the necessities: fish, check; steak, check; chicken, check; a house specialty; check...Boring, check. The food quality and decor earned them two stars in my book. Now, get creative, use local food sources and cut your wine prices in half and you'll catch up with the 2000s.  I don't know if the bread is made in house- our server didn't know either. When asked about the house made cheeses, the server explained there aren't any. Then went on to say the Humboldt Fog cheese is from Humboldt County, NC(ouch!). And you'd think if the produce or meat were local they might mention the farms they source from, but no. And, yep the server didn't know where the produce or meats came from either.   Maybe, I am completely in the wrong and they simply don't want to put farms' names on the menu or haven't found reliable sources since opening. Maybe this is actually a farm-to-table restaurant and I just had a clueless server. Maybe they make their own cheeses and breads and maybe Humboldt Fog comes from Humboldt County, North Carolina.",

    "text": "I struggled with the rating. This is a beautiful restaurant, with ample parking (it makes it SO much easier). The hostesses were super cute but not ditzy-cute- friendly and engaging.  I think our server was in training but it was obvious she was only new to the restaurant, because she understood nuances that a newbie server wouldnt. Both she and her mentor were friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. They contributed to an enjoyable evening.  So, I'm gushing - so why only three stars? Well, the food was... ok.  We started off w a half- dozen roasted oysters. The were covered w parmesan then probably were put under a broiler(?). The parmesan overpowered the oyster and I couldn't taste it. Perhaps less cheese? And, because the cheese melted over the sides of the shell, it stuck to the rock salt. NOT a pleasurable taste to put a piece of rock salt in your mouth.  We shared a beet salad that was the best bite of the evening. The arugula was refreshing, and it was dressed perfectly. The beets had a great flavor but could have benefitted from a little more carmelization. We then shared a charcuterie board. Chorizo, blue cheese, and duck ham. The servers raved about the duck ham. When I said I'm not that crazy about smoke flavor, they both said it was not smoky.  It was VERY smoky and the thick band of raw fat around it made me gag. The chorizo was good, the blue cheese was okay. The board came with two big chunks of granola that.could only be eaten by picking them up and biting off a piece. No way to do that graciously.  Admittedly, we did not try any entrees, but we really don't eat that way. The small plates have to represent too! Because we had such a nice time (kudos to the staff) we will probably come back and give a few <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fother.menu&s=653e7b3ea0753002ea3fbc73f9d47d447b23518dd1f1df211cd387ad0f7a5bce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">other.menu</a> items a try.",

Their oysters were awesome, I can't recall where they were from but they were a tad salty so use the lemon! I chose the seabass which came with a pomegranate puree . I ended the night with a creme brule' trio, vanilla, caramel and chocolate. Chocolate was my least favorite but I enjoyed it!!! This restaurant is farm to table so the menu varies seasonally.

First of all, we will never dine in the main dining area again because it smells like dirty wash rags!!  It has been this way for several years now. We mentioned this twice to our servers over the past year, but it still smells bad.  We were so embarrassed that we went against our better judgement and ignored the smell and brought some friends from out of town.  Our one friend, who speaks his mind, pointed out the smell after only 5 minutes!!!  We were so embarrassed! We moved to the bar area, and no problem there. From that day on, we never dined in the dining area again!!  We really liked this place and continued to go, but only sat in the bar.  No issues, until the last several months.  The food has gone downhill.  Every dish tasted like they seasoned it with salt!  No taste, just salty. Awful.  And, when we ordered wine at the bar, they were basically out of everything we requested.  Gave us a sip of what was left in a bottle, then walked away and never offered to let us taste anything else or even ask if we wanted anything else!!  The other night, we were the only ones at the bar, there were 2 bartenders and we sat for 10 minutes without a glance our way!!!  It was weird and unacceptable!!   We sooo use to enjoy the food and service here, but wow, it sure has declined.  We were going to host a Valentine's dinner in the room with the fireplace, but after our experience last week, we decided it was not going to happen.  So disappointed with this place as of late.  Don't think we will be back.  Food, wine selection and service has declined rapidly.  Too bad.",

    "text": "Great food and beautiful atmosphere. We were super lucky to get a seat at the bar before it got overly packed on a Friday night. Had the most delightful bartender (is that what they are referred to as these days) take care of us. Kelly, was her name and she provided amazing and friendly service. I love the eclectic mix of diners that were there. The wine on tap was a nice touch. The kitchen got a little backed up at one point but the place was packed so that was to be expected, but when the food arrived it was to perfection. I have to say, it's probably just me, but I'm so over the trendy farm to table style of being crammed in next to a stranger in a half booth with no table cloth, listening to my conversation, getting a $30 plate of one single pea placed artfully on top of a piece of salmon type of restaurant where the acoustics are so bad I can't here the server rattle off the specials. Can't I have locally sourced food without all that? But I digress, my point is, I'm in love with this (Napa on Providence) style dining experience that brings us back to a slightly more traditional dining experience while still providing a trendy bar scene and modern dining menu. Win.",

    "text": "This place had been on my list for over a year and last week we finally decided to give it a try.  I am so happy that we did because I had a truly delicious meal.  The menu is top to bottom excellent and so we decided to go tapas style and just order appetizers.  The Calamari were very well made, on the lighter side, with plenty to share.  The meatballs on polenta cakes were the best meatballs I have ever eaten.  They have mozarella inside and the marinara sauce is quite tasty, but the belle of the ball was the gnocchi with duck confit.  Even if the duck had been absent the gnocchi were themselves fantastic, but the duck wasn't absent, and it too was wonderful.  The place is quite charming on the inside and out.  I would definitely pay a return visit.  As mentioned by some other folks, the place fills up very quickly and the parking is not wonderful, but who cares!  I would have been happy to wait or look for parking, in order to get this high quality food.",

I ordered the grilled chicken pasta dish and it was so bland. The chicken was dry and cut up already (I don't mind cutting my own food) and the sauce tasted like plain alfredo sauce. I had the cookie for dessert and again, super dry and I could've sliced and baked a better cookie.  The atmosphere was really nice though and the service was GREAT. Not sure I would go back based on the prices and the blandness of the food. Maybe I would try something else.",

    "text": "From the beginning, I have heard nothing but praise for this place.  Several friends had already gone and been inordinately pleased.  One of them even ordered off-menu and was thrilled with his experience, so my expectations were high.   I was not dissapointed.     From the moment we walked in the door, we were treated as invited guests.  The entire staff was warm, attentive and cooperative, our server was clever, well-informed, and charming; the surroundings were beautiful and simple.   We never felt rushed, though we were almost the last customers to leave.  We lingered, savored slowly and absorbed the evening.    The food was perfect.  The most beautiful oysters I've ever seen.  The baby beet salad was perfectly balanced, lacking nothing, and the roasted mushrooms in the tagliatelle were heavenly.    The hangar steak was almost pretty enough to tempt this vegetarian to cross over to the dark side... almost.  Although we couldn't find room for dessert, they all sounded wonderful, and I am sure we will have plenty of opportunity to indulge in future visits.  The manager dropped by to make sure that our experience was wonderful, spending a few moments making us feel welcome, asking for feedback and suggestions.  I suspect this will become a regular \"after-work wine and friends\" local.  It just feels good.    On a side note, I decided to save some for lunch today, had it boxed and, of course, left it on the table.  When we were half-way home, I actually turned around for it. To my delight, they saved it for me.  And I'm so glad.  It was delicious.  :)",

We were directed to the bar where we chose to sit and enjoy. Amanda was our server, and we were highly impressed from beginning to end. She recommended a great wine, which is was very knowledgeable about and apps for us. The fig and prosciutto pizza was phenomenal!  I wanted to order a second one, but I didn't want to seem like a cow if front of my female guest. The calamari was crisp, hot, and very tasteful. I was blown away not only by the ambience but the food and service! Kevin and Amanda took excellent care of us, treated us like royalty,  and always served us with a smile. All of those elements are very rare in restaurants these days. My friends and I eat out a lot, and these are the experiences we look for and recommend. I can't thank you enough for investing in detail and quality. My friends, family, and I will definitely be back!   Sincerely,  Your new Regular-Degular",

    "text": "I came to Napa on Providence for restaurant week with four hungry men ready to eat their way through wine country. I assumed this restaurant was California-inspired fare based off their name and some word-of-mouth reviews, but not quite sure it fell into that category...  Anyway, I opted to order off the regular menu. I had the Heaven in a Bowl salad which was delicious (although my waiter led me to believe otherwise...odd). A very good size portion of frisee tossed in a bacon vinaigrette, topped with grilled onions and a poached egg. It was delicious. I also had the pork pizza which was fine but nothing special.   The boys had the short rib (which they loved, I thought it was fine) and sides of mac and cheese. As other Yelpers have pointed out, this mac and cheese is divine. Big, curly noodles, creamy Velveeta-like sauce, topped with crispy breadcrumbs? Yes.  I'll come back, but probably just for wine and snacks. The atmosphere is cool and the portions are generous. Thanks!",

I started with a succulent order of Oysters Rockefeller, followed by an excellent dish of grilled Mahi Mahi. My wife's steak was equally outstanding, and the extensive selection of wine-by-the-glass allowed us to sample some wonderful labels for the first time.   The location is convenient, the parking free, and the intimate setting perfect for just about any special occassion. We couldn't have picked a better spot to celebrate a special night out, and will definitely be back.",

We ordered the shrimp and lemon gnocchi to start and my oh my was it one of the most amazing dishes we've ever enjoyed! We ate every single bite. My husband went on to order the pan seared salmon while I had the fig and prosciutto pizza. We literally devoured every bite of that as well. In between, we ordered a couple beers, the infused gin cocktail and a glass of rose. The gin cocktail. Get it. When it came to dessert, we literally couldn't decide out of the four, so the amazing bartender, Kevin, who took care of us today,  convinced the kitchen to give us half orders of dessert so we could try it all. Again, clean plates. This place has been on our must try list for a while but today we made it happen. We are more than fulfilled and satisfied.  We are delighted.",

The food is fantastic - I had the grilled hanger steak salad - YUMM!! Our server, Katrina, was wonderful at helping us pick out and recommending different cheeses and meats when ordering the Charcuterie (which also had the most amazing granola/honey on it). I could tell from her upbeat personality that she was a passionate foodie just like me! She took excellent care of us and told us all about the brunch they offer on the weekends too!  Attending on a Wednesday night also allowed us the pleasant sounds of a live band, Stella's fellas, while we enjoyed our dinner.   Best Tip about this place: The location is on a dead end street, meaning it's a tucked away and there is outdoor seating with very little traffic - its peaceful and quite.

They have a great happy hour selection of cocktails, wine and appetizers. Definitely a nice bar area. I am torn on my rating----hard to give 4 or 5 stars when they forgot to put in my food order. There was a party of 6 and something happened to my order, either not put in or the kitchen simply messed it up. Nt much fun to sit and watch the rest of the table eat most of theirs before I received mine. That being said, the pan seared duck I ordered was good. A friend ordered the scallops with risotto - it was really good. Also sampled the eggplant mash that came with someone else's salmon---good as well. They also brought me soup while I waited which was nice but I really couldn't eat it.  I give the server and manager credit for trying to recover from my missing entree. They comped my dessert---olive oil lemon creme cake---delish!!! So all in all, I would return. Everyone seemed pleased with their food and drink selections.",

We were very grateful for the amount of interaction an especially how friendly she was to our 1 year old.   The food was... Simply amazing. I am not sure if we can find anything negative. We started off with the corn breads which were soft and very sweet.   Our small plates consisted of a Napa Salad for my wife which was beautifully prepare, fresh and very vibrant. I order a cup of mushroom soup which was very savory. Our entrees were delicious and very filling. My wife order the sausage frittata and I order the short rib benedict. The food had very well balance of flavor and freshness.   Regardless of the hectic day the staff had ahead of them, they were all very cheerful and friendly.

At the tail end of our meal, the ceiling began to pour down on us, the staff quickly moved us outside which was nice. Thankfully, I believe it was water, so my white shirt didn't suffer a major loss.

    "text": "I had been hearing and seeing this place on my way to work for a long while now. I finally made reservations and headed over here after church for brunch. The outside of this restaurant is beautiful with grape vines lining the path and an awesome patio in the front. We were seated right away and the dining area was crowded but not too crazy. We were seated in a booth but the back of the booth was a little loose and was being moved by the people in the booth behind us which was slightly uncomfortable. Our waiter was attentive and timely but seemed to be in a terrible mood. We ordered coffee and a mimosa. This place has 15 dollar endless mimosas which I definitely want to come back and enjoy some time. We ordered chicken and waffles and the French toast. The chicken and waffles were good but the spicy syrup was a little much to me. The French toast was tasty but one piece was pretty soggy for some reason. They came with bacon and the bacon was phenomenal. We were so hungry I forgot to take pictures. Overall for brunch this place is great for enjoying a nice afternoon and chilling out. I would definitely come back and would love to try dinner.",

    "text": "2 years later and Sunday Brunch was still solid. On the other hand, I'm amazed that they haven't updated the brunch menu - I guess if it ain't broken, don't fix it.  I didn't have bottomless mimosa this time, but most of my friends did. Our waiter was GREAT with bringing refills. Food was great, I didn't feel like brunch food and went with the duck confit gnocchi ($11) which was a good size portion for a small plate AND DE-LI-CIOUS!  Solid brunch spot - good job with keeping up a good job!",

    "text": "This was an okay place to experience and I don't really see myself going back here.  The place is nestled in a nice area, and although I thought the first area I saw for parking was small, I drove a little bit past the restaurant and was able to find great parking where I didn't feel like I had to cram my car into a spot.  I had gone into this restaurant with a party of five and honestly, when I stepped foot into the place, I didn't really feel warm and welcomed.  Perhaps it's because my party were all girls that look like we're still in high school/college.  While walking to our table, I noticed the decorations were all very beautiful in here.  We were able to have a booth long booth, and I really like having a booth for a party of 5 instead of just tables.    The waiter was nice, but I felt that he wasn't quite attentive with us as he was to the other tables around us.  That really irked me.  He also did not mention to us the specials that they had for the night.  How were we able to order the specials?  I randomly noticed it written on the chalk board so I read the specials myself.  The food here definitely was not amazing for me.  The only thing that I really liked was the p.e.i. mussels.  If you come here, you definitely need to try that out.  My main meal was the braised short rib and grilled hanger steak.  I thought it tasted okay, but it was a little flavorless for me.  The spinach was something that definitely stuck out to me.  It was too salty!  I mean, I love salty food, but when it's too salty for me...no bueno!  All in all, not a good experience for me.",

Been there three times in a three week span, and each time it's been a splendid experience. For starters, the restaurant is beautiful, and the service is terrific.  Their fresh bread and pomegranate butter is such a nice way to start the meal. They have a great wine selection as well, and pair that with their Charcuterie plate of fine cheese and meats - you're in for a treat.  Some of my favorite items on their menu include the fried calamari (probably one of the best I've every had), shrimp and lemon gnocchi (rich & delicious), molisana salami pizza (yummm!), seafood Cobb salad (totally satisfying!), bucatini (fresh pasta, fresh tomato sauce - simplicity at it's best).   Their Creme brulee trio (caramel, vanilla and orange) is a must have, but so is their chocolate molten lava cake & cheesecake =) make sure you save room for dessert!  Eagerly awaiting my next visit to Napa on Providence!",

    "text": "I was here for a work Christmas lunch and we were able to sample quite a few items off of the menu and I believe they deserve a solid 3 stars.  The food in theory all sounded amazing but I just don't feel like the execution was all it could have been.  Nothing was completely repulsive and nothing will encourage me to return.  It was just an \"OK\" experience all around.  We started with a few of their flatbread/pizzas.  The crust was thin and the flavor was bland.  There were a couple thin slices of onion and pebbles of chicken on the flavorless toasted bread.  There was no sauce and the cheese was plastic in texture and taste.  Next came the calamari.  It was an asian inspired calamari which doesn't seem to go well together but it was pretty decent.  I mean, let's be honest.  It was fried dough with a sweet and sour sauce dumped on it.  Of course it was good.  But in terms of real-deal, fresh calamari...it isn't even in the game.  Next up--mozzerella stuffed meatballs.  I was excited about this one but was let down.  The meat was tender and seasoned well but it didn't taste like ground beef.  In fact I would almost suggest it was a turkey or chicken meatball.  There was very little sauce so that was disappointing and the cheese in the center was so minimal that it probably shouldn't even be mentioned.  They were just okay.  For my main meal I ordered the special.  It was scallops on top of red pepper risotto.  The scallops seemed to be fresh, nice and tender and didn't require much seasoning.  The risotto wasn't really risotto...it was orzo pasta but the red pepper flavoring was done well and besides the fact I was expecting traditional risotto, it was pretty good.  A couple co-workers ordered chicken sandwiches and one ordered the filet mignon burger.  I've never heard of that but it certainly has potential to be good.  She seemed to be enjoying it.    For dessert we tried quite a few items.  They had a creme brulee trio (chocoate, vanilla and peppermint), eggnog cheesecake, double chocolate cake, and red velvet cupcakes.  The vanilla and chocolate creme brulee were fine--good, not great.  I didn't even try the peppermint custard because that just sounded gross.  The eggnog cheesecake was festive and truly tasted like eggnog which I thought was pretty good.  The double chocolate cake was more like a mousse and it was served cold, which I hate.  I prefer warm and serve it with ice cream please!    We were given the back room for the \"party\" and that fit the 10 of us quite nicely.  I also think the patio with the lounge furniture and heat lamps is lovely.  It would certainly be nice to hang out there during the warmer months when they offer live music.  All in all I think this place has some good to offer but nothing great that I could see.  I feel like they try to offer 5 star dishes at a 5 star price but with a 3 star budget.  Nothing was done exceptionally well and nothing was necessarly memorable.  It was all Ok.",

Since the weather was nice today, I decided to sit outdoors.     My server brought a bottle of water along with fresh bread and honey-pomegranate butter.  The bread was good and the butter was excellent. For my entree, I decided to go with the fish sandwich...according to my server, the fish today was flounder.  I asked to sub mac-n-cheese for the fries since I had heard that their mac & cheese was excellent.   Since the mac was a pretty big portion, I decided to just eat the fish and leave the bread. (Even though the bread was tasty.)  Everything was good, and I didn't have any issues  with my meal. I was also happy to see that they only charged a $2 upcharge to sub the mac & cheese instead of the fries.    On my visit, the service was good, no issues at all. However, this is not a place to duck into for a quick meal... it took an entire hour from the time I was seated until I got my check.  Which is great, if you are not dining alone... but because I was dining alone, it seemed to take forever.   Still, the food was good, service was gracious, and I would eat here again if I happen to be back in the area.",

    "text": "I went here for brunch with some fabulous friends, and it was FANTASTIC! We sat on the patio and our server was very attentive and patient. They have bottomless mimosas (I think for $15 or $18); however, if you just want one it's only like $6. You just have to know to ask for a single glass. We made reservations which I would definitely suggest!  Some of the girls got chicken sandwiches (they asked for theirs grilled not fried). They were HUGE and they seemed to love them and the fries. As other reviewers noted, they have these really interesting copper glasses. Which, I actually expected to be a problem - I expected it to change the taste of the water, but it didn't. Inside the cup it looked like steel with only the hammered copper on the outside. For water, they bring you a bottle (just a plain glass bottle with a rubber stopper) of chilled water so you never run out.   I skipped the mimosa on this occasion, but my friend ordered one and seemed to enjoy it. I looked around and noticed the mimosas were a big hit. In fact, I noticed some men had ordered mimosas but requested them in larger wine glasses than in the flutes - which I thought was clever. I also noticed one guy who asked for him mimosa in two wine glasses with OJ in one and champagne in the other - also clever!  Now I ordered the Pancetta Hash and Poached Eggs, which is something totally unusual for me to order. (See my photo.) THANK GOD I DID - OMG! Delish! So it reminded me of a farm-to-table rustic dish with a mix of cubed and roasted sweet potatoes with pancetta (which were like little cubes of cooked ham, more hammy than bacony - are those words?). There was thinly sliced and sauteed fennel mixed in (not to be confused with just the seeds, which can be quite potent. This was mild and really really good.). There were also sauteed sliced peppers mixed in and it was all well seasoned. On top of that, there were two perfectly poached eggs (hooray!) and on top of that there was a drizzle of their homemade hollandaise sauce. SO SO SO SO SO GOOD!   Seriously, if you go for brunch, go outside the box and get this dish. You can get an omelet or waffles anywhere, this is a special dish. And it was reasonably priced at $12. If you're not driving, also go with the bottomless mimosas! I hope I get to go back soon! It was an hour drive from my home (I live North of the city), but was totally worth it - the food, the service, the atmosphere and the experience were all great!",

The table next to use received the full attention of the weight staff, they were promptly greeted and offered bread and had their drink order taken right away. It so sad that this happened, the manager was the one that had to take our order for dinner and dessert and had to send a server to bring an additional drink.

    "text": "Me and a few friends had dinner at Napa on Providence on a Wednesday night. A co-worker suggested the place and had good things to say so I was eager to try it.  The first thing I noticed when arriving was the beautiful art on the walls and high ceilings.We were seated past the bar in the area of the dining room which overlooked the terrace. on a cooler day I think it would have been an ideal place to sit. The waitress immediately came by to provide water and fresh bread with a nice honey butter. The menu had a lot of unique items and the wine list was extensive but not overwhelming offering by the glass, carafe, and by the bottle offerings.   I had a glass of rose which was very good and not overly sweet, while my friend had a cabernet. For entrees I ordered the mushroom and crab ravioli which was very light, flavorful and refreshing from the lemon zest and the black pepper ravioli. It was a good choice to pair with the rose, and would probably also go well with a Chardonnay or Viognier from the wine list. My friends had the duck duo and the hanger steak salad, both of which looked very good.   There were many items on the appetizer list as well as other dishes I would like to try in the future based on some of the dishes other diners had around me, the pizzas and charcuterie looked great and I plan on trying the swordfish on next visit. Overall I thought the food, service, decor, and wine list were excellent.   I would be mindful that the parking is a little sparse but I believe there may be lots nearby or even at Harris Teeter if space is limited.",

    "text": "They serve water in metal cups which was odd because it throws off your palate. For a place focused on the wine experience that's a faux pas.  Who wants the taste of metal on their mouth just before sipping a new glass of wine? Easily remedied though by an extra wine glass for water.  The charcuterie didn't have as much variation in flavor between the different meats as I've experienced at other places.  I would give it three stars as an appetizer.  Needed a lot more bread crisps to go with it as well.  They gave us 6... You don't just eat it plain because it's so heavy.  I had the filet and it was cooked perfectly.  The wine reduction was great.  French fries are also super tasty, a small portion that keeps you wanting more.  I wasn't crazy for the haricot vert but that's because I don't like undercooked green beans and they're always like that.    Our waitress raised my review a star.  Would definitely go back to try more on the menu because of the ambience and service was excellent from start to finish.",

    "text": "Here in barbecucentric Charlotte, California cuisine is practically nonexistent.  That is, until Napa on Providence opened in November 2012, taking over the space that Providence Cafe occupied for twenty plus years, and infusing the Charlotte food scene with a little spice of the northern California countryside.  The vibe inside the remodeled restaurant is polished, warm, and inviting with a large bar area plus an attractive patio.  As the name suggests, Napa on Providence specializes in Californian cuisine, the root of which is fresh ingredients, simply prepared.  Napa takes this tenet seriously-all dishes are made to order, from the sauce for the macaroni and cheese to the outstanding white beans with house-made sausage, which taste like they've simmered together for hours.  Everything is thoughtfully executed, all the way down to the drinking water they distill in-house and the hammered copper drinking glasses they serve it in.  Even the house bread is special.  The rolls are handmade by a retired Navy baker.  They are dense and chewy and served in recycled cork baskets along with pomegranate honey butter.  Once in season, the pomegranates will be harvested from a hundred year old tree at the foot of Napa's patio.  Dinner at Napa starts with small plates, and sharing is encouraged.  The food arrives at the table in rustic cast iron skillets perched upon stark white dishes, and each selection is beautifully composed.  The small plate offerings include charcuterie, both grilled and raw oysters, and several salads.  The meatballs are my personal favorite. Made from a mix of beef and pork, they are studded with small chunks of carrot, stuffed with house-made mozzarella, and served perched upon polenta cakes with homemade tomato pomodoro sauce.  The steamed clams with homemade sausage are very popular, and are served in a delicious salty white wine sauce with roasted garlic, fennel, and slices of charred crostini.  Napa also offers a handful of pizzas, served on house-made dough and topped with fresh mozzarella.  John, the bartender, raved about the pork pizza.  It features porchetta with white cheddar, caramelized onions, and roasted red peppers.  Speaking of John, I couldn't ask for a friendlier more attentive bartender.  His genuine excitement for the food and spirits was contagious.  There are several large plate offerings, each masterfully crafted:  grilled swordfish, halibut, hanger steak, and even a Carolina cheeseburger.  There are two pasta dishes:  the popular lobster macaroni that's made with Velveeta and beer and the bucatini featuring the homemade pomodoro, roasted garlic, and grape tomatoes (which I am dying to try).  A house favorite (as well as one on my personal top picks) is the poulet rouge.  It's a roasted half chicken with a horseradish pan gravy served with roasted root veggies.  Simple, rustic, and delightful.  Each night, there are chef's specials available.  I recently tried the roasted duck with cherry glaze, and as a person who doesn't often favor game, I was very impressed.  The risotto served alongside was fantastic.  It had baby bella mushrooms and whole cherry tomatoes that added little pops of sweetness to the creamy rice.  Of course, Napa is known for its wine, and there is an abundance at the restaurant.  There are nearly 80 varieties available, with bottle prices ranging from $33 to $175, and approximately twenty varieties available by the glass.  At Napa on Providence, the drink specialties encompass more than vino-they also barrel-infuse several liquors, which are featured in handcrafted cocktails.  I tried and thoroughly enjoyed the Napa Manhattan infusion:  Woodford bourbon lightly infused with cherries, vanilla bean, and sweet vermouth.  There are also specialty brunch cocktails, my favorite being the Napa Mimosa, complete with plump pomegranate seeds floating around in the bubbly champagne.  Napa rounds out the beverage offerings with pod espresso beverages and loose leaf tea.  All great meals should end on a sweet note, and the dessert options are quite enticing.   Currently, you can choose between a trio of creme brulee, lemon tart pie, a chocolate duo of lava cake and chocolate pot de creme, or follow my lead and get the warm caramel apple bread pudding, which I somehow managed to devour every last bite of.",

    "text": "OMG! What took me so long to visit? This place is wonderful! The curb appeal is excellent. I love the wine vines that line the entry way. The atmosphere, indoor and out, is cottage chic. The outdoor patio is so inviting.  It feels like you've been invited to a fabulous dinner party. What a great space!  The staff is super friendly! The hostesses, waiters and manager were all very pleasant and attentive (without being annoying). They genuinely wanted to ensure that we had a great experience.   The food is DELICIOUS! We came for restaurant week so we enjoyed a three course meal and a glass of wine for $30. We decided to share everything. The meal includes warm bread and fresh pomegranate honey butter. The butter was incredible!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. For dinner, we started with the sauteed shrimp gnocchi and kale salad. Both were flavorful and delicious. For the main course, we ordered the hanger steak with risotto and the bone-in pork chop over a light German pasta. The steak was tender and juicy. The risotto was good, but the grains were a little large for my personal taste. The show stopper was the bone-in pork chop. It was absolutely amazing!!  It's was thick, but still juicy, tender and sooooo flavorful. I couldn't get enough. The restaurant rotates the menu items. If this item is on the menu it is a must try!!   For dessert, we split the salted caramel cheesecake and the peaches and creme. They were a great way to finish a fabulous meal. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the peaches and cream a little but more than the cheesecake. It was so light and it had a blueberry compote in the middle. Yum!   I also really enjoyed the house merlot (which the manager treated us too since we had to wait a while for a table). It was a Prologue by Anderson's Conn Valley Vineyards. It was delicious. It was light and fruity with a smooth finish.   I can't wait to visit again. They have happy hour specials in the evening and live music a few nights a week. They also have brunch on Sundays.  After only one visit this is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. I love everything about this place. The atmosphere, the food, the wine and the people. Great job guys!!",
