Started of with drinks, which that had a nice selection of beers and cocktails. After our first round we order appetizers and dinner, which both were very tasty. Was tempted by desert (our server did a good job to try to entice us, but we were all full from dinner). If you want to watch any sporting event, this would be a good place to do so. They have a crazy number of TVs.",

Preyy good servers for a sports bar kinda atmosphere. But it seems they just miss the mark with the food. I've gotten wings, a burger and a wrap the couple of times I was there and they were just ehhh....I had to send my wings back and so did the other 3 people at the table who had them because they were super chewy and the sauce tasted funny. Either way, my frinds and I like this place to watch sports and we were glad to see it open back up after the old business (Jillians) closed since its in a great spot in Southend Charlotte. All in all we'll go back, but we always eat before we go now. -SK",

I went on their first day open, 6/5/12, and it was well put together but not everything was completely finished i.e. beer taps which I understand the soft opening idea.  I had the \"fiery drunk burger\" which adds fried jalapenos and beer cheese to a typical burger.  It was delicious and  possibly the best cooked burger I've had in Charlotte--a perfect medium.  The fries were also very good, a thick fry batter and topped with ground pepper.  decently priced at $9 and $3 for a bottle of domestic beer.  It did look like they had some good craft beers lined up for tap so I look forward to trying those next time.  Forgot to mention, the bar has an 80\" TV in the middle above it with three 60\" on each side.  looks great!",

The \"homemade\" dressing didn't taste homemade either. The flavors didn't blend, and it made for a very bland salad. The only good thing I can say about it was that it wasn't overpriced.

I eat a late lunch so there was not too many people there and the hostess let me pick my table, so I took a big comfy booth.    My server came by right away and got my drink order and to see if I had any questions about the menu.  I was intrigued by the soft pretzel with beer cheese and she told me how good it was, but also how large.  So I decided to order it and if I was still hungry I'd get something else because she told me the kitchen was pretty quick.  Turns out it was a really great pretzel, the cheese wasn't my fave but the pretzel was so soft with a nice crunchy exterior and served piping hot!  I was a little hungry still so I got the spinach salad and it was also delicious.  It was spinach with tomato, cranberries and feta.  I did think it could use maybe a nut or something for a different texture, but overall a great salad.  It seems like they have drink specials during the week.  The whole place is huge and I bet it would be a great place to watch a game.  The only reason I went with 4 stars was they should have some more lunch offerings besides the salads/sandwiches, entrees don't start till after 5.  Otherwise, it was great and I will be back!",

I would definitely recommend that you stop by during their happy hour because they have 1/2 off starters. The last time i went we showed up about 10 minutes before the special ends and our waitress told us about it so we could quickly order a round of Fried Pickles for 1/2 off. I love fried pickles and i've been very happy that you can get them almost anywhere here. They were great fried pickles, not too greasy, and the ranch was deliciously smooth. Last time i had been in one of my friends got the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and i had been craving one since. I got this with a side of fries. I had just been to a yoga class so i decided to skip the bun. I'm happy i did because the bun they gave me was completely overwhelmingly large.The Buffalo Chicken was great. The house buffalo sauce that they coat it in is exactly what i wanted. It has enough spice to make it interesting but doesn't overwhelm. The fries here are fantastic. I swear they are either battered or double fried because they are perfectly crispy. I would recommend All American for anyone looking for a place to watch their favorite game or looking for a solid easy meal.",

It was like all the servers were either too hungover to function at 3pm or still drunk from the St Pattys bar crawl the day before. I don't understand how it can take half an hour to rim a glass and put vodka in it ( I mixed the Bloody Mary myself at the Bloody Mary bar).   I ordered a mimosa and watched my friends finish their entire round before a server came by for me to re-order it.   I know this isn't a fine dining establishment so I don't expect all the plates to be cleared right away or crumbs swept off the table. But if the table is covered with empty glasses or plates and there is no room to put anything down, I think its getting out of hand.  The music: It was like a middle school dance minus the dance. Creed, time of your life by green day, nickelback. You know, definitely Sunday funday music- not meant for slitting your wrists in the shower.   Lastly, why would anyone think it's acceptable to accost our group over someone else's lost pack of cigarettes and accuse us of stealing them?  Edit: sorry it wasn't all bad- there was one bartender that was awesome. Thanks!",

I have been in the service industry for over 15 years and am now a part of a management team for a popular and busy restaurant in Charlotte. I know that sometimes, servers and bartenders can be lacking in their late-night focus and it is one of my biggest peeves. You are there to work- so do your job correctly until closing. Customer service should be a priority- open to close. I usually do not get off work until 1 AM during the weekdays and I stop by AAP occasionally for a drink after a rough night and it is so refreshing to be able to have a drink without a bartender being pissy because they are doing their sidework since they are closing shortly after and they are ready to go (which seems to be the norm). Bryson greeted me with a big smile as soon as I sat down shortly after 1:15 AM- 30 minutes before last call and as she was starting her closing sidework. She was very engaging and was just as friendly to me as if I was her first customer instead of being one of her last. I greatly appreciate the welcoming attitude versus the perturbed vibe I get from some of the other bartenders when it is so close to closing, but not last call yet. Thank you so much Bryson! And to the management- hang onto her and treat her well- you have a great one!",

I could go on and on.. they also have a late night menu if come in after 11pm!! Drink specials.. great place to hang out with friends or date night!! Will definitely be back!! The menu has sooo many great options to choose from!! I had the mushroom sandwich on brioche bun with feta cheese and roasted red peppers and spinach, drizzed with balsamic!! Delish!! The tater tots were crunchy and tasty as well! They have a good philly as well! Several different types of wings if that's what you like when watching games ! All in all, no complaints here!!",

I'm in a service industry so I definitely know how customers should be treated. 12/5/15..ACC championship night. I didn't dine in here I just came over to get a takeout. I had already called several times. It would have been of someone answered and said sorry we are so busy we won't be doing takeout orders and call ins. Instead I had to walk over and be told rudely they were at capacity and the bar was too full to take my to go order. Now I'm a football fan as well and I also hosted huge events as well before too, I know it can be stressful but organization and better planning would be better to serve the public nicely. Won't be back for a while, bad taste in my mouth. I'm also from Seattle so I'm used to city life and good service.

He would not help us get us a seat from one of the several tables with empty seats (even though those seats were only holding a purse or serving as footrests for some of the patrons) nor would he offer a discount to the one person in our 14 member group that had to stand. He was also rude about it as well. We took our business elsewhere.",

Our server at our go-to Sunday football spot was out of town this weekend. So, we decided to switch things up and try AAP. Some of the group adamantly did not want a venue change. They were outvoted.  The place was PACKED. Inside and out. I didn't realize Bengals fans congregate here. It was rocking after their big win against the Patriots.   We had about ten people in our group (a group made up of current and former service industry peeps). Every single one of us was just completely blown away by the service. It seemed as though AAP had 400 people working. An empty glass wouldn't last on a table more than five minutes before someone was by to snag it. At one point, I was dropping things on the floor just to see how quickly they would be picked up. (Okay, I made the last line up, but you get my point) Our server Stacy was completely on point. Never skipped a beat the entire seven hours we were there. No one was ever drink-less. Food came out quickly.  Bravo AAP. You guys are a well-oiled machine on game day. Now if only I could say the same thing about the Panthers....",

    "text": "So this review could be biased based on the proximity of this place to my house - basically it's my version of MacLarens on HIMYM - I can walk to, enjoy myself, and walk/stumble back.  All things considered, its a great bar/pub for SouthEnd.   Tons of TVs, great service, and great space - indoors and out.  Food is probably not their strong-suit, but its nice to have the options while drinking since a lot of the places (craft breweries) are opting to go without a kitchen and you end up ordering food in from outside or going the food truck route.  Since I don't have cable at home, I like to go watch sporting events here.  It was absolutely crazy last night when the NC State Wolfpack won a buzzer beater with LSU to stay in the tournament.  I'm sure this place will do well during the tournament and all major sporting events.  Haven't gone here for a football Sunday, but definitely excited to check them out once football comes back.  Check their website for weekday specials.  I think they have appetizer specials for happy hour from 4-6.",

Once the waitress brought my check I was actually charged for the salad. I didn't feel like going through the hassle of getting the salad taken off as my stomach started to turn into knots. So I paid for my order.  Unfortunately Forty-five minutes later I was running for the bathroom as I was food poisoned.  I called the restaurant to inform the manager that I had spent the past hour in the bathroom and he refunded me the money for salad that I was no longer going to eat. I appreciated this but I felt that my entire meal should have been refunded as I spent that entire night in agony as I was running to the bathroom and my stomach was in knots.  I have no complaints with the service on the other hand, our waitress was great. Due to this unfortunate experience I won't be back.",

    "text": "If I had to sum up my experience at All American Pub in 16 words, they would undoubtedly be \"Usually, more times than not, this place gets your order wrong and the food is okay.\"  All American Pub should only be used as a place to go watch a game, have happy hour with coworkers, an after kickball drink, or getting intoxicated doing all of the above, but don't ever go there when you're hungry. I am convinced that All American Pub's business plan is focused around perpetual Bud Light draft specials so that patrons become inebriated and don't realize that their order is wrong and, if they do, they are too \"carefree\" to say anything about it.  Now, let's talk about the service, or lack thereof. Customer service at a lemonade stand is better than this place where the wait staff's overall skill level is comparable to the performance of the Carolina Panthers this past season; but, having that personnel might be a part of the business plan as well. I have visited All American Pub several times, and my order has always been wrong..from wrong sides, wrong cheese on burger, forgotten dipping sauce (big no- no) and the latest issue, drum roll please...a simple wedge salad. Ordered a wedge salad with bleu cheese crumbles separate and Caesar dressing. What came to the table was bleu cheese crumbles on the lettuce wedge with bleu cheese dressing. Who orders bleu on bleu? This is Charlotte, NC not Roquefort, France. The blue-on-blue incident was the final straw. I will only visit All American Pub for the occasions mentioned above. That being said, don't go unless you want a headache from the order accuracy, the pathetic wait staff, or from the cheap beer.",

The waitstaff was friendly and timely so that was a plus. The food was terrible so we won't be back.",

They actually used to have decent prices but I think it's turned more about profit than a good place to come hang out with friends with reasonably priced drinks and food.  Update/Response: Morgan, I appreciate the response and the Post article for context. I, however, struggle to believe this is the sole reason for the staggering price increase, considering the price increases seen across all Bottle Cap Group restaurants in Charlotte all around the same timeframe. Not to mention, the product now being provided at this establishment is half the size and double price of the wings at surrounding restaurants.   Understand the business need but, it's unfortunate to see the impact on your loyal customers.",

Big booths, very spacious, lots of tvs. We actually sat at the bar today.  Service is pretty good. The bartender was very friendly and the servers are usually very friendly and attentive.   Now onto the food. I ordered the philly cheesesteak, one of my friends the BLT with egg and the other friend the fish sandwich. We also shared the chicken nachos. Overall the food wasn't bad. It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. The portions were pretty huge, I have to say. My last few visits I've ordered and liked the wings. I think I'll revert back to that habit.   The had a nice list for drinks and had daily drink specials which is always a plus. Prices were pretty reasonable too. Some of the entrees were only a couple bucks more than the sandwiches. I hear that on weekends they move the tables aside and turn it into a dancefloor. lol  Overall I won't gush over the food. It's not bad, yet not outstanding. but if you're looking for a fun place in southend to catch a game, this place is cool for that. Decent bar food choices, even better drink specials, reasonable prices, and pretty good service too.",

    "text": "Long work day, no car and lack of groceries called for a hearty dinner near home. Looking for a cheaper meal, I turned towards AAP since I live within a block of it. I've never been there, but I have to say that place is PACKED every night of the week. No matter what time, you can usually count on two things: some Top 40 song blaring from their patio and a cornhole tournament. I have to admit, I was a little curious what all the hype was about.  I called ahead for a chicken Mediterranean sandwich with sweet potato fries to-go. I arrived upon my 20 minute ETC and took a seat at the bar. The bartenders were busy pouring drinks while another dealt with some tab argument from a, politely put, intoxicated man. It took them a little while to acknowledge me, but I get it. They're slammed. On a Tuesday. I paid within 10-15 minutes and received warm well wishes from the staff.  The sandwich was good. 3.5 stars. Put it on better bread and I'll bump it up to 4. Creamy feta cheese, roasted red peppers and a nice balsamic glaze. The fries, on the hand... you swung and missed. 1 star. Maybe it was because they were sitting on a pickle for a while, but they were downright mushy. Really disappointing.  I can see why people like to drink there. It appears very college-y, sports bar-esque but not too loud... at least not on a Tuesday. I wouldn't mind coming back on a chill weekday night, but I don't think I could hack it on their weekends.  And ladies, from a brief scan of their front bar, the place is a meat market.",

I haven't really explored this area I generally stay on South Blvd but it seems like there are a lot of nice restaurants a few streets over. Parking was pretty easy for a Friday night there is a lot past the train tracks and to the left with a parking attendant. He just asked us where we were going  and then let us in ... I'm not really sure how they regulate parking but it was FREE.99 so who cares.   Overall nice spacious pub/bar/place to watch sports. They have a general bar area, booths and high tables. There is also a patio outside but we chose to sit in a booth. I wasn't super hungry just more so came out to socialize so I ordered the large soft pretzel and a cider beer. The food and beer were pretty good but the service was a bit slow for the amount of people in there. Maybe they kick it up a notch when it's more people or a game day ?   We did notice that a different type of crowd (club like) started to come in as we were leaving around 10pm or so.",

    "text": "I have to say I was super stoked to try this place, I have always heard good things, the location is awesome, I love the south end area, but this visit left me desiring more to say in the least. So we get there and the hostess completely ignored us then was very rude.  Her only comment to us after we approached, \"you wanna table or something?\" I was literally stunned took me probably 10 seconds to respond because I was so shocked and wanted to make sure I had not misheard.  But anyway so we wait a few minutes as it was a packed house then were seated then about 7 minutes later(I timed it) a waitress approached to see if we'd been helped, no? OK so she disappeared and a few minutes later our actual waitress shows up.  We expected it would be busy so we tried to look at the menu online ahead of time to expedite the process found some things we liked and pretty much could have ordered when we were seated, BUT not today apparently game day menu chops the menu in half and excludes all dinner entrees so nothing that we had in mind was available to order...F! I get it, they are just trying to simplify everything to streamline and improve service.... as you can read, not working for them.  And seriously took the buffalo shrimp off the apps section on game day? I feel like that would be a popular game day choice and quick to make... but anyway ordered the fiery drunk, and roasted veggies as a side.  Burger was really good, could a used a little more heat, but not complaining.  Veggies were very well prepped.  Wife enjoyed her burger but the Mac and cheese sucked, I've had better boxed Mac and cheese. Beer selection is at least decent, respectable prices, good specials.  All in all food was good and priced pretty well for what it is and how much you get.  It was very loud but I don't mind plus it was a FSU viewing party so understandably a little louder than probably normal.  Cool setup really liked the place and I WANT to love this place, but good lord that is the worst service I have had in quite a while.  I'll be back to give them another shot, hopefully they have full menu and better service next time.",

    "text": "I went to All American Pub to catch a football game this past weekend because it wasn't on national TV.  First off, it looked like they removed all of the bar stools and forced everyone to stand, and it is impossible to get a table. Therefore, I spent 3.5 hours standing in front of a bar getting elbowed by drunken idiots who clearly should have been cut off.  (If a guest approaches the bar, slams his drink down out of control-- he clearly does not need to be served a round of shots).  Second-- I consider myself a decent tipper and tip after every drink I order.  I had paid with cash all afternoon and tipped each time.  The last round I ordered, I only had two fives to pay for my $5 order.  I asked the bartender to break the second five so I had change.  She said, \"Sure\" and then proceeded to ring out my order, make change for the 5 and put ALL OF IT in her tip jar.  I was previously a bartender and I would NEVER do that.  You should never expect all change to be tip-- change should go to the customer and they can determine your tip.  I then noticed that every time that same bartender took money from someone and it was less than a dollar that was owed to the customer, she banked all of it without offering the change to the customer.  If you ask me, that is theft.    I will never recommend anyone go to All American Pub on a Sunday-- unless you want to be stolen from and bombarded by a bunch of over served drunks.",

I can confidently say that it achieved the opposite in our case. The unspecified coupon, for one, turned out to only give us either Bud Light or Budweiser, and they were out of one, so we only had the one choice. Okay, it was free, but still somewhat disappointing to people who really don't like Bud Light. My personal opinion is - if you're a new place and want to convince customers to come back, don't be skimpy and draw people in with what seems like a generous offer and turns out to be the least tasty option on the beer menu.   The food took very long to come out despite an empty restaurant, and it was very unremarkable. That also goes for the place in general - everything is shiny new and pretty nice, but the only way this place can be at all interesting is if you come with very good and entertaining company that will provide fun no matter where. We came to watch a soccer game during the Euro Cup, but it was so empty and the place so overly big that it was impossible to experience a good, exciting atmosphere during the game.",

If we had not already been to taste of Charlotte this is where we would have been eating lunch! They even had a watermelon stack of some sort that had decent sized pieces of watermelon with feta cheese and other items in the middle that a woman next to us ordered. Looked fabulous! It is new - took over the building where Jillians was in South End. The bartender, Austin, was attentive and incredibly nice and fun! Could not have asked for a better bartender. The ambiance is great with lots of TVs to watch games and races.  The bar is literally right next to a light rail stop, so for the nights you cant drive - you can hit up the light rail. Win win. Music also is much better than other places, not just Katy Perry music (although I do love Katy Perry), including the Killers and Cake. Definitely come check it out! Will probably be a great place to go for Panthers tailgating! You also can't pass up the $2 mimosa and $4 Bloody Mary specials on Sunday. Yum!",

Servers said they would ask.....20 mins later still no heaters.  I went to ask the hostess if we could get the heater turned on.  Her response......my manager said we could not turn on the heaters they had to save them for TOMORROW.  WHAT?????? We ordered drinks and apps and got them pretty quickly then we ordered dinner.  Thank god we had the apps because we waited 45 mins for 3 hamburgers and some chicken tenders and then got the wrong hamburgers.  In the meantime a table of 8 that came in after us got their food in like 10 mins. We had out of towners with us and this was a poor showing for Southend.",

The customer service..not so much.  They are real janky in this area.  For example, is they want to put everything on hold to start a tab even when you're ordering a food item or a drink.  As if paying cash isn't good for them.  Number 2, takes forever for the waitresses to check up on you to see if everything is ok.  So, you want to take our cards but can't check up on us for anything needed.  Yeah, got it.  Not a bad establishment just needs re-tweaking from the customers service end...like a lot of it!

The waitress rung my card for the wrong tip; accidents happen, I know which I was completely understanding but wanted to call the manager to let him know. He didn't even care and told me he would couldn't talk at the moment and would call back. Never did. Also, a friend of mine was ordering a meal on the phone to pick up and I just remember him questioning her rudely.   I've made online orders in the past which they seem to never get right !  Or It takes foreverrrr for some of the girls working at the bar to acknowledge someone, especially when you've been waiting 15mins for your pick up order when it was suppose to be done 25 mins prior and ready to be picked up when I first walked in. I don't know how many times I've made a online order that said it would be ready at a certain time and it was never made.",

Rarely checked on and sat 15+ min with an empty beer glass on the table. Place wasn't that busy and there appeared to be plenty of servers scurrying around.   You'd think a party of 3 would tip decently but lack of attention to drink refills will always reduce my rating by at least one star.  UPDATE: WOW...Less than 10 minutes after posting this, a manager approached the table and asked if I had a Yelp account.  I replied yes, and he apologized over the lack of better service. He explained the problems the server had with a larger party.   I was very impressed at the quick response and the attention we were given.  Because of this, we will be back!! Great job to management!!!",

I love the open floor plan and the staff have been pretty consistent with good service.  So Happy Hour is from 4-6pm with half price appetizers and do yourself a favor and get the pretzel with cheese sauce! It comes our warm perfectly crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. It's an excellent start or pair with some beer!  On my last visit I ordered a salad (I know...I know) but it was actually very tasty! I got the Cobb salad with bacon, chicken, avacado, and blue cheese dressing. It was classic. I'd order it again but this place has a pretty fantastic menu! I've seen the burgers, nachos and sandwiches and they all look amazing!   I know we'll be back soon so I can't wait to try out more options!",

I wish they'd have heated the bun.  I had my fries loaded and the cheese sauce was plentiful, and creamy.  I think I'd have preferred melted cheese, but it was still good.

I guess we came at her lunch time!? Food took longer than expected and I'm not sure if it was because of the slow service or slow cooks.

It is probably a great place to catch a game because of all the Tvs but I wouldn't expect much as far as service goes.  I tried the Mac Daddy burger which was very dry even though I had it cooked medium rare.  It was a unique flavor combination with the Mac and cheese and fried jalapenos on top.

The building itself is awesome, in a really cool area, and easily accessible from the light rail. The coolest thing is that it's connected to 2 or 3 other bars so you can walk from bar to bar without ever having to go outside.   Waitresses have always been really friendly with a special shout-out to Mary who was great today. Menu could use a few more options and is tradition bar food but everything I've had has always been good!

Whether its to watch a game, drink some brew, have some wings, or just chill on the out door patio, or all of the above, its always comfortable and a fun atmosphere.  The service was great and the expected local draft beers did not disappoint.  We enjoyed sitting outside and doing some people watching on the trail that runs through town.  The train passes by every so often but is quite and not very disruptive.  Inside is huge and has a great vibe, a place I wouldn't mind spending more time actually.  Didn't get to try the food but the waitress assured us all of it was very good.  Stop in for a cold one and to watch some sports, you'll be back.",

    "text": "So I was working outside a few doors down from the All American Pub on a Sunday of all days. While working I became a little hungry, and thought I would go to the Pub to get something to eat after looking at their menu online. I saw what I wanted, walked over to the Pub on two separate occasions, and each time I was ignored by the staff. I even stood by the bar trying to get one of the 3 females waitresses attention who were working behind the bar BC only to go orders could be placed there, but they were too busy flirting with the male patrons. I would say that being ignored at an establishment is one of my biggest pet peeves when eating out. Due to their poor service, and their inattention of service, I will not ever be a customer at this establishment for it seems that my worth in this place doesn't mean anything.",

If I were to die tomorrow and I wasn't cremated, embalmed, or buried at All American Pub then I would haunt all my relatives for destroying my afterlife dreams.  Don't even get me started on the beverages, I feel like I'm drinking the blood of Christ in every Tito's and water that filtrates through my liver. Come to think of it, when Christ comes back he will no doubt enjoy the corn dog nuggets and a Drunken D as his first meal and beverage since his long awaited return at All American Pub. Countrymen, bed wenches and peasant serfs, the day has come where an establishment embodies the desired totalitarian utopia we have yearned for through countless pillaging and imperialism. Sacrifice your lambs, dance in the streets, let us rejoice for All American Pub!  Madison the bartender is a ray of sunshine on a dismal day.",

Another great thing about All American Pub is that they have daily drink specials which are usually a great deal. A few Sundays ago I went and they had 2$ mimosas! So this is definitely something to keep an eye out for!  As far as the food, I wasn't extremely impressed. It was less than I expected, I got a buffalo chicken wrap and I almost couldn't eat it because I kept biting into fatty pieces of chicken. And the portion size was much smaller than I expected as well.  I had been here previously and had a burger which wasn't terrible so if I were to go back I'd probably stick to that again.   If you like football, this is the place to go. During football season every Sunday All-American pub is packed so if you do show up throughout the day you'll be on a wait. But it's usually not too long, about 15-20 minutes and the service is pretty quick for how packed it usually is. It has it's ups and downs, but overall not one of my favorite places.",

    "text": "I have been to American Pub with the same friend about seven times, five of those seven times have just been terrible experiences yet kept coming back because I would always find an excuse to give them another chance. Whether it be for the delicious french fries and carolina burger or I understand as a fellow server and having worked in customer service since I was 16. I know what it's like to get busy and to have a 40 minutes ticket wait or to have the waitress not tell you when you get sat. However, almost every time my friend and I come in our server takes at least 5 minutes to come greet our table in an empty restaurant (There is a server rule: thirty seconds to get to your table and greet them) and once they got our orders they would check on us about twice before dropping the check. One time we stood at the entrance waiting for someone to greet us or at least tell us to have a seat where ever and they'd have someone to us shortly, without even a passing by bartender saying anything to us we finally left. My same friend and I visited tonight for a quick meal and were surprised to see it almost empty with no more than 30 guests in the restaurant. The hostesses were sweet and inviting and of course had not a problem sitting us, the problems started after we sat down. We sat there for a little over five minutes before a nice red headed girl dressed as a Teenaged mutant ninja approached us and asked if anyone has been with us yet, we said no and she got us waters and let us know our server will be there shortly. Well it wasn't shortly. It took quite a while for her to come and take our appetizer/entree orders. We waited about 30 minutes in a nearly empty restaurant for our appetizer alone. I'm unsure if the Buffalo Shrimp come served cold, if so that's a stupid idea with it being breaded and spicy, if not our shrimp and bottom of the plate were cold. The edge of the plate was warm so it's like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for too long. I'm guessing our server forgot and the cooks didn't let anyone else know to run the food....which is not how it has been done in any restaurant I have worked at. A completed order in the window gets ran with notice to the tables server, that's that. We had them take away the shrimp and our server didn't approach us at all about the situation but once to drop off our burgers. She didn't ask if there was anything she could do, however another server in a leopard jumpsuit did and was extremely apologetic for a mistake that wasn't hers and another girl took away our buffalo shrimp while she walked pass. The GM John came and spoke with us, he handled it well and even paid for our food as we let him know that my friend is a restaurant cook and I am a server so we know how it works and this wasn't working. By that time we no longer wanted to waste time there and left. I have zero excuses now, my tables get snatched if I don't take them within 2 minutes and mine along with my fellow servers asses would be chewed if we just left food in the expo window without asking for a table to go to or the server to run it. It's unacceptable and I wish their service wasn't shitty because I love the food.",

The service has been completely horrible...I hate doing this, but Taylor is perhaps the worst server I have ever had. She was inattentive and gone for the majority of our time there. When taking orders, she would take 1 at a time and then leave because she couldn't remember more than that. It got to the point where we decided to get up and sit at the bar.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the first time I've experienced bad service there...this time just happened to be the worst. We have been there when it is slow, and the servers were too busy hanging out at the bar rather than waiting tables.   The reason for the 2 stars is because of the service we received at the bar.

The place is great for sports junkies, there isn't a bad seat in the house if you want to watch sports. We settled on a 2-Top in the bar area. Megan was our server and she did a fantastic job! I went with the triple decker club and curly fries. The sandwich was great- plentiful meats and cheese. The curly fries were hot and well seasoned. The beers were cold and Megan constantly checked in on us.  As the clock ticked closer to 1pm kickoff the place got super busy with a great mix of fans. We were there until halftime, so several hours. We never felt rushed or left unattended. Overall great pregame experience! Will be  Visited again last Sunday (4/21/19) another good visit.

During the week from 4-6, they have half off appetizers. I noticed the next day that we were charged full price, so I decided to call to see what happened. Of course no one answered the phone! The only reason they are receiving 2 stars instead of one is because my friend really liked her drink. Unfortunately, my experience here was an overall let down, and I don't think I'll be back.",

However, if that is your scene, it is a fun place to be!  I love their apps, especially the wings and the \"fries, fries, fries:\" a delectable assortment of curly fries, sweet potato fries, and seasoned fries. Yum!   They also have good deals on drinks and weekly specials.  I love their Bloody Mary bar during brunch!  Service can be hit or miss, but it is definitely a fun place to come for games!",

Still the atmosphere here is great for sports fans especially on college football Saturdays and NFL Sundays.

I would highly recommend their fried pickles, Mac & cheese, corn pups (mini corn dogs!), triple bang shrimp, & soft pretzels... all were so delicious! We just stuck to appetizers. My one friend has been there numerous times before and was so excited to have the cheesesteak egg rolls- however sadly they were taken off the menu. The waitress recommend steak bites- which were so different and were not that good. They were the only thing that was not finished. It was quiet on that Sunday and the atmosphere was different than I would assume on other days or night, but I loved the sports feel it had all around.",

The \"dining room\" and patio smelled of stale cigarette smoke (yes, even outside).  The music was loud and was a horrible mix for any time of day - seriously, we bounced non-stop from Kid Rock to Whitney Houston and the like.  There was no one (hostess or otherwise) at the door, and one guy even walked away after no one greeted him, so we had to ask the only bartender where we could sit.  The service was slow.  We were so disappointed that we left after 1/2 a beer and went to a very nearby brewery.   We won't return.",

It was clearly a frozen piece of fish thrown into the deep fryer, so we pretty much paid $13 for french fries. I ordered a prime rib, considering it was Wednesday and that was their special. I ordered it medium. When I was served my meal, it was a thin piece of prime rib that was overcooked. It was good, but it any lacked flavor or spices. I also opted to upgrade from the broccoli to the spinach. My spinach was nothing more then steamed spinach with no seasoning, no bacon, no garlic, nothing! it was completely bland and gross. All said and done, it was not worth the $18 that they charge for it. I don't think I will ever eat an entree at this place again.  I might go back and try a burger or a sandwich, maybe they're better at that. This place is clearly not the place to eat entrees, The food was very disappointing.",

The hostess is usually very friendly and so are the servers but they are extremely slow. It always seems to take us forever to get any food. We get pitchers of beer, and a lot of the time it will be flat or just taste terrible. They always say it's because the leg is out and they need to change it but for that to happen at least 3 times to us seems a little bit fishy. They do have a ton of tvs so it's great for games but it gets so packed in there during any big game that you never can get a seat. The food is pretty good. If only they could get better servers and get their food out faster and their beer figured out it would be a great spot.",

However, the service at All American Pub is horrible! One of my first experiences was the bartender poured my draft beer, and before handing it to me, wiped the glass with a dirty bar towel. Oh heck NO! The next time I went there, our drinks kept running dry and there was no site of our waitress. Then my friend got his food, and it was not what he ordered. This past visit, we attended an event, and when we tried to join our friends at the table, the staff said we couldn't sit there. What?!?!?!  We had to literally persuade the staff  to let us sit with our friends and order drinks and food! It's the craziest thing! Please management, if you're reading this, schedule a staff meeting and address the service!",

I even complimented to the waitress how awesome indeed that sandwich was.  The food came out fresh and hot and I don't really have any complaints about this place for a first time visit.  Food was stellar, our glasses stayed full and people were relatively friendly that worked there.  Definitely up there for a random place we picked out.  Check em out if you are in South End.

We waited at least 30 minutes before our waitress took our drink orders. Being the patient people we are, we did wait since friends were on our way. We asked about drink specials and the waitress seemed so confused. 15 minutes later our drinks arrived. Our friends did as well. They went to the bar to order drinks since we had warned them about the server. The 10 top was now available so we did switch over to that and a different waitress. We recieved much better service after that.",

The menu wasn't overly extensive, but had a good selection of burgers, chicken and other sandwiches, and a few salads.  I ordered the pulled pork BBQ, but they brought me the cheesesteak in error.  I was surprised by this as there were very few diners in the room.  When I saw how it was prepared, it looked pretty tasty, choppy and filling, I kept it to try.  I was glad I did as it was pretty delicious, and the grain bun was fresh, too.  The fries were good, slightly crispy, with a pickle on the side.  I thought overall it was quite underwhelming and unimpressive for the size and decor of the restaurant.  Nothing fancy about the food, especially for the price.

The layout of the bar/restaurant hasn't changed much since the old Jillian's which used to be in this space.  There's a few additions to note the name of the pub.    I initially sat at the bar but being a tall person, I realized the bar seating is a bit uncomfortable for a tall person and moved to one of the nearby 2-seater pub tables.    The beer menu consists of craft, domestic and import beers.  There are NC beers represented here but the only Charlotte beers are from OMB.    The food menu includes all the pub standards,...burgers, apps, sandwiches, salads and a few other things.  According to the staff, the burgers are supposed to be good here but I opted for a Black and Blue chicken wrap with fries and a pickle spear.  The food came out quickly and the wrap was quite tasty.  The fries were a bit disappointing and I had to smother them with watered down ketchup to make them more appealing.    I was served mostly by the bartender unless she was busy and then someone else helped her.    Overall a decent place to have a beer or a bite after work or before a game.",

On this particular Thursday evening, they had a promotion going on that included beer and wings.   The beer was straight - bud lite and miller lite draft from a piTCHer - no complaints here.   The wings were surprisingly good for a new establishment.  The sauce, a simple HOT sauce, was tasty, but it was the sweet, not the heat that made this sauce.  I def recommend the wings if you are looking for something to try.  I am anxious to return to sample other items on the menu.  The service was excellent.  Not only was the wait staff easy on the eyes, but they were friendly, professional and quick to refill anyone that needed beer or water.    The interior is cool.  I like that they have plenty of screens hanging throughout the bar.  I also like that they have a long bar, with plenty of seating.   Overall, I must say AAP has peaked my interest.  So far they are off to a good start with a solid mix of food, service & ambiance.  This is a place I would def like to try again, and a place I might consider when looking for a sports bar in the area.",

Really fun, chill atmosphere. I have been going here at least once a week for over a year and have never had a complaint.  Today I made a to-go order for the first time because I was craving All American's sweet potato fries (they are incredible) and they told me my order would be ready in 10 minutes. They took a longer than ten minutes, and didn't charge for the order because of the delay.  I didn't think I could ever love this place more than I already did!",

Wanted a flight at the bar, you can only get the beers they offer that day in a flight.  First time for that. Not cool.  Then there was the food.  Ordered the BBQ, cause that's what the waitress said was best.  It came out and had no taste at all.  Didn't eat hardly any of it and waitress never even asked if I like it. So I order more sauce to try to eat it.  That didn't help either and they charged me $.25 for a tiny container of sauce on a $13.00 BBQ plate.   Wth?  Buddy just got wings and even they were cold.     I told the waitress about not liking it (which I never ever do) and they credited me $6.50 off out total bill.  If they had not changed me the $.25 for the extra sauce, I would have never said a word.",

So I came here last Friday with my man and he's just talking about how this place has pretty good burgers and it's good during lunch... well I guess that I may be the case, but for dinner... I thinks not.   First we get seated immediately and wait 10 minutes before I had to get up and stopped the manager walking by to let him know that no one has come to our table. Then a brown-skinned dude tatted up was friendly enough to say he'll take care of us as I told him no one has brought our drinks after another 10 minutes. We get our order (mind you, we know what we want as soon as she comes to take our drink order, because she took so long) and then it's crap. Now.... I know a pub will more than likely be known for it's good beer... maybe some appetizers; but they could at least get a burger right. I wasn't even asked how I wanted it (I like mine medium btw). So this burger is mad dry. I mean dusty dry, no juice, no pink, no motivation to eat this thing.   Yea... 3 stars for the dude comping our order... we only paid for one meal. Huuuu... such a disappointment though.",

The wait staff is great, the food is good. The mac and cheese is decent and I only say that cause it's 'sister bar\" Whiskey Warehouse has amazing mac and cheese. Not sure why they don't use the same recipe. Or maybe they do and I just had it on an off day. They also have really good sweet potato fries. One of the best I've had in Charlotte. Pair that with some pure honey for dipping and you've got a great side dish.",

We had no chance of getting a table and the hostess said one wouldn't be available until after the game. (So, just note, that if you want a table here for a big game, come super early!!). We headed to the bar and were content with standing and watching with everyone else in the bar area. They have a good amount of beers on tap and Thursdays is $3 NC beer night. Yay for Shotgun Betty!   Didn't eat food on this specific occasion but we have eaten here many times and the food is pretty decent bar food.

    "text": "Came here during a panthers game with a group of friends. The waitress was very concerned our tabs wouldn't be accounted for since we were all moving around throughout the bar, but we assured her everything would be paid. At the end of the night, myself and 3 friends asked to close out. We had to guess how many drinks we had, she charged us (after a VERY long waiting period) and we left. Then, about an hour later, we got a call from our remaining friend at the bar. He had been charged EVERYTHING. She forgot all of our food and a few of our drinks and stuck him with the items she forgot to add to our tabs. He was left with $160 to be accountable for. Of course we paid him back and got everything figured out, but it should have never ever been an issue. Our tabs should have been correct the first time as to avoid sticking our friend with a massive bill at the end. It was the waitress' mistake and there was absolutely no ownership on her part. Unprofessional, frustrating and absurdly inappropriate.   EDIT 11/4:  I'm going to amend this review from 1 star to 3. The most recent time I was at All American the waitress came up and apologized. I understand accidents happens and everyone is entitled to a bad day every now and then. Especially on busy game days!",

The dressing tasted like watered down mayonnaise minus the taste of mayonnaise.  The chicken had as much flavor as the mayonnaise dressing.  Ordered anchovies on the side.  Got anchovies that weren't traditional anchovies used in a Caesar salad.  They were just plain anchovies packaged in water.  Either this place buys extremely cheap ingredients or the kitchen manager has no idea how to cook.  If you like beer and good looking women servers, this place is good.  But, the food is sub sub par.  Not my first time eating here.  That's why I ordered the Caesar.  I figured they couldn't screw that up.  I guess I was wrong again.  Won't be back.",
