    "text": "We visited for the first time for Valentine's Day.  The decor is warm & cozy, rustic, definitely a lot of reclaimed stuff.  We felt like we had our own \"space\".  The wait staff was very attentive and tuned in to when our next course should arrive.    I ordered an Old Fashioned made with Gin.  Figured I might not get that opportunity again.  It was surprisingly good.  I followed with a Triple C Stout.  Bread with Freshly Whipped Butter/Cinnamon.  It is wonderful.  Too good, really.  Filling up on bread is not a good idea.  First Course: Oestra Caviar, Sunchoke Crisps. Watercress Creme Fraiche, Yellowfin Tuna Tartar, Baby Parsley.  Makes it sound like a caviar dish.  It isn't, really.  It's really a nice hunk of tuna with a few specks of caviar on it.  No matter, it was delicious, but I think I might have named it other than \"Happy Valley Caviar\".  No mention of where the Yelowfin Tuna came from.  Second Course: Oysters with Texas Pete and Sour Cream \"Caviar\", Sunflower shoots.  Awesome if you like oysters.  Third Course: Scallops, Potato Salad, Baby Bok Choy, Applewood Bacon Vinaigrette. Started feeling like it was time to stop eating now.  Fourth Course: Tomato Braised Chicken Leg, Caroline Gold Rice, Baby Spinach. OK, so can I just take the rest of it home?  Fifth Course: Angus Ribeye, Blue Potato Puree, Carrots, Sorrel, Au Jus. Cause yeah, I really needed a second entree.  Mama?  Sixth Course: Cow's Milk Brie, Beet Puree, Crispy Flatbread, Baby Greens. Because when you are stuffed you want a big ol' hunk of cheese.  Cheese was delicious and we asked where it was from but we never got an answer.  Seventh Course: Spiced Cake, Cinnamon Streusel, Whipped Cream, Mallow, Chili Threads. Regret not boxing this, but at this point I thought I might explode.  So - was it good?  Yes, awesome.  Here are a few thoughts...  With this much food, it would have been more romantic to \"share\", especially on Valentine's Day.  I don't think this was sized properly.  I know for the price you don't want us to share, but if we can't eat it all...maybe too much is too much?   Honestly half of what I had plus a small pour of each \"pairing\" would have been sized and priced right.  I know you can't send anyone home hungry but I felt bloated like Elvis by the time we rolled out of there.  We are looking forward to going back.  The food was very well prepared and presented, and the service was top-notch.  Maybe just a few bites from a regular menu this next time tho.",

    "text": "Finally made it to Heirloom after being prompted by Groupon, and I'm glad that I did. The wife and I also were able to see a part of Charlotte that we've never visited before. Now Heirloom is a little off the beaten path, but maybe the space and location were perfect and couldn't be passed up. The outside building is unassuming to say the least. The decor and atmosphere inside is reminiscent of an old lodge or rustic cabin. Either way, we came here to eat, so let's talk about the food.  We each opted for the 7 course meal and while our server explained to us the whole deal with meal options, I think that you can pretty much do whatever you want as far as options. To that point, you can order individual dishes a la carte, so really you can do whatever. Sadly, my first beer option was tapped out by the time that I ordered, but they do have some good NC brews on tap and in bottles. Actually all their beers, wines and spirits are North Carolina products from what I could see. I thoroughly enjoyed my Fullsteam Cack-a-lacky and the wife ordered a cocktail but it was bar tender's choice or a mystery cocktail. Let me explain. Basically she picked the spirit that she wanted, bourbon in this case and a flavor profile and voila, the mixologist crafts you a cocktail. Needless to say, she was happy with her drink.  As I said above, we each opted for 7 courses, which wound up being a lot of food. The timing of food coming out was perfect to give us some time to digest before the next course came out. It also made for a longer dining experience, so plan on being at the restaurant longer the more courses you choose. Some courses that we both chose were the potato soup, a bay scallops dish and a trout dish. The scallops with the grits were very good and flavorful; the trout was also great, but the accompanying blue potatoes were devoid of any seasoning and kind of fell flat. Both the wife and I agreed on the last statement. We also both agreed that the potato soup was a strange preparation with a consomme added to the potatoes and other ingredients. It definitely was not for us. For my other courses, I chose a tomato salad, clams, duck ramen and a duck breast dish. The clams were ok with good broth, while the tomato salad and duck ramen were amazingly flavorful and satisfying, probably my 2 favorite dishes. The duck breast, which was my last course was good but then again it was under seasoned. The wife enjoyed her salad greens, tofu dish and she wolfed down her dessert, so I'm thinking that was a good sign.   So all in all, a great first visit to heirloom overall. The service was by committee, while we did have a primary server, but everybody was very knowledgeable on the menu and helpful throughout the evening. I would certainly like to return, and they seem to have a lot of events and even cooking classes that could be very interesting.",

    "text": "Ok, I had to wait and think on this place a bit before I reviewed it. Loved the food and the concept but the price was a bit .....yes..its up there....high. The courses and food was great. I enjoyed most of the courses. We shared the 12 course between the two of us. Love the start with the fresh herbs with the butter but it should have been mixed in . Maybe ask if the clients lie salted since you are mixing it fresh...just a thought. Some of the courses were hard to split. Would say the soup was the hardest.  The whole on NC was fun just its just a little hard on some things since we don't grow olive trees in NC. But I will say we use local when we can. Love that you carry local wines like Raffaldini. But my whole problem is the cost . If you charged a bit less the place would be mobbed. The music did not reflect the price of the meal. I would have though instrumental would have been appropriate. We were also seated in the corner so we could not see anything and the place was empty. I would have liked to book my family for Christmas eve but they are closed. Then the thing is they are in the middle of nowhere and charge like 300.00 for dinner.  so I liked it but with those prices will not be back for a really long time. I loved the staff and liked the concept I think they just need to lower the cost a bit to draw a crowd. Would I return, sure, if I was not paying the bill or if it was a super special occasion. I had a groupon but it was a drop in the bucket compared to the bill. A dinner for 2 is going to be over 200.00 without even thinking. But again, the food was really good",

Had heard great reviews of the 9, 10, 12 course options and there the customer had choices. I think at the least even with the 6 course meal that the customer should be offered choices for each course.",

The noise was overwhelming. Each of the tables were full, but there weren't any large parties that could justify the noise level. We tried sitting next to each other, but that didn't help. I would like to suggest something is done to control the noise. On to the food....I think it may have been ok..but the portions were VERY small and the flavor just didn't stand out as much as I would like. The wine selection was limited to local wineries, which I appreciate, but just didn't help the situation. I support the farm to table effort and I assume this restaurant does well, as the lot is full on the weekends..it just wasn't great for us.",

Heirloom completely blows away the old tenants fare and, well, other restaurants in the area with their eclectic menu items, farm decor (which major parts of the decor were taken straight from their barn), and quality service.  We've had dinner or brunch on four occasions already and we'll be back for more.  Reconstructed Eggs Benedict w Pork Belly is a fave. As well as, the Fried Chicken and Waffle; also the cheese platter. Next time, I'm pretty sure that we'll get the tasting menu.  I'm glad that \"we\" finally have something in the area that serves farm to fork in a nice atmosphere and friendly service. It's been a long time comin'",

My husband and I took my parents for my father's birthday last year, and it was amazing for all of us. My mom and I are vegetarian, while my husband dislikes most vegetables, and my dad will eat just about anything. But we were all satisfied with every dish that was brought out. The experience pushed us to try things we never would have tried otherwise, mostly because the ingredients were so unique. You will not find a dining experience like this anywhere else in Charlotte. I certainly appreciate that everything is sourced locally, including the alcohol. In addition to the terrific food, it's great knowing that you're helping support the NC agricultural community.",

From the moment we walked in the door we were impressed.   Our waiter was attentive (not obnoxious) and extremely knowledgeable about the menu and knew where each food came from in NC. We told him we liked to grow our own vegetables and appreciated the high quality/locally sourced menu.  The chef came over as we were finishing our meal, a impressive young man with a love for quality food, locally grown.  The bread was homemade on site. It paired perfectly with the fresh herbs and olive oil offered to us.  Our appetizer was asparagus wrapped in local bacon (not smoked - a treat) with a perfect hollandaise sauce. ($8)  I had the homemade sausages (italian, chorizo and lamb) with turnip roots and a wonderful greens salad with an absolutely divine dressing. ($26)  My husband had the filet, cooked medium rare with asparagus and sweet potato fries.  His comment:  \"The best steak I have EVER had.\"  He allowed me a few bites and I agree. ($30)  For dessert we chose the strawberry souffle set atop a lovely lemon cake with a side of strawberry \"caviar\" underneath a strawberry ice. ($9)  The ambiance was lovely, inviting and quaint. The wait staff was attentive. The food was spectacular, presentation was spectacular. The wine was excellent.  We will be back and we will bring friends.",

Not everything was perfect--a couple items were not at all appetizing--but I took this to reflect a venture into new areas. We did the full 12 course tasting menu, which was plenty of food and a wide variety of flavored and textures. Particular highlights: the egg yolk pasta with rabbit, spinach, and truffles; ginger and honey panna cotta; duck breast with cabbage and spaetzle.  On the less satisfying side: the farmstead cheese was a little too barnyard flavored for my taste, and the tobacco chicken feet had great flavor but I just can't stomach the whatever-it- is that you eat off the feet.  Service was very attentive. Ambience was neutral. We were placed in the darkest corner of the room so the visual effect was muted.  Overall, worth a try.",

However, I hate to say that this restaurant has gone down hill in service and even flavor...but especially service...from servers to management and dare I say ownership who was also there relaxing behind the bar...not focusing on the dishes going out or service. Our waiter took 28 minutes from us being seated to say something to us before we even received water, ~40 minutes to get bread, all the while the manager on duty was aware we were seated. Then the real show happened when our waiter called my pregnant wife hangry after she asked for bread (since it took him forever walking around aimlessly prior to that). Only after I asked for a different server, did the manager attempt to scape up the mess of their service, but to no avail. He said he would comp our drinks, but somehow we still managed to pay for everything...drinks and all. Do not waste your time or taste buds...there are too many other great places around to invest in. I'm so sad that this is my review...because I really was excited to visit heirloom again, but just not worth it. Do yourself and NC a favor and support other businesses that actually care about their product and patrons.",

The tasting menu was six courses consisting of a salad, soup, two mains, a cheese dish, and, of course, dessert. The beeswax mozzarella salad was very good and fresh.  The soup was a Bermuda fish chowder and was also excellent. For the 3rd course, I opted for fried chicken. I probably wouldn't get that again. It had nice flavor, but the chicken was dry. Ribeye steak was the 4th course and was amazing! One of the best steaks I've ever eaten. Our dessert was a turtle cheesecake which was more than enough to share (especially after the feast preceding it!) and was excellent. My wife enjoyed her crab cakes. They had jalapenos on top, so expect some heat with those. If you're thinking of getting the tasting menu, budget about 2 hours for dinner, but I highly recommend it. All in all, it was a great evening. The service was also very good. With each dish that came out, they gave a little explanation about the ingredients which are all locally grown. Our waiter also gave us good suggestions as were trying to decide what to get.",

    "text": "Very disappointed!  Given the awesome reviews and great press I was expecting a meal that would knock it out of the park.  I loved the decor and initial attention from the staff.  Our waiter was very attentive at first and well versed on both the menu and wine list.  Things went south after we ordered.  I selected the 7 course tasting menu and my fiance got 3 courses.  We both got a tomato bisque as a first course which was good if not uninspired.   How ver there was easily a 30 minute lull between that and the next course, without so much as a check in from our waiter.  At this point, probably because I had more courses than my date, they started bringing mine out in twos rather than individually.  I found this odd and rather off putting.  At this point it seemed the rush was on and I scarfed it all down.  I got a good mustard green salad, followed by a bay scallop dish, the presentation of which far surpassed the mediocre taste.  This was followed by a rather bland catfish dish, a beef vindaloo that was a great concept but fell short, an ok cheese plate, and a very good chocolate mousse with chiles.  While some of the dishes were good, the meal was overall somewhat boring and uninspired.  I appreciated that they only use NC products, but this made the wine list weak.   I asked the waiter to select a good bottle since I am not familiar with NC wines, and he brought us a Petit Verdot that was bland and just ok at best.  Te service was not very attentive after the first 10 minutes in the restaurant.    Again, not that anything was bad,but I don't understand the hype, and it was definitely not worth the drive from Charlotte.  I will not be returning to Heirloom.",

Here is what we discovered:  Avett Brothers music being played- keepin' it local.  Decorated with the owner's home estate decor- as in the barn!  Chicken and Dumplings so delicious!! Homemade Sausage was good - The Pork Belly... Fantastic! Elaine ordered the fish, and it was the star entree!! I had the Angus filet. It was good.  Probably a bit tough for some filet connoisseurs.   I liked it! For dessert Elaine enjoyed the Blueberry Shortcake. Almost as good as her own homemade shortcake. I had the Chocolate Cake. And it was divine!  North Carolina sourced ingredients, wine and liquor (except tequila and Scotch).  Regarding accessibility, my good friend Elaine, uses a wheelchair at all times. The bathroom stalls (I checked the men's room. Same deal.) are not wide enough, nor deep enough to accommodate a person using a wheelchair, to get all the way in the stall and close the stall door. Also, to use the toilet, it takes a 180 degree transfer. Something many disabled wheelchair users just can't do. And once transferred, the wheelchair would be in the way to close the door. No privacy, with the stall door wide open.  Just not accessible!    The alcove to get to the restrooms seems large enough that the wall could be moved put, to modify the stalls to meet ADA guidelines.",

    "text": "I experienced this restaurant during restaurant week and am excited to get back and experience their tasting menu.  Service: The best I've experienced in Charlotte. Their staff is super knowledgeable, speak well and are just fun to be around. I've never had a waiter shake my hand at the end of the meal and tell me to come back. Excellent service from the hostess, to the bartender, to the bread man, to the wait staff.  The bread cart: The guy pulled the bread cart up to the table and offered the bread of the day. He chopped some fresh herbs and added some olive oil and an amazing aroma permeated our table. The bread is heated with stones and steam and it warms the soul.  Cocktails: They have an array of cocktails but I recommended the Trust Me cocktail. You tell the waiter what you like and don't like and let the bartender come up with a concoction. Their prices for drinks are a little steep, but what the hell. Enjoy.  The food: Excellent creativity. All the food is locally sourced except for the citrus and the olive oil. I love the freshness of the food, not to mention my friend said it was the best pork she's ever had. The pork fell off the bone. No need for a knife. The only sad part about this trip is that I left my favorite scarf. Although they said they'd hold it for a week, they are only open in the evenings and it's a hike to get there. I've lost a scarf for an excellent meal. Seems like a fair trade.  I will be back!!!!",

I got the steak and it was well worth it. I've been to all of these other \"steak\" places in Charlotte and this was probably the best steak I've had in a long time. It was definitely a top 5 best steak I've ever had. The service was good also not the best but pretty close. I really love how they get their produce locally and they're always doing something to give back to the community. Highly Highly recommend. Great Job!",

I had just come from yoga, my hair was a wreck, and honestly, some places have treated me differently when I look like that... Not Heirloom!  From their gracious host to their wait staff to their bread cart guy... Everyone treated me like gold!  I ordered the \"I Trust You\" cocktail, and the bartender made me what is hands down the most wonderful spin on an Old Fashioned I've ever tasted!  I know there were some very special in-house bitters with fig in there... suffice it to say... I had two. :D  As I said, we were there for Restaurant Week so I had the Salem Hills Beef Carpaccio as my app which was local, flavorful, and served on a bed of fresh crunchy clover sprouts; I had the NC Barrel Fish Brandade which was a burst of flavors without being overpowering... it filled me up with that warm stew-like goodness; and then I had the Peanut Butter Cheesecake with Merlot Turkish Delight for dessert...   I would LOVE to come back to this restaurant for a special occasion to experience their full tasting menu.    I love that everything I ate with the exception of any citrus items were locally (NC) sourced.  I love that our waiter, the bread cart guy, and the host were all so very personable and kind that none of us wanted the meal to end.  This is not a restaurant for those seeking out meat and potatoes (not that there's anything wrong with that), but if you're looking for an EXPERIENCE of flavors, colors, textures, and tastes within your meal you could look all over and not do better than this place!  Thanks Heirloom!!! I'll be back!",

My entree was overcooked - dry chicken, mac and cheese was hard and inedible. Because our food was so long in coming I did not order a replacement entree which would likely not arrive until after our party had finished eating.  Our server was inattentive and really did nothing to try and compensate for the poor experience.  When the check was presented, I was surprised to see a minimal discount and had to request additional compensation.  I was told that the check was already \"closed out\" but I would see a $20 credit on a separate transaction.  I doubt that we will return to this restaurant based on this experience.",

    "text": "This was my first time at Heirloom, and it will probably be my last. I have been wanting to eat at a farm to take restaurant in Charlotte for a while, but Heirloom was underwhelming.   On their website it states to call 24 hours before if you want to do the tasting menu and have dietary restrictions. So that's what we did. My husband called the day before to inform them that we don't eat pork. The maitre d said that was fine and that the chef would take care of it.   When we arrived, we were seated at a dark corner table, which had limited view of the restaurant. Our waiter came over and \"informed\" us that the trading menu for the night was based around pork, and that someone should have told us that when we called... He then said that \"they would figure it out.\" I thought the whole point of calling a day prior was so the chef had a chance to prepare accordingly.   Our first course was brought out and it was the Kale salad. Being that our waiter had told us that everything had been handled at this point,  we figured we were good to go... hardly. There was bacon in our  salad! The waiter apologized and I saw him speaking with the manager, but he didn't come over. The next course was purple potato soup, which wasn't great. It reminded me of the old fashioned Campbell's tomato soup. The runner said it was vegetarian, but I later saw on their a la carte menu that it has pork... Third course was Chicken and dumplings... Definitely not the best Chicken and dumplings I've ever had, and again I got a peice of pork which I wondered if it was intentional at this point bc according to the menu the chicken and dumplings had no pork in them.   I will say that our entree was very good, although mine was a tad overcooked. The goose surpassed my expectations and was the only that we had that wasn't on the a la carte menu.   Dessert came, which was before the cheese plate I might add... and that was finally when the manager came over to express his apologies and offer us a glass of champagne... it really felt like a \"too little, too late\" type of gesture.   Normally I would have gone off about how the whole thing was handled, but I wasn't in the right frame of mind for that.   I will say that our waiter was very attentive and pleasant the whole night.    I wish I could say that our experience had been better. I was expecting great things.",

The service was fantastic. Our server was incredibly friendly, informative, and attentive. We ordered a bottle of red wine made in Asheville which was excellent and each LOVED what we ordered: the fried chicken, game ravioli, and fish with vegetables. We intentionally packaged up our meals with some room to spare so we could each enjoy a dessert masterpiece by Chef Ann. Chocolate cake with raspberry sauce and thin mint ice cream, apple cake, and carrot cake. We left very happy and excited for the following day when we could eat the leftovers! Next time I visit Charlotte I'll definitely be making my way here to enjoy another fantastic meal.",

I loved the concept of local farm to fork food and the menu sounded great! However my experience here was mediocre at best.   The food: I got the oysters Carolinafellar app and they were pretty good! Boyfriend got the BLT sliders. The sturgeon bacon was also pretty good but the bread they were on was stale and falling apart with every bite. I got the fried \"hen\" entree and it was decent, but bland so nothing special. Bf got the ravioli. He hated it. I tried a bite and it was pretty flavorless and the pasta was hard. For dessert I got the angel food cake which much like my entree was okay but nothing special. Bf got the peach pudding and omg I can't even describe how foul that tasted. It must have been rancid or something but it was just awful. My bf eats like a vacuum cleaner and even he refused to eat it.   The service: I could tell right off the bat our server was struggling. He touched base with us briefly but didn't come to take our order until about 8 mins after we were seated. Then the cocktails took about 15 minutes to come out after we did order them. I've served before for many years so although sure timely service is always preferable, I understood he was busy. What did bother me though, was when he came to take our order he kind of just came up and asked what we wanted. I didn't think anything of it at first, except that it was a little frustrating that he gave vague, brief answers to a couple questions I asked about menu items. However, when the table next to us got sat, our server went through a whole spiel about the menu with details and information that were not offered to us in the slightest. The bread came out after apps, again not a huge deal I understood he was busy, but the table next to us got offered honey butter with their bread while we didn't even see him again in time to request any butter at all. Then 20 more minutes later our entrees came out. Dessert took well over 30 minutes after our entrees were picked up. Long waits aren't the biggest deal to me when you can tell a restaurant it busy but our server didn't even come by our table at all until the last 5 minutes of our wait for dessert where he mentioned the long wait and said it shouldn't be much longer.   Overall it was just a big letdown. Judging from other reviews it seems as if restaurant week is not the time to come here. Maybe they don't put as much effort in due to reduced costs? It's a shame because it's such a great opportunity to reach new clientele. Sadly though, I don't see any reason why I would ever return here or recommend anyone else to after my experience. I'm just glad I came during restaurant week and didn't pay a higher price for such an underwhelming meal. It felt like a waste of money even at the lower cost as well as a waste of what was supposed to be a nice date night.",

The fried chicken chips and pickles were tasty and the cheese and meat board as well. I did like they were generous on the cheese which usually is not the case. I got the fried chicken and my husband the steak. He loved his but the fried chicken was eh. First for $20 you should get more than a chicken tender sized white piece. Rest was dark meat which I hate. Even still had very little flavor other than fried. I did try the Brussels only husbands plate and those were yummy. The Mac and cheese is good, different. The slaw probably was the best item in my plate. We also ordered the corn bread which I would pass on really didn't have much flavor to it, no one out of the 4 loved it. The odd thing was after our apps came the waitress was no existent. We needed more bread for the cheese and I had to flag down someone else. The person that was checking on us was not our server. After waiting forever for dessert menus we decided to order the peach ice cream but for some reason they said they could only do a milkshake due to how hot it was out? Odd since we are in an air conditioned restaurant... so we got it and was tiny but also had zero flavor it seriously tasted like a thick glass of milk. Overall I don't think I would return as service was eh food was average and definitely was not a $100 plus meal.",

We first went when they were only serving a tasting menu, we really enjoyed this format, the chef really did a great job with local \"foraged\" menu items.   Recently, they have added a regular entree list while keeping the tasting menu, so you can go crazy, or go comfort with what you like.    Go for: 1. Great locally sourced ingredients and inventive preparations. 2. Treat yourself to a cocktail from the bar 3. Try something with honey 4. Duck confit 5. Fried chicken  Tonight I had the NC seafood special, swordfish.  B.E.S.T swordfish I've ever had, seriously!  I'm an amatuer chef, and I know swordfish has a VERY narrow window in which it tastes best.  The chef NAILED it!  I mean, PERFECT!  Accompanied with a black rice side, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, and my wife loved her pork Milanese.  Go, have something with mushrooms, something foraged, and enjoy this little hidden gem.",

    "text": "The fella and I have now tried Heirloom for dinner and Sunday brunch. I want to like it more than I do since I appreciate what they're going for, but I think it's the atmosphere (and value) that throw me. I feel like they're trying to be fine dining, but the roof is rusted, the inside is really dark with outdated, heavy wood paneling, and it's so uncomfortably quiet that I find myself whispering the entire time.  That said, the food is really good... but the brunch selection was way too limited. Today, we had the option of the catch of the day (but who wants fish at 10:00 a.m.?), deconstructed eggs benedict, and eggs your way with toast and tesa, which is the fancy word for Italian bacon, and I had to Google it to find out what I was about to order. Only three entree options for brunch and one is fish? Yikes.  I got the bacon and eggs ($13) and a small French press coffee ($4.50), and the fella went with the eggs benedict, which were beautiful, but he was still hungry when we left, and they cost $16. Mine was fine, but it's pretty difficult to mess up boring ol' bacon and eggs even though the eggs could've used some salt.  All that said, we did enjoy dinner the one time we went and appreciated being able to try a few different courses. Today's 3-course brunch meal ($30) was a starter salad, the catch of the day, and a dessert. Again I ask who wants a salad and fish at 10:00 a.m.?   I don't mean to judge so harshly, but when you're going to charge a hefty price, I want to feel like I got my money's worth and truly enjoyed the experience. I enjoyed their dinner more than their brunch, but \"fancier\" restaurants like Lumiere, Passion8, and Heritage have food that's just as delicious, but with a much less pretentious atmosphere and more value for what you get.",

My wife really enjoyed her Braised Pork Shoulder.   The wine they suggested was great and the service was perfect.    If you are going to go I would recommend business casual dress at least. It is a fine dining establishment definitely.   The only reason I'm docking a star and its not a 5 star is that they need to do something about the mens restroom. It smelled and was a turnoff.

    "text": "I had read about this little gem, but still didn't quite know what to expect....is there REALLY a fine dining establishment in Coulwood? The answer is YES!  The decor is eclectic farm shabby chic (our table had a tree stump as it's base). The menu is described as hyper local and changes day to day. It is on par with any high end restaurant downtown or in the South Park area.  Please frequent this establishment we need to see it survive!! I made a reservation and noted that I required gluten free meals. Chef Barlowe called me less than an hour later ensured me that would be no problem, they can adjust the menu easily and asked if I might want dessert? If so, he would have his pastry chef create 2 choices for me. Now, that's customer service! Upon arrival we were greeted with fresh beet and sweet potato chips rather than bread due to my allergy. My husband and I both opted for \"the egg\" appetizer. It was fresh mixed greens with a poached egg,  pieces of rendered lamb belly, and a champagne vinaigrette. In my mind, I thought I knew what this would taste like....I was wrong, the taste was quite different than what I had envisioned and SO much tastier. I hope this is a signature dish, because I could enjoy that again and again. For dinner I chose the tile fish which was served in a gluten free manner for me with sauteed bok choy and the most amazing purple sweet potatoes that I have ever tasted. I would go there again just for a plate of those sweet potatoes! My husband opted for the rabbit served with peas, sprouts, and roasted carrots. The rabbit was SO good...cooked perfectly and not nearly as gamey as I thought it might taste.  Next time I dine there, I will have my own plate of rabbit, because one bite of my husband's was not enough! Portions were ample and plated eloquently with descriptions of the dish given at the time of arrival. Dessert was divine, a lemon vanilla cake with honeydew honey and champagne sauces and ice cream (if I remember correctly). By far the best gluten free dessert I have ever had, and maybe even the best non-GF as well.  Service was great. Courses were spaced appropriately and you did not feel rushed. The staff was very knowledgeable and ready to offer recommendations. Chef Barlowe and the Chef Perlmutter (Pastry Chef) both stopped by the table to ensure that everything was acceptable and said to never hesitate to let them know when we were dining with them, it was no trouble to adapt the menu and Chef Perlmutter even welcomed the challenge to experiment with new gluten free items. We will definitely dine here again. I am still blown away at this True \"neighborhood gem.\"",

I was excited that the chef had worked at the French Laundry in Napa and expected a real treat.  Instead, the food was not special at all.  They try gimmicky presentation and the menu confused more than it helped.  The waiter seemed overwhelmed.  We had to ask for more bread and drinks after he whisked by us several times.  He acted like he wanted to be attentive, but was anything but.  The duck was like chewing on grizzle and the other entree of brisket was more like stew beef than the fancy description on the menu.  I hope they can make it though.  I just wanted to give more balance to the sterling reviews.",

    "text": "Horrible dinner here last Friday night.   Front of House and Kitchen totally imploded.   After being seated for a 45 minutes, we had to get up and go find our waitress to order.   Were finally brought bread at the hour mark, but portion was so small, one friend called it the communion course.   Ironically the hostess did fresh herbs and olive oil table side in an 8 inch bowl, which made the bread seem smaller.  We thought perhaps more bread would be brought to be commensurate with the oil, but alas no.   First Course was an heirloom salad, this was done well  but should have been cold.   Opt. 2 was chicken and dumplings.  There was no dumplings to be found, tasted more like chicken pot pie without crust and was bland!   2nd Course - Pork Belly was probably the best thing all night.   3rd Course - overcooked fish and chewy steak.  4th Course was other highlight. Dessert nice blueberry shortcake.     7:30 reservation - didn't finish til 11:00.   The waitstaff refused to come over, wasn't coordinated, and couldn't get a refill to save our lives.   The kitchen couldn't keep up with a full house.  It seemed like they were cooking one table at a time.   Yes - restaurant week amps up exposure and business, but if the restaurant can't handle it - it drives customers away.   Slow service, small portions, okay food.     Train your waitstaff and trade the 3 of them hiding at the bar all night for a solid sous chef.",

    "text": "Went to Heirloom tonight for Restaurant Week and oh my god the food. Ever seen When Harry Met Sally? I almost had a Meg Ryan moment for real at the table. I started off with the tomato salad which was fresh and delicious and my boyfriend had the best chicken and dumplings I've ever tasted. Next course was pork belly with sauce that I literally had to stop myself from licking off the plate. We asked for bread and were both scrubbing our plates with it. Then came entrees. I had the filet which was cooked to a perfect medium with mashed potatoes that I could eat probably every day. And more sauce, and our waitress brought me lots more sauce. He had the daily catch, which when we got there was red drum and the flavors on the plate blended beautifully. And then the chocolate cremuex cake. Oh the chocolate cake. I told the waitress it was like angels descended down and gave us that cake, I literally held the last bite in my mouth for at least 30 seconds to finish savoring the flavor (see the Meg Ryan comment above). Now, the reason for the lack of star. When we were first seated we were seated in a back room that was COLD. I am NOT one to ask to be moved, but it was so cold I knew I wouldn't be able to enjoy my meal. We were moved to the main room and waited around for at least 5 minutes before someone even acknowledged us. The hostess ended up picking up our table and mentioned to us that they only had 2 servers on this evening. She was AMAZING (seriously, promote her to waitress, she deserves it) but my boyfriend and I both felt that only 2 servers for restaurant week was seriously understaffing (we both have service industry backgrounds). The server I'm assuming we were supposed to have was running around like a chicken with his head cut off, no seriously, he was running. I feel like you should never show the customers how flustered you are, that's what the kitchen is for. Thank God for the hostess and the male server's assistant. They were both on top of their game for sure. I was also a little off put by the fact that when our bill came the bottle of wine we ordered showed up as $54 and on the menu it was listed as $43. I love the fact that they only use NC libations but not so thrilled that I am willing to pay an extra $11 for something. They did fix it with no issues, so I was grateful for that. All in all, we will be back. Hopefully by then the hostess is promoted to waitress and we can get in her section because she saved the experience of the night, the food was already phenomenal, but when you go out it's about the experience too.",

    "text": "I admittedly rarely write reviews (good or bad), but my experience at Heirloom was so disappointing that I felt the need to write this one.    I had always heard good things about Heirloom and the reviews on here would certainly support that.  A group of 4 of us made the 30-minute trip from South Charlotte with high hopes.  We had reservations at 7:30 on a Saturday night, but judging by the restaurant being only about a third full, I'm guessing they weren't necessary.    All 4 of us opted for the tasting menu.  None of us had any dietary restrictions or any special requests and let our server know we were in the chef's hands.  All 4 of us dine out a good bit and have experienced quite a few tasting menus in Charlotte as well as other cities.  Our first dish was a cucumber salad which was good, but unspectacular.  That was followed up by conch soup.  The soup was really disappointing.  It had very little flavor and the broth tasted like something I would expect to have come out of a can.  At this point, with two courses down, I started to get a little concerned.  The third dish had asparagus with a meat sauce.  This dish was just so-so - the kind of dish you eat but don't really care if you never have it again.  The 4th dish, the main course, was veal.  The veal was cooked well, but the portion was tiny, especially considering how little food was in the first 4 dishes.  This was followed by a cheese dish, which was good, but I'm generally not going to a restaurant like this for the cheese dish.  Finally, there was a deconstructed cheesecake for dessert which was decent, but definitely forgettable.    As we wrapped things up, we all kind of looked at each other in disappointment and all agreed that this was the worst tasting menu any of us had experienced.  Two of us took turns apologizing to the others that \"the reviews were great\" and \"maybe we caught them on a bad night,\" but judging by how empty the place was, perhaps that's not the case.  I would also point out that the service was very poor.  Our server made no attempt to ask me or my wife if we wanted another drink  (considering the cocktails are around $15, you would think she would have been all over this) and our tiny water glasses were only sporadically refilled.  Also, when it was time to pay, the server comes out with an I-Pad to take credit cards.  We had two couples at our table and each couple paid separately.  Our server verbally announced the total for each couple prior to handing over the I-Pad.  We are close with the other couple, so it wasn't a big deal, but I found this to be poor etiquette by our server.     For two tasting menus, 3 cocktails and a beer, our total before tip was a little over $200.  I'd like to think we just picked the wrong night to come, but none of us are ever going to take the time to find out.",

    "text": "We came here for a friend's birthday during restaurant week and had a fantastic experience. Heirloom is great for food, but they do a lot of little things that also make it stand out.  First the food because, ultimately that matters the most. I ventured out on my own and ordered off the standard menu. I started with the Chicken Chips. I'm assuming they are fried bits of chicken skin (I didn't ultimately ask) but they are delicious and really well seasoned! Get an order for the table. Everyone I shared them with loved them and the dipping sauces they came with. I settled on the Pork Belly for my meal. It was really good, but in farm to table, the meat isn't where you notice the difference. But the carrots and grits that came with it? Holy heck those were phenomenal. If I had to do it again, I'd just skip the meat and load up on their veggies. And I'm 90% carnivore.  Now about those little touches...for my friend's birthday they personalized a menu for her with her name at the top (she made the reservation). Probably took them all of 10 seconds to type in the header and print it out. But again, it's those small things that make them stand out just a little bit more. In addition to her desert, they brought us all out a small scoop of their homemade ice cream. It was so smooth and creamy and a nice unexpected treat. After dinner, they gave my friend a new copy of her menu but this one had been signed by the head chef with a little birthday note. Given it was restaurant week and the place was moderately busy, it was a super nice gesture.  It's a little bit out of the way, though totally worth the drive. I don't know when I'll be able to make it back. But I do have my own birthday coming up...in six months.",

    "text": "Wow. Make reservations now and treat yourself to a night of great food, conversation, and the art of dining.  For my birthday, my friends and family took me to Heirloom. We got personalized menus with my name on it and the chef even signed mine!   My husband and I shared the 12-courses. Even though the rest of our party did not do the full 12, they were served \"place holders\" to not be without or just stare at us while we ate. Each time a course arrived, the server would describe the dish and it was artistically plated. I felt like I was on an episode of the Chef's Table.   It was a perfect way to spend an evening. Three hours of eating, sharing, and being with my friends and family in an establishment that cares about locally sourced, seasonal dishes. They even have a bee farm on the roof!",

All of the dishes were mediocre at best. My duck was over cooked to the point of being woody. My son's ravioli was almost raw and looked unappetizing. Even the mac and cheese was downright disgusting. We paid a fine dining price and got a 2-star meal. They were slow (understandably) but the service was still bad. At one point the floor manager had to step in because our waiter was way off schedule. There are way better options for far less money, even in this neighborhood.",

    "text": "Impressed, and will definitely be back. As mentioned in other reviews, the drive is lengthy, but so worth it for many reasons. The service was impeccable. From recommendations around drinks, to sharing information about the restaurant's concept, I've rarely had such friendly service. I challenged their mixologist to create something similar to a Pimm's cup, and by golly was he able to do so. The mister also loovved his Forager cocktail. I also really appreciate the commitment to only using North Carolina ingredients. There are a lot of farm-to-table restaurants (lived in Nashville for a spell, and that is a hot bed for that concept), but very few that succeed in sourcing ALL ingredients locally. Bravo!  Now, on to the food. This was a restaurant week pick for me and the mister. And, Heirloom mostly delivered. The plating was wonderfully done, and I appreciated the granita as a palate cleanser before dessert. I had the salad, steak, and chocolate ravioli, while the mister had the hand pie, catch of the day, and angel food cake. So, why the four stars? The first and second courses were certainly the highlights for our meal, but neither of the desserts quite worked for us. The ravioli texture was off for me, and the cake was a bit too sugary. I also have to just put it out there that the restaurant decor is lacking. It's such a solid restaurant, but the rustic look is just not working for it. It reminded us both of the early 90s hunter's lodge style.",

    "text": "Quick sum-up: a fancy restaurant with an earthy feel to it. Not the best / memorable for the price, but definitely had some good dishes. Come here early because your meal will last hours.   Really on the outskirts of Charlotte (or in the middle of nowhere..?), this restaurant definitely tries to go off the conventional route. They have a 12 course menu, locally sourced (from wine to food). You can select a 12, 9, 7, 5, or 3 course meal. You can also share your courses, so two people can have one 12 course meal and a 3 course meal (sort of as an add-on). They also have vegetarian options for some of the courses, but you usually won't be able to get it substituted for the main entrees that is a meat.  I appreciate the locally sourced food, but coming here after eating at Kindred, this place just couldn't compare. Especially since it was nearly 3xs the price.   The starters, mostly a salad, was not impressive. Good, but had no \"wow\" factor. My favorite dish was the cobia, a shark-like fish. It was perfect--not too greasy, firm, or salty. The homemade pasta and stuffed crab was also up there, though the crab was slightly salty.   I'd say because the other courses were mediocre and given the price you pay, this place is a 3-star.",

    "text": "Don't go during restaurant week.    We'd been saving this place for a special day as it's pretty pricey.  When we finally went (not realizing it was restaurant week) they had a limited menu and our waiter was pretty up front about the fact that they normally do better.    My fiance ordered a mozzarella salad appetizer that contained exactly two pieces of mozzarella.  Our cocktails didn't live up to the reputation either.  Both were almost straight liquor and my fiance's tasted like Vick's.    Our entrees were very bad.  Neither of us got more than halfway through.  My fiance's fried chicken had minimal chicken meat and my eggplant lasagna didn't seem done.  The eggplant was tough and not very flavorful.    We ordered dessert (because it's a package deal with restaurant week) but took it to go because we were so underwhelmed with the whole experience.  We haven't tasted it yet.    The point of restaurant week is to encourage people to try new places and find new favorites.  I don't think Heirloom will be winning any new customers this week, which is a real shame because the farm-to-fork idea is so cool.",

Upon sitting I explained I was vegan and asked if that could be accommodated, and our waiter said yes. The chef came to the table and acted as if it were an inconvenience that he had to prepare a special dish. The only option I was given was pasta and marinara, which I agreed upon. We waited one hour for our food (there was only 2 of us). The dish that was presented to me was not what I had ordered. It was a pasta with mushrooms and a brown sauce, and I had specifically stated no mushrooms. When I explained this dish was not what was discussed, the server took it away and I waited 15 minutes more to be brought what looked and smelled like canned spaghetti. It was visually unappealing. So much so, I declined it. I watched my husband eat and not once did a manager come to the table to discuss. We were charged for every item, minus the pasta. In all, we were at Heirloom for 1.5 hours. I am so let down. As a vegan, I have eaten at many high class restaurants, and at the good ones, a vegan dish is not too much to ask for and can be prepared without a challenge.  We will not be back.",

    "text": "Firstly, the concept and ambiance are definitely 5 stars, but that's not what I am reviewing for. While it is nice to have an attentive hostess and very homey decor, I cannot say that will bring me back.  As a disclaimer, I love healthy, farm to table food and my review is based on my opinion. I ordered a bacon sweet potato soup, which in theory sounded as if it would be great for sweet savory and creamy. It was totally scalding hot and tasted as if it was completely burned. I couldn't get past that flavor to even be able to assess the dish's intended flavor.  I also tried the mill house pasta dish, but couldn't get past the lack of flavor over compensated for by a massive amount of yellow onions. The sauce was thick and light so you couldn't tell where they were so I wasn't able to remove any of them on my own. I would notice when I was eating there would be a crunchiness to the noodles, which was very unsettling. The flavor was also bland, even with the onions. The crab cakes were actually very good and I think a great texture, I would recommend those if you want to pay $14/cake.  The final piece that helped me rate my experience was our servers lack of genuine care. It seemed as if she was trying too hard to be excited about us which didn't match with how she treated us. For instance, asking what exactly is the \"apple cake?\" Her reply was (in a high pitched attempting to be nice voice) \"It's an apple cake.\" I swear I was on Dumb and Dumber when he asks \"what the soup d'jour\" is and she says \"it's the soup of the day.\" Call me crazy to not be versed in cakes that are made from fruit, as I'm not a huge pastry person. Plus, I've never had their dessert, so I don't see how it was far fetched to inquire about the possibility that that dish could have been closer to a pie vs an actual cake. She also never came around even though she only seemed to have 3 tables and the restaurant was mostly empty. Again, not rating this review on the service, but on the actual food and my experience. I don't believe I will be trying this restaurant again, as there are much better farm to table options around Charlotte and NC in general.",

To begin my husband had the Bermuda fish chowder and I had the lightening cakes. My husband refused to eat the soup after one bite. He hated it. The mushroom cakes had a weird aftertaste that disliked so I swapped him appetizers. We would never order either again.  For our entree I had shrimp and grits and he had fried chicken with mac and cheese. The shrimp and grits was lackluster and bland. The fried chicken was juicy and perfectly cooked but again it was bland. It came with two dipping sauces. The bbq sauce was just hot without a lot of flavor and the buttermilk sauce was flat. The saving grace of the meal was the fantastic Mac and cheese. It was truly excellent.  Dessert was the Black Forest cake and the persimmon pie. Both were just okay. The persimmon pie was our favorite even though we couldn't detect any persimmon or pie for that matter. But the Carmel sauce was excellent. The Black Forest cake was dry and once again, lacking rich flavor.  Overall it was not what we were expecting and I doubt we will be back anytime soon. *I must note that the service was excellent!",

Not everything will be to your liking or may be a little too frou frou for the average diner. They will try to direct you to the 12 courses as a couple suggesting you share it, but frankly all the courses didn't appeal nor could I imagine eating so much food. Portions are small -- more like tapas -- except for the entree ones that are a little larger than the salads & deserts, but I was happy with 3 for me. And at most, 5 would probably do it even for a big eater.  The night we went, I had first a carrot & Bibb lettuce salad; second steamed clams; and lastly an amberjack course. My husband had the heirloom tomato; then the pork course; then a peach desert. I'm simplifying for space's sake... Each item came with many various garnishes and side items.   Service was good.. A dining experience so a bit slower. I was glad we went. But I'm not sure I'd come there again.",

On our table tonight was a salad of watermelon radish and asparagus, a buttermilk biscuit with black pepper butter, pumpkin soup, fresh sheepshead fish on a bed of risotto to die for, roasted goose on fresh mashed potatoes, a blonde brownie desert adorned with fresh cream and chocolate, finished with a cheese course. Portions are ample.   Heirloom's atmosphere is eclectic and delightfully quiet. The people here are living the farm to fork experience. Jars of hand made vinegars and preserves line the walls.

    "text": "Full disclosure, I was a little wary because I thought Heirloom might be too high brow for me.  I see the pictures of the food on Twitter and Instagram and thought maybe this was a place only a Top Chef judge would love.    I was very happy to be both right and wrong at the same time.  Short version, we had an incredible experience from the moment we walked in the door.  Beautiful, rustic decor on the inside, but in no way kitschy.  The service was excellent.  Our waiter knew the menu back to front, and same for the wine selection.  The menu changes daily and everything is hyper-local.  The server who brought our wine over gave us a great rundown of the local NC wineries.  We did the 12 course tasting menu because why not?  If you are going to a place like this, just get the full experience.  Back to my concern above about high brow food, I thought each dish might just be a few bites and we'd leave hungry.  We actually left the restaurant completely indulged.  Although I wouldn't have wanted to give up any of the dishes we got, we probably could have done the 7 or 9 course menu and been completely satisfied.  I won't give the complete rundown of every dish, but a couple of the highlights for us were the egg yolk pasta with braised duck and garlic cream sauce, NC grouper, duck confit, and an unreal rice pudding with a blueberry jam.    I have no problems paying up for what I feel is well-crafted food that you can't get anywhere else, along with being waited on and treated like I'm spending a lot of money.  That's EXACTLY what I got at Heirloom.  We paid a recent visit to the new restaurant Kindred in Davidson and had a good experience.  Nothing out of this world, but good.  Heirloom knocked my socks off.  The quality of the effort being made here is on par with some of the nicer restaurants we went to in Sonoma/Napa/SF on a recent trip.    I can't wait to go back.",

The price tag for food that should explode with flavor given the tasting size portions made me realize that my money would have been better spent on anything else.  The other reviews that give this place high marks may have been a result of excited folks influenced by its postings as best new restaurant, or that they want to seem supportive of a growing restaurant trend in Charlotte.  I do not see how high marks are deserved.  Finally,  Heirloom is not kid friendly in any way.  If you are going, leave your kids behind and experience the lackluster that is Heirloom without them.

We started off with special cocktails including one named \"Surprise Me.\" The server asks what cocktails you typically like then the bartender makes something up on the fly. My group of three then ordered one twelve course meal and one four course meal. We shared everything and the quantity was filing enough for us all. Our twelve course meal consisted of two appetizers, two salads, eggplant bisque, pasta, grouper, beef, a divine fried rabbit, cheeses and two desserts. The protein dishes were complemented by perfectly cooked vegetables.   The menu changes daily so what we had will likely not be what would be served to you. Chef Clark Barlowe goes to farms and markets daily to buy what's available then creates the menu that day. He also forages for edibles that he uses in his food. That must be an excitingly creative way to work and it certainly shows in what he serves.  The service was first class. The restaurant is in what seems to be a former steak house or pancake restaurant and the way the tables are arranged makes it feel a bit sparse. To remedy this I think they purposefully keep it dark with little ambient lighting and candles on the table. We found it difficult to read the menu (even the twenty-somethings with me) and we had to ask for some additional candles. Another problem the night we were there was apparently because of two large groups of guests. There was about a thirty minute delay between the fish course and the beef course. That threw off our \"pace\" and we found ourselves just wanting to go home. BUT I will in no way let that negatively influence my opinion of Heirloom - I'm hoping that was just a temporary glitch that night.  Make a reservation as soon as you can!",

    "text": "Very seldom do I dole out 5 stars, but Heirloom is extremely worthy. Every detail is examined to perfection. The atmosphere is earthy, chic, local, warm and inviting. Graffiti in the bathroom is encouraged for Goodness sakes!  The head chef and owner is Clark Barlowe, the offspring of a local farmer. His family has run their farm for seven generations! The inspiration and hype of the restaurant is centered around farm to table, locally and ethically sourced foods, including having their own herb gardens and foraging. Everything is local from the honey to oils, meats, fish, vegetables, mushrooms.   Also what makes the establishment unique and creative are the concoctions and techniques in which to deliver the food, such as the liquid nitrogen ice cream, salting and curing, canning, etc.  My waiter was AWESOME! He was knowledgeable, friendly and engaging. It's safe to say that everyone on staff is a high caliber of TO COOL FOR SCHOOL!   The menu changes daily and is setup as a tasting menu. With that being said you can eat as little or as much as you prefer from a la carte up to a 12 course meal. I was shooting for 7 courses and after finishing my fourth, I amended it to five. I had a salad, soup, fish (which is saying a lot because I'm an ovo-lacto vegetarian not a pescatarian, but I was doing a lot of heavy exercise and was craving some.. Since I know it was locally and ethically caught, my conscience was okay. I haven't eaten fish in over a year and my body consumed it fine, no odd side effects). The most fun and interesting dish was #4, a dish that I, the chef and my waiter created on the spot. It had woodier mushrooms, purple sweet potato puree, watermelon radishes, tiny radishes, fennel, broccoli, ...... Yummy! Last but not least I had dessert, preserve strawberries, vanilla anglaise nitrogen ice cream custard balls, crunchy shortcake.  The entire meal my tastebuds were tantalized and seduced.. I experienced new flavors, new-to-me foods, and it was all arranged so eclectically, just for me! Amazing.  I should point out the farms where the food originates. :::: Atlantic Caviar & Sturgeon, ASU Biodynamic Farm, Belle's Best, Bosky Acres, Burton Farm, Charlotte Fish Company, Coldwater Creek Farm, East Carolina Organics, Harmony Ridge Farms, Heart & Sole, Jarrett Bay Oysters, Lineberger Farm, Lucky Clays Farm, New Appalachia, Pure Intentions Coffee, Rowland's Row, Salem Hills Farm, and Tevepaugh Orchard.   Aside from the food, the staff and ambience. The restrooms are so cool, they really are a complete opposite of the dining room decor of the old barn and nature infused .. Think tree trunk table bases. The restroom has graffiti all over the doors and walls.. You are encouraged to sign your, \"I was here momento,\" with Sharpies placed throughout. I loved the Whispering Willow hand soap and can't wait to buy their products as well.  Heirloom prepares and serves dinner Tuesday through Saturday from 5-9 PM and cocktails on Fridays and Saturdays from 9-10 PM. Pricing reflects quality, creativity and ingenuity. With that being said, I was lucky enough to score a Groupon which cut my total cost by at least 40%.   Will I return as a treat in the future? Absol-fricken-lutely!!!!!",

    "text": "(Shortened; full review on Heirloom's FB)  I'm only giving this place 4 stars because I know it's striving for absolute perfection, so the loss of a star is just to indicate room for improvement. For all other intents and purposes, this place is definitely a 5-star kind of joint and you should DEFINITELY visit.  Why it's NOT perfect: - Some of the dishes were tooo oily. The salad had way more oil than vinegar in the vinaigrette. - The broccoli gnocchi suffered from the over-oiled problem, too. And it was just not a very well-conceived dish in general. The texture of the gnocchi was exquisite and the trout-chovy and local cheese was appreciated, but it's all hidden beneath the oppressive flavor of the broccoli.  - I love bread and herbed oil to start off a meal, but a bread basket would be better (instead of a meager single slice), especially if it was an endless one for those who can only afford to indulge in 3 or 5 courses. - In the broccoli soup, the garnish of popcorn and chervil were cute and looked great, but didn't really add anything besides aesthetics to the dish. Wasn't sure how I was supposed to eat it. - The space seems a little too wide open. Makes for kind of stark feeling instead of the warm coziness their decor seems to be going for.  Why it's EXCEEDINGLY AWESOME: + Pretty much every ingredient is locally sourced, whether it be from a local farm, foraged, or from a small business. We're even talking about the salt and pepper, guys.  Insanely ambitiously awesome.  + Cool, unusual ingredients. Chicken of the woods mushrooms. Chocolate mint. Blue corn. And not only that, but... + Creative, thoughtful use of ingredients. Perfectly cooked and crunchy beet matchsticks in the salad with a somewhat bitter foraged black walnut matched with a pungent cheese. It just works! + Perfectly cooked ingredients. The soft boiled egg. The gooeyness of the gnocchi. The seared monkfish. The duck falling off the bone. The crunch of the brussels sprouts leaves. The crisp on the rice waffle. Per-fec-tion. + Presentation. Every dish looks like a million bucks. + The portion size. Not too much, not too little, when you're considering the meal as a whole. For an exciting culinary adventure, get 5+ courses, 7+ if you want to feel full. + Dishes: 1) Caviar w/ rice flour waffle, watercress creme fraiche. Fun, beautifully presented, each component tastes delicious and it's absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS all together. 2) Duck Confit w/ blue corn grits, brussels sprouts leaves. We took pictures of all our dishes and we didn't get a picture of this one because it was GONE before we could snap it. Something about the roastiness of the duck going into the creamy grits and the crunch of the brussels sprouts leaves was just so gobble-worthy. 3) Monkfish w/ espelette broth, shaved fennel, pea shoots, gremolata sauce. WOW. I don't even know how all these ingredients came together to be so damn delicious, but it did. What a balance. The flavor of the crunchy fennel wasn't too powerful, the char on the fish gave it so much flavor, the broth had an acid kick to it and all together it just WORKED. All at the right temperature, at the right texture, outstanding. + Dessert was also complex: the fruit salad (strawberry, citrus, chocolate mint) was the highlight to the rooftop honey rye cake we got. + Can't forget the BEES! What's more local than taking the honey from your rooftop and drizzling it on your dessert?! + Service was super knowledgeable, friendly, generally well-paced, out of your face. Although with the nature of the size and number of the dishes, you will see a lot of your servers, and they have things to say about the dish, so your flow of conversation might be interrupted.  About the cost: I hate paying a lot for food. Indeed, my 5-star reviews are reserved for restaurants that make excellent food I can't duplicate at home AND are a steal to eat at. So Heirloom's got the former requirement, for sure. Also, I feel better about paying $$$ when the restaurant is socially conscious. Heirloom's got bees on its roof, it goes local to an almost absurd extent. Check there. I also don't mind patronizing the arts. There is definitely artistry to these dishes. So point there. I mean, think about it--Chef Barlowe makes dishes out of NC-sourced ingredients and the menu is different every day. The kitchen's at the mercy of what's available, and since your menu's changing every day, you've got to train your line cooks to cook the new dishes AND teach your servers how to present it. Every. Day. That's a lot of work. I've been to a few restaurants at this price point that hardly does what Heirloom does daily. So in a way, it's kind of steal to get this kind of quality and effort at this price. Sure, it cuts off a lot of people in the community from dining here, but it's also doing the community a service to a certain extent. So it's a price I'm willing to pay, and even though I can only afford it for special occasions, I'll definitely be back.",

Ok that sounds like a negative review of environment but to me it is a compliment. The place has an eclectic style that reminds me of my youth, yet it works to convey a modern spin on grandmas. I just wish my grandma could have cooked this well. Dont get me wrong Lois was no slouch in the kitchen and her type of foraging was finding the goat meat at the bottom of the freezer and making something delightful. The fresh foraged fare at heirloom shines against the rustic wood walls. I had the tasting menu, what a way to experience this place.  Here is what I had:  Chicken skins - 2 stars Rabbit fried rice - 5 stars Steak - 5 stars Duck confit - 5 stars Rutabaga soup - 4 stars  My only dissappointing menu item was the chicken skins. I had the redneck nachos at soul gastrolounge about a month before and I had high expectations, it wasn't terrible just not nearly as good.Everything else was a gastronomic adventure. Please don't miss out on this opportunity  the food was outstanding, Inspired cousine that would make any grandma green with envy.",

They locally source all the items from NC farms and the menu changes every day depending on whats in season.  I was visiting from DC and really wanted to come and check it out. I went here for a weeknight dinner with the family and from the moment we walked in, the experience was great.  We were greeted and seated by Chase. He was very professional and friendly and gave us the background of the restaurant and how the menu worked.   They have a twelve course tasting menu but you can choose any combination of 3,5,7, or 12.  To start off they gave us hot biscuits and chopped fresh herbs right at the table to add to the olive oil.  The biscuits were very light, moist and delicious.    We were happy with every course and could definitely taste the quality of the food and ingredients used. For the tasting courses we got: - fresh oysters (light and briny), turnip salad (well dressed and fresh ingredients), white potato soup (smooth and creamy with a hint of cheesy flavor), Catfish and grits (nice flaky fish), Duck breast (perfectly cooked and flavorful), NC crab w/ brussels sprouts (great tasty mix), Lemon Blueberry parfait (so light and fluffy with the perfect mix of tart and sweet).   I would absolutely come back for the great food and service.  Everyone was attentive and very friendly.  I would also be looking forward to see what is on the menu next time.  The chef really knows his ingredients and how to create great tasting dishes.",

Server was knowledgeable about sourcing and ingredients, but not about portions or progression. Fried chicken did not have crunchy skin and the chicken was rubbery. We skipped dessert, not wanting to be further disappointed. The website claims the chef's connections to The French Laundry and El Bulli, but this food would never make the cut in those restaurants.

    "text": "My fiance and I recently returned to Heirloom and our experience could not have been more different than our first outing. This time we shared the 12 course tasting menu as all the courses were appealing to at least one of us.   Not one of the courses disappointed. Particularly delicious were the first course, a salad with wonderfully fresh greens and flavorful but not overwhelming dressing. The sixth course which was listed on the menu as red drum but they ran out so they replaced it with monkfish. I was first disappointed as I love red drum but the monkfish was perfectly cooked and seasoned. This was followed by a chorizo pasta. The pasta was homemade egg noodles and amazing! The monkfish and the pasta made me wish you could order a full size plate of some items.   I give heirloom 4 stars following this visit, rather than 5 because the daily change in menu is incredibly hard to maintain. There is no guarantee that the menu options will be to your tasting on the night you dine. As this really is a destination restaurant for most, it is hard to plan ahead to make reservations in the event that the menu on the day of your reservation will be to your liking.   That being said, the service was outstanding. The cocktails are the most creative I have ever had. And the overall experience was a five star experience.",

    "text": "I am so glad I had the opportunity to check out Heirloom.  If I was going to be totally honest I would probably give a 3.8 out of 5.  There were some great things about our experience and there were a couple things that were not so great.  Let me recap:  The location is about as random as it gets.  Off the beaten path, heading towards Gastonia.   Not much in the area to look at and I wouldn't say that it is in the \"safest\" part of town.  Nonetheless, the restaurant itself looked nice from the outside and stood apart from the surrounding environment.  When we stepped in, it was very quiet on a Thursday evening.  No music, no hustle or bustle.  It was bright and I remember thinking it was a bit cold...in terms of temperature.  We were immediately greeted by a handsome young lad.  I don't know if he was a manager, host, owner or whatever but he was very friendly and pretty much let us pick where we wanted to sit.  The restaurant was basically wide open.  I appreciated the rustic, granola, organic feel of the place.  The decor wasn't necessarily inviting but it was unique and fitting for the theme of the restaurant:  farm to table.  It had a quaker feel to it.  As I previously mentioned...the lighting was a little TOO bright and the temperature was almost to the point of being uncomfortably cold.    The menu changes daily so they print it on cardstock every day with only local ingredients sourced and used.  My boss was treating my husband and I to a nice dinner and when she made the reservation she mentioned it was my 5 year anniversary with the company.  They were supposed to print something on the menus to reflect the celebration but they forgot.  They also mentioned that they were low on cardstock so we had to wait for others in the restaurant to finish with the menus so we could have our own.  A little bootleg but forgivable.    The four of us decided to do the full 12 course meal (1 per couple) as suggested by the very friendly waiter.  There were some items that were definitely out of my comfort zone but they were so creative and outside of the box that I truly enjoyed the spin on everything we tried.  I can't run through everything but it was basically everything from clams, kale salad, custard, a variety of cheese, butternut squash soup, curried rabbit, duck carbonara, oysters, beef liver mousse, grilled snapper, etc.  The deconstructed pumpkin pie, hot chocolate, and truffles completed the meal.  Truly everything was done very well and had something special or nonconventional to tantalize any palette!  My personal favorite was the snapper and the curried rabbit.  Very tasty.  Some of the cheese choices were either too bland or too strong so no love there and I found the duck carbonara to be a little bland but that is just me.  The courses were served with just enough time spaced inbetween so we really didn't leave feeling stuffed.  It was the perfect \"taste\" of everything.  They allow you to bring your own bottle of wine but they also offer all NC wines, spirits, cocktails, etc.    Overall we were pleased with the presentation of the food, the brave choice of flavor combinations, the freshness of the ingredients, etc.  A great experience.  Not the type of place you will frequent but they certainly hold their own.  They also offer different types of cooking classes and other specials throughout the month.  Check them out!",

They have a solid menu of cocktails and wine... you'll be able to find something you like or the bartender can create something unique based on your tastes.  You can order a 12, 9, 7, 5, or three course menu... or you can order a la carte, most people will be good with a 5-7 course menu as the portions tend to be small tapas style. Ordering the 12 course basically means you are ordering the entire menu for the day with is pretty cool. You can also order a la carte but the value in the meal is not typically there. We went with the 12 course menu and I have to say it didn't disappoint, though some dishes were very uninspiring (gnocchi, beef tongue), the majority of them had good flavors and execution (tomato salad, shrimp, duck). The two desserts and cheese plate were good.  The service was very good, the staff was extremely friendly and we felt welcomed from the start. Our server was knowledgeable and if he didn't know the answer he went and got it, which is something I appreciated.   I'm rounding up to five starts because when you look at all the other Charlotte restaurants, this one belongs in the top echelon of culinary adventures. Go for a special occasion or for a business meal, you won't be disappointed.",

The waiter was unsure about what do as we came with our Groupon.    The manager came over and was very standoffish. He explained the fine print \"clearly states\" they did not accept groupons during Restaurant Week. Sure,  ok. Did not need to belittle us and be pompous but apparently that is this places style.   Also, where I'm from Restaurant Week is an attempt to make Restaurants more accessible not less. Their tasting menu was 3 courses. The first was a $6-$7 appetizer, the second was a $15-$17 entree. The third coarse was a choice between 2 desserts. That makes those desserts worth around $14 since this menu cost $35.   So Heirloom is in sum rude, pompous, greedy and its kind of out of they way of everything else. This is an easy pass folks.",

    "text": "Impeccable Service and Great Food is worth five stars. The food is fresh and delivered by a knowledgeable staff. I love the concept of locally sourced food,  but my husband is a meat and potatoes guy- in retrospect we would not order the 12 course option because the mixture of foods did not sit well with him. If you are like my hubby then forgo the 12 course option and order the cucumber salad, swordfish and dessert. Hubby's only complaint was that the cheese and crackers was served with dessert and he would of liked to have that on the table earlier so he could nosh on it; also he would like a TV in the bar.   The restaurant is large, and has a minimalist appeal; therefore we heard the conversation of the tables next to us, as I am sure they heard ours. The TV would be a nice buffer as would plants or something to make it more comfortable for a party of two.   My advice is order one of their uniquely crafted drinks and look over the menu carefully before you decide on how many courses to choose; each course was delicious and the staff is knowledgable about food- but lacks the insight older/seasoned waitstaff. For example a meat and potatoes guy may not appreciate the oysters or duck and he may worry that there will not be enough food to share.  Reassurance from the waitress is much better than wondering what is next- in other words \"read the menu\".  That being said both hubby and I agree that this was the most attentive wait staff we have ever encountered! We just put down our fork , and they remove all evidence from the table, and set you up for the next course, refill water, and answer questions. Five stars for excellent food and excellent service!!",

    "text": "Let me just preface this by saying: I just may be the world's pickiest eater. When my wedding caterer asked what I liked and didn't like, my (only moderately joking) response was \"I like chicken, cheese, and ranch. What can you do with that?!\" So, when my culinary adventurous husband threw out Heirloom as a date night destination and I checked out the menu for the evening we planned to go to find many things I couldn't pronounce or recognize, I was the epitome of anxious & I wasn't too excited...  When we arrived at Heirloom, we were greeted by the most effervescent & enthusiastic host who introduced us to the concept of Heirloom and showed us to our seats. (If you're totally unfamiliar with Heirloom like I was, just know that there's \"fresh & local\"...and then there's Heirloom. On an entirely different level. Everything in the restaurant down to the alcohol and decor is from NC. So, the menu changes daily based on what's available.) Our server was equally enthusiastic & positively fabulous! He had been a chef at another restaurant and explained to us that he came to learn at Heirloom as they have an entirely all-hands-on-deck approach that finds him \"foraging\" for local herbs & spices and collaborating to help create the menu. His knowledge of each dish and its preparation was positively remarkable! The utter passion of everyone that we encountered was so inspiring that my nerves were immediately calmed.  We did the tasting menu, comprised of small plates. You can choose to order a la carte or to go for 6 plates or 8 plates to share. My husband and I opted to go for 6 plates to share. I let him pick the dishes. The only \"safe\" option was a steak plate, so I was still a little uneasy & planning to leave a little hungry. Once we ordered, the \"bread cart\" arrived. The bread is, also, different almost daily based on what's available and what the chef wants to do...and the bread cart will make its rounds throughout the meal (we probably got more bread 8 times...) The night we went to Heirloom, it was a heavenly salted herb bread. I begged to take the bread cart home after the second bite of bread, but...alas!   Then, the plates started arriving. After the bread & staff's insatiable enthusiasm, I was already convinced to try ANYTHING because if I didn't like it at Heirloom, I wouldn't like it ANYWHERE. I tried raw oysters for the first time, savored the best cut of steak I've ever had, enjoyed the most flavorful meats, and even got duped into trying a sweetbread (yeah, that one was a bridge too far for me, personally...My husband ate every bite though!)   But, y'all, every plate (sweetbread excluded for me!) was positively phenomenal. I ate things that were lightyears out of my comfort zone. But, I actually found myself enjoying the adventure by the 2nd or 3rd plate once I realized how positively exquisite the execution is at Heirloom. It was truly a meal that was an adventure from start to finish. Each dish was something I'd expect only to find there. Heirloom is more than just another restaurant. It's a passion project for everyone involved and that shows through in each and every bite that comes to every table & very detail of the experience from start to finish!",

Unfortunately, on the first night of restaurant week, almost every dish tasted burned.  The pasta was clearly homemade, but too thick and hence slightly undercooked (this was the What's Up Doc featured on the Charlotte Agenda only days earlier).  The wait staff tried, but the busser was not having any of it that night.  It was a long drive out to this place for someone without a car, and we had waited for this night for a while, but we just couldn't get behind the ambiance (more run down old lodge than romantic rustic), the service, or the food.  Glad to have checked this off the list, as it would not be a place I want to keep wishing I had gotten to go to (really love the idea of it), but we won't be going back.  Great concept, but didn't meet expectations at all.  For $100, I expect more than one dish to merit a thumbs up.",

Come visit for just that and some wine... spinach salad amazing... I seriously have zero complaints... my husband and I shared everything because we wanted to try as much as we could..

He said they don't even have mixers for liquor because you can't get things like pineapple juice in NC- WOW! The menu having your name on it is a nice touch, since usually a place this expensive is reserved for special events.  We started with cocktails. I ordered the \"I Trust You\", which is simply letting the bartender know what you like and having them make you something. Mine turned out great! This is the type of place to do this because you know the bartender is good. My husband had the Feature, which includes pickled dill and spinach (kinda weird) but we liked how different it was. We later had the Amaretto sour and the Winter, which were also great cocktails.   We did one tasting menu and then ordered a main course and some sides as well. Our main course was a chicken dish. It really needed more seasoning. We also had corn bread, and we both liked the free bread they brought to the table more than the corn bread.   Everything was good, but for the prices I just expected more. I have had better food that is cheaper. I am not certain we will be back. If anything, we will come back for a cocktail, but it is an odd place/location in town for a happy hour.",

    "text": "Came here for their tasting menu but found out their were actually doing restaurant week so we ended up doing that. I was actually a little disappointed because I find that restaurant week menus usually don't accurately reflect a restaurants quality but it certainly was a lot cheaper! $35 for an app, entree, and dessert.   Bread course came first with some butter, this was ok and didn't really stand out.   For apps bf and I got the blackened shrimp cocktail and chowder. The chowder came in a very cute cup and was surprisingly light for a chowder? It seemed more like a soup and was quite clear and was really good, the name just threw me off. My blackened shrimp were great, the shrimp were huge and perfectly cooked though you could tell that it was cooked over a gas fire by the taste. The cocktail sauce was house with I think a tomato base. Do not eat it by itself, it's quite salty!   For entree I got the shrimp and grits and my bf got the fried chicken. I definitely had a lot of shrimp this meal. My entree came with a bed of grits with corn and assorted other things and a line of shrimp on top of it. It was pretty good, a little too salty. You only really notice at the end of the meal though once it has built up. The grits were otherwise perfect for me, very creamy but no cheesy flavor. The shrimp and corn were pretty necessary to impart that extra punch of flavor so it was a nice combination. I could have used maybe half the grits they gave me though! haha   My bf's fried chicken was also massive haha. It was a giant hunk of chicken that looked very nice and tasted really good but the skin was not crispy! I'll give them a pass since they are farm to table rather than a specialized fried chicken place. It came with a mini skillet side of mac and cheese which was quite good but once again there was just so much food!   For dessert we got the cheerwine pound cake and the cheesecake. I was pretty disappointed with my pound cake, it was very dry and every component just made it more so. The cake itself was dry, there was a thick but melted chocolate smeared on the bottom which was dry. The cheerwine sauce, I'm assuming, was drizzled on but there wasn't nearly enough I couldn't really taste anything? Also it kind of soaked into the cake and made it a strange mix of soggy and dry?? Overall I was not impressed. My boyfriends cheesecake was quite good, it was deconstructed with the actual cake part, the crust was a crumble of peanut butter and chocolate and it was quite a good cheesecake that tasted fairly light for a cheesecake.   It was my boyfriends birthday so they actually brought out two pieces of homemade turkish delight, honey and champagne flavoured and that's exactly what it tasted like! Fresh honey and some light champagne. That was actually probably the best part of the meal because the delights were quite delightful and it was my bf's first time trying one.   Everyone in the staff was so nice and probably wished my bf happy birthday ten times and they definitely made us feel welcome. The decor was very nice, kinda hunter's lodge without all the mounted heads. There's plenty of parking but as people mentioned it is a bit of a drive.  Overall I didn't really notice any extraordinary freshness in terms of the ingredients and I could've not known where the owner graduated from college but the staff was just so nice it made dinner very enjoyable.",

    "text": "My wife and I were anxious to visit Heirloom to try their 6-course chef tasting with wine pairing. Not many restaurants offer this type of dining experience so we were eager to visit Charlotte, specifically, to visit Heirloom. They have a standard menu we're familiar with seeing in these types of modern/southern restaurants; shrimp and grits, steak, crab cakes, etc. Their menu changes every three months but their tasting menu changes daily, based on the local produce available that day. Our meal consisted of salad, soup, crab cake, duck breast, cheese plate and carrot cake. The crab cake was the best I ever had. Very meaty and immensely satisfying. The duck breast was superb. It was very juicy with a slight crust on the outside and lightly drizzled with a sweet duck au jus. The portions were generous. My wife and I were completely stuffed before the desert came out. The wine pairing was ok. We weren't blown away by the wine selection. Each glass that was served was quickly introduced by its vintage, name, location and taste profile. I'd prefer it if the server could explain how that each particular glass was intended to compliment the meal. Overall, we had a pleasurable dining experience.   My wife and I were very satisfied and we had a great time. I guess my hang up would be the words \"chef tasting\". I'd rather it just be called a 6-course meal, instead. To me, chef tasting means the chef would come to your table to meet and greet and talk about the reason for his inspiration for today's menu. The wine would be served by a sommelier with a more detailed explanation of the wine and the reason for it's pairing. I won't fault the restaurant because of my expectations. If you're looking for high quality southern food, this is definitely your place. However, the foodie/adventurous side of us will cause us to continue our search for that epic dining experience elsewhere.",

My husband and I visited with another couple for Restaurant Week and we were so impressed. The ambience inside was so romantic. Almost everything there is locally sourced and you could tell by the freshness of our food. So back to the food. I had Oysters on the Half Shell and they were divine and the sauces they were paired with...OMG! The next course for me was the HFC (Heirloom Fried Chicken) with Mac & Cheese. The chicken was seasoned, moist, and crispy, what more could I say! It was everything fried chicken should be. The mac & cheese was also delightful. Next up was dessert, Duck Fat Funnel Cake, it was just ok, not sweet enough for me, but I love decadent desserts....so hey, no stars lost for that. Everyone else loved their food as well. The service was also Top Notch and I can't wait to return, which will be sooner than later!",

Every staff member -- from the host that welcomes you from behind the rustic host stand to the girl that makes herbed olive oil for you table side -- knows all the intimate details about every bite of food and sip of drink you'll take that night.   Before you stop reading (I'm wordy, I know!) if you do anything at Heirloom, get the 'I Trust You' cocktail. For $13, you tell the sever what you love in a drink (I listed mojitos, Moscow mules, fresh fruit and herbs) and any dislikes (nothing too sweet and no fennel/licorice for me) and the bartender concocts the most amazing drink just for you! Mine was a berry, bourbon, herbaceous concoction with a little bit of fizz that I affectionately named the Taryn. The only bad thing about this concept is that they admitted they probably couldn't exactly recreate the drink again that night much less the next time I visited. But, whatever! I trust them to craft something equally delicious the next time.   The menu at Heirloom changes daily depending on what the chef can get his hands on through local farms, butchers, markets and yes... even foraging himself. My boyfriend and I shared the 12-course tasting menu. It sounds like a lot but is actually the perfect amount for two, in my opinion. You can also choose 3, 7 or 9 courses and even order a la cart. At $120 (or, $60 per person) for the 12-courses, it's not any more expensive than other fine dining spots in Charlotte.   Each course is presented by a staff member that explains the dish with such amazing detail and flare. You'll know where every ingredient came from and savor every bite that much more as a result. Every thing we ate was amazing -- even dishes I expected to dislike. I hate radishes and loved the radish salad (2nd course). I don't typically love duck; I think it tastes fatty and greasy. You guys. This pan seared duck (9th course) was one of the best things I've ever tasted. Anywhere. If I hadn't known better, I would have sworn it was medium-rare filet.   As if all that wasn't enough, Heirloom also hit a home run with dessert. It seems like so many great restaurants (Good Food, I'm looking at you) stumble on dessert. Heirloom takes a swing at dessert and knocks it completely out of the park. We had popovers with apple, cinnamon, graham, bourbon ice cream, caramel goodness. It was so good, it made the chocolate cake with figs and cherry compote that followed seem pedestrian (and, it was really anything but)!   So, long story short... Get to Heirloom! Don't let the location -- randomly tucked away in northwest Charlotte, off Bellhaven/Brookshire Blvds.-- scare you. Plan to stay for a couple hours and just soak in the entire experience. You won't be sorry, I promise!",

    "text": "It's been a few years since my first review of Heirloom, last night I gave it a second chance to win me over... here is my update.    Bees... they have installed bees on their roof for menu options like motz balls with beeswax salad. I absolutely loved the salad, but the cheese tasted like fermented corn.  Not sure if it was the beeswax and cheese combination, but something made an unpleasant flavor that was shared by my three friends eating with me.  I then had some jalapeno and carrot top soup that incorporated peanuts for a very nice flavor.  The dishes they served it in were tree stumps and tree leaves (creative designs).  I then had homemade noodles with cheese that was most certainly a huge win!  Noodles were obviously fresh and well seasoned.  I then had the eggplant lasagna, made with what the waiter described as \"grocery store  globe eggplants.\"  I really enjoyed the hearty flavors, but the eggplant was chewy and both my friend and I agreed it should have been served with a serrated knife.  Next up was cornbread with tomatoes and a cheddar cheese grated over it.  It was very good and plated well.  Lastly was the spice cake with blackberries that were frozen with liquid nitrogen so that individual seeds could be separated from the blackberry cluster.  I would love to have an entire spice cake, minus the cream surrounding it (personal preference, nothing to do with quality of cream).  I'm a vegetarian, so I told them to bring me the 6 course tasting with my dietary restrictions in mind.  I feel like they did well with my request.    We brought our own bottle of wine from California, and they charged a 15 dollar corking fee (very reasonable).    The bathrooms are a bit strange!  Heads up.   The only thing I will repeat from my original review is that lighting and seating just isn't right.  If you sit on the wall, there are no lights so you have no idea what you are eating. The tables in the middle of the room have lights over them, but they are very bright compared to the other seating options with very little light.  If design is the biggest concern I have relative to my last review, then I'd say they have made the appropriate changes to stay relevant with the Charlotte culture.    Happy eating!  They also give you sugar cookies when you are leaving :-)",

If you want fresh food that is locally sourced, cooked to perfection, and plated with artistry, then this is the place for you! Heirloom is a fine dining experience at a reasonable price, and given the above and beyond service, I couldn't recommend it more enthusiastically if I tried! I was impressed beyond belief at the quality and uniqueness of the food served, and even more impressed with the story told. Heirloom is a restaurant full of servers, mixologists, and chefs who care deeply about their craft and the farms in which their products are sourced. Come enjoy! I know I'll be back to bring my friends and family along!",

Driving by this place it is so unassuming that you may never know just all the goodness that lies within.  Walking in on a relatively non-busy night, my wife and I were immediately greated and shown to our seat.  The service was attentive without being over bearing which is greatly appreciated.  The food was beyond compare.  Not just the ingredients but the delivery and presentation all culminate in a True experience.  This place feels like home and by home, I mean cozy, comfy and at ease.  The decor is barn chic if you will and that fits well with the food pairing.  The wine and drink selection are put together with thought and care in regards to locality and intent.  That may be the perfect word to describe my experience and this restaurant, intent.  They have put intent and thought into nearly every nook and cranny here.  15 minutes from uptown CLT is just far enough to feel like you've escaped the next trendy bar/restaurant.  I'm good with all that.    PS. Parking, easy.",

The have beehives above the restaurant for honey and grow some herbs on the property as well.  Very much farm to table.  The ambiance of the restaurant is a bit odd - it is dimly lit, which is good for a romantic meal, but the restaurant seems very open with a large space which doesn't give it a cozy romantic feel.  Service was quirky but good and we enjoyed all of the dishes, but nothing was particularly standout.  I would have liked for there to be a signature dish or something that they are known for - in addition to the great concept - to make it a place that you love coming back to time and again.",

You can select 3 courses for $35 and it goes up from there. The courses are small. Be advised. This is not typical Texas portion American dining. Our server said it was bigger than tapas, but I would argue. The cheese course was 2 slices of cheese. (Served with a great apple butter) the beef tongue salad was 5-6 pieces of tongue with 3 pieces of green. The oysters were great, but 3. The chocolate cake was less than an oreo. I consider myself a foodie and LOVED everything I put in my mouth, I just think you should be prepared for high prices and small servings. Also, this service is pretty relaxed, so don't be in a rush. Great that the chef came out to present the dishes. Save this for special occasions. As a suggestion,  I would love to have a list of the farms they work with as well as more information about supporting them.",

So it is off the beaten path, 20 minutes down Brookshire or 20 minutes from Lake Norman, but it is WORTH THE TRIP.  The chef and the staff are passionate about what they do.  Local food, NC wine (don't be afraid, they curate the best, and it is good), seasonal menus, oh,  my goodness. We did the 12 courses and shared (do that, it is a lot of food even with small plates), and I have rarely experienced such exquisite tastes and perfect service.

Since I follow a vegan diet, I called the restaurant a day in advance of our reservation to let them know for the purposes of accommodations. I ended up ordering a vegan version of the six-course tasting menu, and I was blown away by the quality of the food and the care put into my dishes. Whereas most restaurants might veganize a dish by simply removing the animal-based ingredients, Heirloom took the extra step and substituted ingredients that demonstrated the chefs' know-how. For example, when my family got grated parmesan I their salads, I got grated walnuts on mine. That is to say: they make vegan parmesan the same way I would! The rest of the dishes were also of high quality and I left quite pleased that we visited this restaurant. If I'm in the area again I'd love to return for another helping.",

The chef clearly knows the business of food, not only in what he chooses to serve, but especially in the care he takes in highlighting quality ingredients.  The asparagus was perfect--repeat, perfect.  The desserts (I tasted two) were absolutely superb.  Service was warm, knowledgeable, and unobtrusive.  The price was almost embarrassingly reasonable.

A few of them were interesting, a few of them were depressingly mediocre (chalky bisque, miserably dry cakes, deep fried breaded duck that tasted like it'd been liberally doused in Frank's hot sauce) and not one of them really stood out.  Now I know the menu changes daily so there's every chance that we were there on an off day but when you're dishing out $150 a person and are at what's generally considered the best restaurant in Charlotte, I would have thought even off days would be better than that.  That being said, the staff was truly amazing and we had the pleasure of trying Chef Barlowe's pulled pork the next day at the Culture Festival and it was better than anything we'd had the night before!  In short, just be warned, that on an off night you could well be dishing out a lot of money for not much in return.",

    "text": "Had an early dinner there (5:30) last Saturday to celebrate our wedding anniversary. My partner and I are both vegetarians and had reserved the 12-course vegetarian tasting menu to share. The service was probably the highlight of the entire meal. The whole staff was friendly, accommodating, and extremely professional. I think we spoke to and were helped by just about everyone in the place, including the bartender who came over when he heard my partner homebrews to recommend his favorite beer. The atmosphere of the place leaves a little something to be desired. The decor is a bit odd and felt cheap, especially compared to the quality service we were receiving. You'd think we were in a 5-star/high-end restaurant with the level of service, but the decor just didn't fit.   The food was okay. I definitely had some favorite dishes that stood out among the others (the broccoli soup, pickle plate, rye flour pound cake, cheese plate), but the rest were just decent. I have two big complaints. 1) It seemed like a lot of the vegetarian dishes were simply dishes where the meat component was either omitted entirely, or replaced by another vegetable. Most of our dishes had no protein component at all, which was a big disappointment, especially since the restaurant seems to advertise as being vegetarian friendly. Despite the 12 courses, I left Heirloom very hungry! 2) Almost all of our vegetables were grilled. At first, I was impressed and thought it gave our dishes a nice char flavor. But after a few dishes, they all started to taste the same -- heavy on the olive oil and grilled. There are other ways to prepare vegetables! Some of the dishes could have been 10x better if the vegs had just been prepared differently.   Overall it was an okay experience. The prices were pretty high, for how I would judge our experience. I was also disappointed that our vegetarian menu cost the same as the regular (meat-filled) menu. I would have thought that the price would have been less. Our meal was a gift, so I can't complain too much, but I will not be going back to pay $120 for some grilled vegetables, no matter how good the service was.",

The portions are on the smaller side, but our waitress did an awesome job of explaining everything before we ordered so we knew what to expect. Every dish was so different and they also explained each detail of the dishes very carefully when they were brought out. The courses were obviously all amazing and decadent, and we had a hard time deciding what our favorite was at the end! We also got a flight of beer to try out 4 different beers and enjoyed them all. We were very impressed with the staff's knowledge and kindness. They printed out on the menu Happy Birthday Kate and did a few extra things throughout the evening just to make it special for me. I praised my boyfriend for picking such a fantastic restaurant to spend my birthday! We can't wait to come back :)",

The food, however, was mostly average. The purple sweet potato soup was bland and had an odd flavor. My wife's burger was overcooked (there's a difference between 'well done' and 'dried out'). My first piece of the fried chicken was excellent, but the second (larger) piece was nearly all breading and quite greasy. The homemade macaroni and cheese side was pretty good. My wife thought her butternut squash puree was OK (I tasted it, and thought it was bland and watery). We passed on dessert, though the restaurant was kind enough to bring out popcorn (with a tasty lime-flavored oil) and 2 peanut butter truffles - both as gluten-free/vegan birthday treats for my wife. And actually, the truffles were phenomenal. That said, I would have given up the truffles in favor a top-of-the-line meal. Not a bad dining experience, but there wasn't any 'wow' factor to call us back again.",

The restaurant is an old Mom & Pops restaurant with a badly rusted roof, tables and chairs were hard and uncomfortable, not fitting for the price paid. The restaurant was half full ( on a Friday night ) and we were squeezed into a two top between 2 other couples, very tight, there was plenty of room to spread us out. For $250.00 we left with bad taste in our mouths. Not to mention that they did not want to take a $100.00 gift card,visa. Later they said Chef would \"eat it\" and they would apply it as cash and they wanted the card. What did \"Eat it \"mean ? Grouper was good, bisque was good the other 10 items were honestly weird, salty or just bland. The cake for desert might as well have been stale. I would recommend Chef and the Farmer in Kinston, NC. That's good food and you can order what you want.  PS. There was no where to put our things, I put my hat and phone on the floor, so did my wife.",

The food and drinks are on par with any other restaurant in Charlotte. The biggest thing that I felt after we were finished eating is that the meal tasted like it was homemade. It was just really really delicious and satisfying and spot on. It wasn't over the top in a way that can detract from the ingredients themselves. Each one stood out on the plate and the flavors combined to compliment each other. Order a bottle of wine and enjoy all the local and NC sourced food and drinks. They even have NC rum! Who knew!

    "text": "My husband and I came to heirloom for the first time on opening night. Our server was attentive and extremely helpful. You could definitely tell that the atmosphere was to be intimate, farm to table fine dining. We were excited because Charlotte doesn't have anything like this. The problem was that it was a little too dark, which made reading the menu a little difficult. The food however was very well prepared. Overall, we were extremely happy.  We came here last night for restaurant week. New lights have been installed (we could read the menu!), but they are too bright and have taken away from the intimate ambiance. The first course was good, my husband had the tomato salad and I had the chicken and dumplings. The second course was lacking (both the sausage and the pork belly were over cooked), but the chef pulled through and really wowed us with the 3rd course. My husband had the filet which was prepared perfectly, but it was trumped (I know, how can you trump filet?) by the locally caught fish. Even my husband wished he had ordered it. The only way to describe it is that it tasted like someone had cared for the fish all the way through its life, death, and preparation. The dessert was interesting and tasty as well. We both had the chocolate cake. The flavor of the cake changed when you paired it with each of the sauces available on the plate.   The chef definitely puts a lot of thought, effort, and care into the food. You can never expect the same menu when you go to heirloom, which makes the experience new and exciting every time. If you're not a chicken, you can also expect to try foods that you would never think to eat, like beef heart, but know that the flavor and preparation is not going disappoint. I'm looking forward to trying brunch :)",

The servers are well educated to the local wines, local liquors, local decor and local food.  The building has been completely renovated to include a roof brought in from a barn to give the exterior a rustic look, the full bar is decorated with an extinct piece of cedar wood combined with pictures and memories from 7 generations of family in the chefs family. Some of the pictures in the building are of the farmers who personally pick some of the items for the Chef.  The menu is printed daily, I looked at a previous days menu to get an idea of the variety of selection and I cannot wait to come back and try it again.  My girlfriend is a vegetarian and the chef was happy to accommodate her.   The appetizer cheese biscuits they brought out were incredible! They prepare a fresh herb dip at the table for you to enjoy with the biscuits. The herbs were extremely flavorful  We each had the summer salads which were a great hot house tomatoes, house made mozzarella, and corn shoots with two types of oil.   I myself had the line caught drum. It was a generous portioned serving of the most perfectly cooked fish I have ever had. I am not a normal fan of Drum but it was delicious.   My girlfriend had a clover oyster mushroom steak with wild onions and Charleston rice. Served on a slate, the slate was a nice touch.  We were offered from amazing desert options but opted to not have desert last night.",

    "text": "I usually do not write reviews but felt compelled to warn others of this travesty of a restaurant. The multi course tasting menu concept was very similar to New York's Tavern on the Green's seven course menu. It is an attempt at fine dining and I can appreciate that. The taste of the food falls short of even your local Mexican dive. The waiter's attempt to sell a story that the chef spent the day out searching the countryside for the freshest organic farm raised ingredients that he could not find on his family farm was obviously contrived to justify the exorbitant cost of the meal. I have see other reviews that rave about the food and atmosphere but I cannot understand how anyone could enjoy the meal we were served. I feel like the child in Anderson's \"The Emperor's New Clothes\" screaming out \"This place really, and I mean really really sucks!!\" I cannot even make a suggestion as to how one may salvage the meal I ate there. I have enjoyed fine dining in the past and realize that an open palate is necessary to expand one's gustations. The premise of a farm to table is very exciting and could justify the expense of the meal if the food tasted good. At $150 per couple, one expects the food to be edible. Two of our items off the Taste Menu were so repugnant we did only \"taste\" them once, promptly spit it out and sent the remainder back. I use the word repugnant reluctantly because the English language does not contain a word the adequately describe the level of vileness of the soup we were served. I assume it was Old Sneaker Slime Off a Theater Floor Soup but I don't remember what they called it. I do have something to applaud The Heirloom restaurant on,  several times during the course of the meal my \"worst thing I ever put in my mouth\" barometer changed to a new level of revolting. Having eaten dry dog food in college on a dare and eaten prison food (as a visitor) this was an incredible accomplishment for a place that you have to pay to eat at.",

    "text": "Finally made it to Heirloom with Queens Feast Restaurant Week and it was an easy drink from central charlotte for Friday date night.   The reputation is entirely accurate - great meals with entirely locally sourced food in a repurposed space away from glitzy Uptown, hipster NoDa, or showy SouthPark. You come here for the food while making a statement with your wallet. Certainly one of the highlights of the Charlotte food scene, but I'll admit that my personal tastes will take me to return trips elsewhere.   We had a filling meal, but the interior space left a bit to be desired, particularly with the cold air rushing in during winter each time people used the front door. Credit for doing a good job to make it feel as nice as possible, but we never really relaxed during our visit. For as many staff members as we interacted with throughout the meal, it felt as if things were rushed, despite the fact our three courses we spaced too far apart.   Lesson learned? I wouldn't classify Heriloom as a fine dining experience, despite the artfully presented plates, but rather good food that is 100% local. You go here because you are steadfast in your interest in supporting local farmers and businesses.   Kudos for having their entire menu open for the restaurant week special. The most memorable dish was dessert: the black heart forest cake was picturesque and a sweet end to a good meal. Oyster appetizer was quite nice and I did take notice of all the empty shells outside when you walked in, which made me feel like I was near the water. The signature fried chicken was good, although not the best in the city. I like the old fashioned, per our waiter's recommendation, but the ice cube was too large for the glass, actually sitting above the rim of the traditional rocks glass, and made simply sipping the cocktail challenging.   I'm glad I went to Heirloom and would certainly recommend to anyone in town to check it out, as the food is good and I support their commitment to local ingredients. Solid 4 star spot, just wasn't totally wowed.",

    "text": "I had a private dinner of about 22 people at Heirloom this past Monday.  The restaurant is usually closed on Monday but they did open for our private dinner.    Drove past it initially because I was looking for a sign that matched their website logo but I finally figured it out.  Outside they have the most adorable planters and they are totally growing their own stuff (WHICH I LOVE).  Instead of mulch they have old bleached out oyster shells which I thought was an adorable touch.    Inside is country, homey and charming.  The bathroom reminded me of the bathroom in CBGB's circa 1985 (totally dating myself here).  I'm not saying anything but if you go there you will get the reference.  I thought the bathroom was a surprise and clearly a glimpse into the sense of humor of the owner.  I thought it was super fun.  Now the food.  OMG.....the food.  I am a huge fan of the \"farm-to-table\" movement going on these days.  When I'm in NC, I appreciate it more because farm-to-table in North Carolina versus New York isn't much of a comparison.  The chef at Heirloom is SUPER passionate about his ingredients and it totally comes through in his food.    The clams were delicate and tender, the pate was the best pate I have ever eaten in my life, the sweet potato smores (yes, I said SMORES) were the hit of the Hors d'Oeuvre table.  They also had these hen of the woods mushrooms dipped in batter and fried........Vegetarian Fried Chicken!!!!!  I'm enchanted.  My guests had a choice of the spinach salad, lightning cakes or butternut squash soup for their starters.  I loved the butternut squash soup and I heard the lightning cakes were a revelation and the spinach salad had a flavor everyone loved but couldn't quite determine.  I love a mystery.  Then the choices for dinner were the rib eye or the shrimp and grits.  I cannot be in Charlotte and NOT have shrimp and grits so that was what I ordered and it was amazing.  Perfect in every way.  The rib eye was HUGE.....I mean HUGE!  Everyone thought it was the freshest steak they'd ever had.    Then the dessert.  There was a chocolate mousse cake which went over well but I'm a cheesecake gal and the North Carolina cheesecake was INCREDIBLE.  First of all it was \"deconstructed\" which was such a surprise and served on these fabulous slivers of slate.  Amazing presentation.  Our server was beyond efficient, super friendly and knew everything.  She never broke a sweat.  Sadly, the bartender had an emergency so we didn't get to sample some fun mixology but the beer and wine selections were perfect.  In fact, I'm signing a contract to bring some senior executives there next month.  I know the Owner and Staff at Heirloom will make me look to my boss like the rock stars they already are.    GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!",

    "text": "I live less than 3 miles from this restaurant, pass it every day on my way home, and yet I had never dined there. I have been reading good reviews in the past but just kept putting it off because I thought it was all hype. After all, how good there be a five-star restaurant in a defunct Mexican restaurant, hidden in a west Charlotte neighborhood?   Well, I feel like I owe the chef/owners an apology. The hype is totally justified. My wife and I had the pleasure of eating at Heirloom for the first time on our 25th anniversary. It was a random slow Tuesday night, so I kept my expectations in check. When I set up my reservation weeks in advance, I had commented that it was a milestone anniversary. I wondered if they would remember. After being warmly greeted with \"happy anniversary\" we were seated in a corner table away from the 3 or 4 other patrons in the restaurant. The waiter came over and introduced himself with another \"happy anniversary\" and proceeded to tell us about the restaurant and how everything is sourced in NC. When he mentioned the catch of the day, he actually told us the fisherman's name - which was an impressive touch.  I knew Heirloom was known for their chef's tasting menu, but my wife and I opted to order ala-carte from the menu. We shared the fried pickle and chicken chips appetizer and I also had an arugula salad. For entrees, she ordered the pork schnitzel and I had the Heirloom fried chicken (their house specialty). For dessert, we shared the sweet potato creme brulee. In short, everything we ate was superb. The food was prepared perfectly, the presentation was practiced without being pretentious, and portions were gigantic, almost too big.  The building itself is pretty modest and could probably use an update, but I suppose that's in keeping with the sustainability vibe. But you don't go to Heirloom for the decor. The focus is on the food and the service. Both were exceptional. This is the kind of place you take out of town company when you want to impress them with North Carolina cuisine. Heirloom is for foodies without the snobbery of some French bistro. It is comfort food cranked up to eleven.  I made the right choice for my milestone anniversary. I'm just sorry I had not visited years earlier. Well done Heirloom. I hope you enjoy decades of success.",

The only thing we finished was our wine. We asked the server for \"another glass\" and he just brought us another empty glass from the table next to us- not the sharpest knife in the dr The building is old and outdated and the bathroom looks like something you would see in a sleazy, run down bar with writing all over the walls and stalls.

    "text": "As many have shared and is known, Heirloom is a little bit off the beaten path and certainly not what you would expect, given the quality of the food and service.   The building looks a little old and worn down, and the inside has some resemblance to a barn. Everything on their menu is local and \"farm to table,\" and if it can't be sourced in NOrth Carolina, they won't include it on their menu. Even the spirits and alcohol (aside from wine) is local to NC. Gotta love and respect that!  I was actually hoping to try their well known 6 course menu, but they were offering their 4 course Valentine's Day menu, so we tried that.  The service was very good throughout our dinner. Your water will constantly be refilled, they pour the wine for you, and food is timely. For Valentine's Day, they offered 4 courses for $55.00. I started with the Poached Egg for my first course, which included toast porridge, lamb sausage, charred jalapenos and some greens. This was good, except a little too spicy for me with the charred jalapenos. I think next time I'll ask for those on the side!  For the second course, I went with the NC Lump Crab Cake. These were delicious atop the beautifully colored sumac red rice. The crab cakes were tender and flavorful, and held together well. For my third course, I chose the crostini with goat cheese, apples, endive and a port wine reduction. This was perfectly light after the second course, but a great combination of flavors with the creamy goat cheese. My husband tried the blue cheese dish, served with popcorn and caramelized onion relish, which was a creative way to display the blue cheese, but the flavors meshed really well.   Lastly, for my 4th course, I chose the Cheerwine Pound Cake, served with chocolate buttercream,and  pepper and beet cookie crumble. I love ordering \"out of the box\" idea dishes, and I was pleasantly surprised with this dish. The pound cake was light and airy, but the beet cookie crumble added a pleasant sweet crunch on top. I'm a sucker for buttercream, so I loved the chocolate buttercream as well. We also enjoyed the lemon smashed cheesecake, served with roasted blueberries, graham cracker and lemon curd. It was perfectly light and creamy.  I would definitely return to Heirloom to try their signature 6 courses sometime in the future!",

So I brought my lovely wife here for dinner.  Chicken and dumplings to start was excellent. Lots of tasty vegetables in there. I can't remember the last time I had rutabaga. Yummy. The sweet potato soup was also good.  Ribeye steak (a $12 upgrade) was a terrific piece of meat. I loved that they trimmed the steak *and brought the trimmings on a separate plate!* Great cut and grilled perfectly to the medium rare we requested. I chose the crab cakes and they were excellent. Very well loaded with crab and little filling, a very nice taste and texture. Perfect crab.  Dessert was the only imperfect course.  I chose the apple cake and while the cake was very good, being topped with a rather hard ginger cookie made it difficult to eat. The deconstructed elderberry cheesecake that Mrs. chose was the better option.  Service was top notch excellent. Very, very good attentiveness, sincerity and appreciation for us choosing their restaurant. I love that Heirloom is focused on local sourcing and North Carolina vendors. From the meat to the sauces and the beers/wines. I wish more places did this.  We'll absolutely be back.",

We did not receive our drinks from the bar until 40 minutes after being seated. I would guess we ordered 15-20 minutes in (that was the first opportunity we were given to do so). By the time we received our drinks my boyfriend's Sour Grapes just tasted extremely watered down and my white wine flight was warm like they had been sitting on the bar. Our poor server was just extremely overwhelmed with an entire side of the restaurant filled with tables.  Nothing we had to eat was very memorable, but nothing was bad. The BLT Sliders were mostly bread, my fried chicken was dry and the mac and cheese was very watery, the Shrimp and Grits were just okay. However, I definitely appreciate the concept and everything being locally sourced.   The best part of the experience was finding a good Sauvignon Blanc from NC and sharing a bottle of that.  The only other recent reviews that aren't great were also from Sunday night so seems like they were just having an off night, but still disappointing.",

    "text": "Where to begin? Typically, we are opposed to restaurant week dining, simply because of the increased demand on the staff and generally the menus can lack their normal pizzazz. Not the case here!   The four of us had the perfect dining experience, even during restaurant week. The menu was full of great choices and all the food and drinks are local to NC. Wife and i had the raw oysters, tomato soup, cornbread & molasses, ricotta ravioli, duck confit, angel food cake, and baklava. And let me tell you, the portions were big and delicious! Our favorites were the cornbread, the onion pie that came with the duck, and the oysters. Dessert didn't blow us away, but still good.   Wine and cocktail menu was excellent. Typically I'll get a beer or a whiskey drink, but went with the white sangria here and it was great!   The inside of the restaurant is gorgeous; a bit deceiving from the outside! Service was impeccable. Our waiter Jason was on point and engaged in plenty of conversation, despite the restaurant being full. He even explained how one of the menu items (Philly cheese steak) was because the owner lost a bet on the Superbowl :-P  We will certainly be visiting this restaurant sooner than later! We can't wait to see what's on their menu next visit!",

We had an 8:15 reservation and once we were seated it took well over ten minutes before we ever saw our server.   We were told the bread was takin so long because it was in the oven but it was cold when we got it. The appetizers were good, big, but good. But then the entrees started coming out. One of our groups took over 5 minutes longer to be brought out then the rest. And once again we thought it would be hot, but everything was luke warm at best. Except the Mac n cheese, that was scalding hot. Three of us got the chicken, and my God, I don't think I've ever had more dry chicken in my entire life. I could hardly swallow mine.   Our server was polite, but we never saw him between courses, he never checked in on how the food was, and at the end of the night it was obvious they were ready for us to leave.   Needless to say, we will not be back.",

The 4 of us did the tasting with pairings and it was nothing short of incredible! Gracelyn was our server and she knew everything about the menu as well as the source of the ingredients. Everyone there is super friendly and informative. Don't let the price fool you, you definitely get your money's worth and the place isn't so fancy that you can't relax. You honestly feel like you're in your grandparents' old farmhouse with family. The meal was more like an experience than just dinner.",

    "text": "Let me start this off by stating that I only give five stars to restaurants that can truly change my ideals and make me feel a very special time of way.  This place has done that; this place has changed my mind about what it means to spend on quality.  That being said, Heirloom Restaurant gave me such powerful feelings that truly made me tear up a bit.  The first that I noticed about this restaurant started from the outside, with the hundreds if not thousands of oyster shells laid around the entrance as a rock decor.  Speaking of design, I have to say, the entire building feels high quality but still extremely cozy and at-home.  On to the service.  Gracelyn, if you're reading this, you are incredible.  So prompt, so professional, yet so friendly and inviting.  Though she was our main server, the rest of the staff was equally amazing.  Everyone really made us feel as if we were the one and only in the whole building.  Now the food...  My goodness.  The biscuits were the perfect amount of crisp yet soft, toasty yet fluffy.  The Spinach and Goat Cheese salad was incredibly delicious and the Farm Chef salad was something out of this world.  The fire-roasted tomato soup brought me straight back to childhood, the glory days; so simple yet so powerful.  As a preface, I HATE grits and cole slaw, but let me tell you something.  I ate EVERY bite of everything that was served to me tonight.  The grits were mind-blowing, the slaw was so juicy with just the right amount of bite.  And don't get me started on how godly the duck and HFC were.  And now for one of the items that truly did bring a slight tear to my eye.  The carrot cake...  I have had a large variety of carrot cakes and nothing has ever come CLOSE to the power that this carrot cake had over me.  Ann Marie, you are a saint and I love you.  The one and only issue with this entire experience?  When I walked into the bathroom I was a bit thrown off.  Not really because of the graffiti, but because it was rather dark and dank in there.  But let me be the first to tell you that that does absolutely nothing to my review of this incredible place.  Clark, it was fantastic to meet you, you and your amazing staff have given me a truly life-changing experience.",

Our first course was an artful salad served on slate.  The presentation and balance was wonderful.  By the time our entree arrived, mine was cold. I don't mean cool or not hot, I mean COLD.  Smashed potatoes with a pork tenderloin and fresh made onion rings all stacked.  The potatoes were warm but when I cut my pork, it was not just cold but had frozen granules inside the raw pork.    I sent it back to the kitchen and the waiter was very apologetic and offered a meal replacement which I declined.   The manager came next and he too was very apologetic and offered anything they could do to make up for it.  He offered some hot tea which he brought out himself which was delightful to have as I was seated under a blowing fan.  The desert course was definitely nothing to write about.  Bland piece of 1 1/2 X 3\" chocolate cake.     Overall, nobody at my table was thrilled with their meals except for the salad but mine was the only one not cooked.  The food was extremely disappointing, especially reading all the great reviews but I have to say that the service was outstanding.  From the moment we were greeted until we left, everyone from the wait staff, the bar staff and the manager were terrific.",

    "text": "Based on reviews and what we've heard from friends Heirloom seems to be a tale of two restaurants. Unfortunately, the tale is akin to Jekyll  & Hyde.    We went to dinner with another couple having heard about the restaurant from friends. It wasn't crowded at the time, yet the waitress was, let's say, less than prompt. After being seated for about 10 minutes she finally came over to us to take our order. Never asked if we would like a drink, and was less than helpful.   We had high hopes for this restaurant having heard good things from several friends.  Unfortunately that was not our experience.   All of our orders were less than impressive  The chicken I had was stringy and not particularly flavorful.  The salad had some kind of julienned vegetable on top of it that literally tasted like, and had the consistency of, straw.  I appreciate the farm to table concept, but the fact that the source is local is not enough. The food should also taste good, especially at the prices charged for such small portions.  Other reviews have mentioned, and I agree,  the ambiance gives me the impression they're not sure what they want to be: a rustic farmhouse or a white glove restaurant???  The friends who suggested we try this place later told us they've gone for lunch several times but not dinner. So maybe the lunch fare is better.  Unfortunately,  based on our first experience I don't think I'll be finding out if that's the case.",

I had no idea what to expect when the four of us showed up to Heirloom for dinner. I knew that Chef Barlowe does a kick ass job of sourcing local food and I knew the quality would be stellar but I was totally caught off guard by a 12 course tasting menu. Whoa, Nelly. 12 courses?!  We started with cocktails and I was excited to be able to get a local kombucha since I was not drinking. My friends all had a great assortment of cocktails and local wine throughout the evening - 12 courses gives you plenty of time to drink. The waitress explained that we could do any combination of courses so two of us opted for 7 courses and our husbands went with 10. After perusing the menu, I was excited to see that all but 2 courses and the desserts were gluten-free. I easily ordered 7 gluten-free courses and patiently awaited their arrival. The courses were presented one at a time, whenever the table seemed to have a match - all of us ordering the same thing - the waitress brought out the same meal. The courses were very well sized and the waitress was very knowledgeable about which courses were more substantial than others. After 7 courses, I was definitely full, and I didn't even order a dessert course. However, not to feel left out of dessert, at the end of the meal, while my table-mates were enjoying their delicious looking treats, I was presented with two ginormous pieces of flourless chocolate cake. Amazing! And so thoughtful. I was told the pastry chef did not want me to feel left out. Our entire experience from start to finish was enjoyable and we cannot wait to go back. If you are looking for a restaurant experience that is completely different from anything out there right now, give Heirloom a try!",

The decor was very interesting as they had jars of vegetables like you see in your old Italian grandmothers kitchen on every shelf. There is torn an tattered quilts hanging limply from the walls. It appeared as if they ran out of money when renovating and decided to use whatever was in the basement from 1986 to finish. Now that the atmosphere has been established lets move on to the food. The food was just OK for the price. I wasn't blown away or knocked out of my chair when I put it in my mouth.

We did the 12 course sharing to celebrate my wife's birthday. Sharing was definitely the way to go and the 12 courses let us experience all that Heirloom had to offer. Best dish by far was the duck confit. The chef even personalized the menu for us to take home. The location is a bit out of the way in the middle of no where. We weren't even sure if it was a restaurant that was still operating until we walked in and immediately greeted. I feel the location is a bit of a stretch and would be better served closer to town. Only 5 couples in the whole place that night. It was nice to have the quiet though.",

    "text": "Disappointing.  My husband and I enjoy fine dining -- whether it's featuring unique dishes and presentations or simple cuisine with fine ingredients and great execution.  We were therefore excited to try Heirloom during restaurant week.  Our experience was underwhelming.  First the food.  Although the menu is interesting and the ingredients seem to be top-notch quality, the execution left much to be desired.  Some examples: 1.  Beet and butter lettuce salad with chevre and black walnuts:  unless the chef meant \"beet greens,\" there were absolutely no beets in the salad.  The chevre was a single, miniscule morsel, no bigger than the tip of a pinkie finger and the black walnuts came in the form of ground dust on top of a couple of lettuce leaves (no discernible flavor).  On the plus side:  greens were fresh and delicious...the vinaigrette was lovely. 2.  Chicken and dumplings:  although the gravy was savory and rich, the dumplings had a peculiar crunchy interior (?).  If this was part of the chef's plan, we probably should have been warned when the server was describing all the ingredients and their sources.  (My husband and I enjoyed the explanations -- but a fellow diner found them pretentious and tedious). 3.  Crab cakes, sumac rice, and confit of broccoli rabe:  portion was generous.  At least one of our crab cakes wasn't \"browned,\" it was burnt on the outside.  The sumac rice was crunchy on the inside (not al dente as one would expect from risotto, but noisily crunchy - undercooked?) .  When I've had vegetables confit, they've usually been poached in oil to give them a silky texture.  I'm not sure I saw any broccoli rabe (a turnip-like green) on my plate...there was broccoli which appeared to have been steamed and given a quick char on the grill (nothing wrong with the veggies, just not what was advertised). 4.  Desserts:  disaster!   The smashed cheesecake looked like a ball of cream cheese that had been covered with graham cracker crumbs;  it tasted like a ball of slightly sweetened cream cheese that had been covered with graham cracker crumbs.  The apple cake was cloyingly sweet -- and the apples had their peels on (I know, some trendy desserts feature the peel).  For us, the peels gave the dessert an unpleasant and unfinished texture.  The vegan chocolate cake was dry.  Other considerations:  Some find the atmosphere cozy and charming.  We found it too dim - bordering on depressing (but kudos to them...it was not pretentious!).     Service was spotty...sometimes attentive, other times bordering on rude.  Example:   One diner, who didn't care for her dessert, asked if she could have one of the vegan peanut butter truffles that had just been given to a vegan at the table.  The server curtly said:  \"We don't have those here.\" and promptly turned on her heel.  Yikes!  We heard another diner (at another table) being told that she shouldn't take her crabcake home because it wouldn't be good the next day...huh?  Maybe not optimal, but we've taken plenty of crabcakes home from restaurants and found they were perfectly fine a day later.  It really struck us (rightly or wrongly) that the server just didn't want to be bothered.  Bottom line:  there's nothing horribly wrong at Heirloom (hence the 2 star review which stands for \"I've experienced better\") but on the night we dined there was nothing special.",

Two of us shared the 7-course and came away very happy. The food was extremely flavorful and the dessert was also delicious - blackberry ganache with white cake. Portions are perfect for the tasting menu - we left full and happy. Will definitely return for another menu.",

I had driven by the building, and thought it was a farmers market before reading reviews on Yelp and seeing the Groupon.  The outside is a bit rough, but the interior is much nicer.  It would be nice if there were some more divisions for a little more privacy.  The group at the table behind us we having a good time, but using the 'F' bomb, and that wasn't good.   The food was excellent, as was the service by Ashley.  I will agree with other reviewers that a bread basket would be better than a single slice of bread.  The timing of the food was perfect, and we left satisfied but not uncomfortable.  Very fresh and excellent food.  This is not an inexpensive restaurant, so be prepared to spend a little.",

    "text": "The farm-to-table menu is really unique, which I appreciate, and we had a good experience at Heirloom for restaurant week.  We're both mushroom freaks, which turns out to be a great fit at Heirloom. The mushroom bisque with truffle grilled cheese was excellent - easily the best dish that we had. The rest of the food was all tasty (I ordered shrimp & grits, Goose ordered rib eye steak).  I admit that I'm a bit perplexed by the overall atmosphere at Heirloom. They pair white tablecloths and formal wait service with tacky carpet and farmhouse decor, which was just super odd. The service wasn't great, but I cut them a little slack since it was restaurant week. Our appetizers came out before our wine did (personal pet peeve), and even then I had to call the waiter over and ask them to bring it out.  Overall, it was good food but nothing that I would drive out to Timbuktu for again!",

    "text": "Heirloom does so many things right.  I so wanted to give this a 5-star, as the experience is as important sometimes as the taste of the food.  Alas, there were a few missteps so I have to give it a 4-star...this time.  Here's the deal: I visited during restaurant week.  I'm not sure that is the best time to judge the veracity of a restaurant, but I've been to enough to know that there are many who get it right during that time.  So until I visit again, and I will visit again, this 4 star review will stand.  We arrived at our reservation time and were seated promptly.  There was a copy of The Velveteen Rabbit at our table waiting on us: that was the drink menu.  Charmed!  We ordered drinks and perused the large Restaurant Week menu.  Seems to me they have all of the choices they'd have on a normal night!    The server brought my tea, but the funny thing was they didn't have Sweet n' Low.  He said they serve their tea unsweetened, but have a simple syrup that you can add to your liking.  It was perfect, because you can add what you want, so lovely if you don't like your tea as sweet as we normally drink in the South.  When they bring out your drinks, they offer you a roll with a shmear of honey butter and that was amazing.  I swore I was going to leave it alone so I'd have room for dinner, but I couldn't.  It was just too good.  For our first course, we got Chicken Chips and Fried Pickles served with Buttermilk dressing, Texas Pete hot sauce and rooftop honey.  I had no idea what chicken chips were, I just thought it sounded interesting.  It's chicken skins, fried up crispy like a pork rind.  And yes, they were good!  The fried pickles were my favorite though.  I love the briny bites dipped in buttermilk dressing.    My partner got Chef-Foraged Cream of Mushroom Bisque with pine needle gremolata and a slice of truffled grilled cheese served as a garnish.  The soup was deeply and richly flavored.  The slice of grilled cheese was amazing, but the portion sizes were so huge, on both appetizers actually, that we couldn't finish it all.  A very strong dish!  The main course was where things went sideways for me.  I got the Shell'em Cioppino - tomato sauce, fennel aioli, NC wild mussels, clams, and poached fish, garlic sourdough all in one huge bowl.  Sounds perfect for me, a seafood lover.  The problem was the poached fish tasted mealy, and the whole dish had a very unappetizing un-fresh fish smell.  I tried a clam and realized that was where the smell came from.  I pushed it away and my dining companion gave me a bit of hers, so I was perfectly satisfied.  Hers, it turns out, was amazing!  She got Mills Family Farm Ribeye Steak with garlic crushed potatoes, applewood bacon, Brussels sprouts & beef jus.  Every single aspect of her meal was divine.  The ribeye was trimmed for her, with the fat cap served on the side.  The steak was amazingly tender and so flavorful.  Every bit as good as Ruth's Chris.  The potatoes were hearty and creamy.  But the showstopper were those Brussels sprouts.  Roasted with a little vinegar, they had a bite and the slight char gave us a smoky sweetness that we loved.  I think that was our favorite food item of the night.   Desserts.  If you've read up on Heirloom, you'll notice that sometimes they have swings and misses with their desserts.  For us, this was the case.  Oh, they were fine.  But not special.  I got Carrot Cake Whoopie Pie: carrot cake, Clover cream cheese, blueberry-rainbow carrot sauce served cut in half.  The carrot cake was really dry and the cream cheese was super sweet.  I took one bite and was done.  My friend got Chocolate Sourdough Cake - Piedmont Bleus Chocolate, wild yeast sourdough starter, Ran-Lew dairy buttermilk glaze, seasonal flowers.  I liked it, but she wasn't crazy about it.  It was just very plain, nothing fancy, and not awesome enough to hold down the dessert course on its own.    At the end of the night, the waiter recognized my uneaten entree and removed the charge for it over my protests.  That was unexpected and kind and I feel they should get a pass for one entree that went out that didn't appeal to one diner.  I will definitely make my way back to this wonderful restaurant.",

Even the liquor is all NC (if you're looking for a good NC vodka recommendation try TopO). I was floored by how much I loved the mushroom bisque, because I can't stand mushrooms. But somehow the chef transformed them and I think that was my favorite thing I ate all night. The restaurant was also extremely accommodating for the large party size. They gave us the private room and allowed us to split the checks as many ways as we needed to. The service was also very good.  I am very happy with my first experience and I will be back.",

    "text": "My experience here was awful - no AC, incredibly overpriced, and poor service.   Our group of 7 was thrilled to dine here and we made a reservation well in advance. We walked into the restaurant and were met with a heat wave; we inquired about the AC and were assured all was well. We sat down, waited about 10 minutes for a waitress to come over, again inquired about the AC and were assured all was well. Later we learned from another server that the AC was out for a portion of the restaurant- it was 91 degrees in NC today ... the AC was needed and was certainly expected at an expensive restaurant. They texted and called us multiple times the day of our reservation to confirm it - they should have mentioned the AC being out so we could have chosen to go elsewhere. When we left the restaurant it was a breath of fresh air and we got in the car to see the temperature outside was 80 degrees - so clearly the temperature inside was well over 80.  -Value:1/5, we did the tasting menu with wine pairing and had a cocktail each; it was $300 with tip for the 2 of us. I would not pay $30 to eat this meal again.  -Food: 2/5, I would not choose to eat any of the 6 courses again. The salad was soaked in dressing, the rabbit was over cooked, the duck was incredibly salty, 3 tiny pieces of cheese  - nothing impressed us. Even the dessert was bad - crumbled cake which we all agreed tasted like cornbread.  -Service: 2/5: We all ordered cocktails and they came out sporadically. When we inquired about the food on the tasting menu we were told one thing, and when the food arrived it was different than what we had been told. -Decor:1/5, Not my taste but I'm sure some will enjoy it- there are quilts on the wall and jars of food, until you go into the bathroom which is covered in graffiti and did not at all mesh with the remainder of the restaurant. The stalls were so tiny you knees hit the door. I believe the stalls must have been purchased from a dive bar.   Overall - I would never recommend this restaurant. I was the only Yelper in the group so I asked the others for their scores - some said 1 others said 2. No AC on a 91 degree day ... come on.",

We went on a random Wednesday and made reservations ahead of time but we were one of two tables in the place. I started with purple haze drink which has strawberry hemp vodka and blueberries. It tasted a bit like licorice but was good. We went through the tasting and everything was incredible. I dug into a few dishes immediately and missed taking pictures but by the end we were super fat and happy. The service was great and we didn't feel like we were being rushed and I appreciated that he offered us a second yeast roll and honey butter! I'd like to go again not for the tasting menu to try some of their other menu items but the tasting was incredible. Also, as a librarian I loved that the drink menu was in a Velveteen Rabbit  book and the check came in a Nancy Drew book.",

We arrived at 6:30 with reservations and ordered cocktails while we reviewed the Restaurant Week menu options. Our server answered some questions we had and we proceeded to order. I had the Raw Oysters to start, followed by the tuna and the Peach Cobbler for dessert.  The oysters and tuna were both good, but unfortunately the Peach Cobbler had to be sent back. I think it had spoiled or coddled milk and the smell and taste was awful! I decided to ask the waitress to smell it and her face and comment was appropriate, something was wrong. Shortly after the pastry chef came out and apologized and offered us milkshakes on the house..top notch service if you ask me.  The others enjoyed their dinners, especially the Fried Chicken, but overall everything was just okay and I honestly had expected and hoped for more.  Overall, I am glad I went and would love to try it outside of Restaurant Week, but based on this visit not sure I would return anytime soon.",

It was different but very flavorful. The wine paired with this was delicious   Second course: green garlic bisque. I wasn't too fond of this so the waiter brought out a roasted tomato soup and that was really good.  Third course: crab cake and corn salad. This was absolutely phenomenal!!!!!  Fourth course: ribeye with brussel sprouts and potatoes this was great as well. I loved the brussel sprouts.  Fifth Course: cheese and jam. This was my favorite course!!!!  Sixth Course: cornbread cheesecake. This was also amazing.   I am so full I can't even proofread this review! So please excuse any typos or grammatical errors LOL! Our waiter was awesome, this is such a great place. The food was also amazing. We will definitely be back.",

Wasn't crowded and wasn't loud which I appreciate on restaurant week..   Food: 4/5 broiled oysters with truffle oil BLT sliders: 3/5 the bun was cold and the bacon was tough Chicken chips/fried pickles: 4/5 very nice and crispy  1 lbs meatball with semolina pasta: 5/5 soooooo yummy Fried chicken with Mac and cheese: 4/5 didn't care for the Mac and cheese but chicken was good  Ribeye with Brussels sprout and mashed potatoes:  5/5 nicely done.. We had it done medium well. Came out perfect.  Angel cake with seasonal fruits, honey and mint.. soooo good but my overly sweet  Peach pudding with wafers and ice cream: very good.. we ended up putting over our angel cake  Chocolate cake. Overly sweet. I didn't finish.   Special note: Sara, our secondary waitress is the sweetest that they come.. our table is her favorite which nice. Her service along with BJ was great. Honest everybody was good and soo pleasant.   We loved the honey soo much that we asked Sara about it. Come to find out, the chef have been a bee keeper since he was 15. And they have a couple of hives on top of their roof at the restaurant. Love it and will be back..",

    "text": "Heirloom is a hidden gem and a top five restaurants in Charlotte. It is rich in flavor and will make you want to go search for the recipes to try to make them yourself .   I truly enjoy knowing they support local businesses aspect of cooking with local ingredients. This farm to table didn't disappoint us at all. I believe if you are not use to tasting real food you may have a problem with the taste as it may have different textures than highly processed foods.   It may have been the night we came but everyone was on their \"A\" game as the food was delicious and service was insightful because every meal was explain very well. We did the tasting of six courses and full disclosure if you are hungry this is enough for two people. I would recommend doing the tasting to share and get two to three sides instead of another entree to split as well.   Since we did the tasting and a meal to share I literally walked out of there having to take a button down on my shirt to allow myself to expand. We shared the fried chicken entree with Mac and cheese and slaw. The Mac and Cheese was definitely good and creamy! The tasting was great as my favorite in the tasting was the braised duck and soup.   We were told the tasting changes each night so it gives each person a unique experience each time. We enjoyed every dish from the salad to the dessert! I can't wait to come back and try even more flavorful, fresh and truly unique masterpieces! I think you will find this in your top five too.",

Prior to ordering the waiter (who was great!) asked if there were any allergies. I like when restaurants do this personally because I have a raw onion allergy.   This time we ordered the 5 - $25 charcuterie board. We chose to do 3 cheeses and 2 meats. It was served with little grilled crostinis, a homemade jam, olives, and a local hot mustard. It was beautifully presented and delicious.   Next we ordered, my husband ordered the fried chicken (which he has previously ordered and loved), my girlfriend and I ordered the trout which was served over a bed of bean succotash, and her boyfriend ordered the 1 pound meatball.  After ordering the waiter brought out rolls to everyone. I was a little disappointed because the last time we were there they served little biscuits. Which I love!  Everything looked great. But my husbands meal was by far the least satisfying. The mac and cheese... unsure if they changed the recipe was nothing like the first time.   We decided to forgo dessert, but when you pay your bill they present you with a little to-go cookie. I love this touch!  I know this restaurant is seasonal and I am sure we will be back... I just hope its a little better next time (and I'll update my review accordingly)!",

    "text": "Definitely a bit out of the normal rotation for us, but it can certainly be worth the trip. We arrived just as they opened, both because of our schedule and because we were likely a bit casual. I mean quite a bit casual. Hey, if you're out running around and happen to find yourself someplace, you do what you can, right?  So we arrived and asked - they didn't seem to have a problem, so we went with it. The staff was totally fine with it, and seemed happy to have us there. That was awesome. They told us about both the regular menu and the tasting menu as we came in, and then after we sat down, our server even knew that we had certain preferences (for instance, if we wanted to swap an item on the tasting menu for something else). That's pretty cool.  We opted for the tasting menu, mostly because we like to try things, and figured what they heck. This offers a salad, then a soup, then an appetizer (you can actually choose from two), then an entree, then a cheese, then a dessert. It's a good bit of food, however you'll want to realize a couple of things.  First, you can swap things out - so if you don't like the entree, or want something else (say, you want to try the fried chicken instead of the steak, you can do that. Or if you don't like the potatoes that come with the steak and want mac and cheese, they are pretty likely to help out there too. It's some of the best service around, actually.  Second, while it's a lot of food, the portions are not what you would get if you ordered off the menu. For instance, that steak is a few slices of steak, not an entire slab of beef. So if you're worried about value, you may want to order from the menu instead. It's a solid value, but you may get more food by ordering individually (although you may actually pay more if you want all the items together).  As can be expected with something like this - namely getting six courses delivered over a couple hours while other tables order off the menu - it can be a bit spotty, where you get a salad and then a soup in fairly rapid succession, then wait a while for your appetizer and so on. But it works, just allow yourself some time.  As to the food, it's good, but be prepared to eat. And though they let us in when we were dressed casually, we were not sweatpants casual. It would have helped.",

We tried the lightning cakes, oysters, catch of the day with succotash (more of a stew than succotash), nc Carolina tuna, angel cake, and chocolate cake. The ONLY thing we liked was the oysters raw. We ended up taking one bite of the desserts and tossing it. The rest of the food was a struggle to eat. I am thinking that maybe they're known for southern food and fried chicken and that's where we went wrong by getting seafood. The service was very very slow. We were there for about 2 hours.",

    "text": "Wow... There's just no way I can remember everything I ate. We came here to order from the a la carte menu but how can we pass up a six-course meal with wine pairings for every course! Well... We kinda had no choice because our Groupon was only valid for the tasting menu but hey... I'm all for 6 glasses of wine!  This is only our second time here and I'm so glad we got the tasting menu because it's the restaurant staple and the biggest reason everyone comes here and we didn't get it the first time we came. What's even better is that it changes every day and it's a unique experience every time.   Course 1: A granny Smith salad with a bunch of things I can't remember. I do remember dandelion dust however because it made the salad so delicious  Course 2: Green garlic bisque. Green garlic broth with chilli oil and pecans. This was very different. I wasn't really a fan of the soup but if you bit into the pecan and took a sip of the paired wine it was like a party in your mouth. What was great was that neither my wife nor I like the soup and they offered to switch it out with another soup. This one was a roasted red pepper tomato soup. This one was better than the initial offering and no I'm not a fan of tomato soups it was really good. The ingredients just tasted so fresh.  Course 3 Corn and green beans topped with crab cake and squash chips (should have been rabbit ragu but I'm not a big fan of rabbit and they gave me the option to do something else). I have no idea what was on that corn but it was so amazing. Additionally goes thinly sliced and fried squash chips were out of this world. So unique and so delicious. I can easily eat a whole bag of those instead of potato chips.  Course 4: Fried duck breast with roasted Brussel sprout. The accompanying sauce was so good with the brussel sprouts. The duck breast was prepared in a way that I've never had it before. It was medium like a steak but it was crispy on the outside. I would have to say by far it was the most amazing girlfriend I've ever had.  Course 5 By far my favorite course and probably because I had low expectations. It was some form of goat cheese which was much better than regular gold cheese my dad had with wine Berry jam and garlic crostini. Oh my gosh!  Crouse 6 Dessert. Usually the ferry but I was slightly disappointed. 10 points for creativity however. It was a cornbread pound cake with some lemon reduction on the side. Not a big fan of lemon butter pound cake by itself was pretty tasty.  Highlights: 1. They were just so accommodating! They swapped our soup when we didn't like it and switched our entree courses (both entree courses for my wife and 1 for me)  2. If six courses including dessert wasn't enough they also gave you a snickerdoodle cookie to go home with  Honestly, they could have easily gotten 5 stars. In fact my wife gave them 5 stars but for me the fact that I didn't love my soup from course 2 and I was disappointed in my crab cake I have to give them 4 stars. Nothing I ate was bad at all but for me the ball was dropped in those instances.   Room for improvement: None... Well a location closer to me  would be nice since I live in S. Charlotte lol",

We chose to have the 12 course meal so that we could get the taste of everything on the menu. Our server very patiently helped us choose a wine that would go well with the food. The first few courses were salads. The dishes we loved the most were the sunburst farm tomato salad, Salem hills angus beef, and the cherry upside down cake. The memory of fresh tomatoes and vinaigrette taste in the tomato salad still lingers on our palette. I highly recommend dining in this restaurant.",

    "text": "Intimate dining experience in a nice environment. I'd call the food farm to table nouveau southern with a twist. We went the first week (really the first day because of snow after the grand opening) for Valentine's day. We selected the V-Day sampler, which was four courses. The salads were very good with some pickled beets and I believe freshly foraged goodies. There was a lot of flavor from the spices, it wasn't an over-pureed dressing.  We both had the Oysters for the appetizer, they were amazing. One was raw, and I believe the others were steamed and broiled respectively. They were all prepared perfectly.  For the main dish my wife had a beef heart sampler, which was prepared three ways. I took very small samples of each, and it seemed good. I've never had been heart before, so I had nothing to compare it to.   I had pork belly, which was served with sweet potatoes, and something pickled (I'm still not sure what). The pork belly was very good, and the pickled veggie and sweet potatoes paired really well. The pork was cooked to perfection.   Dessert was excellent, it was a \"smore\" tart. It was fantastic. There were candied graham crackers and bruleed marshmallows. It was just great.   Everything in the restaurant, including the alcohol is from North Carolina.  I didn't have beer, but I would have liked to have seen Asheville beers in addition to Charlotte. Not knocking the CLT brew scene, but limiting to Charlotte would not have been the way I handled it.  Our server Franklin was very well spoken, intimately familiar with the details of the menu and the story of the chef, which is what brought me there in the first place. We ordered a bottle of wine that they had just run out of and they upgraded us to something else, no extra charge. He also didn't have us look at the menu again, he brought out two suggestions to let us pick from as an alternative, which I appreciated.  My only real complaint for the night, and the reason I didn't give it five stars is that, for the money, I would have liked a little larger portion of pork belly. I'm not talking Golden Corral, but for $90 for dinner for two, we got salad, three oysters each, and I got a couple ounces of pork belly and some sweet potatoes. The food is phenomenal, but with the bottle of wine and a tip it was $150, so I would have liked just a bit more from the main course.  We will be back, we live a few miles away near the Whitewater Center. I'm hoping for good things for the restaurant, hopefully when I come back I'll get a little larger portion and I can up my review to five stars!",

The service was fabulous, not overbearing, but very attentive.   The restaurant, itself, has a warm cozy aura, and nice soft lighting for a romantic dinner.  Because there is carpeting, and the space is large, it is not deafening like most restaurants these days.  Now to the food.  It was really wonderfully prepared and very fresh. Farm to table with eveyrthing from North Carolina, including the sweet potato vodka Martini!  We had the tasting menu.  My favorite dish was the sunchoke soup, with a parmesian crouton in the center.  There was a little kick to it which was nice, but not too spicy.  I loved the fried beets, and I don't even like beets, so that was a first.  The proportions were a bit large for us, as there were so many, but they were great about letting us box things up.  The dessert was attractively placed on slate, and was really yummy.  A mixture of different flavors and shapes.  Overall, presentation was wonderful, you could tell everything was fresh and flavorful.   I look forward to dining at Heirloom on my next visit!",

The ambiance is uniquely open and not crowded - perfect for a date night.  You can guarantee I'll be back and bringing lots of friends and family along the way.",

When we arrived, the initial sommelier/hostess was also really great and we were happy our party of seven selected Heirloom for my birthday dinner. It took a while for them to take our order, but after that happened, things went downhill. Appetizers and salads were all good. However, it took almost an hour between appetizers and entrees with no word about the delay and no apology for the delays. The food was unremarkable with the exception of the crab cakes - the crab cakes were above average.  The fried chicken was average and was served in almost chicken finger style - boneless breast pieces. The macaroni and cheese was flavorless. The steak was average. They entire 3 course meal took two and a half hours.  Desserts were also unremarkable to below average - apple cake was not very good at all. I am sad that this is how the restaurant was. I had hoped for more. They have taken on a courageous location and need to work on their timing. It was a good night for business, but by no means overwhelming and should not have resulted in very slow service and average to slightly below average offerings.",

    "text": "This place, yall. Classy, warm, incredibly hospitable, somehow also laid back, and so so yummy. To me and my husband who just went here for our 2nd anniversary, it's everything we love about North Carolina (a state we absolutely love!) in a meal. The chef manages to pull out (or just not mess with and highlight perfectly but not pretentiously) the earthy, ocean-y, bonfire-y elements of our beautiful state. (He also seems humble, approachable, warm, and creative.) Make sure you eat at least some bites of veggies and tell me you cannot taste the life story of that plant. And it's True that the staff are incredibly attentive, skilled, accommodating, warm and flexible without being stuffy. We went on a Wednesday night and I only made a reservation a few hours before, but they still attended to our dietary preferences and other picky requests we had. (I am kicking myself I didn't tip them more. Next time though...next time)   The atmosphere is homey but classy. A bit bare, but still warm--think minimalistic graphic drapes next to cork and barn wood with chalk board accents, white table cloths, sparkling candlelights and warm vintage lamps. More eclectic and rustic than most \"fancy\" restaurants, but I prefer eating a great meal there than more sterile or flashy places.  This is definitely our favorite restaurant now, and to us, a perfect business homage to North Carolina's spirit.",

    "text": "\"Adventurous\" maybe, but I just wanted a good meal. Very disappointed. Service was good, wine and desert were pretty tasty, but nothing else was even passable. Beef was too tough to chew. Many courses were overcooked or overly dependent on creative seasoning to make them acceptable. Scallops were the size of small marbles, and oysters were not much bigger; no amount of creative seasoning can make this a tasty  dish. Coffee was from a French press at the table, but was weak and tasteless. For $119 (9 course meal, two glasses of wine, two coffees) not counting the tip, I expect something really special. I think too much is made of \"local\" and \"organic.\" Restricting yourself to these criteria makes it difficult to produce a really delicious meal.",

    "text": "I bought the Groupon and did the 12 courses (small plates to be shared) for 2. I wanted to try it all. I hear the menu changes weekly so accomplishing this has got to be a huge undertaking. I do believe the chef is talented and I saw some of the brilliance come through in a few of the dishes. The problem here, in my humble opinion, is that the chef is trying too hard. Heirloom should focus and perfect their best dishes and add specials based on seasonal items. Many of the dishes (the salads) and the overly-foodie concoctions (which I have to say I typically LOVE) just didn't fully work (but rounding up here from a 2.5).  The finale of the duck, (we must have literally gotten the last duck of the evening as it was all dried out) was a bad way to end the dinner portion and the desserts following fell a bit flat. The bacon in the desert -- was like a episode of Iron Chef \"BACON\" and it didn't work. The other dessert was a bit bland (dry and not sweet enough). The sweet bread freaked my date out but I found it kind of interesting/different. Nothing bad or terrible here and as I said, some courses were really good.   I loved the local, organic, sustainable concept of this place and why I wanted to try it and love it. I also loved the edible flowers in the salads, the presentation and overall creativity of the dishes. A+. The staff was especially nice too -- especially the host. While I think the talent of the chefs is legit at Heirloom, they simply need to work the bugs out (figuratively of course!)  I will be back.",

My bride made the reservations for my b-day and from start to finish this place was an absolute experience. Feels like the place is in the middle of nowhere and is not what you might expect from the outside, or inside for that matter... Super quirky, rustic, non-pretentious are a couple of words that come to mind but it works and I love the personality of the place. We were warmly greeted and our server Madison was super friendly, passionate and knowledgable.   Madison recommended splitting the 12 course tasting menu and it was just the right amount for the two of us (note that we were both saving stomach real estate all day in preparation for the goodness!). You probably picked up from the other reviewers that this place changes the menu regularly which isn't unusual, but this chef changes it DAILY based on what is available at any time in NC and it is spectacular. Gastronomic Genius - period. I could go on and on about each of the courses which really won't do you any good given the menu is constantly changing, but it was all very unique and well done with a couple of dishes standing out that you aren't going to find like the lamb heart tartare (sounds weird I know but Anthony Bourdain raves about it for a reason I found out). The cocktails are also on point, especially the Bee Sting if you are a whiskey fan that likes a kick - provided by habanero. The coolest thing was the option to order a drink called \"I Trust You\" which is basically an option to tell the waiter what you typically prefer about different cocktails and the mixologist makes a drink just for you. Mine had some sort of pickled carrots and spice with ginger beer and it was awesome. Again, not going to get this everywhere so do yourself a favor and experience this place sooner rather than later!",

The mac n chz was not fully cooked. The ribs and duck was too salty. And all that \"extra\" crap looking like seaweeds on your plate. I didn't like the idea of the tiny flowers sitting on my food either. I can understand the concept but the prices definitely doesn't reflect the fine dining experience we are accustom to. And then all the crap about the owner traveling around in NC to fine the best quality to cook with for the week is bologna! I feel that's a part of the \"selling\" but it was a flop for us! And he told us the chef went on Bobby Flay and Chopped! The food did not reflect that kind of talent.   If you are looking for a great dining experience this is not the place.

To be fair, we did have to eat & wait for 6 courses! I think the food came out timely but I think we waited a little too long for the server to take our order & to get our check. The bad reviews on here disturb me. The food tasted delicious & elevated to a fine dining experience. Service was fantastic. I LOVED the atmosphere. It's rustic & eclectic.

My boyfriend and I took his family here last night for Restaurant Week, and we were all pleased with our food. The beeswax and mozzarella salad is amazing- PLENTY of mozzarella and tomatoes. The heirloom fried chicken is tasty, especially with the gooey truffle mac and zesty slaw. The cheesecake dessert is de constructed and full of flavor and little surprises of brittle and chocolate. The plates and bowls that they serve the dishes on are beautiful and the ambiance during dinner is lovely. Every single staff member is inviting and kind. I just love this place!

Both the staff and the food are young, friendly, and un-pretentious.  It's hyper-local farm-to-table fare. For instance, the honey comes from beehives on the building's roof!  This is some of the best food I've found anywhere in the world and the prices are a fraction of what you would expect from a high-end restaurant uptown.

    "text": "We decided to check out Heirloom for Charlotte Restaurant week.  We arrived right on time for our reservations and walked in.  We were standing in the entry way a couple of minutes before we were acknowledged.  I did not realize, but I think the hostess stand is to the right as I saw people going there after we were seated.  That area is not visible as you walk in, you just have to know this.  We were promptly seated.  I appreciate the fact that their tables are disbursed out and you are not on top of each other.    They come around with blue wine bottles that are filled with water to start you off with.  It looks refreshing, but it is lukewarm, and that is not how I like water.  I had to ultimately ask for some iced water.  Kevin started off with a beer, and I asked for a glass of wine.  Unfortunately they were out of stock of what I wanted. Not cool!  So the waitress offered something else, and I was just not a fan.  She asked how I liked it, and I told her I was not a big fan, it was not the wine I wanted.  And that was that.  A little disappointed she couldn't offer something else.    Both of us went off of the Charlotte Restaurant Week menu.  We each ordered the different item so we could essentially taste every item they were offering.  They first started us off with some corn bread, I'm not a corn bread person, but I thought it had great flavor. For the first part - the salad was pretty good, but the chicken and dumplings had a lot of flavor!  I loved that!  Then for the second course we had sausage and pork belly.  The sausage had a nice flavor, but the pork belly stood out, so good!  For the third and main entree, I am not the biggest fish fan, but Kevin said it was good.  The steak was really good, along with the potatoes.  Last was dessert, which was some chocolate mousse type cake and a berry shortcake.  I am a huge dessert fan, but both of these were unfinished.  They were just a big miss.  The chocolate cake tasted like something I could get anywhere.  The berry shortcake was different.  I actually liked the concept and it looked like a local southern desert.  The berry part was good, but the biscuits were a miss.  I looked at their actual menu for the day, and each of their entrees were around $28.  We got four courses for $30, so I cannot imagine paying $28 for the main entree like the steak we received.  Maybe you get larger plates with their main entrees??  I don't know, but it will be hard to return without it being restaurant week or some special occasion.  One last note, the service was okay.  Their process is slow, we were there for almost 3 hours.  It did not necessarily feel slow, but they would take their time between each course, so you weren't rushed.  By the end though, we were itching to get out of there.  Overall, pretty glad we checked out a local place and enjoyed the food.",

The server was incredibly rude once he did acknowledge us. We told the manager about our bad service and he offered to remove our beverages from the check but that did not happen which is fine...we did not complain to get freebies, we just wanted decent service. Here's a summary of our food experience:  Fried chicken - much better at Carpe Diem Truffle Mac & cheese - worst Mac & cheese I've ever had  Pork belly - very fatty but good flavors  \"Specialty\" cookies - burnt  Way overpriced for what it is. So many other better restaurants in Charlotte.",

It wasn't just the food or the service, it was the entire night. I called ahead and placed a reservation for my girlfriends birthday. I was greeted at the door with custom menus wishing my girlfriend a happy birthday (mind you, this was my first time dining here). Who does that?!   We were curious about the menu and decided to go all the way and order all 12 courses. It would be an understatement to say that the chef knows what he is doing. Every course blew us away. From the pumpkin soup to the chicken hearts, yes chicken hearts(my favorite dish of the night). To top it all off we were served complimentary drinks from the chef. It brought tears to my girlfriends eyes. Completely amazing experience. I will be back and I will be telling everyone I know about this place.   Literally farm to fork. Every dish tasted as if it were prepared moments before we ordered it. Thank you. I can not wish you guys enough success.",

I can say that there have been courses I flat out didn't like (tabbaco ice cream and bitter chocolate, yuck) and others that have absolutely amazed me.  Bottom line, if you want to see something creative and different, this is your place.",

It all started very well with the hostess seating us with menus that said Happy Anniversary on them. Our waiter Adam, seemed very knowledgeable and gave us some hints on the menu. We ordered the appetizers of fried pickles and their oysters Carolinafeller, both of which were excellent! The wine he suggested from NC was also excellent. My ribeye ordered MR came out almost well done, our waiter nowhere in sight, I had to flag down the hostess to get it recooked. The next one came out very rare. The desserts of \"deconstructed\" persimmon pie should have been called disappearing persimmon pie, as there was no persimmon fruit to be found anywhere...we would have loved some coffee with dessert, if we'd only been able to get our waiter to wait on us. They did discount our bill by 15.00. While I would love to have a go to farm to table restaurant, this experience will definitely give me pause to think about going there any time soon.",

The decor is cute, the drinks were good.  But the food? Is it because I attended the murder mystery dinner that the food was awful? Was there a different cook? The only good thing about my meal was the bread and olive oil! I had two slices to combat the two drinks I had.   Everyone at my table had the chicken  cacciatore except one who had the pork. My dish was inedible at best - dry chicken and tasteless sauce atop something that resembled riced cauliflower? The guys pork? Meh. He said the best part were the onion rings.  The salad was ok. Small and uneventful. At least some goat cheese was added to flavor things up. Don't get me started on the dessert, though. I didn't think chocolate cake could be so depressing. I couldn't eat it. Some table mates decided to go out for wings once the murder was solved.  Speaking of, the troop was good. They were funny and really tried to entertain the crowd. For a groupon, it was fun. But don't come hungry because the food is just nothing. Noting good to say about it.  Will I be back to try on a normal night? Probably not. I'd hate to waste any more money on terrible food (recipes I can make myself for cheaper and more flavorful) and a babysitter.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I should've left a review over a year ago when   Heirloom was an exceptional experience. After visiting multiple times over the last 2 years, we hadn't been back in the last 5 months and with our family in town decided to pay them a visit, given we have had nothing but the best experiences. We had reservations for Friday evening for a party of four. We were promptly seated by the hostess - who was amazing throughout the evening - but it took a solid 10 minutes for them to provide water & for our waitress to show up. The restaurant was busy, so not sure if they were short staffed or if they are just extremely slow these days, but it took over two hours from start to finish. They changed their course format from 12 to 6 courses & the waitress blamed it on \"that it's too much work for us to provide 12 courses so they switched it to 6\". We still wanted to do some sort of course sampling, so we started with a cheese plate as an app and each ordered an entree with small plates to share. Our cheese plate took 20 minutes to appear, after it made it's way to other tables in mistake. When our courses finally came out, the duck was burnt/dry, the fried chicken was good, the shrimp and grits was just meh, and the vegetarian hen & potatoes was great. Overall, from our past experiences where the waiters/waitresses take the time to talk through each dish and provide where everything is sourced from (they don't do that anymore) to the wait time for all of our dishes/drinks - we were not impressed. The cost is the same, so you're going pay a decent amount for a mediocre meal with awful service. Heirloom *used* to be our favorite restaurant in the CLT area & unfortunately, we will not be back after our recent experience.",

But please don't serve me plain old Texas Pete as a sauce just because it's from NC. Do something with it. Or find an organic NC pepper sauce and Create your own sauce out of those ingredients. From the environment and prices, I was looking forward to some classic fine dining. What I got was very bland and disappointing. Mac and cheese could have been so much better with a properly prepared sauce. It had a hard crusty texture and mild cheese flavor. Not creamy. Pasta had a chewy rubbery texture.  Fried chicken was edible but lacked any flavor. Marinate it, add some garlic herbs something. Mix the local honey with a local organic pepper sauce and drizzle it on the plate. It was Served over a zesty slaw which made it soggy on the bottom. It's ok to use fresh local ingredients along with some fresh herbs for flavor.  I was able to eat this meal. I just wasn't very impressed. The service was great. Other than the manager saying from our looks we might want to order al a carte versus the full course meal that cost more. Although I am still trying to figure out why anyone would serve a fried chicken skin app like it's a delicacy. And they Served it with the famous NC hot sauce \"Texas Pete\". NOT!!! This was just a very strange disappointing dining experience!",

However, it really isn't that far. Uptown peeps it's 15 minutes. Took me 20 minutes from the Steele Creek area on 485. Don't let the perceived distance keep you away.  Enough about that, on the to the experience. Exterior looks like an old Calabash seafood place. Inside has been updated and is very welcoming. We were greeted promptly and taken to our seats. Wasn't busy at all but it was also early, 630. The server was very knowledgeable of the menu for Restaurant Week as well as explained the 12 course meal. We all made selections from R.W menu. I had the cucumber tomato salad, the scallops and the blueberry jelly roll. It was all delicious!  The presentation was great. The timing was spot on.  Oh. Forgot to mention the freshly chopped herbs for the olive oil paired with the freshly baked bread that was prepared table side. That might not be necessary but a nice touch.  Everything is local which is awesome.  This place is legit. Make the small ride and you will not be disappointed.",

Now, you can order 3, 5, 7 courses instead, but we adventurous and went for the whole 12 and split a pairing. The food was delicious! Everything was flavorful and the plates were art. I am glad we had the FULL experience. But I wouldn't recommend doing all 12 courses and a half pairing, as I was too stuffed and tipsy by course 10. I probably would have been fine at 5 or 7 courses. The hard part then will be picking which courses you want to eliminate. But that is a good problem to have.   A really cool thing is if you have a dietary restriction, when you call for reservations a week or more ahead, they can tailor their menu around you and your party.   Always call ahead as they have private parties a lot. This really isn't a drop in kind of place.",

    "text": "Hubby and I stopped in on a Wednesday night . Wine was great , raw oysters as well . The service was also wonderful . The only thing was my pasta dish was not that tasty and I was a little upset because I had been looking forward to this place forever . My husbands burger was not cooked correctly but they fixed that immediately. I can't put my finger on the taste of the lamb pasta dish but the sauce was not yummy it was white with a weird flavor . I am a foodie and can't explain what flavor it was . We will be back for another try maybe I just ordered the wrong thing .",

    "text": "My date and I each did the five course tasting menu.  Absolutely amazing!!!!  There was not anything we tried that we didn't like.     The wine selection was great and the waiter assisted with our options.    We originally showed up for murder mystery and then when that was cancelled we stayed to enjoy the menu.  I'm glad we did.  Now when you drive up don't be deterred.  Appearances can be deceiving and they are.  There is some fine dining behind the facade.  Then the decor is a little rustic on the interior but don't let that fool you either.  The service is great and the food is excellent.",

The best dining experience and worth the price. from the drinks to the desserts!! This is our go to place for special meals.  Don't believe anyone else here. The service is excellent  . Every time we go!! Friendly and always willing to accommodate your personal needs. The menu changes all the time . Exquisite!!.. It is not for people with the Olive Garden, Red Lobster mentality. This is REAL FOOD !! Too bad its expensive. But its worth it ... you feel like you should after dining out ... Not stuffed .. but extremely happy !!  LOVE THIS PLACE !!",

I told him what I was looking for and he told me that he would make it a wonderful experience.   Fast forward to 08/26/17.   My mother was so impressed both her and my aunt.  they said they were treated like queens.   They were over the moon with the Happy Birthday Menu's and left there very full after enjoying the 7 course tasting menu with a special fig surprise from the chef.   Thank you so much for making my mom and aunt feel like queens for their birthdays.",

    "text": "As great as my experience was a year ago, my disappointment this visit was on the other end of the scale.  I ordered the 6 course tasting menu. Last visit, each course came out with an explanation of the ingredients and execution  (after all, the differentiator here is supposed to be the ingredients, right?), but tonight,each dish was brought out and not explained (just- here's the beet salad, here's the duck, etc) and I had to ask what was in each dish to try to appreciate it more. Once the runner even said, \"I don't know, you'll have to ask the server\".  And, the food this time was just not that great either. The salad was so overdressed I could not taste the ingredients. Both pickled dishes (seabeans and the collard kimchee) were so vinegary it made me cough. The duck breast was chewy and the \"onion pie\" served with my friend's fish dish was mushy. I also had ordered a bourbon neat, and it was very harsh and raw to swallow - I had to just give it back. This visit made me sad, as I have told so many people what an awesome experience I had the first time. I hope it was a one off, but I won't come back.",
