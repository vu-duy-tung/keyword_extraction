    "text": "After recommendations of my fellow Yelpers, I had to try dd peckers for their wings.  The wings are really good here and definitely one of the best places in Charlotte.  The wings are big here and the chicken is moist and flavorful and not fried to a crisp like many places.  The Hot Gold flavor is very tasty as others have mentioned.  Love the mustardy flavor to it because I LOOOOVEE mustard anyway I can get it.    The place is small and it's not fancy, pretty much a neighborhood bar that serves food,..good food at that.  For your other enjoyment there are about 10 TVs around the restaurant, 2 video games in the front and a jukebox to the other side of the door.  I sat in the bar area..  The bar stools were very uncomfortable and could use some updating.   Service was spot on considering there were only 2 people working the front.  Price wise, I paid $14 for 15 wings and a tea.  Not too bad considering the size of the wings.",

    "text": "I've been on a gluttonous tour of Charlotte's unhealthiest restaurants lately. My latest endeavor was the oddly named wing joint d.d. Peckers in Pineville. I've had my fair share of wings from many a local and chain restaurants, and honestly to me they all seem very similar. Like most wing places, they have a bar, a multitude of TVs, and ample wing flavors. Something unique they offer is their fried broccoli cheese balls, which may induce a heart attack, but at least they taste delicious. Kudos to them for making their wing flavors taste distinct from each other, so many wing joints just douse their wings in different sauces and call it a day, but DD's prepares them with more effort, and my taste buds could tell. Their wings are meaty and tender, and their cheese fries are some of the best I've had. Totally worth the drive to Pineville if you're in the mood for wings.",

The menu has lots of burgers, wraps, and wings (lots of flavors) available.   I ordered the chicken breast strips on a stick and a side salad. My husband ordered wings in Caribbean flavor and raw fries. The food was just ok. Nothing spectacular. Service was ok too.   I ordered the mild sauce on the side of my chicken breast strips. Personally I think it had a little too much vinegar. The Caribbean sauce my husband had was better. We flagged the waitress down (took a few minutes) and I ordered the honey mustard sauce to replace the mild sauce. It was a little better.   Guess you can just say, dinner was ok. Nothing more.",

    "text": "I met up with a friend for lunch because I saw one of my facebook friends check in here one day.  They commented on how good the wings were. So, I made a mental note to try them out.  I entered the restaurant and greeted my friend.  The waitress (a blonde lady) came over to take my drink order.  She delivered it promptly.  She came back to take our order and once our order came up and she delivered it to the table we NEVER saw her again.  She never returned to refill our drinks or even ask if we needed anything.    There was a guy passing our table, so I stop him and said, \"Excuse me sir, I know you are not our waiter, but..\"  He abruptly interjected, \"Well, I guess I am now, what do you need?\" So, I asked for a refill of my drink and he brought it back to the table without saying a word.    So, we are waiting.....and waiting....and waiting....almost afraid to ask for the check.  My friend says to him, \"May we have our check?\"  He states we have to come over to the bar to pay.   To make matters worse he acted like it was hurting him to talk to us, like we were bothering him.  BUUUUUUUUUT, was chatting it up with the older WHITE gentleman at the table next to us.     I hand him my debit card, he runs the card and then THROWS it into my open hand.  I HAVE NEVER, EVER HAS SUCH A BAD EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE!!!!! I am standing there staring at him like, NO YOU DID NOT!   I DID NOT leave any tip, and I also took a picture of my receipt just in case they tried to charge a tip on my card.  The food was sub par and the customer service was non-existent!   I will never go there again and I don't recommend it to anyone else.  Especially if you are not of the European decent!

Yes. But then again, that's why it is a dive bar. However, in my opinion some of the best wings in town. THE best fried pickles for sure. We had fried pickles---piping hot and you gotta give them a few minutes to cool off. Wings--we did 10 hot and 5 bbq---extra crispy. The hot were a fantastic hot--just what you expect--saucey and HOT. Even the bbq were a bit spicey, or was carryover from the HOT? Also had fries--nothing to write home about. Crinkle cut fries served right from the fryer. The Philly was good too. Bread was way better than I expected, beef was well seasoned.  Overall, great food and definitely a place to check out.",

Customer service and satisfying their guest is definitely not a priority for them. While yes, it is a small wing spot, it gets great business but there's never enough servers working. While they usually only have 2 servers working...everything seems like such a hassle for them, and can be very rude. Not welcoming at all. Rude with to go orders, and I have never seen anyone there working with a smile on their face.",

The waitress/bartender literally dropped the drinks down on our table and kept moving. After I motioned several times that we were ready to order I watched our waitress/bartender take several to-go orders, chat it up with other patrons and never once did she come over and take our food order. We waited 30+ mins. before I just walked out my sister stayed but I refused to eat here. People had come and gone that's how long we had been waiting. NEVER AGAIN! And bet your bottom I'll make sure to leave my experience on every website I can find! Absolutely ridiculous!  I get that there were only two servers working but it wasn't terribly busy if she had enough time to do all that other stuff that she couldn't stop 2 mins to take our order.  Update: She told my sister it was a misunderstanding. She thought we weren't ordering anything. That she thought we were waiting on laundry (BULLS***!). Why would I tell you I was trying to pull the menu up on my phone if I wasn't planning on ordering? And in what establishment does a server not come back and ask if you want more to drink or want to order anything even if they aren't sure you plan to order? Try again with someone who might believe that lie!",

    "text": "I didn't actually intend to go to DD Peckers Wings.  I was looking for a different restaurant when stumbled across it.  It was on my bookmark list to try, so rather than waste more time looking for the other place, I stopped in there.  I was glad I did.  The place is pretty much a dimly lit dive bar & grille type place.  I ordered some onion rings to start with a and 10 wings with the hot sauce.  My onion rings came out pretty quick.  The rings hand made, hot out of the fryer, with just the right amount of grease.  They were thin with the batter just about falling off and very, very tasty.  They reminded me of the onion rings that my family used to get when we went out to the local fried chicken joint on Sundays as a treat.   I had a little bit of a wait after I finished the rings before my wings came out, but my waitress kept my drink filled.  The wings were a pretty good size and well coated with sauce.  They were steaming hot, temperature wise, and spicy hot flavor wise.  Usually when I order hot it is more like a medium to my palate, but these were truly hot on my spice meter.  The only negative I could find was that they were a little over cooked, but not by much so I couldn't give them 5 stars.  This place is pretty hidden in a strip mall and you'd probably drive right by if you weren't looking for it.  But my recommendation is to look for it and you won't be disappointed.  The price is also very reasonable, $7.50 for 10 wings with a wide range of sauces.  I'm definitely going back there.",

It may not look like much, but DD Peckers is a great hidden gem.  I like a lot of the sauces here, so for me it's hard to pick just one. The sampler platter is a great option if you have a few people with you. Twenty-five wings and you can do five different flavors. Hot flavors always win for me when it comes to wings. The heated versions of gold, garlic, honey, teriyaki are all great. Hoisin may sound odd for wings, but it's really delicious.   The fried pickles here are spears instead of chips. WIN. I wish everyone would vote spears when it comes to menu decision making involving fried cucumbers soaked in evil. I also like that you can do most of the starters as a half order instead of a full. I don't think the broccoli cheese balls are made in house, but they are a nice little nibble.  Parking can be kind of difficult in this shopping center. I think that may be a blessing a disguise. I mean, I need that little walk after eating that many wings and fried things dipped in ranch.",

Rough outside but just delightful inside.  As the self proclaimed \"best wings in Charlotte\" (it is stated on the menus), I have to say that this claim is not far off.  I have not tired all the wings in Charlotte so I cannot fully endorse this, but I can say they were pretty darn good.  Generous with the sauce, the wings were cooked perfectly.  I also appreciated the plethora of choices when it came to sauces.  I can give my stamp of approval on \"Hot Gold\" as it had a sweet mustard taste with some heat.  I added a side of house chips that were good, with portions above average.  Service was great as refills were constant.  Would be a great place to watch a game.  Lots of traffic in and out as a steady stream of takeout orders made their way from the kitchen.  Will I be back?  I sure hope so.  I mean try and say \"DD Peckers\" without a little smile.

I had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with the Blazing Sauce.  You would expect with blazing, it would be very hot but not the case. Never once had to wipe my brow from sweat and a good medium hot at best.  Still a nice place to go and a dive restaurant but still a good option. Just not a first choice.",

We went with the Honey hot wings and fries. They tasted just like the wings at Wing King which is a good thing. My only complaint would be the wings could've used more sauce. I will keep this place in my rotation.",

A small staff that work hard is always something to admire and return for. I've been going here for the last few years and the same people are working, the food is still delicious, and the atmosphere hasn't changed. \"You wanna go where everyone knows your name\" kind of place.",

I did finally get to try it this past weekend, man, have I been missing out!  Don't judge a book by it's cover, this place is easily hidden away in a strip mall off of Park Rd. Extension.  It really lends itself to the whole vibe and feel of the place.  The servers are super relaxed, but you are well attended to... and it really feels like a cool neighborhood regular spot.  We tried the wing sampler... that lets you get 5 different flavors with 25 wings... we thought we would have some left over but within 30min... the plate was clean and I was super happy we decided to eat wings that evening.  On a hot kick.... so we tried the Hot Garlic, Honey Hot, Hot Teriyaki, Jerk, and Lemon Pepper flavors of wings and all of them were pretty awesome.  After trying the five I would definitely get them all again, especially the honey hot.. nice mix of sweet and fire.  My favorite part was looking a the women's restroom door and seeing a sticker that says, \"I [heart] Peckers\".... sorry I just reverted to a ten year old....  All in all a great experience!

At the end of the day the wings were outstanding, beer was cold, and the atmosphere hopping. I'll add to the word of moth recommendations.",

The decoration is really cool, it has more a bar than a restaurant vibe, there is a wall full of license plates from all over the US and outside that is really nice. We started with the broccoli cheese balls, they were good but I would not order them again. It felt like they were missing some key ingredient, if they had bacon with the broccoli and cheese the combination would've been perfect.  I decided to order garlic Parmesan and Hawaiian wings, the Hawaiian is like a teriyaki sauce with pineapples. For my surprise the wings that were supposed to be one of the best in Charlotte were far from this reality.  The Hawaiian wings were burnt and so SALTY I could barely eat 2?- take in mind I was really hungry. The garlic Parmesan was better but blend, no salt at all. Maybe I had bad luck and went on a day the the seasoning got mixed or something like that but I did not like the wings at all.  My husband got a Real Deal Steak Philly with fries. The sandwich was huge and according to him it was good.  The service was great, our waitress was attentive and very courteous, the price was fair but unfortunately the wings were not good at all.",

Paid $85 for 75 wings.3 different flavors from garlic to lemon pepper to hot. Lemon pepper and garlic were so soaked and drowning  in butter you could taste virtually no flavor, in fact I could not tell the difference between the two! Hot wings were fast food or barely even Walmart caliber and devoid of flavor or wetness.  For an establishment that brags excellent wings and has virtually nothing else on the menu this is absolutely shameful and pathetic. I can't help but wonder if I may have just caught the chefs on a bad morning after...I was totally embarrassed in front of my guests.",

Tasted a little plain but wasn't all that bad. Honey BBQ was delish with dripping sauce!   Second time I got 5 hoisin honey and 5 Cajun. The hoisin honey tricked me at the beginning! They looked charred. Black. Look at the pic. Although I feel like these might have been a little overcooked on the outside, they hoisin flavor was still present and the honey drizzled over them fixed it. The Cajun was sandblasted with Cajun run. No complaints with that one. Had a really good kick to it.   Side note: I ordered chips and salsa also. Chips were cold and stale. To be fair, I ordered these at around 10pm...  Overall I'd totally come back to taste all the other flavors!!",

The wall is adorned with license plates, and an old school Frogger machine sits in one corner.    I ordered the hot wings and a side of house chips. The wings, as someone else described in a review, have a great balance of a light crunchy outside and are juicy inside.  I really wanted to try multiple flavors, but as many wings places are doing, they charge extra for multiple flavors, even in higher quantities (this makes no sense to me. - a sermon for a later time).  I did notice, though, that they do offers a sampler platter that discounts it a bit more.  The house chips are good and very salty, but were a bit limp. They have a very generous list of flavors for the wings too.  I only tried the hot, but I thought they were great.  I felt bad for the bartender/server here, as she was all by herself doing tables and running bar too.  Which, led to a little more empty glasses and a bit more waiting.  They need a separate person here for table service during the day,    Still, the star of the show is the wings here, and if you come for that, you'll not leave disappointed.  I chose here because my favorite wings in the area, East Coast Wings, was a little too far off my commute today.  Compared to them, they were very close, but ECW still edges them out a bit.",

Ok, lets let down to business, So, I read somewhere when I first moved here in July, that DD Peckers was the best wings in Charlotte, I decided to try it and man, the flavors of these wings are awesome, I've tried most of them. here is my Pros and Cons list.   Pros - Cause i always like to start with the good 1) The wings here are fresh and cooked to order, they ALWAYS come out hot, Crunchy and full of flavor. this SEEMS to be the standard around here. anything from appetizers to Wings is always hot off the press just like you like it.  2) The staff here is very friendly, and very accommodating. half this flavor, half that flavor, 2 ranch on the side, all drums. Never a problem. 3) Cool atmosphere, Im gonna upload some pictures but they have a wall with license plates from all over, A nice bar, and Plenty of TV's for your sports coverage!  Cons -  1) Location matters and it was hard to find this place the first time i went to it. Its off of Park Rd at the corner of Park Cedar DR , Between the CVS and Cook Out, BEHIND the Marathon Gas Station and Dynasty Cleaners.  2) It Looks kinda Shady, nothing on the doors and all Blacked out Windows.  3) It's kinda small, 12ish tables and some seating at the bar, but if you come on a game night or at dinner time any night, you'll wait a while.  4) Bathrooms fill up with trash rather quickly. 5) I think they hand wash they're cups, a couple of times I've got a glass with some residue on it, but they happily always bring me a clean glass. only happened twice. 6) Coke Products but no Coke Zero :(  (Personal Vendetta)  This place is AWESOME, I go at least once a week and will continue to be a regular.   Get Charlottes Best Wings at DD Peckers",

We ordered classic burger with fries, Philly cheesy steak with potato salad, and Honey Gold wings.  Cheeseburger cooked only one way, well done.  But it was delicious and juicy. French fries cooked on the well done side like I asked, crispy and delicious. We order half Philly cheesesteak and the size was perfect and big enough. So good. We got pasta salad by mistake and was told to keep it and I'm so glad they did. It was some kind of Mediterranean style with rotini pasta, pepperoncini peppers, feta cheese. So good. The potato salad was like old fashioned homemade with a slightly sweet taste. It was fantastic too. The wings were sauced perfectly and juicy and cooked the way i like em. Blue cheese on the side was creamy and chunky. Everything tasted hot and fresh. Go in, order a beer or a sweet tea and get some wings and burgers. I'm so mad I'm full, but I took leftovers home and I'm eating that shit later!!",

I love the cheese fries, mozzarella cheese sticks, and the side salad as an appetizing. The chicken wings, chicken sticks, sandwiches, and wraps are all great options. They have a ton of sauce choices to choose from. The wait staff have all been there for a while and very friendly. If you're lucky sometimes you'll even catch the owner, Justin, hanging around and he always comes by to check on everything or pitches in when things get busy.

Food - You will find your basic bar fare with a nice selection of wings including Blazing, Lemon Pepper, Hawaiian, Hot Gold, Hot Teriyaki and many more. If you're looking for a really crispy wing, then this may disappoint. But if you're looking for flavor they knock it out of the park. I have enjoyed pretty much everything I have ever ordered here. They also have good drink specials. And crushed ice!  My Staple: I usually get the buffalo chicken sandwich with the blazing sauce. It comes on a plain bun with shredded lettuce and tomato with ranch or bleu cheese on the side. (I go sans tomato)  It comes with seasoned crinkle cut fries.   Atmosphere: There are probably about 20 tables in this place so it can tend to be pretty packed if it's after work or there's a big game on TV. Decoration is pretty basic. The TV is usually tuned to sports and they have the NFL Sunday Ticket. When the games are on there is usually some fun banter between fans of opposing teams.  Service: The service isn't the speediest when busy but they are friendly and very accommodating.   Overall: A nice laid back place to grab a drink, catch a game and munch on some wings.",

I ordered a variety of Blazing, Caribbean jerk, Hawaiian, and Teriyaki. ALL of the wings were burnt. The Blazing and Caribbean Jerk were edible, however I HAD to get my money back for the Hawaiian and Teriyaki. We only tried a couple pieces of which were totally flavorless and tasted like flavorless char. While getting my money back we were given a slight attitude and agreement that the wings were \"overcooked\". Overcooked is an understatement - every other piece was COMPLETELY black and totally inedible. I don't know what was wrong today versus the other days when these great reviews were submitted. I will not be going back and will tell everyone I know to stay away. Oh and in addition to this, the Blazing wings are also horrible. Their idea of making wings hotter is adding a huge amount of black pepper to the wings. Why not just add more red pepper to the buffalo sauce? It's beyond me.",

So I get home and I'm eating them and I'm enjoying them but then I realize it was not what I ordered. Lol. By then it was too late cuz I had already eaten half.

How and why I don't understand.  Pulling into the parking lot was a surprise, wasn't at all what was expected to be listed in the top 5 best wings. Plastic silverware, drink was mediocre, server failed to tell us the wings were grilled, another surprise when our food arrived.  Bite into the wings barely warm didn't taste any flavor (order a hot spicy with a sweet twist, no flavor at all.  When server arrived asking how everything was, I had to tell her, she graciously said she would take them back and place them on the grill to warm them.  Plastic bowl returned, wings were in the exact placement when she took the bowl.  The kitchen heated the plastic bowl with celery between the wings in the MICROWAVE!!!!  Needless to say at this point I was so disappointed and ready to go.   How and why this is a restaurant in the top 5 needs to be re-evaluated and removed off the list!!!!!!",

I am a huge wing fan afficianado, because its in the flavor. I am still hooked on Louisiana Lickers from Quaker Steak & Lube (there's 1 in Pineville now. Also Whooli's is a close 2nd with their Whooli's sauce. But since it was my 1st time tonight I will give it one more shot. :)",

    "text": "Extremely decent wing-noms, and great prices. I'd had D.D's before on take-out, but was reminded of it when we needed a place to have a continuous stream of food and alcohol while watching the first U.S. World Cup game. D.D. Pecker's it was.   Service this time around was a very helpful, bouncy, sweet girl who obviously knew nothing about soccer, but would cheer and boo when the crowd did anyway, and do so while still being attentive. Definite top rating for service. The drinks were strong, which was great. Also, they held no qualms with experimenting to make my favorite drink (Grateful Dead).   The wings, as always, were delicious. I can't handle hot too well, but the Cajun is still flavorful, and I'm a fan of the Gold. My new favorite and new experience was the Hoisin Honey, which was amazing. Crunchy, blackened, and flavorful on the outside, moist and sweet/nutty tasting on the inside. If you've been on the fence about them, trust me when I say that while they're not your traditional wing flavor, they are yum.   We also ordered some onion rings, which were good, but unfortunately we had to leave the bottom layer since there was a large puddle of fry grease floating there.   Great place to watch the game, and has a great atmosphere. Yeah, perhaps a dive, but for those of you out there who are dive-lovers, this place is clean, friendly, and has great food and good drinks while you watch the game. Pull up a stool.",

    "text": "I can't believe this place got 4 stars overall!  Maybe the stars just weren't aligned when I went.  My night started with me wanting to find a good wings place nearby that was open past 10 PM. I was also interested in my church buddys coming here on Tuesday nights when they have .59 wings because we were looking for a closer place to South Charlotte.  DDs was nearby and open, so I thought I'd check it out due to the great reviews.  I walked in and no server said a word to me.  It was pretty busy, so, I sat myself.   No biggie.  After five minutes of no one saying anything, I moved to the bar since there was someone working that area.  Again, no one said anything to me for about 5 minutes.  I finally got a hello and ordered a drink.  After this, I waited 15 minutes for the bartender to take my food order despite the fact that my menu was closed and she passed by many times.  Finally, she took my order, and after bringing it to me, I didn't hear a peep for almost an hour when I finally had to ask for my check to leave.  No refills, no \"how is everything.\"  I can't say I've EVERY experienced that at any restaurant no matter how busy.  To top it all off, the guy announcing trivia swore like a pirate including calling some girls \"b*tches\" which apparently they didn't find offensive.  I find it ironic they would have a sign out front that says \"A Fun Neighborhood Joint.\"  I guess the name of the business should have given it away.  It sounds like a male strip club or something!  Oh and I would rate the sandwich a 4 out of 10.  Nothing special.  Never again will I return...",

    "text": "This is one of the best places to get wings in Charlotte. I've been wanting to check it out for a while now, but just now got around to it. Wing King Cafe is also frequently mentioned as the best wings in Charlotte. It's hard for me to say which is better since it's been a few years since I've been to Wing King Cafe, but both have amazing wings.   We got the 25 wing sampler with Ginger, Hot Gold, Hot Ranch, Hot Fajita, Garlic Parmesan. All of the flavors were really good and the hot flavors weren't too spicy (to someone who doesn't like really spicy food). The Hot Fajita was definitely the hottest, but was still good to me. It had a strong lime flavor and was my husband's favorite (he loves spicy food). We both agreed the Ginger was the weakest of the flavors we got - it had a teriyaki/ginger seasoning, but didn't have much flavor at all. The charred flavor was good, but I was hoping for a much stronger ginger flavor. The Hot Ranch was a Buffalo Ranch and was pretty good. The Hot Gold was a mustard BBQ with a little kick and the Garlic Parmesan was pretty solid. Overall, there's a ton of options to choose from and I would expect everyone to be able to find something they like.   The service is incredibly fast and friendly. They were happy to provide explanations and recommendations.   We will definitely be coming back next time we want some wings!",

    "text": "I've always really liked DD Peckers and we've been going there since I was young. The other day I went and it was a lil disappointing.... the menu doesn't have a lot on it for anyone not wanting wings, like my bf, years ago there was much more that they did. I love their wings and I love the BC dressing, but .95 cents for a BC is crazy.  My boyfriend order the bacon cheeseburger and they forgot the bacon... so sitting there waiting for his bacon... him telling me to eat my wings so they don't get cold, and his is sitting getting cold. How do u mess up a bacon cheeseburger! Especially since we were the only table in the place and it was right after they opened.... I thought the girl would take off the bacon at least since we had to wait too long for it, and shouldn't have had to at all...... I asked for 2 BCs to go that she brought out and sat down and said there 95 cents each so I said no, she said she'd do 2 for $1, but after her messing up the burger or the kitchen, I would expected her to give them to us considering....  we won't return.  There's wild wing downtown and at arsley, and wing king is on south Tryon and is amazing and been there forever! There are so many wing places out there, this place should go the extra mile, not upcharge so bad, and be consistent making sure everything comes out of the kitchen correctly!!!!! There's no harm in waiting longer for things to come out so they come out correctly and hot.  Definitely was a disappointment to show my BF this place I've loved as a child that looks like it's going down the tubes.... literally we were the only table, and got there at 11:05am and they open at 11.   No excuses!!! Did nothing to assure that we would come back either.",

We weren't in a rush but it took them about 20 mins to get us our wings and chicken on a stick.   I will be grabbing another order today (to go). I hope I get some juicy big and tasty wings.",

Parking is tight and you may have to walk a bit to get to the place from the parking lot ... as the place apparently keeps the parking lot packed!   On to the food...  My order of 10 wings came out record fast ... within 10 minutes ! Not sure if it was the kitchen was ready for the football crowd or what but it was fast !   I tried 2 flavors, mild and Gold wings based on the recommendation of the waitress.  The wings were off the hook delicious!   Tender and flavorful- I have to say the honey were so good and the mild had just enough kick to cause my lips to tingle but not so hot that I ran for water.  Both were Just delicious! Both sets of 5 were very wet . Covered in sauce - so be prepared to use a roll of paper towels...    So if you're looking for good wings .., There here for sure !  Two thumbs way up !",

Giving them 4 stars only because the service was great considering it was only two ladies working the floor and bar area on football Sunday. The wings are not the best in Charlotte but they were pretty good. I would caution lemon pepper lovers, as they are not a dry rub like most. They are drenched in teriyaki so you taste mainly that flavor. The menu does not mention that so I suggest they add that as a notation to the menu. Also, the side salad was $3.95, probably should be $2.50 considering how small the salad was. Overall pretty good with great service.",

The staff was friendly, service was quick, and the prices decent.  I only ordered wings to go:  Honey Gold (too sweet for my liking) and Cajun spice (which is better when dipped in the Honey Gold sauce).  I appreciate that the wings were sized properly--not some wimpy pigeon wings, nor the pumped full of factory steroids size, either.  About what a normal chicken grows when its raised for consumption by regular folk.  Would I return?  Yes, if I lived nearby.  With so many decent wing places nearer my neighborhood, however, its probably a one-off for me.  PS:  The Ron Jeremy pic behind the bar is too funny!",

I am in SHOCK someone would call these the best wings in Charlotte. save your money and go somewhere else.",

We ordered the fried pickle spears and house made chips as an appetizer, which were both good, not great. The wings were what we came for ,and we were not to be disappointed. Got 3 different flavors of wings. Mild are like a traditional Buffalo wing, hot ranch and hot honey BBQ. The hot ranch was outstanding, a crunchy, spicy, ranch flavor, really good! The mild wing was also excellent. The hot honey BBQ was good, not great.  Definitely coming back again and would recommend this place to any wing lover.",

For some reason, people bring their kids to this place even though it's a bar so it's usually really noisy. The food is actually really good. The wings are delicious and flavorful as are the buffalo chicken wraps and the onion rings. They are crispy, battered and greasy just like onion rings should be. Their ranch tastes homemade and is very good. Note that this is the kind of place where the bartenders/waitresses know most folks and when we were there, we happened to be sitting in someone's \"regular\" booth and the group of dads were playing fantasy football with their kids (???) so we felt the need to split so the gang could sit together. So, it is a neighborhood dive bar, lots of noisy kids, good food. Service is okay at best.",

Peckers, and if you don't, then you will quickly learn the value of such a wonderful place.   This hole in the wall is a welcoming sort of place, despite it's surroundings. And by welcoming, I mean, roll-your-sleeves-up-grab-a-cold-one kind of welcoming. It is a hive for sports fans, trivia nerds, and wing aficionados alike.   Three flavors to go for- Blazing (if you are a spice fanatic), hot gold, and honey hot. It is so awesome to eat a non-Texas Pete soaked wing in a world full of them. They obviously make their own buffalo sauce, or if they don't, they stole nectar from the gods. Bangin' and I mean BANGIN flavors.  Ordered a side of fries, which were crispy and seasoned. Blue cheese is made in house, and it's thick and chunky and wonderful...also a hard feat to come by.   Just simply do yourself a favor and go. Don't dress up, don't use a fork and knife, you will get strange looks from people like me if you do! ;-)",

    "text": "We stopped here while in Charlotte after finding decent reviews for this place on Yelp.  I LOVE wings, and am always excited to try new places, especially one that offers so many flavors.  We ordered the 25 sampler wings, consisting of Mild, Hot Garlic, Hot BBQ, Cajun and Hot Gold. Somehow I didn't get the Hot Garlic and ended up with more Hot Gold. The Cajun was a dry rub and I liked it. The Hot Gold was a southern style BBQ which I didn't really care for. If you like BBQ sauce on your wings, try it. I don't....     My daughter got the Hot Garlic and she said they were okay. It looked like they dumped way too much actual minced garlic on top of them.  My daughter had the lemonade. She said she doesn't know what sewer water tastes like, but she was pretty sure this was it. The sodas were very seltzery.  Service was a little slow, but it was Saturday during dinner, and it was packed.  We all ended up with stomach pains that night, especially my wife who was up all night. I thought it to be a fluke, until I read other reviews below mentioning stomach pain.  I'm not sure if it was too much seltzer from the sodas or what, but it was enough that my wife won't let us go back.  I don't like judging places on one visit, and with the crowds, I'm assuming people getting sick isn't the norm. Give it a try. The wings are huge and if you live locally, I'm sure you'll end up finding your favorite sauce.  Good Luck!",

    "text": "Wings are not the best Charlotte has to offer, neither is service. There was 1 waitress on a Friday night, who was super \"rushy\" with us and took about 6-7 mins in between each visit coming to our table. When she came over, she instantly pushed the roll of napkins, salt and pepper shaker to the middle of the table so she could put down her paper to take out order, knocking over the pepper shaker. Once she noticed pepper spilled all over the table, she wiped it off, onto my friends lap that had on white pants, and blamed my other friend for knocking it over smh. It took her about 2 times coming over before we placed drink orders 3 more times coming over before taking our actual food order, again, too rushy and a lack of patience.   Once our food came out, which didn't take long, all of us ordered extra crispy wings, and none were crispy. I had 1-2 out of 10 that were crispy, and when she came around to see how things were, we'd literally just began eating. After about 10mins, my friend just gave up and was tired of picking over her wings, trying to find one that was right. I was ok with mine, and stated I'd just put the remaining ones in the oven later. When we notified the waitress, my friend had 15 and again, all were soft and flimsy. The waitress asked her what she wanted to do about it, my friend asked could they make the remaining over. She said \"well you've ate about all of them, so we can just make them over, Ive been over here a couple of times so you should have been said something...\" so my friend went said well you asked what I wanted done. Then the waitress proceeded to say \"I've been here/serving for 18 yrs and you have to speak up when something is wrong\" So we are like \"ok we had to eat a few to know they were not cooked to our desired liking...as we'd asked!!!! She kept going on and on, so my friend just sat their and got quiet. Then my friend said \"you know what, I don't want them remade, it's ok. So the waitress THEN assumed and said \"you want me to pay huh, I'll just pay for it\" and then she looked at me and said \"who else wants their meal paid for tonight???\" TOTALLY rude and almost discriminatory. So I said well do you want to pay because you can!!!! She said well no, and She just ended up walking to another table, and it appeared she was talking to them about the situation. It took her about 15 mins to even come back over, for us to ask for our check and boxes. We paid and she tried to reexplain herself for earlier, saying if there is a problem just say something early on. My friend told her she was just trying to give them an actual chance before complaining. She only charged two of us. We gave her our payments and whoever is responsible for cashing out, actually ran my card twice for myself and the other guest tab! Our waitress was then super frustrated started to get teary eyed and I just told her it was fine, I could get the cash back from the other person. She did at least try to fix that and was apologetic. Needless to say, we still left a good tip and just left. I'm sure I'll never return!",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place forever, since they are always listed in the Best Wings of CLT category...........Clearly I am in the minority, with a really REALLY bad visit.   Saturday at 2:30 pm, the place was full, standing room only.   We got a table after 15 mins or so.    Off the bat, dirty table, no hand soap in either restroom, men's bathroom was filthy - as in a whole number level of nastiness.  I get it, it was slammed, the gals working were hustling and I take nothing away from the service, it was awesome.    The problem was, myself, my wife and I all had bad stomach cramps and diarrhea, its 24 hours later and we still do not feel normal.   We ordered 25 wing combo with Cajun, Blazing, Mild, Teriyaki and Honey Hoisin.  For those of you that like large meaty wings, this place is not for you.   All wings were on the small to medium size, which I prefer.   The Cajun were decent, the Blazing had zero heat - in fact, we cold not figure out which is brazing and which is mild, the Teriyaki had zero flavor - almost like the Teriyaki sauce ran off on the platter,  SURPRISE - the burnt looking honey hoisin were pretty damn tasty.   They are not burnt, they just look burnt.    We ordered onion rings.  They were excellent.   The fried mushrooms were terrible,  over-breaded and way over-cooked.   My wife ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich which she said was nothing special.  As a family we shared the onion rings and mushrooms, something must have been going on.  I am not sure what the issue was.   Obviously, based on the Yelp love and excellent reviews, we clearly had an \"aw shit\" experience, we get it, it happens, but it does totally suck.",

My mom ordered the teriyaki wings and they came out so burnt and black they'd probably turn to dust if you poked them. Even the waitress couldn't believe they were brought to the table like that. I tried to give this place another try this week and ordered the chicken philly wrap...honestly it was pretty dry and I couldn't tell if I was actually eating chicken or not. Disappointing and probably won't be back. On a positive note, the homemade chips and the mozzarella sticks are pretty yummy. So it's a hit or miss with what you order.",

We had a friend over from Buffalo we've told about DDP's so many times, and were mortified at the boxes we opened. The wings were comical Smurf size. The Hoisin looked like fossilized charcoal with sesame seeds. Of the 35 wings we ordered nearly half were borderline inedible. In fairness, the tenders were great as always.",

The hubby ordered 5 honey hot and 5 hot. He tried all 4 and the hot was his favorite. The lemon pepper was good but not a dry rub. The wings were medium- to medium small size. The garlic parm were super mediocre. They were wet and had Parmesan and minced garlic just dumped on them and didn't have any flavor. We're just team Lebowskis wings.",

Should have a 2x ($) it's a little pricey for what they put out, first Impression was not expected since I've been scoping this place for a while now.  I got wings and beer. The wings were cooked fine but wow they need to work on sauces lol Caribbean was wayyy too salty, no sage or sweetness added, just repulsive. The hot garlic was a little better with fresh garlic bits but the hot sauce was thin and watered down. So it was basically plain fried chicken wings with bits of garlic pieces.  Very relaxed environment, I guess they don't have anything exciting or new going on there. I wish them good luck. My culinary degree and 10 years of restaurant experience says they need a little work in the kitchen. They might put some good stuff out sometimes but very inconsistent. Also 27 mins for wings is obsurd for that order. Especially with 4 tables lol the bartender did a great job with tending and waiting tables",

I ordered 12 Hot Gold and by the time I realized I should have taken a picture for this review, they were gone.   I ordered 5 more of the Hot Ranch! (See pic).   BOTH ARE AWESOME!

It's a friendly little spot that offers a lot of different flavors of your favorite wings.  We tried the 5 flavor sampler and thought the Honey Hot and the Hot Gold flavors were the best. The others flavors were tasty, but slightly on the salty side.    They don't offer a special \"wing night\" like other similar establishments, but they appear to be doing fine without that type of promotion (although it would be nice if they did offer it).  Another thing they didn't offer were some wet naps!  Overall, it was a good experience and I would return just to try out their other flavors.",

It's a hole in the wall in a strip mall but they know how to make some fine wings and that's why the place is always busy.  By far their best sauce is the Hot Gold.  Try your wings extra crispy with this warmy tangy sauce and some blu cheese to dip them in and you can't go wrong.  Very affordable as well.  A basket of seasoned fries will run you about $3 and their side salads are always fresh and tasty!    The wings are so good I almost hate to review this place as I don't want it to become too popular!  Do yourself and your taste buds a favor and stop in and try the Hot Gold.  The Hot Ranch isn't too shabby either!",

    "text": "BEST WINGS EVER!!!  We eat here almost once a week and if we skip a couple weeks we make it up by going 4 days in a row. I love the hot honey bbq and the garlic, my bf usually gets the hot gold, but we've had almost all the flavors and you really can't go wrong. We've also ate our way through their appetizer list and can't complain about any of them, good and greasy and the prefect starter to the main meal. Surprisingly their Veggie burger is amazing, like one of the best I've ever had.  Their daily domestic drink specials are on point and great for washing down the wings. Buy one of their koozies and you'll be set!  All the ladies who work are are awesome. They each have their own thing going and bring something unique to their service. It's not fake sugar coated generic niceties and that's what makes them awesome. They're genuine and that's appreciated.   This place can get packed esp during Carolina games and it may not be the hippest, classiest or shinest place but it is hands down my favorite wings/grab some beers place to go in Charlotte.",

Come as you are, park in the raggedy parking lot. Tiny place that is well worn but clean.  Get a bottle of Miller Lite or Ultra and get some wings to share try the Gold, they are excellent.  I'm not saying this is the place to bring out of town friends but there is a reason this it has great reviews.  So the next time you don't feel like putting make up on or doing your hair, give this place a try.",

You don't have to ask for crispy they come out with the slight crisp and a solid amount of sauce.  Hot Gold - Best.  Drop the microphone.  I am here at 9:00 on a Friday and this place has been slammed for hours.  The difference maker vs. other solid wing places is that the staff and cooks have been here for years and years.  Great service too..",

Stuck between other small shops and pubs, you'll want to find your way in, sooner rather than later, to try out this pub grub.   The wings. Man. Just the plain old mild are where it's at. Big wings with tons of sauce. The Hot Gold are like Carolina Mustard BBQ meets awesome and had a lovechild. Delicious.   The cheese fries are a little lackluster. Great fries. Seasoned well and crinkle cut. The cheese is just shredded cheese thrown on top. Not my favorite but does well in a pinch.   The fried pickles are dank. Huge spears and generously breaded. Go for a little ranch or bleu dipping action and you're set.   The inside is so quaint. Easy to feel right at home at the bar, one of the high-tops or a booth. Sink into the culture a bit more and come in for trivia or watch the game. Great people run this place and the product and atmosphere shine that fact forth gloriously.   Thanks, DD Peckers. You've got my vote!",

It reminds of a lot of the places I would go for wings back in WNY. My order is always ready when I arrive (about 15min) no matter how busy they are.   I usually order the traditional hot wings. These pack a little heat behind them! Recently, upon recommendation from one of the waitresses I ordered from, I've tried the Hot Gold... they're the reason I'm sitting down to write this review! It takes a lot to convert this former Western New Yorker wing snob to something other a regular hot wing!",

Perfect example of a dive bar if I have ever seen one. Staff was all super nice, they all appeared to enjoy working there, family like atmosphere, lots of regulars. Ordered the fried pickles, onion rings and the hot ranch wings.  Had the fried pickles before, they do the spears, looooove the spears.. they were good, crunchy, salty right amount of breading. The onion rings, they were sad.. greasy, mushy... a few were crunchy and those were tasty but most were too greasy/mushy to eat. The hot ranch wings.. OMG... I woke up this morning wanting them for breakfast. The wings themselves were super crispy... even with the sauce.. the hot ranch was not hot by my standards but had really good flavor.. BF has eaten there many times, never tired and he was said he had been missing out. I will be eating here again in another week or so for sure.",

Just an age warning - the trivia is raunchy and oh so fun.  Don't bring your kids.  Come to get your drink on, relax and have a good laugh with Justin on the mic.  This place is a blast.

To me, the sides are nothing special, either.   The wings are the star for good reason--they're a good size, slightly crispy, generously sauced, and the price point is great. They have a huge variety of sauces, and I don't think you can go wrong with any of them, but my favorite is Hot.   The space is relatively small and the parking lot is kind of awkward, so if you're thinking of catching a game here make sure to arrive early. D.D. Peckers also does a great job with carry out if that's more your style.",

At best, the wings are decent, and a bit overpriced. Teriyaki and Gold are good. Cajun, Hoisin, Hot... very much over salted. In fact, most of the wings here are too salty. But the piece de resistance? It's the customer service - namely, the guy who answers the phone. He's horrid. I know, it's the weekend, and you're busy. I don't expect small talk, or even a smile. Heck, I don't even mind curtness. But, I draw the line at snotty sarcasm. But hey... if snotty sarcasm whilst taking your order is your thing? Then DD Peckers is your spot. However, there are too many other great places for wings (I'm looking at you, Moosehead Grille)! Fool me once, shame on you and all that.....",

But a half order is only 3 pieces. Also had a half order of the spicy onion rings. A good amount of thinly sliced onions but not very, if any, spice. The wings were large and meat with a really good sauce and the black and blue burger was outstanding. I also had the house made chips instead of the fries. Also very good. The fries looked like normal frozen ones. Most definitely a return visit is in order. And the service was also first rate. Just wish there was at least 1 or 2 more pickles in the order.",

My flight got in late and DD Peckers was one of the only places open after 10PM that wasn't closing in the next 30 minutes.  I hate to admit it, but I was not expecting much when I rolled up to this spot. If anything, I was expecting cheap beer and decent wings.  The wings were described as jumbo, and that an order of 10 is usually a good meal. I got 10 wings and a half order of the chili cheese fries.   The chili on the fries was really good. It was chili with beans, which I prefer, but I know it's not everyone's favorite. The fries were pretty tasty with tons of cheese and chili. Definitely eat them with a fork.  The wings were the star, for sure. They were not breaded and they were very crispy, without being over cooked. The sauces were spicy and tangy (I forgot which two flavors I tried, but they were very good). I remember one of the sauces was peppery instead of tasting like tabasco. I really enjoyed that one. It was definitely worth it.  If I'm ever back in town, I'd go back for sure.",
