Great drink selections and the food is pretty strong.  I had the Steak French Dip and it was delicious!  The midweek night my wife and I visited the place was moderately busy and the wait staff was highly attentive.  If your looking for a casual, vibrant relaxing stop for you and your partner look no further than the Rusty B! Drinks and food will no disappoint!",

    "text": "In town on business; Sunday night and staying nearby. Great atmosphere, lots of tv's and good variety on menu. Service was very good. Anthony was server. Couldn't decide what to eat based on reviews. Really wanted wings but no reviews on them so was leery to order them. Started with spinach dip due to good reviews. Thumbs down. Didn't like. I think it was the cheese sauce. Just wasn't working for me.   Ordered wings \"crispy and plain\", with a side of sweet chili. Delicious!!! Loved them! Just the right amount of sweet with a little kick. Asked to try sriracha sauce for a little more heat but didn't love it. Didn't seem any hotter than sweet chili.   Anthony asked if I liked spin dip and since I didn't, he removed it from my bill. I said he didn't have to, but he insisted. That was very cool of him.   Wanted to give this place a 3 star so bad due to the OBNOXIOUS child sitting at the table next to me, but that's not the restaurant's fault. It nearly ruined my dinner. Luckily had earbuds (dined alone) to help drown the kid out. May have left if I had been dining with other people. Pretty confident you'd hear that kid anywhere you were sitting.   Overall, a good experience and certainly worth the 4 stars I gave it.  Would have been much better without the whiny child. I sat in bar area so the family with young children was not expected. Wish they'd invested in a babysitter instead of the Ralph Lauren Polo shirts the children were wearing. Will come back again.",

    "text": "Coming from a girl who's dating a man from Ohio, he was extremely excited and looking forward to the day that Rusty Bucket finally opened here so he can have a good \"go to\" place down here. We came into this location for the first time tonight and have no complaints. We were promptly greeted and seated at our table and our waitress was just the sweetest young lady. She is already knowledgable about the menu and drinks and remained extremely attentive during the entire meal. I ordered the gluten free mahi mahi tacos (absolutely a + that they have a  gluten free menu to choose from) and my boyfriend had the rusty bucket burger which he enjoyed and he's a picky burger guy. We even splurged on the fried pickles (I know, I know, not gluten free) Which were.... Amazing. \"You don't get fried pickles like this down here\" : these are the words that I have heard from my boyfriend every time he's talked about this place. And he's right! They are chunky spears fried in a crunchy and delicious breading that leaves the pickle still crisp after being fried, not soggy. Definitely will remain my guilty pleasure for a long time to come. All of the food was fresh, well cooked, and presented acceptably. Of course you have a ton of beer selections but with an unfortunate lack of lagers or lighter beers, but they do have creative cocktails. I had the gin drink on special tonight (they have cocktail specials daily) and it was tasty. All of the waiters took turns walking the dining room refilling waters, etc. at all tables, not just theirs. Everyone had a smile on their face, never rushed you, and were very respectful but still have that look of \"this is all new\" in their eyes, but that's okay, it is new! Overall enjoyed it.  Good place to have in town and it will be our regular go to. It is a tavern, so expect people and TV's and crowds, but it is far better than any other chain tavern around. This isn't a top of the line $$$$ dining experience so it shouldn't be judged as one. Plus, well, I support all things Ohio these days and I'm happy it's brought a piece of home to my boyfriend! Give it a try!",

Son had the pepperoni pizza with thin crust - was nervous about pizza from a chain, but they make their own crust...came away very satisfied and will be back.

A girlfriend and I went on a Tuesday after work, and when we got there at 5:45, the bar area was already half full. (As another reviewer noted, I almost went in the wrong door. Oops.) It took awhile for the bartender to acknowledge me even though there seemed to be a few staff people hanging out at the bar not doing anything, but that was the only blip in good service.  The bar was pretty cozy and had multiple TVs (there was even a TV in the bathroom!) so you could watch the game. I think there may have even been USB outlets for phone charging at each bar seat, but we didn't bend over far enough to completely confirm.  The wine, draft, and tap lists were solid, and there is a different drink special every night. For dinner, I got a salad and my girlfriend got chicken fingers and fries; hers came wayyyy before mine, which was odd, and the bartender finally offered to check on it. My salad was fine, and my friend's chicken fingers looked like real chicken fingers.  Overall, this appears to be a solid addition to the neighborhood, and I'm looking forward to trying it again after they've gotten into a groove.",

She was also assisting with a large party and we never felt like we were left out because of that. Lisa was personable and very helpful with making selections for our table. We had a variety of items including pizza, fish and chips, the Italian torpedo(oh my), salmon, buffalo chicken and a cheesesteak. All of the food was amazing!!!!

Based upon multiple visits:  Staff is a total hit or miss, while it felt like, if my bar attendant J. can do any less for me I was sure she would & I was 1 out 4 ppl in the entire area!!- her bar mate on the other hand was very attentive, offered refills, mentioned happy hr specials to patron. I, on the other hand, got my mechanically performed service- get them in & out style. Bar mate eventually took over. Typical American bar menu, but If you suffer from blood pressure, not the place for you! Near everything is overly salted. Not yet impressed with a particular dish.",

He's picky about bloody Marys, trust me. They come in three options for spiciness. My drink was citrusy and just enough sweet. We had the bucket of shrimp and they were firm and fresh and crisp. I find that a lot of shrimp are iodiny, not these. They came with cocktail sauce and a remoulade. So good. I ordered the taco salad and it can feed three people. That bitch was huge! It had shredded lettuce with a creamy cilantro dressing and it came on a flat fried tortilla with ground beef, melted cheddar and tomatoes and jalapenos. It was so good and I was mad I couldn't finish it. Overall, we really liked it. We will be back for a burger next time and some cinnamon dessert thing that looked so good. My Bucket was full when I left, fill yours here!!",

Prices might be a tad higher than usual for things like a burger or chicken sandwich (maybe $1 above), but it's always good food. Drink prices are average and fair with some notable specials throughout the week. Can't go wrong with a burger or any of the sandwiches really.   I almost hate letting the secret out, but this is my new go-to brunch spot if other places like Tupelo or Toast are too crowded. Surprisingly, Rusty Bucket has a good brunch menu. Try the short rib hash, it's really good. Chicken and waffles are really tasty as well. There's not a huge selection, but the dishes available are done well. REALLY wish they had a better mimosa deal during the weekend for brunch.  I was on the fence about 3 or 4 stars, but the service is ALWAYS exceptional and friendly, so taking that into consideration pushes it up to 4 stars for me.",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to the South Park area of Charlotte and to Rusty Bucket Restaurant and Tavern. What a unique name for a restaurant. This casual neighborhood restaurant offers all of the normal tavern type foods, like burgers, sandwiches and wings, but also some not so typical, like sirloin, pasta, and chicken parmesan.  Dora here. With their robust menu, Rusty Bucket has a little something for everyone. In case you're like us and not a huge fan of brunch, they also offer their regular menu on the weekends, one aspect we really appreciated! I really liked the cozy, casual vibes of this place, and no fretting over parking, either. There's a free parking garage practically right next door. Bonus!   For our appetizer, we chose the Warm Cinnamon Sugar Donut Holes with a caramel dipping sauce. These donut holes were great, light and had great favor although not particularly sweet. I was not a fan of the dipping sauce, but if you rolled them around in a plate of sugar, the sweetness level was perfect. Dora here. Cinnamon heaven! The doughnut holes were light and airy, and I was a bit relieved that Ernie didn't care for the buttery warm sauce because that left more for me! lol. Oh. My. Yum!   I chose the Breakfast Burrito from the Brunch menu. Scrambled eggs, sausage, peppers and onions, pepper jack and cheddar cheese wrapped in a tortilla then topped with ranchero sauce and sour cream and served with red skin breakfast potatoes. Now I have had breakfast burritos all over the world but I have to say this one was in the top three of the best I have ever had. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the sausage not spicy, the shell soft, and the ranchero sauce added just enough heat to finish off this dish. I would definitely order this burrito again.  Dora here. What can I say about the Codwich? Oh my word, y'all! The picture doesn't even do it justice. I could hardly get that giant chunk of cod in my mouth. lol. Huge. Meaty. Delicious! Oh yeah, I would order this again. My iced tea glass never ran dry, always a plus, and service was attentive and friendly. Rusty Bucket definitely made it on our repeat list!  What about you? Do you get all excited about brunch? What's your favorite brunch dish? Stop by Fiction Faith & Foodies, we'd love to know! ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2nHzEV9&s=0a1e2d5067cef2f83af7de56eb7ecc7b1791e3b7f0f636e25906e81cd3e7c2aa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2nHzEV9</a>",

Had 730 reservations, when we arrived there was about 3 people hovering around the hostess station and it was apparent there was some sort of confusion in the general sense of things, none the less we were seated promptly...After 14 minutes of waiting and seeing the table seated next to us be greeted and served water immediately up arrival, my wife and I decided to leave.  As we left I very nicely let the hostess know that our table was available should they need to seat a party there she asked why and I said since we weren't given water and someone chose to serve the table seated ten minutes after us first that we decided to leave, she looked at me and said \"that wasn't even your server\", honestly I wasn't upset until she said that, I was astonished it was comically bad ha ha, I would have even returned to try as no one was rude, the vibe was good, the space seemed cleaned, but that one comment did it for me.  Somehow it was our fault they didn't serve us?  Still trying to figure out what her point of saying that was, oh well, they never had my business before so they won't miss it, no harm no foul, but still a shame.",

Possibly my favorite buffalo chicken sandwich. Panko breading, blue cheese crumbles, lettuce, tomato, and a [delicious] toasted sesame seed bun.  People have complained about the service but there's so much more that overshadows it. Although I'd agree the service doesn't match the best in town, it's certainly still adequate.  Other reasons this place gets 5 stars, 1) good prices, especially for the neighborhood, 2) great tv sizes/placement, etc. which you would hope for at a tavern, 3) awesome patio with a good amount of people watching (I'm a fan), 4) friendly staff and 5) very nicely built, laid out and maintained.

But they do make their own Sour Mix, Bloody Mary Mix and simple syrup. Maybe the Pine Fin???  Once inside though, any preconceived notions of this Tavern/Sports Bar will be gone. The decor is really nice - lots of dark burly, manly wood and a copper footrest at the bar. A couple of enormous flat screen TVs. Tons of seating indoors and out.  We came here for a little day drinking (it's a real hobby - look it up).  There's plenty on tap and in bottle, including seasonal brews from Birdsong and Triple C.  My friends ordered a bottle of Piper Sonoma knowing that it wasn't cold yet. The bartender worked her magic, with a huge tub of ice, some salt and about 10-15 minutes.  So a short visit - didn't get to try their food yet (blame it on Cripsy Bahn Mi-hehe) - even though appetizers and pizzas are are half price weekday afternoons (3-6 PM). There's always next time.  Good place to get a drink by Southpark!",

    "text": "Ok, so here is the skinny....in a quick review.  I've been twice.  This place is my back up when all the other Southpark restaurants are on 1.5 and 2 hour wait times.   It's a step up from a sports bar as far as the decor goes.  Plenty of TVs to entertain you while your friends are on their phones doing the FB and Instagram thing.    Food is hit or miss.  The 2 times I've been:  Meatloaf was decent and the dinner salad was decent.  The Spinach Queso was really really good. The Bacon Cheeseburger was just alright.  I wasn't crazy about having relish on my burger....but I tolerated it.  My friend got the Macaroni and Cheese Entree.....it was more like Macaroni Soup.  He said it wasn't all that great but he could deal with it.  Service has always been nice, friendly, and prompt.  I question if this place will be here very long.   It's not that great but it's not awful either.    Give it a whirl.  It's either hit or miss really.  Hope you hit it.",

    "text": "We've visited the Rusty Bucket twice so far.  The first time was in December for a date night.  The food was fantastic.  I debated between a sandwich or the mac and cheese made with beer cheese.  Then I found a burger (actually two!) that had beer cheese on top of them.  I went with the Green Chili burger, which actually has a beer cheese on it, along with spicy jalapenos.  It was delicious, as were the accompanying seasoned fries.  It was a Friday night, which was martini night, so I tried the grapefruity one that our server recommended that had fruit-infused vodka.  Yum at a great deal.  The only downside about that visit was that it was the first real cold spell of the season (like 20-something degrees out), and we were seated underneath a vent that every 10 minutes or so would blast freezing cold air on us.  We kept our jackets on the entire night, which you really shouldn't have to do.  Plus, it just cooled down our hot food.  Dear restaurants: turn off the A/C in the winter.  Thank you.  Our 2nd visit was a couple weeks ago.  My parents were in town visiting, so six of us went to the Rusty Bucket on a Saturday night.  When we arrived, we were informed it would be a 20-35 minute wait.  Ok.  That wasn't too bad, considering it was a Saturday night and the fact that they don't take reservations.  That 20-35 minute wait turned into a 60 minute wait.  Granted, it's not the restaurant's fault if people were watching sports on the big TVs around the restaurant and wouldn't leave their tables.  Well, maybe it partially is.  Around the 30-minute mark and beyond, we were told intermittently that our table would be ready very soon.  At around the 45 minute mark, they told us it would be just one more minute, and even had menus in hand.  I'm not sure what happened, but that dragged out until 60 minutes from the time we arrived, we were finally seated.  Everyone else who had been waiting for a table had long been seated, even parties bigger than us.  The manager told us that we'd be well taken care of and he'd buy us apps.  That was nice, of course, and the action that he should have done (although drinks may have been appropriate as well in this case).  Unfortunately, once we were finally seated, the follow up on those promises wasn't that great.  After our initial contact with our server who was all bright and bubbly, we rarely saw her again.  She never came by for drink refills, she never came by to check on our meals, and it took forever to get our check.  When we finally DID get the check, it had the price of the \"free\" apps on it!  Worse, the manager NEVER came by to check on us.  Seriously?  If I was the MOD on duty that night, I would have been kissing our asses to make sure we had a fantastic time.  I don't think a little attention after that fiasco is asking too much.  IT'S YOUR JOB.  I guess we were too nice and should have been total assholes instead.  Anyway, the food was good again and at least we weren't seated in the A/C zone on another brisk night, but the service and follow through was quite shitty.  Owning a dining establishment isn't just about the food and atmosphere, it's about providing quality customer service if you want repeat visitors.  I think some people need a refresher course or to find another field of work.",

Not so great - back of the menu - drink menu is not accurate. They drop the menus and don't say anything about modifications or seasonal options. After deciding, and waiting, we found out that an entire sections of beer was \"out.\" So it's kind of misleading to list a type of beer and list of options under that type, that you don't actually sell. Waitress was great at sharing about the special (what they are pushing, and want you to buy), but failed to mention much else. After failing at any beer options in the type we like, I asked about seasonals. She then took ~5-7 mins to bring that menu. After us taking our time and picking, she took the order and came back another 5 later to say that was \"out.\" She then checked and said she could sub a NoDa beer instead. Ok, what? We wanted to get something different-your menu seems diverse for regions and options. I then found out it was $7 for a NoDa beer. Ya, no thanks, I can go there and pay $5. I didn't appreciate a sub option for a very unique, awesome beer as a NoDa option. I love them, but can get them all over-including their brewery-in Charlotte!   My recommendation - go across the street to Dogwood or Corkbuzz. They are both fantastic.   The food is all bar food, I didn't try it, it may be delicious, but the drink thing was just very off putting.",

I've never met a philly cheese steak I didn't like until I came here. The meat (prime rib) was way too tender. A philly should have a bite to it. The sandwich was served open-faced with an obnoxious amount of cheese. It was way too much to close and eat as a sandwich.  Last time I ordered the meat loaf and it, too, was disappointing.   If you're going to eat here, I would recommend just ordering a burger. Everyone always seems to be happy with the burgers, and there are plenty of options on tap for beer.",

    "text": "Now I know why they call it the Rusty Bucket, because you'll need a tetanus shot after eating there.  After arriving for our reservation at 1:30 and having asked for a later reservation, and being told there was no availability, we arrived to a nearly vacant restaurant with the hostess literally telling a customer over the phone that there was no wait or reservation required \"just come on in there's plenty of room\".  We were then seated at table on an empty patio, we were told we had to move because that table was \"reserved\" (no reserve sign/empty patio).  Granted after having settled in with two children, we relocated to a table directly next to it, where we proceeded to receive kids drinks with no straws, and had to go in and get them ourselves.  The server at this point was nice, however after asking to speak to the manager about the table incident, stating repeatedly to our server that it had nothing to do with poor service, she became apathetic and aggravated, as if we were inconveniencing her.  Our food was dropped off promptly, however all dishes were luke warm (cold and hot alike) which is quite an astonishing accomplishment if you think about it.  In any case, we had to go in and get napkins, to go boxes and then spoke to the manager one last time stating that we wouldn't be back.  We eat out three times a week and never usually leave a negative review but the rusty bucket needs to kick itself and go ahead and die and leave room for another establishment with more engaged wait staff and caring management.  Don't eat here unless you have no taste buds, are in a co-dependent relationship and don't mind being treated like an inconvenience, and made a resolution that you need to exercise more by walking back and forth for your own napkins, straws, and anything else you might need.",

My massive Beer Cheese Burger was outstanding, especially when washed down with a delicious local brew (they have a couple of dozen North Carolina crafts on tap). Service was friendly and efficient, and the cozy, family friendly setting was the perfect escape from a cold and rainy November day.

The soda was weak and the limes were dry to say the least. The waitress took the orders but never asked anyone what they would like for their sides just brung french fries with the orders that included the sides.The food had no flavor at all, absolutely no seasoning at all, the wings were supposed to be spicy garlic flavor, well the garlic was missing all together and the wings was just dipped in hot pepper sauce. The waitress customer service was very poor, instead of checking on us, we the customers were searching for her, until it appeared that we were finished with our meals. Customer service is so important!",

The bartender was rude and dismissive in all of our interactions & after looking at the menu, we decided 1 drink was all we could handle from the Rusty Bucket. I do not think I will be back.",

As a vegetarian, I'm always on the hunt for a good black bean burger, so that's what I ordered. The patty stays together well, which is a major win, but the flavor was a little bland... could've used some salt to bring out the flavor. Also, the regular fries were pretty great!   I'd definitely be willing to come back and try other menu items. The lady down one end of the bar was eating pizza that looked awesome! And the guy down the other end ordered an apple Betty dessert that looked amazing.   Oh and there's tons of free parking in the deck right there!",

There's nothing particularly special about it really other than convenience, beer and a friendly, easygoing atmosphere.  The menu is extensive with primarily bar food. Lots of sandwiches and burgers but a few entrees too. I have always loved the codwich. My girlfriend craves the pepperoni and banana pepper pizza. But make sure you specify that you want the banana pepper rings and not the Hungarian death peppers that could surprise you on this thing. The beer selection is great and plentiful with lots of truly local options (not just OMB). They even have a specific gluten-free menu if you ask for it - kinda unexpected honestly. And if you're looking for a gluten-sensitive beer you might check out the offerings from Wooden Robot. I hear most of their stuff is gluten sensitive.  Prices really aren't bad here. Comparable to quality and service. Which, by the way, service has always been great. There's one guy who hasn't served us since our first visit but remembers our faces every time we come in. As usual, we will be back when stress gets the better of us.",

She immediately mentioned that the Rusty Bucket is one of her favorites and as I had never been I was happy to follow her lead.  We sat outside on their patio which faces a few other restaurants, apartment buildings and parking.   We were immediately greeted by our server, Jessica. She took our drink ordered and allowed us time to look at the menu.  I ordered the Harvest Salad which came with roasted chicken, kale, cranberries, sweet corn, quinoa, farro, grape tomatoes, peppers, toasted pecans and almonds, fresh herbs and a sherry vinaigrette. I ordered the dressing on the side and it was delivered as such. I also asked for the peppers to be left out and it turns out they were part of the quinoa, farro, sweet corn, salad, so they brought that out on the side which was really sweet.   I thought prices were a little high, but I thought the quality of the food was good so I didn't mind paying a little extra.   Jessica was a great server and we gave her a glowing review on her review card.  Looking forward to coming back soon!",

We sat at the bar and there was definitely a \"usual crowd\" with the staff and patrons knowing each other, which was nice.   Brunch includes donut holes and those were on fluffy and warm and yummy. I had the breakfast burrito that came with potatoes and it was good and huge!   My friend got the breakfast sandwich was good-- it looked real good!   They have local cider on tap, gluten free menu available and daily drink specials too, so that's always a win in my book.",

Both delicious. Definitely go there if you can. Totally worth it!",

Had a funny experience last time my husband and I visited-- there was a couple at the bar watching the game and the man was casually rubbing his wife's bare foot with an ice cube for at least 20 minutes. We were cracking up over the incident and when our waitress realized what we were laughing about she just shook her head and muttered \"they're regulars\". Whatever it's a chill place!",

We only chose the place because it was a convenient location to meet friends and did not know what to expect, but it was wonderful! The best way to describe it is as an upscale tavern without a restaurant chain feel. We ate at a high top in the bar and it felt like we were in a high end hotel lounge, good service, great bar food, and just the right amount of TVs to watch the football game (not crazy like a sports bar, so we could actually have a conversation!). Would definitely go there again!",

    "text": "WOW oh WOW! One of the best buffalo chicken wraps I've had in Charlotte yet! And buffalo wraps hold a special place in my heart!   At first, you will miss it on the menu as it's listed as a buffalo chicken sandwich, but they will accommodate and make it into a wrap for you. The chicken was super (sorry I hate this word) moist and delicious! I believe it was breast meat so it was very tender. It was lightly breaded,  but didn't take away from the overall taste. I hate when all you can taste is the deep fried breading on the outside. The Rusty Bucket did it right!   The size of the wrap was enormous and I didn't think I would finish it- but of course I did. You can also substitute ranch instead of blue cheese if that's not your cup of tea.  Lastly, you can also substitute your side for a salad for slight up-charge. I got the wedge salad instead of fries and it was just as delicious as my wrap. You can't really mess up a wedge salad, but the cilantro dressing I got with it was awesome!   Geez, writing this review is making me crave a buff wrap right now!   Do yourself a favor, and get the Buff wrap!",

So,we met there one afternoon for lunch and it's not easy finding a parking spot---I wound up parking in the Whole Foods lot which I'm sure they don't appreciate.    I did order the soup but was so disappointed as there was just a half dollar size amount of cheese in the soup---my friend even said to me that is not what I got the last time I ate here---she said her soup was loaded with cheese, the kind that drapes over the side and you happily pull off or wind around your spoon. I ordered as my meal the chicken quesadilla's with corn and black beans ---they were tasty enough but could you spare the salsa and the tiny amount of sour cream?  My friend ordered the bucket of shrimp was certainly enough to feed two as an appetizer or one person ---she had really more than enough to eat .I may try the place once again because I believe in second chances but won't order the french onion soup. Way overpriced for the money and so disappointing.",

The recommended fried pickles were both greasy and had way too thick of a crust.  The Thai steak salad was fine but nothing special.  The strangest food was the tuna wrap.  The flavor of the wrap was very good however, it was underfilled and each half only contained a single small slice of tuna. The accompanying salad was a Greek salad and the flavored of feta and olive did not work as a pairing with an Asian wrap.  As much as I wanted to like this new restaurant, I will not be returning",

A server came to greet us and get our drink order and said he was sorry for the wait but was not our server for the night. We waited another ten minutes to get our beers from our ACTUAL server who then dropped off our drinks and started walking away without asking to take our order so I waived him down to place our order. I ordered the beer cheese burger cooked medium and my girl got a double stack quesadilla. It took TWENTY minutes to get  our food and guess what, it wasn't our server who brought it out to us.

    "text": "Recently went with a large group from work. We had multiple appetizers  (Shrimp bucket, Sliders, Fried Pickles and Quesadillia) all were very good. Our waiter did an excellent job and the atmosphere was also good.  I had salmon with sticky rice and mixed vegetables. The salmon was good, but not best I have had.  Rice and vegetables were good.  Overall, I thought this was a very good restaurant and I would recommend it for a mid range dinner.",

    "text": "I've eaten lunch here twice now and in short, if I don't like a place the first time, I rarely go back. Both of my visits yielded excellent service and really good food. On my first visit we sat inside in one of the comfortable booths. I had the open faced Philly Cheesesteak with fries. It was so darn good I was going to order it again yesterday (3 weeks after my first visit) but decided to change it up at the last minute and got the rueben with fries instead. We got a table outside this time. The rueben was excellent! The fries were good, but they were a little wilted this time. I still ate them all. Fresh cut fries are the rage now it seems and I don't think these are fresh cut, but they are still good. The prices are very reasonable too. Both our meals (we only had water this time) came to $21. I feel thats good for a restaurant of this caliber. I look forward to my next visit.",
