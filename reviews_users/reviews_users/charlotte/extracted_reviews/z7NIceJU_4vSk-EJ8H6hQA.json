    "text": "I was very pleasantly surprised.  I've traveled to India many times and make it a point to go to Indian restaurants when I travel to other cities in the US, so I've developed a bit of a taste for Indian food. I was not expecting much, I suppose due to its location and ubiquitous name, but the food was excellent (relative to other Charlotte Indian restaurants).   We got takeout on a Sunday night (another reason why my expectations were not super high) and once we got home, I could immediately tell we had potential. The chicken biryani was very good, perhaps not traditional, but its very hard to get good biryani in any restaurant around town and this was about as good as we've had so far.  The chicken tikka was also very good - not overly creamy and thick, but not too thin and with just the right taste - not all \"doctored\" up like some places like to do. Simple, yet right on point.  All in all, very good.  I'm rethinking my top Indian restaurants in town after this experience. Bombay Grille now goes towards the top. I gave it a 4 just because I tend to give my 5s to those rare places that I think were absolutely exceptional. I have not found a \"5\" among the Indian restaurants here in town yet.",

My tiki was great as well, very creamy and decent portion. Add in the naan and overall we enjoyed our meals. Service was a little slow for a week night but would come again.",

If this place was in NYC, San Francisco, LA, or any other big city with a larger Indian demographic, it would not succeed (IMHO).  But in a city with limited options for Indian cuisine, many people like it because they don't know any better.  Or they eat at B.G. because there's really not a lot of better options.  Bombay Grille is more authentic than most Indian joints around town, but definitely isn't \"the real deal\".  If this place was in a big city I'd give it one star.  But everything is relative in life so I'll give em two.",

    "text": "Visited on a Wednesday for the lunch buffet and arrived around 1120am. When my roommate and I first got there, we were the only patrons there!  I thought perhaps we were early, but throughout our meal only one other table with two customers were there and when they left a mother and daughter came in towards the end of our meal.  Our waiter was friendly, he came to refill our waters twice.  Other than that we really didn't see him.  I was a bit disappointed in the selection. There were 3 vegetarian /vegetable options, 3 chicken options and a couple of of other things like soup, potato wedges, and rice pudding that was extremely soupy. I am a vegetarian, so I was already limited in my choices.  At one point I went back to get some more rice and the rice was never refilled, so I was literally scrapping the bowl!  I mostly ate a dish with broccoli in a tomato sauce, which was by far my most favored item on the day's buffet menu.  While I did have an enjoyable time with my roommate, my taste buds were not jumping for joy as I had previously imagined that they would.  I love Indian food, but my experience at Bombay Grille was although not horrible, was also not what I would envision as something to be repeated.  Normally at buffets I can usually eat between 2-3 plates.  Their food was extremely heavy and could only eat one full plate.  After leaving the restaurant I took a nap and very long walk afterwards, and I still was full to the point of being uncomfortable.  I am grateful that I did not have to work that day, I would have been miserable.  I even thought that possibly they put heavy cream in their food, but of course I am not in their kitchen, so that will go unknown.  Food has never made me feel that way.    Key points that I was disappointed in were: 1. Buffets usually have a great selection, so that a person can sample several different dishes- Bombay Grille failed here. 2. Indian buffets usually have at least one dish with paneer- Bombay Grille failed here. 3. Indian buffets are supposed to have several different curry dishes (mild, medium, spicy and different kinds of curry). There was only one curry chicken dish.- FAIL 4. Bombay Grille- FAILed to refill the rice.. there were only 4 people in there at any given time!!!!  I'd hate to see what the buffet would like after 20 minutes if it was packed or even half way full. 5. Where were the spices? It's bad enough that there wasn't any good curry or paneer, but I couldn't taste any spices.  In my opinion, this is an Americanized Indian restaurant. I could not taste any pepper, cardamon, anise, cumin, cinnamon, cloves, saffron, tamarind or turmeric! -FAIL 7. Naan- didn't taste like it was homemade.. looked and tasted like store bought and it was plain.. they didn't have garlic naan!  By the time I had some, it was cold, chewy and blah.  No ghee and naan!  No spices or raisin and naan.  NOT SATISFIED! 6. The price for the selection. - FAIL  The decor is slightly plain.. the only redeeming quality was what I was craving for over a month since moving to Charlotte.. a Mango Lassi.  Overall, I would not return to this restaurant.. the food quality, selection and price were less than stellar.  I've heard great things about \"Passage to India\" in the University area and can't wait to check it out!",

Atmosphere was nice, dark with lots of recessed lighting, you could definitely go casual or dress fancy and be in place with either. The service was really good, fairly quick to take your order and bring out plates. Plus, they had a waitress constantly refilling your glass of water (which can be a blessing at an Indian restaurant if you accidentally order something to spicy for your taste!)  Half of the menu was vegetarian, thumbs up for that!!  I was impressed that they immediately bring out a complimentary plate of very thin flat bread and chutneys as soon as you're seated. We ordered the veg sampler appetizer, which was pretty good. I definitely preferred the paneer pakoras and cauliflower pakoras over the samosas. I ordered the malai kafta as my main course, good. Garlic naan and paneer bread were very impressive.  I enjoyed Bombay Grille, but it doesn't top the quality of food at Woodlands... I'm forever spoiled.",

The staff James good. They're very attentive and the restaurant decor is great. Indian restaurants are known for their lunch buffet. I enjoyed dinner at BG but the restaraunt's buffet wasn't great so I couldn't give it 5 stars. I actually debated giving it 3, but ordering from the menu will result in a great experience, so I will go with a 4.   Also, while the atmosphere is definitely kid friendly, almost all of the buffet options are fairly spicy, too spicy for almost all kids. I love spicy food so I enjoyed it and it wasn't overwhelmingly spicy for me and wouldn't be for most adults. Again, when you order from the menu, this is not an issue.   Cooper on East Blvd is a great Indian cuisine option.",

The paneer dish as well as one of the chicken dishes had the same masala gravy which was extremely sweet. The chaat dish was mushy and uninspired. The chicken fried rice dish had almost inedibly tough chicken. To top it off the restaurant does not understand the concept of keeping the buffet food hot. Atleast the music was not intrusive and there was no tvs in the dining area as in other less than acceptable establishments. The service was polite but not very frequent. When it comes to authentic indian food, this doesn't count. Get some real indian chefs and don't try to adapt the food to the location of its patrons. You might then stand a chance.  1 Star.",

Now let me be clear, I'm surprised it stays in business because every time I go there for lunch, it's dead.  Shocking really at any buffet, but especially at a buffet where the food is as good as it is here.    It's really really good.  The naan is fresh, the Chicken Kormi and chicken curry are delicious.  Any time they serve lamb, consider yourself lucky - it's amazing.    To top it off, they often have rice pudding available to finish off the destruction of your blood sugar.  It's great!  The only problem is that it usually has to sit on top of two plates of delicious food and soup which means your stomach is about to overflow.    The service is also respectable, and it seems as though the same 4 or 5 guys are always working, so if you're a regular, they'll recognize you.    The only reason it's not a 5 star place is the decor and cleanliness.  I'm not saying its dirty, but it's not sparkling, and the dimly lit dining room doesn't bestow confidence in germaphobes.    I would however recommend this place to any foodie type who knows that sometimes you have to look past some of the details to find the gems.",

    "text": "Good Indian food is hard to come by, in most cases. Charlotte has quite a few options and I'm happy to say that Bombay Grille has stolen the spotlight for me.   I had heard great things and read all of the shining reviews they had to date. I was pleased to find a very humble dining room, complete with appropriate music. I love me some Indian tunes!  We started out with the standard pappadaam cracker bread. Very brittle and filled with flavorful spices. All three dips/sauces were choice. Fresh, pungent and never lacking in flavor or interest.   Next, pakoras. These little fried bundles of joy make something as boring as cauliflower AWESOME. An assortment of lightly fried and seasoned veggies, dusted with cumin. Tender, flavorful and intriguing. Worth every penny.   Then, garlic cheese naan. If you don't get this, you're missing out. Awesome flavors. A perfect marriage of textures as well. If you have some of the sauces left over from you pappadaam, USE THEM. All work with the naan and rather well, I might add.   Entrees. My wife had the Palak Paneer. Green and savory sauce. Filled with fresh herbs and chalk full of hefty chunks of fresh, house-made paneer (Indian Cheese). Tofu-ish texture and perfect for topping on your rice or MORE naan. I'd get this dish and I'm not even a vegetarian.   I had the Lamb Korma. Dude, I love me some lamb. They do this up RIGHT. Tons of flavors swirling around a hilarious amount of steamed rice. I can't think of one thing I didn't like about this dish. Other than when it was all gone. *tear*  Service was top notch. Get ready for some contestant visits from your server(s). They'll upsell you a lot, too. Always will ask if you want more of....EVERYTHING.   Price is very reasonable as well. Me made it out under $50 for the two of us.   If you're in Pineville and looking for some ethnic, culinary greatness, Bombay is the dankness.  These guys do quite a bit of couponing as well. Seen quite a few around these parts. Also, they do FoodieCall. Get that stuff delivered! BOOM!  Cheers!",

    "text": "WOW and yummy :) Reviews are only on Vegetarian dishes. Best place to be in a group (both friends and family), not very expensive.  Where should I start, one of the best Indian restaurants in Charlotte. I liked the ambiance, not too   Indian style but nice and pleasant. For Vegetarians, we have many options to try and my personal choice will be samosa (It's crispy... go for it).   Every time we visit,  we make sure we order \"Shahi Makai Dhingri\" ( I would call it their signature dish). It is not hot spicy but it's creamy and very tasty. It goes very well with garlic naan(bread) and other naans. Vegetable pulav (rice) is also very good and it can be served for one person per meal.   I would recommend you guys to try their Kufi for desserts and halwa was decent (personally it's not up to my mark) but my friends like it.  Side Note : They were about to introduce chocolate samosa. I am not sure about it but just ask them and try if you guys feel having something different.",

I live in Matthews, but I still make  the trip to Pineville for this food.  The dining area is a bit dark for me, but gives the place a unique atmosphere for a dining experience.  The servers are in all black and are very quick and attentive to re-fills (especially critical when eating spicy food since you may need some emergency cooling chugs).  The servers do a good job of telling you what dish is what as well.  Hopefully one day I can be pretty good at ordering and being familiar with certain dishes.  There are a ton of vegetarian options on the menu.  I tend to lean toward the carnivore side of the menu, but I tried the Palak Paneer and it was excellent (if you enjoy spinach and cottage cheese).  I'm hoping as Charlotte grows to be more diverse, more places like this show up on the map.",

Like in the buffet, they had, among other things, tandoori chicken, of which I took a few pieces, just freshly in.  I got the first serving of naans, and had to wait a bit between finishing the first basket and  getting the second.  By then, the chicken had gotten cold.  As for the naans, they were flat, and some slightly crispy, instead of soft.  The tamarind chutney was okay.  In terms of drinks, they are surprisingly limited - only mango lassi/sweet lassi or the sodas.  No fresh lime sodas (lemonade variants) that one would expect from an Indian place  Conclusion: might be worth trying out for a la carte meals, but certainly not the buffet.",

    "text": "I teeter between 3 and 4 stars on this review but I decided to be nice :)  We almost missed it because the \"bomb\" on their sign is not lit up so it says \"AY GRILLE\"  currently.  That almost turned me away.  I have this weird stigma with restaurants or shops that have half a sign lit up without fixing it.  It just seems so bootleg.  But, I pressed on...  Atmosphere-- Not much to write home about, a little dingy, a little 70's/80's with the mirrors and lighting, rather small so we were literally on top of another party, etc.  Service--They seemed super busy or way understaffed.  A 10 year old little boy sat us but then we didn't see another soul for at least 15 minutes.  No drink order, no greeting, no wine list, nothing.  So, that was really weird.  When the waiter finally approached us we asked for a wine list but that was the wrong thing to do because he ended up pulling his disappearing act again.  We noticed there was a party of 8 that must have been sat RIGHT before us so we just got their sloppy leftovers.  Was it bad that I was glaring at the party and that I was thinking to myself they have SOME nerve coming up in there taking over the joint?  haha...  When the server was ready to take our order he literally looked like he was breaking a sweat.  I totally get it, I have served tables before so I sorta felt bad for him.  However, that didn't prevent me from noticing that we had been there for an hour with nothing to show for.    **they were REALLY good about refilling waters though.    The Food---the food was their saving grace.  I am pretty much giving them 4 stars based on the food alone.  I thought it was really good.  The garlic naan was so fresh, the chicken korma was cooked to perfection, and had just the perfect amount of flavor, the rice was done well, etc.  The only thing is that there wasn't very much chicken in the tikki masala--just a few big chunks so hubby left hungry.  I also found the masala sauce to be too pastey...it was like a spaghetti sauce in a way.  But, it was good.  I'm not holding the bad service against them.  I clearly came on an \"off\" night.  If the big oversized party wasn't dominating the whole restaurant then it would have been a much more pleasant experience.  So, I will give them the benefit of the doubt and I will return if they get the sign fixed ;)",

Whole place was empty, yet it took 45 mins for four entrees to arrive. Waiter got one order wrong and was apologetic but then it took another 25 mins for the correct dish to arrive, and when it did it was missing the side it was supposed to come with. Only flavorful thing on the entire table was the palak paneer. Still, I've had far better elsewhere. Nothing about our experience was positive. Well- maybe the ample parking. Otherwise, it was a total waste of $100. All four of us agreed as we were walking out that we would never go back.",

However, last Sunday (2/26/17) my boyfriend went to pick up our food for take-out, and was made to feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable by the 2 women working the register. As, I too, find him to be a very attractive man, I'm never surprised or annoyed by flirtatious attempts from other women.   But while waiting for the food (after asking him to speak Spanish for them, and complimenting his accent/skin tone/eye color), one of these two young ladies working asked if he had \"ever been with a black girl\" -- following which the second girl asked \"well have you ever been with a white girl?\" -- Feeling uncomfortable, he left his reply short stating he has a girlfriend, picked up his food and left.    In an effort to not publicly lambast Bombay Grille, we have tried to contact the owner or manager. Unfortunately, no one will answer the phone, you cannot leave a voice mail, and the Emergency contact number provided does not allow us to reach anyone.   Again, great food. But we won't be returning thanks to this highly inappropriate service.",

This was very embarrassing for me and the only sore point during my daughter's wedding. Bride, groom and the guests at the back of the line didn't get food. I was later told by some friends that they had encountered food shortage at another wedding where food was catered by #Bombaygrille. Unfortunately I found this out too late.

The spice definitely packs a punch, so if you are sensitive, then don't go above a 1! Very delicious, generous portions.  Service was attentive.

    "text": "Even though I have earlier commented on the costliness of their meals, I have to say that their food is very good, eating-wise.  Their chicken tikka masala  is tasty.  The sauce alone is a meal over their nice rice.  Not much chicken, but it really is the sauce anyway.  So with the naan bread.  They have the tandoor oven so the bread is cooked with some char and retains its soft texture.  Naan for dipping is excellent.  When calling in for a take out order, they tell you 20 minutes, but apparently they do not start cooking your order until after you arrive and have paid in advance.  Their phone rings continually, as there are many who order take-out.  Four people were waiting with me last night who had called in.  All of us had been told 20 minutes and it took that amount of time or longer to actually get your order once in the door.  Not many happy campers last night.  So...sit down is better with your time than take-out.  Remember to order a bit more so you will leave satisfied.  And if calling in an order to-go, expect to wait at least 20 minutes before you can leave.",

    "text": "Place could easily be better if the prices weren't so high. $14.50-12.50 for majority of their chicken dishes but maybe that's normal. Portions seemed small even though we couldn't finish it all I feel like for that price we could've been served a lot more.   My main concern was the water tasting like cleaner and we couldn't drink but a sip before ordering a mango lassi which was good but also has a strong goat milk/Greek yogurt taste but we enjoyed it even if it was also small haha.   The food is flavorful and delicious. I LOVED the tikka masala. It's so creamy and tomato based and tastes perfect with the rice to balance it out. I'd love if there were more vegetables with it like some onion or red pepper so it's not just 8 bites of chicken in the sauce but I read that the fish is mainly for the sauce. It'd just be perfect for me if it had some veggies in it. My boyfriend liked his chicken kadhi but I preferred my meal over his way more. I absolutely love curry and although I usually get Thai curry and eat at Thai House I decided to try Bombay because I never have after all these years going to Thai house.   The lamb appetizer was nice but not too flavorful. The meat was sort of like dumpling meat as it was mashed up and very moist with chives/green onions. The outside was crispy.   It was sad that this place was so barren. When we came in a couple was leaving which left us alone in the restaurant but when we left a family came in so maybe they have slow but steady business. Our waiter was kind and in explaining the dishes and the food came out in about 15 minutes or so as they were doing to go orders before putting our order in even though we were the only customers present.   Our total bill was about $50 with tip which is pretty high for us but we were hungry and were tired of driving around looking for a good spot to eat for our 5 year anniversary as the previous spot we went to eat at had no sushi chef and couldn't serve sushi (which is what we came to that resturaunt for) but everything happens for a reason I guess.",

    "text": "Went here on Valentines day for lunch and was so disappointed! Sat down, got water and was told to help ourselves to the buffet. It was meager pickings and seemed like a bunch of stuff made from leftovers. All chicken and veggie dishes and only 4 entrees, 2 types of rice, some veggies, soup, one appetizer and the stuff on the cold bar. Nothing tasted amazing and the tandoori chicken was so dry. I honestly barely wanted to eat but decided to do a small sampling of each item in hopes that one thing would jump out at me. Nope! Maybe it was an off day. Maybe we were eating leftovers, maybe not. But I do know I won't be back. We passed up trying a new place just up the street from our house (Dakshin Indian Grill) to try this place because my husband had lunch here with a co-worker and said it was really good. Well, it was good on that day but not the day we went. The place is a bit dingy and the buffet area needs a total makeover. Equipment and chafing dishes need some fixing and updating for sure.  I was so ready for some good Indian food but it just didn't pan out that day. Indian food should be full of complex and amazing spices and flavors and each dish should have its own character and nuances. This food tasted very bland. Maybe this place is fantastic sometimes but it wasn't that day. Thank you, next!  That is all!",

We came here on Sunday for my brothers birthday with a huge crowd and we were constantly being assisted and served swiftly and smoothly by multiple waitstaff. We always get the lamb rogan josh, it's a classic and never disappoints but we also tried the chili chicken this time which was bomb!! They are known for the family style serving making it easy for everyone to get to try a little of everything. If you're going to get a drink, go for the simi chardonnay or the Taj Mahal beer!!  I'm pretty sure during brunch hours they also have a buffet towards the back of the restaurant.",

Last year we really wanted Indian food so we turned to yelp and ended up here. Here we are a year later enjoying yet another lunch.   This place by no means is perfect. If you've been to other Indian buffets, you'll definitely compare. But everything tastes very authentic. That might weird to hear, but compared to Indian restaurants that I've been to, the flavors are layered here. Most places in Georgia(where we're from) the flavor is just one level. What you smell and put in your mouth will be the same after you chew it. But here, when I smell it and it touches my tongue for the first time, it's turns into something different after I keep chewing. This is by far the weirdest review on yelp I've ever posted, but I think it deserves this level of weirdness.   The naan is always fresh. They bring it out to you as opposed to it being already at the buffet bar. Also, the naan is a bit on the thicker side. If you're a thick naan person, then this is the place to go.",

Garlicky and cheese goodness enrobed in oven baked naan. Seekh kabob was next and didn't disappoint. Served on a sizzling platter of mint scented lamb, onions and peppers. For the entrees the ask which level of heat you desire. 1-5. 5 being hottest. I chose the Aloo Vinadoo l. A potato dish with a spicy sauce;  I chose a level of 4. I was happy with the heat level. It was hot but not inedible. My partner enjoyed the Baingan Bhartha. An exquisite blend of creamy eggplant and Indian spices. We have enjoyed Indian in other places but this one gets high marks. Service was also friendly and they worked well as a team to ensure guest satisfaction.  Will definitely return...as soon as my mouth cools.",

I've never tried their dinner though.  Firstly, the service is absolutely amazing! The servers are all so kind and willing to assist. They are quick with refills and anything else you need. Never had to ask for a refill. They just came on their own. Also, the naan is fantastic. It's thick and fluffy, but it also crisp on the outside. And third, the food is great! Their food tastes authentic and real. The food isn't too fragrant or spicy for people who have sensitive palettes. It's just enough spice and bursting with flavor.  The only thing that they could work on is having more choices. They have great dishes out but with an addition of two or so more dishes, they could really be the best Indian buffet!  If you live in Charlotte or are visiting, come here for lunch! It's a decent price and is soooooo worth it!!!",

The dishes are filled with paneer, meat, or veggies.  They do not skimp... great way to feed a crowd and keep your kitchen clean.  They also catered my wedding.  I really can't tell you how great they did, especially since they had to make the trip to Columbia, SC for the event. The Indian restaurants in my hometown leave something to be desired, so we went with a Charlotte caterer  We had a tasting at the restaurant, the owner drove down to the site to see the venue and attended the event to make sure everything went well.  The food was perfect, looked great and tasted even better, actually, it tasted even better than the tasting samples.  We were so impressed and everyone said they would be using his restaurant in the future.    Am I gushing?    Well, I guess I am, which is really rare for me... its just that through this whole wedding process, you find that it is rare when a company really lives up to their promises.  They did a great job, very professional.",

I felt extremely uncomfortable there, and the buffet was not worth its price.",

    "text": "The smell of this place was a striking mixture of chai masala tea, cardamom and curry spices. The wait staff sat our group of four in a small middle table. This was a bit uncomfortable and we had requested a booth, but hey, they were busy.  We started off with two appetizers along with two bottles of La Crema, a delicious white that quenched the flame of the hot vindaloo dishes. My favorite appetizer was their sweet peshwari naan with cherries and coconut. This stuff tastes like pie filling!  Add to that the freshly baked puti (puffed bread) and we were on our way to fantastic meal.  Bombay Cuisine shines when it comes to curries, offering seemingly endless variations. Plus, you can choose the level of spiciness to suit your own tastes.  We ordered a five, not American five, but Indian five. The extra chilies cleared my sinuses and made my temperature rise.  As a vegetarians I found nirvana in the muthia (Indian dumplings) in a  vegetable cream sauce. We ordered three different curries and the carnos ordered tandoori chicken. The curries were served with basmati rice.  Overall the best dish was the peshwari naan. Never had I experienced a bread product that thrilled my taste buds in such a way. If you go try this naan and surely you will walk away satisfied.",

My friend really liked the dessert which was some kind of fruit pudding, I myself would rather have Kheer,Ras Malie or that Indian dessert that is made out of carrots not sure of the name However  I really enjoyed the Chicken Tikka and the Korma. And I felt the service was great especially since we had a toddler with us , the waiter was so friendly and helpful with the toddler,  and I was impressed by that and the fact that he kept our water glasses filled and had a smile on his face the whole time. Super friendly service... A++ service . I will definitely be back. The only thing I think needs improvement is keeping the buffet re-stocked.  That is why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 stars.",

I will honestly say my experience with Indian food is fairly limited but I LOVED Bombay Grille!  We ordered the Samosas, garlic naan, chicken korma, and chicken vindaloo. I love spicy so we got level 4 on the korma and the waiter warned me the vindaloo was very hot. I have to admit the vindaloo was super hot lol... It was amazingly good but it did make my eyes water at first. The korma was a perfect 4 and was very good! As for the naan an samosas, I was in heaven both were awesome. The rice was okay (seemed a little under cooked) And that was my Only negative. We also ordered 2 masala chai teas and my aunt was impressed said it was the best she's had! All in all this was a fantastic experience, the staff was attentive and helpful and I will be back very soon to try more of their dishes and their lunch buffet!!",

The sauces were really tastey and they do a good job of adjusting the heat up or down according to tolerance. The garlic naan seemed really thick- which could've been a fluke because I don't remember it ever being like that before. I've been here about 5 times.  Nice atmosphere, nice service, tastey samosas (on the hot side!!!).  Here's the deal- I would go here if that's where my friends wanted to go (which is what happened last week). But I would not choose to go otherwise when there are two other Indian restaurants that I enjoy so much more.",

    "text": "There's no doubt Indian cuisine does not readily spring to mind when considering suitable restaurants to which to take the kids.  In fact, for many parents, the presence of hot spices, strange tastes and the probable absence of kid-friendly crayons unequivocally consign this option to the absolutely, positively, never category.   But should it?  If my families recent experience of the top-rated Bombay Grille is anything to go by, then perhaps curry deserves some inclusion in your future deliberations.    Located in the Tower Place Shopping Center on the Pineville-Matthews road, there is nothing distinguishable about the restaurant itself; the internal decor offers little to grab the eye, and its position in a fairly nondescript strip mall smacks of a mediocre dining experience.  However, superficialities like this are never a reliable indicator.   Once seated, our attentive waiter wasted no time in getting food to our table; Papadums; traditional Indian flat breads served with chutneys: fresh mint and cilantro, spicy onions in a tomato base, and a tamarind paste.  They are excellent munchies with which to relax and peruse the menu.  And the menu takes some perusing; infinite choices of vegetarian, chicken, lamb and sea food entrees together with my favorite, the tandoori (clay oven) selections.  Our waiter suggested some lightly spiced options for the kids; we chose a plain nan bread, and chicken makhani - clay oven roasted, then folded into a creamy tomato sauce.  The jaded parent-types decided on chicken tikka masala, lamb rogan josh, and the freshly baked, sublime peshwari nan - a leavened bread stuffed with cherry, cashew nuts, almonds, raisins and coconut.       This represented a good introduction to traditional Indian cuisine for our young children.  Our seven and eight year old boys seemed content enough without any noticeable whining, and our three year old daughter is a complete rice fiend, so no problems there either.  Almost all the entrees can be spiced mild, medium or hot, so you decide.  The absence of crayons never became an issue either; in fact, this turned into a positive with more family conversation at the table.               I can't over state the quality of food coming out of this restaurant.  Occasionally, I am fortunate enough to eat food which compels the eyes to roll up in their sockets.  Food such as this abounds here.  A further representation of quality is the abundance of Indian guests also dining.  Go at the weekend for the lunch buffet ($8.95), or during the week ($7.95).",

This probably isn't a real, traditional Indian side order, but it is nonetheless very delicious.

I KNOW this is a common practice to get a higher bill, but seriously, I am an adult, and I know what my caloric intake should be.

    "text": "Bombay Grille has excellent chicken korma. Their weekday lunch buffet has really tasty food as well. You can find authentic tandoori chicken , an assortment of curries, sauces, rice, fruity, and vegetarian options. Their naan is pretty awesome as well. What I really like is that their staff are very friendly and knowledgeable! Their prices are very reasonable too. Great place!",

    "text": "I must say, I went in for the buffet but I couldn't help myself but to actually order from the menu.  I really wanted a sense of what the food and service was like fresh.  I came in my waiter asked what u would like to drink, he filled my glass then I notified him I would be ordering from a menu.  He was very very pleasent, promptly brought me a menu and u ordered my favorite from back home, chicken Tikka masala and garlic naan.  Yes basic, but absolutely delish.    Lots of sauce for dipping, chicken was abundant, tender and juicy.  My glass was never empty or in danger of being empty.  Nice surroundings.   I cannot wait to go back.  This resaurant deff hit the spot",

I've only ever eaten their buffet ($9.95 weekday) and thats just fine with me. I love to try a little bit of all the different flavors, and then wash it all down with a mango lassi. If you live anywhere in South Charlotte, its worth trying. It isn't a fancy place (if that's what you are looking for), but it's fine, and the food is why I keep going back!",

I make far better indian food at home. Meat was not cooked properly and was very chewy. Overall I don't recommend it and won't be going back at all. Oh yeah their carpets were dirty with food everywhere,seems like they don't vacuum at all or very little.",

    "text": "I'm teetering between a 3 and 4...but I choose a 4 and I'll tell you why in a second.  I came with friends a few Sundays ago and I fell in love with this type of buffet-I generally equate buffets with Golden Corral and run the other way.  For a newbie to Indian food, its great to be able to try a little bit of everything.  If you love food that uses a variety of spices in unusual combinations (not necessarily spicy as in hot), Bombay Grille provides a nice introduction to Indian food.  The buffet is small-ish and usually has several chicken dishes-butter chicken, curried chicken, and chicken vindaloo among others.  The sauces are out-of-this-world delicious and even the paneer (Indian tofu) has a bouncy texture.  The buffet includes fresh naan brought to your table, which you can dip in the delicious sauces from the entrees.  They have a strange looking dish that is chopped spinach, mint, and chickpeas-looks like baby poo but tastes delicious!    The reason that this place deserves 4 stars is the mango custard desert.  It is creamy. delicious, and helps cool off my over-spiced American palate after a spicy meal.  I would bathe in this stuff if I could!!!  Be sure to save room for dessert.    Tip: The Sunday buffet is more expensive ($12), so try it during the week if you're budget-conscious.",
