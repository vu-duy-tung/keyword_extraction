    "text": "For lunch yesterday, I got a craving for BBQ.  I did not really feel like fighting the crowds at Mac's Speed Shop today, no matter how good the 'cue is.  After doing some research, I found Shane's Rib Shack, which is fairly close to my office.  Shane's Rib Shack is a chain BBQ restaurant, with restaurants in 14 states, primarily in the southeastern United States.  There are 2 Charlotte-area locations: near Northlake Mall and the University area.  I went to the one in the University area.  When I arrive, I find that it's located in a \"shopping center\".  It just so happens that the lunch special was their smothered pork sandwich with a side, so that is what I ordered.  For my side, I chose Brunswick stew.  I place my order and grab a seat.  The first thing I notice is that they have multiple sauces available.  Naturally, I had to give them a shot.  All of the sauces were primarily tomato-based.  The original sauce had a bold but not overpowering flavor.  I could taste hints of mustard and chili powder in the sauce.  The hot sauce had essentially the same flavor profiles as the original, but it also had some back heat.  My favorite out of the three was the spicy sauce.  It contained the bold flavors of the original sauce and the back heat of the hot sauce while adding a level of complexity through what tasted like ground peppercorns.  The sauces were not all that complicated and overwhelming, but they were solid.  And sometimes solid is just what the doctor ordered.  Less than five minutes after ordering (and literally right after finishing the sauce tasting), my meal comes out.  The first thing I notice is the size of the sandwich -- it's significantly larger than I expected.  This is a plus!  I was expecting a sandwich on a normal-sized bun.  Instead, the bun was extra large (about 25% larger than a normal sandwich bun) and piled high with plenty of pork (along with some slaw).  The pork on the sandwich was pulled, with the pieces varying in size.  There was a nice mixture of pork and \"outside brown\".  There was not a lot of smoke flavor in the meat, which was not a surprise.  However, the pork was very moist, and I could actually taste the meat.  I went ahead and added the spicy sauce to the sandwich and ate away.  All in all, a solid sandwich.  After finishing off the sandwich, I moved to the Brunswick stew.  At first glance, this did not resemble anything stew-ish at all.  There were ample amounts of the pulled pork along with the other requisite ingredients that constitute Brunswick stew.  All in all, I found that the taste of this was solid too.  If it was not for the portion size of the sandwich, I probably would say that the portion of the stew was a bit on the small side.  Overall, I would say that Shane's Rib Shack (at least this particular location) is a safe choice when it comes to BBQ.  For most people who may not be as picky about their BBQ, they will absolutely love it  This review is available with pictures at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bigwaynerbbq.com%2F2011%2F02%2F10%2Freview-shanes-rib-shack-charlotte-nc%2F&s=2d1276d94096907e43941f1a9145fca84ef2996be847ebab93e1d48b5a8ff466\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bigwaynerbbq.com/2011/02...</a>.",

    "text": "We stopped in for dinner, while in the area,  because we have eaten at other locations before. I had the pulled pork, sweet potato fries and hush puppies while my husband had the chopped chicken, baked beans, with French fries. My husband said his chicken tasted TERRIBLE and there was barely any there, on his platter. My sweet potato fries were mushy and hush puppies weren't cooked thoroughly. I mentioned this to the young lady working the cash register and she told me that she would have them remake them. Order after order after order came out for customers, who came in after us, was brought to their tables. We waited, for quite some time, before I went back to the same young lady, asking where they were at so I could finish my meal. Again, she told me that she would check to see how much longer it would be. So, we waited for an additional 20 minutes, but NOTHING! We ended up just leaving. Apparently, it's MORE important for people, who are SUPPOSED to be working at doing their job, to play on their cell phone rather than doing their job and checking on their customers. TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE service.",

    "text": "Last review from my Emily my Niece as we completed our short vacation to Charlotte NC. My comments follow.  \"Hello again this shall be one of my last reviews so I hope you like it. I personally think that Shanes is a pretty good rib shop. A great deal there is the big daddy. The big daddy is a sandwich with chopped pork barbecue but u get it plain with no sauce there is a booth there you can BBQ sauce. They have original, hot, and spicy. I enjoyed my lunch!\"  My comments Pros - Good smokey ribs (full rack about $19). NC BBQ (pulled pork). Big Daddy BBQ sandwich. Sides: Brunswick Stew, slaw, mac & cheese. - All you can handle BBQ sauce - very tasty - good kick. - Mall parking - Great NC hospitality & service (\"Sir\", everything OK, etc). - Plenty of seating inside  Cons - Full rack of ribs didn't seem like full rack I normally get in California.  Return Visit - Yes, next time I'm in NC",

The BBQ chicken was pretty good, the chicken fingers were surprisingly great & the hush puppies were fantastic. The fries were OK, the cole slaw was good, the sweet potato fries were good. The others I was with enjoyed the ribs & the BBQ (pork). The peach cobbler was pretty good & the peach (sweet) tea was tasty. I'm not saying it's the best BBQ or anything, but for the price & fast food, I think it's well worth it.",

    "text": "Day one of my Vegetarian diet...that I'm starting tomorrow.  It's actually part of the plan.  Really!  I'm just prepping my body for the shock of the lack of meat protein.  So when in the Cackalacks I had to seek out some of that famous BBQ.     I've never had Carolina BBQ so I had to indulge.  To get a good roundabout idea of what its all about I opted for the sampler plate, vice one of everything on the menu.  Don't want to indulge too much, after all I am on a diet!  On the scale of American BBQ's this was okay.  TX BBQ is, in my opinion, da best!  Not to say this was horrible or anything.  The meat was cooked well but still juicy.  Ribs were unique, on the sweet side ( I guess thats the way they do it in the Cackalacks)   Chicken was good.  I had some grilled fillets with their Buff-Q sauce.  Sauce was okay too.     I had the peach tea, which I thought was really good.  Not too sweet but sweet enough.  I'm already sick of sweet tea.  Not here, but just in general.     The service was good, although the server dropped my toast.  She did offer me to get another one but never came back with it.  I ate it anyway.  (she dropped it on the table!)  She was friendly and thoughtful though.  Just have to follow through.     Overall, didn't blow my socks off in the way of BBQ's in general but as far as Carolinian BBQ, I'm still on a limb about it.   This review might change as I experience more.  Must sample more.  Thank God I'm on a vegetarian diet.",

I wasn't expecting a lot out of the chicken, but they were surprisingly tasty.  They were all breast meat, crispy, and flavorful.  They offered to toss them in one of about 8 or so sauces, but my dh and I have different taste and ordered sauce on the side.    The ribs were very tender and meaty.  The pulled pork was moist and flavorful, and they gave us a very generous portion.  We tried a number of sauces, and all were tasty.  We enjoyed the potato salad, but I wasn't a big fan of the coleslaw, which seemed overly vinegary.  Our order was brought quickly, and the employees were friendly.  Shane's has an outdoor eating area, but it backs up to W.T. Harris.  I think it would be pretty noisy to eat out there.  All in all, I was very pleased, and we will be coming back soon!",

When I first walked in, I thought the environment's decorations were nice.  Nothing fancy, but it had a homey feeling.  There are some TV's scattered around the restaurant so that you can watch a game while you're eating.  I don't really care about that because I'm always in the zone when I eat, but others may not be dedicated like I am.  As soon as you walk through the door, the counter for you to order the food is smack right there!  Very convenient.  So let's get on to the ribs.  BOMB.  Have I ever tasted anything so delish?  Well, yeah, but the ribs are pretty up there on my delicious food list.  I am never disappointed time after time again when I visit.  On Saturdays, they have a special where the half rack of ribs are $10, so I find myself there on occasionally weekends.  Their potato salad isn't too shabby either!  If you're in the University area, you definitely need to check this place out!",

I can not imagine how they have two sauces less hot unless one of them is mayonnaise or something.  I opted to swap out my fries for greens. Granted it is a matter of preference but all the delicious vinegar and pepper I find in my favorite greens is replaced with meat flavor and sweetness If that is your style, then go for it, but I was left wanting.  Theoretically, I could go back and try their BBQ but their prices aren't particularly cheap and, despite the best attempts of the extremely friendly hostess, the experience I had isn't going to woo me away from my more drool-inducing BBQ haunts.",

I know this a chain restaurant but so is McDonald's and McDonald's produces a good hot burger and delicious fries. I don't think I'll be returning to this place.",

I will never go here again and waste $26!! I know we went at 8 and they close at 9, but u should always have hot food & food that taste fresh! Not day old!!n no stars for this place!!

That said, I must not be an expert compared to some of the reviews I am seeing because I think Shane's has pretty much the best BBQ and ribs of any place I've tried.  I like mustard or vinegar based (tangier) sauces and Shane's has those in abundance.  They also have free kids meals on Sundays and a military discount that makes them a VERY friendly veteran spot as well.  The BBQ is fresh, smokey, and flavorful and the cole slaw is perfect if you add a dash of the sizzle sauce to it.  Ribs are tender, well-seasoned and plentiful and the Brunswick stew is a must-try - even if it is just a cup.  The peach cobbler is an excellent finish to an outstanding meal.  Catering is an option as well and the service is awesome.",

Their sauces are excellent and the resturant is always clean. The wings and tenders are my favorites and worth the price!  The tenders are huge and all white meat chicken, you can get them naked or with a flavor.  The only down side is price.  It can be on the pricey side for a meal and not the greatest place for those on a budget.  Overall the service is good (it's not a full service spot) you have to get your own drinks and sauces but who cares.  If your in the mood for BBQ and have a couple of dollars...then Shane's will curb your appetite.",

The cashier is also responsible to process phone orders, which holds up the line of people waiting to order.  Not a problem today at the university location. In fact, I about had the place to myself at 1 pm.  I walked in and had to wait for the cashier to come out of the back somewhere. After she took my order, she delivered my chicken tenders to me in just a couple of minutes. The portion size was much smaller than what i'm used to, but still tasty. Are they cutting payroll and serving sizes to save $? Not sure, but the whole time I was there, I didn't see another employee. Good thing they weren't busy.",

That said, well fueled does not necessarily mean well fed when it comes to eating at Shane's.  What I mean by that is, it's a BBQ place obviously but, it's clearly a chain version of the genre.  Nothing at this Shane's or any other location is inherently bad when taken on it's own merits, you just can't start comparing your meal to real BBQ from some local place.  Example.  The pork on my sandwich was plentiful, not fatty and fairly moist.  But, if I'm looking for any bark or trying to taste any smoke flavor I will be left wanting.  While I did not try them this visit, I do think Shane's does a better job on ribs than anything else so would assume that holds True at this location.

We usually go there for lunch about once every other week and get the Big Dad sandwich.  The Big Dad is a HUGE mound of shredded pork on two pieces of Texas toast.  The pork shadows the thick toast.  Then you can add whatever sort of BBQ sauce, if any, you want.  Spicy for me, please!  Or hot.  I can't tell the difference between their Spicy and Hot sauce, so I just mix them together.  With the combo I get, I can pick whatever side I want.  I've tried the fries, mac & cheese, and their new fried okra.  All are good, but you get more fries than the others so it can be a better value if you're especially hungry.    Today I tried their chicken fingers because they had a special of 3 chicken fingers, fries, and a drink of only $5.  Score!   For a place whose specialty is BBQ and not chicken fingers/wings, their fingers were amazing.  Each one was thick and meaty.  Then they roll them in your choice of sauce.  I got hot, of course, and it was amazing, too.  Wow.  Such flavorful hot sauce!  Now I'm going to have a tough time deciding between their Big Dad and chicken fingers next time we go...  The theming of Shane's is fun, too, (it's supposed to be like a shack) and the service at this particular location is always top-notch.",

This is going to be a regular lunch spot for me since they have daily specials. For you really picky people, THIS IS A BBQ CHAIN!

The hush puppies are delicious and probably my favorite side. They have really delicious peach sweet tea. I love it!",

I ordered the smoked half chicken with baked beans and macabre and cheese as my sides and my boyfriend got a full slab of ribs with double baked beans. Neither of us ate even half of our food.   To behind the baked beans were completely unseasoned. Other than chopping onions and peppers and throwing them in a pot with canned beans there was no flavor. My macaroni and cheese was so over cooked that there it literally turned to mush when I tried to chew it. The chicken was either smoked for too long or left in the warmer because when chewed it turned into mush. Complete over cooked and disgusting. The ribs tasted more like they were thrown on the grill for coloring and then stuck in the oven.   Even after a night of drinking and coming back to it hotel we both went to bed hungry rather than eating our leftover Shane's BBQ. Suffice it to say we  will not be trying this place ever again. On the plus side the toast was good and our dogs even enjoyed that.",

It's more like a Micky D's of BBQ.   I ordered the chicken sandwich and baked beans. The baked beans were good but the sandwich was a joke. I could have baked chicken breasts in my oven and slathered them with sauce and sold them. That's basically what I got. When I'm thinking of greeting the BBQ chicken I'm thinking its chopped not cubed. The sauces are very runny which made for a pitiful sandwich.....big chunks of chicken and runny sauce.   I'm glad I didn't pay for the meal and I won't recommend going to Shane's.",

It's tender and the chicken is fine chopped. The surprise of the flavor is the smokiness infused in the chicken salad. They also have large burgers that are pretty darn good. The only thing I wish they would add to their menu is a vegetable plate of sides for those times when I don't want a sandwich, wrap or wings.   Oh, one more thing - if you ever want a warm scoop of peach cobbler - this is your place!!",
