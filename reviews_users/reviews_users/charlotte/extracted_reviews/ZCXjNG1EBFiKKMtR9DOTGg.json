I've found some other places to be quite bland and one note, the Pad Thai here is anything but, despite how spicy you request it.  The quality is also excellent whether dine-in or carry out. I finally went in for lunch and for $8 had a small bowl of soup, a spring roll and a large portion on Pad Thai. My dish was vegetarian and delicious with some large pieces of tofu. The chicken and shrimp options are also good here.   It's been a while since I've had any of there other dishes but I've been nothing but impressed!",

Still super friendly and quick, but this time my waitress made several recommendations and pointed me in the correct direction. The rice dishes are really good along with the traditional favorites and curry.",

Another thing was that one of the workers was taking up used plates and utensils. I placed my fork on top of someone else's used fork and plate and the lady & a guy told me to take back my fork cause I would need it for my meal...( the fork touched someone else's used fork and plate...) they didn't offer to get me another fork or anything, they told me to keep it and use it for my meal.....that is just unsanitary..... I lost my appetite right after, so once my food came out, I asked for a Togo box and left...",

Then, I ordered the lunch special pad thai which comes with soup if you're dining in and the soup never came out. However, they redeemed themself with the pad thai. Even though it was lunch, it was clearly enough for two people so I took a few bites and then boxed up the rest to go.   Two meals for $7? Works for me!",

I ordered Pad Thai because it's always the first dish I try when eating at a new Thai spot and the best way to judge if they are authentic or not.  It was drenched, absolutely drenched, in sauce.  I totally agree with another reviewer who said there is BBQ sauce in it because that is all you can taste.  You cannot decipher the different flavors or textures due to the overwhelming flavor and amount of sauce in the dish.  The spring roll and soup were just ok.  The decor is the best part of Thai house sadly.  It's entirely too dark in there.  I was greeted and sat promptly, however, I felt extremely rushed to place my order as two separate waitresses asked me for my order after just settling into my booth.  If I go back, I will order something else for lunch.  I highly recommend trying Mai Thai II near Concord Mills instead of Thai House.  Thai Emerald in Huntersville or Thai Chef in Kannapolis are also better options.",

I didn't take off a star for this because they do have a steamed option and it's my fault I didn't order that one. Good sauce.  I had the Vegetarian Red Curry. Lovely presentation, loaded with veggies (tofu optional), and amazing flavor. I will say that it was very spicy, and I ordered it straight off the menu. \"Normal\" here is spicy. Be warned.  Our service was friendly, but slow. We all received our entrees about five minutes apart, which made for some awkward waiting.  Nice place - would definitely recommend it.",

Chicken and seafoods are always cooked perfectly, tender, juicy, flavorful.  Noodles are just right, jasmine rice always perfect.  Service never fails to be good.  Servers are pleasant, and ready to answer questions about the dishes.  Food comes out quickly, piping hot.  Presentations are beautiful.  We have taken many friends here with us, and everyone has raved about the food.",

The prices definitely cater to the area due to being located near university. Customer service was pretty good up to the point where we get the bill and that took a while since we were a large group of 7 and wanted separate bills. Some other tables went up to pay which took precedent over ours. Didn't really bother me though since we weren't in a hurry.  The food on the other hand was not too shabby!! Got a Thai iced tea, assorted shrimp and veggie tempura and seafood pad Thai. The Thai iced tea was a tad too sweet, and I have a sweet tooth. The tempura variety was definitely on the spot. Delicious, Didn't taste like the Japanese variety, and had lots of flavour. The pad Thai I got was mild, which was exactly what I ordered. It also had tons of different seafood. Got like 4-5 full sized scallops, which was very surprising. Overall food was good, no complaints, but no wow factor.  Definitely a place to come and support if you're a local looking for a change of food. They also have a variety of spicy ness levels!",

Also gave me some ice water and the complimentary soup -- which usually isn't offered with to-go orders.   The spring roll is very small - about three bites - but has decent flavor to start the meal off. The curry was fantastic. I asked for medium and there was a good heat in the dish -- probably more than I wanted, but delicious nonetheless.  A good amount of chicken, potatoes and sauce -- maybe too many onions for my taste. I was hoping for some leftovers, but I ate it all. A great lunch under $10.",

Needless to say, when we moved to NC, it was a priority to find a good Thai restaurant. We tried a few places close to Davidson but the food was barely edible.  We stumbled upon Thai House after our DMV appointment and were pleasantly surprised by the food. We regularly order the Chicken Satay, Pad See Ew, and alternate between the Red, Green, and Yellow Curry. We also really enjoy the Sticky Rice w/ Mango desert. This is the best Thai food we've had in NC so far and our \"go-to\" place. I'm not sure why this place is rated relatively low, but if anybody knows of better Thai food, please let me know!",

Vegetarian friendly like all Thai places.  I wish they had their menu online so I could remember the name of what I had.  I am always excited when I see a vegetarian item on a Thai menu that I haven't seen before, so that's what I got.  Not sure what it was called, but it was grilled eggplant with basil and veggies. I pretty much stopped ordering eggplant at restaurants unless it was deep-fried, because every time I got eggplant grilled, baked, etc., even at white tablecloth places, it was not done and not very good.  But I wanted to see what the Thai take on eggplant was, and it was delicious!!!  Perfectly grilled, and great by itself, but excellent with the basil veggies.  I would still be hesitant about ordering it some place else, but would definitely have it again here.  The main reason I'm not giving this place full stars is that it was kind of pricey.  I mean pricey in general for Thai, but considering that it is the only Thai place in the university area, really pricey.  This kind of upset me, as most college students aren't exactly rolling in the dough yet.  Still, very good.  Recommended for a date or with family.",

Lunch specials include an egg roll and soup with the dish you select. I've had quite a few dishes and now I get pad See ewe everytime. It is delish!    Ive been to thai taste, basil, and a couple other restaurants that offer thai food and this is my fav.   The university location is across the street from the hospital, behind the walgreens. Walking in the artwork is beautiful and all wood. Some tvs, lots of art,  a small bar, plenty of bamboo plants, and an extremely friendly wait staff makes the place very comfortable and casual while keeping it classy.   Be forewarned though, like other Asian restaurants they do shut down for two hours between 2 and 4. The staff eats at this time and if your here during those times you may have to ask for help to pay your check. Still always worth it!!!",

I've gotten almost everything on the menu and it is flavorful and mouth wateringly good.  I hate when Thai food is just spicy and your mouth is just filled with hot instead of the flavor.  Thai House really gives you flavor and spice. Don't get me wrong, I love my food spicy but I want flavor too dang it!!!  I normally get the Chicken Pad Thai (7 stars because it's extra extra spicy) and extra bean sprouts.  (I get them for free because I used to go A LOT but I think they are only $1 extra normally...it's worth it!)  When I want to switch it up, I will get the Tom Kha soup and an order of deep fried spring rolls...SOOOOOO GOOOD!   As for price, I would go for lunch because it's actually pretty cheap like $7.95 or something like that and you get a whole bunch of food. (soup, deep fried spring roll and entree) My Pad Thai is normally $10.95 during dinner time but they give you A LOT, so I justify it by eating it for two meals.    As for the service, you can't get any better.  I ordered my food to go and then went to Maggie Moo's to get yummies and they delivered my food to me while I was at Maggie Moo's!  So NICE!! :)   4 1/2 stars! :)    I miss you Thai House! :)",

These dishes are the staple at every Thai restaurant and if they can't get these dishes right, its highly likely others wont be good. The yellow curry was thick and a little on the bland side. The Pad See Ew, was way too soy sauce tasting. It was all wrong. The pad thai I havent tried, but a friend said it wasn't great. But I can't speak about that.   I haven't tried too many Thai restaurants in Clt, but I hear there are some good ones. I have only had Monsoon, this place and Siam Garden. Siam Garden has been the best. It is in south Charlotte off the 485. They are always consistent and tasty. Their prad prik king is delicious.",

The second time mine had celery in it, which is pretty much one of two vegetables I really dislike.  I dug mine out, but finally gave up as the broth was pretty overwhelming with the celery taste.  (This is just me)..  I had a thai ice tea as well, which also was pretty good.  The service was always decent, the waiters/waitresses aren't very talkative, and they get a little busy at times.  (The place is usually pretty packed).  I can't comment about the other dishes, but I doubt I'll switch over from what I like.  I am betting next time I'm out there I will go back for lunch again.",

I do want to try it for dinner to see how it is different, since I have only experienced the lunch menu.  Pad thai and pad khing are good. The curries are ok but i was expecting more spice. I will chalk that up to me not asking for in more spicy.  Usually, I ask for medium spicy. This has ranged from mild to hot so you're mileage WILL vary I think.  If you want to err on the cautious side you can always order you're dish mild and add in the different spicy condiments that they offer.",

    "text": "Thai cuisine is without a doubt one of my favorite types of restaurants to visit. In most cases the dishes are prepared with spices that are unique to the owner's personal recipes. I believe that spicy Thai dishes are far more healthy for you too.   I was recently in Charlotte, North Carolina and paid a visit to Thai House (University) for dinner. As other reviewers have pointed out, the decor is exceptionally ornate with teak wood carvings and a wait staff dressed in colorful and traditional costumes. Being a resident of South Florida has given me an opportunity to sample many Thai restaurants. I think that the weather must be similar to Bangkok, because each year more and more Thai restaurants seem to open up. Regardless, I was eager to try Thai House. I began with an ice cold Sing-Ha beer and a small bowl of chicken rice soup. The soup was served steaming hot and had a generous amount of chicken that was flavored nicely with celery and cilantro. Yes...cilantro! Not just for making salsa anymore! In other Thai restaurants, I have had this soup with basil or mint, and those are good too. The high temperature allowed the flavors to blend and create a very delightful and flavor rich soup. I was favorably impressed. Next, came my entree, chicken with mixed vegetables & cashews that was served with white jasmine rice. I ordered the dish 4-stars hot expecting that would be an adequate amount of spiciness. Wrong. The dish was in fact spiced with various bell and hot peppers, but no where near the heat index commonly found in other Thai restaurants that I have become accustomed to. Too bad. The reason might be that the locals simply do not prefer more traditional levels of Thai spice, and I understand that. Higher levels of spiciness come from a gradual and acquired level of exploration and comfort. Although it is very possible to overdo it, when you do find your \"heat threshold\" it is hard to accept less for some reason.   My entree was fresh and and presented with cleverly cut carrots in the shape of flower petals. Besides the entree not having much of a spice-kick, the cashews were over cooked, and were too soft. Still, a generous portion by any standard. I usually order dessert, but this night I did not.   The bottom line is I liked Thai House enough to recommend it. After only one visit my review is based on a single entree and soup. In other words, my report deserves more visits than I could provide, but at least it seems like a good choice based on my limited experience and overall impression.   One last thing to consider. Thai House is kind of expensive for restaurants of the shopping center variety. True, I don't pay their rent, and Thai restaurants are not as common as other choices in Charlotte, so it is kind of a novelty. Give it a try, and judge for yourself. It's also a good ambiance for couples and families.",

The only thing I would complain about is how in consistence the food can be. Sometimes the portion is less than it usually is. Also, its often that the padthai is soaked in sauce or there's no sauce. Once it looked like soup... lol  The staff is always friendly. Except this one lady that never smiles and quite rude. But either than that when you order something with duck the waiter would make duck noises! haha   Get a bigger place... cus it gets SO PACKED. That's a sign that they serve good food!",

Finally when I had a meeting in University I jumped at the chance to grab some lunch here.   The Good: The service was incredible fast (scary fast), efficient and friendly. Water glasses were kept full and I felt welcomed at all times. The restaurant, albeit a bit dark, was quite clean and definitely crowded for the lunch rush (always a good sign). Prices were affordable and spot on for the Thai fare offered.   The Meh: My Pad See Ew was just ok. It had a nice spice to it (I asked for spice level three) but it was lacking in noodles. And it's a noodle dish. Maybe I just got the runt of the pad see ew litter, but there was twice as much chicken as noodles. Taste wise it was fine but nothing to really write home about.   As for the gratis sweet & sour soup that comes at the beginning of the meal - frankly I'm never a fan of that soup in general, so it's not so fair to judge it here.   Overall it was a fine meal, but I'm not rushing back to Thai House. If I find myself hankering for pad thai or curry while rolling around University, I'd definitely give it another go.",

First time ordered green curry chicken, without bell peppers, which I'm allergic to. It came with bell peppers, which I picked out. Pretty good, though.   Second time ordered pad thai, and it was done well - noodles cooked well, with a nice balance of the other ingredients.   But went last night and ordered duck panang, which was a huge disappointment.  First, it's not suppose to have bell peppers, but apparently they add them to everything, second, which knocked off a star, the \"duck\" was actually a large, frozen-then-deep-fried kind of duck roll - little pieces of duck surrounded in pastry and plopped on a separate plate. It was awful.   There was a duck special on the menu that night, and a friend ordered that. It had real duck. Huh? They couldn't have mixed in a little fresh duck in my dish, but went to the nasty duck roll?",

Prices are pretty high by my standards but not so much by CLT's - a dollar or two more a dinner entree than, say, Monsoon or Viet-Thai.  But let's be honest, Kids, this is white-i-fied Thai.  As in - sweeeeeet to an extreme and no 5 on the heat scale. Or even a 4. They kinda hit 3 when we got our curry \"Thai hot\" and, well, ya.  Pepper plate at every table was a nice touch - most of the time you need to request it. Presentation was lovely - our papaya salad came out on a cross between a cake stand and a hot pot, neeeet (note to veggies - it swims in fish sauce, so make your choice). But if you're me, and obsessive about curry, it's gotta be stellar to earn the stars. And while TH's has a great variety of vegetable matter it lacks a deepness of flavor and that all important punch of heat it needs to transcend.    Still, not a bad spot for a casual dinner or even a date. Just don't come expecting a perfect, traditional plate of curry (which I did, and was). And stay away from the noodles unless you like things dessert-sweet.",

Don't recall what they are called to be exact.. but eggplant dish was on point. It wasn't a mushy or hard.. perfectly cooked and seasoned/sauced. Only thing is, i wish it was tad bit spicier.. but I'll take it.  The wait staff was nice and friendly. We got white rice and wanted brown and they changed it without any argument.   The restaurant decor was interesting. None of Thai restaurant I had was like that. Not saying if it's better or worse but different environment.",

First and foremost, we had 7 people in our party, and given that we didn't plan ahead, we caked 10 minutes in advance to warn the staff. When we showed up, the serving staff was super friendly and showed us to our table immediately.   Soup and a spring roll come with all lunch entrees, and the soup was served to everyone at our table before we even ordered. The excellent service continued throughout our entire dining experience; nobody's drinks went unfilled, and the restaurant was pretty crowded.   I had the Pad Kapraw with chicken and it was delicious. The serving sizes are huge, so plan to come hungry and/or take home leftovers (always a plus in my book). Already looking forward to our next trip here!",

Depends on the day and how busy they are I guess. I will say one time when I was waiting a long time, they brought me a bowl of soup but I didn't really eat it because it was quite bland.  The pad thai is good. I wouldn't say it is the best in Charlotte but definitely worth eating again. They give you a big serving and you get your money's worth for sure. My only gripe is no matter how spicy I ask for it is never spicy. I often ask for \"thai spicy\" and don't get extra spice. I would love if they would put extra dried pepper on the side but it is struggle getting that. But other than that they are very accommodating. A coworker asked for extra sauce and boy did they lay it on her and while I was like what is that, she was very happy with the amount of extra sauce.  The veggie eggrolls included in the lunch specials are actually not so bad. And their curry is quite flavorful. But I would probably pass on the pad see ewe as it was not to my liking - mostly blah and not so delicious.",

They were sitting down feasting before closing time, not the best business approach. They were clearly not happy about my bf and me walking in as they thought we were here for a sit down meal. The attitude changed when I told them I was here for pick up.   I paid about $11-12 for a generously portioned pad kee mow.

I am a big fan of the Pad See Ewe; the big chunks of beef, seasoned with thick noodles, and the perfect balance of broccoli and  scrambled egg, make this one of my favorite meals. The taste, the mouth feel all combine to create a very enjoyable eating experience, not to mention the copious servings.  The Pad Thai with shrimp is very good also.  Thai House's lunch specials are really hard to beat, and whether you are dining in or taking out the service here is quick and courteous.  The restaurant is clean, with high ceilings and beautiful Thai wood carvings on the wall and as part of the central cashier station in the middle of the restaurant.  Great tasting Thai food, affordable prices, pleasant relaxing, Asian ambiance, Thai House is a winner.",

The menu is cheaper for lunches, most places in Charlotte will have lunch specials, the atmosphere is cool, very cultural. It's a very nice place for a date. They also have TVs set up, although I'm not sure that they actually show any special events, like a fight or a specific game. The food is why you want to come here. Try the padkee mao, pad Thai of coarse, any of the noodle dishes you can't go wrong! Curry is very decent. I came here almost once a month and maybe once was the service mediocre. Service is great but when you get annoying first timers they really screw up the service timing, especially when you get big groups, they are 99% time clueless. I seen it. Anyways save yourself some trouble you want good Thai food in Charlotte, this is the place.",

I am in a very committed relationship with this place because the food is divine. I called for takeout the other night and called 10+ times and no one picked up. It was a normal day and it had to be open. I'm still going to give it 5 stars though, because I have been coming here for years and have yet to find a Thai place on a higher level than here. The duck is key, the coconut soup is key, and the Pad Thai will always be key. Their Thai tea is the best, no argument there. If you like fish, get the fish in the chili sauce. Prices always range, but it's worth it. The shrimp wrapped in rice paper and chicken skewers are delicious appetizers also! The Yum Neur is a delicious steak salad and I highly recommend. Overall delicious! Service can be slow but it's worth it for good food.",

They count children/babies as adults when charging for gratuity which is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. How I'm the world does a 2 year old count as an adult.

With quite a few options in the plaza I saw a very small but nicely decorated Thai place and I just lost it. I've been looking for a good Thai place ever since I moved here and so far I've been disappointed with the Thai Basils of the city. Tucked inside a nice plaza near university, Thai House is a really nice family owned place that packs a ton of culture and flavor into their venue and food.   Food & Alcohol:  Started off with the Singha beer and proceeded to order the Yellow Curry, my favorite Thai dish. The sauce was just perfect and the potatoes and onions were cooked to perfection. It went well with the rice and I literally cleaned the bowl. I ordered with the pork which was alright, I felt it needed some seasoning but overall it was a great meal. My friends ordered the Pad Thai and some carnivore paradise of a meal with a ton of beef, garlic, and onions which were both delicious.  Venue: Very very very nice venue. It doesn't have a distinct smell you may find in some Asian influence restaurants, it's extremely clean, the decor is lively, and is spacious. They have a nice little bar in the back of the room which must be for looks because it doesn't seem like anyone would want to be there. Overall a nice atmosphere with plenty of customers.  Service: Quick and friendly service. You can tell they take great pride and care of their establishment as it is family owned. Couldn't be happier.  Overall: Will be back again as it trumps any Thai place I've tried so far in Charlotte.",

The fried rice and the egg roll were both very good, but the chicken was very dry and extremely over-battered. As I was eating, I was literally thinking, \"Man, I wish I had gone to Thai House.\" I eat there on average once a month. I remember there was exactly one time that their sweet-and-sour chicken wasn't up to par, but even then, it was far better than what I ate yesterday. It's easy to take places you love for granted, but I just wanted to mention again how much I love Thai House.",

    "text": "My go-to for Thai food. They've always been consistent every time I get food there.  I typically always get their chicken pad thai, and or sometimes their red curry.  I have yet to find a pad thai that is better than theirs.   From my understanding, there are two styles that can be made.  I've had both, but I was never sure which was which because they don't usually ask you.  One dish would be redder in color, and the other more brownish.  I would assume the brownish color is due to the tamarind, and that this style would be more authentic.  Regardless, I love the 'authentic' version. I don't like the redder version because it has a ketchup-y taste to it.  I do not know if the 'authentic' version I'm referring to is the Thai or Signature version, so you should ask before ordering.    Note: You should dine in for this experience because being able to eat your food as fresh as can be, is always the way to go.  :)  Their golden shrimp is delicious but pricey. Their tom yum soup can be really spicy, but delicious nonetheless. They have stir-fry dishes that you can't go wrong with because they're delicious too.    Honestly, everything that I've tried was all delicious. Lettuce wraps, larb, mango with sticky rice (though they never really have sticky rice on hand), etc.. They just know how to make really good food!  Their Thai tea quenches your thirst, so it's always nice to drink that on a hot summer day.    We come in so often that they recognize us. The waiters are super friendly.  Just treat them with respect, and they'll do the same.  Understand that they work from morning 'till night, everyday on repeat, so cut them some slack.    TL;DR: This place is legit, why go anywhere else?",

They may charge your disinfectant smell ice water as a coke.  2. Be attention to whether they have served you all the food you ordered. For example, they didn't  serve me the soup in the combo until I asked a waiter to do it.  3. Be attention if you are a uncc student and you want to get a uncc discount. This place is the only one that asks all the guests to provide the uncc id to get a discount. So you should be attention that if you want to get the discount, remember to ask all your friends to bring the uncc id with them.  Overall, if you can't live without curry, you have to come here because they have the best curry in the area. However, if you can live without curry, my suggestion is to avoid this place.",

    "text": "Let's start by bottom lining it:  it's good food, authentic Thai but nothing \"exceptional\" and as other reviewers have noted, it's expensive for Thai.  The woodwork is beautiful.  I disagree with the reviewer who though the decor was cheesy.  I've spent plenty of time in Thailand and the carved woodwork is very authentic.  The service was quirky.  Everyone was very kind, smiling and eager to please... but not really around that much.  It wasn't really slow exactly; it was just a little \"odd\" somehow.  Again, very sweet staff, just a little scarce.  The food:  I had my old stand-by Red Curry Chicken and it was good.  I've taken to ordering my food at That restaurants I don't know as \"mild\" and then asking for the Fish Sauce with Chili's to spice it up.  Their fish sauce chili was fresh and authentic.  The curry was very good.  Chicken was tender and not overcooked, as can too often be the case.  I also had the \"Tod Mon\" appetizer which was actually VERY good.  Tod Mon (actually Tod Mon Pla) is a \"fish cake\" which if you haven't tried them before might not sound that good.  They are very nice. Served with a sweet-spicy cucumber and crushed peanut dipping sauce, they were really good, and their sauce was unique, having larger chunks of cucumber than I usually see. (If you go somewhere and see Tod Mon Goong; that's the same thing with shrimp instead of fish and that is really delicious.)  As I said about Monsoon Thai, I felt somehow disappointed in general.  I just don't like spending north of $20 bucks for a Thai appetizer and entree.  My favorite Thai places are usually small, \"mom & pop\" type places, rather inexpensive with awesome food.  So while the food was definitely good, and I would order both items again, it just irks me that they charge so much here. I'm NOT saying that \"$20 bucks is expensive;just that it seems expensive for Thai food compared to what I'm used to.)  Having just relocated from Nashville where I had several really awesome places with excellent food and very inexpensive prices, I don't like, as other reviewers have commented, paying these prices.  Go.  You won't be disappointed but you'll pay a little more than (I think) you should  PS- My yardstick is a little street vendor at the head of Khao San Road in Bangkok.  I also cook my own Thai which has caused my Thai friends to suggest I open my own restaurant.  I can tell ya - that AIN'T gonna happen.   I just mention it to say, I've had the real deal; made the real deal  and that's what I compare to anything I have at a restaurant here.  I'm still looking for a Thai place \"to die for\" here in Charlotte.  You can be sure I'll post it when I (hopefully) find it.",

We had the spring rolls, Pad Khing, Pad Thai, and Green Curry, all with tofu. Yummy!  I've eaten a lot of Thai food and even cook it sometimes. Thai House gets it right. The service it top notch. They are friendly, polite, and tentative. I really feel like they value their customers. It is decorated beautifully with lots of ornate wood work, they have good taste.  Our family will definitely be back and we will bring out of town guests here as well. Bravo Thai House!",

The red curry chicken was a bit too thick And it doesn't have much favour. like they use too much of cornstarch into it way too thick. The price is a bit pricey to be in university location and maybe is because they are only thai place near by. I know the ingredients doesn't cost that much to make. The papaya salad is way sweet!!. And I did asked to make it more on the sour and more of the thai style but is still sweet. No it doesn't taste like what you would get in NYC or thailand. This place just don't do it for me.",

The interior is nicely decorated - I really felt transported away from Charlotte.  I couldn't tell you if it was authentic or not, but it felt nicely done.  I had the Kang Masaman Curry which was delicious.  At medium heat, it gave just enough numbing to the lips that it was enjoyable and not painful.  My friends also split an order of fried pot stickers which were really good.  Overall, had a good first experience here.  Wish I had found out about this place sooner - The service could use some ramping up (they weren't really busy, but it seemed like our waitress took a while to come check on us and for refills).",

It was my first time being there.Their Thai tea was same as any I've tried but their Thai ice coffee was very good since its difficult to find it in other restaurants. Crispy tofu was also same as any. Their spring roll was pretty good but I have tried better ones. I ordered their chicken and it tasted dried as if its been sitting out for a while. Lets just say, it probably wasn't fresh out the grill.  Overall, the environment is excellent with nice traditional Thai culture/artwork. Plates and napkin was set up ahead and one good thing was they will always give out utensil for each order/entree. This restaurant would have received a 4 star if the chicken wasn't dried.",

The restaurant is designed and decorated as if we were in a Thai restaurant in Thailand, which makes the mood and ambiance so relaxing and much more enjoyable.  Anything on the menu is great, but the pad-see-ew and fried rice (both with chicken) are two of my favorite dishes here. You won't be disappointed with either one! Also get their deep fried egg rolls as an appetizer - so good! Try the Thai iced tea as well - best drink to have there!  Staff are always on point with their service and will provide an exceptional experience. Try it out - you'll want to go back all the time!",

The eggplant was not substituted with the Zucchini and I didn't get the extra side of rice to eat with my entree. I mentioned to the server and she said she would steam some Zucchini and remove the rice from my bill. The issue was that my dish was cooked in a sauce, therefore I asked if the Zucchini be cooked in the sauce as it would have been if the order was correct and I would have been satisfied. She could not fulfill that request. I mentioned to the owner which is the older lady that takes the money and she said I had to take it up with the server.

There is a gazebo looking top on the bar made out of wood that has a lot of detailed carvings.  There is other wood carvings around the place but the one over the bar is the most impressive.  The atmosphere at Thai House is very relaxed and quiet.  Sometimes you can find a coupon on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurants.com&s=8b83bf0ff8b716aae84527dc95577a310f201b166dcca25c8ca3824b15703869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurants.com</a>.  There is a $50 minimum that does not include alcohol.  The last time I used a coupon, I went with only my girlfriend and we ended up getting a lot of food to cover it.  I really enjoyed that because I got to try a lot of different food.    Spring rolls are good but I would like to see some fresh cold spring rolls.  The potstickers are good.  They are different.  They are wrapped in wonton skins.  I was really impressed with the Thai House Salad.  Very light and refreshing.    If your new to Thai food I recommend the Masaman Beef, a great choice here.  If you want something a little different the roasted duck is very good with a solid presentation.    If you want something light you can get the noodle soup (Pho).  I am not sure if this traditional Vietnamese dish is also a Thai dish but it is good, especially if your stomach is a little upset.  Like I said earlier very calm relaxing place to eat.  Sometimes the service is not as good when they are busy.  Weekdays are good.  The staff is very friendly.  When my duck was brought out the waiter was quietly quacking.    By the way, there is no liquor, only beer and wine.",

If you have never had it before, it's a spicy lemon grass based broth with shrimp, mushrooms and tomatoes.  It also has hot chili oil in it, and I think white pepper.  It starts out spicy, but by the time you're at the bottom of the bowl it's downright hot!  But, it's DELICIOUS, so if you like spicy and flavorful food you've got to try it.  I've only had a couple of other dishes here and the standout was crispy duck.  Their presentation is really nice, as well as the food being tasty and the decor really let's you know you're in a Thai restaurant.  The service has always been good the times I've been.  The prices are about middle of the road, in my book.  I would not say they're cheap, , but the quality of the food is really high, so I don't mind paying a bit more for a great meal.  People go here in jeans and t-shirts, but it is a really nicely decorated place with good atmosphere, so I wouldn't rule it out if you're looking for someplace for a nice dinner outing.",

One guest gets orange wedges with their food, the other none for the same dish. This is unfortunate because this pace has been a staple in the university area.

As a former chef with thai and other southeast asian country food skill sets and techniques, i would highly recommend this place. It's as authentic as it can get. In terms of food and flavor, it's a 5 star restaurant with a 3-4 star pricing. The only thing missing from a 5 star from me is a 98% sanitation rating or higher.",

We were greeted right as we walked in and seated very quickly. I don't eat Thai often, so I was indecisive and confused when looking over the large menu. Alas, I found the tom yum soup to order, and added a large bowl of rice for $3. We also ordered the fried squid appetizer, pad Thai, and barbecue duck. The food was delicious, but came out in a very weird order. They all came out at different times, and my soup entree came out before the appetizer did. If I could critique something, it would be the order the food comes out: appetizer first, then everyone's meal at the same time, so one person isn't eating before or waiting for the other dishes. Price wise, I think most dishes are around $13 and up, and they do have lunch specials!",

I had to explain to the woman on the phone that I wanted my Pad See-Ewe with only tofu, noodles, broccoli, and egg (none of the other 500 random vegetables they decide to add for the vegetarian version of this dish). This has never been a problem before, but I had to explain it 4-5 times on the phone because she didn't understand what I was saying. When I showed up to get my food, the cashier walked into the kitchen with my credit card and disappeared for 5 minutes, then took another 5 minutes to swipe my card and give me my receipt because she was too busy helping somebody who never got his food. When I got home, I opened my takeout box and my order was incorrect. I hope they can fix this by the next time I order.",

    "text": "My friend just returned from a two week stay In Thailand. After seeing the food posts from her travels, the first place for lunch that came to mind when she returned was Thai House.  We used to work in Fort Mill, SC and frequented the location in Pineville and was always satisfied.  What we didn't know is how different the food is at this location. It was NOT good.  Upon being seated, you're automatically served a small bowl of rice soup and veggies. The broth was a tad salty but overall, It was good for a cold rainy day. We both ordered pad se ewe which is stir fried rice noodles. What came out looked and smelled delicious but was not what we're accustomed to from the Pineville location. Pad se ewe should be thick glutinous rice noodles with some sweetness. The dish served to us was thin rice paper-like noodles that was way too salty and no sweetness at all. I had tofu with my dish. The tofu should be freshly fried separately prior to being added to the stir fry so It maintains a somewhat crunchy exterior. The tofu in my dish was soft and soggy. No crispiness to speak of. It seemed like the noodles absorbed all of the flavor while the rest of the stir fry was bland. I ate my meal while listening to my friend talk about her travel experience to Thailand but after the meal, she made the same comments about her dish that I was thinking about mine. I'm not sure why the taste is so different from the other location but It was bad enough that we will not be returning.",

Me and my lady visited a week or so ago but I'm just now getting around to the review and man if you haven't been here yet you are missing out! First, our waiter was very nice and accommodating and checked on us periodically throughout our meal and never let our waters run low (excellent if you order a spicy dish). The overall ambience of the place is laid back with your standard booths, tables, and bar seats. Traditional Thai art adorned the walls and near the bar area and the lights were dim but not too dark. Now to the good stuff, the food. That's what you read Yelp reviews for anyway right? For starters my lady and I split the som tum famous Thai salad. It features shredded green papaya, tomatoes, green beans, and lettuce, topped with a ground peanut hot and sour mix as a dressing. Let me tell you folks with a hefty appetite, split this dish. It's a huge salad and for only $7.95 it's a great deal. Next the main dish. I ordered the red curry chicken with brown rice and I was more than satisfied. The flavor was supreme and the chicken was a great compliment to the basil, bamboo shoots, green peas, bell peppers and coconut milk. If anything I would want and even more spicy/coconut flavor. So much food remained I even ordered a to go container of brown rice and had leftover Thai for lunch the next day. If you ever find yourself in the university area I suggest you give them a shot. You won't be disappointed.",

Our favorite part now is that the same staff still works here and even though we only get the chance to come in once or twice a year they still remember us and what we like. If you want good Thai food, nice atmosphere, and very friendly staff come here.",

While I think the food is pretty good, I pretty much order the same thing every time I come: Pad kee mow (thai style) and Som tom (papaya salad). I have had these at other Thai restaurants around Charlotte and out of state and nothing comes close to those here. The service is always fantastic! They make you feel so welcome and are always friendly and accommodating. Definitely a must try!",

    "text": "Came here a few nights ago for the first time for dinner in a party of 4 adults and 2 kids and was seated immediately.  The decor was beautiful. The dark wood and sculptures were very pretty. Only concern were the dust collecting on the light fixtures and rods & pipes above us. And also, when our food came, it wasn't too pleasant to see the DIY network come on the TV above us of ppl cleaning bathrooms.  It didn't take too long for our waitress to get us our drinks but she never offered a booster or high chair for our kids, she hasn't even offered drinks to them and never gave them water or silverware either.  The food took awhile to get to us, but good food doesn't come fast. If I wanted fast food, I'd go to a drive-thru right? Our food came out in very different times and my husband's duck panang came last while everyone was close to being halfway done with their food. The food was delicious though. The best Thai food I've had since moving to the carolinas. Food concerns were the spice levels. I ordered the pad lee mow and my husband had the duck panang, both in mild, both very delicious but my husband's curry was very spicy, while mine had no spice at all. Also, our waters were not refilled until after we were done with our food. We weren't offered a box for our leftovers either.  I'll definitely come back but next time I'm in town, I'll just order take out.",

    "text": "Some friends and I were in town for the weekend and we tried Thai House on a whim, even though the reviews were so-so.  We went for lunch at around 1:30 on a Saturday and were immediately seated.  Our booth was roomy, and the decor was a little more festive than other Thai places I've been to. Our service was good - the waiter was very nice and kept my glass filled, so no complaints here.  We each ordered lunch specials, which come with a spring roll and soup. The soup didn't do much for me - I assumed (which is my fault) that it would be a creamy tom kha-type soup, but what we got instead was vegetables in a clear broth. The soup wasn't bad by any means, it just wasn't great. I could take it or leave it. The spring roll was good, though. Crispy, not too greasy, meatless filling.  I can't speak for what my companions had, but I ordered the Pad Krapraw with chicken and it was pretty tasty. I'd give it 3.5 stars. At Thai restaurants I haven't been to before, I always get medium spice instead of hot just in case it's a place that is generous with the chili peppers, and I'm glad I did here because the medium was quite hot. Not, like, blisters on the insides of my cheek hot or anything, but it wasn't a medium. I'm okay with that though, since I like my food on the kicky side. The rest of the dish was perfectly spiced too - you could tell the basil and onions were there, but they didn't overwhelm the dish.   This was the third day in a row I'd had Thai food (I was on a kick, okay?), and even on top of that, this place was still good. So overall, four stars for me. I'd go again the next time I came to Charlotte.",

I was quickly seated, the servers were really nice, I received my food quickly, and my water was always full.    I wasn't happy with the flavor and taste of the food.   I got the traditional Pad Thai and it had way too much sauce on it.  There was no egg that came with it and the flavor was way too sweet.   The noodles were good fine.  I found the flavor to be just so-so.  I ordered a 3.5 on the spicy level and that was perfect for me....had some kick, but my mouth was not burning.

I was not a fan of the sauce, it was bright orange looking.  I came during lunch and orders the green curry with brown rice.  The curry was extra spicy, but what I found interesting was the green curry was not on the lunch menu.  Not an issue that's what I wanted so I'll pay the full 14.95.  What was interesting is the portion was definitely a lunch size portion.  If that was the dinner portion I'm certainly disappointed.  I'll keep looking for other Good Thai restaurants... personally was not impressed and I've had Thai food in several cities and in Japan  and I must say I'm least impressed with this one.",

The staff is generally very, very friendly. I think the food is okay, but I've had better Thai food.   I had the Shrimp Pad Thai which came with the teeny, tiny shrimp that look like they came frozen from a bag in a supermarket (losing major cool points for this) and it was just okay, I didn't finish my meal. My noodles were super soggy and DROWNED in sauce.... making the dish almost SOUPY. I was not impressed at all. I also tried one of their curry dishes with pineapple, and that was a bit better.   They have specials from 12-3, so the price is decent when eating here. The space is pretty and it's not too loud of rowdy in here. But I think the kitchen could improve a bit.",

They have specials every day and my selection, Pineapple Curry, was deliciousness on a Friday afternoon. My choice of meat was chicken, cooked in red curry sauce, coconut milk, tomatoes, bell pepper, and basil leaves, served over white rice. My spice level (on a scale of 1-5) was a 3. That was just enough to hit me but not make me breathe harder. I savored every spoonful of the delicious creamy sauce. I think I liked it best! I was excited to learn this dish is served daily. When the feeling hits me, I can order ahead and pick it up, although eating in is always the best option. I can't wait to return for another serving of Pineapple Curry.",

Love the flavor and portion of the meal. I am able to get two meals out of it. Loved the appetizers as well. The potstickers are fresh and tasty. My teen enjoyed her meal as well.

They used to fill it with all kinds of seafood and egg and the tomato normally was a wedge now it's slices in it which is less pleasant.

    "text": "The guys and I stopped in here while on a business trip to Charlotte, North Carolina. One of my buds said he never had Thai before and that sealed the deal. Thai House is a lovely restaurant (in a business strip) that seems deceivingly small from the outside, but is very deep with lots of tables and booths. The staff were all very friendly and helpful throughout our entire visit.   Dave had some questions about what he should order, given he had never tried Thai before. I explained their dishes were savory with sweet flares of mango or pineapple, if he wished. They also use plenty of crisp vegetables and many dishes have peanuts. Also, he would have the option of thinner or thicker sauces, depending on what he was in the mood for. The server was also very helpful with any questions he had regarding specific items on the menu. In the end, he chose a chicken with fried pineapple rice dish and we shared a fried pot sticker appetizer. I went with the Panang Duck. (Super boring George got a plain coffee cuz he already ate some crappy airport food. Hahaha!)  Dave really enjoyed the meal and was so happy he finally tried Thai food. My duck was fantastic with very little cartilage or bone to worry about. The appetizer was tasty, but I think I would've liked the non-fried version a little more. Cutting each piece open and dipping it in the sauce increased its tastiness for certain. (Oh and I suppose George enjoyed his hot brown water, but I didn't ask...   ; -P  Overall, we had a great experience at Thai House. If you are in the area and enjoy Thai food, I highly recommend this restaurant for their expansive menu, their gracious hosts, and their fantastic food.  Thank you for reading my review!",

Well wouldn't you know what I said got me ignored, no water or anything. She just kept answering the phone taking every order via phone but mine as I sat in front of her. She disappeared into the back and was MISSING IN ACTION.  I ended up taking a table and next thing I know a lovely waitress shows up.  She asked for my drink order and since I waited so long at the counter I went ahead and placed my order. I order Tom Kha and Squid Tempura and both were off the charts amazing. The food alone is the reason why I have them the rating that I did. I will be back but will not go to the counter unless I am placing a to go order.",

You have to mix the entire plate including pepper and sugar in order to get the full taste! They also gave us a chicken soup appetizer which was also pretty good. The waitresses and waiters were nice, but we were being waited on by like 3 different people ..? I didn't mind it much though, just confusing. The pricing wasn't too bad either. For really good thai food, it was pretty cheap! Oh and if you can't find parking right in front of the restaurant, there's a whole big parking deck behind and on top where you can take the stairs or elevator.",

Try the green curry, pad kee mow, pad thai, thai iced tea/thai iced coffee -Fast service and polite staff -Ambiance is superb. Most other asian restaurants in the area have no thematic decor/ambient lighting/music -Wait staff have interesting traditional uniforms -Outstanding Groupon/restaurants.com deals  Cons:  -Parking is a pain in that town center. -Certain servers have thick accents. -Speed is inconsistent.  Sometimes entrees come out before appetizers. -Easy to rack up a big bill here.  Bills are comparable to Basil in uptown... but this area is University.",

The soup had veggies and rice in a clear broth and was simple but perfect to tide me over until my entree arrived. I also got a Thai iced tea which was a bit sweet but overall filled my craving. Service was polite but not super friendly. Overall a good experience.",

    "text": "I've had three different experiences at the Thai House.  My first was our office holiday luncheon.  We were seated way in the back corner of the restaurant.  The food was so-so and the service was the same, I think because we had such a large group.    The second time was a two-person lunch meeting.  The service was much better, the experience better, and I got a different impression of the Thai House (especially sitting more in the highly decorated center of the room).    Based on the 2nd experience, I went there for dinner one evening with a friend of mine.  The food was a lot more pricier at night, the food average, and the service slow (when the restaurant wasn't even busy) but rushed to get you out of there once you were finished, if that makes any sense.   So after three experiences (one good, two bad), I've had to determine that I can find better Thai places around town.  I will give them credit for their decor inside, though.  They're in a strip mall, but they've managed to give it that Thai feel as you walk in the door.",

The atmosphere of the restaurant was great though and everyone seemed very friendly.  I'm going to give them another try.

I first came here from my love of the Thai House in Pineville, so when I found there was one closer to me after I moved I was ecstatic! I've been going here now for the past 12 years and they are consistently delicious every time! From the open of the door to the close of the door, your experience here will be fantastic! The staff is super friendly and attentive. Each dish I've tried has been artistically prepared and tasted fantastic! The servings are large and definitely worth the cost-which is totally reasonable in the first place. When they speak of their ambiance and Thai artwork, they're not kidding-the woodwork will astound you and I'm jealous it's not in my own house! As a plus, they have a little patio you can sit outside on during nice weather-I used to bring my dog up there quite a bit and they never complained and always brought a water bowl for her. I can't speak more highly of them, they are truly a favorite restaurant of mine and when I move in the future, I will be making a point to drive out of my way to go here. Even now, there are closer Thai restaurants to us than them, but I refuse to eat any other Thai than theirs, b/c it just won't compare! Just be careful to know the difference between American-spicy and Thai-spicy (which they'll warn you anyways)!",

Fried spring rolls for appetizer tasted good but the sweet and sour sauce that came with it was too sweet. We always get Pad Thai everytime we are in a Thai restaurant. That has become one of my basis to initially gauge what has yet to come. And it tasted alright although it was on the border of being too sweet. The green curry was a delight! Light creamy sauce and a bit spicy. You should try it. We also had the King and I, shrimp in a sweet and salty sauce with brocolli, red and green onions. It was good but not my favorite. So far, this is my favorite of all Thai restaurants we've ever been. Will come back to sample more dishes.",

I usually get the deep-fried veggie spring rolls, which are the best that I've ever tasted. I have tried to find other spring rolls that are equivalent or better but after hundreds of spring rolls tried, I still have yet to find any. The vegetable tempura is also a favorite. As far as main courses go, I usually get the vegetarian Rad Nar. Its a mix of thick chewy (but not in a bad way) wide rice noodles, veggies and tofu in a brown sauce. Again, I've never found anything comparable. Especially if you drizzle some of the brown sauce over some white rice. DELICIOUS. Their Thai iced tea is also pretty good- sweet, creamy and delicious. This is one of several places in Charlotte that I would be devastated over if they were to close completely. I couldn't imagine a world without my spring rolls and Rad Nar.",

We were a table of 6 and seated right in front of the cashier, so I'm sure they were aware we were there. However, we didn't get any service until repeated attempts to gain one of the multiple servers attention. Once we finally got service the server was extremely rude and rushing us to order. One person was not ready so he said \"never mind, I'll come back later\" and I was not happy. I told him there were other people ready to order. He saw I had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> coupon and he immediately grabs the Brunch menus out of our hands and says \"Coupon is only for dinner.\" I said, \"the coupon does not say that, but that is fine, we will not use it.\" He still continues to try to get us to order off the dinner menu when I say excuse me, no. He finally gives us back the brunch menu and tries to again walk away when I said please stop, we are ready to order. He asks if everyone wants water, which I instantly reply \"no\" and he takes those orders. Once one person is done with a number on the brunch item he walks away, even though they aren't done ordering. I have to tell him to stop and slow down several times during the order process. After we are done ordering he asks for the drink orders again and I was just upset at that point. My Mom ordered hot water and when they brought the drinks out, they put them on the edge of the table and said \"pass it down\". No hot water. I asked three different people and we received the water after we receive the brunch, which they again, left on the edge of the table for us to pass down to each other. After our brunch is served, they serve our appetizers.  With that type of service, if they actually let me use my coupon, I still would never come back.",

The coconut broth was decent but nothing to write home about.  I would eat here in again when I am in town but would love to find something even more delicious.  Service was good in some respects, the servers were kind and friendly but they way they laid my plates down was like someone passing a baton in a relay race. They would whizz by and just drop a bowl of something on my table without a word or without pausing to check if I needed something.

The panang duck was tasty as well - nice thing about duck is it is fattier than chicken so can take some overcooking, and I think mine was a bit over. It was complimented by plentiful broccoli, carrots, and snow peas. The sauce had a good level of heat for me - which is to say, spicy but not too spicy. I asked for 2 on their 4 star heat scale.  The prices are a bit higher than I find in Winston-Salem, but the restaurant is between the Carolina Medical Center and UNCC so I would expect to pay more and the portions are generous.

    "text": "Food is definitely a plus. Interior just keeps you spellbound. The two out of the 3 most important factors for a restaurant(Ambience, food and service) deserves some appreciation.  The Tom yum soup is good not great. Fried tofu dish brings out an interesting texture to the tofu. It does taste good as well. These guys need to take It easy on peanuts. They are little too over bearing when it comes to their peanuts. The pad Thai had crunch in every bite.   The tofu mastaman curry is definitely something I would order the next time I drop by here. Basil fried rice is better off being called as just fried rice.  The staff courtesy seems blatantly artificial. We were ignored to be seated for about 10 minutes. We were party of 5 and there is no way they would miss seeing us.   Bottom line: Good food. Tastefully done decor. Staff need a reality check.",

I placed my order over the phone to go for Basil Fried rice and Fresh Summer rolls with tofu. It was about a 30 minute wait all together and 30 minutes before closing on a Thursday there was still a pretty good crowd of people. The staff  was  pleasent.  My food was tasty. I enjoyed my basil fried rice with chicken. I did not use the spicy sauce that came with it and it still had a little kick to it. The summer rolls were also good and bigger than other restaurants I have been to.   I would suggest if you like soy sauce ask for extra if you have a to go order they only give you 1 pack.",

Every dish that I've had here has been amazing.   Tonight I ordered the Gulf of Siam which has sauteed  with roasted chili paste, carrot, green onion, bell pepper, ginger, broccoli, and basil leaves. You can choose the meat to either be shrimp, squid, mussels, or seafood combination. Also I had the iced tea which is infused with jasmine.   The only con that I would say about Thai House is that they're understaffed in my opinion. It's always crowded, which also shows their food is great but I need them to possibly gain a few more waiters/waitresses.  Other than that if you're in the University Area come check this place out.",

Tip, order a bunch of stuff then share it with your friends/family because each plate comes with aloot. Thai tea- hands down the best Thai tea I've had! The dishes we normally get are the Whole Fried red snapper, in chile sauce. Omg it's so good, worth the extra $$ I promise! ORDER THE BASIL FRIED RICE, You will not be disappointed my friend!! My family absolutely loves their Shrimp Tom Yum soup in the hot pot, it's good but it's honestly a little too spicy for me lol! So if your a lover for spicy food, I defffinalty recommend that. I really love coming here, atmosphere is nice & the place is super clean too and I don't think we ever had to wait for a table- hurrah! (;",

Few days back we took our friends to this place for lunch. We ordered few lunch special items. On one dish our friend asked for just a bit more beansprout, guess what, a waitress guy declined the request by stating that they already put extra. He offered small side of sprout, and it'd cost $3.  One other dish, the noodle was burnt, and he told that how it cooked. We quickly finished with the other decent dishes we could eat and left.

We ordered from the very stoic waitress (we usually have great service but she had the grating demeanor of an annoyed teenager). My husband decides to go to the bathroom only to be greeted by a few cockroaches running around the stall.  Now, I have worked in restaurants, I know they aren't hermetically sealed and bugs get in. But even a few German cockroaches (the small reddish ones) are usually a sign of infestation.   So he goes to the waitress and very quietly and politely (so other patrons are spooked) tells her that there are roaches in the bathroom and that management might want to know. Her response? \"Why?\" What? Why? What do you mean 'why'? Is this an existential question?  She calls management and they start arguing back and forth with my husband standing there. No one acknowledges him, apologizes, anything. So after a few minutes he just lets them know we are cancelling our order and leaving.  So, the possible infestation is a concern but I could always hope they would address it and I would return after a little while. They do have great food. Although, we felt that the way they treated it was not very professional and because of this, we will probably not be back.",

Can you say a mash up between a genie and MC Hammer!  They're awesome!  My dinner was fantastic!  I'm not going to lie...  Any dish can be made veggie friendly and that's exactly what I did with the eggplant something or nother! (Can't remember the name)  Not an single gaggle-member was dissatisfied with their meals.  I can tell by the empty plates!  Plenty of food for decent prices.  Definitely will be going back!  Get the medium if you want a little bit of a kick and if you venture for spicier... Good luck! :)",

I was so thrilled when Thai House said they were opening a location at the EpiCentre - ug that was supposed to be a year ago and havent heard a peep about it since.  Sad Face!!!!  if it was closer I would abandon my staple eats and branch out to try more of the menu.  This location however has gorgeous interior and the wait staff is so courteous I am thanking them every time I see them.  Thai House please open uptown too!!!  I will be your Number One Customer!!!  :-D",

    "text": "Overall a great experience at the Thai house with my fellow yelpers...everyone loved their dish (and the variety on the menu was huge).  The 'mild' spice had a lot of kick to it and I'd definitely recommend that if you want some zing to your dish, but don't want to leave with your mouth on fire.  The wait staff at first was very attentive and their dress was pretty awesome, some crazy colors for sure!  As the dinner wore on, I think our waiter forgot our table existed, another waiter, after almost 30 min realized we had never received our check and promptly brought it to us - I was beginning to think a free meal was in the making!  Great company, great atmosphere, and great food...a solid 4 star rating from me.",

    "text": "I just went back here after a long \"break\" -- it had probably been at least two years.  Happy to report that the Duck Panang is as delicious as it always has been.  I'm one of those people that goes to a place for a food.  If I want Duck Panang, I go to Thai House, even though they have other things that are good too.  Maybe that's a mistake, but that's how I roll.  Anyway, it's very cute when the waiters bring your Duck Panang to the table inside a little clay duck dish, and quack at you as they deliver it.  This is a good, solid Thai option in the University area.",

I also like the Rad Nar with seafood and the Yellow curry and the penang curry.  You can order spice level 1-4 so they will make it your spice level.  The servers are some of the sweetest and kindest people I have ever met.  I consider them family.  Beautiful souls.  Also the sweet iced tea is great.  They use Jasmine tea and it's perfect.  This place is pure love.",
