It was  a little slow. I'm going to give this location another chance. Maybe they are still working out the kinks. Food was good. Portions are not as big as the Dilworth location. Sweet tea wasn't refilled. Restaurant itself is very clean and organized. Server was friendly. She said every ones your server. Which is a odd greeting to me. Any restaurant you go to has this principle. Servers always help one another out.",

At first, I wasn't too keen on waiting 30 minutes for a table but took that as a good sign of business since they just recently opened. We killed the time taking a lap around the pond. The idea of \"everyone is your server\" makes for a fast-paced customer service setting. Anytime we needed anything it was promptly delivered! The food was great. We both got the stuffed French toast which comes with a side of meat. The cornbread and apple butter pre-meal was delicious! I have no complaints and will definitely be dining here again in the near future.",

For what it's worth, I recommend this as an addition to the menu!   My wife had the Boursin omelette because  she loves that sort of cheese and it was very good with tomato & crumbled bacon in it as well.   They serve cornbread with some sort of homemade chunky applesauce which is really great to spread on the cornbread.",

They told us to sit wherever we wanted. We chose by the window that had a view of the pond. I ordered the New  Yorker and a flapjack. The New Yorker is basically a smoked salmon egg scramble. The flavor was good but the texture was off as it was a little on the dry side. The flapjack was very good. Great texture and tasty. The syrup is fabulous. My wife had the corned beef hash with hollandaise sauce. It was really good. However, nothing comes with it but two eggs. No toast, no other side. I would have expected more for $11. Also, they drowned it in hollandaise sauce. I think we agreed that this place has potential and that we'd try it again. Although we do feel that it's a little bit pricey for what you get. But next time we'll pick other options to validate that.",

Sitting down we had our drink orders taken and were presented with the second best cornbread I've had from a restaurant as a pre-breakfast treat. My meal order was for the oatmeal pancakes with a side of turkey sausage. These were hands down some of the best pancakes I've ever had. Soft, lightly sweet, fluffy. I love pancakes so believe me when I say these are worth a try. The turkey sausage, despite also being deliciously seasoned, was the low point of the meal as it was cold. You could tell they had probably plated the sides before the main course was off the griddle. Perhaps it was because of the large group we had but that doesn't excuse it. There was also some minor confusion with splitting the bill as Famous Toastery uses a group based \"every server is your server\" system, but all in all it was a pleasant experience. Would certainly visit again.",

Being new to the Charlotte area, I'm trying to explore local restaurants, and I knew that I'd be needing a good breakfast/brunch place, especially when family and friends visit. For starters, I was greeted and seated immediately, even at noon on a Saturday. My partner and I were taken to the screened-in patio, where we had a beautiful view of the water, fountains, ducks, and people riding paddle boats. It was incredibly relaxing and great for people watching.   I ordered the strawberry cheesecake stuffed French toast, and I was not disappointed. I couldn't eat fast enough! My partner tried a bite, and he was instantly envious, even though he /loved/ his east coast BLT (which has Brie on it, and I think that's a pretty clever touch).   I did eye the cocktails menu (including many fun and fruity mimosas starting at $6!!!), but I didn't get one this visit. I will definitely update my review once I've tried one (or all of them, which will quickly become my goal). If you can't tell, I'm excited to go back!",

It is thick, sweet cornbread. It is so amazing. I had the southwestern omelette. Let me tell you about the POTATOES!!!!! Holy - they were seasoned to the GODS!!! The seasoning and oils on the potatoes are so amazing.   The only bad part about this location is the wait on a Sunday morning. You will wait an hour so just be patient.  The mimosa I had was amazing. My boyfriend had the rumosa and it was yum too! I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "I can't believe what used to be a bar... Turned into a brunch spot. Has it been that long since I've been in Charlotte? Well, at least north Charlotte? The Famous Toastery is a chain really that's located on the east coast, but this was actually the first time I ever heard of them. This place has been opened since April. When we came through it was quite busy and even though we didn't have any reservations or anything we were seated pretty quickly.   When we were seated, we noticed that every table had a basket of corn bread... But we didn't. So we asked for one and well they were prepping them, so this place made fresh corn bread which was pretty exciting. When we got a basket, it was pretty good.  The food... Something that caught our eyes was the Boursin Omelet, and well that's what we got. I ordered an extra side of bacon, because honestly...who could ever have enough bacon?  All in all I thought the omelet was well cooked and had a good amount of flavor. I think the cheese helped it a lot, and well that cheese was pretty delicious. The bacon I was on the fence on. The potatoes were good, and definitely plentiful. If you come here I have no doubt that you will get full.  One thing to note is that they have a lot of waiters, but getting their attention at times can be trying especially when they're busy. They should have been settled by now, hopefully. I think this place is a great addition to the University area and will definitely see a lot of business considering the location and how perfect it is to just stroll around the pond after the meal. All in all, I will probably come back here if I'm in the area and looking for a brunch spot.",

When I arrived the place was pretty packed, and the hostess let me know she was going to look around for a table. She came back and we were seated. A server came and greeted us and asked had we been there before and we both said no. He then explained on the menu that it states that everyone is your server meaning that many of them will check to see if your doing okay and need anything, sounds good. He went and got our drinkers then took our orders answering any question we had. We both decided to get the Combo with French toast, eggs and bacon but substituted potatoes for the eggs instead after we asked if we could do that. Then that was pretty much it as far as service go with that waiter. He was nice and knowledgeable though which was great. One other server did come up to us to see if we were okay but other than that no one else really came by the table which I felt since \"everyone\" was your server there would be a little more interaction especially once our waters started to get low. Now on to the food. The potatoes were amazing and if I were to come back it would be only for them. And the bacon was good too. The French toast on the other hand was bland and they mind as well have used sandwich bread, I didn't finish it.  Overall the server was good but other than the potatoes the food didn't really impress me.",

    "text": "We went for Father's day Brunch and we were quickly seated so that was nice. We sat down at our table and because they set the tables with menus, we had to wait and ask for a child's menu. If they set the table with menus and you have a child in your party, the hostess should accommodate your needs and supply you with a child's menu. I shouldn't have to ask for it.   So our server asked if we had ever been to a Toastery before and we had not, so she explained that all servers work together and everyone is your server. I thought to myself, \"Oh Cool.\" But that thought changed throughout our meal. There are servers everywhere but no one looks at you directly so getting someone's attention is a cluster  you know what. My man had to eventually get up and ask someone for help because we couldn't get anyone to our table. He did this a couple of times. So please do away with this. I do not get this concept. Or if you are going to stick with this concept, train the servers to smile and do eye contact so that if someone needs help they can get it.  We were going to order off their Brunch Menu Specials for Father's day but they were out of a couple of items. So my question is why have the special menu out? Everything else was on their regular menu. In fact, the eggs benedict I ordered was on the special menu but the server rang me up for what was on their regular menu and it was slightly different but I didn't want to send my food back.  Overall the food was okay. Nothing special. My hollandaise sauce was on point and the potatoes were seasonded fairly well. They don't have a fryer here so they don't offer fries with a hamburger on the child's menu. So we opted for fruit which was mostly cantaloupe. Not very child friendly if you ask me.",

    "text": "Another extension of Toast in Davidson  Business model for Toast in Davidson changed about a year or so ago and rather than an Organic Expansion, they opted to use the franchise model to expand and since then, a number of these have opened in the area. This is one of the newer ones along with Concord Mills and Indian Land SC.  Davidson was nice when it opened and then it because a victim of it's success with long lines, awful wait times and poor service all in cramped conditions.  This is not a review of that store but rather as they have expanded, the newer stores have more room and can accommodate more people. They still have the tiny tables that they did in the original store and with the additional space, should be able to hire more waitstaff and improve service. Unfortunately not the case.  My wife and I went to the location in University Place this past Monday which was July 4th. Walked in and were promptly seated at a small table in the middle of the room but we did not see a server for over 5 minutes. I was ready to leave when one finally showed up.  I will admit from that point on, service did get better. Presented us with menu's and took our beverage orders and after we did place the orders, they did have our meal out within a reasonable length of time.  My wife order a Quiche with a side of fruit. One of her complaints about sides of fruit is that most of them have a few berries on top but the balance is mostly melon and that was the case here. She did indicate that her quiche was very good.  As for myself, on the menu that had three specials each named for a Presidential contender. The Hillary was a salad with West Coast theme, don;t remember what was the Bernie and the Trumplet was an omelet stuffed with meatloaf. Since I like meatloaf, I order the Trumplet.  Please note that because I ordered the Trumplet, in no was is this to be consTrued to mean I am a Trump supporter. If that was the case, I would have been very disappointed because the meatloaf inside the omelet was extremely dry and overcooked with little flavor.  What flavor there was came from the Pico de Gallo served on the side.  All in all, this is one of the better and I hope as the restaurant is there for awhile, it get even better.  Cuisine is creative but preparation is average. Service once you get acknowledged the first time is really not bad and atmosphere is not too back except for the cramped feel from the very time tables all pushed together.",

She did let us sit down before asking for my drink. She never told us her name and never came back to check on us. We ate with no napkins and never had our drinks refilled. She walked passed our table as we had our cups empty and played stacked and said nothing. So I timed her and we sat 15 more minutes and still nothing. It's just like she saw us but did not care. I eventually went to another server and asked am I supposed to get Togo things myself? He was nice and apologized but as for my server. Terrible service. When i told the manager. Manager did not offer anything except explain they were understaffed. I understand understaffed, but if i literally watch my server ignore us and look at us, that's not cool. I will return for my military discount because that was the best part ( 50% ) but probably not to this location.",

The wait was pretty long, but it was a Sunday so I had no problem waiting. You have the option of waiting outside with coffee, which is a very nice option.  After waiting for about twenty minutes, we were seated. Staff were very friendly and there was a nice selection of lunch and breakfast menu items. All the staff members work together to serve you, so if you need something (like a refill on your coffee), it happens quickly.   It didn't take very long for our food to come out and it was quite impressive. My wife got huevos rancheros and I got a runner's omelet. The food was great, but the most surprising part of the experience was that the servers ask if you want coffee and ice water to go. By the way, the quality of the coffee is well above average.  I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Update: Been awhile since my last visit. Had a rough morning and decided to stop in for a carryout breakfast. Ordered the two egg meal for myself and the three egg for my husband. Waited 15 minutes. Paid for my order and headed to work. Settled into my desk to eat and see that there were no hash browns. I said I did not want fruits! My husbands order was complete but they now give you a 1/3 cup of hash browns to go. Wth?! I paid full price for two breakfasts and two coffee coming to $25...what a ripoff.   Previous Review: This is a review for carryout. I saw on Yelp a new and hot place near my job. Was craving a hot breakfast and decided to find this place. Unless you are familiar with this area, you may miss it. It is behind the asian restaurant in the inner court.  The door was a bit difficult to open. It was early in the morning so it felt like a ghost town. Someone finally appeared to welcome me. I asked if I can order carryout. He said yes and walked away. I stood there a bit confused and was not sure if I was to follow or wait. He appeared a short moment later and told me to follow him.  He led me to the register and I placed my order and paid. He left again and did not return until he had my order.   I ordered the 2 eggs breakfast. It comes with potatoes and bread. Additional side is $3.69. I added bacon and total came out to $9 and some change.  It was very good. Large cuts of potatoes that were seasoned differently than I am used to. Very flavorful. Eggs were perfectly cooked. Loved I had option of choosing sliced sourdough. The bacon was not as crispy as I prefer, but I will ask it be cooked that way next time.  Despite some uncomfortable moments walking in and waiting in an empty restaurant, I was happy with my order. It really was a good warm breakfast.   The views from all the windows is just so serene. I may have to bring my kids here and enjoy all the Boardwalk has to offer afterwards.  It's a new place and staff, so it may take a while for their service to improve.",

I pulled up the menu on yelp and decided to call an order in since they always seem to be busy.  After a quick scan, we decided on the shrimp and grits and walked over to wait the 10-15 minutes we were told it would take.  As I expected, they had a wait and we were sent to the bar for pick up.  The wait for our take out wasn't too bad and we were heading out in no time.  The shrimp and grits are not a regular item and was a special that day, but in my opinion it was just ok.  I could look at the dish and could tell the grits were plain instant grits and for anyone that has enjoyed the real deal shrimp and grits in the low country knows the grits can make or break this meal and instant grits will break it every time.  All was not lost as the shrimp portion was pretty good but I will need them to correct this grit situation before I decide whether to return.",

I had a fantastic overlook of a scenic fall pond while dining. Servers were pleasant, attentive and efficient. I had some difficulty making selections as brunch and lunch items are available all day. I tore myself away from the Shrimp & grits to order the house special, 'avocado bennie' -a creative take on Eggs Benedict with a poached egg to order in a baked split avocado and topped with pepper cheese and a very lite dusting of Cajun spice. It was outstanding, though next time I'll ask for hollandaise instead of the cheese. I did substitute grits for the fresh fruit side. Can't be focused on healthy choices while traveling. Bottomless coffee and a glass of fresh squeezed OJ rounded out a perfect start to a beautiful day.",

It's off the boardwalk, so it's a nice place to wait or walk around until you can get seated.   I like that they do team service, so you feel comfortable asking any server when you need something instead of trying to get the attention of your server.  The huevos rancheros are really delicious. I highly recommend them. The stuffed french toast is also worth trying. Get it with a side of bacon or the turkey sausage. They're good about making your eggs exactly as you like them, and I also thought the hash brown potatoes felt really homemade like ones my grandma would make at home.  This place has a homestyle and southern feel. The prices are fair, and the food is all really tasty and fresh.",

It was delicious! scrambled eggs, with spinach, goat cheese, and smoked salmon.  I didn't want the capers and they accommodated.  Every server is your server which is a great little concept.  They staff was very friendly and helpful.  I also tried a pomegranate apple mimosa.  I will have to post the pictures later.  I was extremely happy and can't wait to get back to Charlotte.",

    "text": "God if you could give ZERO stars, this place deserves it most. We waited 45+ minutes for a party of TWO. Fine, it's brunch on Sunday which I can understand a wait. But to then be sat, and be put directly beside the check out line is even more infuriating. People were beside us the whole time we were at our table to check out, which they stood so close we had no room. ( we even moved the table over, which people still stood on top of us.)  Order came out wrong, ordered poached eggs medium, came out super hard. Another meal came out on separate dishes ten minutes apart, which was also super annoying. It's not hard to bring a combo meal out at the same time as the other food. But for whatever reason this place lacks on that side of the spectrum.   We then had ZERO refills on our coke, and coffee. No one ever came back to check on us or see if we needed anything. Or even ask how the meal was. I would have loved refills and to get my poached eggs made correctly but that clearly was too much for them to handle.   We then waited at our table, they bring the bill to the table normally, well shocker if you've been reading, we never got our receipt. We waited about 10 minutes and I had enough of being looked over. So I got in line at the register and get the RUDEST girl to check us out. She must work at the bar because as I complained about how awful everything was, zero refills, never getting our ticket to pay I get a very snarky \"oh well I'm not a server, and our credit card machine has been down.\" She couldn't even have respect to look at me or genuinely apologize for the way our experience was. She then ran my card and then slapped my card and receipt down on the counter like I've done something to her and she has to make an aggressive point at me.   First of all, learn some customer service and some manners. Secondly, when people are paying you for their food and service maybe put a smile on, ESPECIALLY when you guys messed up the whole meal and experience, with zero accountability. Then she doesn't make any eye contact because I've clearly ruined her day with their register being down and their servers sucking and complaining about how awful the experience is, and she looks over me and aggressively asks for the next person to pay their bill.   I will NEVER come back. I will NEVER recommend this location to anyone. I wish I knew the name of this girl, because I would absolutely go to corporate about her. She better watch herself because it's employees like her that ruin restaurants.",

May I say it was worth the detour   At this restaurant your able to set yourself, which is  very awesome to me! We were able to set in the sunroom which faces the water.   They have a cool way of serving their guest by using a team serving style. Where everyone is your server.  They gave us complimentary cornbread! And your from the south you know you love some cornbread lol   The cornbread was sweet and moist. Just melts in your mouth but the apple butter they serve with it took the cake!   I order the Southwest Scrabbler and she ordered the Avocado Benedict. But came out looking very nice. The flavor in both dishes where amazing.",

Went there for a second time because my peers said it's a really nice spot. But it turned out to be a second time  of wasting my time and money. I ordered steak and eggs, the steak was white, the hash browns was more like mashed potatoes, steak sauce was a joke, eggs were still raw and the most ridiculous part was the food being stone cold. It hadn't even been 5 mins since the food was served, it was cold when touched. We asked them to bring us another plate ( it looked like they threw that steak back on the grill and put the plate on microwave) I wouldn't even give that piece of meat to my dog. What a disrespect to food. P.S. that one star is for the service,which was good.",

It started with a customer wanting his sandwich to be fixed the way he asked and wanted. It did not come correct so he asked her to send it back so they can do it right. She asked him if he'd like to do and he said no. Send it back and let them get it right. While walking away, she said, oh he could have put that egg on that sandwich, loud enough for other customers to hear.  So we finally get seated and I ordered a drink which was a little to strong so I asked for a little pineapple juice. The waiter was reaching for my drink and I stopped him and said no, my drink never leaves my sight. Just bring me the pineapple juice please. He says something to the same supervisor and she comes later with the juice and comments that we would never put anything in your drink. I went off on her! She was so unprofessional and now I can't enjoy my meal!! This will be posted everyday on social media by the way!  Her name is Bonnie. Fix your attitude!",

Table in the back lovely view of the pond, nobody on the water but the ducks. Yea ducks!! Finagled the tables around and everyone got situated and beverages requested and corn breaded (apple butter and texas pete make life good). Was having a hard time deciding among the benedicts so I went with the corned beast hash and eggs up. Came out a little more geometric than I expected but still very well executed and the half orange wheel filled the frame nicely. The hash is a little finer than I am used to but had a good crispy dark crust with a softer, lighter center. Eggs were spot on, firm whites under the hollandaise with soft runny yolks making a delicious mess of everything. No bread included so I had to request a biscuit for sopping. Big windows let in lots of light, dining room lay out has plenty of seating options: inside, outside, upside, bar side, and still has room to move about and visit. Friendly staff helps when nobody is your server so sorting out the check afterwards is almost fun.",

My fiance ordered a mimosa which had a weird neon orange color to it. He commented to me that he didn't think there was real orange juice in it but he finished it. We both liked the corn bread they brought out.   He ordered the left coast BLT with chips and I had the strawberry and cream cheese french toast. I typically don't do a lot of milk products but it came highly recommended. Maybe my hopes were too high. I just didn't love it. There were huge CLUMPS of semi warm cream cheese in it that I just scraped out. It also just didn't taste cohesive to me - it was like they toasted two pieces of bread, put cream cheese on it and pressed it together. My fiance liked it and ate a decent amount of it. I ordered homefries instead of meat.  I really liked them and I appreciated the Texas Pete on the table. My fiance loved his left coast BLT and said he would definitely get it again.   Service was decent but not great. They were super busy and there wasn't a lot of attention to detail. That being said, everyone who came by our table was generally nice. As we were leaving, I noticed a couple being seated at a table that had a small bowl on it with half used butter and pieces of chewed gum in it. This is an example of what I mean when I say there didn't seem to be attention to detail.   This isn't my favorite spot but it's not the worst, either. My fiance likes it so I am sure we will be back but it won't be at the top of my list.",

I arrived on a Tuesday morning and was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait for a table. I was able to seat myself. I was greeted promptly by the server who was pleasant. He took my order and my food came out quickly. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the amount of scrambled egg on my plate. I knew that my meal only came with one egg but this was literally 2 tablespoons worth of an egg. I asked for one additional egg and was charged $2. I seriously doubt that my initial portion was 1 entire egg. The eggs also tasted like powdered eggs. The French toast was bland and none of my food was hot. The syrup had a weird taste to it and they only had 1 option. Overall, I was not impressed with my meal. The servers were nice, however.",

Also, we sat and talked for a Long time and no one rushed us, granted I think they were about to close.  The food was not \"bad\", but it was okay at best. I just wanted a great waffle with strawberries. Been having a taste for it ever since my experience elsewhere. What I got was a doughy waffle with a couple of previously frozen (ewwww, Gross) strawberries and blueberries in one quadrant of the waffle over cheap whipped cream that was melted upon delivery. They didn't even put the powdered sugar over the entire waffle. Pitiful and half hearted effort from the chef. The actual waffle was one step up from Leggo my eggo.  Last, the dishes were sanitized, but not clean. You know how the dishwasher can do a bad job, leaving stuck on food particles? That was the case here. There was egg on my plate, spots on my silverware, and foreign objects in my water that had no ice and tasted poorly.  Long story short, I will not be returning here. Not sure what they're Famous for, but the food can't be it.",

It's a communal serving environment (like Pinky's) where you don't have just one server... It's \"all hands on deck.\" The food taste and quality was very stellar. We both had specials. I had the key lime crepes and my husband had the crab scramble. Both were large and flavorful portions. I had coffee and he had orange juice (which seemed freshly squeezed but we didn't confirm that). Every meal comes with free cornbread. Only two minor pitfalls: (1) Two bathroom stalls, only (one for each gender) and for its size, I felt there should be more but the restroom was clean and cute. (2) Also, they don't have their liquor license, yet but will serve alcohol as soon as they do.",

After being seated, we were promptly welcomed and were served our drinks. After we ordered our food, we had not seen a server and no one came to our table to check on us. They say that \"everyone is your server\" but that just seemed like an excuse for them to not check on us. We waited for our food for about 35 minutes which was an okay wait. Still after getting our food, no server came to check on us. I had to wave down a bus boy for our bill after waiting 15 minutes after being done eating because there was still no server paying us any mind or in sight. I waited another 10 minutes for a server to come get my bill and payment but no one came so I had to walk up to the bar to pay and the server there was very rude. She snatched the receipt from my hand after I signed it and had a rude demeanor. The food was good overall which is why this wasn't a 1 or 2 star review. Would I go back? No.",

    "text": "Not overly impressed. Average.  We had been there for lunch and had a delicious wrap so we wanted to try brunch. Visited on a Sunday morning about 10 am.  Very busy and service was slow and inefficient.  Over 5 minutes to get water and coffee. Another 10 minutes before the complimentary cornbread came out. It was very good. Tender, not too sweet and warm. Served with a small container of warm, chunky apple butter (yummy). Another 10 minutes and the mains arrived. We had ordered Huevos Rancheros with sunny side up eggs. The eggs came scrambled and the server was not even aware until I pointed it out - it was her job to see if the order was correct.  I stuck with the scrambled rather than wait further.  80 percent of the plate was loose refried black beans with a few tortilla strips under the eggs and what was supposed to be pico de gallo, but was really a few chopped tomatoes with fine chopped onion and not much of it. Not what Huevos Rancheros is supposed to be. We had also ordered the Avocados Benedict. The eggs were nicely poached but served in an under-ripe (hard, tasteless) avocado half which made them difficult to eat. There was less than a teaspoon of a sauce (hollandaise?) and chopped tomato on top.  Supposed to have spices on top, but none to be found.  These special dishes were underwhelming but the \"regular\" breakfast dishes I spied on the way out looked better.  The side of fruit was simple but fresh.  Bill was $30 before tip, so pricey and not the experience or food quality we were looking for.",

It was busy and had about a 25 min wait but no big deal, that's not unusual. I didn't care for the location of the table because it was near the bottom of the steps coming from the entrance/waiting area so it was a lot of traffic and it was VERY close to another table. I ordered the cinnamon raisin French toast with a scrambled egg and turkey sausage. My husband had an omelette (western style I think) and potatoes. My food was just ok, nothing special. The French toast tasted like it was made with regular supermarket bought cinnamon raisin bread and the sausage also tasted like average store bought sausage. Just like the Walmart Great Value brand that I buy sometimes. My husband said his omelette was good. I tasted his potatoes and they were so good, seasoned to perfection. He thought so too. Before your meal you get complimentary corn bread and what I believe to be apple butter. I like my cornbread sweet and theirs wasn't so I didn't like it much. The prices were reasonable and you have more than one server which is a pretty good idea. I would go back and try an omelette with potatoes so overall, not a bad place.",

    "text": "My Wife and I attended yesterday as we had been told by friends about this new restaurant. I have to say that they did a beautiful job remodeling the place. It is a beautiful layout with great views of the pond inside the Boardwalk. We were greeted quickly and had our choice of where we wanted to sit. I had the French Toast Combo that came with an Egg cooked any way and a Breakfast meat of your choice. I chose Bacon of course. The Bacon was very flavorful and crispy, my egg was cooked a perfect over medium and the French Toast was incredible. My Wife had the Eggs Benedict and again, absolutely delicious. The Eggs were poached perfectly and the Hollandaise sauce was on point. She also had Potatoes with hers and they were so good that I about ate half of them and will definitely order those next time. The staff was very friendly from the time we walked in to the time we walked out. Drinks were always refilled and we even left with to go drinks. There was a altercation of some sort in the Kitchen that was loud and then we saw someone leaving out the front door with the Manager pointing at the door for him to leave. The Manager instantly apologized to the whole restaurant, then came to our table and introduced himself (I believe Tim was his name) and explained an employee was terminated and apologized for the noise and the interruption that caused in our dining experience and applied a discount for us. It didn't bother us but we were impressed none the less. We will be going back without a doubt. My only suggestion is to get a bigger sign so you can see the restaurant from the parking lot, it can be hard to spot.",

No one ever came back, even when it was time to pay our check! I had to wonder through the restaurant looking for someone to take our payment after we got tired of waiting. Beyond disappointing, especially since we love the Cary, NC (where we live) location so much and have had such positive experiences there.

    "text": "This one star is for the food alone. Let me start by saying I have NEVER given a restaurant anything lower than three stars so you know this is pretty bad. I went to the restaurant today at lunch time I arrived at 1:20 pm I remember precisely bc I sent a text message as soon as I got there so I just went back to check the time. Anyway it was busy so there was a wait which I expected and didn't mind. I was greeted by the host and told there would be a twenty minute wait. The wait was actually thirty five but I was still ok with that. Finally when I'm seated SEVERAL waiters and waitresses walked by me saying nothing. This particular restaurant they don't have assigned tables I've been before anyone helps any table. Yet no one seemed to want to help me today. So finally I flagged a waiter down and ASKED him if he could help me. Now this part is very important I ordered my food and drinks at this time. I did this because they seemed to be busy and I already had to flag someone down to take my order I aid I better get it in while I have him. Ok so I talk to the guests with me, played on my phone, NOT ONCE was my drink refilled or my guests or were we even checked on. So after thirty minutes of waiting on my food I flagged down the saw gentlemen that took my order. I asked how long my food would be. He replied let me check and NEVER came back to my table. So I sit for another ten minutes and I notice the table beside me getting agitated as well. Finally I flagged down someone else who just so happen to be a manager her name was Merin. I informed her of how long I had waited and asked had he forgotten to put my order in. She said she would check on it. Did I mention this was a manager and my drink is now empty and she didn't offer me a refill either. Anyway she walks passed me three times saying NOTHING. Finally I ask her again we're up to forty minutes waiting on food now. She goes to the kitchen comes back and says the kitchen is backed up and apologizes. She asked if I needed anything while I wait and said they were cooking my food. After another ten minutes my food arrives the manager Merin brings it and I ask for my bill because at this point I just don't want to flag anyone down again when I'm done eating. She replies you don't have a bill I'm taking care of it. Here some advice to famous toastery in university city if I come to eat I don't want a free meal I want GOOD SERVICE and GOOD FOOD and REFILLS on my drink. I do like the food so I will visit other locations but a word of advice if you are hungry don't go here you will be starving by the time you actually eat!",

Breakfast was excellent and their policy of \"everyone is your server\" was helpful. There's always a waiter or waitress nearby to refill drinks and clear dirty plates.  They need a way better method for splitting checks. While it was great that they did split our seven breakfasts into six separate checks, it took a little trial and error to get it worked out straight.  I chose the stuffed French toast. A substantial portion (four halves of two slices each) well loaded with smooth peanut butter and sliced bananas. Not too sweet but definitely the lead up to my carb crash nap once I got home. The waitress who brought our food wasn't the same one who prepared it in the kitchen so my \"no powdered sugar\" was missed. Though it did make for a lovely presentation and I knocked it off onto the side plate.  Nice sized restaurant with plenty of space. Outside tables have a good view of the small pond with fountain and paddleboating. Someone brought their dog for the full al fresco experience!",

I went for Sunday brunch and would have enjoyed the food Waffle House much more(not knocking Waffle House because I like the waffles). The complimentary corn bread was heavy and dry which made me fill up on water after attempting to eat one chuck, and the cornbread comes in chunks.  I had a frittata and raisin toast. The bread was not toasted but the frittata was pretty good. Roasted potatoes also came with the meal and they were tasty. The egg was a tad over cooked and browned which is not good for eggs. The server was great and attentive so tip well if you go. Oh, and be prepared to hunt for a parking space because they are scarce.",

My order of lightly scrambled eggs were as requested, and the hashbrowns were piled high,  too.  They missed the 5-star level with a clunky manner in how to split the tab individually among 7 diners, and we were never quite sure who was our server.  That being said, we were well cared for, the food was good, and the prices reasonable.  I say 'Give 'em a whirl.\"",

    "text": "Me and 'Toast' are no strangers. Several visits to the quaint Davidson location and occasionally the one at Concord Mills, I'm known to be a fan of their food.  I'm not huge on the 'every server is your server' routine, mostly because you don't really get to make a connection with a particular server. It's just nice to be able to remember one person's name and have a bit of chit chat. I digress, this restaurant's staff has better chemistry than the other two I've been to. I think it all boils down to communication. I've had instances in Davidson where my drink sat empty for a while and when someone finally came by they apologized and admitted that they thought someone else was taking care of it. Not an issue here at University though. Fast, friendly servers that seem to have it down.  I got the Huevos Rancheros as I've been on a particular crave for this lately (and am currently seeking a Mediterranean version of this classic, would pay good money for one). The food came out promptly and at first I thought I had made a horrible mistake, I didn't get any meat! What's breakfast without meat (apologies to my herbivore friends)?! As I sat there already a bit disappointed (in myself) I quickly changed my tune. Perfect over-easy eggs, great seasoning on the beans, very crispy tortilla strips, a generous helping of avocado, and topped with salsa. Between the protein in the beans and all the carbs, I was fully satisfied. I'm the mirror opposite of a vegetarian but I do gotta admit that this dish was very balanced, tasty, and satisfying just the way it is.  A couple of notes for your dining experience: The breakfast and lunch menu are both served all day. They do have a well stocked bar with the usual like Bloody Marys and Mimosas (just make sure it's past 10am, unlike us) as well as some speciality indulgences. It would be nice if the staff had a simpler way to split checks, but I don't blame them for the confusion as our table, all consisting of diehard Yelpers trying to earn a silly badge, we're splitting a check six ways.  My suggestion is to get here early as on the weekends the tables fill up fast. Either way its worth the wait!",

Before I rave about the food, just know that akward feeling you have at other restaurants when you need something and you cant find your wait person, you wont have here.  Every employee is there to serve you. No turning around in your seat anxiously looking for your wait person, watching other servers pass you by.  Or trying to remember what your server looks like; I know I'm not the only person this has happened to, lol.  Not here, call on anyone! Awesome! Once I sat down one of the employees noticed me attempting to clean, she came right over and made it right!  I made sure to sit where I could look out at the man made lake.   I ordered the shrimp ( for my shrimp counters, there was a good count) and grits and they were good, as far as the flavors.  Only draw back was that the onions and bell peppers werent cooked to tender.  So you have this great dish of softness, then crunchy.  My preference is a more consistent texture throughout the dish. It also comes with a biscuit, it was great!",

Once, she even had the chef whip up an item from a previous menu that we enjoyed so much.   If you're ever in the area and looking for a great brunch spot, famous toastery is it!

We were brought corn bread, whipped butter, and apple butter almost immediately. This was not offered at the other location I have been to. I ordered an apple cinnamon pancake, smoked sausage, and scrambled eggs with cheddar. I was surprised when my pancake came out. I am used to pancakes coming out smothered in topping.

I'm not from this area, but that corn bread was amazing. So sweet tasting.    They offered a shrimp and grits special, which was so good.  It came with a biscuit.  They really know how to make bread in the South.  The dish had a nice kick to it and the grits were nice and cheesy.  I really enjoyed my meal and would come back again.",

When I said I had not been before the important items for the server were to point out that 1. Every server is our server and 2. Everything was made fresh in house.  As for the food, I ordered the Combo (flapjack with an egg and bacon). The only thing the server asked was how I wanted my egg. I wish he had asked if I wanted powdered sugar on my flapjack. Personally, I'm not a fan, but that didn't impact my review.  My problem was that for the food to be fresh in house, it all came to the table barely warm. I expect it to be hot. Especially with only four people in the restaurant. Being too busy was definitely not the issue. The flapjack was undercooked. The bacon was limp. The egg was actually cooked properly, however it too was cold.  For the price and hype, my expectation was high but unfortunately it was let down.",

    "text": "Found this place through Yelp when I was looking for a good breakfast place while traveling for work. I went during the week with a co-worker. Nice atmosphere inside, clean, on the water so there's a great view. When we came in there was only 3 other tables seated so we had our pick of where to sit.   Service: They have a different philosophy here, everyone is your server, not just one person which sounded great at first. One girl took our drink order and it took about 5min for another girl to bring them. We placed our orders and noticed there were about 6 servers standing around just watching us...awkward! Our food came and as we were eating and trying to discuss work we were stopped by 5 different servers coming by to see how it was...I don't mind someone checking in, that's their job and what should happen. However, they should have communication between them instead of every couple minutes someone interrupting. Then when we were done and our plates had been cleared it was like a ghost town! All 6 servers ha disappeared we had a credit card on the table ready to go with the bill and couldn't find anyone on the floor to ring us up for about 20min. This system seems very flawed to me as compared to having 1 person being attentive to a table that knows what's going on.   Food: The food was pretty good and in decent portion sizes. My co-worker got strawberry stuffed french toast and she liked it. I got a Greek egg white omelet which was pretty good...a little watery. The coffee was terrible so I'd do hot tea if available next time.   I would try them again but will look for another local place to call home when I'm in that area due to the service being so awkward.",

The food was tasty, couldn't go too wrong with what I ordered. I stuck pretty much to tradition. I got the combo with a plain pancake.  I will say this, the hash browns, more like potato chunks, were worth whatever exorbitant price I paid. I'd go back to just get a takeout of those and Polish them off in the car! However, I thought $22  breakfast bill for just me was a little over the top. Especially when I can go to Dennys down the street and for the same thing be paying under $10.",

The hollandaise sauce on the eggs Benedict was so bland I assumed I was eating egg yolk with cream... it needed to be jazzed up for sure. The portion sizes were great though. The omelet did not lack any filling. And the coffee, although not very good, was hot!   My wait time here was about an hour on a Sunday around 11:15, so heads up on that! Overall, if you don't mind salting your food and you want one meal to get you through the day, this place is for you.",

    "text": "I came during the morning to meet up for breakfast. Parking is great during this time, but to locate this place, the sign cannot be seen from the parking lot. Sitting anywhere at this location is great because you can overlook a small body of water & sometimes there are ducks wading.   I ordered the combo which consisted of pancakes or French toast, two eggs any style and a choice of two pieces of meat. I chose the strawberry and cream cheese stuffed French toast, two over easy eggs and two pieces of turkey sausage. The only positive about the food is that the turkey sausage wasn't your usual small, rubbery pieces. They were sand dollar sized and decent tasting. The over easy eggs weren't anything special.   I was most disappointed in the strawberry and cream cheese French toast because I love anything French toast, so I was sure my choice would be great. It was very generic tasting. To me, it tasted like regular strawberry cream cheese you would buy from the store. That's it. They took that, put it in between two pieces of bread and then on a French toast griddle.   Other than that, our waitress was really pleasant.",

    "text": "Finally got around to trying Famous Toastery (FT). I've heard such great things about this particular location so I had no hesitation when a friend invited a few folks out to brunch.   The location is extremely beautiful, sits on a sort of man made lake, ducks, paddle boats and tons of cute shops. It was such a beautiful day to sit outside with the sun shinning & perfect weather (finally).  The interesting thing about FT from my experience is I don't believe you have just one waiter/waitress which was a gift/curse. Our initial waiter brought out water and took drink orders. We ordered the Jack Belinni's (I highly recommend) and the Rum Mimosa's which are more on the sweet side. Drinks were made nicely but of course could have been stronger lol but don't we all think that way?  After getting our drinks, it took maybe 20 mins for someone to come back to take our order. We had to ask a waiter that was servicing another table for our waiter and long/behold our new waitress came to take our order. After placing our order of Shrimp & Grits which were so well made & delicious. Think the chef was a bit heavy handed on the cheese but I ate around it still good.  Eventually the bus boy came out and took our plates and yet again we're all looking for our waiter/waitress to order another round of drinks. Eventually someone showed up, took our order for another round which never came out. We literally had to go find our waiter and ask for an update. We were told it wasn't put in by the waitress so again we waited. The entire 2.5hrs we were there we had 2 drinks because of us constantly waiting.  Overall, FT is  stars but I can't over look how they over stretch & extend their wait staff because it causes their service to suffer which is why I put . A recommendation would be to give one server a large table and maybe a smaller one. A customer should never have to ask for their waiter/waitress",

This food is basic diner food dressed up on the menu and in the photos to be upscale, but it's not. The \"hollandaise\" that came with my \"house made hash\" was some kind of canned margarine based sauce like substance that is flavorless while clinging to the roof of your mouth and leaving a distinct thickener aftertaste. Bleck. The prices for the basics are exorbitant. We ordered sides of french toast with our 2 breakfasts and 2 coffees it came to $40. French toast was dry and boring. Coffee was ok.",

I ask for the steak to be cooked medium well, it was tough, dry, no flavor, and the green peppers and onions were too crunchy. The scrambled eggs were pretty good. The hashbrowns were crispy on the outside a very mushy on the inside. I asked for plenty of butter on my wheat toast and I got grain or some kind of seed toast with little to no butter on it. The fresh sqeezed oj was the highlight of the meal, it was really good. Courteous and professional staff. Clean unisex bathrooms.",

Pros: Good food, pretty speedy service(once you're actually seated), beautiful scenery to take in while waiting.   Cons: We were a party of four, but the restaurant doesn't seem to have any big tables. We were completely jammed, in a corner seat with little to no space to move, nor was there enough space on our table for our meals and drinks.   2.) the grits portion of my shrimp and grits were extremely watery. My meal was good, but the famous hash was nothing to brag about, however my GF thoroughly enjoyed her omelette.   3.) the restaurants \"Everyone is your server\" concept is awesome in theory, but it led to confusion when we needed something.  All in all it wasn't a bad experience, however, I'd like to visit Famous Toastery again on a day when we're not in the middle of Sunday brunch to see if the experience is better.",

We waited in line for over an hour, it was an estimated 45 min wait. We were promptly greeted and our order taken. Manager brought out orders, mine was completely screwed up so he went back to get it corrected. In the meantime my boyfriend couldn't eat his because we didn't have any silverware. 10 minutes later no staff had even walked by so I hunted down some silverware. 10 more minutes later my French toast came out but no one brought syrup with the meal. I had to walk around and look for some. We finished eating and had to wait about 20 more minutes for the check. Multiple servers including our regular had walked by multiple times and never checked on us. The server was attentive to the table next to us so I asked if we could get our check while they were being tended to. No refills were provided and we weren't checked on. Food was okay but not worth spending 2.5 hours at the restaurant where I had to hunt down everything needed. The whole time the table next to us was heckling us on why we looked mad/irritated and using profane language mimicking me. Next time we'll go elsewhere.   Also plates had stains and food residue on them. You can tell they aren't properly washed.",

Now to the 2 things I took off stars for:  1) \"Everyone is your server\" was horrible. It seemed like nobody communicates with each other because we had a server check in with us almost continuously the entire time. I have worked in restaurants before so I see NO advantages to this concept for the customer or the server. The idea that you can \"ask any one of us for something\" is actually standard practice in most restaurants . You won't find a server who isn't assigned to your table refuse to help you- it's what servers do for each other.  2) Servers made us feel incredibly uncomfortable. It was slow so it was very noticeable when there were servers just pacing the floor, gathered nearby gossiping, staring at tables. I'm sure there was somewhere else they could have been. We counted 6 servers to handle 3 tables. Six! Did all 6 need to be on the floor? No. 4 or 5 could have been in the back doing side-work or just not there at all.  Overall- I won't be back for awhile. There are plenty of amazing places to eat in my own neighborhood.",

The hamburger was huge and cooked just as ordered and very good. Stacked high with two slices of tomato and lots of lettuce. A salad on your hamburger for sure. They have beers and lots of champagne cocktails of all types to choose from. They even had a Jack Daniels breakfast cocktail . Lots of liquored up coffee drinks. A great brunch place. Closes at 3pm so get there before then. Weekends you will have to wait for a table but it is so worth it. They do have some outside seating available also. I highly recommend you try this one if you are in the area. Located on the Boardwalk.",

We went on a Tuesday morning around 8am, and there was barely anyone in the restaurant. However, our multiple servers still managed to mess up orders and fail to bring out basics like water for everyone. The food did not come out all at once and we had multiple items delivered that we hadn't ordered.  I did have the sunrise burrito, and it was solid. It comes loaded with brie and avocado, which is pretty difficult to mess up. I did end up with a free, extra plate of hash browns, and those were quite good. They are more like breakfast potatoes than hash browns, and I wish they would have been labeled that way on the menu so I would've ordered them.  Overall, the environment and food is nice, just disappointing that the wait staff couldn't get it together on a slow weekday morning.",

    "text": "Awesome brunch spot located in a little niche area near the Hilton lake in the University area in Charlotte.  To start, the service was extremely nice, and yeah, I get that people are nicer in the South, but everyone we spoke with seemed genuinely happy, which isn't always the case.  We sat in the back sun-drenched dining room, overlooking the lake and fountain - didn't even feel like you were in Charlotte.  Their menu is great and you are able to customize items, which is always helpful.  I ordered the breakfast burrito with a side of home fries.  Their home fries are amazing - packed with so much flavor and spice!  The burrito was OK - a bit dry and tasteless, but after adding some hot sauce and black pepper, it was good.  It's definitely filling and a nice portion size.  All of us were impressed with our brunch and left feeling satisfied.  Definitely a busy place that takes care of its customers and I'll definitely come back the next time I'm visiting my buddy in Charlotte.",

It's a bit of a food desert around here and a spot where its possible to order healthy and good food fast make Famous Toastery a main stay for sure.  I showed up with 13 ladies from my office. I called ahead, and while they don't accept reservations they assured me they would be able to accommodate us quickly for lunch.  After a few tables were pushed together and our food came out lightning fast for a group of our size. The multiple server model worked on this day, maybe because they weren't too busy.  Portions were enough for lunch with a few of us even opting to take home leftovers.  Our group loved that you can order breakfast all day and with ingredients like quinoa you can feel good about your meal choice. If you want, their french toast looked worth the splurge too.",

Alas, the food wasn't really as expected. The omelette I ordered was - sausage, bacon, ham which didn't have any flavor. Just the meat was wrapped in a pan fried egg. The eggs weren't fluffy - was rather flat.   The good thing here was their fresh orange juice which didn't have added sugars. So healthy. And hence a bit tangy - which I like.   There was a longer wait but we got our seats within 15 minutes. They give you coffee while you wait but it wasn't anything spectacular.   My friends had variants of veggie omelette which was even worse. No spice, nothing really great to come back to.   The toasts which they gave were not well done. Bread was okayish.   They do have a lake side seating which might be good but the food isn't worth the ambience.",

The server was not pleasant so we spoke with the manager who rectified the situation. We were there for a birthday brunch and wanted the server to bring out a cake that was brought with candles. Well the cake was brought out but candles were not placed on the cake or lit. This was unexpected I've been to several birthday dinners where the server was able to do this. This event made things very awkward us having to place and light the candles on our own when it was intended to be a surprise. We each were given several different checks with modifications (not sure why exactly) after paying the manager stated two tabs were not paid yet. We refused to pay since it was there mess up. The two tabs that were not paid was not anything we ordered. When handing the cards back out after payment the server was about to give us a credit card for another table.

Still not my favorite but at least someone there cares about customer service.    I wish I could give this place zero stars. Previously I had been to Toast and never was never wowed but was never disappointed either. Today I met my girlfriend for brunch, she got an omelette and I got the lunch special which was meatloaf with roasted veggies. My meatloaf came and I ate a few bites and it was good though dry, I went to eat more of it and discovered that a majority ooutside was burnt. I couldn't even penetrate the crust with my knife. The waitress came over to Check on us, I Informed her of the issue and she offered to fire me and a new entree. By this time my dining companion was almost done her omelette so I declined and said the veggies are OK I will just eat them. Please take this entree off our bill. Here's when things went sideways. I received our bill and they had charged me for a side order of roasted veggies. Now yes, I know I ate the roasted veggies, but that was because my protein was inedible. I explained this to the server and asked if this was correct, did they mean to charge me for only a side. He went and talked to the manager and long story short they refused to remove the roasted veggies off of our bill.  I'm still kind of gob smacked, when you get something that's inedible usually the whole entree is comped and they offer their sincerest apologies. That did not happen here and quite frankly I'm over Toast. Mediocre service and bad food. I will not be back.  Oh and evidently a side of roasted veggies is 3.99 FYI.  Give me a break.",

My Mother is visiting for a few months and requested to go out to a restaurant where we could sit down and enjoy our food.Since she's never been to a Famous Toastery we swung by for a late afternoon lunch . We had no issues with the food but the service has sharply declined. Inattentive is the most positive term I can use to describe our sever. She literally took our food order and that was it. We never received our cornbread, she didn't check to make sure we received our food much less if we received the correct order,or if we were satisfied. I had to get up and hunt for syrup from whatever random employee I could find and I almost died of thirst halfway through my meal. When I finally located our server and requested assistance at the end of my meal for a drink and a box I was told the bar had already closed to which I responded immediately responded and let her know if she'd bothered to check on her table she would've know we needed something way before the bar closed. It's not a high end facility but at minimum some form of service is expected. The most staff interaction I received was when some random team member approached my table in the middle of my meal and asked if they could remove the sugar (wow)!",

As a table, we ordered: The New Yorker with grits and wheat toast; spinach, mushroom and gruyere omelet with homefries and sourdough toast; the runner's omelet with homefries and wheat toast; and a kids order of pancakes with bacon and homefries.   Within ten minutes everyone's food was out . We simultaneously dug in. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try anything off of anyone else's plate but my spinach, mushroom and Gruyere was pretty good. I will say I felt like it was missing something (maybe a sauce of some sort or an extra element to impart more flavor). It was still well cooked inside and out with plenty of filling. The homefries were really the star for me, packed with flavor and a generous portion to boot. They were cooked to the perfect texture.  Definitely noteworthy!! I also ordered the sourdough toast which was absolutely fabulous. It was definitely good sourdough not some prepackaged garbage.   Everyone else enjoyed their entrees. Not a drop was left on anyone's plate and we were all stuffed. Best of all, everything came up to $43 and some change. Not bad at all.   I will definitely be back soon and plan to make this my go to breakfast place.   As we were leaving, I had food envy when I saw a man eating a bagel and lox. (Didn't even see that on the menu). The piece of lox was absolutely beautiful! That will be my next conquest",

    "text": "I come to this location all the time, and use the online join the waitlist tool. I put my name on the wait because it said that there was a 45 min to an hour wait. I arrive 25 mins after my arrive time, yes that's completely my fault because of traffic and parking. When I got to the front, the host told me that they would have to put me at the bottom of the list because i didn't check in on time. That is completely ridiculous, I can understand having to wait for 10-15 mins because I was late, but it defeats the purpose of me having joined online if I was just going to be pushed to the back of the line. This is just poor customer care. I too use the waitlist tool at my job and I would never tell a guest that they had to go to the back of the line if We took them off the list, not them taking themselves off. I bring my family here every time they come into town. That just really broke my heart that I may not come back to this location. Outside of this the experience has always been great, but it was so terrible today that I had to write a review and give one of my favorite places 2 stars.",
