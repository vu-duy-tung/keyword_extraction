    "text": "Sandwich Max provides some darn tasty sandwiches. The TCB is my personal favorite, though I prefer it on a wheat roll over the traditional bread option. Online ordering through Yelp is a great option, too. They offer a check-in for 10% currently which is a bonus.  The decor was not updated much from when it was Sub Station II, but it is enjoyable enough if you want to dine in. The staff is generally very friendly and welcoming. There are daily specials that include a free drink.   The parking can be a bit of a pain, but the price is fair for the quality of food you get (i.e. fresh sliced deli meats and cheeses cut for that sandwich).",

You can add on tomato, peppers, lettuce, pickles, etc. I literally devoured the whole thing!  I cannot wait to try more of their sandwiches. They deliver in the neighborhood also which is awesome!",

However, after eating at this place several times over the past few months, they are by far my new fave!!  So first off, the value that you get for your money here just blows me away.  Basically, you're paying the same prices as Subway but getting a MUCH MUUUUUCH better gourmet legit sandwich.  I love that they're super accommodating, and will customize any sandwich for you, toast it, do different bread--- whatever you want!  My favorite is the pressed TCB (with the original toppings + black olives), but the Reuben, the ham/cappicola/chz, and the Italian are all awesome too.    During the course of us eating here, I've actually gotten pregnant, and I LOVE the fact that they toast my sandwiches up to the proper temp so I can still eat them :).  That's a big deal when you're having serious sandwich cravings that most places can't accommodate lol.  They have this special toaster thing that makes them all melty and yummy without being soggy.  Definitely worth a try, you won't be disappointed.",

One allows delivery to my work and the other does not. Both ordering forms are different too, one not having as many options as the other. Not sure if they realize this.

Nothing has ever been soggy or soft - always crispy, crunchy with beautiful color.  I usually get the chicken breast salad and add on as many extras as I like like bell peppers, cucumbers, pickles, black olives, and then I get a choice of lettuce and tomatoes, onions, etc  They make their own Ranch dressing and it's great.  They have great tuna salad too. Homemade and chunky with boiled eggs.  Can't go wrong.  Their daily special sandwiches give you a break on the sandwich, chips, and a drink.  It's a True neighborhood spot and it's always great to run into people I know.   Lots of business lunch goers and folks from the nearby hospitals.  Ignore the negative reviews if you are looking for fresh ingredients.  If you're new to the neighborhood, this could become one of your favorites.",

I'm kicking myself for only trying Sandwich Max two weeks ago since I can walk there now. BEST. SUBS. EVER.  I love a good sandwich. If you were to look at my twin sister and I's text message thread, you would find a ridiculous amount of texts about sandwiches since we know not to go buy one without asking if the other wants one. Turkey and cheese subs are life. I normally take pictures of what I order to link to my reviews, but both times I've eaten there, I couldn't wait to take the picture and dove right in.  I love the turkey sub on white bread with provolone cheese. I get \"the standard\" toppings, minus salt and onions and I added pickles. The large sub is cut into quarters and I was sad when it was gone. I tried the potato salad with it and it doesn't disappoint, but nothing could be better than that sub.  All of the construction around it is a pain and I was worried I was walking into a seedy place because of how the entrance currently looks, but the restaurant itself was homey. I drove there on the way home tonight, but I will definitely walk from now on because the parking lot isn't the easiest to get in and out of, especially with all those scary signs everywhere.   I'm already looking forward to my next visit!",

After passing this location a few times and just ignoring it I saw Tonya's review and pictures, and decided to add it to my list. Working from home last week I had 30 minutes before my next call and decided to make a drive over to 7th street to check out Sandwich Max.  After walking in I was greeted by the Manager/Owner who walked me through the menu, told me about their specials, etc.  Being my first visit I decided to stick with a usual, turkey with swiss cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo and onions.  The sandwich was made to order and I was out the door in less than 10 minutes.  After arriving home I opened the sandwich and I was very impressed, it was huge! And, the taste was great. Fresh bread, perfectly sliced meat and condiments.  Along with sandwich I ordered the potato salad, also very fresh and a mayo base which I enjoy. Knowing about this place I will remember it when I crave a sub sandwich and the usuals don't cut it.",

The first time I ordered, I was a little disappointed with the amount of filling the the sandwich, not as much as I had hoped. In fact, that first sandwich had half as much filling as the Jersey Mike equivalent. Their \"standard\" way is similar to \"Mike's way\" but, I think jersey mike's is more flavorful. The bread however, I like better than jersey mikes. The turkey provolone we got today was much better than the first, they really packed it with toppings. I got a very filling sandwich for two for about $9.50.   I will be back for more when the bf picks up his dry cleaning at Kim's cleaners next door.",

Comparing this place to Jersey Mike's (across the street) would be like comparing a Dae Woo to a Maserati. Not a car buff? Okay, how about krystal burger vs five guys? Not a metaphor person? FINE, it's like comparing a poorly assembled piece of trash to a pristine example of the finest craftsmanship. Folks, the sandwiches are great and I am a sandwich person (figuratively, of course). Don't like sandwiches? YOU AREN'T AMERICAN OR HUMAN. Do like sandwiches? EAT HERE! Other factors:  Ambiance? Cool indie skateboard art, crackle barrel chairs, and tiny TVs. B+ Service? Always friendly and fast. A+ Ingredients? Fresh, but alfalfa sprouts and a better chip selection would be much appreciated! (Artisan brands like Boulder Canyon and Zapps) A-  I cannot vouch for their salads because I am a blue-blooded man and do not eat such things when given the alternative of sandwich.",

It's very reminiscent of Jersey Mikes, where the meat is sliced fresh, there's thin shards of lettuce and everything is piled high. Sandwiches like these are things you dream about! Then there's the added bonus of a kosher dill slice. This sandwich was something I want to come back for again and again.   Every day they have a different sandwich special, but I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu!

I was looking for something quick to grab so I could watch the Nebraska game from my couch. This place is just minutes down the road, so I popped in this past Saturday.  Scanning all the sandwiches, I (as usual) couldn't figure out what I wanted. The guys behind the counter immediately jumped in to help. Really nice. They said their best sellers are the Italian (on the cold side) and the pressed turkey cordon bleu (on the hot side). Score, I already had my eye on the Italian. I got a small with chips and a drink for $8.55.   The Italian was loaded with meat. The toppings were fresh. Solid little place to get a sandwich. I'll be back to try that TCB.   Also, they have Cherry Coke. I don't drink a lot of soda, but when I see CC on the fountain... you can bet I'm ordering one.",

I wish I could better describe what was missing, the sandwiches just seemed a little bland.

I decided to grab a sub before heading out to the pool and ordered the Turkey and provolone on wheat bread.  I asked for them not to make it with the oregano since I've never liked that spice anyway. It was the perfect meal for a day in the hot sun at the pool. Light but filling. The meat and cheese was very fresh!  If you're looking to support local...this is the place! I also learned that they deliver without requiring you to spend a minimum and there is NO delivery charge...say whaaaaa? I'm not sure how long that will last so you may want to try their delivery while it's free! Be sure to check in because I believe there is a promo code. Enjoy!",

My sandwiches are always super fresh, really delicious, and maybe $1 more than Subway where the ingredients are hard to pronounce and for the most part, artificial. Very laid-back, and the daily specials with chips/drink is about $9 for a small (which is equivalent to a Subway footlong).  I'm here multiple times a week since I'm in Midtown for work and it's great, especially if you need a below-$10 lunch option in the expensive Elizabeth/Dilworth area. I'm a regular customer and I'll definitely keep coming back. About the only \"negative\" is all the construction that's going on in that area, but that isn't on the owner or the restaurant...plus it's starting to look nice.  Definitely hope they stick around.",

It was however a large amount of food (a 12 inch sub, chips, and drink for $10) for a pretty low price. The atmosphere was kind of dull but that didn't affect my experience at all. While the sandwich was very large, it was kind of plain and flavorless. Go to Sandwich Max if you want a good amount of food for a low price.",

    "text": "So once again, I went to a place based on really good reviews, and once again, i was disappointed.   Went to Sandwich Max on a Saturday at 2pm. There was three people working. There were maybe 3 other people eating sandwiches already and we were the only people in line. I mention this because it was relatively slow and the place was really dirty. My boyfriend and I decided to eat in and every table was dirty (crumbs, pieces of toppings from sandwiches like stray pieces of lettuce, water stains from cups, etc) and the floor was pretty unclean too. Oh well, maybe we had just missed the lunch rush? Anyway, for the food, I ordered a cheesesteak with peppers and mushrooms; my boyfriend got capicola, ham and cheese. The cheesesteak, was flat out horrible! If you've ever been to jersey mikes and get a cheesesteak, you can see them cooking the meat on the flattop. When I got the sandwich, it was clear that they have meat already chopped and cooked sitting in a cooler somewhere and they just microwave it. How do I know, the peppers and mushrooms were cold and the sandwich itself was dripping in water/juice whenever you picked it up. It was not right - That gets 1 star. The cold cut sandwich my boyfriend got, the meat was good, but the bread was old and the toppings skimpy.  I get that this is a local place and probably has a lot of local support, but I'm really sick of local places resting on their 'local laurels' and then producing subpar product. It's like my boyfriend commented when we were trying to figure out why this got such high reviews 'It's like the sandwiches are made by people who hate their lives and eaten by people who hate their lives.' Maybe this is harsh, but I'm sick of paying money for food that isn't good. Sorry sandwich max, I don't mean to vent on you, but what I just experienced was not a 4.5 experience.",

I ordered two veggies. He grunted then said that they would only heat the cheese. Usually sub shops make the sandwich, layer with cheese then run through the toaster. Not a big deal. I said sure, that's ok. My order ticket moved down the line and someone on the prep line said \"what the fuck is this!?\" followed by a third guy who asked me about the heating instructions. He said that the lettuce would be wilted and pointed to the microwave behind him. I said that cold would be find, not an issue... he heated both anyway... in the microwave. Not sure why they didn't use the toasters that are also located along the back wall or why he heated them after I said cold was fine. Ultimately, it's not an issue of how or if the sandwich was heated, but it's about customer service. There are so many other sandwich shops nearby - next time I'll choose differently.",

    "text": "Let me first say that my Reuben was great. A good portion of corned beef and not over powering with the sauerkraut. Everything else about the experience was sub-par.  I arrived, was the only customer inside, and there were no employees at the counter. I waited for a minute and someone finally came out and took my order. Like I said, a Reuben to go, nothing crazy. Immediately after I ordered, a dad and his two sons came in and ordered. I waited about five minutes, and somehow their THREE sandwiches came out before my one. Also while waiting I noticed that the floor was pretty nasty. Discarded Cheetos and shredded lettuce were littered under almost every table. Maybe they had a lunch rush and had not had time to clean up, or maybe they only sweep once a week, who knows?  I continued to wait and overheard the two employees discussing how happy they were that they were only open another three hours. I mean, I'm no fan of working on Sundays, but keep it at a lower volume so customers can not hear it.  I was pleased with the sandwich, but overall pretty disappointed in the experience.",

I got two small sandwiches: the Italian with standard toppings and banana peppers and a Reuben with thousand island dressing.   A word of warning: I wouldn't recommend getting a warm sandwich to go. They wrap it up and the condensation makes the bread soggy. That's on me. The Reuben was still pretty good though.   The Italian was outstanding. The meat was very fresh and the flavor was great. It was one of the better deli sandwiches I've had.   I think the cold sandwiches are really where this place shines. I'd love to go to the store to try it there.",

When you get to the counter, you can pick your sandwich from one of the many options on the board. I opted for a turkey ham and cheese. I chose wheat bread as my option. Next, you pick from the standard toppings, which are their suggestions on what to add to the sandwich. Then you can choose from a long list of additional toppings. All are included in the price of the sandwich.  They have a small but solid selection of chips. They also had a nice set of fountain drink choices.  I'll be honest, the Sandwich Max shopping center was the least inviting space to feel, and I only noticed it because they finally updated the shopping center outside and parking lot. This place now stands out for both its sandwiches and it's appearance! Next, I'm coming in to try the chef salad so I can really put this place to the test.",

It was a great bang for the buck - but the reubens (you get 2 for the $9.50 price - not sure why it's served that way) themselves were fairly mediocre.   The reuben was basically a corned beef sandwich - 90% of the sandwich was corned beef. Sadly the corned beef was a little below average. There was very little kraut and the cheese and russian were also barely noticeable. If you're just looking to get a mediocre corned beef sandwich for a good price you'll be content, but if you're looking for that full on reuben experience you should look elsewhere. I likely would have given Sandwich Max a 2/5 just due to the reuben, but I do love a good deal.",

The staff is really friendly and will accommodate any request you have. They've got hot sandwiches and subs which are amazing, but the mark of a good sandwich place is whether they can pull of a cold deli sub - and Sandwich Max nails it.

They have a daily sandwich special that essentially gets you a free drink, but I usually stick to water at all times (other than beer/wine of course).

Needless to say, I LOVED my sandwich. The people behind the counter were super friendly and gave me the low-down of how to \"build\" my turkey and cheese sandwich--lots of cheese options and veggies galore. Even the sub roll was impressive! I was offered a chance to have it cold or pressed on a panini machine. So glad I went the panini route and love that all the veggies were added AFTER the turkey and cheese were heated. The turkey was very high quality and the cheese was guey and yummy. The roll was crispy and the veggies were very fresh. Can't wait to go back!",

I have worked in sandwich shops, I make my own sandwiches, I eat lots of sandwiches, and I have yet to come across a better sandwich than Sandwich Max. If I find something I like, I usually don't stray from that particular order, and all 4 or 5 times I have ordered from Sandwich Max, I have gone with the Maxed Out, which is a variety of meats sliced to order on a fluffy bun, properly dressed and garnished with lettuce, onions, oil and vinegar and oregano. No fluff, no frills, the lettuce is shredded paper thin and wonderfully crispy, I can find absolutely zero faults with anything about the product. In addition, every time I walk in the door, I am greeted with a genuine hello, the staff has always been super friendly, if I had to wait, I was offered a cup for a soda, free of charge. I consider myself a full-blown sandwich aficionado, and anyone in Charlotte who has not tried this place should. My wife is from Pennsylvania and the Sandwich Max subs reminded her of northern Hoagie shops she used to go to as a kid. Lastly - The potato salad is off the charts. I will be back often, thank you, Sandwich Max!!!",

    "text": "Had the turkey, ham, & cheese for lunch and it was GREAT. Love to see a good sub place in Plaza Midwood/Elizabeth that's VERY reasonably priced. We ordered 16 subs for our entire office for lunch, and not a single one of them was screwed up. That's a HUGE win. We do that every week, and most of the time someone's is messed up or missing, or wrong. These guys have the right attention to detail and we're definitely going to visit again.",
