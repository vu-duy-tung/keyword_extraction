    "text": "Uhhh, no.  That will be my answer the next time anyone suggests Red Bowl to me.  The 3 1/2 stars it earned really surprised me though, however, I might've gone on an off day.  I didnt have sushi in the longest time, and was very excited to finally quench my craving. We walked in at 2:50, ten whole minutes before the lunch specials cut-off time.  We already knew what we wanted, but thanks to the snail paced server who took his time taking our order, we missed out on the the $7.25 entrees and were left with the $11-15 ones.  Big bummer for me, so I just opted for the Crazy Roll and the California Roll, shared between my lunch buddy.  The sushi took forever and a half to come out, anyway when it did, it was very delicious and we literally inhaled it.  We then decided to order the California Roll.......which was the worst thing I ever had, they skimped out on the rice so bad that you were able to see more nori than rice.  The rice was a bit crunchy too, and overall tasteless and inedible.  We did not eat that order, and they didnt even bother asking if we had a problem with it, something other establishments normally do.  Anywho, overall I give them 2 stars, 1 for the California Roll and 1 for the bathroom.  I'll have to find another place for my sushi fix, cause this aint cuttin for moi :-S",

    "text": "I have to agree with the previous reviewer-- restaurants specializing in more than one type of food are rarely great.  Red Bowl's number one thing going for it is that it has a full gluten-free menu, which can be great for some people.  I've eaten here a number of times and every time I'm underwhelmed. To me it seems like the food is just bland and slightly over-priced. I will say, however, that some people I know really seem to enjoy it, so perhaps my tastes just aren't that good (or maybe I have more experience with this kind of food!)  Atmosphere is quite nice, and the staff is pretty welcoming. If there were something better for this type of food in the area, I would have rated this place only 2 stars, but since this is about it, unless you want generic Chinese food, I'll give it 3.

We took it back and they apologized and remixed it and it tasted like normal.  Tonight we received sweet & sour sauce that tasted like vinegar.  We were told that there is a new chef and sometimes the sauce is dark and sometimes it is light.  I have eaten sweet & sour sauce for 20 years and NEVER had it taste like vinegar.    We paid $10 for sweet & sour chicken and have no sauce to eat it with.  We were offered no compensation and were told that no other customers complained about the sauce.  We will not be returning.  Such a shame that the food has gone downhill.",

    "text": "When I'm at a Chinese restaurant having a hard time with chopsticks, I always hope that there's a Chinese kid at an American restaurant somewhere who's struggling mightily with a fork.\" ~Rick Budinich  To call Red Bowl Asian Bistro a Chinese Restaurant would be like calling the Titanic a boat or the iceberg that sank it a cube.  Yes, Chinese food is on the menu but so are a great many other dishes that do not originate in China.  The best way to describe the cuisine at Red Bowl is to use the term fusion and since I think that word is pretentious, I am going to try it a different way.  Here goes...the food at Red Bowl is a delicious culmination of all the great far eastern delicacies prepared in a way that the Southern American palate can comprehend.  That is, the Red Bowl menu contains the very best selection of oriental delights that are marketable to the uninitiated diner.  Red Bowl serves food to appeal to gourmands and foodies alike.  Since I consider myself part of the latter group (not intending to be snobbish), I was especially impressed with the menu's vast selection.  At first, it may appear daunting, but once you settle in you'll realize, as I did, that the size of the selection is what earns Red Bowl the designation of Asian Bistro...in this case, size does matter.  There is no phrase that more aptly describes the subtle nuances and differences of their listed fare than \"Asian Bistro\".  To be sure, regardless of who you are dining with (I know this to be True because I have two very food-finicky kids), there is something on the menu for everyone.  One of the things that make my dining experience most enjoyable is the ambiance.  A nice ambiance can make a marginal meal good and vice versa.  Red Bowl's new Rock Hill location is perfectly outfitted, and the warm lighting, wood-paneled walls and open floor plan make a perfect setting in which to enjoy a meal.  The main dining room is elegantly appointed and spacious.  There is seating for 120 patrons at a time, and you won't feel crowded, because the atmosphere the open dining room creates is light and airy.  For those of you who are not looking for a full meal, you'll be pleased to know that Red Bowl has an elegant sushi bar manned by very experienced sushi chefs.  Here  you can sit comfortably with a friend, choose freely from the broad selection of makimono (variety of rolls like the ubiquitous California Roll) or Nigirizushi (hand formed sushi) and watch as they are meticulously prepared.  Watching the sushi chefs at Red Bowl is similar to watching a ballet; they are graceful, effective and efficient.  The chefs obviously take great pride in their work, and everything that leaves the kitchen is a masterpiece in style and taste.  Service can also determine a dining experience.  We were welcomed by Owner Joseph Yang and seated in a private dining room that can host up to 35.  I have to admit, I felt like a rock-star because the VIP treatment never ended.  I thought we might be getting preferential treatment because, after all, we were here to review the restaurant, so I wondered around the dining room to see how the \"mere mortals\" were being served.  To my delight, it was abundantly clear that great service was part of the package.   After we settled in, our waiter, Michael greeted us and took our drink order.  Both the Tega Cay and Rock Hill Red Bowl locations have an extensive bar and wine list (including a great selection of sake), and can serve just about any adult beverage you might desire.    We chose to eat \"family style\" and asked Joseph to choose the dishes as opposed to ordering from the menu.  This way, we decided, we would get to try everything that was brought to the table.  As the food arrived, Michael explained to the novices in our group what everything was and what ingredients each dish contained.    The sushi arrived first.  I am not sure exactly what we were served because there was so much of it-it seemed like there was one of each item on the sushi menu represented.  Sushi is one of my favorite foods and I have eaten it at various venues around the world from London to the Cayman Islands and everywhere in between.  Not only was the sushi expertly prepared and presented, it was delicious, too.  Actually, delicious is an understatement but I can't think of a word that aptly explains these taste bud treats.  We devoured the sushi platter (including the garnishes) as if we'd been stranded on an island without food for weeks.  In retrospect, had I stopped to consider how voraciously we ate, I might have been a little embarrassed.  The sushi was THAT good.  The remnants (what little there were) were cleared and the next course arrived which was an assortment of the appetizers.  Among the parade of pre-meal tid-bits were pan-friend dumplings, chicken skewers, lettuce wraps, spring rolls, egg rolls, and sauces for dipping.",

    "text": "Saved us from a Sunday night of frozen pizza! It was 9 o'clock and our options for dinner were rapidly diminishing when the Red Bowl Asian Bistro popped up on my android restaurant finder. They were open til 10 so the decision was made. Our initial greeting by what looked to be the owner of all ppl was not one of excitement  or even welcome....but the service was friendly which I suppose is what matters. We had sushi to start with, because I am a weenie eater when it comes to sushi we had a California roll, which let's face it is hard to make wrong, and a Dragon roll, which was a hit with the rest of the table.  Our table ordered the Broccoli Beef and the Cashew Chicken both of which got middle of the road responses (we didn't take these leftovers home, which speaks volumes), we also had a simple Chicken Lo Mein which was delish (with the addition of some soy sauce) and the Spicy Thai Basil Chicken that was unique and very fresh.  Another big plus were the portion sizes, we all ordered individual dishes, but there was plenty to share, which is half the fun of dining out right?    On another note, they don't serve alcohol on Sundays (sniffle), but if you bring in your church bulletin, you get a free soda (hmmmm....).  Even though half of the dishes failed to rock my world, the fact that the ingredients were fresh leads me to believe that after some investigation to weed out weak dishes, you'll be left with some pretty delicious Asian options when the mood strikes!",

We have probably been here a total of 10 times at least; a few times with other couples but mainly just the two of us. The ambiance is why I fell in love with this place. It is so clean and open with beautiful woods and reds- it is inviting and homey. The menu is insanely diverse although I usually stick with the Spicy Thai Basil Chicken or Spicy Tangerine.  My husband loves the Sushi and no longer has to drive to Ru San's for his fix.  The service has never been less than awesome. Never hesitate to customize an order as they are never hesitant to customize it for you. As long as you know what to expect- not quite a Benihana but definitely superior to Panda Express, I think you might be pleasantly surprised.",

When I got home, the pad thai portion was huge! I'm talking probably enough for 3 servings but the flavor really didn't sing to me.

It was a weekday night so the bistro was not too terribly crowded.  I ordered the diner \"bento box combo\" which was a ton of food for a decent price.  The only problem was that everything on the menu sounded good to try!  I tasted their \"bam bam shrip, spicy tuna roll, and white rice.  Everything was great!

I rather have just a straight Thai place or something.  Alright, off my rant.  This place is nearby, so I have tried a lot of dishes and found what is actually good.  Their potstickers, pork lo mein (chicken one is bland for some reason), sweet and sour chicken, and egg rolls are good (the easy stuff).  The bourbon chicken was terrible and watery.  The pad thai is no where close to authentic. Singapore noodles are not authentic either, but still tastes really good. Large portions of every entree helps them with the star rating.  Overall, average.  Wish we had more choices in Fort Mill area and more authentic places.  Oh well!",

Yes how does a Chinese restaurant mess up rice?  It looked like white rice that was colored in soy sauce or something similar.  Absolutely gross is the only way to describe it.",

Modern Asian feel inside, very nice and spacious with a good size bar. I also noticed what looked like a buffet at first, but is really a stir fry bar! (pretty cool)  Had Mongolian beef lunch special, for less than $7 its a steal. Comes with choice of spring or egg roll. And your choice of rice.  Rolls came out quick and piping hot. Also with dish that held 2 different dipping sauces. (sweet & sour, & some shrimp sauce I think?)  All the food was very good, service was good, left me wanting to come back!!",

On the way home we thought it would be a great idea to stop and have a cocktail and order some food to take home. I will break it down. Bar and bartender scary at best. Every surface you touched was stickey, gross. Bartender just wanted to go home. Bathrooms dirty, dining room had trash all over floor. Whole place just had an unpleasant smell. Ordered several apps and entrees to go (we left and were home in less than 10 minutes after getting our order),  including sushi. Sushi was the worst, most gross thing ever seen or smelled, it was WARM, fish was of some kind of ground consistenty, smelled and was uneatable. Egg rolls were missing. Called from home and response was \"everyone does sushi differant, and next time u come in just tell us we will give u a free eggroll. Beef with asparagus was tasteless except for the spice which I asked them to make it spicy, asparagus was just the woody end trimmings that were uneatable. However it had a whole lot of carrots, WTH. BEEF was junk. Garlic Pork was tastless, just overly hot with spice. This in my opinion is the worst place I have ever seen.",

Dishes range from Mongolian to Japanese to Thai to Chinese...etc.  It's sort of like lumping all Europeans together and letting Spaniards cook your schnitzel and kraut.  Red Bowl would better themselves by refining dishes they are strongly familiar with.    I enjoy eating here, but why order overpriced Chinese food you could get at another Chinese restaurant?  Stick to something you can't get somewhere else.  Try:  The sushi  New to sushi:  Try tuna rolls  Pretend it's sushi:  Try the sweet potato rolls or Californian rolls",

I pressed a potato onto the plate and it didn't rip or break apart, it BENT.... potatoes shouldn't bend. The spicy sauce wasn't really spicy either. The rice was mushy and over cooked.   It wasn't inedible, but I wouldn't return here. Honestly I've had microwaveable dinners that tasted better.",

    "text": "Just back from my first visit to Red Bowl in almost four years. I live about 1 mile away from Red Bowl but stopped eating there due to the poor food and high prices. I was just reminded of how bad the food really is at Red Bowl.  I ordered pork fried rice, cashew chicken and chicken with broccoli.  The rice had absolutely no flavor. None. It was just an overcooked, mushy pile of rice with some once-frozen veggies that were very dry. Both chicken dishes were absolutely drenched in oil and much too salty. I can honestly say that this was one of the worst meals I've ever had - my family shared the same opinion. Add in the higher relative prices compared to most Chinese restaurants and you have the perfect recipe for an entirely disappointing and unacceptable meal. I'd rate this zero if I could.   A four year absence from Red Bowl made me forget how bad it truly is. That's not a mistake I will make again.",

It was not crowded, the food arrived together and was just fine.  My hopes rose as we had not been back for months after three bad experiences.  Well, good was not to last.  Two more dinner occasions and the tastes were just \"off.\"  Their fusion is not working well.  The blends of shrimp, chicken and scollops tasted as if dish soap was mixed in.  Another evening, which my wife insisted we go back to eat, I ordered a simple pork fried rice and could only eat a small portion.  How do you screw up fried rice?  The pork was greasy, much of the rice hard and crunchy and it was gummy.  Ahhhhhh!  We will not be back.  How sad as the Charlotte location seemed to get it right, but I am not going back there for a comparison, either.  Bye, bye Red Bowl Indian Land.",

    "text": "2 stars because the food was OK.  This was the first time I ordered takeout from this place for our family and went out of my way because a friend told us about it. During the phone order I ask them if the dinner entrees came with pork fried rice, they said no. I then ordered 2 pork fried rice to go with our Entres. When I got home 15 minutes away I found two containers of pork fried rice and two containers of white rice. I was also missing some pot stickers for the order. I then called back to let them know about the missing food and to inquire about the fried rice. When I ordered I had asked if pork fried rice came with the entree they said NO. The second time I called to let them know the mistake they said they could do it for a $1 up charge. Wish this was communicated better the first time I called when I placed the order because this what I really wanted. NOT to spend almost an extra $20 on fried rice. I was also a bit surprised nothing was offered to me for the inconvenience of me going out of my way for forgotten food and having to drive back to get the rest of my missing order.  Now to review the food. Mongolian beef: good flavor, onions were super raw and not cooked enough.  Crab Rangoons: were good but lacking filling.  General Tso chicken: was cooked great and had great spice and flavor.  Pork Fried Rice: not worth the almost $20 extra than the $2 up-charge for what I wanted. But it was \"pork fried rice\"  Hot sour soup: good soup, tasted just like the soup we get at Cherry near lake Wiley.  Pot stickers: can't really review them because by the time I got back home from RedBowl the second time my family was already done with dinner and we put them in the fridge for leftovers.  Honestly I don't think we will give them another try. If some responsibility was taken by the person who took our order when I called back about the missing food and not said \"that's what you ordered\" & maybe offered us a free potsticker or something the next time we would order from them I think we would be more likely to give them another try.....",

We all know sushi can be expensive sometimes and buy one get one free! Who can go wrong with that?   Beer very cheap. 2.50 a bottle and imports 3.50. They also have omb for 3.50.  We got 2 plates of sushi and shareable appetizer and a vegetable noodle rice plate a beer and a soda and it was around 30 dollars. Very delicious food and they bring you a couple different sauces.  Wednesday night wasn't packed but it wasn't empty. They also have drink specials where imports are 2.50 on Wednesdays. Will definitely be back to this plate to eat some more and get more sushi. Sushi was big and very filling.",

Truth, I was super happy with my meal The amount of food I received could feed me for 4 meals. The sesame chicken has been by far my favorite yet. I have found that sesame chicken is much harder to come by around here and it actually be good.   So my issue and why I took 2 stars away. I had my kids with me they are 3 and 5. They both ordered chicken from the kids menu that came with rice and a side of ketchup. So my 3yr old decided on her last piece to dip it in ketchup... news flash... it was Siracha. My 3 year old was mistakenly given a side of Siracha instead of Ketchup. I didnt make a huge deal, shes a trooper and was OK. But my issues is when I told my waiter he was like Oh. Sorry.

He came to my table and stared at us until he decided to continue to the restroom. On his way back he stares again then goes and laughs with his kitchen friends. He acted as if he were mentally retarded. It was rude and I will never step foot in this establishment again.",

Without trashing the place I'll just say I've had better. Would I come back on my own accord, no. But if the seed wanted to, she can get whatever she wants from daddy. I think this location will stunt her culinary growth, but hey its Chinese/Sushi fusion in NC.",

    "text": "Honestly, sushi is overpriced and mediocre. I am a sushi fanatic and have been to every place around town and this one is my least favorite. Akahana has better sushi, pricing and taste. Also if you want to do the BOGO free sushi you CANT get it to go AND You HAVE to buy a drink to receive the deal, As other places they will still honor the free sushi and don't require drink purchase.   LASTLY, my mother got the pork and it was PURE FAT. Tasted terrible and was gross. She then ordered green curry chicken and they served her RED curry. This place is just mediocre.   UPDATE: SINCE THIS REVIEW... I was personally attacked by the GENERAL MANAGERS DAUGHTER, and the general manager. How disgustingly unprofessional. Not only do I not recommend the food, now GM  daughter will attack you on Facebook for a bad review.   I will name no names but I am still shocked at how disgusting the customer service is.",

    "text": "I was seriously impressed with the portion sizes vs. price at this restaurant. Every other bento box I have ordered has come with one selection per square in the box. At Red Bowl one of my selections was a house salad and instead of putting a small portion in with the rest of the bento box they brought me a large salad as a starter on a separate plate. The house dressing was delicious with the ginger being a little more subtle than usual.  The bento box itself had a full sushi roll and didn't skimp on the hibachi steak or vegetables. The fried rice that came with it was also full of vegetables and wasn't greasy. The hot tea I ordered came with two teabags in a large pot which meant I never had to ask our waitress for a refill.   All said the bento box was just under $13 and I left full and happy with the quality of the meal. We will definitely return!",

    "text": "I've been going here for years but will never go back now. They had a special BOGO on sushi (2nd roll of equal or lesser value free). We ordered four rolls $14, $13, $6, and $5. Bill came and they gave us the $6 and $5 roll free. I told them that I wanted to buy the $14 roll and get $13 free and likewise with the others.   Manager came to our table and just kept repeating that their interpretation of the offer was different than ours. Then she walked off and said she was calling the cops! This was outrageous.   I then requested they split our check with the $14 and $13 roll on the separate check. They continued to refuse and the manager actually called the cops. I didn't have time to wait for them to arrive, so I had to pay what they forced me to. Overall not a great dining experience.",

I ordered the Phoenix Maki roll which is described on their website as:  \"Phoenix Maki - spicy tuna topped with avocado, spicy mayo and masago.9.25\".  It had no Ahi / Tuna in it.   It was breading mixed with spicy sauce on the inside, also no masago.  This was a really big dissapointment for me, my coworker suggested this place as one of the better sushi spots.  I posted a pic to show what I got next to my order receipt. You can see no tuna, only breading with mayo inside.  And you can see no masago.   I'm so bummed.",
