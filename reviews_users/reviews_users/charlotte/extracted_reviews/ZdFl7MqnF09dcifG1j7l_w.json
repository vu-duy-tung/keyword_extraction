The JW Clay location in University City, Charlotte has changed this for the worse... Upon walking in, no one was at the podium, it was not busy at all, it took us 5 minutes to get greeted/seated. While my significant other & I were waiting, the staff were just openly chatting, look/acknowledged us, but continued to do what they were doing. After being seated and having drinks brought to us, they said it would be another 15 minutes to get our appetizers. After already waiting a long time, we lost our desire to eat there, got up & left, and went to Chick Fil A right across the parking lot & were served immediately. Applebee's could learn a lesson or two from competitors in the food industry.",

    "text": "I've visited this location many times in the past and the only thing that I have to say is \"This place has really fallen off.\"  One of the first things that you'll notice when you walk in on a weekend, is that the overall atmosphere of the place seems to be gloomy.  You just get the feeling that the people eating there aren't really enjoying themselves.  The food is really bad.  The riblets that I had during my last visit tasted like they were a few days old and had been microwaved, even the bones were dry and there was an odd freezer burned like taste.  My mother had a steak and after cutting into it and taking a bite, she swore that it had been microwaved.  We both had salads which seemed to be extremely small and were made with ingredients that were close to their expiration date (limp lettuce, slimy tomatoes, and old cheese).  I should also mention that the salads were served warm along with lukewarm dressing.  The overall service was nothing to really write home about (as the old saying goes).  Given the ratio of waitresses to customers, one would expect the service to be more prompt, but it wasn't.  The food also seemed to take a really long time to come out, about 45 mins for a steak with fries and riblets with fries, it may have actually been closer to an hour.  If you're in the area and in a bind to find something to eat, I recommend that you either find somewhere else to go or just save your money and hit one of the local grocery stores.  Since Applebee's is a chain, I don't think Kitchen Nightmares will be coming to save them :)",

    "text": "I gave one star because that is the lowest amount of stars you can give. This restaurant does not realize that there are too many restaurants in the immediate area for both the food and service to be subpar. The restaurant was fairly empty (approximately 7 occupied tables), however, the server was not attentive and slow to serve. She barely came to the table to check on us. She never once refilled our waters. And, she never cleared the table of the appetizer plates; we were eating our entrees and she never came back to clear the table of those plates. It was a crowded mess. Speaking of entrees- the sizzle plates that come with grilled orders were dirty. Dried cheese and muck from another diner were stuck to these plates. We advised the manager. His response was, \"well, the plates are supposed to get washed- there are two piles in the back, one clean and one dirty....sorry, you did not get clean ones.\" And, that was it. He did not offer to take the meals off the bill, or anything else. He said, \"thanks for the feedback,\" then he left. The food itself was eh. The spinach artichoke dip, which we would normally get, must be a new recipe. It was bad. We ordered two caesar salads, and she brought two house salads. Sure, she changed them- after we clicked that mechanism on the table that flashes, and then waiting another five minutes for her to reappear from some where and us vigorously flagging her down. The bread that came with an entree was like a brick- one bite was enough to determine that you could break your teeth on it. And the chicken that I ordered, had a funny taste. Needless to say, if you want a decent meal with at least decent service, DO NOT come to this restaurant.",

Let me preface by saying that I haven't been to an Applebee's in ages so the menu had been changed (probably several times) since I had last seen it and it was cool to see some new options on there.  Once we decided, the food came out pretty quickly.  We went with the 2 entrees and an app for $20... pretty decent deal for the portion sizes.  We split a spicy queso dip with chips and I got the new Florentine ravioli with chicken.     Overall good experience... the waitress was a little on the slow side (for the restaurant being dead).  It did pick up toward the end so maybe she got a little frazzled.",

When I arrived there were several servers standing around the bar area talking, I'm assuming because it was a slow night. I told the bartender that I was there to pickup an order and she decided that her conversation with her coworker was more important than serving a customer. I waited for about 10 minutes ( my requested pickup time at the time was about 15 minutes prior to this) and my food came out. I checked my order, and saw that I was missing a dessert (maple blondie to be exact) I told the bartender what I was missing, she whispered to who coworker who then decided to come over and take a look in my bag as if I wasn't telling the truth. I had to wait for another 10-15 minutes for them to prepare what I requested. I didn't receive an apology, or a thank you; I was just handed another bag. The food was subpar to say the least. I highly doubt we will be returning to this restaurant.",

The last time we visited this place it was so bad, we vowed NEVER to go back there again. We had to wait at least 30 minutes for a table but that wasn't our main complaint. It was a weekend, Saturday night to be exact, so we expected a wait. Once we were seated, we realized we were seated across from a family with a few unruly kids. No biggie because it happens from time to time. What really angered us was our scatter-brained waitress. She was totally inept. She couldn't even get our drink order right. That was our first sign that we weren't going to have a good meal. We ordered flavored lemonades. I asked to have mine with no ice. She returned with the drinks and I had gotten the wrong flavor and it had ice in it. I pointed out the mistake and she apologized and took it back. When she arrived for the second time, she had the flavor right but there was ice in it again. I decided to just let it slide. We ordered our dinners waited, and waited, and waited. It must have been 30 - 35 minutes before it came. She set our plates down and scurried off. She never even gave us silverware or napkins. We managed to flag down another waitress and asked for silverware and napkins. She went to go get them and never returned. After about 10 minutes a man came around checking on each table. I assumed he was a manager. We told him about the silverware and napkins and he apologized and brought them right away. At this time the bungling waitress comes over to ask if we needed anything. At that point we didn't. She went over to the next table and they complained about something and we heard her apologizing. She went to another table and they complained and we heard her apologizing again. Apparently she was screwing up orders at every table. We finished the meal, paid, and left without tipping. Be aware of this particular Applebee's because they always seem to have issues.",

My family and I (2 adults, 2 kids) decided to go to applebees tonight. We walk in, NOBODY greets us!! We wait for a good 10 minutes before someone even decides to come and seat us. There was maybe 7 cars in the parking lot. Nobody was sitting at the bar...NOT EVEN THE BARTENDER, and on a scale of 1-10, id say it was a 3 as far as how busy they were. A waitress came to a table close to the door TWICE before she turned around and sat us at our table. She came back and dropped our silverware off and left again. Nobody took our drink order or anything! After 20 minutes of just sitting there. My family and I got up and left!!!! As we walked out. We walked past two employees that were just standing gossipping at the bar and 1 employee who was on her way to another table. My family and I are new to the Charotte area and we will NEVER go back to this establishment. Every employee on the shift of June 7th at 7:50PM needs to be FIRED!!!!! Point blank period. They were NOT busy at all and SEVERAL employees were literally just standing around gossipping. NEVER AGAIN!",

However,  reluctantly (yes,  I admit it) I must confess that it wasn't all that bad.  Our server wasn't the best,  she looked like she couldn't be more bothered.  But I guess after she sensed we were ok peeps she let her guard down a bit.  Our food came at a reasonable time and my salad was pretty dang on good!  Was it my favorite place?  Nah,  but I can't say I'd never go back.  The Maple Brownie makes all the pain go away every time...",

My family member was assaulted last night and no one who worked there did anything.  The women who dragged her around by her hair and made her fall out her chair at the bar had been there for FOUR HOURS DRINKING. the bar tender was laughing and did nothing!! This makes me believe this lady is a regular.  Management did nothing last night!! I called this morning and the manager on duty said \"I wasn't working so this has nothing to do with me\". Excuse me but if you have a manager title it has something to do with you whether you were working or not!! I am contacting ALE and have already contacted applebees customer care. I worked in a bar for years and having heard about this the women shouldn't have been served anymore. Many other patrons said she was overly intoxicated and becoming mouthy. I would not spend a penny here!!!",

The manager was talking out loud at the bar to some employee about checking their schedule. Very inappropriate to do in front of customers out loud in an open space. Very unprofessional. The food improved but still lacking consistency with the seasoning. Chicken was not seasoned and potatoes were bland no flavor. Abryana, our server was good, but nothing exceptional.",

They go because its upscale fast food, they can sit and have a beer, and there are TVs. Appetizers are good anywhere you go, and grabbing a quick burger and fries is all any Applebees is ever really good for.  Walked into the smallest waiting area I've ever seen in a sit-down establishment. 4 couples ahead of me and my wife...wait time is 10-15 minutes. Not bad right?  10 minutes go by and none of the couples before us have been seated. 3 couples have come in behind us in the meantime, and guess what their wait time is? 10-15 minutes according to the seasoned champion they had working as a Hostess. I start looking around and see an ample amount of tables empty...I start wondering, why the hell am I still waiting to be seated?  The second hand strikes 12 as we entered minute 15, and a gaggle (real word...look it up) of employees decide to stop their entire evening to go do a birthday song...at Applebees. With a lobby full of customers waiting to be seated...  It's 2016, isn't it common knowledge by now that no one has a birthday at Applebees? They just tell their waitress that as a joke to publicly embarrass the people they are with.  Needless to say, we walked out.  What a joke! This place has permanently lost my patronage.",

Been to Applebee's before and honestly they have not been great, but this was by far the worst ever. Should have checked Yelp first!  We were seated by the hostess quickly , good start right? Wrong. We sat for over 15 minutes with many servers passing us including the one assigned to our table. Another server we had not seen stopped by and asked if we had been helped. He took our drink order and was extremely pleasant. Waitress delivered our water and drinks then nothing further for about ten minutes. Ordered and received our food my wife ordered the Asian salad and started eating and when she got to the bottom of the bowl a hair was at the bottom. Called manager and he came over. Not very customer service oriented. My wife had to ask if the salad would be compensated after he asked if she would like something else to which he responded, sure apologized and left. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.",

When the food got there it wasn't everything together, while waiting my kids meal to get to him when I arrive I just so happen to tap the hard burnt bun turned the bun over and saw the burger was covered in hard burnt cheese. I was livid, I asked to speak to a manager and her apologies wasn't sympathetic enough for my comfort and all was done was a comp of a $2 meal.

Even the steak sauce couldn't cover the disgusting taste... my fries were also burnt, and the broccoli was horrible, too!

Fast forward to today, I placed an order online for the salad and a soup while at the gym. I plugged in for it 12:00pm pick up. I arrived around 11:45 and had no problem waking until 12. 12:10 nothing...12:15 he comes out with the receipt to sign and will bring the food out when it's ready. Really? It's soup and a wedge salad. Literally a hunk of lettuce. 12:30 and this is the salad they bring out. No bacon and barely any toppings. I knew my one experience Wednesday night was too good to be True.  Update 9/16- tried again. Again a fail on the curbside to go. Ordered the green goddess wedge and southwest steak and black bean soup. This time when the server brought it out it had only bacon on it. I asked about the bleu cheese and pecans and he asked like I was asking for something that doesn't go on the salad. When I get home I realize the salad has ranch. I called and the manager said I could bring it back or have a gift card mailed. I said I would bring it back but decided to suck it up and eat it. Fast forward to midnight and I'm ready to eat my southwest steak and black bean soup but I notice the steak tastes a lot like chicken. Wait a minute it is chicken and it's not southwest black bean anything. More like some kind of chicken tortilla with rice. I'll be making a trip to Applebee's tomorrow.   If I could take away my one star I would.",

We stood there for approximately 5 minutes before anyone came and seated us. After the guy seated us, 5 minutes went by, 10 minutes went by, 15 minutes went by. NO ONE ELSE CAME!!! Finally I got up and went to the bar to ask the bartender for two glasses of water with lemon. The bartender states: no one came to help to you guys yet? I said: no but can I have two glasses of water until they come? Bartender: let me go get them Me: waiting for my water..... no water. He dismiss me and said they will come. By this time I'm furious!! Finally a waiter came and asked the craziest thing have we been helped! I said no!! He is apoplectic and ect... but I don't care. Saying how they are short handed and stuff.  My thing is communication! The first guy who sat us knew they were short could have said something! communicate to your customers . So I asked to speak to the manager. Manager never came! And we never got out water.  So we left and gave our business across the street to Friday's!!!",

I should've left the food there, hopefully I won't get sick. I'll definitely be calling their corporate office to beg them to bulldoze the place.

This morning, the staff and manager allowed a customer to sit at the bar and play his Pandora playlist from his phone on full volume. After several comments to our waiter, the self identified DJ wasn't address nor did his music stop. My group was very disappointed in the lack of leadership displayed in addressing an activity that was impacting the entire restaurant. He played his playlist like a hired DJ and not one employee said anything. It wasn't until I asked whom the manager on duty was that the waiter seemed concerned. It was an hour and 20 minutes too late. I will not be  returning to Applebee's... Friday's is a cross the street.",

First, the host (who told us our wait would be twenty minutes even though the restaurant seemed to be at less than half capacity) was clearly annoyed by the fact that he had to wipe down a booth to fit our party of five.  Then, our waitress (who I would call unenthusiastic at best) waited fifteen minutes after we ordered to tell us they were out of the meat needed to make one of the dishes we wanted. So, after reordering, half of our party's food arrived way before the rest. We also ordered a round of their $1 drink special, but declined a second round as they tasted like watered down juice with little to no alcohol in them. The only bright side of this experience was the food. It tasted good and was hot when it arrived (though at vastly different times). My only complaint on that part was that the pretzels we received were a tiny bit doughy in the middle. To top it all off, our bill was incorrect the first time around and needed to be fixed before we could pay. We begrudgingly paid the waitress her 15% tip with no plans to return to that place again.   Overall the food here is satisfactory but, unless you're looking to stand around for a while just to be greeted and waited on by bored and annoyed looking staff, I suggest you try another restaurant.",

Walk in, the hostess doesn't say a word and just head nods is in a direction, after a waitress comes up to him and says \"I don't want anymore tables\".. we walk up to a table and he just sets the menus down and walked away.  Server comes up: complains how he's so busy when there's only six tables occupied in the whole place. He grabs our drink orders and when we try to order appetizers he says he can't take anymore of our order cause he's too busy... Comes back with our drinks takes our orders while complaining about his day and how he can't wait to go home and smoke a bowl and the leaves... we decided not to even order an appetizer because we figured it would take too long..  We get our food and he says it's been in the kitchen ready to be delivered he just hasn't had time... we haven't even seen him on the floor attending other tables...  I'm just so shocked",

Let me first off by saying this, my boyfriend and I are both waiters so we understand taking a quick break. When we initially pulled into the parking lot we saw 2 servers smoking in the back. We joked about it in the car and went in. Once inside we waited a few minutes for the host to come from the back. She could have easily been taking dishes to the back, who knows. But what irritated me from the start was that she was looking around to see who to seat. It wasn't busy at all and it seemed to be maybe 3 servers on with about 2 tables each. Then we get to our table and sit there for 20 mins waiting to be greeted. A waitress walked pass our table twice and just looked at us. Not a word was said, no drink orders were taken. NOTHING. My boyfriend joked and said she might still be out back smoking. There were 2 other tables who also didn't receive any service. Inevitably we ended up leaving and going to Chili's. NEVER coming back to this location",

Told me that they didn't have my Togo order after I made it over an hour ago. And when I called they said they didn't even have my name down and the food hadn't been ready. The manager passed us twice before even acknowledging us and the entire establishment seemed to not know how to run itself at all. The bartender's seemed sloppy in their orders and it just is overall sloppy. Needs help with everything. Did not enjoy my time at all.",
