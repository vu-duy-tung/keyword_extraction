    "text": "I was craving a philly cheese steak and penn station does it the very best! Their meat is used from rib eye steak and they shave it using a meat slicer grill it on the flat top you get your choice of veggies and sauce. Theirs also different sizes of subs I got the six inch with a small order of fries. The fries do taste fresh there Idaho potato blanched in water then fried in peanut oil. I would recommend this place there's monthly specials where you get a sub chips and drink for $6.99",

Very nice and friendly gentleman. My son and I usually get the same sandwich because to Us it's perfection. The Italian with a  side of fries for us to split. Great place. Love the new location. Looking forward to many more visits.",

It is True that it may take a little longer to get your sub here than at another sandwich place, but the quality that Penn Station produces simply cannot be replicated.",

    "text": "I was very hungry and craving a good philly style sandwich from a place that specialises in such masterpieces. No need for confusion, or asking for any specialty items, I simply said just make it the way you make it! Big mistake. Very hungry and short on time for lunch I get back to my truck and find that my Philly sandwich has tomato sauce on it. Please read this little insert on how to make an original Philly that I found:  In general, tomato sauce is not a regular part of a cheesesteak when served in Philadelphia. (A \"pizza steak\" with mozz and marinara is a popular thing, but it's not the same.)   You know it was very low portions in there was hardly any meat, a lot of sauce and a lot of peppers. Heartburn City, I will never make this mistake again there's plenty of other delicious places to get a Philly in Charlotte.",
