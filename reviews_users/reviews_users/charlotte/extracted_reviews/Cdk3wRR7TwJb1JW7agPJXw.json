For being a beer place, i expected garagey/sporty or just very relaxed atmosphere. If was more of an awkward club like feeling with blue lights. Staff were not the most friendly. I don't intend on returning. I'll make the haul to Duckworth's instead.",

Along with everything thing else they make in house. This is a foodies dream. For apps the mini burgers are going to melt in your mouth. Seriously no need to chew this one, or all 3. I mean it has candied bacon jam on them them. The pork belly is also heavy served with kimichi. Also homemade. Avocado fries, I don't know how they get them to be just like potato fries but these things pack some flavor and crisp! You also don't feel so bad because it's avocado :) roasted Brussels sprouts are not bad either, and I am not a fan of Brussel sprouts. So anyone that can get me to eat them is a plus in my book. The best thing a foodie can do is go with a friend or more and just order the menu and all share. Because everything here is good.",

    "text": "What a pleasant surprise!  We came here expecting mediocre bar food, but it was late and we were hungry...they were open!! :)   EVERYTHING we ate was delicious!  We got the avocado fries app.  They were great, but the sauce that came with them was spicy and soooo good, we had to save it to use on the herb fries.    I got the portabello burger.  It was so yummy!  What a delicious combination!  I got it with sweet potato fries; they were sprinkled with sugar and came with a sweet dip.  John got the steak sandwich with the herb fries.  He loved his sandwich and liked his fries alright.  He was really loving that sauce that came with the avocado fries, so they gladly brought him some more.  Everything about this place was great and totally unexpected!  The ONLY thing negative to me, was it was just a tad too dark in there.  I know it was almost 9, but just a bit more light would have been great.  I have really good vision and it was a little hard to read things.  That was a very small thing though and didn't at all hurt our overall experience.  We will definitely be going here for our late night meals!!  UPDATE:   We went back for more and had a fairly crummy experience.  The food was still great, but the atmosphere was lacking!  I'm hoping it was just a bad night.  A girl was in there screaming...blood-curdling-someone-is-trying-to-kill-me screams every few minutes at the bar.  How is this acceptable?  I mentioned it to my server, who seemed annoyed by it as well, but she was happy to make the excuse that it was her 21st.  I would have NEVER behaved like that somewhere public...much less at 8:45pm!!!!  Seriously?  I was appalled that they hadn't handled the situation better.  If I was the manager, I would have politely thanked her for coming to my establishment, but asked her to please not ruin the experience for our other guests and refrain from screaming.  If she did it again, I would ask her to leave.  Also, they probably should have cut her off if she couldn't keep it together!  Needless to say I was quite agitated.  We ate quickly and left as fast as possible. :-/",

The bartender was good and friendly as can be but the beer list was pretty garbage tbh.   There were a couple of good beers. Quantity does not = Quality. The appetizers were really tasty though. 5-10 years ago their beer list would have been considered really good but at this stage in the beer game, if your name is Pint, you need to deliver with good beers. Went to go see the outside and was alerted that there was a private party going on. (Which happened to be the waitresses friends) Maybe a work event? Either way it wasn't a good experience. I'd be happy to consult with the beverage manger but it seems they are looking to push cheap locals and PBR. Doesn't really seem right with the name and all.",

    "text": "Maybe this was an off day but it was arguably one of the worse places I've gone to. I will agree that we had 11 people in our party, but the place was completely empty when we got there. Even when we left, there were only 3 other tables of 4 people or less.   It all starts with the drinks taking about 10 mins to come out after we ordered. Then our plates started coming out(25 mins later) very staggered. My friend's and mine's sides came out 15 minutes before everyone else's meal. Once our food came out, it seemed the chef had overlooked a second order of wings so one person had to wait an extra 10mins. I understand that food lateness is not the server's fault, however; she never went out of her way to ensure us that the food was coming or that they were running behind. She would only let us know when we would get tired of waiting and would go ask at the bar.   The seasonal veggies were awesome, but the Cauliflower Bites were pretty atrocious. It seemed they were sitting in oil for too long, or the oil wasn't hot enough because some parts were so saturated with oil(yes, I know they were battered and fried) that I felt that I was applying a layer of chapstick. They would be better suited to just fry seasoned cauliflower pieces and toss them in a sauce like Fern and Bean does.   I do give credit where credit is due. My gross cauliflower was taken off the bill as well as fixing a price error on another person's check.",

They offer half price small plate apps before 7pm on Thursdays, which is an incredible deal, and they have regular beer specials.  The servers are usually friendly, though at times a little slow.

Our server, Antoinetta, was eager and friendly.  However, they were out of several beers.  Antoinetta could not describe some of the menu items well.  The food was uneven - the Choripan sandwich was amazing, but the pork belly was disappointing.   I am confident that they will figure out their ordering, the servers will become better trained, and they will figure out how to make the menu better when they see what sells.  In the meantime, friendly service and a sweet vibe are enough to give this spot another chance.  Definitely check out the back patio.",

The menu seemed to have some great selections at a good price, but this is where the praise ends.  I ordered the Choripan, an Argentinian sausage sandwich with chimichurri sauce. On the side, sweet potato fries. My fiance had a grilled turkey sandwich, and her brother, the breakfast burger. We also had a couple of apps.  Our food arrived quickly and hot, the sweet potato fries were delicious. My fiance really liked her turkey sandwich. Everything else we received was salted so incredibly heavily I almost couldn't finish eating it, and I'm not one to waste food. If they cut the salt back by about 40-60% and the seasoning on their garlic fries back just a touch, it would have been a much better experience. I can't say I'd go back, unless just for some beers, because the food was just far too salty and I'm not a picky eater.",

Sign up front says wait to be seated but every time I've come it takes forever for a host to come up front. I will say the hosts looked like they had their hands full though as they were running around filling water and running food and drinks all night. After be sat it takes AT LEAST 10 minutes to be greeted by a server and once you order you're lucky to see them again until you manage to flag them down to get the bill. Place has horrible acoustics as well, pretty much can't hear anyone talking unless their right next to you screaming in your ear.   Would recommend this place as a bar but not as a restaurant. The food is pretty decent and the beer list is huge and has some of everything on it. It'd be a great place to grab a couple beers and a snack and sit on the nice patio for a chill night but I wouldn't recommend as a dinner place.",

Bar atmosphere review: The indoor area has lots of seating and a long bar. The outdoor back patio area is also pretty neat- check that out if the weather is nice. They are also dog friendly. The dinner crowd were 20-somethings, trendy, slightly hipster and not too loud. The night scene is louder and gets more crowded but the wait time for drinks isn't too long in my experience  Food review: The chicken poppers were good, not spicy at all, slightly overpriced for 4 poppers. The breakfast burger is big, if you're not starving you could get an app, split the burger and that could be a decent meal for two girls. It didn't blow me away like other \"breakfast-style\" burgers I've had in the past, but it tasted good. The buffalo wings at the bar are SPICY! I enjoy spicy food, and usually don't even find buffalo wings that hot, but these are red-hot! If you're into that, you'll love these but if you just like a normal buffalo wing these may be too much unless you drown them in ranch/bleu cheese. Good wings though, lots of meat on the bone and not much fat.",

Chicken sliders have a delicious jam and cheese that makes them stand apart from other sliders.  The avocado fries are perfectly done, get these and try to keep them to yourself.

I'd assume more of a Flying Saucer or even a Salud with a name like Pint Central, but its more of a tapas bar with some good beers on tap.    The food is great, lots of little bites of all sorts and sizes.  I've nibbled on all kinds of dishes, but the avocado fires seem to be the standout to me.  I can attest to other reviewers liking the avocado eggrolls and the brussel sprouts, too. I'm honestly not a fan of the Chimichurri Beef Tips, but after living with some Argentinians for a while, I'm pretty picky.  I need to hit up some sandwiches for lunch some time, all sound great and under $10.  As per the food though, I do like most of it and its not too pricey for the area, but there are at least 2-3 other places within stumbling distance that have pretty good tapas as well.  I don't know if there is enough room for everyone in Plaza Midwood.  I wish them all luck.  They don't have the largest tap selection in town by any means, but plenty of great options.  I always love my Sculpin, even though its no where close to local.  I love the fact that they have Higher Ground, Bird Song's Jalapeno pale, and NoDa's Hop Drop and Roll.  I've only had a couple, but great cocktails as well.  I'll hopefully report back on that real soon.  Oh yeah, I didn't really go over the layout, but you can get that from other reviews.  An FYI though, there is a chill area out back!  This isn't my first choice as per going out and grabbing some beers, as I can find cheaper booze close by.  It is a great place to get some good eats without a pretentious vibe.",

Sadly, not today..We appeared to be the first customers at around 11:15(11:00 open) Right off the bat the waitress tells us that they \"are running a little behind setting up\"..No problem..we are 2 today, we order 1 app and 2 burgers..The app, Avocado fries comes out timely, slightly over fried(coating) but  tasty..So far so good..Again, we are the only party in the place.. at this point, the guy behind the bar rips a HUGE burp..Hey, cover your mouth!! LOL Waitress brings out burgers, immediately apologizes for the delay, stating,\"It's are new cooks first day\"!! I felt it wasn't that long so ensured her all was good..She then gave us 2 practically empty(literally)ketchup bottles stating, \"it's all I can find\"..So i dive into my fries, room temperature at best, small broken pieces of what should have been curly fries...My burger's (breakfast burger)egg cooked so well done , no runny yolk, burger way overcooked..Now if only I had a decent amount of ketchup to remedy this..My son's burger, (Korean burger) was alleged to come with \"Pork Belly\"..I don't know where they get their \"Pork Belly\" but the meat atop his burger was clearly a very thick slice of bacon!! Not bad albeit, but to advertise \"Pork Belly\" and give someone bacon??? And his side, a BLT salad listed \"topped with Avocado\"..What was indeed on the salad was a dollop of Ice Cold guacamole..Now to be clear, we did not say anything to the waitress at first(Hey, it was the \"new\" chef's first day) because we are were on a schedule, had a Groupon and despite the discrepancies with the burgers, they tasted fine(Korean better then the Breakfast) When the waitress came to take the Groupon(not asking if we wanted anything else etc) she asked how things were..I was hoping to just escape at that point but told her the fries were certainly underwhelming, not the right temperature and nothing but broken pieces ..She did ask if we would like a new batch but I declined, then she went on to say that it was the new cooks first day on his own and he was \"overwhelmed\" and he wasn't left with anything set up....1 app, 2 burgers? Not a single other customer in sight? What is going to happen at the height of their service today? She also stated the fries were made spiral in house and that them breaking into little pieces when they were fried was the norm..Hmmm..I then asked, is that really all the ketchup you have in the entire restaurant? \" She replied, \"I'm sorry , I can't find the key for the shed\" Enough said...But in the end, I did indeed leave her a tip for approx 16 % of the full bill before Groupon..My tip to Pint Central, Get your act together!!!",

Fast service, fabulous food, great hostess & server, gigantic draft & bottle beer menu, featuring several NC & even Charlotte brews...fabulous wine selection...w/ half price glass & bottle night on Monday. We even got to meet one of the owner/manager's at the end as we left & he thanked us for coming. I noticed 2 managers circulating while we were there, checking in w/ the front often.   Went on a Friday @ 7, so obviously expected a wait since it was new & a wknd. Place was packed & hostess was super nice....went to the bar to wait & grab a drink. Didn't even have time to order before a table was ready for us, which was unexpected! Ordered several tapas: avocado fries, BBQ wings, avocado egg rolls & the pork belly. All excellent!! The pork belly is to die for. Husband got several different draughts (they were out of several, but there were plenty others to pick from), I got a few Malbec's. Server Anastasia was great & very fast...very attentive in a good way! We were shocked with how busy it was that our food came out so fast.   Only complaint would have to be the noise level. Very loud in there & hard to hear anything, unless you're practically yelling. They actually had jazz playing , but it was barely heard. It was really crowded, but I guess that's a good sign for a new place! Several TV's with sports on. They have a big  patio out back w/ tables. I plan on being out there once the weather gets nice.   Overall....5 stars! Love it & happy to have them in the 'hood now!!",

The menu has a variety of options for everyone/all dietary needs.  I usually grab a few tapas but if you are looking for a sandwich I recommend the Mushroom.  It is a portabella grilled with balsamic and a GENEROUS portion of mozzarella cheese (parm fries are a must as the side- loaded with garlic and delicious!).  I usually go the tapas route and grab a few sides/small plates.  Hard to go wrong but the Pesto Brussels sprouts are always a must order!",

    "text": "Good addition to the neighborhood.  I like that I can walk here, get slammed off $4 Jameson and $2 PBR, then continue my journey to wherever the night takes me.  They have plenty of TV's for game watching and a very clean, refreshing atmosphere that seems even more so when you glance across the street at the Thirsty Beaver.  There's also a garage door they can open up towards the back that gives the end of the bar a great view of the Uptown skyline.  As far as the food goes, I'd give it a 3.5.  I've eaten here twice and mostly shared small plates.  It doesn't touch the quality of a few other restaurants in the hood, but I also didn't see a dish on the menu over $15.  My favorites were probably the mozzarella bites (not your traditional cheese sticks), avocado egg rolls, fried avocado, and chicken poppers (ask for ranch or blue cheese, blew my mind it wasn't served with a sauce).  As you can tell, we didn't get too far past the apps, but for the flavor and price point it was a good value.  The entrees were reasonably priced and looked good too.  Giving the entrees a try would provide a better gauge on the food as a whole, but I think this place is a solid 4.",

    "text": "What bar food should taste like. No frozen mozzarella sticks here. Try something you wouldn't normally order on their menu and you will be impressed with the fresh twist Pint Central adds.  I had an $8 Sour Silly in a bottle ($8) super tasty but a bit much for a beer in a bottle. Draft's were between $4.50 and $7.  There are two outdoor outdoor areas and plenty of casual seating on the inside. There is a sharp contract between the atmosphere and the food served.  Brussels Sprouts have been raved about on Yelp and the pesto is unexpected - it is also a larger portion for the tapas section of the menu.  Also would recommend the pork belly, chimicurri steak and the mozzarella bites.  The portions and food quality were good for the price point. Overall takeaway: I would eat there again for high quality bar fare. Highly recommend dinner here then heading across the street to FuManChu cupcakes for dessert after. Stellar combo.",

    "text": "What an interesting find - a super casual bar/patio with \"upscale\" food! The fella and I visited on a Wednesday night and got spots right in front, which made me think it was gonna be a good night.  We sat inside but the garage doors were up, so it still felt like we were outside (especially with the number of flies and gnats circling our glasses - ugh). The patio looked pretty inviting, too. The concrete floors inside and super loud music/acoustics made a little nervous, but they eventually turned down the music.  Our waitress was awesome. We changed a drink order at the last minute, and she wasn't rattled; we asked for recommendations, and she steered us in the right direction.  We tried some of the tapas and got - in order of most delicious to least - the chicken sliders, brussels sprouts (yes, they're #2!), lamb lollipops, and chicken poppers. The poppers and lollipops were good but a little overcooked. The chicken sliders and sprouts were so good, I could've licked the bowl.  I'm not a huge beer person, but I was excited to see a couple of ciders on tap and sours in a bottle, and the fella who looooves beer, was really impressed to see the La Fin Du Monde on tap.",

Passed it around for all 4 of us to try it and everyone said the same thing. Bad beer. So when we voiced that she would like another, they ended up charging us for both. Never heard of a restaurant that charges you for something you do not consume and are disatisfied with.. especially a beer! Do not recommend this place under any circumstances.. even when all the good bars are too packed to get into. Better off staying at home.",

    "text": "This review is based solely on one specific experience. I should preface that by saying that this is a place I come to for dinner at least once every month or two.   I love lots of things about Pint Central but the experience we had tonight just plain sucked. The restaurant was not crowded (maybe 1/3 full, max) but service was extremely, extremely slow. No apologies or explanation when it took several minutes from when we sat down till we first saw our server (that's fine, it happens) and no apologies or explanation when it took 35+ minutes to get our food (basic sandwiches from the menu, nothing tricky whatsoever). We didn't see our server at all between ordering the food and then getting it 35+ minutes later. That part is not cool - I definitely would have liked to have our presence/status of the food/drink refills at least recognized. Once the meals finally came, the server asked if we'd like any sauces on the side and recommended a horseradish aioli among other things. We agreed to try that and a couple others. When the bill came, each sauce had a $.50 up charge. That is fine to charge for sauces - but not cool to not tell us up front! The whole experience was just super disappointing. I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the food was mostly fine when it did come out. I will say that about half of the roasted potatoes were undercooked but by that point I was so hungry that I didn't really care.   Will I go back? Maybe. I love supporting local places in the neighborhood, but Pint Central needs to up their game if they want to build/keep loyal customers.",

    "text": "I had to update my review on this place because wow how things have changed in the year that I was gone! Trivia night ok awesome should have a good crowd. We decided to stop in for a few beers not the trivia as I was in the office late.  Bartenders could not be more apathetic in this place. After standing politely at the bar (which was full with trivia players, but not customers asking for drinks) for over five minutes, I had to waive down a bartender. I'm not standing here for fun, I'm standing here waiting to be acknowledged. Asked for a beer list to which the bartender obliged, but had to go find one (another two minutes of waiting) then instead of letting me quickly read over it he disappeared again. The whole process of ordering a beer when no one else was waiting was literally a 10 minute ordeal. Then to make matters worse, prices have gone up here so I paid $7 for a beer I could get for $4.50 next door at Moo and Brew. Don't get me wrong I wouldn't mind paying a bit more for the same beer if the ambiance and service matched the up charge, but it didn't. The bartender was unenthused handling me the beer and when I said 'thank you' didn't even bother to respond.  But wait...there is more. Went out to the patio for a more quiet atmosphere the waitress stops by after a few shots of tequila to ask if we wanted anything else. I asked if she could bring another beer list and she responds that she is going to change a few of the kegs quickly and will be right back. Ok....two thoughts on this: 1.) bring me a list now, so I can look over it while you are changing the kegs 2.) this was an opportunity for you to sell me a beer already on tap while you changed kegs and lines and then sell me a second one based on saying its a freshly tapped keg. Needless to say the girl never came back with a beer list or my friends tequila shot.   Also, note to management your staff lost the tab and instead of trying to clear the air they walked around asking each other frantically what we had to drink. Why not just approach us, fess up to the mistake (they happen, no big deal), and ask us what we had. Instead they put together a bill that was completely inaccurate.   I heard through the grapevine that this place has new ownership (may or may not be True), but my advice would be to have a staff training ASAP. There are way too many bars in Charlotte with staff who at least act like they want to be there and value you as a customer for me to frequent an establishment where clearly I was not valued as a customer or a human being for that matter.",

HOWEVER- i came here today with a group of people around 6pm on a Sunday. The very sweet waitress informed us she forgot to turn off the sign. We asked why they were closing so early. She informed us no one showed up for their shift and not even management was picking up. This left her alone in the bar with 12 people. We were quick to order and it helped out since we all wanted draft beer. She was nervous, but a great server despite her being the only one here. It's awful a good place like Pint Central will close early on a Sunday simply because their employees and employER will not show up. Please get it together for the love of chimichurri.",

My wife and I stopped by around 2 P.M. on a Friday and the place was basically dead. We had the entire back deck to ourselves which was great for our dog. Beer selection was great, both cans and draft. It took a while for the server to get our food order. We ordered the brussel sprouts as an appetizer, and they seemed to be steamed instead of char-grilled with some parmesan. Not good. I had the Choripan sandwich which had good flavor but was super greasy. Yuca fries were ok. The wife had the breakfast burger which was decent. The hash brown (think McDonalds hash brown) didn't add much to the burger, and the egg on it was overcooked. Parmesan fries were ok. Pint Central essentially combines great ambiance and beer selection with mediocre food and service.",

While the one guy behind the bar proceeded to talk with 2 of the customers for 10 minutes he lost out on the 9th and 10th customers of the night. I had a few more minutes of patience in me.

Me and my fiance walked in at 1pm on Sunday with 4 people at the bar and no one else. The bar tender told us to sit anywhere, we opted for the bar, and then waited for service. It took him a few minutes to come over but he brought waters and menus. After that, he disappeared. We waited for at least 5 minutes and he was no where to be found. We ultimately decided to leave and probably won't be back.",

The Cheese bites were ok but strangely wet inside so when you cut or bit into them they would squirt all over the place.  They had red peppers which I'm not a fan of but not overwhelming.  The french fries were good.  Thin curls with plenty of garlic and parmesan...very tasty.  It said they cane with garlic aioli but ours came with ketchup which was fine.  A decent selection of craft & bottled beers.  The Unibroue was very good.    I think I'd try it again.",

I could easily order $40 worth of food for myself.   Creative tapas plates. I love the avocado egg rolls and the Brussels Sprouts. The Brussels are a good sized dish that is good for sharing. Mozzarella bite rangoons are also tasty. The basil, roasted pepper and balsamic glaze are a great combination. Typical prices for tapas style plates.  I want to try a lot more on this menu. There's a beet panini on there calling my name. It sounds delicious. The NoDa Jam Session Bread Pudding sounds like something I also need in my life. Bunch of TVs here. This would be a nice spot to watch a game. The patio is pretty cool. There's a roll up garage door so you can order without waking back inside.   Hunter is great behind the bar. He's there almost every day. Seriously, when does this guy get a day off? He's such a hard worker. Super nice.   Congrats to the crew here on a solid spot in Plaza Midwood.",

Been here five times, and my most challenging task is choosing dinner from many great selections.  Brussel sprouts and garlic shrimp are incredible; cauliflower and park sliders also excellent.  Or choripan and a salad!   Everything is great, so don't skip the food!  My original yelp tip underestimated beer selections at Pint Central.  Not only were there 35 draft selections tonight, but twice that many in bottles and cans also.  Carlos always comes around and says \"Hello.\". Friendly touch.  Servers always remember me, are always welcoming, and very easy to talk with.  I suggest dumping the chain restaurants and giving your business to Pint Central instead.",

For the main entree I had the Churrasco with fries as my side, they were really good too. They put Parmesan cheese on them. I ordered it medium rare but it came out medium well. Can't expect it to be perfect because it's not a steak house but it was flavorful. The bartender was nice. They didn't have a lot of people when I was there but they got a few orders to go.

Bartenders rock it and save this place.  Nice to have vegan options around the corner from my house.   There is a reason why it's empty most of the time. Which is a shame.",

The beer list is very extensive and the menu is packed with goodies. The waitstaff is very friendly and helpful but we did had some issues getting the food out all at once. I had the shrimp tacos that weren't my favorite.  With all that said, I wasn't going to give PC a five star review.... but! The reason I am is because of the owner. After seeing my post of the picture of the shrimp tacos and my comment, he came over to the table to talk to me personally and apologized for the tacos and the service.  For this, I will give PC 5 stars and return again! Businesses that are willing to learn and grow from mistakes are the best places to frequent!",

    "text": "Pint Central is a hidden gem in Charlotte. I went on Saturday night for a birthday dinner; we were with a pretty big group (around 15) and the group leader called ahead. Pint Central had a table set up for us when we arrived, which was really awesome!   When you walk in, you're in a big open space with a long bar on the right. It's got a clean feel, not real divey like some of the other spots in Plaza. They also have an outdoor area in the back, but it was too cold to be out there.  Pint Central does have a lot of beers on tap, but not as many as you may think given the name. We came for a late dinner, so I ate some snack at home beforehand because I was so hungry. I ended up order a small plate - the caprese - as my meal. It was DELICIOUS. It was sliced avocado topped with tomatoes, basil, their homemade mozzarella, and a balsamic glaze (see photo). The burgers looked delicious. I tried my fiance's parmesan fries... OH MY GOSH. They were so good.   The only reason I rate Pint Central 4 stars instead of 5 is because it took a really long time to get our checks. Now, I do recognize that were in a big group, there was a groupon, there were multiple separate checks and some couples paying together --- a lot going on. It just seemed a little too long, even given the circumstance. Other than that, our service was great throughout the dining experience.  ANYWAY, I will definitely be back to Pint Central and I highly recommend it to others. Yum!",

I waited quite a while for a vodka soda, which was super weak. I almost wasn't sure there was any vodka in it. My husband ordered a Jim Beam and diet coke, but the diet coke was flat.

I use to go to Pint Central a lot....  multiple times a week - sometimes for lunch (by myself or with a friend) and for dinner with my wife.  The service used to be excellent, as was the food - both the sammichs and the small plates.  A year or more ago the food was fantastic - all of it, and the service was friendly.  I can remember ordering a caesar at lunch and adding shrimp - the bartender would ask if I wanted the shrimp blackened or not....  when the salad came out, it was once of the best caesars I've ever had - with six big, beautiful shrimp on top.  When I was there a month ago, that same caesar came out and it was a different story - it wasn't fresh, the shrimp were TINY, and to be honest, I've had better salads at Hooters....   and Hooters is not exactly known for their salads.  :)  I don't know what happened....  but this place went from being awesome to basically sucking.  I hope they figure it out and can return it to its former glory.",

I ordered a French 75- which he apparently did not know how to make or apparently want to make because i explained to the server it was only gin, simple syrup, lemon juice or sour mix and prosecco or champagne. Ingredients every bar has or should have. First of all the fact he couldnt be bothered to even Googe it was annoying and then I was told that the bar did not have the ingredients for the drink.    Clearly this bartender just didnt want to make this very simple drink. I am a wine bar manager and when we get a drink order we are not familiar with, we look it up and make it if at all possible.      This was a very negative experience and your bartender needs to be taught about cuatomer service. Jodi Helm",

I was originally pumped to find Pint Central - finally, a place with decent food where I can watch a sports event (in this case, the NCAA tournament)! The food was pretty good. I really enjoyed the baked provolone, and the mushroom flatbread is worth ordering as well.   Unfortunately, the service and beer availability was severely lacking. Our poor waitress was literally running around trying to accommodate all of her tables, and she had continuous issues with the bar serving up her/our drinks in a timely fashion. Additionally, they were out of several beers listed on their menu that we tried ordering. I could have understood one or two being out, but there were at least four beers listed that had kicked.  The waitress was really sweet and did a wonderful job, and she even discounted some of the food/drinks that took a long time to come out. I would definitely come back for beer or food, but perhaps on a less busy night when they have an appropriate staff:customer ratio.",

I didn't love that the water came out at room temperature with no ice, but our waitress brought us some when we asked.   I really liked the taste of the sliders, although I wish the patty had been bigger because the bun overpowered it. The taste of the garlic curly fries was good but the fries weren't really curly.

Same story for the food.   I got the pork sandwich with parmesan fries AND I WOULD DO IT AGAIN! The sandwich was one of the best pulled pork sandwiches I've had not from a barbecue place and there was a great portion of the parm fries as well.

The avocado fries and steak tenderloin were the table favorites. We shared the Burger Royale with cheese  (pulp fiction reference) and damn it was good. TJ and how brother were our servers and they were phenomenal. The owner introduced himself to use and checked on us a few times as well. Love this place. Added to one of my favorites. Huge selection of local beers on deaf as well as a ton of options in cans and bottles. They also had mule specials for $5. A must go to   Thank you Pint Central!",

    "text": "It's Sunday June 2, 2019 in Charlotte. The Charlotte Checkers of the American Hockey League (one rung below the NHL) are set to play game two of the Calder Cup finals at 6:00 p.m. Most of the closest dining establishments to Bojangles Coliseum are in Plaza Midwood which is a five-minute drive, but we had been to a few of them repeatedly. We pulled out the GoPlaySave coupon book and saw a coupon for Pint Central. The menu looked good so that was our decision.  Walking in at 3:30 on Sunday was mostly a good thing. At this off-peak time, there were only two people at the bar and none at any of the tables. The bartender, in a friendly manner, directed us to have a seat wherever we'd like, which we did. I was apprehensive about this service because I went to use the restroom, came back, and no one had come by our table. However, when she went to the restroom, a very friendly server came by. We received our drinks quickly, then ordered our food. The lunch menu is somewhat limited with mostly sandwiches, but they were so good.   I ordered the Turkey Sandwich (no clever name needed here) without bacon: \"A mound of grilled turkey topped with lettuce, tomato, bacon, avocado and chipotle aioli. $9.\" This also included a choice of side and I opted for sweet potato fries. Although these were more than likely not made in-house, they were still good, especially with the sea salt to contrast the sweetness. The sandwich was just delicious - it was definitely a \"mound\" of turkey, the bread was fresh, and chipotle aioli provided just enough of a kick to amp up the flavor.   She ordered a beet sandwich which also looked delicious and said it was. Her side was grilled veggies which were cauliflower, zucchini, onions, peppers, and probably something else I'm forgetting. Anyway, those were good too.  This is what I really love about the GPS coupon books. They sell the books as fundraisers but it can also help local businesses. If not for the coupon, we may have just went to on of our regular spots. However, we will go back now and have no qualms about paying full price if the food and service are as good as what we experienced this day. Oh, and in case you're wondering, the Checkers won 5-3 so this may be a good luck spot.",

The service has always been friendly and attentive--even when we throw in dietary restrictions, they've always been very accommodating.   The atmosphere is laid back with plenty of seating. It's an open layout with a large bar along one side of the room.   While we tried multiple items, my favorite was the Mushroom Sandwich. In general this menu offers multiple vegetarian options--but this sandwich was awesome. Paired with the yucca fries it was exactly what I was looking for.",

Truth be told, it's been a while since my last visit so I can't give as detailed of a review as I usually do but here goes:  The service is always friendly. The food is good and actually really seasoned (which I like). I have had their garlic shrimp, empanadas, tacos, churrasco and other items and all of them were really good. They do offer a wide variety of beers as well, as the name implies. They have an outdoor section which could potentially be pet friendly and they have they are located in a small-ish shopping center with dedicated parking. That being said, it can get a little crazy during busier hours between them, the salon next door and the other businesses but there is some street parking available too.    Inside, they have some tables, 1/2 booths and a counter/bar.   One of the occasions when I was there, the service, though friendly, was really slow and one of our items was forgotten so we had to ask for it again. We also had to wait for our glasses to be refilled. Other than that; I have enjoyed my visits there and would recommend it.",

    "text": "(10/20/18) My wife brought me to Pint Central based on a recommendation from one of her coworkers. She's a closet foodie but she's been spot on with her shares. So Pint Central is about 19 miles from our house. Its a tiny restaurant in a small strip shopping center next to Salon. When you arrive you seat yourself. We chose a table along the far wall with a good view of the bar.  Our server was Carlos. He was very knowledgable about the menu. We ordered Avocado Fries, Avocado Egg rolls and Beef with chimichurri sauce to start. The Avocado Fries were nicely breaded and melt in your mouth creamy inside.  The Avocado egg rolls were a more sophisticated version of the egg rolls that are served at Chilis. They had a nice sauce that went well with the fries as well.  The beef with chimichurri sauce was amazing! Such an amazing amount of flavor in a perfectly cooked bite size piece of meat. This set the tone for the rest of the meal. My wife ordered teriyaki wings and capers for her entree. I had the Milanese with roasted veggies. She enjoyed her dishes. Mine came out on a platter. I was able to eat half the meal there and ate the rest for lunch this afternoon. I'm looking forward to our next visit.",

I came here on a Monday night and there was a pretty good cross for it being a weekday.  The interior is decorated nicely and featured artwork from local artists for sale. It gave the place a nice vibe that I liked. The servers were friendly and were attentive.   For beer I got a pale ale that was on draft. It was crisp and had a slight fruity flavor. For food I got the Korean burger with parm fries. The burger was juicy and had a nice spice thanks to the sauce. The burger was topped with pork belly which was a tasty addition. The fries were crispy and had just enough cheese.   Overall this was a great place to grab a drink and dinner!",

They have recently changed the menu and my favorite tapa, the mushroom and goat cheese bruscetta, was sadly removed. I would love if the new management would bring that back! Last night I ordered the Yuca fries...would not order again...underwhwelming. I did like the chipotle aioli sauce, however. The service here can fluctuate...I've had great servers here and then inattentive and slightly rude servers. Sometimes, it can be loud inside if there is a DJ. Not so sure this is the best place for a DJ-- it's a bit too small in my opinion for one. My first time at Pint was amazing and I loved everything. I think each time I go back, there is something different or changed about the food or menu so it's not always my first choice to bring friends anymore.

    "text": "After a very long day at work myself and my coworkers used Yelp to pick a good place to eat.  Pint Central was the choice based off the reviews we read and the opportunity to take advantage of the check in deal, where you get a free appetizer with the purchase of a entree.  Once we arrived at the establishment we were quickly seated and made mention to our server that we had the check in voucher to redeem.  She looked puzzled and had no clue what we were talking about.    Our server then took our orders. We made mention to her again about the check in voucher. Our drinks came and we still hadn't heard what the managers answer was.  As our meals were being brought out that's when we were informed that the manager would only honor 1 appetizer, which was disappointing.  So we ordered the garlic shrimp and asked if they could speed the order up so we could eat it with our entrees.     I have to say that the meals were nothing much to write home about, sub par at best.  Four of us ordered the churrasco and one ordered the meatball sandwich.  Maybe we miss read the menu but they brought out a over cooked, paper thin sliced prime rib instead of a fat juicy piece of Churrasco.  None of the steaks were cooked to order and the parm fries were basically tasteless.  The meatball sub was basically bread with 2 meatballs cut in half, with cheese draped over it to make a sandwich.  Oh yeah I didn't forget about the appetizer it's just that it still hadn't gotten to the table yet as we finished our meals.    In the End the Garlic Shrimp appetizer was finally brought out to our table as we were paying our bill.  Overall the slow service, poorly cooked steak and management not honoring the voucher for all left us very frustrated and disappointed.  The Garlic shrimp was basically frozen shrimp baked in a Alfredo sauce which tasted very fishy and no garlic taste.  Oh and while using the bathroom the bartender used the stall and returned to the bar without washing his hands. Not Cool.",

I mean - I am at the bar so I'm definitely not going to sit here without drinking, but no need to be pushy about whether or not I had decided. The place wasn't busy I'll take my time if I so please... He went down some talk about whiskey, which I won't bore you with...  Everything we decided to order off the tapas menu was fantastic!

We sat at the bar in the side patio (so, you're outside it facing inside with direct access to the bar tender for all your craft beer needs) and enjoyed a few pints and bites.   Their beer selection was great. We were there during Sugar Creek's tap take over, so there were multiple selections from them. But, they also had other good selections from the likes of Lost Coast, Birdsong, Legion, Du Claw, etc. etc.   We stuck with tapas for food and had the brussels sprouts, yucca fries, and beef with chimichurri. Everything was pretty tasty but slightly overpriced. The yucca fries in particular were $7. That's $1 per piece of yucca. Ouch!",

There seemed to be two bartenders and two servers. The server, a male whom I do not know his name, was friendly and gave us great suggestions based on our questions. The trivia questions was fairly decent, and made us think a little, but the last trivia... oh my gosh, it was the hardest think EVER. We did not answer one correctly (fully).  Overall, we did order the parm fries - and they were AMAZING! They were a bit crisp, but yet chewy. And we got the chipotle aioli - a  MUST! I will definitely be back, and hopefully the questions aren't AS hard.",

The provoleta came out as one giant cold block. You are supposed to be able to dip crostinis into it. The bread pudding was nine dollars for a block that was ice cold in the middle. The caramel on top was pretty delicious though - I'll give them that.",

This is an awesome spot to chill in the fall when the weather is nice out.  The only gripe I have about this place is the customer service.  It was not that packed being a Wednesday but one of the bartenders (i'm assuming that he was a bartender because he was behind the bar) was talking to his friends the entire time.  I was hoping this guy was going to see that the I had not been attended to for quite some time by the original bartender that served me and would ask if I needed another beer or would check on me but it never happened.  I was going to try another beer but since it took so long to get served I just cashed out.",

Good for me, because I don't like crowds.  The interior was open and decorated in a minimalist style.  We told the hostess, \"2\" when she asked us how many.  She responded, \"are you sure?\" which I found a bit odd.  I don't think that she  meant to say that. We ordered the mozzarella bites, avocado fries, calamari and Brussels sprouts.  The first three were typical fried bar food, but those Brussels sprouts were something special.  They were chargrilled and tossed with pesto.  How brave of them to put Brussels sprouts on their menu.  And how delicious they were!  My next favorite were the mozzarella bites.  We could have used a few more of them.  The avocado fries needed more flavor, and the calamari was a bit on the rubbery side. I would like to try more items from their menu, especially the beet panini.  And, I am definitely going back for more Brussels sprouts!",

They also feature a great selection of wine and liquor. They make some dang tasty mixed drinks. Their Manhattans are among the best in Charlotte.  The food is very high quality for a pub. A decent menu no matter your dietary preference. Spicy eggplant dip might seem odd at first, but it is some really tasty stuff. Even though it may come off as a pub, it can also be a great place for dinner with friends/family.  There is plenty of seating, both at the bar, inside booth and tables, and outside. They have a front and a back patio. Both are nice. In the front you can see Central Ave. and the cars and people go back. The back patio is fenced in, so you get some more privacy there.  Last I'll mention that the staff and management are very nice people and you can tell they care about their work. I definitely recommend trying this place out.",

Inside, Pint Central is actually bigger than it appears from the street and as a great plus, they have an enclosed patio so you can enjoy your beverage outside. What sets Pint apart is their food. We enjoyed two tapas plates - the Brussels sprouts were great and the avocado egg rolls were very good as well. NOT your normal bar food for sure.

I ordered a delicious appetizer, the Avocado Eggrolls, that were absolutely fab & was so full from them that I didn't need to order an entree.   With a name like \"Pint Central\" I was expecting a pretty extensive local beer selection; I was sad that their list of local brews was pretty limited and hope they consider expanding the list in the not-too-distant future.   Service was great, our server was really friendly and very attentive. My only complaint, aside from the limited local selections is the noise... the place was not crowded when I was in there, but because of the small size and the concrete floors, it was so loud I could barely have a conversation wth my friend. I'm not an acoustics expert, but there have to be some relatively inexpensive measures they can take to muffle the noise a bit so that people can comfortably carry on a conversation.   All in all, great place... they're still pretty new, so I hope they get the few kinks  worked out. I will definitely be back and am excited to try more of their phenomenal food!",

We had to parka few blocks down.    The dining area is medium size - there is a long bar, high tops and low seating around the sides.  We sat at a high top and ordered fantastic local beer.    I also had the pork belly - WOW.  It was tender and well seasoned.  I love small plates because it is always the right amount of food.  We also had the calamari and the brussel sprouts.  The sprouts were done in a pesto sauce which I haven't had together before.  VERY GOOD and a large serving so you actually don't mind sharing this one.  The calamari was light and very large pieces which is different.  Everything was very good and service was great.    Love this new local spot!!",

    "text": "Was not incredibly impressed with this place. But there were a couple of highlights including the beef tidbits (very well-cooked and seasoned) and the mini burgers which was surprising. I think what drove the mini burgers home was whatever onion-type sauce they are topped with.  Otherwise, based on the other items we ordered (don't get the wings), to me it simply seemed this place was trying a little too hard to be \"trendy\" and \"hip\" both with their menu and atmosphere. The beer selection wasn't terrible at all but for a place with \"pint\" in the name, I was expecting a bit more.  Atmosphere-wise, I think I was again turned off by the place trying way too hard to be trendy and modern. For some reason it just didn't fit what I was expecting.  I'm not sure I'll try this place again since I feel we got most of what was good on the menu with limited satisfaction. Certainly the mini burgers might be worth a trip however. We'll see.",

Beer selection is on point - bartender recommended the weyerbacher imperial stout which was well balanced. I will add this one to my favorites.   Parking situation is kind of a nightmare. I don't think pint central has more than ten spots to its name, which leaves everyone else to scramble to find street parking or park in the gravel lot across the street next to thirsty beaver. This necessitates a dash across busy central avenue after, which I was not a fan of.   Food situation was ok. I was honestly expecting better based on what I had heard, but it was solid given most come here for a drink with food as an afterthought. Mozzarella bites were tasty but over breaded in my opinion. Red peppers were a nice touch though. I had the churrasco which turned out to be very thin slices (almost gyro style) pieces of meat accompanied by fries. The meat had plenty of flavor but I was underwhelmed by the portion size, and it seemed as though the same meat was used in the steak sandwich my friend ordered at a portion of the price.   Overall I had a good time, but given parking and food, I won't be adding this one to my regular rotation.",

My major gripes were these: I had a food allergy, and ordered something specifically marketed as being allergen free, was brought the wrong food and therefore something with allergens in it, and was charged for things that were offered to me seemingly at no cost.  I got tacos (Note: Tofu taco is NOT gluten free; I reached out to restaurant to see if the beef taco was because I got sick after eating there and suspect it isn't, but they did not ever contact me back) because the waitress told me it was what they were known for.  Not worth it.  2 stars because my margarita was cheap ($5 special on Mondays) and tasty, although again, not life altering.",

We went in today for a beer because their patio is adorable and great and it was a super great patio day. While the patio is great, table service on the patio was unfortunately non existent, so we went to the bar outside (also a great idea and convenient) but the bartenders didn't even check on the outside bar. So we then went inside to the bar, and it took three movements down the bar for someone to notice us. Finally, when they did notice us (yay!) it took several more minutes (it felt like eons but really, what doesn't when you're waiting to drink your beer in the sunshine) for them to bring the beers and run my card. I know they're new and have some kinks to work out, and it really pains me to complain about service, but it was disappointing (at least everyone was nice!).  We also were there for one of their soft openings, and while everyone was friendly then too, service was slow that night as well (which is understandable kinks and all and it was really busy). We tasted some of the food and it was ok, but nothing out of this world. The music was also super loud (god I feel like a grandmother for saying that) and the atmosphere I guess just wasn't for me.  The beer selection is good (but on par and similar to many other places in the area that I love...hello Kickstand!!!) and the patio is nice so I'll probably give them another chance, but might wait a few weeks for those kinks.",

During the day though it has been a different story.  On a couple occasions during the day our lunch has taken a ridiculously long time.  Both times there was barely anyone in there.

We showed up when the food was ready and after we received confirmation of payment and the food being placed. We waited about 15 minutes for them to find my order but They didn't have anything. We had to reorder everything again and wait a good 45 minutes to get it. The short, tan waitress with a buzzcut dealing with our order was in a terrible mood and didn't help at all. We then received a receipt to pay yet I already payed on THEIR website. It was absolutely insane. I was asked to pay double due to them not knowing how to work their website and waiting for about an hour and a half after ordering online. It was completely disorganized and the service to help solve the problem was useless. It was a waste of time and now I'm eating dinner at 8:45 PM in my home, which is insane. I'm never going back there. I'd rather give my $$ to other local businesses who treat their customers better.",

It was a beautiful bar and patio set up, which they've improved on even more since then. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable. Our waiter gave us detailed info on mixed drinks and tapas, without even looking at the menu (which changes often) or notes. There's front and rear patios to choose from and the rear one is huge for that area. Bathroom was clean, too!  We've been back a dozen times (and live 45min away, btw) and have NEVER had an issue that wasn't addressed immediately **when brought to their attention.

    "text": "The food came a bit short of Four Stars.  I rounded down to 3 because of all the beer induced 5 star reviews already posted and I think this place deserved a foodie's review.   We had lunch outside in the patio on the first day of spring, the weather was perfect, service was very good, I even ordered a draft : the stage was all set for a pleasant time, which it was.   We ordered 4 small plates, they came out in the right amount of time, neither too quick nor too long a wait. Unfortunately everything was brought at once -as is always the case in Charlotte. No biggie.   Korey's Eggplant dip ($6) was good, we enjoyed it - then again I always order the eggplant dips at the Greek, Lebanese, Turk etc, there are a zillion recipes. The dip is served with grilled bread smothered with melted butter. IMO it would be better if the melted butter was served on the side.  3.5 stars for the dip   Provoleta ($6) grilled provolone served in a cast iron skillet and (very lightly sprinkled) with herbs. I love that dish and served correctly like this was there's no way to ruin it. I've had it this many times before, sometimes seasoned more boldly but that's not a must. The grilled bread which came with it was again smothered with melted butter, not necessary for melted cheese.  4 stars    Choripan ($7) I ordered it because we were told the chorizo is made in house. The (very mild) spicy chorizo sandwich kicked butt, it got my taste buds dancing. It comes with a mound of skinny freshly cut fries. They were out of sweet potato fries and substituted with garlic parmesan. Tasty! For only $7 bucks it makes for a great lunch by itself, the caveat being don't order the garlic-parm it if you have a date, not even if that date will be 8 hrs later for dinner!   Grumblings aside: 4 stars  Argentine empanadas ($7 for 3 small ones)  prepared by the owner's mom - an Argie and Uruguayan tradition - now that was a tough dish to rate, here is why.  We ordered one of each : ground beef (spicy with olives), chicken and a veggie. Each of the stuffing was delicious. Now I've eaten all sorts of great empanadas(mushrooms, onions, all kinds) but when it comes to the basic 3 meat, chicken or veg, it doesn't get better than these stuffings - could have been a contender.   Unfortunately these small empanadas were half empty (more, gimme more!) and worse : overcooked and dripping with oil from the fryer. I did mention to the junior owner that at the very least they should pat them dry (like bacon) before they served them - not sure if that registered, the waitress got it though.  There's another issue too, Argies both bake empanadas (our favorite) or deep fry them. IMO the flaky dough used here would have been better suited for baking. When the short order cook gets his act together these could be a winner but for now .... 2.5 stars.  Pint Central is a comfortable hangout with an interesting menu and moderate prices, I'd definitely like to return and try more items from their menu",

We simply wanted to sit on a patio somewhere and try something new and I remembered from driving by so much that they did have outdoor seating in the front so we figured why not! Well little did I know that they actually have an extended patron around the right side of the building that opens up to an area with outdoor bar access and a number of picnic tables. It was such a relaxing atmosphere with the murals on the walls and hanging plants and a back gate access to walk your dogs through. The food was great too we both got the tacos that had a more authentic taste to them especially for bar food with seasoned chicken cilantro and onions and salsa on the side that tasted homemade and the tortillas were pretty good too!

I had the egg rolls - can't recall the name of them but they're southwestern style and came with black beans, corn, cilantro drizzle (could be removed for vegan option). They were delicious! I also ordered the eggplant dip which had some kick to it (I like this) and came with grilled bread slices for dipping.   My boyfriend had the shrimp/sausage skewers. He said they were fantastic.   Their selection of beers is crazy, local and hard to find. My favorite beer - Unibroue La Fin Du Monde was on tap, which I appreciated as it is pretty hard to find outside of bottles. Bartenders were attentive and I can tell the place will become a favorite even more as the weather warms up. Great outside patio that is currently being explanded around to the front.",

I'm so glad we did because I fell in love with the atmosphere and pleasant service. It was the owners birthday the night we went and it was kind of nice to have him come over and ask how everything was.  He stayed and talked for about 20 minutes and even made recommendations for next time we visit. The highlights: we ordered several tapas and I'm glad we did because we got a variety of flavors ranging from fried avocados, chimichurri, calamari, pesto brussel sprouts, empanadas, and the eggplant dip! Everything was great and I was impressed on fast the food arrived. By the time our drinks hit the table the food was up! 5 stars in my book.  I can't forgot to mention the local beer selection both on tap n bottle. Plus it's pet friendly on the patio.  Great atmosphere and sure to be another midwood favorite!",

    "text": "I'm a fan.  I like any addition to the tap room scene for Charlotte and it looks like this place has their finger on the pulse of good beer which is ultimately important.  Add to this the great food items and proper portions and you've got a solid combination.  Service was really great and enthusiastic.  The space is somewhat raw with concrete exposed, etc. but it's accented with some very unique wood tables and the bar is also aesthetically pleasing.  Couple drawbacks is the parking is a bit difficult and you'll likely have to park around the corner on the street.  Also, the acoustics of the place are tough.  With enough people in there you'll find yourself having to talk rather loudly to communicate.",

My favorite is the beet burger, beet, arugula, goat cheese, crispy bun, PERFECT. Prices are good, service has always been excellent. Highly recommend this place for lunch.",
