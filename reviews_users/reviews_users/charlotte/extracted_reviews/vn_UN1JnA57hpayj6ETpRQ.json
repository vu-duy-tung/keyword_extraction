    "text": "Beware the syrup! Stopped in here because I had a hankering for some french toast early one sunday morning. The service was fast, sometimes too fast. (My waitress asked me if I was ready to order about 15 seconds after I was seated and brought the bill with my feel which made me feel rushed.) For some bizarre reason they have implemented a system where the chef calls out over the loudspeaker to let the waitresses know when the food is ready which does not make for a pleasant environment to enjoy breakfast. At all. So finally my french toast arrives and I prepare to dig in. I read the top of the syrup closest to me which says \"old fashioned\" oh yea that's how I like it. I notice that this syrup has a purple tint to it. Definitely not old fashioned. I called the waitress over to let her know that I don't eat that kind of syrup and now my french toast is ruined bug assured her I at least tried to do the right thing by reading the top where it said old fashioned. She said \"oh they all usually say the same thing.\" um...what is the point of that? She brought me out some new french toast likety split and I tested out the syrup before I went in for the big pour this time. Overall food was good, this guy yelling in my ear the duration of my breakfast was not.",

    "text": "I've been to this IHOP many many times with pretty good service. The most recent visit (tonight) literally left a bad taste in my mouth.  It started with a less than attentive waitress, progressed to a dirty teaspoon, and ended with batter-filled undercooked pancakes (that arrived about 10 minutes after the other part of my meal).  I asked for a manager. The woman who came over asked the problem, I told her and asked her to comp the pancakes. (They were part of the double blueberry pancake combo.)  She apologized several times then left the table.  When our waitress brought the bill, she said the manager had taken $5 off the bill.   We were comped our drinks (one cup of hot tea and the all-you-can-drink soda). I wasn't aware those two drinks were $5, but okay...  Kudos to the seasoned waitress, Iris, who tried her best to rectify our situation.  Actually I happen to be a French toast fan but c'mon IHOP! If you can't do pancakes, well, what CAN ya do?",

This is what it is, a breakfast place, not the Taj Mahal. I try to base my reviews on what a store or restaurant actually is , and not compare an IHOP to the Brown Derby.  The food is consist ant and is my mothers fave place to meet my wife and I for breakfast. I only wish they offered omelet without the added pancake batter, it does make for a fluffy omelets, but my wife has gluten issues, and this severely limits her menu choices.  Try to arrive no later than about 8:30 unless you like waiting on a table.  Also the last few visits the Wi-Fi was down for some reason",

This place jams on Sundays; it seems that if you are not here by 8:30 you are waiting outside with the crowds.   I would eat here more; but can't eat gluten and everything here comes with pancakes. Yes, I know it the IHOP, but is it too much to ask for more than one option with out the flapjacks? They even add batter to the omelets. Pity too; there are more options for me at Denny's,  but the food here is better.",

We were told about a 15 min wait. It took 30.  Once we were seated, we were greeted by our waitress quickly. She was very nice, and definitely knew what she was doing. The positive for this visit stops there.  We both had quick 2 egg, with bacon, hash browns, and toast. Also a carafe of OJ. The OJ was great! Both our eggs came out way undercooked. The bacon was way, way, overcooked. \"Hashbrowns\" were raw. Our toast had some sort of nasty spray oil/butter on it that just ruined plain white toast. (didn't know you could do that)  Then while waiting to pay with our credit card on the table, we sat for almost 20 minutes before our waitress returned for the check. Again it was busy, she was double sat, no big deal. Except that the \"manager\" walked by our table 3 times and couldn't be bothered to pick up our check and run it. He instead was sitting with what looked like some old buddies BS'ing while everyone else ran around like chickens with their heads cut off.  No thanks, I won't be back.",

    "text": "I have been going to this particular IHOP location for years now, and one thing I have learned, is to get there early on the weekends if you want to avoid a wait.  So that is exactly what my gf and I did today, Sunday 12/11/11.  We arrived around 9:30am, we able to find parking without difficulty, and did not have to wait at all for a table!  After going through the standard preliminaries, being seated, placing drink orders, ordering our meals, etc, my gf and I were relieved when our food finally arrived due to our mutual hunger.  I ordered  the 3 egg breakfast, which included, four pieces of bacon, and three pancakes (I ordered the blueberry pancakes).  In addition, I ordered a side of hash browns, just to be certain that my hunger pain would be satisfied.  FOOD:   My gf and I ordered our eggs scrambled with cheese and they arrived to our mutual liking -hot and with plenty of cheese (see pics).  I thought my bacon was a bit under-cooked however.  2 of the pieces were cooked perfectly and two were definitely semi-raw.  I left one of my slices because I did not feel safe eating it.  The hash browns were standard.  They were good, but def not great, and in need of some salt and pepper.  The best part of our breakfast was the pancakes.  I ordered the blueberry pancakes, which were  \"REAL and SPECTACULAR!\" (see pics)  They were full of soft, juicy blueberries and the warm maple syrup set everything right off!  SERVICE: Our service was great.  Our server was polite, efficient and to the point.  She refiled our waters twice and all of our food arrived exactly as we had ordered it. We were able to get in and out within 40-50min.  I will say that when we left around 10:30, there was that line of people waiting in the door and standing outside in the cold waiting to be seated!  If you are thinking of going to this IHOP location, I recommend getting the bacon cooked well, as well as arriving early and to try one of their flavored pancakes.  I mean this place isn't called the International House of Pancakes for NOTHING!",

I got the stuffed French toast with strawberries, hash browns, turkey sausage and cheese grits in stead of eggs. I get there and they gave me the donut French toast. I asked the lady that placed my order \"what is this\" and she proceeds with \"well we don't have that stuffed French toast anymore so I assumed u wanted the donut one\". Like WTF you don't assume what I want to eat. And the only reason I even started eating at IHOP again was bc they brought the stuffed French toast back. So her manager comes out and I guess he forgot to tell the staff that they are now serving the stuffed French toast again. He apologizes and takes the donut French toast back and 10mins later brings me a stuffed French toast. At this point I should have checked my order before leaving bc I get home and realize that they never gave me my cheese grits! Completely horrible!!! I'm so pissed!",

It's loaded with ham, bacon, sausage and pot roast! It comes with salsa on the side which adds a very nice flavor!   My food came out hot, and prepared just the way I ordered, these omelets are pretty big so be prepared to take half of it home!   The pancakes were fluffy and hot...I always ask for the hot syrup to go with them!   Just a note....Parking is horrible...the lot is always full! Other than that it was a good meal at a good price, so you will see me again IHOP!!!",

Finally got to the table, we all ordered coffee/orange juice. Coffee wasn't that good, I only had a few sips from mine. I ordered the country omelet which had ham, cheese and hash-browns inside. It tasted pretty good, hot sauce made it taste better. I do wish I would have asked for some salsa to go with it to give it a little more flavor. My friend ordered an omelet and she had asked for no mushrooms and when hers came out...it had a lot of mushrooms inside. She decided to just pick them out instead of making a big deal about it. She didn't even finish half of it because she said it was too bland.",

    "text": "IHOP is the place for my unusual loaded baked potato soup fix of the day. It is my favorite item on their menu. But that aside it's not a particularly unique experience to go here. Yeah it's the International House of Pancakes but I have to say it's a name we spent lots more time pondering over hot Lipton's tea while waiting for our food to come out. Like, why is it international? Because the food isn't exactly international fare and I'm not aware of them being popular in foreign countries. In fact the most international thing about this IHOP is the multicultural staff and the university area patrons.  Yeah, they have some standard menu items I like but I can get a steak omelet at at least 100 other unique joints just in this city. Breakfast food is breakfast pretty much anywhere you go. It's impossible to screw up eggs. And they don't. Just like delicious pancakes with different toppings. The one thing you can rely on is boring consistency with a chain like IHOP so boring that you almost want them to burn your bacon to a crisp so that you have to complain to get some excitement with your meal. When I'm depressed and want to indulge in the comforts of a warm bowl of pureed potato soup I know I can always find IHOP there for me.",

The parking is a disaster and I have almost been hit by a car while walking, hit by a car while parking, and hit by a car while just driving.  I really don't like how it forces all the traffic into a narrow U shaped parking area.  On the bright side while you are waiting or recovering from a near death experience you can peruse the used bookstore next to the IHOP.  This IHOP is about mid-range when it comes to how new and clean looking it is.  I have seen some fancy IHOP locations and some ones that look like they haven't been renovated since the 1970s.  This one looks to be about the middle of the pack.",

Bathroom was dirty, but the floor in the main dining room was disgusting. I had to walk by the kitchen to get to my seat, and the floor was so black from dirt, and around our booth so gross.  My husband had already ordered a Coke.  So he said let's ask what the sanitation score is, the girl said, 98.  So I asked her why the place was so filthy, when there was only one other table seated, and 3 servers standing around. Of course, she said, I'm sorry about that.   It was such a fiasco, it was a rainy night and no one was there, the other table got their food and I Overheard them complaining about how long it took. It was our own stupidity that we stayed, they have a new cook and didn't know how to make anything!  They didn't even have mashed potatoes, they said the person that makes those had already went home. I ordered the chicken fried steak and ended up getting french fries with it. I was supposed to get a piece of Texas toast. It never came, when I asked about it, she went back and checked. The cook came out and said I don't know how to make that! It's a piece of toast! As we are getting ready to leave they brought me one lonely little piece of toast. It was the kind that is pre-buttered...   One of my Husband's close friends thanks IHOP is the best restaurant in the world! But said this is the worst one in town. I thought because it was newer and on my way home we'd give it a try.    Big mistake!!! Never again",

    "text": "I came on a weekday AM, not busy, about 10 servers standing around wiping down chairs.  The server we had seemed to have all the tables and no help.  The food was not so great, very greasy with a weird taste.  The service wasn't so good, not because the server was bad, but because she had no help, even though they were fully staffed.  Just not a place I would recommend, I'd rather go to McDonald's down the street honestly.",

    "text": "This IHOP's unprofessionalism from the \"manager\" Bobby Williams has caused all IHOPS as a whole to lose my business, regardless if it's a corporate or franchise. I felt he was unprepared, and it is MY RIGHT to voice my displeasure as I see fit as long as it's not derogatory or violent, so I told him as I walked out after he clearly showed he did not value my business, that he and his IHOP was unprepared and should have been better prepared. He immediately took offense, got smart with me, and told me to \"get over it, places run out of stuff\", I have managerial experience through several channels of retail and commission sales, that is not how you speak to a customer whether you're an employee or manager of a business!!! His job as manager, when someone says something you don't like or agree with, it's your duty to be professional about it by either by saying something along the lines of I'm sorry sir/miss you feel that way or just by not saying anything and letting it roll off your shoulders. Mind you I was walking out the door, so that triggered me, I came back in after he called me out, we argued about his lack of being prepared as he continued to use his excuse of running out of stuff. At this point I was highly irate, and this was where I got uncivil, prior to this I never shouted or screamed at him or his staff/I did not use derogatory words or profanity/I did not threaten him or his staff with violent physical threats, all I did up to this point of arguing was displaying my dissatisfaction of how things were ran through an unprepared manager through a tone of voice that was a bit angry(not raging mad) and grumpy/dissatisfied, and that was my right to do so. Like I said at this point of arguing, I lost my composure, due to his lack of PROFESSIONALISM and wanting to argue with me as a \"manager\", I snapped and told him twice to F him, I proceeded to walk out in rage, he decided he wanted to be smart some more and purposely said in a volume loud enough so I could hear as I was walking out the doors yet again \"yea you're all talk, that's why you walk\". Again that is not how a True manager of a workplace acts. We argued yet again, I told that a True manager doesn't act the way he acted, that a manager doesn't act like he's from the hood. Once again I go to walk out, as I am doing so he then retaliates with a cocky thuggish attitude, \"yea I am hood\". That causes me to finally go into overdrive with my irateness and anger, I got extremely loud to where customers noticed, I told him \"see that's what I'm talking about, a True manager does not act that way and says stuff like that to customers\", he scoffs some more and talks more trash talk to me. So I finally tell him in rage that I wanted his name because I was going to immediately call IHOP corporate and report him to them and have him fired for speaking to me the way he did as that is not the way to talk to a customer ever, his response was a cocky one he goes \"fine give em my name, it's the name on my shirt\" he then immediately points to his name on his shirt with both of his index fingers with force as he stares me down with anger. I have a high respect for the word and position of MANAGER through my experiences as one and my teachings from mentors in my experiences, I highly felt he disrespected that role and title tremendously, so I made sure to let him know that he was from my perspective was undeserving of that position, that he brought both disgrace and shame to the managerial role, and that he was no manager whatsoever by the standards of what it is to be a manager. I then contacted corporate immediately in my car outside in the parking lot, they told me they would contact the owner of the franchise about the matter and have someone from that franchise to contact me by Monday to resolve the issue of the unprofessional manager. No one ever did contact me, so I called corporate Tuesday, gave them my case number, the girl on the phone from corporate informed me that the owner told corporate that they refuse to contact me in an effort to resolve the issue with me stating to them I was \"combative\", though it was the \"manager\" who retaliated first when I simply told him what I thought about his lack of preparation, which his FIRST retaliation triggered the start of a long drawn out war of words, which his further retaliations would just keep adding fuel to the fire as he knew I'd wouldn't simply let them go unchecked. Obviously the owner doesn't care about me, my business, my money, or resolving the issue that is still present. This IHOP is a bad reflection on IHOP as a whole, as a COMPANY, and as a BRAND!!!",

    "text": "I just got finished eating here and it was the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. We got there and waited 45 minutes for our food the only reason that makes sense about the wait is they did have a big party which is completely understandable. After waiting 45 minutes they told my grandma they ran out of her food. They had not told us this until after we waited 45 minutes. Me and my sister and my dad ate and my grandma and grandpa walked away. We did not get any refills at all the whole time and had to ask for silverware about four times. Our waiter provided terrible service. The kids meals where supposed to be free but they charged us for it because there wasn't enough adults there. There was one single girl in there that was extremely nice so if you go there for whatever reason ask for her I don't know her name but she is African American with long eyelashes (they may be fake or extensions) and she has black hair and a skinny form. She was the only person that attempted to make the situation less crazy.",

I asked why and the manager said that someone came in there with a stolen cerdit card and got a $1,000 gift card. He shift manager called the GM and the GM said I could only get a gift card if they could take a copy of my ID and Credit card. Why is that? That's to much person information. I HAD MY ID!! THATS NOT MY FAULT THE EMPLOYEE LET SOMEONE BUY A $1, 000 GIFT CARD WITH A CREDIT CARD WITHOUT CHECKING THE ID!!! And for the GM, who know all about credit card fraud asking me for a copy of my card and ID in order to buy a gift card is unacceptable!!!!! The GM name is Bobby Williams WHAT STORE OR RESTAURANT DOES THAT!! BTW I ONLY WANTED A DANG ON $20 gift card! I could even see if I was trying to get the gift card and NO ID ... BUT I HAD MY ID",

    "text": "Undercooked food, wrong orders, and now liars all within 2 visits? Can't be...  Yes it can. IHOP off of WT Harris was able to accomplish that:  My friend and I went into IHOP one day after working out and ordered the egg white omelet with shelled eggs and add steak. First order they did not use shelled eggs and the steak was undercooked. 2nd order, I'm thinking maybe they got this one right; wrong! They used shelled eggs but forgot to add steak. (How did you forget the steak?) Then our fruit was spoiled. I spoke with the manager, they finally got the orders right. At this point, my lady friend was so exasperated that she did not want the food. They didn't charge us for her food of course due to her barely touching it. The manager was very nice and I'm more of an easy going person I'd like to think, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. He told me hey, I'm sorry that you had such a bad experience. I told him how great the service was (New girl who hasn't been acclimated to the typical soulless dry service that we've experienced but hey it's not like we're at Ruth Cris so I get it, although I have been to some exceptionally well customer service oriented IHOPS) In the attempt to gain in the middle of a negative situation, the manager said hey, I'll give you $5 off your next meal if you take the survey. Just tell them our agreement. I said okay, left the waitress a tip which consists of her normal %20 and added the additional $10 for my lady friends meal that she did not eat. It wasn't her fault the kitchen guys couldn't get it right. So today I go back to IHOP and order to go. I explain to the lady what happened and the managers promise and this manager would not honor it at all. I said ma'am how would I have known about your survey if you all didn't direct me to take it in exchange for a $5 credit. I said ma'am it's $5. I wouldn't have cared if I hadn't already held up my part of the bargain. She repeated with persistence I'm sorry over and over again as if she didn't hear one concern that departed my lips. It was the principal of having a bad experience only to be lied to, after giving them a good review based on a deceitful promise. I now question the integrity of this branch even more.",
