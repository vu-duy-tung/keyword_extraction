    "text": "Thanks to the fact that the manager and the server himself apologized profusely at the end of our lunch and comped the entire lunch, I'm giving McCormick and Schmick's 3 stars and I would be willing to try them again.   We even left a 20 dollar tip on a meal that would have cost ust about 50 bucks.  Backtracking a little bit...  My wife and I met for lunch and we decided to try McCormick's.   I ordered the Seafood Macaroni & Cheese, served with scallops and shrimps.   My wife went with a couple of appetizers:  crab cakes as well as coconut shrimp.   For drinks, I opted for the Sweet Tea and my wife got an Arnold Palmer.  5 minutes went by and our server brought us our drinks and some bread.  Another 5 minutes went by and I got my side salad, which was interestingly served in a wonton wrapper shell.   Hmmmm....  Next came over 25 minutes of waiting during which we saw several tables go through 2 courses while we didn't get any more food.   My wife, frustrated, finally went to talk to the manager and our food appeared an instant later.  The pasta was good but, errr...  now it could be something about East coast versus West coast, and I happily posted a picture of the seafood Macaroni & Cheese I was served, but... Well, in the San Francisco Bay Area, we'd call that seafood fettucini with cream sauce.   Those were most certainly not Macaroni and, as far as I can tell, there was absolutely no cheese.   Well, there might have been a little bit of parmesan in the sauce, I'll concede that much.    Still, this sure as hell wasn't Mac & Cheese.  It was a tasty dish, and there was a generous portion of properly cooked scallops and shrimp.   Still, I'd wanted Mac & Cheese and I felt let down.  The manager came by our table and apologized for the delay and said our meal was comped.   All in all, service was impeccable (when they didn't forget about us) but I still cannot give them more than 3 stars since I feel like my dish was big time False advertising.",

They consistently have great fresh seafood. On this visit we had the Wahoo and Ahi Tuna, both were exceptionally good!  We also had the Rhappanock Sting Ray oysters which are better than average.  The Coppola Merlot is a good choice.  The stained glass in this restaurant is art gallery worthy. In the bar area you will see large colorful stained glass ceiling light fixtures themed after various ACC teams as well as the Charlotte 49ers.  Don't miss the NC State flag about the hostess stand, a truly exceptional piece of art.",

I hate leaving a restaurant feeling like I flushed money down the drain but that is exactly what happened today.   Today the service is horrendously slow and the food disgusting. The employees are working hard doing nothing. Hiding in the back ignoring the customers sitting there waiting and waiting... The food isn't fresh or cooked to order. It's all heated in a microwave, rubbery, cold crap. We had one of the worst dining experiences ever. Seems like  employees are purposely sabotaging this place.   We will never go back. We will wait for the next restaurant as I'm sure this place will be gone soon.",

My husband and I had been craving some good seafood in our effort to eat healthy, so we decided to splurge and head to M&S on our lunch breaks from our uptown jobs.  I ordered the cedar roasted salmon, and he had one of the small plates (blackened mahi with risotto cake and a side salad).  First, our drinks were never refilled, and at a place like this, you just expect a certain level of service for the money you're paying.  Then, my husband's salad came with the meal although he asked for it first.  His entree just tasted off... like fish wasn't fresh, and risotto cake was like a brick.  It took forever to settle up with the bill, which was $58 before tip.  Ouch.  I'm fine paying for good food and service, but when things go awry, it's an awfully hard tab to pay.  I won't be coming back.",

They also fry up veggies with it as well. Even nicer is every year they serve all veterans and active military for a complimentary meal on the Sunday before Veterans Day. I recommend getting a reservation. As with last year I did not do this and it was very busy today. However they did have spots open at the bar where the service was spectacular. I ordered the pecan crusted chicken with a demi glaze, served with mash potatoes and broccoli. I ate every bite if that says anything. Also met another fellow single vet and made a new friend. Don't forget even if your meal is free remember to tip your server :). So all in all this place is on the top of my list.",

The restaurant itself is nicely furnished and the seats are comfy. For being a higher-end restaurant, the menu had more selection that I was initially anticipating. The service was great and my waiter knew the menu very well.   The only reason why I am giving McCormick & Schmick's 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the food. The presentation was amazing but the taste and portion size didn't blow me away. While the food here was very good, I don't think it commands the steep asking price.",

I spend most of my time in the bar area eating dinner and chatting it up with Austin before the bar.  Every now and then Kenny, the manager, comes by to say hello and we catch up on everything.  It just feels like... CHEERS to me.    So, I've been here so many times that I could write a novel about the whole menu and how everything tastes.  Just know, it is really difficult to find something that you don't love.  The fish tacos are so underrated it's a joke.  I could eat 5 billion of those bad boys.  Keeping with the underrated theme, the hummus blows your socks off.. YEAH!  Hummus!  As far as the seafood goes... I am from the North East.  We get some pretty kick a$$ seafood up there and McCormicks is the only place that I have found that can battle.  Fish is fresh (hard to find that around here), steaks are juicy and favorful, lobster bisque and ravioli are a TEN, and the mussels are spectacular.  Stop in and say hello.. I will probably be perched in the corner chatting it up.    Oh yeah... History Alert!!  There is a little piece of Queen City history right out front on the sidewalk.. Check it out.  Enjoy!  -Ian M.",

I did reservation online via open Table for 6:30 pm the next day and received a confirmation email. The next day at 5pm i get an email saying I was a no show for the reservation. I immediately called restaurant and somehow the system had a 4pm reservation even though my confirmation email showed 6:30pm. This was quickly resolved.  And I reminded them that this was a birthday celebration.  Got there seated and everything gradually went down hill. The restaurant is not kid friendly - just 1-2 items for kids on the menu, no kid size silverware. The service was so slow and it took forever for anything to come out despite the fact that the restaurant was 40-50% capacity. Drinks were not good, food came out cold. Food taste was mediocre. Waiter was not friendly nor apologetic about anything and only showed up every so often to check on the table.  My guest was not wished a happy birthday at anytime during the dinner nor anything else to feel a bit special. And I did tell the waiter it was a birthday celebration when we sat down.  For an upscale restaurant it was a very disappointing experience. I doubt I will be returning to this business.",

Although it was crowded we were able to grab a few seats at the bar. Service was great and the drinks and appetizers were on point. I enjoyed the apple martini, yum. As for food, we tried a variety of items. The calamari, tuna, cheeseburger and the shrimp cocktail. Although everything was great, the cheeseburger was by far the best. A half pound burger, cooked to perfection with fries for 5.99. How could you beat that deal?  Overall a great after work crowd, good service drinks and food.",

I had a not so great waiter as he was not very attentive and, seemed to be upset that I was seated at one of his tables and at one point heard him mumble under his breathe and, then said it's because of CIAA weekend and they had given him another table and it was so busy. It was not very crowded when I went as it was an hour before close. Well I ordered the Twin Atlantic Lobster tails with Lobster Mashed Potatoes and then the waiter says they ran out because of CIAA weekend, so I chose the saute mushroom spinach which happened to be good, but my lobster was cold as well as undercooked and I sent back to the kitchen. They were smaller then I imagined but for $35 I suppose that was average. It was bland with no real flavor to it. I ordered the strawberry mint palmer which came out after my food. I was by myself and I thought I would have a great dinner some but I was disappointed while visiting this location in Charlotte",

Basics: two orders of filet, lobster mashed potatoes, truffle macaroni, crab cakes, asparagus, and the octopus.  The larger filet was smaller than the petit to the point the waiter said he asked the chef prior to serving it and was assured it was correct.   Ok, never serve prime meat that even looks odd.  Lobster mashed potatoes had no lobster, none, and it was smeared creamed potato across the bottom of the cast iron it was served in. Maybe enough for one.  Asparagus was chewy. Macaroni was ok all in all. Drinks never came, and the sides with each filet were terrible.  I think it was late 10:30pm on a Friday, and we just got the leftovers, last of the meal prep.  I'm not exaggerating or trying to blast in anger. I paid my bill, tipped 10% and left. I just work very hard, not 1% living, and this was supposed to be a \"big night out\" and i swear we ended up at Shenanigans from Waiting.  Oh well, never will I get Schmicked again.",

Ordered appraisers and requested items for our oysters. The oysters sat while we waited for the condiments. Once the food got to us, the general consists was that the door was bland. Needed salt and pepper. NEEDED THEM. I ordered a Crab Cake Benedict, it cost 20$. The cakes were really processed, and small. Over all the quality of the food did not meet up to the cost of said food. Don't consider myself ever coming back.",

This is the most disappointing experience I have ever had a McCormick and Schmick's restaurant!  The hostess admitted they were understaffed, but that was only a small part of the problem. The salmon ordered by my side was, simply, ACCEPTABLE; nothing remarkable. My grand-daughter ordered scampi, which was TERRIBLE! It had 4 very small shrimp in it and they forgot the GARLIC! I ordered prawns. Apparently, they think prawns are small to medium shrimp . I had 5 of whatever they were all stuck together. I never mind spending $$$$ for GOOD restaurant experiences, but this was NOT one of them. VERY Disappointing!!!",

    "text": "Truthfully this was the worst dining experience at this caliber restaurant I've ever had.  My wife and I were in Charlotte for a romantic weekend after spending essentially the last three weeks apart.  I've dined at the Raleigh McCormick & Schmick's and it was fabulous so I thought this was a safe bet.  First, the raspberry Mule's were loaded in cheap syrup that over sweetened the drinks....  I'm not sure if they use fresh raspberries in Raleigh but there was a clear difference.  I ordered the crab and shrimp stuffed salmon and my wife ordered the filet mignon.  While I would classify my salmon as overcooked, it was not done so poorly that I felt I needed to send it back.  I do think that it was very substandard for a restaurant who's average meal with a drink is north of $50/person and specializes in seafood.  My wife's steak on the other hand was an insult to all foodies and chefs in the world.  This unholy strap of shoe leather was ordered as \"medium RARE\" and is shown as the more done in the two photos I've attached to this review.  We immediately alerted the waiter who did what any good waiter at a restaurant (high or low end) would do.  He agreed it was badly overcooked and immediately took the plate to have another cooked.  The slightly less done photo was their second attempt at medium rare.  Meanwhile I've finished my meal and our \"romantic\" evening has been derailed by what I can only assume was some griddle jockey in the back who moonlights for Huddle House.  It's not that I have anything against Huddle House.... In fact, I really like Huddle House but you get what you pay for.  When I order a $40 dollar steak, I expect to get it done properly.  By this point I was pretty angry but my wife convinced me to give them a chance to see what they would do.  Well, they charged me for these catcher's mitts is what they did.  Moreover, I'm pretty sure they were strips and not filets.  Typically I finish what my wife doesn't eat but these were so poorly done that I walked away hungry.  The manager never once came out to check on us when she found out we were upset and she made no effort to proactively correct the situation and try to make a customer happy on a very clear misfire by her chef.  In fairness, she did remove the steak when I asked to speak with her to complain but no further effort was made to address the overcooked fish that I told her about nor any concessions made for the fact that my wife and I were unable to enjoy our romantic dinner together.  Chefs make mistakes but I've never seen a chef at a restaurant at this level send out a well done steak that had been ordered as medium rare.....  TWICE!  The managers job is to keep these things from happening and when they do, make it right with the customer.  They missed on all points.  I can't say the experience was an entire train wreck though.  Our waiter was fantastic and managed the situation as best he could.  In my opinion, both the chef and manager should be fired....  You can't miss this badly at this level.  If our waiter is smart, he'll find another establishment to work at.  This one is certainly not worth his talents.  I will never eat here again.",

Our server (I'm not going to mention her name) while very friendly was either distracted by other tables or not as concerned with us because we only had 2 appetizers and a couple of Caesar salads (event though our bill was still $94). My first complaint is that it took probably around 15 minutes to get my dirty martini, in all fairness I wasn't sure what I wanted to drink when my friend ordered hers and ordered mine when she came back to get our food order but I had to pull another waitress aside and ask if she could check on my drink after 15 minutes. So she brings that with our salads a few minutes later. It took longer for our appetizers to get there and my friend mistakenly ordered another martini that we had to split and slam because we were going to be late for our show and finally my friend had to go up to the hostess stand to have someone come cash us out. We were there for almost an hour and a half by the way. Very disappointing and definitely won't be going back before our next show at Time Warner this Sunday or possibly ever.",

We started with calamari and oysters (fried). Both were lightly battered, fresh and flavorful.  In fact, I wish the oysters had been available as an entree.  Next up was the mixed seafood grill (salmon, shrimp scampi, stuffed shrimp and scallops).  I enjoyed everything except the scampi, which was a bit dry.  The salmon was prepared perfectly.  The dish was served with a cheddar mash and veggies.  My companion ordered 'shrimp trilogy' and had great things to say.  Wine list is pretty good.  The atmosphere was also nice - we were tucked away in a booth that made it quite cozy.  Best part of the experience - our server was wonderful!

After much debate I decided to go with the salmon since it's one of my favorites, and wow.  It was cooked perfectly, and the crab and shrimp stuffing was to die for.  A little pricey but worth it.",

I ordered the blackened fish tacos and my coworker had the Salmon Florentine Penne.  The waitress asked if we wanted bread and we said yes.  It took about 10 minutes to get our bread, which was about 1/4 of  loaf (4 small slices) we polished that off pretty quickly and waited about another 10 minutes to get our food.  The blackened fish tacos were OK, the fish was a little over cooked, but the flavor was pretty good.  My coworker said the salmon florentine penne was OK too.  Our waitress never checked back at all throughout our lunch.  Don't waste your time here, the service was bad and I've had better seafood elsewhere.",

    "text": "Disappointing meal, but an OK dining experience.  My wife and I were going out for a date night in Uptown, with dinner and a play.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was great.  Our waitress was very kind and attentive -when he was at our table- more on that in a moment.  It was St. Patrick's Day, which we did not take into account when we booked it, but we had an early reservation and the restaurant was nowhere near full.  Our meal started with drinks, a cab for the wife, and a \"craft\" beer for me.  Their \"craft\" selections were not actually craft, but they had 2 lesser \"big beer\" brands, Lagunitas and Ballast Point. I ordered the Lag, but they were out, so I got the BP instead.  The sourdough bread to start the meal was fantastic.  But at this point, we had already been there 30 minutes getting drinks and bread.  Then the waiter came to take it apps order.  I asked about the Oysters Rockefeller; the waiter thought they were on special tonight, but had to go check with the kitchen.  When he came back, he confirmed, and he went to place the app order.  When he came back, we then ordered entrees.  The wife ordered the double lobster tails; I inquired about either the fish & chips or the fried shrimp.  The waiter suggested doing both, adding shrimp to the fish platter, which I took him up on.  Then we waited a while longer for our Oysters.  When the Oysters Rock came out, they looked great and tasted very good.  Great presentation, and it looked like a dollop of hollandaise on top of each oyster, but it tasted more like cheese whiz.  Still, the oysters tasted great. But at this point, we had been there almost an hour.  There were just very slow gaps in service, but the waiter was very polite each time he visited us.  Finally, our food arrived.  This was the most disappointing part of the experience.  The twin lobster tails.... Were each 4oz tails.  Very small broiled tails.  Tasty, but just not much.  They were served with mashed potatoes and a lobster bisque as a gravy.  Potatoes were just OK, and her tails weren't much.  She expected more for $35.  We considered asking out waiter to add a third trail to make the $45 lobster plate, but we didn't think we'd have time before the show.  For my meal, the 5 shrimp were very tasty, but slightly on the rubbery side.  Good flavor, but it seemed they were a bit overcooked.  The fries were OK but not crispy.  The travesty was the cod planks.  Good flavor, but the texture was way off.....the batter was spongy and soft instead of crispy and crunchy.  It was like - it had been sitting under a heat lamp for much of the 20-minute gap between our apps and our entrees.  And to be clear - there were still a lot of empty tables around the restaurant at this point; they were not 'slammed.'  At this point, we had 15 minutes before showtime, so we cashed out and walked over to the Blumenthal.  We were glad for a dinner date in a nice spot, but we won't be back because the food wasn't as nice as the restaurant.",

    "text": "It's hard to even describe what a hot mess this place was. Last night we went on a business dinner there. We had a reservation and were seated right away. There were several parties there including a wedding and a 25th birthday party.  Individually, most of these things aren't a big deal, but collectively, we left saying WTF?! As we sat down, we heard the bride screaming and crying to the management staff for several minutes. Someone also knocked over a decorative plate that nearly hit us and caused a huge crashing noise.  Before we even ordered, two different waiters came up to us with meals and appetizers that weren't for us. We ordered 3 steaks and a fish meal, oysters of each kind on the menu and a bottle of wine.  After a long period of time (~20 minutes from when we sat down), the wine finally arrived.  The oysters came to the table with no explanation of which was which, no utensils, no condiments, no lemons.  Each of us who ordered steaks sent them back. Mine looked like beef jerkey on the outside, and completely still alive on the inside. Plus, it was cold to the touch. The other two were also cold. The fish was in good shape.  We still heard the bride yelling, saw her go back to their area and then come out crying, her whole wedding party following her shaking their heads in disappointment.  Our steaks come back, mine was warmer, but absolutely still alive in the middle (I asked for medium-rare so I expected some pink, but I am telling you, it was just rarer than rare). After sending it back once, which is already unlike me, I was perplexed as to what to do next. I could not eat my fairly expensive steak, so I sent it back a second time. At this time I also ordered another glass of wine. When my steak came back, it was still not what it should have been for a medium rare steak. I took a few bites and decided to be done with it. My glass of wine never came. When the checks came, the waiter offered me a free desert to make up for my poorly executed steak. We declined just to get out of there faster, and I made sure my never-delivered glass of wine was not on the bill.  We paid and left more disappointing by that dining experience than I have ever been.  It seemed like absolutely NO ONE knew what they were doing from the host staff, to the managers, to the wait staff, to the chefs. It was absolute chaos, which our table commented several times during this meal. What a horrible, horrible experience for a place with a fairly hefty price tag. I paid $40 for a steak I could not eat. No manager came by to ask how our meal was, no one offered to make me an entirely new steak, etc. Just incredibly disappointing. You would think a chain like this would have it's shit together, but it did not. Will not return ever, which is not what they should want with people traveling for work on an expense account. Total bummer.",

    "text": "Walking into McCormick & Schmick's was interesting. It reminded of any other semi high class diner. But it seems like they were a little disorganized as we had a reservation for 5 and we were led to a table that was still being set up. The only thing was that they were setting up for 6. We told them that we only had 5, and that there was an extra seat. We had to repeat this maybe 3 or 4 times until they got it and understood and took the extra seat and set of silverware off the table. You would think to get the table ready before seating down the customers right? Especially if you're charging $20+ for entrees. Anyways, after being seated, we received customized menus which was an interesting touch. We were celebrating 3 birthdays as our schedules have not lined up until now. \"Yeah, that's nice Bruce, get on with the food.\" I know. So this is what we had:  For our appetizer we started off with stuffed mushrooms which were flavorful. The mushrooms were stuffed with crab with a chowder type sauce. I liked the touch of green onions as it gave it a kick at the very end and it rolled off my tongue. The bowl of clam chowder was tasty as well, the flavor was full as in thick, but it wasn't extremely like sloppy like so not overbearing. There were a good amount of clams in the soup. The only thing I regretted was that I wished I didn't put a whole packet of oyster crackers in. I think it would've been better with maybe half the packet or even a third of it.  For the main course, I ordered the McCormick's Seafood Trio. The dish wasn't too bad. I ordered it because well, if a dish was named after the restaurant better believe that it better be good and represents the restaurant. The dishes came with 2 stuffed shrimps with crab, 3 big pieces of broccoli, 4 pieces of shrimp, a healthy slab of mashed potatoes, and a small piece of salmon that was salted with salt and pepper. It was filling, and offered a good representation of several of the other dishes that were offered on the menu. There was one caveat in our meal that gave me a sour taste in my mouth.  Our experience with the Cedar Sockeye Salmon lacked severely. One of my fellow dinner mates ordered this on the waiter's request, and it failed horribly. The salmon literally had no taste and the salmon was room temperature and not hot. When I tasted it, it tasted like the chef or someone forgot to glaze it or even marinate because it was just a slab of salmon, no taste. However on the upside, when told about the lacking dish, the restaurant took it back and gave my dinner mate another dish immediately. I sort of wanted to see what the chef said if he ate it and see what it tasted like. For that, this restaurant gets some points...   ...What this restaurant doesn't get is what we saw on the receipt... And that was that we returned the dish and the reason was because we didn't like it, not because the fish had no flavor. So you're saying the lack of flavor in the food is our fault, not the chef's/restaurant's. Right. I mean why is that even on the receipt?  My overall personal experience of this restaurant was just alright. It wasn't the best thing I've ever had, nor was it the worst. It was mediocre at best. The food was alright, the service was not too bad and what saved them from 2 stars. There were highs and lows when I went here so that's why I have to settle for 3 stars.",

    "text": "So I ate here with my husband for Christmas. We originally had planned to cook at home, but a family emergency left us with no time to grocery shop and prepare, so dinner reservations were the next best option. We waited at the bar to be seated for our reservation, they were running 15 minutes or so behind, no big deal. I had a good glass of wine while we waited. We were seated and ordered, and our waiter was great! Then sometime between receiving an appetizer and dinner, a waitress lost the balance on the tray she was carrying and dropped the tray (full of dirty dishes) on my head and shoulder. She was mortified and I felt bad for her. It hurt for sure, but I wasn't bleeding and it was Christmas, so I didn't make a scene. The food was good and we got dessert, which was also good. The check came and there was no sort of compensation for the incident previously mentioned. I was sort of surprised, but again, no damage done (except I did find some food in my hair later). The next day, my husband finds an extra credit card charge (maybe for the dishes broken on my head?) and called the restaurant, who assured that they would call him back at a certain time. No call has been received and now we're disputing the charge on the card. Fortunately this isn't the only good steak house in Charlotte, because I doubt we'll be going back.",

I don't know about you but I love happy hours because of those single digit prices you see all over the menu, lol.   $5 chicken lettuce wrap was tasting great along with that sauce and roasted chicken, there was plenty chicken for 5 bucks. $7 buffalo shrimp was just as great, spicy and yummy, went well with my beer and the $3 hummus with fried pita, ah man pita just reached another level.  the hummus was super flavorful, spiced just about right with smooth consistency. The bar area was full so had to sit outside, thankfully it was not chilly as the HH seating is only at the bar or outside.",

In addition they have $1 shrimp and $1 oysters on Wednesdays. Luckily it was a Wednesday so we ordered a dozen shrimp and two dozen oysters. The shrimp were HUGE!!! And the oysters were really taste and good size. Both were served over a bed of ice so they stayed nice and chill.   We got some drinks, but even with happy hour, most of the mixed drinks were $7-$9. I was kinda hoping for a $5 martini steal......Regardless the drinks were good and I would definitely return after a hard day of work! :-)",

I got the salmon en croute which was pretty good but was lacking salt much like my sauteed mushrooms and spinach.  The same was said for the stuffed salmon he got. For the price our meals were I expected there to be way more flavor in our food but it was severely lacking in seasoning. I would come back to see if the steak is anything special.",

There aren't any real good drink specials so expect to pay regular prices.    Now back to the customer service.  Like many people have posted the waiter/waitresses/bartenders ignore you.  And why wasn't I offered a glass of water with my drink.  I had three drinks while there and my friend had two glasses of wine.  No water was offered.  Initially the waitress came over because I was looking around the room in shock because it wasn't busy.  My face said everything.   Nearly 10 minutes before someone  approached us.  They really need to work on their customer service.",

They have a great $1 oyster special on Wednesdays and their entire happy hour menu is very good. They have great specials and they are served throughout the entire bar area. When I went for dinner instead of just Happy Hour I was disappointed as to how loud the dining area was. The service was mediocre and truly did not think the food was any better than what they were currently serving at the bar.   I highly recommend McCormick & Schmicks for happy hour, especially on Wednesdays. Besides that there are better options for seafood and steak throughout the city.",

Food was mediocre.  The GF menu advertised things that no longer existed. My daughter ordered crab legs and menu says that she would corn and potatoes. She received the potatoes, however, when we asked about the corn we were told it no longer comes with corn. Evidently the GF menu had not changed since 2012.  My son ordered a dish that is no longer offered but was not informed until after our waiter placed our order. When we finally received our food it was ok. Sea food had a very fishy taste. Steak was great.  Husband said his scallops were good.  Over all it was an ok experience. For $300 I will most likely not be back, especially when there are really great restaurants out there.",

This location is in the heart of uptown so it's a good place to watch what's going on outside.  It was a little busy during happy hour and I think that they were understaffed because there was a delay in getting our food and drinks.    I ordered the fish tacos with southwest slaw ($5) - great portions for the price and a half dozen oysters - blue point. I was a little disappointed in the oysters - as they cost $2.45 each. There was a lot of shell in them like they hadn't been shucked properly and some were pretty tiny even though the waitress advertised them as being the biggest ones on the menu.  My boyfriend ordered the calamari ($5) and coconut shrimp ($9). The calamari was OK but they put in some other fried veggies which I thought was a cop out.  I had one glass of the zinfandel and my boyfriend had one or two drinks and the bill came out to around $60.00. We should have just stuck to the HH menu.  Also, my one complaint about this location was that this is supposed to be an upscale-isn seafood restaurant and the bathrooms were a bit janky.",

One egg was over cooked and hard while the other was running before it got to the table. I let the server know and he did not address it. There was barely any hollandaise sauce. The biscuits and gravy were cold. The kid's scrambled eggs were overcooked. We had to request jelly for the toast, all the had was marmalade. It took forever for anyone to check on us. Our waters were never refilled. We let our server know of our dissatisfaction and then had to asks for the manager. The manager did comp our entree to her credit.

We had a reservation and as we waited on the rest of our party I noticed the grade of such a fancy restaurant to only be a 91. Red flag for me. Usually I would leave any place below 95 but like I said we were meeting friends and had a reservation. When we received our food half of it was cold. No one was happy about that. The portions were very small for such steap prices...4 stalks of asparagus cost like 8 dollars. The bread is awful. Taste like communion crackers. No flavor at all. I normally do not go to places with such a hefty price tag on there food but it was a rare night out with friends. No one in our group was impressed with our food nor our wait staff. We got 0 refills on our drinks and seen our waitress once before our check was brought to us. My husband ordered the 8oz filet mignon with mashed potatoes and asparagus I ordered the 6oz (had to send it back due to it being completely raw in the middle), the wedge salad, and mushrooms and we both got water...total 99 dollars!!!! Never again. Update: [once I posted this review someone reached out to me to let me know that someone would call me to speak to me about my experience. No one ever called me. So the rating stays at a 1 for Me. Like I said never going back.]",

Considering how outrageous their prices for a la carte dinners, we felt that this was the only way any of us would even think of going here.  Service was great, along with the drinks.  Food was simply OK.  Not fancy, not something that you would oooo and ahhhh about and certainly not if you paid almost $200 for a couple off the regular menu.  Save this place for expense account meals.  You can do far better at other restaurants for far less.",

We visited for Queen's Feast (Restaurant week). I enjoyed the coconut shrimp for appetizer - nice crunch, and tasty mango compote to eat with the shrimp and create just that added contrast of flavor and nice plating look. For entree had the beef medallions with potato and Brussels sprouts. Beef was tender and flavorful and enjoyed the side dish combo of veggies. For dessert had the creme brulee topped with a strawberry, blackberry and blueberries. The creme brulee was creamy and by far the best I've had. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. Excellent service. Overall ambiance was nice. We will definitely return. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

Their menu for this occasion is not start it has six to eight different entrees.  Today I had parmesan crusted chicken,  and some heavenly mashed potatoes, which was extraordinarily pleasing to my palate. Dee,  my waitress was extraordinary and overly  accommodating.

We were sat pretty quickly but then waited for 10+ minutes for a server. I got up to find someone and immediately the manager came over. Jenna was super sweet and we reset our attitude and would give it another chance.  Our server wasn't around a lot after we got our food but did check on us right when we got our food and when we were half way done. My husband had a filet and had finished his wine and wanted to get another glass. So when the server stopped by when we were halfway done he ordered another glass. We waited and it didn't come. My husband went to the bathroom and while he was gone Jenna had stopped and asked if he needed another glass.  I let her know we were waiting on a glass. She said she would check on it. Wait ANOTHER 10 minutes and the server stopped by and asked about his wine and apologized that he hadn't brought it. My husband was eating the last 2 bites of his steak and explained he wanted it to drink with his steak.  We canceled the glass of wine and it got taken off.  The server was very nice but delivery of service was terrible. We are in town for a nice weekend checking out Charlotte and just wanted an easy, quiet dinner and paid over $130 for terrible service. I usually try to avoid chain restaurants and I think this will remind me why I don't eat at them. Overall, we would never return and will let the Marriott where we are staying know how terrible the service was.",

When we walked in, there were about 10-15 customers in the entire restaurant. We sat at the bar and took several minutes to be greeted. We never received our mussels appetizer. By the time we realized it wasn't coming we also realized our entrees would be an additional 15 minutes on top of the 20 minutes we were already waiting after having ordered.  I ordered the Alaskan king crab. Probably the lamest entree I've ever ordered period. The portion was definitely not the correct size, it wasn't even the correct kind of crab. I was changed an extra $6 for \"lobster mashed potatoes\" which was pretty much boxed potatoes with a scoop of lobster bisque on top. My boyfriends meal came with the wrong side and the presentation was a literal \"what the %!@$\" moment, it was so sloppy. Bartenders were not much more attentive to any other customers after we came in, as I noticed food being sent back or incorrect. Long story short, if I knew this was a chain steakhouse I would have went somewhere else.",

They both did not mind taking photos of us. Now the food I have to say was exceptionally good. I ordered a salmon rigatoni dish and added 6 jumbo shrimp for 7.00. It had just the right amount of sauce and the flavors were delicious. The salmon was well proportioned to the dish as well. 2 of the ladies had chicken pasta dishes and the birthday girl had some sort of steak dish. There were no complaints at the table on mmm's. The atmosphere was very relaxed but not so much so that people weren't laughing and enjoying there meals. I would recommend this place  for a date night or get together with friends. Side note: It was very cute that the menus had Happy Birthday with her name and they brought out a desert just for her. Will be visiting here again. Happy Eats!!!",

I ordered a steak with mashed potatoes and it arrived on a huge plate that made my meal seem really sad. I was a little disappointed that sides are not included in the price of the meal, but I guess this is common with most steak restaurants. My boyfriend got a pasta dish that he also thought was ok.

To start, there are some 40 or so tables in this place and I came in just before 5 on a Monday and we were the only customers in the place, the next 3 groups that came in were seated right next to us, I mean why did I have to hear every conversation every customer had?  Then we spent about 10 minutes looking at the menu ONLY to be told that was the lunch menu and what we wanted wasnt offered then!  THEN, the food came, OK I'm only too happy to pay top dollar for outstanding food but $20 per crab cake and that was pretty bland with some boring veggies and a steak that was 1 part beef and 4 parts salt, is a great way to keep the customers away.",

When my food came out I had mixed vegetables and rare meat. The waiter said she would replace the vegetables and then she'll get the manager. The manager says to me do you want me to warm the rare steak up that I asked for well done. Huh hell no!!!!!!! The manager only took off $20 of $200 ticket!!!! Sorry management this definitely needs to be addressed. And then we were told he was a new manager #Sorry",

    "text": "Wondering around uptown looking for a bar seat, quick light lunch and an afternoon glass of vino (shhh) around 2pm. I have eaten at the Schmick's SouthPark, so I swung into the Uptown location. Figured it's reliable and I was hoping for a friendly bartender to chat with.   I really don't get the hype over this place! Everytime I eat there I pretend (to my big Mccormick fan friends) that its great, but honestly, I do not think the service nor the food quality is better than your average Red Lobster.  The \"Oversized\" prawns, sold by the prawn for $2.50/ea are anything, but oversized and one of mine looked anything, but fresh. The (one, tiny) crab cake I had was tasty, but I have had much much better. It was definitely not \"lump\" and overpriced ($11 bucks).  Last, the bartender was so consumed in talking to her regular about her own life and barely seemed to have any interest, even when I threw out several safe conversation icebreakers, to talk to her other guests (me and one other guy).   Nonetheless, I still left 20% and thanked them for the \"experience\", but I think that was definitely the last time I waste $31 ($$$ whoa!) at a Mccormick. I much rather swim over to Bonefish.   Positive note: timely",

I got the stuffed salmon and it was okay. It comes with mashed potatoes, carrots and peas. I couldn't really taste the lobster or crab that was supposed to be stuffed in the salmon. The mashed potato was pretty good though. My friend ordered the New York strip and it was delicious even though the price was a little high and it only came with asparagus and half a grilled tomato. The iced water tastes weird. The server did not ask if I'm finished before taking my plate away. The bread was hard on the outside and it wasn't anything special. We came here on a Sunday night and the restaurant was nearly empty. We ordered creme brulee for dessert. The size is surprisingly bigger than we expected. There were mixed berries on top and a mint leaf. The custard was a little soft but overall it was good. The atmosphere of the restaurant is good, with dim lighting and classy plate settings. Overall, we enjoyed our meal but it was not worth the price.",

We had reservations and we were seated about on time. They were busy, but not insanely so.    We sat in Steven's section and it should have been an omen that I heard a woman complaining about his service before we sat down.  He took our drink and appetizer order and then disappeared.  He checked in about 10 minutes later as our drink order had \"slipped his mind\".   We had calamari and mussels which arrived without any appetizer plates or little forks or bowl for empty shells for the mussels.  It was all tasteless...that's the only word to describe it.  No seasoning, no reason to eat it.    We had ordered our meals before the appetizers arrived but the waiter forgot what we ordered and had to come and ask us again.  After about 30 minutes, he checked in again saying \"part of the food was up...and what was it we had again?\" Oh boy!  Well we got served about 15-20 minutes later so about 45 minutes after we finished appetizers.  I had the mahi-mahi special which at $33 was no bargain.  The portion size was tiny, the fish luke-warm and severely over cooked and burnt on one side. It was so tough I had to take a drink of water to get it down.  Obviously my food had been under the warming lamp long before everyone else's had started.    My husband's sea bass was average and my son's shrimp was pretty good...but, the pacing was so awful the meal was already ruined.  The waiter disappeared again and we finally flagged him down to get our check.  I was looking forward to dessert and coffee but didn't have an extra hour to spare for him to forget it...then bring it...then disappear again.  All in all the meal was very boring, uninspired and served by someone who should never have been allowed on the floor.   He wasn't rude, he just didn't care and didn't seem to know what he was doing.   Won't be going back!",

Our server was quick with getting drink orders and bringing bread, but took FOREVER to actually bring the check... She took even longer to come back to pick it up and run the card... That part was the worst... The food itself was interesting... We all got the beef medallions, but the results were incredibly varied... They were presliced as well, which wasn't a problem since it let you see the doneness... I ordered mine medium well and some pieces were closer to medium, while the others were a mix of medium well and well done...  The portions were a bit small... I normally never finish a restaurant meal because they're too big and I cleaned my plate... lol  Overall, it was decent, but it could have been better with a more evenly cooked entree and faster table service...",

Basically American tapas with a bit of a seafood/tex-mex influence.  The tasty: pesto pizza (although its a bit small), fish tacos, and I'm guessing a sort of Cajun-style shrimp (I haven't been around long enough to really know what that means but it was good).  The less-than-tasty: hummus (too much cumin!), the mussels (well, who thought it was a good idea to put cilantro on mussels? Really!)  Also note that they had some martini/cocktail specials, between 5-7 bucks each - I got a raspberry martini that tasted like a lollipop and didn't give any buzz, so meh.

To me it seemed like the whole wait staff was working off Saturday night's party and Sunday morning's hangover. Patrons were crammed in to one section even though the restaurant was fairly empty. Even though the restaurant was empty, the hostess still had trouble finding a table to seat us. I could then overhear servers asking if our table belonged to them. The table that was Seated after us had drinks before we even found our waiter. His name was Thomas, but we didn't learn that until our bill arrived as he didn't find it necessary to introduce himself. Beware of the calamari, it also has pickled vegetables, more than likely you wont be able to determine what you are eating until you bite into it. The chicken fettuccine was good, the stuffed shrimp were small and overcooked but the lump crab meat was yummy. I will not be back... unless it's only to drink wine, they do have good wine selection. It was quite a disappointing meal and definitely not the meal that I wanted to start my honeymoon with.",

The Mrs. does not remember what she ate, but probably nothing memorable or out of the ordinary. Recently when the Mrs. accompanied colleagues to an early lunch at this McC & Schm on South Tryon Street in Charlotte, NC, she was expecting nothing out of the ordinary again. The Mrs. wanted a meal without any fish or meat, but there were no enticing vegetarian offerings.  So she asked the very nice server if she could have the salmon rigatoni ($14) minus the salmon.  The accommodation could be made.  Nice. The bowl of rigatoni contained small pieces of asparagus stalks and mushroom shreds. a tiny bit of artichoke, and a very liquid pesto cream sauce (not very pesto-ey tasting).  No problem.  It was more important to enjoy this lunch with the colleagues. The Mrs. ate only half the bowl of soupy rigatoni, then the nice server boxed up the other half to take back to the office and finish later. The surprise came when the bill arrived.  There was no price reduction for leaving out the salmon from the dish.  It was full price, without the top-billed salmon.  The server informed no accommodation could be made on the price.  The total bill, including tax and very nice tip, came out to $19. Upon returning to the office, the Mrs.' very sensitive stomach was unhappy; perhaps it was the cream sauce.  She threw out the uneaten boxed half of this meal. This lunch of half a bowl of meatless/fishless pasta wound up costing $19.  Way too expensive for an adult-focused fast-food chain-restaurant. The service was nice, the food not so much.  It was the service which earned it the rating. NOTE:  This meal was not on a work expense account. The Mrs. does not think it is worth going back.",

They are in the process of a remodel but seemed to have it neatly kept.",

When she did not have availability, she offered to phone the Uptown location.  I was on hold for less than two minutes when she came back with:  a.)  my reservation at my preferred time and b.)  news that the location was handicapped accessible.  I appreciated that service was from the regular menu rather than buffet (an issue for my guest in a wheel chair) and food was good.  One suggestion for improvement would be that, if you see a guest pushing a wheelchair toward the one manual door, might have been nice for someone to offer to hold the door.  The valet did earn major brownie points and a bump in his tip, when he offered to fold the chair and put it in the vehicle for me upon departing.  Valet parking is free but please be sure to tip!  Overall, grateful that a full staff of very professional people had agreed to work on Christmas Day for our benefit.  Will go back.",

I did the restaurant week menu which, for me, included a Caesar salad, stuffed mahi mahi and creme brulee.    The salad was dry and could use more dressing.  Wasn't the worst I've had but really nothing special.  Now the mahi mahi was what I really looked forward to.  Big disappointment.  There was barely any flavor to this dish.  While it was rich (stuffing had creamy consistency), I really thought about adding salt.  Yes, salt, to a seafood dish.    To end the experience, I ordered the Creme Brulee.  Didn't think I could go wrong.  It literally tasted like a snack pack pudding.  It must have been pulled from a fridge and sent to the table.  There was no crunchy, caramelized sugar top.  Honestly, it was pudding with 2 blueberries and 1 raspberry thrown on top.    Service was also disappointing.  We went on a Sunday evening and there were maybe 4 other tables taken in the whole place.  After we finished our dessert we waited and waited for our server.  I actually had to get up and ask another waiter to get her.    Not sure why people love this place.  I wasn't feeling it!",

Our glasses were never empty and any trash on the table disappeared just as soon as it was created. Our dinner was served in a timely manner and our drinks well made. Everything was exactly the way I remember it from my youth my disappointment was how far it's fallen in manner of class. McCormick and Shmick used to have a dress code and an expectation of elegance. We dressed to go out and found ourselves surrounded by people speaking loudly on their cellphones and in t-shirts. Not only has the standard for their dress code died but so has their desire to create a comfortable atmosphere I felt like I was in a noisy McDonald's with crying children and cellphone conversations as well as cellphone arguments going on all around me. The food is still wonderful but it's not what it used to be.",

During the last visit, the hubby had the crab & shrimp stuffed Salmon and I had the Filet Mignon w/crab stuffed shrimp.

    "text": "In Uptown for a business trip.  A group of us stopped in McCormick & Schmick's looking to get dinner.  We didn't have reservations but they did get us a table after ~ 15 minute wait.  Hostess was very accommodating.   Place was jammed for the Tuesday night.  Bar section had no seating available.  There was a section between the bar and dining area that appeared to be hosting a private event.    I would call this semi upscale dining.  Menu mainly consists of seafood options.  Entree prices are in the mid $20s and up.  I got the Beef Medallion Bordelaise with a side of mushrooms and spinach.  $27 entree.    Drink selection was good, but expensive, especially the cocktails.  The Ancho Chili Margarita was a disappointment.    The food was good.  I felt the portions were small.  In fact, I left hungry and had to grab a flatbread from my hotel's restaurant.    I doubt I will come back.  Uptown has too many options that are better.  I seriously doubt they will miss my business though based on the number of customers they had on a Tuesday night.",

My sons was fine but my fillet did not look like a fillet at all it was shaped like the state of Florida and look like it had been run over by a Ford truck.  I also ordered the garlic potatoes which were dry and starchy.  The manager came over and offered to have them cook me something else but by that time my son was finished with his meal so I declined, they made no other offer of reparation, Not even to comp a drink",

I had to get a side of sauce to try and cover up the gross-factor, and picked all the peppers out myself. Unfortunately we didn't get bread so I ate nothing. I received one refill and sat thirsty for the last 20 minutes of my 'meal'. The meal came with two vegetables and was asked if youd like a salad-- Thinking the salad was substituted for a 'vegetable' and not an 11$ add on--the answer was yes--then was very disappointing to find this out UPON receiving our check. Darryl then takes my plate--unbeknownst to me--goes to the back, and places it in a to-go container. I don't like my food touched, mishandled, or ill-prepared, and I suffered from all of the above. Needless to say I will not be returning, taking my mom, or any other loved one to this place for that matter!  It's several OTHER steak houses on tryon Rd in Charlotte NC--GO THERE!

The presentation of the food was probably one of the worst that I've seen in a long time.   Complimentary bread? No. Didn't happen. We asked another waitress whether this was normal, and she answered simply: \"You're supposed to receive complimentary bread.\" Ha!   It's been 1.5 hours thus far... still haven't received our meal. It's 11:05, the restaurant is technically closed.   The couple behind us? Yes, they have received their bread, appetizer, and main course. Nice!   Update: the sweet server, whom unfortunately wasn't our personal waitress, Stephanie, who told us about the complimentary bread (that we received 2 hours in) really tried! I appreciate her efforts.   .. on a positive note, our requested 2 hour bread was good & the entree was decent. I will never return to this location.",

We were seated in a booth and our waitress  Parrish, I believe greeted us immediately and took our drink order. Frank didnt want apps, but I always do. So, I ordered the Arugula Strawberry Salad that had radishes, candied slivered almonds with a Honey Lemon Vinaigrette, delicious. They used baby Arugula and its strawberry Season, so they were sweet and delicious and played off nicely with my peppery arugula. I then ordered The Stuffed Shrimp with Crab meat with a Red Pepper White Cheddar Mash and Mixed Vegetables. I swapped out the mixed for some Sauteed Spinach, like I've never had. Im so mad I didn't ask how it was made. It was simply made but had such flavor, I guessing there was garlic, shallots, and wine in it, not sure.  Anyway, my shrimp were nicely stuffed with sweet crab and they were drizzled with a lemon butter sauce, I believe. I was very happy with my dish.  Frank Had the Palm Beach Mahi Grilled with Crab Potato Hash and a sweet Corn Bisque, although I dont remember the bisque, now that I think of it. Hmmmm......   Any, his fish was fresh and delicious and it sat atop the Crab potato hash, so good. We had the Walnut Apple Crumble with Cinnamon ice cream and split it. Enough for two. That was the perfect ending to this perfect meal. I'd definite;y go again. I dont know why they dont have more stars. I think you're nuts if you dont enjoy this place.Im a complainer, trust me and I was happy from start to finish her.  Btw, as I left, I saw someone's plate with the Halibut on top of rep pepper Risotto, OMG it looked so good, I wanted to go back in and eat again.  Ill be back, tho and I'm getting the Halibut.",

Stuck us in the back corner and leave us sitting there for 25mins to be exact.I literally had to get up go find the General manager Sean myself. He immediately started to give me excuses rather than a apology. Sent a out a free appetizer and that was it. What made it even worst is that by the time we got our food it was 10:50pm, which my order still didn't come out correct.  Completely unaware that they close at 11pm. Once 11pm struck they turned on all the lights in the restaurant (it's usually dimmed to set the mood). I get it but I feel like they shouldn't take reservations that close to closing time if they are going to be handled that way. I've never had such a bad experience. And the manager never came back by at the end of the meal to make sure we were satisfied. Safe to say I'll never go back !!!!",

Our waitress did not even have a clue what was on that menu nor did she know what wine was poured by the glass.  She misinformed us that a certain wine was available by the glass only to return and state it was only available by the bottle.  To make matters worse, the wine we wanted to order (we are aware of the retail price) was almost 4 times what you would pay retail.  That is too much of a mark-up for any restaurant!  We had to hunt her down for our checks and even then she did not get the correct items on the correct checks.    The corned beef sliders came with one small slice of corned beef on a bun which overpowered the meat.  Thankfully, you got three sliders per order so you could move the corned beef from the remaining two sliders to produce a slider that was edible.  Too many other places in Uptown to spend money for palatable food and knowledgeable wait staff.",

Of course all this cheap goodness came with a drink minimum, but ahem, that wasn't going to be a problem, and I was impressed with the mojitos. If you're gonna support the corporate beast, you could do worse than a drink, a couple treats and a $10 tab.",

    "text": "I managed to snag a 6:30 reservation at McCormick and Schmick's using OpenTable last Saturday night even though it was packed. When we arrived, we found the hostess pretty much turning away anyone without a reservation.  The hostess offered to let us sit faster in the bar area at a table, or we could wait for 15 minutes for a table outside the bar area. We opted for the bar table. For some reason, after we were sat, I received an email from OpenTable notifying me that my reservation had been \"cancelled\" by the restaurant, which was annoying because you get points for making and keeping reservations via OpenTable, which can later be redeemed for gift certificates. Because they cancelled my reservation, I didn't accrue those points.  That issue aside, our server was Susan, and she was fast and helpful. The food came out quickly, as expected since they had a fairly set Restaurant Week menu. My crab cakes were excellent, but my husband reported that his scallops were cold.  The service (and my crab cakes) are what jack this review up to 3 stars. They got it about half right. I can't say that I'd definitely return.",

The fries were soggy and the presentation left a lot to be desired starting with the grease slick at the bottom of the plate. The slaw was bland tasting mostly of ground cabbage with a very light mayo dressing. The fish was fine. The bread in a basket was thrown on the table at the end of the meal instead of at the beginning of the meal with no word from the waitress. Refills were placed on the table at the end of the meal when we were ready to leave - again not a word from the waitress. On top of everything, she overcharged us for an appetizer that we didn't have. So much for hoping to have a nice lunch. I've eaten at this chain before so I'll chalk it up to a bad day in the kitchen and on the floor.",

Lunch time wasn't that crowded which is why I was surprised that service was slow. We probably waited five minutes for someone to come and take a drink order. Our server was friendly, we just felt like it was slow. We did get some bread but that took a while to come out as well.   I was also surprised that there weren't any great lunch specials so  expect to still spend some money here. For meal I ordered a chopped salad with salmon. It was nothing special. To me, the salad was over dressed making the lettuce wilted. There were some bits of blue cheese but that was the most exciting part. The salmon was okay. A little dry and seasoned okay. I've just had better. For a place known for seafood, I was just expecting more.   It's definitely a place to take it slow. I've heard great things about happy hour. Maybe I just caught them on an off day.",

The desert to sum it all up was their peanut butter pie. The pie doesn't even need to be explained... it was superb!

As expected, good atmosphere and clean restaurant. Wait staff greeted us immediately and took our drink order. So had the lobster bisque which was fantastic. The crab cake entree was underwhelming and the apple pie was pretty good. What wasn't good was the service. Waitress never offered to refill my water and she botched up the check. First she offered to split the check for me and my buddy, took our cards, but she charged my card for his bill and vice versa and she never gave us the itemized bill. After running the cards she disappeared so we had to track down the manager to verify the bill being incorrect and then rerun the cards. Then after the second manager corrected the mistake, she returns finally to say \"my shift is ending, can I have the checks to close out\" REALLY??? Oh and she said \"it was a pleasure to serve you today\" No it wasn't as it showed in your lack there of. Disappointing because I love M&S. After having to call the manager over twice and then having to wait an additional 20minutes just to get the bill straight and to have nothing even offered for the inconvenience is textbook poor customer service.",

    "text": "Not sure where to start on this \"fine dining\" review. I was in town with some friends for the bar crawl & found myself craving a juicy ribeye. For starters, a gentlemen (Brandon) cleared our table & when we started making requests, he said he was a former employee and just helping out. Turns out, he may have just been the most helpful \"employee\" of the evening. Our waitress, Emma, brought our bread with no plates and took quite some time to bring out 3 - we were actually a party of 4. I should also add there were no utensils on our table, so after waiting too long for her to return, I opted to grab some from an unoccupied table. I took a sip of my water and noticed a lip print on my glass - not mine because I used a straw. Sigh!!! When my meal finally arrived, I had the vegetable of the day on my plate as a side instead of the mashed potatoes I ordered. I also asked for my Caesar salad to come out first - it came out with my entree. Thank goodness for the bread, or else I would've starved!  The ribeye I longed for was dripping with red instead of the medium well I requested. I ate it anyway because my goal was to end this disaster of a meal as fast as possible. When our waitress made another appearance  (we had to make our requests through wait staff walking by to serve other tables) I called her Taylor - not sure where I got that name from, to which she says \"It's Emily by the way.\" Perhaps I would've remembered that had I seen her more than once the entire evening!! To sum up a very long and scathing review, we left World of Beer & walked here b/c they were out of ribeyes. I thought this was the end of an unfortunate dining experience. I was wrong. M&S, you're not just a restaurant, but a brand, and I could not be more disappointed in my experience here. DO BETTER!!!!!",

    "text": "First time in Charlotte, NC, just arrived in town and was starving.  Remembered McCormick & Schmick's as a very nice restaurant from when I was growing up so I walked over for a small bite at the bar.  First thing I noticed was that there was a man passed out in his chair at the bar.  Nobody seemed bothered or cared.  I ordered the jumbo chilled shrimp cocktail off the happy hour menu and when it arrived it had not been deveined.  I looked on the internet and confirmed what I was seeing was in fact what I thought it was - the shrimp's intestinal remains.  I was really surprised that a place like McCormick & Schmick's would serve its customers with such low quality care.  The whole thing turned me off.  If you want to have a nice meal or sit at a nice bar, there appears to be no shortage in the area.  Eddie Vs, Ruth's Chris, BLT Steak, and I'm sure many others I just don't know are within eyesight.  Spend your time and money at a place that prepares and serves its food with pride.",

M&S has some amazing happy hour specials that are available in the bar area and on the patio (which is currently under construction). Note that the bar area includes several tables that can serve 2-4 people. The specials are available from 4-7, and some are even available until close. We stopped here before seeing Hamilton and got in at about 5:30. It got pretty crowded by 6:00 (there was also a Hornets game that evening).   I ordered my usual $5 cheeseburger which is probably the best deal in town. I mean, think about it, a fast food burger costs about $5 without a side but at M&S you get a small order of steak fries with it! The caveat for the happy hour deals is you have to purchase at least a $3.40 drink, but that's easy enough with a beer, soda, or cocktail.  The bartenders and the bar area staff have always been on point. While I don't always like to share \"best-kept secrets\", this is one worth sharing. If you can get here at 5 after work or before an event, then the happy hour is in amazing deal.",

My colleague also had a salad and it looked yummy as well.  Service was slow, and the dining area feels a bit stuffy and dated. Also, odd thing to point out, but the booths are INCREDIBLY uncomfortable. Something about the backs of the booth being too upright I believe.   This is a good place for a professional business lunch, but I'd go elsewhere if you are looking for a quick and casual bite to eat.",

    "text": "Came here for happy hour with a few good ppl. After multiple terrible experiences at the South Park location, I was sure I wouldn't be to this establishment again. Well, it was on the list of happy hour spots and I hadn't been to this location, so why not?  It was all good at first. We got there early and was able to get a table in the bar area. Our waiter came by in decent time and we ordered a round of drinks and food from the happy hour menu. I ordered a margarita and the fish tacos (2 per order). Margarita was good. I got through one of my fish tacos and was SURE I would be back for more because it really was that good, especially with the corn salsa.  Now I get to my 2nd taco and after one bite...there it was...a long string of black hair . Gross!  I told the waiter he apologized and offered another order of the tacos, I respectfully declined. But since I was still hungry, I ordered the coconut shrimp. Something I can see without any additional ingredients and definitely not wrapped up.  The shrimp came out fresh & hot, and it was also good. However, 4 shrimp for $9. Anyway, the waiter also brought out ONE taco, to compensate for the taco that had hair in it (even though I declined). He said we can have it, since it was made. I gave it to my friend, with no hair this time.  Time for checks and the tacos are still on my check. Come on guys. Even if I wanted the other ONE taco, that was a gross mistake. Where has this persons hair been? What has it been in? And what's been in it?? You could've taken it off the bill without me having to ask.  So once I requested the removal of the tacos from the bill, they granted my request, I paid and we were on our way.  1.5 stars - margaritas, the one taco w/o hair and the waiter was pleasant.",

We started with cocktails at the bar - I ordered and old fashioned against my better judgment and as soon as I saw it I regretted my order. It was huge. And if you know anything about old fashioneds, you know that's not a good sign. It looked so watery, and tasted probably worse than it looked.  Once seated for dinner we got the tuna tartare to start. They served it decomposed which was thoughtful if anyone at our table had dietary limitations, but we didn't specify that we did so it was kind of awkward to mix in the mustard, capers and onions into chopped raw fish.  We all ordered steaks and they were fine but nothing remarkable. The biggest offense was the veggies the steaks were served with. They had rainbow carrots as part of the veggie medley and they looked good, but were so al dente it was comical. We joked they were harder than if you had just pulled them out of the ground. Almost impossible to cut even with a steak knife.  Service was very friendly and attentive, but they didn't clear any plates or empty cocktail glasses from the table throughout the whole meal.",

She ordered fish and chips and I had the lump crab plate. The food came out in an acceptable time and then it went downhill fast. Hers was okay but the fish was a little salty but edible.   My plate was a mess! First of all the food was literally thrown to one side of the plate. No biggie I thought. One of my requirements is food must be hot or at least symbolically warm. The rice tasted like it came from the refrigerator to my plate and my veggies were lukewarm at best, however cooked perfectly and acceptable. I called our server over and told him about my expectations of hot food and specifically noted the rice. He stated he would \"take it back and have it warmed\". I made a point of warning him I wouldn't accept microwaved food and I told him to hold on while I pinched a corner of my crab cake for a temperature check. To my surprise it was very nice. He took my plate and the wait begins!  My wife ate her food and finished as the Jeopardy music played for me. Finally, my plate arrived. The veggies looked as if the had been microwaved to almost incinerator level. The rice was piping hot and glued together and the best was yet to come. They had eaten or forked away half of the crab cake!!! Wait...what?  The problem is, my plate should have been totally prepared from scratch and not reheated and picked on and sampled. I asked for a manager and he came over and agreed this was totally unacceptable behavior from the chef and offered to cook another fresh plate. He was totally shocked it had been sent back previously. I had to explain how this all transpired and he was blown away. Another plate, That's a NO from me. I will probably have nightmares about what would indigestible ingredients the chef probably would have added if given the chance. You would think that a minuscule portioned plate for $23.50 would have at absolute least, be warm.   I would love to see Yelp implement a negative rating option. It would come in very handy on this terrible experience. One star is too generous.",

    "text": "What makes a seafood restaurant pop?!  Is it the fresh catch sizzling in front of you smothered in a lemon butter sauce? Or perhaps the flaky tenderness of a salmon filet neatly presented before you with an artist's finesse? Maybe it's the crisp finish that the last Kumamoto oyster leaves on your palate before you embark on a great seafood adventure...  McCormick and Schmick will gladly take you to sea without the difficulty of chartering a ship and crew to find those gems of the ocean. Quite frankly, nothing begins a meal quite like the Oyster Sampler (12 oysters) that this great establishment can offer you. Even 3 orders later you won't feel weighed down by this fresh and juicy appetizer because it's light on the stomach and slightly sweet in taste. Aphrodisiac? I'm too busy eating to notice... then again I was also eating with a bunch of dudes, so go figure.   On one occasion, I found myself ordering a lemon crusted tilapia that literally melted the moment it was placed on my tongue. I could feel the remainder of its hot oil sliding down my lips. It began with a warm crispy bite, and turned to a subtle, but saliva-inducing fish flavor that ended nicely with a buttery finish. The portion is huge. Once you eat one of these, you're definitely going to be set for the night.   If you're looking for a sophisticated and clean range of flavors, I would suggest the Chilean Sea Bass or the Scarlet Snapper. Each dish is cooked perfectly and the weightlessness of each bite leaves you with no regret and addictive tendencies. Find yourself immersed in a world of nature's most raw and simple flavors that appeal to the eye as much as they do to your appetite.   For those who enjoying going to seafood restaurants and ordering steak, there's plenty of other meat options for you to choose from, but not worth mentioning here because you should probably be re-evaluating your life choices rather than reading about other people's fish experiences.  4/5 at Tryon location for delay in food. House wasn't even half-full. At least my glass was :)",

When we arrived we were seated at a table that was not as nice as it could've been.  When we asked whether we could be seated at a table that was just two tables down and seemed much better to us they said somebody else had \"snagged\" it already. Even though it took a long time before anybody actually arrived to be seated. We ordered, and it took an hour and 15 minutes to get served. Our server was completely uninterested.No apologies for the delay nor any explanations why people up on the table next to us who arrived after us already left even before we were served.  Our appetizer, the lobster bisque, was ok, my entree when it finally arrived was horrible. Overly salted and cooked until the fish was so dry it could've crumbled. The other two in the party were also not overwhelmed with the quality or the taste of their food (fish & chips, soggy and almost cold and scallops, quite undercooked). We waited for a while to see if our server would notice that I was not touching my food. Instead she asked me if I wanted a box. So I finally had to tell her the food was horrible. She didn't apologize. The manager took my meal off the bill. Certainly the food or the restaurant or the ambiance were not worth spending Christmas evening. There are plenty of other good restaurants in Charlotte. This one is totally off the list.",

Now we were finally seated.  Oh waiter.  Oh waiter.  Oh waiter.  He shows, we wait another 10 minutes enjoying eachother's conversation before our water glasses get filled.  Orders taken, appetizers arrive, soups & salads delivered (at this point waters are all empty), then main course arrives.   We ask for more water, as we are coming to the end of the main, water arrives.   Not the level of service you would expect from this type of an establishment.   My meal was meh.  The oysters were delicious.  Overall experience was lack luster.   It was like driving a Pinto when you should at least have been driving a Cadillac.  Just an FYI, Ruth Chris is less than a block away.",

A simply arugula salad w shrimp was overcooked and took almost 30 minutes to get to me.  I spent THREE hours at the South Park location (unwillingly) waiting for my and two others birthday celebrations. the not-even-melted Brie appetizer was served at room temperature french bread (this was supposed to be toasted) with over-cooked shrimp. All FIVE meals were served at varying degrees of room temperature, over cooked or the plate was burning hot from being under the heat lamp for too long. Did I mention how loooong it took for this inedible food to get to us?? I gave up keeping track of time after 45 minutes. After the manager was involved in this beyond frustrating \"meal\" she comped the desserts we had already intended on getting (birthdays) but never came back to check on us. Did I also mention they botched a lobster tail TWICE?  (Feel free to  check my other reviews and you'll see I'm fair with my reviews, this is not the rant of a bratty diner who wanted something for free - both visits were just That Bad!)",

I made a reservation for my family on Xmas eve and they called me a few times to tell me that they may not be able to accomodate my party of just two. Nevertheless, we went and got a table.  We were ignored for 22 minutes until Hannah got there...and then another waiter Mike told us that Hannah couldnt handle her 2 other tables so we would get us our waters and sodas...  Next....Hannah gets there... She did not know the menu at ALL! she couldnt tell us what vegetable came with the dish, what a berry drizzle was, and told us that the dish was smoked when it was simply grilled.  I ordered my dish and...low and behold, it wasn't even what i ordered.   A manager comes over, who was pleasant, but she defended Hannah, saying she was new. Im sorry, but if you work in a place that has 30 dollar dishes, you should know the menu. And not just look for a tip. Hannah is borderline moronic and i feel bad for her... They comped our dessert... Oh wait, that still showed up on the bill after our bad experience.....  The more experienced server even said that they dont get taste tests to reccommend the food.......",

    "text": "Visited on Thanksgiving and wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be. Sour dough bread not a favorite but we did partake as we waited for our food. Took longer than expected to place our order. Drink order got lost. Turkey was delicious but served as big slabs of turkey and not slices (awkward to deal with, cut and eat like a civilized human being). Got a salad that was ruined by the addition of bleu cheese, green olives and weird bacon bits. My fault on that one as I didn't notice the salad listed several lines above the grilled salad clearly showed these ingredients. NOT good. I picked out the bleu cheese and the olives. Too dark to easily pick out the weird bacon bits. I ate what was left as my mama taught me to always clear my plate but meal was not enjoyable. Tried the Chocolate Mousse Silk Pie and it was unlike any Chocolate Mousse Silk Pie I've ever had. It was so firm and hard to eat I thought it was frozen. Only way to eat it was to break it into chunks. Nothing silky about that. Bunch of rubble on the plate. Not sure why anyone thought it qualified as Chocolate Mousse Silk Pie. Got three raspberries with it and a little line of raspberry sauce on top. What a rip.  After dinner Irish coffee was made with instant coffee. Ugh. Who does that? For the cost of the meal they couldn't make real coffee? All in all not worth the 97$ we paid, including tip.",

    "text": "Christmas Day.  Yep.  Not many places open, but this one sure is, and they make you feel like it's okay that they're all working and you're not.      From beginning to end, our experience was very good.  Our Server could not have done a better job, nor have been more delightful.       We started with the Shrimp Kisses, unsweetened iced tea and their delicious sourdough bread.  The Shrimp Kisses were so well executed, which is hard to do.  Bacon-wrapped seafood in our experience is often not done right. This was very well done.  Bacon was well cooked, but the shrimp was not over-cooked.  Perfect!  Loved the corn relish under and the fried onions over.  Great appetizer and perfect for sharing!      Both of us (surprisingly) ordered the same entree: Shrimp Trilogy Buttermilk Fried, Stuffed, Scampi, Butternut Squash Orzo 27.95.  This also comes with: Red Pepper White Cheddar Mash.  I opted to substitute grilled asparagus for the butternut squash orzo, as I didn't see the need for two starches.  Husband was happy with as-is.    Our meals were very enjoyable!  Cheesy Mash needed a slight dash of salt....I requested cocktail and tartar sauces and were brought both quickly, which added to the enjoyment of the meal.  Very rich!  I was so glad to have the asparagus to off-set the richness a bit.  The fried shrimp was slightly over-fried and crunchy but dunked in cocktail sauce was still tasty.     Seriously full, I could only do coffee for dessert, but Husband managed some super moist carrot cake.  Half of which we brought home.     For those that poo-poo chain restaurants, there is something to be said about one that is working this hard to deliver quality and service that's not only excellent, but done on Christmas Day!",

    "text": "After a lot of drinking in the earlier part of the night, I was craving some seafood (King Crab legs to be exact).  So I left the hotel and started walking.    It was about 10:15 on a Friday night, so I knew my choices (that I knew of) were limited...    I saw about a block down a large sign that said \"Steaks and Seafood\".  I had heard of this place in ATL, and I quickly checked my Yelp app to make sure it was still open.  I had until 11PM.  I wanted something good to eat in my last night in Charlotte...  I know they probably thought I was an asshole for coming in drunk and late, but I promise, I made it worth their while :) .   Got seated immediately (told em to put me wherever was easiest, so I sat in the bar area- and I got to watch the Braves finish off their game :) ).  The decor was nice, but not what I expected!  It had tiled flooring, dark woods, and dim lights.  The place was nice, I just was expecting wood floors throughout (what the hell am I saying, I sat at the damn bar area).  Just ignore this paragraph.  I think my server was Sara(h), and she was very nice.  The one thing I noticed after scouring the menu- they DIDN'T have crab legs :(.  However, they had crab cakes.  So I got one for an \"app\".  I was so hungry, I ended up getting a 14oz strip and a lobster tail.  I also got some more beer.  The crab cake was moist, and I really enjoyed the iwouldliketocallitchutney that accompanied it.  That thing was gone in a matter of 2 bites.  Thankfully, the steak and lobster tail came out quickly after (which was surprising hence the size of the cut).  It came with some humungo asparagus too.  Unfortunately the damn pic I took of it was too blurry, so it didn't make the cut.  The steak itself wasn't bad (hell I ate the whole thing)- and was trimmed perfectly, but I wished it had a wee more seasoning.  The asparagus were alright, but they filled me up.  But I tell you what- that damn lobster tail was probably the best thing I had there- it almost completely made up for the fact they didn't have crab legs.  Thankfully, I didn't wear out my welcome, and they were cool with me ordering dessert- so I got the apple crisp thing.  It was damn good, but I wish it had some more ice cream (hell, I was buzzin and had a sweet tooth!).    This great experience only lasted 40 minutes (I got outta there right before the doors shut!)- which was awesome- usually a meal like this would last at least twice as long!  My total was around $96 (for 2 tall boys, app, surf n turf, and dessert) and let them know how much I appreciated them taking me in.  I will definitely have to come back here if I get the chance to- maybe they can procure some King Crab for me next time :) Cheers!",

By the time server bothered to check back she offered to cook the last two remaining bites of the steak. My date just didn't want to be rude and have me eat alone while his food was being refired. Instead of simply owning up to the mistake, the waitress rudely interrupted our dinner conversation by showing us she put in the ticket right, unfortunately this not only interrupts our dining experience, but it doesn't absolutely nothing about the issue. She was just more concerned about being tipped at this point.  When paying for the check, I show the server the Landry's card number and she just walks away with my phone without even saying anything which again was off putting. Despite all this I know folks need a working wage and we left her 20% tip, however I will not be back. There are far too many choices in Charlotte that offer great food and service.",

    "text": "Ok so this review is solely off the dessert as my friend and I were on a pretty indulgent spree of eating out and drinking wine at different places this weekend and this was our last stop for something sweet to eat and bubbles to wash it down with. First of all if you go get the apple walnut pie dessert and I'm pretty sure I'm off with the name of it but its the only one like it on the dessert menu. I don't care if you don't like nuts neither do I get it anyway its to die for. Honestly one of the best apple desserts I have had in a long time. We also got the creme brulee which is my all time favorite dessert and can be picky about them. I loved this one the hard sugar coating on top actually had to be cracked I have been to a lot of places where the sugar top is barely there at all. I also loved the fact that when I asked about what kind of berries came on it the bartender immediately asked me if I would like extra. Its like she was inside my brain as she stated that there can never be too many fresh berries on top of your creme brulee. I had a rose chandon split with the dessert and I'm pretty sure this is one of the best combinations Ive had in a long time. I wish I had caught the bartenders name she was super sweet and really attentive she was short with short bright blonde hair and was really amazing. The only thing that was even semi unpleasant about the visit was the really strange music that was playing and although my friend and I were having a blast it was really noticeable it was like some kind of weird techno dance music that didn't seem to fit the restaurants vibe at all. Normally this type of thing I never notice but this was unavoidable and kinda comical to be honest.   Parking is terrible just terrible as its uptown and super busy like all the time but I'm pretty sure I saw that they had valet but it could have been the place next door so don't quote me on that. All in all a great experience and will be back to try the regular food soon!",

I arrived with my friend who took part in the complimentary valet service (which is available until 10 p.m.) and was immediately seated at the table with the rest of our party.  For drinks, I ordered their agave 'rita cocktail which was delicious and not too overpowering on the alcohol. The waitress was very patient in answering all of our questions, making suggestions, and offering substitutions for our meals.   For my meal, I ordered the stuffed shrimp which came with white cheddar mash and roasted seasonal veggies. I do not have a negative thing to say about the meal: the shrimp were generously stuffed with lump crab meat, the cheddar mash was creamy, and the veggies still had a bit of a crunch to them.  For dessert, I ordered the creme brulee which had a nice crunchy top and creamy custard texture topped off with berries.  Overall, my first experience dining at M&S was delicious and look forward to future meals.",

    "text": "Bad. Just all around. Ate there a few weeks back.  Food quality was poor, and most items were cold or room temp at best.  Service was non existent.  We were never offered more drinks, plates were not cleared between courses, never asked how things were, water was empty most of the meal, entrees showed up 5 Minutes apart, one dessert never showed up.   We were a party of 14 and it was a decent size bill.  I said something to who I think was a manager and he basically told me it was \"restaurant week\" as an excuse. All I asked for was for him to not add the auto gratuity. When we received the bill, it was not on there.  We still left 15% which I personally think was overly generous but much les than I'd typically leave.  Unfortnslly, when the restaurant charged my card it didn't match what I signed for. I called, received a copy, and come to find out they made some adjustments to the bill but added another $20dollars to the tip.  After an email to the resturaunt (unanswered ) and three phone calls asking them to resolve it i gave up.   Lesson learned....never eat at this chain again.  And FYI if they read this, adding to the tip is stealing !",

The bar staff was great....friendly and accommodating to the people who were a bit under dressed for this type of place. The beer tap list is quite decent for being a chain restaurant with several local craft beer options including OMB and NoDa.    The bartenders explained this new bar appetizer menu that really had several tantalizing options. My friend ordered the buffalo shrimp which came with several shrimp, celery and carrot sticks and a scoop of coleslaw.  The shrimp was great and had a good kick to the sauce. The coleslaw was herby and quite tasty.  So maybe I'll be back sometime to try their other options but for a first time experience, I wish I could give this 3.75 stars. I think they are well above average but based on this experience alone, not quite worth the 4th star.",

    "text": "We hit up happy hour (M-F 3-7p) yesterday just to try it out, neither of us have been to McCormick and Schmicks and, I don't think we will be back either. The HH prices have almost doubled since I last looked them up, FYI. Drinks start at $6 and Food starts at $3   The hostess was very nice and explained HH was open to the bar area including the bar height tables, cool. We sit down and take a look at the menu. Our server was a little pushy when it came to taking out order and insisted I try the bruschetta ($3) with the mussels ($7) I ordered, after a while I just gave in, the guy had stamina. My boyfriend ordered the infamous burger ($5). We also got a couple of cabernet glasses ($6). The food got to the table within reasonable time. The bruschetta was fresh but had way too much mint in it, if you really want to put some herbs in there, stick to basil. Mint makes no sense, this is not a mojito. The balsamic vinegar the bruschetta came with was more on the sweet side. The burger we ordered looked good and was cooked nicely but was sadly very bland, some seasoning and flavored aioli would have made it enjoyable. Now, the mussels, I love mussels but the white wine sauce was too strong and was not able to mask the natural fishiness of the mussels. eh I just worked my way through it with the cheesy bread that accompanied the dish. Towards the middle of my dish is where I docked the most stars on this review. THEY GAVE ME A BAD MUSSEL, I immediately spat it into my napkin and waited for our server to let him know. He was very apologetic and sent out for a new mussel dish.   Skip to bill time, the server charged us for the second plate of mussels which I didn't order. Luckily, as we were about to sign, he rushed up to our table and told us he had to remove a mussel dish off the bill since it was a house mistake...good call, that would have made me a very upset little brown girl. All in all, the service was great but the food was just not good enough to make me want to come back.",

It was just ok, nothing good, nothing great, and definitely not worth the price point at all. Overall, the sushi grade ahi was disappointing.   My boyfriend ordered the salmon and he also said that he had had better at different restaurants across Charlotte. After tasting it, it was clear it was was frozen previously and just not a \"fresh\" piece of fish.   Overall, you can get a better fish meal at different restaurant across the city than here.

    "text": "While visiting Charlotte on a business trip, an old friend of mine who lives in the area wanted to meet up for dinner and catch up on old times.  We talked about a number of places to meet and and she suggested McCormick.  I agreed because I have always wanted to try out one and see if they are as good as I hear.  I expected it to be a bit on the pricy side (which it was) but for the price, it should be really good food (which is was not).    I arrived around 6:30 pm on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  The restaurant was not packed and was about half full.  The two greeters were busy talking to each other so I never got any hello, welcome, or acknowledgement that I walked in the door.  I met my friend at the bar and we both had a drink.  The bartenders were nice and one even complimented me on my mustache.  When I asked what bourbon they had, the younger bartender named a few but could not remember more than 3 or 4 of them.  I did see them all listed in the menu later on while ordering dinner and they had about 20 brands.   My friend had wine and I ordered a Manhattan.  They can't really mess up wine but my Manhattan was okay but was shaken, not stirred... Plus they used basic maraschino cherries... Yuck.   We finished our drinks, paid our bar bill and then were taken to a table for dinner.  I have to say our server was very nice and he was a delight.  After some good small talk, we decided to order another round of drinks.   We decided to only have entrees so our server took our order and said bread would be right out.  Now lucky for us, we were not in a rush... It took a bit for the cocktails to arrive (again, wine was wine and hard to mess up but my Manhattan was only about 2/3rds full... Did they spill some along the way?  It was not a full drink like I had sitting at the bar.  The bread finally made it to the table but that was a full 20 min after our server left.   Our food arrived  and I had the Hawaiian Swordfish with mashed potatoes and spinach.  All I can say was that everything looked dried out.  The Swordfish was overcooked and a bit dry.  The spinach and potatoes were just okay.  Not what I expected from the hype of this place.  I realized then just how much of a chain restaurant this place was.  My dinner partner had ordered a steak, mashed potatoes and a side of asparagus instead of the tomato which she does not like. They brought the tomatoes instead of the asparagus.  She told the server about the mistake and our server did bring out asparagus right away.   We did eat our meals and continued to catch up on our lives but decided that dessert would not be happening.   Atmosphere = 8  Service = 8  Food = 5  I was not impressed with the food here.  The place is decorated very nicely and except for the two greeters, everyone else was friendly and helpful.  I wish I could give them more stars but I have gotten better meals for less money.  I am not sure I can recommend this particular McCormick... Hopefully other locations are better.",

Requested to move tables within the first 5 minutes because we were sat directly a vent, that was blowing out cold air. Was greeted at our new table 12 minutes after we were sat, by a server named Trey. He took our drink orders and by the time he returned we were ready to order. We noticed he was also serving a table of 15-20 people, but they had already had food. We waited 40 minutes to be brought our bowls of chowder, which were actually room temperature.  As we tried to get his attention, we noticed him having long conversations with his other table and proceeding to take pictures with them. We were starving , so we went ahead and ate our soup, then waited another hour to be brought our steaks and surf & turf meals, which were cold. Overall, the service was terrible, and we will never consider this restaurant for a Christmas dinner considering the time it took to get our food.",

The waitress tried her best to serve a large group but was unsuccessful at providing a good customer service experience. I WILL NOT come back again, at least not in a big group",

I'm bad with names, so I don't remember our servers name but he was attentive, friendly and informative. Other servers would stop without hesitation if they thought we needed something. Unlike others have said, the service was friendly, attentive and timely. Overall great experience.",

    "text": "We have been to McCormicks in Minneapolis with a much better experience than we had tonight.  Service was incredibly slow.  Diners seated after my party received their meals long before ours arrived. Drink orders took 20 Minutes.   The food was good.  The bill included many items that were not ours and it took three attempts to get it correct.  The original bill was $135.00 more than it should have been.  Wow-won't come back here.  Very disappointed.",

    "text": "This place was way overpriced for the food you got.  Also,  they need to learn how to cook shrimp.  I got the McCormick Seafood Trio and both shrimp items were WAY over cooked.  For $31 I got 6 shrimp and a small salmon filet (maybe 4 oz) which was also overcooked, just not as bad as the shrimp.  The shrimp at this place were definitely not Bubba approved.  My wife got the New York strip and for $39 she got a 13 ounce strip (which tasted decent) and 3 asparagus spears.  All of this was paired with slow service. Go somewhere else.",

    "text": "I've been to this location twice with co-works, and I have to say the food is generally very good. Everything else in my experiences, however, has been pretty mediocre. I've tried the andouille shrimp pasta, which was excellent, and I have also had the stuffed flounder, which was good but not great. Both dishes were good quality but very small portions and definitely overpriced for what you get. I also have to point out that in my most recent visit the complementary bread was rock hard (literally able to hit it on a plate an not produce crumbs which my co-worker did). Aside from the small portions, I've also been pretty disappointed in the service. The food came out fairly slowly on both occasions, especially for business lunches, and the servers have certainly not wow'ed me in any way.",
