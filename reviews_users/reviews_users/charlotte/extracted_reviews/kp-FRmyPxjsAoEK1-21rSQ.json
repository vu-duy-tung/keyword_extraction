The rolls were tough and no butter came with it . We won't be back.  Very disappointed and went here due to the rating.   There are better Italian restaurants in town. Go to one of those instead.",

Wrong, worst so called Italian food we've ever had. Mushy under seasoned pasta, doughy undercooked garlic rolls, over cooked shrimp and gloppy tasteless Marsala sauce. The only positive note was the service and that we had a groupon so we didn't pay full price for this disappointment.",

The manacotti is really dissappointing.  I adore manacotti and was really sad it wasnt good, a friend had told me that it wasnt good here but I ordered it anyway- yuk. Riccios- if you hear this please revist this recipe and you could have a once a weeker in me.  Seriously- if you do change it send me a message and Ill yelp you again and spread the Riccios gospel.  BUT Im giving it 5 stars because they have excellent pizza- fish romano and DELIVERY!!!!!  Seriously Charlotte- WTF here, why does no one in this town deliver in the Southpark area??  So kudos to you for that.  Plus the delivery guy is great, really stands out!",

The marinara sauce tasted kinda strange, so it was just ok.  The garlic knots they serve you for appetizers are delicious as well.

    "text": "I moved to Charlotte from NY 3 months ago. I grew up on a block with 3 families who owned Italian restaurants. So I've been spoiled with good Italian food! This place is definitely compatible!   We walked in and who I believe was the owner greeted us. He told us to make ourselves comfortable at the bar while we waited for friends. My husband wished they had draft beer but they had beer so he was good. I do wish they had more craft beers but as long as they were supporting the locals I was happy. The house Pinot Grigio was great.   The dining room is small and tight. We sat close by another couple at first but when we asked to move they were more than accommodating! I'm a loud speaker so I didn't want to interrupt others.   The complimentary garlic knots were good. They would have been SO MUCH better if they were served with a side of olive oil! Our server was amazing. He explained the menu and offered suggestions to my very picky friend. I've been craving eggplant so I went with the eggplant parm. My husband got the chicken parm. Our friends got the baked ziti and the linguine carbonara.   My eggplant was excellent! It was thick sliced but not too thick. I'm picky with eggplant because some places don't take the water out of it before cooking and it gets watery. This was juicy but far from watery. It was perfect and the sauce was great. I mean... It wasn't MY sauce but it was pretty damn good. My husband wolfed down his chicken parm before I could even get a taste so I guess it was good! My friends liked their food and it looked great. The only thing that was a little ah was the carbonara didn't have pancetta it was bacon.   Overall, can't wait to go back and bring my mom when she comes to visit! We'll be back next Friday for pizza! So happy to find a place that felt like home :)",

Marinara sauce it's served with is great, too.   Garlic rolls - hot, perfect little garlic morsels. The taste is not overpowering as some garlic breads can be. Be careful not to fill up on these guys!  Fried mozzarella - not a showstopper but good enough. May have been a smidge overcooked as there was a slight burnt taste.  I had the penne puttanesca - yum! Spicy and so flavorful and fresh.   Husband had the fettuccine alfredo - creamy and coated The noodles perfectly. The Alfredo didn't separate and was perfectly seasoned.

The decor reminded me of a senior living center. Come to think of it the crowd did as well. But I'm thinking I've had plenty of good food at hole in the wall type places, but after looking around it just seemed like that keeping the place up was not a priority.  Was served relatively fast but overall it was poor. They were friendly but even while dealing with my table they seemed distracted and we're trying to do to many things. The service seemed consistent with my whole experience.   Typical southern Italian food. My food was below average at best and so was my daughters.  Maybe they have the best pizza in the city and I just didn't order the right thing.    I wasn't looking for anything fancy just something half way decent. Didn't find it here.",

    "text": "I have known for quite a while that Riccios was tucked away in the Touchstone shopping center  (along with Tuesday Morning and the Touchstone Yellow Rose) but haven't bothered going before now because I thought it was just another super casual pizza joint.   So, when we saw the recent Groupon deal, we decided to go and check it out.  Needless to say, we were suprised when we walked in the door last Friday night and found the place jam-packed with people.  It was standing room only! However, Ricky found a spot for us to have a seat on some barstools back by the kitchen while we waited .  We waited no more than 5 -10 minutes and then were taken to our table.  We decided to start with an order of calamari and garlic knots.  The calamari was breaded and cooked just right - not rubbery or chewy. The marinara sauce was fresh and tasty.  The garlic knots were seasoned to perfection and quite tasty.  Our server was very helpful in answering our questions about various menu items. It was a tough decision though because they had a nice selection of pastas, pizzas, and entree favs like chicken parm, chicken marsala, eggplant parm, etc.  I was really torn between the vegetable lasagna and the Tortolloni Bellagio.  I ended up with the tortelloni which was served in a cream sauce with sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic, and chicken (around $15).  It was very good, but rather rich, so next time I think I'll check out the veggie lasagna or one of the pizzas.  (I saw several other tables with pizzas that looked really good.)   Other people in my party ordered veal marsala (around $18), chicken parm (around $16), and chicken francaise (around $16).  I thought the chicken parm & chicken francaise (similar to chicken piccata) both looked good. Since I don't eat veal, I thought that dish looked icky. ;-)    One of our friends had a birthday so we ordered a dessert to share and of course, had to go with the tiramisu. It was good - perfect texture and flavor.   Overall, I was pleasantly suprised about our entire experience here. The food was good, the service was excellent, and the atmosphere was friendly & comfy.  We ended up spending a little more than expected we would (the bill came to around $100 before tip for 4 entrees, 1 appetizer, 1 dessert, and 3 beers) but the place was still reasonably priced.  We are definitely looking forward to our next visit.  Ricky came by to chat with us and we found out this is the same Riccios that was originally in Myers Park (started by Ricky's family) and then was over at Strawberry Hill for a while.  Long time Charlotteans may remember Riccios from one of the previous locations.  In any case, we hope they stay in this location for a long, long time!    Oh, and as a bonus, we found out they deliver to our neighborhood, so SCORE for those nights when we're too lazy to cook or go out!",

It has an odd location that threw me off a bit, but we were so glad we still went in. Their garlic rolls are so soft, fresh and have the perfect amount of garlic. I had the cheese ravioli with butter sauce, my mom had the tortelloni bellagio, my dad had manicotti & cousin had spaghetti. Now how one would choose which of those dishes was the best would be impossible, because they were all so delicious I literally made myself sick eating so much! We went back again this weekend and everything was just as delicious. There was a shorter, blonde woman who seemed to be the manager. She was so sweet and welcoming both times and made sure everyone was taken care of with a smile. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the Charlotte area in search for authentic Italian food with a side of amazing service! Can't wait to go back!!",

However, the waitress communication with us when she did take our order was a bit choppy. When she did give us attention it was very minimal and I felt a bit unsatisfied with the experience.   Calamari was solid along with the pizza we ordered.

It's casual and friendly, however the food is not as one would get in Italy.  The Entres of Chicken Francais and Veal Piccata were fine, nothing extraordinary, but good.  However there is only a too large portion of store-bought pasta with undistinguished tomato sauce to accompany the meat.  Usually at $21 one has a veg on the same plate that is included in the entre price.  It's a pleasant restaurant and hidden away as it is, one hopes for a hidden gem, but it doesn't fall into that category.  We've never had their pizza; it's possible that is the better choice.",

I actually do prefer mine with somewhat of a light butter on them (not soaking in butter or oil, just a little). Penne Elizabeth didn't have much flavor and I can't even remember the name of the 2nd dish we ordered which tells you how great it was. I did like the ceasar dressing. Would like to give this place another try just because of all the great reviews. Food did take awhile to receive and the place was packed on a Sunday evening so heads up during football season.",

It was off our radar since it's farther from our place, but our neighbors ordered and said they'll still deliver to us even though we're slightly outside their delivery radius.    Some of the best pizza I've had in ages.  We ordered my guilty pleasure (usually we try to go with veggies to keep it *somewhat* healthy....) Large pepperoni + black olives w/ a side salad with Ranch.  How good your ranch dressing is sort of a benchmark in my book.  Fresh restaurant made ranch tells me a lot about the restaurant.  Outstanding ranch!  Definitely not from a bottle...  Pizza was fantastic.  Great dough, great sauce, great ratio of sauce, cheese and toppings...  All around fabulous pizza!  I've been searching for Riccios for a LONG time!  Yay for having found our go-to pizza delivery!  Looking forward to trying the Italian delicacies on the menu.  I am sure it's all great...",

I give them a solid 4 stars because while the food is great it's not really 5 stars great.

I didn't return anything as I was starving so I just ate. I think I will try it again just to see if it was an off night. My dinner partners all said the same just ok.

It was not crowded for a Wednesday night but while we were there four different pickup orders were processed so I see that it is a local favorite.  We had the Stracciatella Romana soup which is fancy Italian for delicious broth based soup with spinach, romano and I swear I saw some chives in there.  It was 4 bucks and completely delicious making me wish I hadn't insisted we share.    For dinner, I had the Tortolloni Bellagio - I dont like tortellini at all but our super waitress recommended it so I said 'Sure'!  When it comes out you just have to be ok with the fact that you will weigh ten pounds more just looking at it.  It was heavy cream sauce with chicken and mushrooms  - delicious.  My boyfriend got the Chicken Parm which comes with a side of pasta.  I wish I had gotten that - the chicken breast was the size of his plate and the marinara was perfection.    During the meal they also bring you these ridiculously mouth-watering 'garlic knots' or 'garlic rolls' which are hot out of the oven.  That is probably why I could only eat three bites of my heavy meal and claim I was full.  We were out of there for around 30 bucks and it was worth every penny since we will have a ton of leftovers for tonight!!  I am definitely going back to try their famous pizza too!!  :-)",

Showed up about pm and we were the only ones in teh place, but within 15 moins it started to fill up fairly quickly. Wife ordered teh Lasanga and did not enjoy it. The lasanga noodles were thick and under cooked (actaully looked to be 3  noodles stuck together) and was pretty much tasteless. She only could eat 3-4 bites before giving up. I ordered the Spaghetti and meatballs becuase I couldn't stomach paying $21 for chicken parm.  There was something I didn't like and couldn't describe about the spaghetti sauce. Not sure if it was bad or just a sauce I didn't care for. Needed some more sweetness - very thick and dry. Meat balls were ok, but the ones at Hawthornes are miles better. My son eneded up with the kds chicken tenders which were very greasy and thin -- looking more like fried calimari.  Service was lack luster as well - our server didn't seem particularly interested in being there and was handling the entire dining room so was hard to get her attention at times. All in all it was all just \"meh\". Not an Italian place to our liking and we probaby won't be back.",

So I searched yelp for a local restaurant that was reasonable and found Riccio's. We went on a Friday nite the wait was under 10 min.  The food and service was great. Our waitress was extremely pleasant and food came in a timely manner. We all had the veal parmigiana.  We also had house salad and fried mozzarella. We will definitely be going back. I highly recommend this restaurant for good home style food.",

    "text": "Hidden gem: smashed between two gyms and a massive structure under construction, I never would have though the best pizza in Charlotte would be here. I have lived in Charlotte for 5 months and am from the Northeast. I have tried all kinds of pizza places and they have all failed. This Charlottean obsession with trying to make \"New York style\" pizza has to stop. No- your pizza does not taste good and it is certainly not New York style. I have searched high and low to find normal pizza in Charlotte, but it cannot be found. It's as though restaurants have forgotten how to make normal, regular pizza. It is so sad because Charlotte fails with food in so many other areas...  Anyway, back to Riccio's. Pizza was great. Ok, it was still thin crust, semi wanna be NY pizza, but maybe not. It was authentically homemade. The cheese- great. The crust- delicious. The toppings- quality. Not too greasy at all, but not dry and plain. We had mushroom and pepperoni- sticking to ordinary things. Flavor was great.  Pasta was delicious also.  If I were staying in Charlotte, I would have found my pizza joint. Riccio's, you impress me. Thank you.",

It was so weird because that is my kids favorite food. I tried the sauce and it tasted like can tomato paste with literally no flavor!  I ordered a clam dish and it was unsalted, watery, and super seafood taste as if the clam was about to spoil. The only food my family liked is lasagna but then again my teenagers have no taste of good quality food.  I'm giving one star for only the service. The server was friendly and took care of us. I will never come again and shocked that everyone gave this place high reviews.",

I'll update the review when we actually go to the restaurant for a dine-in experience, but I feel the quality of the food was well represented from our pick up order.  We got an order of Garlic Knots (half dozen, but there were more than 6... thanks Riccios! ), I got a Penne dish, and the lady got a cheese pizza.  The garlic knots were fantastic. This is what all italian places should aspire to be like. Doughy, good size, and had an awesome garlic flavor.  The penne with chicken and vegetables was off the chain, and the pizza was wonderful as well. Can't wait to return and try other things!",

    "text": "Riccio's was on my bucket list for a while and with a recent groupon I finally made my way to try the place with a friend.  My friend, Julia M, said they had expanded the place since her last visit and added a bar to the left and a few bar tables.  Even with the expansion, the restaurant is not that big but as we found out on a Thursday night, they certainly get busy.  This is a little gem.  The staff is really friendly here.  They are eager to give you their recommendations.  They will sit with you as they take your order and the owner himself will come out and talk to you to make sure you are enjoying your food.   For dinner, I ordered a glass of Chianti, the lasaga  and a side salad.   The salad was beautifully presented and the lasagna was a huge portion that could easily feed 3 people.  The lasagna was very meaty and smothered with sauce.  It was the best lasagna I've had recently.    This is what you expect from the locally owned places that have been here for years and have a large local following.  There's only a few problems I see with this place. 1--The shopping center needs a bigger anchor than Tuesday Morning so the restaurant gets more foot traffic.  There used to be a Food Lion here but it closed a few years ago.  2--The booths are kind of uncomfortable if you are a tall person.  The chair to table ration is a bit off and you feel the table should be a bit higher.  3--They should be open for lunch.  I would come more often then!",

The owner/manager (?) was present and walking around chatting with guests (an important touch you often don't see anymore). The food came out very quickly and was delicious.   The only low point was the ceasar salad. The lettuce was not terribly crisp, the dressing not very tangy and the croutons were clearly bagged.

In all fairness, my husband and sister-in-law both had pretty good food, but my food was terrible, and the owner was abrupt and rude to the point of chasing us down in the parking lot after we left, to tell me I had a bad meal because I wasn't clear about what I wanted to eat.

She is truly super, accommodating and eager for everyone to have a great meal and experience.  First an order of four garlic rolls, which could be a meal alone.  Soft, chewy, flavorful and delicious.  Make sure you give them a shot.  Their pizza, our first ordered there, was great.  It was an artichoke, tomato, onion and garlic combo, a suggestion on their menu, and it was thin crust.  What flavor and the dough was wonderfully yeasty and pleasantly chewy.  No wonder there are so many pizzas to-go.  I had an egg-battered lemony snapper with a side of linguine.  To me, not so good, as it was too buttery.  Thought the sauce could have done with more white wine.  I was not paying attention when Tonya asked, \"marinara?\"   I said OK and when the nice sized pasta portion arrived it was mounded with their rich marinara.  Problem was that I really don't care for marinara so just picked at it.  Come time to clear the table, Tonya asked about the pasta.   I came clean and mentioned as I did above and she replied that I should have sent the pasta back so that they could top the linguini with the lemon/white wine/butter sauce.  And that she would have had them put more wine in the sauce.  A great example as to how a good wait person can adjust your meal to your satisfaction.  My wife thinks that I was being too friendly with the waitress.  Maybe...",

There is butcher paper and crayons on the tables so... family restaurant? Confusing.  Beer and wine selection was very small and very unimpressive.   Ordered the linguine and white clam sauce and the chicken romano...  Rolls were undercooked.  The linguine was fine - canned clams and a little watery but the flavor was there... Would have done well with more parsley and a squeeze of lemon.  The chicken was good... Canned crab and three spears of over-cooked asparagus on top of a large, lightly breaded piece of chicken on top of a pile of pasta in a thick cream sauce. Again, could use some brightness in flavor and color...   Service was friendly and efficient.  I may come back and try the pizza but all in all it was disappointing versus the hype.",

The lasagna and sausage and pepper sandwich are our favorites! The only bad thing is that they don't have the vodka sauce anymore, that was our favorite by far. :( If anyone from Riccio's reads this, can I have that recipe please?! :) Or can you put it back on the menu?! :)",

    "text": "We had a gift certificate to the restaurant so we had dinner there. The waitress was somewhat cool and became a little more friendly as dinner progressed. For example we asked what kind  of dressings for the salad and she curtly said look there and pointed on the menu. Most waitress I know would tell their customers what's avaialble. So, garlic knots were brought to the table  but were doughy like they were underbaked although good garlic flavor. The house salad was nice and a good portion..My chicken Francaise was tender, no  detected seasoning except very lemony and almost too acidic to the tongue. My dining mates spaghetti and meatballs tasty but nothing memorable. Although the meat sauce was tasty, the meatballs (2) were very soft in texture and we both agreed we tasted better elsewhere. The atmosphere was comfortable, prices reasonable, food came out hot and plated nicely. The menu with lots of choices for pizzas, pasta specialties, chicken, fish and veal entrees and desserts such as tiramisu and cannoli. As we left we noticed the specialty board, which our waitress did not inform us about. Our first dining experience there and not sure we would return. I read other Yelp reviews before coming and it seems inconsistencies in quality of food as well as waitress service.",

I normally take the time to write positive reviews on Yelp because you only hear the bad, but this was so disappointing.   The meatballs looked as if they were taken out of the freezer and defrosted; so dense. I took one bite and the smell was just foul.  The veal parmigiana looked like it was made days ago and reheated and the garlic rolls were also dense and dry.  We found the whole situation so entertaining, we made a band out of our food and utensils. Immature, I know but it gave us a good laugh.   On a positive note, the spaghetti was good and ended up being my dinner.   Could have been an off night but it was enough to make me never want to go back.",

    "text": "I convinced the Beau to try this restaurant based on the Yelp reviews, as he's pretty particular about his Italian food, being 2nd generation Italian and everything.     The restaurant is a little difficult to find, as its tucked away between two gyms, its easiest to enter address into the GPS.    When I get inside, I tell the hostess that Im there to pick up my takeout order and she sent me to the back counter.  As we are waiting for them to grab our food, I check into Yelp and a 20% coupon pops up, sweet! I showed it to the gentleman ringing me up and he tells me he doesn't know how to enter a discount code.  He checks with four (4!) employees and none of them know how to enter a discount coupon. They tell me that I have to wait for the manager but dont know where she is.  The teenage staff all giggle nervously at each other as they try to find their manager.  I waited for about 8-10 minutes and she finally shows up.  I show her the Yelp coupon and she tells me that its only good for dine in, I point out that the coupon doesn't state that but she hands me back my phone and proceeds to walk away.  This time, I ask if if I can at least pay for for my food since I've been waiting for ten minutes.  She calls another employee over and has them ring me up.  I walk out of the restaurant feeling as though I did something wrong.  Not very good customer service at all.  Surely didn't feel welcomed.   The food ---We get home  and have our dinner.  It was only ok, the sauce on my chicken parm tasted different, cant quite place what it lacked. The Beau stated that he wouldn't order that same plate again.   The garlic knots though, baked perfectly with great flavor!  However, the Food was definitely not worth the $19 for Chicken Parm and $21 for Veal Parm, layered in with bad customer service. We dont be back, unfortunately.  So sad because I really wanted to like everything about this place.",

The place is cozy and cute, lots of tables are packed into a small location in a strip mall, but this place is definitely a hidden gem. We called ahead and asked what the wait time was like and the hostess said there was no wait. We arrived 20 minutes later, and had to wait 30 minutes for a table. The service was okay. It took a long time to originally be greeted by a waitress (more than 10 minutes) and our food took a long time. But our poor waitress was so incredibly busy, literally running so I didn't complain. Other than the short staffing, I can't even take away a star because seriously this food is amazing. I got the carbonara and my husband got a pepperoni pizza. Just perfection.",

    "text": "This popular little Italian joint is a rarity, a family owned and operated restaurant in south Charlotte. It has anchored its hard-to-find shopping center, Touchstone Village, for at least the past 25 years after being started as a family business in 1962.  After a mediocre dinner nine months ago, my wife and I opted to give it another shot for a Friday night dinner. Its reputation alone and do-it-all, ever-present owner Ricky warranted such, and in all fairness, was overdue. Dinner is your only choice for dining here now as they no longer serve lunch. Chicken, fish and seafood entrees run $18-22. A conspicuously older clientele, many of whom were regulars, didn't seem to mind however as the place was again packed. As usual, Ricky tirelessly and cheerfully doted on diners between seating guests.  We ordered one of their specialties, the Chicken Parm at $21 and it was moist, delicious and plentiful. In fact it was  even better than our last visit, however the Chicken & Veggies with Penne was very dry due to the fact that the chicken was diced into small cubes which tend to dry out during cooking. We replaced it with the Vodka Pasta at $14 and it was okay but nothing special. We both got side salads at $5.50 each which are accompanied by garlic knots. Both were pretty good.  Our main gripe last visit was the horrible service provided by our server. This visit it was greatly improved in spite of the fact that we had the same server.  Overall, I feel it definitely earned an upgrade from 3 stars to 4. I will be back again but will stick to the chicken or veal parm or pizza.",

The garlic knots weren't bad but not as soft as I was expecting based on others reviews but the marinara they brought us to dip them in made up for it.  Our plates were every bit worth the price attached to them.  Two large meals an appetizer and two bottled beers $40 and some change.  Not bad.  I wish I didn't live 4 hours away, it would definitely become a regular place to visit.",

We waited at the unmanned bar (the hostess told us that it's bc they don't have a full liquor license yet- just beer/wine).  It was ready fairly quickly, maybe ten minutes.  Get home, open the bag, and wow, everything looks great!  The lasagna is huge (i had thought it was kind of pricey until I saw how much food!) and smells amazing.  It had a classic yet unique taste- good quality ingredients.  Eggplant parm was good too.  The little garlic knots were tasty too.  Everything was hot and fresh.  We had ordered the garlic pizza bread thing since we didn't know about the garlic knots.  No need for that bc we were stuffed!  Thanks Riccio's for great food and quick enough takeout.  We'll be back as we're right around the corner.",

Yum, two large pieces of fish in a delicious sauce...took half home.  Barbecue chicken pizza was yummy...nice crust, tangy sauce...took half home.  Manicotti & Lasagna, hot, baked, and tasty...took more than half home. Obviously serving sizes are very generous. My favorite was the garlic knots.  Yeasty, warm and delicious.

The garlic knots were very close to being burnt on top, but were raw in the middle.. which likely means they were FROZEN and placed in the oven to bake.. We attempted to finish cooking them ourselves, but in the end we just threw them away. The pizza crust was flavorless and seemed generic.. reminded me of school pizza but with better toppings. The prices for this place match local pizzerias such as mellow mushroom, fuel and tony's in Ballantyne - however the quality and flavor does NOT.  I felt like I completely wasted my money.",

I ordered the Pasta Pomodoro and truly the BEST pasta I've ever had in a restaurant. I grew up in Chicago and in an Italian family and community and it's saying a lot. I'm very particular about my pasta and this was amazing. My husband had the Baked Ziti and our son went for the Chicken Parmesan. Their entrees were also good and large enough portions to take home leftovers for all. If you're looking for that truly authentic, tucked away, family Italian Restaurant, look no further. If you're a chain restaurant, Olive Garden type of person, you won't find that stuff here. Would give more stars if I could.",

Enter Riccio's.   It may be a little hard to locate in the corner of the shopping center off of Baybrook, but once you find it, it's easy to tell it's a gem.   A quaint interior with tables and booths and plenty of smiling faces. My wife and I stumbled in to pick up a pizza and garlic knots. The service was so fast! Ready in less than 15 minutes!  Let me take this opportunity to blow your mind. Eggplant Parmesan pizza. Yes. Commence drooling. Fried eggplant, marinara and gratuitous amounts of mozz on a pizza. Holy cow. Amazing. Chewy eggplant with a light layer of seasoned breading. The garlic knots were the best I've had to date. Not coated in grease like so many other places. Dusted with garlic powder and finishes with a welcoming chew. The dough is wonderful. Great for sopping up extra marinara!  So happy to have finally visited Riccio's! Can't wait to head back to our new little neighborhood pizza place!",

    "text": "This is old school Italian.  We've lived in Charlotte 8 years,10 minutes from this place but always passed by it. Not today, was in the mood for some traditional Italian. So glad we are here.   We got the veal Marsala and pasta with vegetables in garlic and oil and everything was hot, presented well, and flavorful. We felt like we back in New York eating at a local joint that has been there for decades and with good reason. The food was just delicious. And or server could not have been nicer.  Don't let the outside fool you. Try this place, it's that good",

    "text": "Riccio's has been a tradition for my husband and I for as long as we have been together (almost 10 years). When Touchstone Village used to have a Food Lion in it, and a video store, he lived in the neighborhood behind it, and would walk from his house. Cue his current best friend that moved in 2 doors down when he was 7 and they would ride their bikes up there every weekend.   Needless to say, our group of 4 is recognized when we come in. I know the original two waitresses have literally watched my husband and his friend grow up, and consistently order the same thing (garlic knots, house salads, and pizza).   Even now we still order the same garlic knots, salad, and pizza, albeit our group is a bit larger. The food has never disappointed. The salads are always \"the best house salads\" ever, and the pizza is always fresh from the oven in less than 15 minutes even with a packed house.   Although with recent renovations, the place has grown, and had a face lift this is still the family restaurant we have known and loved for years. You are always greeted with a smile, the owner will always be there and converse with every table, and you will always leave full and satisfied.",

Should be able to share with at least two people. It was generously loaded with goodies and everything was so fresh. My wife got the house salad and was quite content.  1/2 a pizza to eat later tonight and tomorrow. I simply love left over pizza!",

    "text": "The place is somewhat hidden inside a village. It seems like it is more of a family restaurant.  Garlic bread was served and it was salty and the garlic flavoring was overpowering.   Calamari for apettizer was not even enticing. Bland and the marinara dip was lacking in flavor, too.   And came the entree. I made a mistake of ordering the shrimp marinara because it was the same sauce that came with the calamari. But how could i have known, we order the apettizer the same time with the entree. It was lacking that fresh italian herb and spices flavor. Although it was sprinkled with dried parsley and oregano on top. And it came with a ton of pasta! The chicken marsala was the only thing that tasted nice.   I was disappointed, to say the least. It was out-of-the-freezer and out-of-the-can taste. I might as well reheat my Ragu.",

    "text": "So this little place...  A friend and I had dinner here on 2/2/14. He had been before, I had not. Apparently they expanded the restaurant which I think was a smart move. I noticed they had a small bar as well...not sure if this was because they now had the space but good for them! As soon as we walked in we were acknowledged, greeted and seated quickly. Immediately thereafter our drink order was taken and things only got better!   The friendly server, Gabriella was pleasantly eager to take our order. We ordered salads, lasagna and garlic rolls. I ordered veggie lasagna. The salads were delicious. Just the right size. The lasagna was also very good. I'd never tried vegetable lasagna so I can't really compare, but the noodles were right, the sauce was right and yummy yum. Again, a great portion for the price. The atmosphere was very family oriented and everyone seemed very pleased.  Orders were flying out of the kitchen, the staff were managing it very well and seemed to work well together. The owner, Mr. Riccio working right along with everyone, came across like a nice guy and someone who valued every customer that graced his entrance. A great place for a cozy Italian dinner. Great job Mr. Riccio, I'll be back!",

The place is locked up.  There's some sign that says they open at 5 pm.    I email Groupon & they say the owners will call in the next two days.  They don't.  I get a refund.  I think livingsocial or similar had a deal afterwards & they at least listed the hours.  I think they are closed on weekends......so make sure you call ahead with their odd days & hours of operation.  And then these businesses wonder why they are eventually closed 7 days a week.",

The sauce was a little too sweet for my taste.My wife and I are both Italian and have eaten Italian food all over Charlotte and in Italy. The big surprise was the cost. For 3 people, one having the nightly special, one having pasta and the other having chicken, one appetizer and no alcohol was over $70! You don't even get a side salad with the dinner at that price! Very disappointed and won't be going back.....",

The food doesn't wow me, but it is a great place to grab something to eat moderately priced.  We had pizza, two good things to mention, it is thin crust and they aren't heavy on the toppings.  It is a very balanced pizza.   I ordered a glass of wine, it was just bad all together, the glass had an odor, the wine tasted horrible, so I asked the waitress to get me another glass of something different.  The second one wasn't any better.   I think I will stick to ordering by the bottle or drinking beer.  Other than that, we had a fun evening.  Service is always tops.",

    "text": "Hell, I'll go ahead and give Riccio's five stars, even though we had to wait awhile for our food! Read on to find out why.  Visited Riccio's this past Friday night. Arrived at 6:45 and were seated by 7. Ordered 2 pasta dishes, lasagne and manicotti, as well as some garlic knots. Prices seemed very good. Restaurant ambiance was nice. Wait staff was quite friendly.  The only issue was that our food took roughly 45 minutes to come out.  In that time though, our waitress took care of us. She dropped another 6 garlic knots off at our table, when she saw things were going long. We ordered another round of beers just before our food came. We'd been hoping to just have one beer with dinner but when you're waiting for 45 minutes, you get thirsty.  Our food finally did come, and I went from peeved to purely thrilled. The tomato sauce is different from anything I've ever tasted and the cheese on the top of the manicotti was crisped in such a way that it was nearly a light crust. I ate every single bite, even though I had eaten far too many garlic knots before it arrived. My meal was unreal. Was it \"Italian Authentic\"? I don't know. I've been to Italy three times and have never had manicotti that tasted this delicious so maybe it's not \"authentic\" but it's what I loved. That's all that mattered.  When we got our check I was kind of surprised at the cost. Surprised in that it was less than I had expected. Not only had our waitress comped our second round of garlic knots, she also comped our second round of beers because she had to wait longer than usual.  It's unusual you find a \"long standing tradition\" kind of place that's \"family run\" but is also this friendly and this generous. Riccio's is all of that, and to top it off the food is phenomenal - easily the best in Charlotte. The waitress explained that our long wait was an aberration due to a whole flurry of pizzas that took up the oven right before we ordered. I don't think it's a common problem, and I can't complain after all they did for us. We will be back.",

    "text": "I do love Riccio's.  Back when we lived across the street (literally) from this little gem, we would walk over and pick up pizzas on the regular. Brought my dad when he visited from out of town. It's super small, run by friendly folks, and generally a wonderful hole in the wall location to grab a pizza. (It's in a strip mall next to Tuesday Morning and various other shops...oh, and the ever divey Touchstone Rose bar.)  My favorite item on the menu is the eggplant parmesan pizza. Sounds like a disaster waiting to happen, but it's sheer perfection. Gooey cheese coupled with battered, thin-sliced eggplant and red sauce. When I'm hungry, it's what I crave. Can't stop eating...and a large pizza is gone in no time when split between the Mr and me.  I really appreciate that these guys put as much love into a take-away pizza as they do if you're dining in-house. The garlic knots are also winners.  I've never had a bad experience with Riccio's. So if you're in south Charlotte and looking for something to delight and surprise you with pizza goodness, look no further than Riccio's.",

My friends mostly got the special as well, except one person got a greek pizza.  It looked really good.

Their calamari is awesome...and so is the marinara it is served with. The portions are quite big so we had plenty to take home. The knots and calamari is enough for  a quick/inexpensive meal for two. The atmosphere is nice enough for a date, but casual/relaxed enough to pop in with the entire family.   I wish it was a little closer to my house but when I am in the area I will definitely come back!",
