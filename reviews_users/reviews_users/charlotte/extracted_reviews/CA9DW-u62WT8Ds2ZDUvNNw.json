GRANTED, the only complaint I have (and it seems to be quite common to all locations), is that everything looks and feels sticky. I wish someone can just scrub the heck out of the tables and floors and chairs.   We went to Chili's mainly because they have a Cheap Bites menu that's served all day on Sundays (and we sat at the bar area because I dont' know if this is only for bar patrons). They are also avaliable during the week as \"happy hour\" deal and \"late night\" after 9pm. $4.99 and you get pretty much a full size order. My favorite item on the $4.99 menu is Santa Fe Chicken Salad. The portion is insane, plenty to share. I asked for honey-lime dressing instead of ranch.  While I'm not a big chain diner, I do find Chili's to have good food for great price. $25 to feed 4 people is a good deal!",

    "text": "I want to establish something before I review my dining experience here:  It doesn't matter how hard I slam this place.  No one that works there can do ANYTHING about it.  If you stocked Chili's with the greatest waitstaff, the greatest chefs, the greatest managers, the greatest dishwashers, et cetera, NONE of them could change the fact that the food is terrible.  So, people of Chilis:  I salute your service.  I am positive that you do your best, every day, to squeeze this fat sloppy pig into that prom dress.  I appreciate everything you tried to do, and I tipped you well.  This being said...  How can I describe my experience here?  Friendly staff: helpful, quick, efficient, wonderful people, all of them.  Really.  The food?  Well.  First off.  Their chips and salsa is bad.  If I bought the least appealing salsa at the grocery-store, and the least appealing chips off the shelf, and put them into a wax-paper lined bowl, it would be very similar to this \"dish\".    Now.  Ask yourself:  if the chips and salsa are bad...  how bad can the.,..  Fried shrimp be?  Pretty bad.  It comes with fries and cole slaw.  The fries?  The fries are fries.  Eh.   The cole slaw?  Pretty bad.  All together, it looked like a plate of \"brown\" and a ramekin of shredded white, purple, and orange credit cards.   The shrimp tasted like... nothing.  Like chewy nothing and fried batter that squished when you chewed it.  The cole slaw?  Like crunchy nothing and mayonnaise.    Even the cocktail sauce was bad.  Do I deserve this?  I mean...  shrimp from Chilis?  Even though the Atlantic Ocean is 4 hours due east, I bet that stuff came from some processing center in Texas.  It was DOA weeks ago when it was bagged, packed into boxes and flash-frozen.  All together...  I think it was about $20.00 because the drinks are jacked up.  Two sodas=like 5 bucks, right?  Off about 3 cents worth of carbonated water and flavored syrup.  They always make money on the drinks...  For the price, the food was awful.  Truly awful.  Burgers that went to other tables LOOKED eatable, but still...  I can't help but keep thinking...  if the chips and salsa is bad...  what else is bad?",

My roommate got a burger and I got some tacos. The tacos were a new item on the menu. They had shrimp, pork, and chicken. You also had the option to mix and match. I went with two shrimp and a pork. The tacos were decent. The shrimp were called \"spicy shrimp\" but there was only one bite that I had that was spicy. Not sure what was in that mouthful but it was definitely spicy!! The food was decent but it felt like it was on the pricier side for a chain restaurant.   The new tablet on your table system is pretty cool. You can order a round of drinks right from your table without having to wait for your server to come back. They have tons of free games to play with your friends or keep the kiddos entertained. AND  you can pay your bill right at the table. You can even split it however many ways you want to right at the table. It's pretty awesome.",

I still had to wait 10 minutes in the parking lot for my food to be brought out to my car. My food was lukewarm at best. I went inside and asked for the tip to be refunded to my credit card. The manager print me a receipt saying he reversed the entire order but did not reverse it for the full amount. He left out the tip. When I questioned this he offered me a half baked explanation and \"promised\" me it would come off my card correctly.

    "text": "That review about bad management is right on. We ate here 4 months ago and the server was a sweetie. Came back today with the same party of 8. There were several open tables to the right but most were booths that could not be moved.  To the left were plenty of tables that could be moved together. Hostess said she needed to see if manager would let us sit there because it was a closed section and they did not have 2 tables in the other section they could put together for us. She came back 5 minutes later and said manager would not open that section for us to eat together. I asked, \"so are you saying you want us to go somewhere else to eat?\" Her response,was something to the effect that perhaps a big booth Might open up in 20 minutes (but no real eagerness to commit to that either).   Sent hubby to Cheddars next door and even though they were much busier than chili's that pulled 2 tables together in no time.  As I sat in chili's waiting for an update, I watching several others people come in and get seated immediately. The problem was not they were too busy, it was that they did not want to put seats together in the closed section. They expected us to wait for their convenience.   Two things: managers that don't want to accommodate people should come tell them--not send the message through a high schooler.   If you don't want to seat people quickly don't build a building with all those seats to the left. Yes, I understand it is an inconvenience for staff if customers  are spread out;  but 1) you are in a customer service business, and 2) servers are not really needed to take orders with the table side kiosk.   I took my money next door and will Never return again.  Suggest you do the same.",

Nothing was really open after the game (because obviously things close early on christmas eve), and this was out first time in charlotte, so we decided to go to this chilli's before heading to our hotel. IT WAS HORRIBLE. We waited about 30 minutes to be seated. Then we waited another 20 minutes before a server even came to get our drink orders and had we known the area we wouldve just left from the go. He claimed he overlooked us somehow, however he bumped into my chair several times. Anyway, this turned out to be the worst waiter we've EVER had anywhere. He didn't refill our drinks at all, gave us no napkins, nothing. The only thing he did was take our orders. When the food came it was horrible and burned. We didn't even eat and be honest we shouldn't have paid at all. Save yourself the trouble of coming to this shithole.",

My sister and I ordered 2 different salads (buffalo chicken salad and quesadilla explosion salad).  The lettuce was old, wilted, and bad. It was the worst salad ever!! My dad ordered the old timer's burger and there was almost no burger. We had 7 people in our party and each menu selection was awful!!

It's a chain restaurant, so I can't say much about the uniqueness of the restaurant. I do say if you do come here, order the burgers.

We waited another 15 to have our orders to be taken, and waited around another 20ish for the food to arrive (WHICH WAS NORMAL AND FINE FOR 2 STEAK DINNERS). we still hadn't received our drinks or silverware, and waited another 10 for both. i spoke to management about the lengthy wait and lack of service, requested another beer and they proceeded to get my request wrong. i was facing the kitchen, and witnessed the manager speak to the young lady and gesture towards our table; she proceeded to not only catch a attitude, but it was NOTICED BY STAFF AND CUSTOMERS, and the staff laughed at it! What?! this is customer service! you don't get to make a customer wait repeatedly for EASY things and then catch a attitude when corrected for the amusement of your coworkers! our food was cold when served to us and our broccoli was under cooked, the steak cooked incorrect. I didn't speak on the food because by this time i was fed up. I hate sending food back, and judging from the tacky response from the wait staff, i didn't trust it.  Don't go here; unless you want to wait 1 hour for your silver ware and soda, or laughed at when you request better service.",

My excitement was killed by the time we were done. Our server was very absent minded. She kept forgetting to bring certain things to the table. Then I ordered fried pickles and received chips and salsa instead. She told us to keep them while she went to get our pickles. By this time the pickles and fajitas are coming out at the same time. The tortillas that they gave my husband and me were wrapped in aluminum foil and looked like someone had squeezed them to death. We opened the foil and couldn't even pull them apart. This tells me that they had been sitting for a while. I'm not sure how when I received my food after everyone else at the table. I asked for replacements and that wasn't much better. Then when it was time to check out, she got my sister's order wrong and rung her card up twice. This server seemed to be having and bad night so I tried not to let it get to me, but I was not pleased. My food was not that good and very disappointing. I won't be visiting this Chili's again... ever.",

    "text": "If I could give my visit last night a zero I would. First of all the context. I am the father of three teenagers and we don't always have the money to go on special outings, etc. We happened to have some extra money and the kids wanted to go out for dinner just with me, so it was a special occasion for all of us. My kids said that Chili's was where they wanted to go. Where do I begin, our visit was like we were in the Twilight Zone. First, we were told the wait for a table would be 15 minutes (turned out to be 30). Half of the tables were empty, which we overlooked assuming that there were some call outs and they may have been short staffed. Next, we sat at the table for 15 minutes without seeing a server. I had to go find a manager to get anyone to our table. When the server finally showed up he took our drink order and we went ahead and ordered. There were for of us so we got two of the 2 for $22 deals (each comes with an app). When were ordered drinks we were told that there was no soda or tea, only water. At this point we should have walked out, but we all ordered water and let it slide. When the server brought the water out it was overflowing and all four glasses spilled all over the table, the server said nothing. Our first app came out (fried pickles). about 20 minutes laster here comes our food. My two girls had ordered a chips and salsa that NEVER came out. I asked about this to the lady who brought or food out and she said she would check on it. I told her that our food was already out and that would defeat the purpose of an appetizer, we just would like the app taken off our check. In ten more minutes the manager came by and said, \"I went ahead and took the chips off your check.\" He didn't apologize and acted as if he were doing me a favor for taking something off the check WE NEVER RECEIVED. The food was also sub par. Three of our chicken crispers were missing sauce. The original crispers seemed soggy. There was no pepper on the corn on the cob as usual. At this point I should also mention that our drinks (and I mean water) had been empty for about 15 minutes. It wasn't till we were done with our food that our server came by and my kids ASKED for a refill, even though we were finished. He NEVER came by the entire time to check if we needed refills. I told him we needed the check, the ziosk machine at our table was not working. He brought the ticket and we thought the nightmare was over. Wrong. I checked the bill to make sure the chips were not on there, they weren't. However, there was a $2 charge for \"table entertainment\". I went to the manager to ask him what this was. He said, \"oh, thats for games you bought on the kiosk machine\". At this point I am about to lose it. I asked him, how the hell could I buy games from a ziosk machine that isn't even working? It seemed that they were trying to sneak that in to make up for the chips that they didn't charge us for that we didn't get. He said he would \"take that off for me too\", again, like he was doing me a favor. He acted like I was annoying him. It took another ten minutes to get the corrected check. Needless to say, we will NEVER EAT AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN.  And if anyone is reading this, I am not a bot or paid \"Yelper\". I am a real person. If fact, you can see for yourself.

We ordered an apple martini which turned out horrible. The drink was taken back, but took way too long to be remade. When we asked about it, our server said it was because the bartender was busy...she wasn't. The queso sauce was nasty. It tasted burned and a bit bitter. Our food finally came and it was lackluster. It all looked so much better on the menu. We didn't finish the food. The martini finally came towards the end. The saving grace was our server. She was very helpful. I don't think we'll be coming back.",

The fact that the wait was long and than once we were seated the wait for the server to show up was longer too!! I went around 7:30ish and it was on Valentine's Day. So i can understand the wait before getting a table but just don't appreciate having to wait for the server to show up. Got the Valentine dinner special, 2 for $35.   Got the table side guac($2.00 upgrade), bacon cheeseburger, half rack of ribs, 2 Presidential martinis and than finished it off with the white chocolate molten cake. Waited so long our hunger was just striding away my g/f took her ribs Togo and I ate most of my bacon burger but just felt exhausted from all the waiting we had to do. Server was very friendly tho once she got to our table. When it comes to the food it was edible but Chilli's is Chilli's I mean who hasn't been to Chilli's!!!!",

Now, we eat chilis on a regular and I'm telling you I ordered chicken crispers, loaded mashed potatoes, and steamed broccoli, my mashed potatoes, loaded at that came back with just the cheese on top not melted at all and they were cold I sent them back and asked for another one. Instead, hot mashed potatoes with no cheese the manager brought more mashed potatoes, he did not apologize didn't show any concern didn't really care I work in the food industry so I understand and if I see any of my servers giving bad customer service as the manager was then I definitely would advise them to find a new career path the manager  Dewayne at the university location should definitely think of a new career path because I dont think this is what he wants to do anymore.   Now the best part of my visit was Bola is a great server very great customer service he served us very well  Lindsey the manager that was at the host stand gave us very great customer she made us feel sooooo welcomed I commend her on that!",

We had to keep asking for items that were supposed to be with the food when it came to the table. The waiter didn't give us any silverware we had to wait about 5-6 mins until another waiter walked by to get it. Don't get me started on the women's restroom which was disgusting!!!

    "text": "It's Chili's.  Most people have eaten at a Chili's and know what to expect from the menu.  I use to eat the hell out of Chili's back 15 years ago.  It use to be my go to place for ribs, fajitas, and of course margaritas.  I don't make it to Chili's a lot these days unless it is out of convenience.  The one cool thing about Chili's, which I wish more restaurants would adopt, is the tablets at the table.  You can order food, reorder drinks, and most important to me, pay at your table without ever giving your card to a waiter/waitress.    The food here is okay.  You can get better ribs, fajitas, burgers, etc. at other places.  Of course Chili's is solid with their food.  I think Chili's is one of the better chains to eat at.  This Chili's is clean.  Service and food was decent.  I normally stick with the classic items on their menu (skillet queso, fajitas).  They have different margaritas on the menu which is cool.  My one issue, though minor, is when I walked in the place it was about at 50% capacity, yet there were three other parties (2-4 people each) waiting for a table.  I opted for the bar area (normally first come first served) but the hosted said it was a 10-15 minute wait for a table in the bar area.  Note, the bar area tables were probably 25% occupied.  I found that rather odd.  Perhaps they were short on wait staff.  I just grabbed a seat at the bar.",

Came by this location before a concert - very close to our hotel and basically on the way to the PNC Pavilion.   We were seated promptly, in the bar, as it was pretty early. Waitress was kind enough, but super slow because she seemed to be the only server available. She took our order, brought out 2 glasses of water with black specs suspended in the water- YUCK!!! Asked for replacements, which she provided in time. My Buffalo Chicken sandwich tasted like fried shoe leather, basically uneatable. Fries were stone cold. Wife had the fish tacos - overcooked again - no taste.  Next time we will skip this location.",

We still USUALLY enjoy Chili's even with so many changes, because most are consistent with the quality and consistency we expect from s chili's. This one did NOT deliver with terrible (nonexistent) service, food over cooked to inedibility, and management that was abominable and absent, except when a fight broke out at a nearby table. Chips initially served were not warm, not salted, and old (stale).  Salsa was pure liquid, no bulk. The place was not empty but it was nowhere near busy at 430 pm. I was embarrassed to be a former employee and I know my prior managers would NEVER have allowed such shoddy work. Don't go here! I'd like to give a ZERO rating. Management's interest in reviews is empty because it is evident they've taken no corrective action on the many very low reviews.",

I ordered margarita grilled chicken, which came out with a huge black hair front and center in my rice. Okay, no biggie, things happen. The manager brought a new plate out and it was fine...until I started helping my toddler with her chicken strips. There was a large piece of melted plastic in the breading of her chicken strip. Thankfully I pay close attention and she didn't have a chance to eat it...it's just extremely irresponsible especially considering this was a child's meal! Aside from that the entire restaurant needs a good deep cleaning and I was shocked to see servers piling dirty dishes onto one empty table from several different tables. Just gross.",

Unfortunately EVERY single time I go (especially to this location) I receive TERRIBLE service no matter the time or day. It takes forever to be greeted, to get drinks, to even order food. There are multiple employees not doing anything but for some reason everything always takes forever. Multiple tables are dirty. My friend came to meet me shortly after I arrived and we had to ASK to get him a drink because multiple people just kept walking by us. Sitting at the bar currently and had old food sitting next to me, instead of removing it she sets in right under the beer tap. Gross. I have been staring at it for 20 minutes now. Overall I love chili's for the food and drinks but they need to train their bartenders & servers better and focus on cleanliness.",

Not the end of the world, but still. I grab my order and head home, only to find the ranch dressing in my 3 for $10 crispy tenders to be spilled all over my chicken tenders. It was literally thrown all over the place. Even if I got swept up in a whirlwind, if the lid was properly fastened, it wouldn't have spilled everywhere. My fries were inedible, and my tenders were more ranch flavored than chipotle flavored. My additional order had tasteless asparagus, and my baked potato soup was chock full of bacon though I requested no bacon. The tenders were plentiful but stringy, and again, coated in ranch. After the wait, poor presentation, and tasteless, tough food, I won't be returning for a while. I wasted $40 tonight. I should have gone somewhere for my chicken cravings.",

The bartender apologized and took the plate away to have it redone. I then told him if they are cooking it that hard,  please ask to have them make it medium. He said ok.  The replacement plate came with a smaller cut of steak and was medium rare when I cut into it. So the bartender presented me with a plate to put the steak on to have it replaced again...or so I thought! He actually brought back the same cut up steak, recooked! By this time im starving so I am willing to eat it, however it was room temperature! Who wants a slightly warm steak?

I will update once we get our food..  Update: the drinks are HORRIBLE. I got the quesadilla. FULL OF GREASE. Couldn't even taste the flavor of the chicken. The corn tortilla smelt and tasted burnt. We got the 2 for $25...so now we wait for the dessert. I'll be back.  8:40....still waiting on my dessert  9:01 for my dessert...9:06....sigh...my cookie is burnt...but at least my ice cream is cold.",

    "text": "I gave this location multiple chances before leaving my review. I work next door too this Chili's location so I have placed to-go orders online multiple times. I have a 30 minute lunch break so I always place my order at least an hour ahead and request it be ready at 1:00 so I can pick it up & rush back to the office to eat. Long story short, my orders are always wrong, food is always cold, or my food is not ready at all. Today, I ordered a chicken taco lunch combo at 12:10.... an hour later and it's still not ready. So I'm officially done with this location. A complete waste of time & money.",

    "text": "Mixed emotions. Server and food was awesome. But the bartender yelled at our server on the floor in front of guests. I'm so turned off about it. Haven't seen a manager the whole time to let them know how I feel. We had to chase them down. After we did our server apologized to the bartender  and the bartender was like it's okay. No, no it's not okay. It's disrespectful and unprofessional. Sad I wasted my date night with my husband here. Restaurant was really messy. Tons of chunks on the floor. So it makes me nervous what the kitchen looks like.  I've debated on if I should post this review. But from looking at other recent reviews things haven't gotten any better. Shame on upper management.",
