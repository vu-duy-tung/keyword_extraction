The lady was so rude, that while talking to me, she ignored me and took the call to take orders, and I had to wait just for telling that we ordered online. And the wings were very bad compared to what we had earlier. Poor service and worst food. Will not suggest.",

She was very prompt with our service. The second time I went I was slightly disappointed with the service I came in about 50 mins before closing Expecting a quick bite to eat since just got off work. I simply ignore by the sever in my section she didn't even acknowledge us at all, Went to acknowledge a different table to ask for their drink when they came in 10 mins after me. I sat there with 15 mins waiting with no sever acknowledging me. I had to walk to the manger and just ask with 2 waters to start with. Their bartender had to walk over and ask what we wanted to drink if we were ready to order because he saw we had not been waited on. He was very polite and apologize. Took our drink order and food order. The manger was nice of to give us two different snack size boneless wings instead of the small in place of us waiting so long. Which was really nice. Overall it was a nice experience I debt if I want to come back",

When I was at the register I checked the bag and noticed their wasn't any ranch/blue cheese that typically comes with at...virtually every establishment known to man. The attendant says \"Oh no that is extra\". Are you kidding me? Not only did I pay for wings the size of a child's thumb but I cannot even get a measly set of celery sticks and cup of ranch. When I returned home and opened up the box...the disappointment continued. Mind you I live 3 minutes away. The wing were cold and were extremely hard. I could not even finish them. I will go the distance and drive somewhere else. I will not be back at this establishment",

I did not review it the second time because it was busy and I felt bad.  I am reviewing it now because I ordered a small to go order FOR THE SUPER BOWL (a event that a wing place opened for several months now should have been more than prepared for) is STILL NOT READY.  I ordered at 6:20p.  The young lady on the phone told me no problem, it will be done in an hour.  I was ok with this wait.  My boyfriend left at 7:20 to pick up the food (5 min from my apartment) and is still there waiting.  Why? Because they felt that they shouldn't put the order in until the guest arrived for their pick up???   Let me get this straight.  Ordered an hour before pick up.  Order not put in until 7:30.  Its now 9pm and I still have no clue why my small order of wings are not ready. Our Super Bowl night is ruined.    You had ONE JOB Buffalo Wild Wings.  No wonder why everyone hates this location.  Your management stinks.    If I could give this place 0 stars I would.   Oh, and the first two times I ate here I sat at the bar.  My food was 40 minutes late because they served it to someone else both times. No one knew how this could have possibly happened.",

When we arrived it took them around 10 minutes to seat us, which was irritating considering they weren't busy and there were clearly tables open and servers standing around. When we sat down, our waitress explained that she was new and had only been working for a few days. She was clearly a little nervous which was understandable. However,when our food came out, one of our orders was missing. She said she would go check on it, and never came back. Clearly she forgot to ring it in, and 20 minutes later our order came out. This is a lack of training on this locations part and we will not be back. The only reason why I gave it two stars is because the waitress was sweet and apologetic and the manager was professional.",

It's always great to watch the myriad televisions available so that we can keep up with all of the sporting news esp. in the NFL this week.  The little one ordered the mild wings but we had to send them back for plain wings because the mild had a wee too much heat for a 7-year old (lesson learned).  All in all, it was a good dinner and I look forward to returning for more wings!",

    "text": "Disclaimer:This will be long because so many things were unacceptable, and i feel they are worth mentioning. Hopefully someone in charge reads this. This place needs Bar Rescue or an intervention from corporate.   Where do I begin with this disaster? I arrived in the late afternoon/early evening on Valentine's Day. I walked in and stopped at the hostess stand. The girl who is standing there saw me and then walked away to speak with to the left of the entrance (I'm assuming it was the to go area). The person she spoke to pointed her back to me and told her to seat me prior to whatever they were discussing.  I requested a table off to the side so that I wouldn't have my back to the dining room while using my tablet. This proved to be a difficult request for the hostess.  She flagged down a 2nd hostess who said she could help. She walked me past many open tables/areas to a high table next to the end of the bar. At the time, it seemed fine.   A server walked by my table and asked me if the hostesses seated me. Her tone was not friendly. I said yes and she walked off with another server that had come by, mumbling about to them about having her table sat. I didn't even get a standard \"______ is your server,\" or \"your server will be right with you,\" from her rude interaction.  My server Bruce arrived and he was the only positive from this experience. He was great. Personable,  he told me about the specials, & answered my menu questions. He gave 5 star service(or as close as you can get in a wing joint). They desperately need more employees like him.  About 2 minutes after I initially say down I noticed a group of staff(3-8 people, the number varied [including the female mgr]) beginning to congregate at the end of the bar behind where I was sitting. Their conversations ranged from why they were quitting their jobs,  how much they no longer liked the place, to why no one should be in there on Valentines Day, and how pathetic it was to be there. They suggested the customers should go to Olive Garden across the street. While hanging out, one of the servers was eating the fruit used to garnish drinks. That's definitely not health inspector approved. The bartender told her to stop because she's 'tired of getting cussed out over the missing fruit.' A few minutes later one of them knocked a stack of serving trays on the ground where they were leaning.That was it for me. I could no longer tolerate being there. It felt more like a middle schoolunch room than a restaurant.  I've never seen a restaurant that has the staff hanging out in large groups during business hours near customers. The other bad reviews were right, there is a serious lack of professionalism and respect from the staff.   My order came out and I had it boxed up for takeout. The wings were on the bottom end of average. I got 2 different sauces. The honey mustard wings barely had any sauce. About half of each wing had sauce and the flavor was weak. The parmesean garlic wings had enough sauce but I didn't care for them.",

The design of the place isn't bad, except for the bathrooms being right by the front door, past the hostess stand. I don't need a \"thanks, have a nice night\" when I go to pee everytime.  I generally go on the wing special nights, Tuesday and Thursday. Not normally very busy, but on several occasions I've waited 10 or more minutes to have someone take my drink order. Once the girl took the order, then disappeared. Another server took over and seemed confused as to what happened to her.  Food has been good, can't really mess up Wings. Well, you can, but they haven't. Drink specials leave alot to be desired. 5 bucks for a Budweiser isn't a deal. Hopefully in time they will improve, it is a new location, but the time for growing pains to be over is now.",

When we got there is ordered we were toldthat blue cheese would be extra. She told us that, because we were getting the $.60 wing deal, that all sauces such as blue cheese or ranch would be an additional $.60 per sauce. I was very upset about that, and I wanted to leave then. Unfortunately, the people I was there with wanted to eat Buffalo wild wing that day. Checking the price the $.60 wings deal was too good to pass up, so I decided to stay and eat. When the wings came out, they were very well cooked which is how I like them.I noticed that the sauce didn't cover the wings all the way. It appeared that they had toss the wings and the sauce but didn't have enough sauce to completely cover the wings. When you order buffalo wings with the sauce you expect there to be sauce all over the wings and not just on half of it. At this point, I was getting a little upset about the need to pay $.60 for my blue cheese when I had wings I didn't have enough sauce. It strongly appear that they were trying to cover the cost of having a $.60 wings special by adding the cost to the customer and the difference by making them pay for blue cheese or ranch.  I am never again coming to this location for the $.60 wings special day ever again. You cannot offer a special to your client event bury, in the details, price is that the client needs to pay. What's next? A day when the wings are $.50 but water cost two dollars? Ridiculous!",

The service was very slow, over a 15 minute wait for a salad and a wrap (which they messed up) we were given a timer if it went past 15 minutes your meal is free. While we waited there were two managers standing near us not really concerned with the wait even though another server stopped by to let them know our timer had gone past 15 minutes. After we got our meal they made the wrap wrong so they had to remake it at that point we just asked for a salad instead. No manager came over to talk to us and we ended up having to pay for one of the salad even though we waited past 15 minutes for them. Why have a system in place that you will not honor.

I've only done take out here which is very quick and the staff is friendly and always recommend their favorites.",

    "text": "Its your average Buffalo Wild Wings.  Plenty of tv's, pretty good wings, and a decent tap list.  I honestly wasn't impressed, but they just opened so I'll give them that extra star.  Especially since the only other wing place around is East Coast WIngs and they aren't anything special either.  We were seated quickly on a Sunday right at 1pm.  Since there were only 2 of us they tried to put us on the sides or next to the wait station in the dining room at some very small tables.  We decided to go to the bar instead.  We were greeted quickly and told the specials.  Our waitress, Ashley, was pleasant, bubbly, and quite attentive.  We asked about specific recommendations on beers and I don't know if she knew the beer list that well as 2 of the best IPA's around were on tap and neither were mentioned when I asked about IPA's.  Lagunitas and Southern Tier are great.  Not knowing that, I ordered a Sweetwater 420.  Something wasn't right with it, so she poured me another one.  My counterpart ordered a bloody Mary that was horrible.  Tasted like V8 and nothing else.  Was supposed to be \"wild\"?  No spice, very little vodka.  We also ordered the tailgate sampler.  Great sampler per dollar.  4 wings, stuffed jalapeno's, pretzels, and pita points with artichoke dip.  I probably should have ordered more wings but otherwise no complaints.  It wasn't a bad experience, it just wasn't all that.  This place should do fine as a family style restaurant but doesn't seem to have the energy of a sports bar.  I'll be back again and again until something more legit comes to the Northlake area.",

One of the take out folks asked us if we wanted to eat in or to go, and upon learning we wanted to eat here did nothing.   Once we got seated 5 min later the waitress came to get our drink order and appetizer order. 15 min past and we got our appetizer which was the wrong one, and still no drinks. So my wife went to the bar to get them and was told they have been here for awhile I'm not sure were you waitress is. So another 10 min goes by and the waitress comes back and we let her know we had the wrong appetizer. I still don't know exactly what she was saying, but it was something along the lines of yeah I meant to tell you this is what your getting.   It was interesting reading the reviews here it seems my experience is the norm. This reflects just great of the management there. I thought this was a one off situation, I guess not.",

    "text": "I can't believe I never reviewed this place from my trip on 9/16/14 but after giving a poor review on service at a BW's in Michigan I read the reviews for this one and decided it's time to add to the reviews.  I showed up with my 8&10 yr old kids on a weekday and the place wasn't too busy. As far as I remember the food was fine and service was mediocre. However, what happened that night was negatively memorable.  I heard loud yelling coming from the kitchen area and some staff came running out. First thought, fire!?, robbery!? Either way I get beside my kids and grab arms ready to run out the door. The ruckus continued and all staff just looked back into the kitchen. They seemed concerned but not in an urgent way. A manager then came out and ordered everyone to disperse and got on the phone.  Our waitress came by and I asked her if everything was OK. She said, \"the cooks got in a fight and one tried to push the other in a fryer!\"  I wasn't shocked however, she did just say that in front of my 8&10 year old. At this point I boxed our food up and left as the cops were pulling in.   Now BW's was a favorite place of mine in the mid to late 90's in Mt. Pleasant Michigan. They had a good hold on college towns. As with many companies they want to grow. They need to keep their customer service and prices in check as they do this. I like the guy from The League in their commercials but that doesn't mean crap when you get bad service at high prices. I predict their growth to falter and a restructuring on the horizon.",

I'll start by saying I love Bdubs and their wide variety of beers and wing sauces. Which is awesome!  With that said here we go!  Service was completely horrible!! I couldn't tell you our waitresses name I think the hour in a half we were there she came by the table once which was because I flagged her down to get the check. We never got refills, the manager had to come by and fill them up which he was a pretty cool character but let the place run like a madhouse.   It was if no one there cared about their job nor the customers. You could clearly hear the kitchen staff yelling for \"runners\" and the staff to come get the food. But when you'd look over everyone was just sitting in the corner talking and hanging out. Even the manager just walked by and didn't do anything about it.   The food we got was just okay, nothing amazing I mean I've been to other Bdubs and have had better food. The food was cold and at that point it was just pointless to bother arguing about it.   When we finally got the waitress to bring us our check we waited over 20 minutes just for her to return my card I thought we'd never leave.  I can for sure say I'd never come back here as the staff is a complete bust and a waste of time. If the store in University was still open I would've just gone there. Just pass on this place.",

After that, I went home, went to sleep, and I was woken up in the middle of the night with a BAD case of a bacteria-induced food poisoning infection, in which I am still recovering now. For those who have never experienced it, it's like getting hit with a hammer in your stomach with your arse h*le on fire as well, along with the feeling of digesting glass. I will never trust their food again or buy any food from Buffalo Wild Wings. They should be held responsible being a professional food chain. Safety standards should be higher.

Once u get your seat assignment you better hope you get a server that actually gives a crap.  We were lucky this time to have one that could give two shits about what was going on. It was like an episode of punk'd except i didn't end up seeing Ashton Kutcher at the end.  Anyway you guys need alot of help and for the love of god the management just needs to start fresh!!!",

We called to place a to go order, was placed on hold for over 5 minutes, then hung up on.  It's close to close on a sports free Sunday night, so I can't imagine that they were so busy that they couldn't take our order.  I was tempted to call back and ask for the manager, but I didn't have time to be on hold for another 5 minutes, so I turned to yelp.

The waitress came back and couldn't tell us how many wings came with a kids menu. Our food took another hour, and once brought out everything was wrong. Food was very mediocre at best, and it took so long to get everything fixed. Then all of our checks were messed up and one of us had an order of fries added to their check when they hadn't ordered any. To top it off, one of my guest went to the restroom thirty minutes before we left and their was a literal piece of crap on the ground. He told the staff who then did nothing about it. Thirty minutes later he checked and it still was there. It was disgusting and very much so a waste of time. The food, service, and atmosphere was just a no go. If I could give negative stars... I would.",

I've been coming to Buffalo Wild Wings for years, and as busy as they can get I've never had a bad experience - until i moved to charlotte and started going to the Northlake Location. EVERY time I've come there has been issues, as a result of extremely poor customer service. It takes forever to get seated even though you can see plenty of available tables. The wait staff is always extremely rude, barely stops to check on you and as a matter of fact once they drop the food off you won't see them again until they bring your check. My last visit over the weekend with my sister and nephew was horrible. We waited at the front of the restaurant for over 20 minutes never to be greeted by a host. There was no host standing at the station and during that time frame we asked at least 4 other staff members who were walking around aimlessly and even went and asked someone working at carry out if there was a host and if we could be seated. Instead of anybody taking a minute to seat us at one of the many tables, they all as a group went looking for the person who was supposed to be the host. During the time that they were all collectively on a manhunt for the host, the line continues to pile up and now there are at least 6 groups waiting to be seated and the line is out the door in cold and rainy weather. After about 10 more minutes the host comes out of the bathroom, doesn't say two words to us and instead seats the family that was waiting behind us. They were as confused as we were as we had all been waiting for far too long and clearly we had been there before they were and should have been seated first. He then comes back, looks at us and without saying anything grabs 3 menus and starts walking. We had to assume that maybe he was now going to seat us so we followed him to our booth. As soon as we sit down, the manager comes out from the kitchen and we waved her down - after explaining to her what happened she simply said she would speak to her staff about it, no apology, just that and then she started to walk away. We stopped her and asked if we could get a high chair for my nephew and some crayons for him to which she replied they don't have coloring books or crayons. Our waitress brought over the high chair, along with the coloring book and crayons that we knew they had. Our waitress was quite rude, never stopped at the table but instead when walking by would ask if we were okay - while she kept walking. At this point i will never be returning to this Buffalo Wild Wings as it is clear that nobody on their staff not even the manager is concerned with providing good customer service or resolving a customer complaint!!!!",

Again, this is one of those places located near my job so I come here due to convenience rather than quality. However, it's obviously not that bad where it stops me from coming altogether.   They have a 'fast-break' lunch menu consisting of about six items - one of them being the hickory pulled pork sandwich - that ranges in price from $5.99 to about $9.99. The sauce that's used is smoky sweet and the pork is juicy, topped with crisp, cool coleslaw and pickled onions. The fries that come with are typically hot and slightly salty. It's the one thing I've found that is consistently good.  Service can be hit or miss here. Definitely don't bother coming here with a large party greater than five people. Your food will be crawling its way to the table. Also, they have a sign on the doors stating that anyone under the age of 18 is not permitted to dine inside without a parent/guardian....which I find a little odd and would love to know what drove them to make that decision.",

They have a long list of sauces from no spice at all on up to burning fire. Pick your wings and pick a sauce. I'm no fan of super spicy but Honey BBQ (my personal favorite) is in the middle of the spice-o-meter and it's not even a baby kick. I like to try out anything new on tap and they have a fairly extensive selection both there and in bottles. Not sure the total number but on tap it looks like about 15-20 beers all the time. Plenty of local options too, which I consider a plus.  For the bad, I was fairly unimpressed with the hostess stand and responsiveness. When you come in, without fail there will be 1) nobody in sight near the stand 2) somebody there with their back turned and talking to a coworker not giving a crap or 3) somebody there just staring at you as if to ask \"why'd you come here?\"  My advice, if your group is small, is to just skip all that crap and bee-line for the bar. CC (the bartender) has never done me wrong. She keeps my glasses full, my wings aplenty and carries a steady conversation. If you're in a group, get drunk that way you won't know how bad the service was...",

Here, me and my girlfriends IDs were both taken and held under black lights.   All of this is laughable and I can look past. However, the service was also horrible. I ordered a salad which came out with my wings. When the server brought the food she said \"here you go\" and walked away. 10 minutes later she came over to peter us about some rewards thing that no one cares about. Didn't take no for an answer twice and left the stupid thing by us.   She is currently moving back and forth between  slurping whipped cream or some thick white substance out of a cup and counting her tip money with a disdained look on her face.

From the walking in the door and no one greeting you, to the time you walked out and the hostess at the door didn't say have a good night come back or anything.  So many things wrong, from the way the servers talked about customers at the bar, to the servers sitting around on their cellphones, to the servers going behind the bar when the bartender went to the kitchen to get their drinks and then not discarding the ticket, to the servers touching all over the limes, lemons instead of using the prongs that were RIGHT there, to the food that took over 40 minutes to get out, to the manager who could only slowly clean cups at the bar, to the shift lead who was slowing down the bartender because she didn't know how to do or find anything behind the bar. It was a shit show is putting it nice.   Now don't get me wrong, there was one shining moment. Danielle, the bartender, was alone behind the bar and even though she had SO many tickets continually pouring out, no one getting the food for her at the pass, no one who knew what to do helping her. She kept a smile on her face and did the best to get everything out to us. The only shining light in this place is her.   My boyfriend doesn't love coming here because of price, size of wing, and actual quality but I love it. After today's experience it's going to be super hard to get him back out. Also mind you this was all taking place after 9pm so not even prime time fo dinner.   BWW you can do better, I know, I worked at one.",

It took forEVER for someone to even greet us at the door. So we decided to just eat in the bar area. And When I say NO TABLES AT THE BAR AREA WAS CLEAN!! There was about 6 plus open tables but all was dirty. I had go and ask for a manager to get same the tables cleaned.

You have a service staff that is neither friendly nor inclined to provide service to their guests.  We usually order carryout and EVERY time and I do mean EVERY time there is a mishap with our order; the waits are excruciatingly long and NONE of the staff seems bothered by the fact that a crowd is forming because NO ONE is getting what they ordered in a timely fashion.  When you bother to ask someone they say \"ok\" and disappear for what seems like forever to only come back and state the obvious -that they are working on it.  :(  The manager NEVER shows his or her face and the last time because our service was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO awful I requested to speak with her and she offered me a measly $10 coupon for my next visit - NEXT VISIT what about this one????  The person who rings you up had filthy hands (dirt underneath his LONG fingernails), the staff emerging from the kitchen looked as unkempt and again a HUGE crowd had formed due to LACK OF SERVICE and NO ONE seemed bothered by it.

    "text": "This was my first time eating at a Buffalo Wild Wings, and since this location was under a year old, I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone and give it a shot.  We (a group of 5: 3 adults and 2 kids) arrived at just after 7pm.  The restaurant was busy, but definitely not full, as we were seated right away and there were several other tables empty in our section.  Our server took our drink order and then answered a few questions about the kids menu. My sister ordered wings - oriental something and curry something, while her husband had a buffalo chicken sandwich.  I had a grilled chicken salad with their own ranch dressing, and the kids had corn dog bites.  The Good:  My salad was good.  Can't really complain about that.  The chicken sandwich was good as well.  The Not-So-Good:  The wings were REALLY spicy.  My brother in law basically has hot sauce in his veins and HE said it was overly spicy!  Also, a side of celery and carrots came out with the wings...3 sticks of carrots and 2 of celery.  The celery was very pale and one honestly looked like a filet of a bigger piece.  I would struggle to call it an actual celery stick.  The BAD:  Service.  Like I said, the restaurant was NOT full.  It was busy, but not full.  Our order took OVER 40 minutes to get to our table.  I played 3 full games of Texas Holdem on their little computer table thing to kill time and the food still was not there.  Even worse, we were never given any updates.  Our waitress pretty much just left us alone.  My sister finally asked ANOTHER waitress to get our waitress so we could see when we were finally going to eat.  The waitress never came, but the one she asked gave us an update and the food arrived about 5 minutes later. Second, our waitress, was not what I would call a \"in a good mood\" girl that night, and it showed.  While polite, she just did not have a friendly demeanor.  She did her job, but that's what it seemed like she was doing.  It was very impersonal, and the fact she didn't bother to notice we sat there for 40 minutes with no food and never offered any kind of explanation (the kitchen is backed up, or offered to check on what's the hold up), I really cannot give the service a good review.  For a dinner that should have been done within 45 minutes total, it took WAY too long on a night that was not extremely busy by restaurant standards.  I am honestly in no rush to go back to Buffalo Wild Wings any time soon.",

I ordered a simple appetizer and my cousin ordered 6 wings.  When we got the order at least 30 minutes after we ordered it came out cold.  DO not waste your time coming to this place.",

    "text": "This is my 3rd time to this location and it's gone from bad to worse. I can't believe the servers and hosts stand around talking knowing people are waiting to be seated or served.  Tonight was the best! We got the \"we're waiting for a table to be cleaned\" excuse, but they were all clean the hostess was just trying to finish her conversation.  We finally get seated and order. Someone tries to bring us another tables appetizer TWICE. Might I mention we never got the appetizer we ordered (probably ended up at another table). Wings came out cold-seriously! The only good thing was the onion rings which is just sad and the only reason I gave them one star. The best part...my husband asks for the check and is signing the receipt when the server throws a used paper towel into my husbands beer glass (which was a little less then half full). When he saw the look on my husband face he asked \"sorry we're you done with that\"? Yeah buddy we're done with this place all together.  I'll drive the extra miles to another BWW any day!",

The food, wings, steak wrap, jalapeno poppers and a couple of  kid meals where whAt you would expect - good however, the server, made it especially good.  She was kind and very prompt.  She made sure our kids were taken care of and we never had to ask for anything.  She was wonderful. She was rewarded with a big compliment to the manger and a very generous tip. Thank you so much Vern. You are awesome!",

I ordered a 20-count boneless wing with various dressings. Every last one of them was horrible!  Cold, chewy, meat droppings, each with an undistinguished coating, is the best description I can give them. A 20 piece McNugget from McDonald's would have been much better.",

We had the dry seasoned lemon pepper , salt and vinegar and barbecue and the spicy garlic wings. The waitress , Kelly suggested that we try their specialty \"grand slam\" beer to go with the wings. I must say that I was impressed. My only suggestion would be to add more seasoning! Oh and ask for Kelly !",

The waitress OMG that waitress we had was so damn rude!!! We spoke with the manager Chris who was nice and asked us to give them another chance and also provided us with the DM phone number (Bob).  Well we decided to give them another chance (bad decision on our part) and what do you know the moment we sat down the waiter didn't even come greet us  so about 15 min later this other waitress took our table because he never came and went off on her right in front of us because he said he had enough tables and he WAS NOT going to help us!!!! To make matters worse we called the district manager left message and he never returned our call...explains the staff they hire if that's the type of upper management Buffalo Wild Wings hires!!! Never Again!!!",

    "text": "We discovered that the one in University was closed down so we headed to this one.  It was our first time. The location and parking was not very convenient to start with. It was pretty dead for a Thursday evening.  They had about 15 staffs or more working with nothing to do.  Everyone was pretty much standing around. Our waiter was always rushing us on our orders. I guess because she wanted to get back to chit chatting in the back kitchen.  After we were done with our food, our waiter was nowhere in site for over 20 minutes or so. Two other  staff were chatting away so loud behind us like we didn't exist. At one point, one of the girls did take notice that we seem to be searching for our waiter, but did not offer to see if we needed anything.  She instead carried on her conversation with the other girl. We watched at least 10 staff including the manager walking around for at least 20 minutes or so before I finally told the waiter behind me if she could go find our waiter for us.   The wings also were not seasoned well and all mix in together. Needless to say,  we will probably not be going here anymore.",

My wife and I walked in and waited for the two hostess at the front to finish their conversation. I had to walk up and ask for a table. One girl rudely told us to sit where we want and someone would bring us menus. We waited about 5 mins for the waitress to walk up and ask us what we want to drink. She didn't know the drink specials so we both ordered water. We both ordered wings and they were small with little to no sauce-not to mention cold, like they had been made the day before. I would have let our waitress know, but she never came back to the table. We asked for extra napkins when the food was dropped off- never got them. With mediocre food and empty waters we were just ready to leave. I found our waitress by the bar and asked for our check. She said she would bring it right over. We waited for about 10 mins, left cash on the table and left. Needless to say we won't be back.",

    "text": "First time at this location... As soon as we walked in the door no one was to be found. After about 3 minutes finally someone asked if we have been helped and then was told someone will be with us shortly. The take out employee then asked us what we wanted to go.. Then we responded to be seated. After we got seated Kendra was our server. She was a good server although some things could of been done differently. We where not told about any of the specials untill we have received our wings. Then we where informed about the 65cent wings. No drink specials where talked about so we just ordered some tea.. If so we would of had a few drinks and The bill would of been higher as well as a bigger tip... About a minute and a half of actual table service was given. It was very slow this afternoon which is a perfect time to interact with tables and work us up for a bigger tip. Instead of doing that there were two employees sitting in the dining room eating like that was ok. Not only that but one girl was ordering a pizza on the phone!!! I know the employees don't always want the same food but at least it could of been done behind closed doors. Not in front of customers!!!! I usually tip very well 20 to 50 percent of the bill. Depending on overall service not just our server. if there would have been better teamwork we would have turned into weekly customer.... I'm not upset with Kendra, I've been there before. Just a little more help and training and she will be an awesome server. The manager leads by example.. In saying that, when it is extremely slow like today he/she should be walking around and going to tables thanking them for coming In... And be checking to see if everything is ok.. If that would of happened the problem would of been fixed and this would not be on yelp for the whole world to see. I might return this Saturday for the fight but if this happens again I will not be returning to this location again.. 50 dollars a week 2600 dollars or more a year for 1 customer only. Think about it !!",
