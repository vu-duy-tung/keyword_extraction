    "text": "After learning that Bang Bang Burgers have a second location at South End last night, I managed to drag my husband and son to this joint tonight.  First of all, I love the casual decor (mix of wood & industrial).  Although this is a smallish restaurant, it has a spacious style...thanks to its high ceilings.  I definitely prefer the overall vibe here over the one at their original location.  However, it's basically the same menu as Bang Bang Burgers.  I heard that this location used to serve up Sliders, but they seemed to have discontinued them.  No matter, no complaints here.  I tried the \"K-Pop Burgers\" this time (last time, I tried their signature Bang Bang Burgers...which was the Bomb!)...and it did not disappoint.  Who knew Kimchee would go so well with a Burger??  I also tried the Sweet Potato Fries (instead of the standard Fries or the Onion Rings) this time...and that also did not disappoint.  My husband (Mushroom & Swiss Burger) and son (Cowboy Burger ) were also very happy with their burgers and fries .  In short, this burger joint is Awesome...definitely my favorite burger spot in town!  If only they'd open even a third location closer to me??",

    "text": "Honestly, I had high hopes for bang bang bites Since bang bang burgers is my favorite burger place in Charlotte. I have to say that I was very disappointed. It is overpriced for what you get. I ordered the fried mac & cheese in the bacon cheddar sliders. The fried mac & cheese was pretty good. The bacon cheddar was a joke. It was tiny with melted shredded cheese. The patties were very small and did not fill the buns. My fries tasted like they were cooked 10 minutes before I ordered. I've never had that problem at the original bang bang. I don't think that we will be going back unless something changes regarding the menu at bang bang bites. I do appreciate the concept and that they're giving the opportunity for people to try different burger toppings. We will stick with bang bang burgers in the future.",

As for the food, I ordered 3 sliders: siracha, k-pop, and the pimento. They were ok, but at $15 for three and chips, the price was steep and I still felt hungry when I left. I did not get asked how I wanted my sliders cooked and they were super well done (boo!). The chips were average at best.  I heard this morning Joe is going back to his original model of no sliders. Good man to put your ego aside and kudos for trying something different and listening to the feedback of your customers.  I hope this choice is successful for you! Would possibly come back at some point.",

It's one of those places where you order first. Definitely take their recommendations! Cowboy Burger, SUPERB! The bun, the meat, the fries...perfection. Wife had the Siracha burger and was blown away. She judges a place by how good their ranch is. It was bomb. Go, go now! You'll be really happy.",

Overall seems like a lot is made from scratch and sourced in Charlotte which is awesome. I got the single pimento burger. The burger itself was really good. But the bun was too much bread for the single, the fried pickles were all breading (took them off), the pimento cheese was not that great I actually took half of it off too. It was not served with any lettuce or toppings like most places. The dipping sauces were also off almost they all had too much mayo which almost tasted low fat. We tried ranch and bang bang, neither were that great. Fries were fresh and great! Bbq chips were good but since they make in batches some were not crispy from sitting. On a side note the heat was out and freezing but they fixed while there and it got better but it was ice cold at first. They did apologize and acknowledge the issue. If they nail down the test the burgers will be 5 stars",

    "text": "One word - WOW. Ok more than one word - omg these burgers are sooo good! I ordered the cowboy which was one of their popular options and is basically a BBQ bacon cheeseburger without LTO. As I was waiting for our food I mentioned to hubby that maybe I should've added them on, but I'm glad I didn't because I think it made the flavor of the burger come through that much more, and what a flavor it was. Even the bun was good. They serve their sauces on the side which is cool so you can add as little or as much as you'd like. When the burger first came, it seemed kinda tiny but I felt satisfied. Hubby ordered the hangover which he loved and I had a bite of and liked too. Even he gave it a 5 which is very impressive considering he doesn't hand them out easily. The fries weren't the best I've had for some reason, but I still ate them all because I love my fries haha. DEFINITELY coming back again and glad I signed up for the rewards program.",

It is one of the best burger places in Southend and well worth every penny! The burgers are not only delicious, but very healthy. Everyone SHOULD be eating grass-fed beef so when I saw they offered this, I was instantly a fan.   2. I can't remember his name but every time I come in, there is a guy that usually helps take my order. He is super nice, always recognizes me, and we end up having a great conversation. I always enjoy seeing him in there.   3. The one bad experience I had, which had NOTHING to do with the food but instead with the service (I believe they forgot we were on hold when we tried to order take out) was so nicely resolved. Just the fact that Joe, the owner/operator was nice enough to write a long apology went such a long way. Thank you for doing that. I was in the service industry for a very long time and I understand mistakes happen, but the fact that he took time to write back meant everything. We look forward to coming back a million more times... thanks Joe!",

The chips however were very nice. Fresh and crispy! But for $10 for a single burger with nothing on it but bacon and cheese. Then you have to pay 4 dollars extra for chips and a drink. Take your money elsewhere if you are looking for a filling meal!",

I am a firm believer that they serve the best burgers in town, so the loss of easy access to that location was pretty disappointing.  When I heard about the new location I was skeptical about the bites concept, but was thrilled that they reworked it and went back to what they do better than anyone else in the city! We visited finally this weekend and I was more than satisfied that the quality is spot on, and I even like the thicker cut sweet potato fries at this location even better than the hand cut ones at the original.    I always get the original bang bang burger, because it's so classic, but I have gotten rave reviews of their other offerings from friends and family I have taken with me over the years.  The buns are perfect in every way, the ground beef is super high quality, and the bang bang sauce is so tasty I occasionally dip my fries in it!   True parking isn't amazing but it's a teeny walk from the East Blvd light rail stop, and a block from the rail trail.  If you have never been to the original, you owe it to yourself to visit!",

Flavor was strong, but the black bean patties fell apart easily which made this a little messy. The mess was worth it and overall it was tasty. A couple of my friends got the Pimento burger and said it too was delicious, just heavy. I would definitely come here again, probably for lunch instead of dinner.",

    "text": "I had been looking forward to this opening since the Charlotte Agenda first wrote about it. I've been to Bang Bang Burgers and love it and thought a slider option sounded awesome. We scheduled a cheat day from our diet to try it and were very disappointed.   We got 3 slicers each: Pimiento, Sriracha, Fried Mac and Cheese, K-Pop, Blue and Bacon Jam, and Crispy Chicken. There were many problems, the biggest of which was that the meat was dry, overcooked, and flavorless. We asked for them medium rare and they came out medium well. The patties are also incredibly tiny and don't come close to filling the bun. The best ones were the ones that had enough sauce to cover up the bad tasting burger -- the Blue and Bacon Jam, the Pimento, and the K-Pop. The Crispy Chicken was by far the best. The chicken was delicious unlike the beef. The other two were so dry they were almost inedible. We got BBQ and sweet potato chips as our sides. They were both pretty good, but I liked the sweet potato more.   The price for what you get isn't cheap either. Considering the size of the sliders, $15+ is quite a bit to pay (plus half of them have an upcharge).   Considering that they know how to cook a normal burger at their other restaurant, I'm really hoping they are just still working out the kinks for making sliders. If I see reviews start to change, I'd give them another chance. Otherwise I won't be back.",

The Pesto Mayo is amazing! I would buy just that for my apt and put it on chicken, grilled cheese, etc.   The Brussels sprouts were crispy but not burnt and not too salty.",

The guac that comes on the guac cheddar burger is good though!   The burgers do not fill the buns. I think it's a really good concept but needs some extra help. I think having a small menu is smart right now because they need to learn from some of these reviews.   The homemade chips are actually decent, BBQ flavor would be my fav!

I love the salad dressing!  And it comes with hard boiled egg, sweet potatoes, tomato and onion.  Very good and the whole thing is very filling.  Will definitely order again.  The rest of our tables food was equally delicious.  One ordered a burger and one a salmon blt.

So you have some unique burger types like the Seoul with kimchi and Bulgagi beef sauce or more  traditional burgers like the hangover with the egg and potato bacon hash (my personal favorite) or more southern like the pimento burger with pimento cheese and fried pickles.  They also have healthy-ish choices like the burger bowl (like a burger salad) or the quinoa bean burger. Their chips and fries are good. We also always get the cheeseburger egg roll. It is super tasty. I wish the egg roll was bigger. And 3 dollars for the size seems a little pricey, but if you come you have to get one.  We also like the staff. They are friendly and helpful. Refills are self serve and I am ok with that. It's family friendly and it's a good place to just grab a burger and beer with friends.",

My husband and I were looking for something in the South End area that was on the faster side, but still decent for you and good food. I ordered their veggie burger and a side of broccoli (there is an up-charge for this, but I was trying to be healthy and not get fries). My husband got one of the burgers (sorry, I forget), and upgraded to the side of brussel sprouts (also attempting to be healthy, but these were actually cooked in butter, so not so much haha).   The veggie burger is one of my favorites around! It's black bean based and stays together better than most veggie burgers. It does squish out a little while eating, but not to the point of a huge mess. Everything that comes on it is excellent, but you could also get any burger with that patty if you wanted. The broccoli was also steamed to a bright green.. not over cooked or mushy at all.  Can't wait to come back!",

Both my husband and I ordered the Tomatillo Guacamole Burger. I genuinely hope they add this to the regular menu because it was absolutely delicious! Grilled onion, jalapeno, and tomatillo, chopped and then mixed with avocado, cilantro, and lime juice...all over a beef patty with chorizo, pepper jack cheese, and chipotle mayo. I'm still dreaming about this burger!  We had great service and our food arrived fast since we made sure to visit after the lunch rush. I always suggest Bang Bang to friends who are looking for a great place to eat in Charlotte. Looking forward to visiting again!",

We were happy to hear about the south end location, but after mapping, realized it's not much closer than the OG bang bang.  Entering this location there was a sense of pride. Happy seeing the larger dining room. The new decor. All done very well. This business deserves a stand alone building.   The staff is just as lovely as the Elizabeth location. And the food is like always, great. Can't wait to come back. I will leave the owner with this one last thing.  Bang Bang Steele Creek   Think about it!",

    "text": "This.  Place.  Is.  Awesome.    Food:  Delicious.  Perfect. Everything you would want in a burger.  You are doing yourself a wrong if you are in the area and do not go here for your burger.    Drinks:  They have a few beers on tap and sodas.   Staff:  Super friendly with great personalities.  The guy taking the orders had great knowledge of the menu, a welcome relief to someone who is not familiar with their various sauces, etc.  Atmosphere:  They have lovely outdoor tiered seating as well as moderate indoor seating.  It looks pretty new.  It has a trendy, industrial feel to it.  The place is not huge and you WILL be eating close to strangers, so if that bothers you, look elsewhere, especially if you will be dining at peak times.  Personal sidenote:  [keep reading] I will preface it by saying that we were there on a Saturday night at dinner time, so it was, expectantly, super busy.  You order/pay up front, similar to a fast food joint; I do not mind standing in an efficiently-run line, but this was not that sort of line.  I feel like I stood in the same place for ten minutes.  The whole line, probably seven people, took about twenty minutes prior to being able to place our order.  They had two registers, but no way to access the second one without weaving your way through the first one, as well as they only had one person on the registers.  Another person was going down the line taking any beer orders, but that did not help the line move any faster.  When the guy taking my order said it would still be another 20-25 minutes after I placed my order to get my food, I was bummed.  I told the guy I happened to be running late for an event I was attending, which was by no fault of anyone but my own.  I was surprised when the food came out about five minutes later and when I looked over to the order-taking guy in surprise, and he gave me a thumbs up, even while continuing to take other folks' orders.  Obviously he heard the hangry timely-challenged desperation in my voice and satiated that monster and thus allowing me to almost get to my event on time.  I really appreciated that!  I hope to visit them again the next time I am in town and will make sure to give myself plenty of time to enjoy it!  Tip:  Go here!",

It's a fast casual set-up, so you'll order at the counter, take a number, and wait for your food to be served. They have a huge selection of cans of craft beers and about 5 local option on draft. My sister loved that they do \"burger bowls\", so if you're keeping it a little healthier it's no big deal! Any of their burgers can be made a single or double.  Normally I would opt for something healthier, but their burger special looked too good to pass up: The Elvis. Beef burger with munster cheese, tempura banana, banana peppers, bacon, and a peanut butter sauce on a buttery roll. HEAVEN TO ME. It was sweet, salty, vinegary, and meaty. I should've made it a double ;) I had broccoli for a side to balance it out (even if only slightly!) and it was delicious. Our main order taker even gave us some chips so that we could try them fresh out of the frier. So warm and salty. I will absolutely be back.",

    "text": "Finally got around to checking the \"new guy\" in Southend... actually there are a lot of \"new guys\" and I'm falling behind very fast.  I believe the \"bites\" concept has changed so they are offering full burgers here.  They pretty much went \"all in\" with the restaurant decor.  From the ceiling fans that look like farm windmills, to the cattle fence that directs you to the registers, there's definitely no shortage of theme here.  It is definitely an interesting space with the wood and industrial chairs.  There's even a little upstairs \"nook\" with about two tables... maybe for private parties or large groups?  The group would be limited though.... from what I saw, there was a couple up there enjoying their privacy and lift view of the restaurant.  Staff was super friendly and patient as we perused the menu.  It looks like they do a good bit of take out/to go orders as well for the neighborhood.  I had the mushroom and Swiss burger and it came with a generous side of mustard.  The fries were presented in a mini frying basket and the whole thing presented on a wooden tray with handle.  You order at the register and the servers will give you a number to find you in the dining room.    Also ordered an egg roll snack that I split with my friend.  It comes piping hot and split into two with the signature bang bang sauce.  My friends burger had fresh jalapenos on it (sriracha burger) so if you enjoy major heat, I'd recommend that one.  There are two coke machines in the back... looks like they are more compact and a little more user friendly from the \"version 1\" coke machines I'm used to seeing everywhere.  Overall it was a good dining experience.  I'm a fan of the large squirt bottles of ketchup on each table and rolls of paper towels.  There's a nice porch/deck area, however it was raining that day we visited.  Probably my one ding is parking... I guess they share parking with next door The Zepplin so it was a rainy weekday night and the lot was full.... I can't imagine this place on the weekends.  There is street parking but if you are coming in from a different neighborhood, be prepared to walk if the lot is full.  And with all the stuff coming into Tremont, I'm sure the parking situation will just become more challenging.",

    "text": "I'm so surprised I have yet to review Bang Bang Burgers in South End...while I haven't visited the original location in Elizabeth, J & I have frequented this location since it is a nice walk to/from our apartment complex.  I have enjoyed both the beef burger, the chicken burger, and a burger bowl here and I am absolutely obsessed with the brussel sprouts.  The chicken burger is a great alternative to the beef (which is 100% grass fed!!!), and I love the option of a burger in a bowl with lots of delicious salad toppings.  I'm not a huge fan of their sauces, but that's just because I'm not a huge mayo-sauce fan and prefer plain 'ol ketchup and mustard, but J loves the bang sauce, which is 1000-island-esque.  The indoor seating area is great, and we also love the patio when the weather calls for it.  They have a really good gluten free bun, IMO, so if the option calls for that, I always choose it vs. lettuce wrapped.  So solid.",

But curious as to why it is different. Tried pimento burger and it was a whole lot of cheesiness. It was good but my favorite is still the #1, I actually enjoy the flavor of the burger without over powering toppings. Nice location, easy parking. Good vibes!

My go to is usually the Classic or Guacamole burger. But I went with the TNT Burger this time. This one was a little spicier than I thought, especially with the sriracha aioli sauce. I think I might stick with my usual choices but don't steer away if you're more into spicy food!  I also usually go with the sweet potato fries and cheeseburger egg rolls. They're both delicious. The bang bang sauce that comes with the cheeseburger egg roll compliments it perfectly. Well, that sauce will compliment about anything!",

One reason is value at $10 bucks you get a burger and side. I went with thr chips but the hand cut fries arr also goof. Originally I was thinking for a single patty that was steep and then realized it comes with a side which some of the competitors do not offer this. Very reasonable I must say and quality is excellent. I went with the K-pop because it sounded unique. Was a tasty combo of kim-chi and pork belly.  It is counter service but everyone was really nice abd they bring your food out to you on a cutting board.",

Domestic drafts were on special, so I grabbed a 22oz brew and a regular burger with fries.  My wife ordered her standard grilled chicken sandwich and took our number and sat down.  Our food came out hot and well presented - my burger was served gastro pub style on a wood board with the fries in a metal cup.  The patty was thinner than I expected, but someone was cooked perfectly so there was still pink inside.  It was tasty, and the fries were really good.    Really close to a 5-star review, it's a place that I would go back to if we were in the area, but not out of our way to visit.",

    "text": "Bang Bang is A-OK. I wouldn't put it at the top of the burger food chain but it's a necessary dining option amidst all of the breweries and slightly more trendy restaurants in South End. I do believe they've found an awesome yin to their yang with Common Market opening up next door.  I really wish I could've tried them when they were slingin' sliders but, oh well. Fingers crossed that they find a way to re-introduce them as a menu item. Bang Bang is located right next door to Zeppelin and has an outdoor patio with picnic-style tables and a fire pit. There's also plenty of inside seating.  Whether you're dining outside or in, you place your order inside at the counter. The menu is brightly-lit and available above the cashier. I have tried the guacamole, bang bang, and cowboy burgers. My personal favorite is the bang bang burger. It's a classic for a reason! I've usually gone with the regular fries as a side but have had the brussels once. The brussels need to be roasted a little longer and seasoned in order for me to enjoy them as a regular choice of side. They also offer sweet potato fries.  They have alcohol - cans of beer from the local breweries and your normal soft drink options. Once your order is placed, you get a number for your table and your food is brought out to you. Last time I was there, the staff seemed to be confused by a friend's order and took a while bringing out her side. It was handled sort of awkwardly but they did bring out the correct side after plenty of time had surpassed.  Again, not the best but still qualifies as a pretty good burger!",

Funny because The Big Bang is one of my favorite sitcoms with no relation.  I enjoyed the Bang Bang Burger with a thousand island type sauce on the side. It was cooked medium well. I don't like pink on the inside. They cooked it perfectly. It wasn't heavy and hit the spot. My husband enjoyed the Cowboy Burger. His had bacon and a barbecue sauce on the side. Both were a single size about 4-4.5 oz of beef.  Afterwards, we enjoyed a walk back to the hotel along the Light Rail. Enjoy!",

    "text": "We had lunch at Bang Bang Burgers in South End and enjoyed it. This place makes pretty good burgers.  This is the second location of Bang Bang Burgers although it didn't originally start that way. The business opened earlier this year, February 2018, as Bang Bang Bites. Bang Bang Bites specialized in sliders and the concept didn't last long (about a month). Customers wanted burgers and burgers are easier for the kitchen to make, so Bang Bang Bites became Bang Bang Burgers. The first Bang Bang Burgers location is in Elizabeth. This one in South End is located on the same property as the Common Market (same parking lot). There's free parking on-site as well as free parking on the street (no meters).  This is a fast-casual restaurant where you stand in line, order, pay upfront, and wait for your order to be brought to you. Fountain drinks (Coke Freestyle), tea, and water are self-serve. There are taps of beer behind the counter. The space was renovated for Bang Bang. It looks good. The interior has a modern warehouse feel to it with exposed brick and ductwork and industrial-looking windmill ceiling fans. There's plenty of seating. It consists of communal bar-height tables and smaller tables set up against a cow-spotted banquette. There's also an elevated nook in the back. Outside, there's a patio (dog-friendly, I believe) with two levels of seating including umbrella-covered picnic tables with plants for decor. Everything still looked nice and new during our visit.  When we visited, the menu featured eight burgers priced at $9.50 to $10.50 each for single-patty burgers and $12.50 to $13.50 for double-patty burgers. There was also a weekly special burger ($11.50 single, $13.50 double) which we ended up ordering. Bang Bang offers grass-fed beef, gluten-free buns, and black bean patties at additional cost. They have creative burgers like the Guacamole with shaved red onion, grilled corn, guacamole, and ranch and the K Pop with mixed greens, kimchi, braised pork belly, and gochujang mayo (gochujang is a type of Korean red chili paste).  The beef comes from La Frieda Meat Purveyors in New Jersey (where Bang Bang's chef/owner Joseph Huang comes from) and the buns come from Dukes Bread in Charlotte.  Along with burgers, you can get snacks and sides like cheeseburger egg rolls ($3.50) and Brussels sprouts ($4), burger bowls ($13-14 each), and sandwiches ($10.50-12.00). Alcohol includes local beers and cider on draft, canned, and bottled ($4-7 per serving).  I tried a couple burgers:  * Sriracha Burger (single patty, $10) - habernero cheese, fried onion strings, shaved jalapenos, and \"green Sriracha\" * Fried Green Tomato Burger (weekly special, single patty, $11) - avocado ranch, cheddar, fried green tomato, and arugula  And my buddy got the Bang Bang Burger:  * Bang Bang Burger (single patty, $9.50) - American cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, \"Bang sauce\"  Both burgers came with a side of hand-cut fries. Everything was presented beautifully on wooden serving boards. Each serving of fries was lined with paper and placed inside a mini fryer basket. The burgers were served open-faced with sauces, such as the green Sriracha, on the side.  As a spicy food lover, I thought the Sriracha Burger could have been much spicier. For me, it was mild in terms of spice. Despite the lack of heat, I still thought the burger was quite tasty. The habanero cheese was thick and rich and the fried onion strings were wispy and delightfully crispy. I'm not really sure what was up with the green Sriracha. Was it housemade or store-bought? I liken it to a spicy mustard. It wasn't bad.  The Fried Green Tomato Burger was great though messy to eat. This burger had a lot of going on with two layers of avocado ranch, a thick slice of fried green tomato, and an almost heaping amount of cheese, not to mention the burger patty itself plus a topping of fresh arugula. This was a very flavorful burger that hit you with a variety of tastes and textures. If it's available during your visit, I recommend it.  As far as the actual burger patties and buns went, I thought they were A-OK. They were good quality, but I wouldn't say they were exceptional or memorable. The patties and buns were standard size with the patties nicely cooked and the buns lightly grilled.  My friend enjoyed his Bang Bang Burger. I have no clue what was in the Bang sauce. It looked like Thousand Island dressing.  Service was terrific. We showed up on a Friday around 1:15pm and the restaurant wasn't busy. We didn't have to wait in line and our orders came out quick. The staff was nice.",

That however is not their fault. We ordered, the service was quick and friendly, I had a regular burger with an order of fries. They came to the table very quickly I asked for the fries to be cooked krisp and they were and delicious. the guy that brought the food even asked us if there was anything else you could get us. That's kind of rare anymore. The burger was delicious as well but very greasy. as a matter of fact and I'm sure it's because I don't eat a lot of Grease, I had a upset stomach the next morning. But again that's not their fault. Prices were reasonable, I definitely would go again. But not on kids eat free night which by the way is Tuesday night.",

And the brought us both 2 different burgers . Then forgot the bacon and only had 3 small pickles. Also the food itself was pretty average and maybe below average the fries were super soggy with no flavor and absolutely nothing special about the burgers. Wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for a top quality burger.",

The bites did need some work (cheese just wasn't melting). That said though, I really appreciate that Joe took a risk and tried something new. The concept was fun, staff was friendly, and the pimento bite was awesome. I'm personally looking forward to the TNT burger hopefully coming to south end now, but I hope this doesn't stop Joe from being innovative in the future.",

First, things were coming soon-beer(was not happy about this. I really wanted a beer with my sliders) and specials- even though there probably wouldn't have been one on a Saturday. Menu is sort of small, which coincidentally is the same as the sliders. For me, two bites and it was gone. Even my wife was a little disappointed in how small they were. Sliders tasted fine. The fried mac and cheese slider was my favorite. I was a little disappointed with the Sriracha slider as it didn't seem to have a lot of flavor. Sliders come with BBQ chips which were good. I did notice they seem to have these ready to just put on plates which made me worry they have be old but mine were good. Personally, I thought it was overpriced for the amount of food you get. Two sliders was $11, three for $15 and that did not include a drink. We will give it another try maybe after beer is finally being sold.",

With that being said if I could give the food a separate grade it would be 3 stars. Hence my average rating of 4 stars. Today I had a revelation....I hate grass-fed ground beef! It has this funky taste that I can't put my finger on but for me it sucks! I consider myself a burger connoisseur and I can't believe how bad the grass makes the burger taste! Now I know why I hated the burgers at other Charlotte restaurants. (Dogwood, Porter's House, WholeFoods burger bar (South Park)). The fries were cooked perfectly except had little to no salt on them. My wife enjoyed her black bean burger bowl. As nice as this place is and I know it's popular I will not be returning. My favorite burger in Charlotte is still Bad Daddy's.",
