The Food we ate: -Love how the salad was crispy fresh...but the salad dressing ruined it...ick. -The calamari looked different (like puffballs), but they actually tasted better than I expected. The sauce that came with it complemented it. -The summer roll and its sauce was ok...not that good, but not that bad either. -My teriyaki chicken was a bit a bit dry with very little sauce on it. If they added a bit more sauce, it would've been perfect. It still tastes good though. The veggies that came with it was perfect. -My hubby's basil beef tasted like a regular stir fry. And let's just say we shared my teriyaki chicken instead.",

The veggies were cooked to perfection, the meats tasty and plentiful, and the staff extremely attentive, even on a busy night. Our new favorite place!",

    "text": "Last Saturday my husband and I were \"cruising the town\" looking for a bite to eat. We noticed about 5 or 6 different restaurants along that side of the Arboretum. Most of the places had their menus on the outside and nothing really appealed to us. This place kind of had a cool looking sign so we walked in and asked to see a menu. The ladies at the front of the restaurant were so welcoming. We decided to go ahead and stay for dinner. My husband ordered a ying ling... and they served it in a \"COLD GLASS\"  how awesome is that?! For an appetizer we got the crab ragoon, which I have to say was excellent. Normally from take-out Chinese places it's usually frozen and deep fried on ordering. These weren't the usual triangle crab ragoons that you see at most places, but the blossom ones. Super Yummy! They serve them with some duck sauce.   For entrees he got Mee Goreng which he loved. I thought it tasted like there was some dill in it. Not a big dill fan myself, but he loved it. I got my favorite which of course is a Pad Thai. Very yummy. Their Pad Thai is very plain though not a lot of extras. The food was delicious and we'll be back again for sure, but I LOVED the service!!   Those ladies bust their butts to make sure you have a great meal. You have to love eating at a place that values their patrons that much.",

It's cozy and comfortable and the servers are so helpful.  You can tell they love explaining their dishes to newbies.    My hubby and I had the Malay Roll - it's seasoned ground chicken rolled up in tofu skin and deep fried - it's served with a sweet-chili sauce and it was delicious.  It reminds me of a Chinese-Filipino dish, called Kikiam, I grew up with and it brought back some really nice memories.  We also had the Hainan Chicken  - it's poached chicken served at room temperature with the most amazing rice! And last but not least, we had the Char Kway Teow   - pan fried noodles - oh my - so good.  Can't wait to go back! And their hours fit folks who tend to eat late - they close at 11:00 PM Mondays -Thursdays, at 12:00 Midnight on Fridays and 10:00 PM on Sundays.",

Creative Loafing gave a nod and recently the Charlotte Observer included it in a map of ethnic eats (just a side note: the map's a fun little resource for finding foods of every background). The digs are nice, and while the accolades are good, I didn't find it to be something to write home about.  We got Char Kway Teow (pan-fried flat noodles) with vegetables, which had a deep pork flavor, topped off with grilled vegetables and bean sprouts. I'd love to find out how to make it. Thai food fans will like the mee goreng, a spicy noodle dish with chicken. It's topped with chopped peanuts, has a nice crisp taste from garlic and bean sprouts, and leaves your lips buzzing with spice. I liked a few bites, but it was kind of oily, and my eating subconscious kicked in: \"Mr. Werner, there is too much oil here.\"  The service was the best part: the staff were very friendly and chatted with regulars who stopped in to say hi. I also really liked this giant painting of a Malay town on the wall to the left of the entrance.  I'd like to try out Cuisine Malaya, the other Malaysian restaurant on the list. I liked what I tried, but I want to seek out an even better option.",

The wait staff is tremendously nice and helpful.  The dishes came out prepared very carefully, right down to the elegant floral garnishes. If you like Asian fusion, their food is incredible.

We also had pad thai which was just ok and Mongolian beef which was fantastic. My issue is that we had a party of 3 and we used a $5 coupon and they wrote in an 18% tip on our receipt before they brought it to us. The service was great and we would have tipped at least that much but it was not disclosed anywhere that there was an automatic gratuity. It's a reason not to go back as they are deceptive in the way they charge and that usually carries over to being deceptive in other areas of their business!",

The wife doesn't like spicy food as much as myself, but isn't afraid of it anymore.  The wife and I started with Roti Canai. The tortilla-like bread was fresh and warm. The menus says crispy, but I didn't get that. It was more like a tortilla fresh from the griddle to me. Good, but unremarkable. The curry sauce was delicious. I'd gladly eat a bowl of it as a soup, in fact, I did just that once we were out of pancake to spoon it onto. I'd definitely get it again, though I'd ask for it to be spicy.  I got the Pad Himmgpan with chicken for dinner. A nice mix of meat and veggies. It's not a wet dish, so all the flavor is on the food, not leaving much for your rice. The flavor was great, the menu said it was spicy, but the spice was moderate at best, the only bit of heat coming from the jalapeno slices cooked in to the veggie mix and the non-edible red peppers. Normally I'd ask for it hotter if I went back, but the flavor of this dish was so good I'd be afraid of any additional heat coming from the addition of something that would throw that flavor off. The chicken in my dish was exceptional. I'm pretty harsh on chicken in Asian cooking, as it often comes off rubbery and tasteless. This chicken was tender and flavorful. I liked this dish enough that I will have a hard time not getting it when I go back.  My wife got the Curry Laksa, an enormous bowl of noodles and veggies in the curry sauce our app was in, though it seemed less spicy. She enjoyed it, though the sauce was probably too thin to carry much flavor to the noodles. If she got it again, she might skip the noodles entirely.  The service was fast and friendly and the food was good. I definitely want to drag my wife back and try it again.",

I had they're Roti Canai and it's excellent. I also had decided to try their Mongolian Beef. I am used to getting it which is really good from PF Changs, yet they beat them out by a landslide!! My picky son who barely eats anything loved their Pho. This place has good food and I do recommend it!!",

Not much depth to the flavor.  Curry gravy, chicken and cubed potatos.  Not that interesting.  Finally, we had the Mee Goreng, an Indian noodle dish.  Again, not much depth to the flavor.  We had ours with chicken.  There were pieces of fried tofu in there.  I enjoyed this dish but it was not that interesting.  This was the best dish of the evening.  Finished with the mango and sticky rice.  This was so-so as well.  Would go back and try the soup and other authentic malaysian dishes but was pretty disappointed that i was not more flavorful tonight.",

I have eaten here a couple of times in the past - it was never great but a meh type of place where you can do a take-out when you are lazy to go anywhere else... But last night the food was horrible.. I would not even eat it if it were free food... Roti Kanai was horrible .. the roti was hard as a rock and the curry was so like yellow liquid... same thing with Roti Telur.. they didn't even fry it well... you can taste the rawness.. the pot-stickers were not steamed right - you could not only taste but see the raw dough !!! Beef Rendang - that came as a nightmare.. so spice.. no flavor.. as if somebody made it and poured a glass of water on top it !!!  I am so disappointed with the food ...this was my last time there..   I should have guessed that this place has gone downhill when I went to pick up dinner on a Friday night and there were just 2 people in the bar and none sitting and dining !!!  Save your money and go someplace else !",

What with all that ketchup (?) it was doused in!  I so wanted to like this place, being a big fan of Malaysian cuisine. I will probably give it another shot because lots of other things on the menu looked promising and the family running it though understaffed did their best to accommodate all our requests. Hopefully, they have some hidden gems in that extensive menu and I will find them soon.",

No need to repeat what's already been said, except that this place just jumped on a top of my list of Asian foods.

This is where they lost stars from me. It was presentable but it came out within 3 minutes of ordering it. The broccoli was ice cold like the took it from the freezer and forgot to warm it up. The rice was super sticky and the one good item I had was the sesame chicken. The waitress forgot to bring the appetizer even after the food arrived and when reminded she looked back at her written list to confirm. It's a nice quick place to go to with mediocre food.

I don't think I've ever had green beans as the main vegetable but I'm definitely going to be rethinking that! It was so good. My hubs had the teriyaki chicken and he only reason I'm knocking this to 4 instead of 5 was his chicken breast was a little bit dry.

    "text": "Just moved to Charlotte last month. I was so excited when I found there is Malaysian restaurant in Charlotte area. Whenever I go to Malaysian restaurant, I always order Char Kuey Teow. It's a popular noodle dish in Malaysia. When I lived in Raleigh, I have been so disappointed because good restaurants in Triangle area that offered that noodle dish were closed (Fortune Palace, Penang, & Merlion). With a great expectation, I decided to make a trip to Malaya Kitchen for lunch last week.   The restaurant is located in the busy shopping center. Kind of remind me with Cameron Village in Raleigh. The waitress was very nice & polite. I ordered Char Kuey Teow, & I was so disappointed. It was just Ok. The authentic Char Kuey Teow usually comes with shrimp, squid, sliced of Chinese sausage, fish cake, chives, & bean sprouts. Mine only came with beef, bean sprouts, & scallions. There was no taste belachan in that dish, which is the key ingredient in Char Kuey Teow.   Sighhhh.... I guess I have to make a trip to Atlanta if I want to enjoy delicious Char Kuey Teow. The service was good though. I give them a second chance, so I will come back to try other dishes next time.",

Now, I know NOTHING about Malaysian food. In fact, I'm not even sure I know where Malaysia is on our big planet. But after eating this meal, I need to find out more.  I stuck to the specials menu and ordered the \"Malaya Roll\" which turned out to be ground chicken in a pastry roll that was fried to a crunchy goodness and served with a sweet chilli sauce. I ate all of it and then dipped the garnish cucumbers into the sauce too.  For my main, the Hong Kong Duck Soup caught my eye. When it arrived, it was a massive vat of dark colored broth with noodles, veggies and probably half of a duck sliced into bits. It took a little while until it cooled enough to eat but when it did, OMG yum. Deep flavor in the broth and the noodles were just perfect al dente and the bok choi was nice and tender. The duck. Oh, the duck. Tasty, meaty and all too many more adjectives that need to go here to describe a great meal. Check the picture I posted!  I opted to skip dessert, instead finishing the Chinese beer I had ordered.  Great service sitting at the bar. My only complaint is not their fault - my cell phone could barely get a 2G signal. :-(",

I placed an order over the phone for Mee Goreng noodles without carrots or bean sprouts, among 4 other items; the manager took my order and repeated it back to me, and I thought I heard Mee Goreng noodles, and I repeated it back one more time. We pick up the food and drive home, and I got noodles but not Mee Goreng noodles. I call the restaurant and tell them that I got the wrong item and the same manager proceeds to tell me that I am wrong and she knows I didn't order Mee Goreng and that it would be too much trouble to remake the item (I wasn't even asking for my money back, just simply for her to exchange out the noodles I received for the noodles I ordered). I work in the restaurant industry and I know better than anyone that the customer is not in fact always right, so even if I misheard her when she repeated it back to me, it was an honest mistake, and the fact that she refused to remake the item, ensured that my husband I was will never ever return. It's too bad because they lost customers forever over an $10 item.",

The staff is kind and responsive, food is made quickly and to order. The environment is welcoming and homey, and it's never too loud. I always get the crispy sesame tofu and usually the samosas as an appetizer and I'd recommend both. If you get the samosas though, don't expect the big, potato-and-veggie ones you'll get at real samosa places, but they're small and crispy and come with a sweet sauce that's delicious.

    "text": "I have been coming to Malaya Kitchen for nine years now, and even after all that time I can still say that this is one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. The reason for this is consistency; every item that I have ordered here has been amazing. Even Sesame Chicken, the most basic asian dish, tastes different from any other. Allow me to explain.  Simply put, everything they serve at Malaya is amazing. I have visited this restaurant about fifteen times in 2018 alone. I cannot imagine the overall number of visits made throughout the last nine years. The food is ready and served within ten minutes of ordering, every time. That may be a concern, as that is quicker than McDonalds, but the quality never falters. The interior decor and ambience could be better, but food should be the only reason why anyone would want to eat out.   Pricing is relatively moderate during dinner time, but I would recommend coming here from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. during their Lunch Special period. During these hours, most items on the menu are priced around $8, which includes a menu item with your choice of white or brown rice and a house salad with an amazing ginger dressing.   I have tried every item on the main menu, and I can say that you cannot go wrong with whatever choice you make. As always, there are some dishes that are better than others. My personal favorite is the Mongolian Beef served with white rice. The Mongolian Beef is prepared very tender, with a hint of sugar. This makes the beef also a bit crispy, which paired with the tender beef is such a delight. Overall, the taste of Mongolian Beef is the perfect blend of sweet and savory that draws me to order it every time. My second favorite dish is the Beef Rendang, with is a curry dish with an excellent sauce. Just have toothpicks handy.  Among the desert options, I would go with the fried ice cream. It consists of a big ball of vanilla bean ice cream surrounded by a crispy brown crust that makes an excellent pairing. It also costs around $5.25, so you must really want dessert to pay up.   As you can see, I would highly recommend Malaya Kitchen. It just amazes me how consistent a restaurant can be with the amount of dishes that they serve. Even so, having been a regular for nine years and seeing how amazing it has been every time, it truly is amazing. It's one of my Jude's Joints Certified Restaurants (another way to say it's one of my favorites).",

Some of the spices are in there, but not all, so your beef rendang will not taste like it should.  It tastes okay--it's not bad, but it's more like a stir-fry imitation of what the dish should be, not the original, and it shows.   The servers were friendly, the place is clean, the prices seem fair, the location is convenient with lots of parking, and we were waited on promptly.  No complaints.  The decor is standard to any Chinese restaurant.  And they have a nice-sized bar in there, which is good.  People in the restaurant business are on their feet all day and work really hard, so I don't like to leave less-than-positive reviews.

Luckily, a little sign on the door led me to its sister restaurant (aka Malaya Kitchen aka heaven). I quickly looked up Malaya Kitchen on yelp (of course) and that's where the adventure began! I had a couple of foodie friends in town and this was the perfect opportunity to try it out.   foodie friends + late lunch + first time = family style!  We ordered (takes a deep breathe) roti canai (malaysian crispy pancake and curry to dip), beef rendang (malaysian staple: tender beef pieces marinated in exotic spices and coconut), sarang burong (ring shaped fried taro topped with shrimp, chicken and veggies in brown sauce), curry laksa (egg and rice noodles in coconut milk curry) and mee goreng (stir fry egg noodle in red mild sauce with mixed veggies). Rarely does this happen, but I literally recommend EVERYTHING that we ate. Craziest part? Dare I say I enjoy Malaya Kitchen more than I've ever enjoyed Cuisine Malaysia (I KNOW, I'm sorry!). Every time I write a yum review, I reminisce the meal all over again... and now I'm craving Malaysia food!",

For entree we got the Curry Laksa -- beautiful!! It had okra and tomatoes, squash, broccoli, onions, and tofu. I didnt care for the tofu (next time I will omit), but everything in the bowl tasted lovely. The broth was not as spicy as I like, but the waiter kindly obliged my request for chili flakes.

Even though they are a small restaurant looking almost like a Chinese takeaway I was blown away by how clean the tables and the whole restaurant generally was. It seemed family run as lot of the waitresses were conversing in their native language. Our waiter was a gentleman and he took great care of us! We ordered roti canai for appetizers. It was my goto at all Malaysian restaurants. For the main dish, I got the chili chicken stir fry and my friend got a curry laksa.  As we were just done with appetizers and moving on to our entrees, I had about a quarter of still remaining. I would have imagined the waiter pulling away the plate before setting our entree plates, but to prove me wrong, the waiter suggested to keep the remaining roti and use it as a wrap with the stir fry entree! I love when waiters could read our minds!   The chilli chicken stir fry entree was magical. The chicken pieces literally melted in my mouth! The texture, the softness, I still don't know how they cooked that. Not at all leathery or chewy like any regular chicken. The only downside was, there were more beans than the chicken. I would have expected more. The curry laksa that my friend got was huge containing a whole lot of vegetables. The vegetables is another story - so fresh and well cooked!   I would love coming back to this restaurant to try out their more awesome dishes and never to forget the hospitality of the waiters!",

It was good but had a strong onion taste, definitely don't have it if you're on a date! I ordered the jalapeno beef lunch special with egg fried rice. This was AMAZING!!! The jalapenos had been grilled before putting them in the dish and that took it to a whole new level!! It was delicious! I highly recommend it. In fact I've been dreaming about it this whole week because I want to go back for it!!  They also have this HUGE lucky bamboo in the entrance that is gorgeous!!!",

They have booths and tables and the dining room has a section off to the side to the left of the dining space as you walk in.  I believe they also have a bar.  Service was quick and great.  We didn't lack for anything. Took our orders as soon as we were ready and refilled our waters promptly.    My husband and I ordered roti canai, chicken wonton soups,  summer rolls and chicken curry. The roti canai is really good. Try it once at least.  It's a tiny bowl of dipping curry with a very well made roti bread pancake. The roti was perfect and the dipping sauce was good. I would have loved some potatoes/onions in there or something. That would have really put it over the top.  The chicken wonton soups we're delish!  My husband and I literally said it was the best wonton soup we had in Charlotte so far and will definitely come here when we are sick and can't make our own soup/want soup, etc.   The summer rolls were ok but we weren't crazy about them.  They weren't bad by any means though.  The chicken curry was also good but not what we expected.   Next time,  I will definitely be ordering laksa.  Sounds like that is the way to go with entree.   Would definitely recommend this place.  The bill for 2 roti canai,  2 chicken wonton soups, summer rolls,  and 1 curry chicken entree was 30$. Not bad considering the experience was pleasant and the food was tummy.",

    "text": "How did I not come here b4??? A keeper for sure.  Tho the Hainanese rice seemed oily, it had a taste I could not pinpoint that tempted me to order more to go...garlic jasmine rice with a chewy texture, not dry. Mmmm.   The Sarong Barong was served in a crispy taro bowl which our happy server snipped into bite sized pieces in front of us. Lots of different veges with shrimp and chicken cooked in a sweet, but not too sweet, soy sauce-wine base. Loved that it was not salty like most Asian restaurants.   I couldn't pass up an even more tastier dish of Belacan (shrimp paste which is reminiscent of fish sauce). Served with okra and chicken for my dish but also available with green beans, beef, or shrimp. I'll definitely order this again. Now I must find a Belacan dish recipe .   It's bn a while since receiving such doting service. From beginning to end, it reminded me of restaurants of days past. We were tended to meticulously from chopsticks to even being asked if we wanted our second bowl of white rice brought out to be added to the leftover take home. Most servers wouldn't bother.   I hope to try other dishes here. I'm sure I'll be surp  08-19-18 After Crazy Rich Asian I thought of Musashi but waiting to be seated n seeing tables not served made us come here which is closer to where we need to go rt after. ((())) We sat rt away n order was taken rt away. Sure I still love the fat, fresh sashimi at Musashi but I love belacha  12/01/18 Let's see. We came here 11/25/18 n I forgot to post. I always forget. And, we're here tonight too. Can't get enough of the Hainan Rice, I'm guessing. Tho, I've bn realizing why everything's so tasty. They use a lot of salt.  I keep forgetting to ask them for less salt. My bad. So remember, ask too cuz u will be thirsty. I drank two glasses of water n I'm sure I'll be drinking more at home.   Didn't enjoy the tofu satay appetizer since it didn't hv any distinguishable taste but fried tofu. Didn't enjoy the breaded calamari appetizer cuz it was served with thousand island dressing. Was hoping that it would be a Malaysian sauce of some sort.  The Hainan Chicken onion-ginger sauce was so tasty poured all over but it was full of salt. My bad, I know. Sigh. The Hainan Rice was salty salty but so delicious. Ok, after td I'm eating more vegetarian meals",

The main dish was preceded by an iceberg lettuce salad with ginger dressing that tasted very strange.  I couldn't eat it and I normally love ginger dressing on anything.   I don't know what happened here. The mango chicken was good, but came with steamed broccoli on the plate that was not even luke warm.  I will give them a pass on this because I really enjoyed the mango chicken.  I didn't  remember the mango sauce being as thick and sweet, but what's not to love about thick and sweet?   The iced tea didn't taste as fresh as it should have and there was no Sweet and Low, my preferred sweetener.  The service was good.  The atmosphere was perfect for conversation with my friend, Sam.

    "text": "Okay so I live practically behind this restaurant and late Sunday night we were going to see Iron Man 3 at the Cinebarre and we were too early. So instead of waiting we decided to eat at one of the local places. Malaya Kitchen had amazing reviews so that's where we ended up. Since we didn't want to eat too much or take too much time we decided to try 3 of their appetizers. We had the Malay (Chicken) Satay; pot stickers; and the Malay Roll.  So first things first the pot stickers were just okay. They were too under cooked for my taste. I like a good sear on mine and these did not have that. They were large and well stuff (the filling has chicken not pork) but again just okay for me. It ranked in the middle for me as far as the dishes go.  I didn't really want to order the Malay Roll but my friend wanted to try them... he however didn't read the description very well and didn't realize they were wrapped in tofu skin. I'm not a tofu fan, like at all, but I decided I'd give it a try as I'm always open to new things.  He really liked them, I however did not!! The sauce that came with them was good though, actually all of the sauces with each dish were amazing. First turn off was how it looked (really unappetizing although I won't tell you exactly what I thought it looked like haha). Otherwise it just wasn't something I liked, but like I said my friend really liked it so it's purely a subjective point of view. They didn't make it poorly I just don't have the taste for it. Lastly was the Malay Satay which is probably the best I've had in a long LONG time. It was by far both of our favorite dish!  The staff was extremely nice and attentive especially considering we came in an hour before they were closing.  I will definitely be coming back to try out their main dishes and re-review!!",

This place is the \"sister\" restaurant to Cuisine Malaya in downtown near CPCC. So the menu is VERY similar, minus the sushi. Honestly, I heard the sushi is VERY good there, but I have only tried it once (and it was good). I cannot keep from ordering teh main dishes- and these are almost all the same at Malaya Kitchen, as Cuisine Malaya. Great food and service. So happy to be able to get their good Malasian food close to home!! Try the Char Kway Teow (like Chow Fun), one of my favorites. Oh, and the crispy or Curry duck!!",

I love having a neighborhood joint that can always be depended on to satiate my cravings for char kway teow, curry, and belacan sauce.  Malaysian food is an amalgam of Thai, Chinese, and Indian influences and Malaya does all of these dishes very well.  Tip: if you want to crank up the heat ask for a side of belacan sauce.  Add it to everything if you can stand the pungent, spicy, shrimpy hotness.  It will give you special powers.  Or just really funky breath and a sheen of sweat on your brow.  Either way, it's good.    Try: chicken meatballs, roti canai, tom yum mee hoon, chili garlic duck, mee siam, curry laksa, char kway teow  If its on their specials menu, the spicy stir fried clams with chicken is a crazy fusion of flavors and texture.  It's awesome.  Order it.   This is a small, casual place with friendly servers.  Inexpensive, consistently great food.",

I wasn't feeling very adventuresome when it came time to order dinner, so I just got an order of chicken pad thai.  It was good, but not the best pad thai I've ever had. 3 stars. (Locally, I prefer the Thai House or Thai Orchid for this dish.)  David had the coconut shrimp, which is breaded and served with your choice of brown or white rice. It also comes with a side of veggies - broccoli, carrots, etc.  The veggies were lightly sauteed and not overcooked.  His was definitely the more exciting of the two dishes, visually as well as in terms of taste. 5 stars.   I would definitely like to come back and try this place again.  I have heard that they have other dishes that are not available on the \"standard menu\"   and I will  definitely ask about that on my next visit!   Service was fast and efficient. 4 stars.   I thought the prices were average - appetizers ranged in price from $2.95 - 7.95.  As for the entrees, you can find a lot of options in the $9 - $13 range, but they have several specialty dishes that run between $14- $18 each - certainly reasonable prices for dinner.",

I will definitely say this, I will drive the 14 miles to eat there any time. The noodle soup that I ate made me weak in the knees, it was THAT good. Also, usually when you tell a restaurant you would like it EXTRA spicy, they wimp out and bring you something vaguely resembling spicy, but not this place. We said make it super spicy and the waitress said, \"how about medium?\" She talked us into going medium and bringing more chili sauce in case it wasn't hot enough. Thankfully we listened. Medium is PERFECT, and by that I mean very spicy! We loved it!  Amazingly wonderful food, exceptionally friendly and attentive wait staff and seriously very reasonable prices. We will go back a million times, we were THAT pleased.",

    "text": "Oh, Malaya Kitchen. How in the world have I passed by your doors for so long after dwelling, eating and shopping in and around the Arboretum for so long? Made it in after finding another restaurant was closed on a Sunday afternoon. Boy, oh boy, am I glad they were closed! These guys are on my culinary map for good.   A quaint, low-lit dining room with a few tables, bench/booth-ish seats and a full bar. We made it in around 1:30pm and were seated immediately.   For you soda drinkers, know that if you order a coke, you'll get a 12oz can with a cup of ice. Kind of a bummer, but I guess it's better that limit the intake to one per meal.   We started out with the Roti Telur. \"Pancake\" style app with egg, onions and peppers served with an incredible curry dipping sauce. There are a few potatoes in the curry sauce. Like little starch boats floating in a delicious stream of Malaysian happiness. That good. Each bite was perfect as it was drenched with the curry sauce and a little added sriracha. I saved the curry sauce for the rest of the meal!  My wife had the Stir Fried Okra and Belacan Sauce. Served with white or brown rice. The sauce was spicy and smoky. It had a hint of fruitiness. Kind of difficult to pinpoint but each bite was intriguing. The veggies were aplenty among the rice and sauce.   I ordered the Char Kway Teow. Malaysian pan fried noodles with red onions and bean sprouts. I ordered it with chicken. WHOA. Smoky, tender noodles with so much chicken in each bite, I'd thought there wouldn't be any left for anyone else to order! I added the remaining curry sauce to my entire plate and couldn't have been happier. Whoever discovered this flavor profile deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. I cleaned my plate.   Our server was so helpful and described each dish and how it was made. Very nice and so happy!   The prices are very, very fair for lunch. We ate for just over $20. Can't go wrong in that department.   Thanks, Malaya Kitchen. We'll be back soon and very soon. Cheers!",

A bay leaf relative - but more anisey, bitier, different. An awesome, strange nuance I always stick in my curry laksa but not to be found at our only other Malaysian joint. Made my little day, seeing that leaf, all scenting my curry with odd, tasty flava.  Roti was good, if standard. Hainanese rice on the burner here, but veggies beware - chicken stock abounds.   Service was comfy and attendant. If I lived closer, I'd be here regularly, but even leaves of Salam won't get my belly to agree to a 30 minute drive when the craving for curry hits...alas.",
