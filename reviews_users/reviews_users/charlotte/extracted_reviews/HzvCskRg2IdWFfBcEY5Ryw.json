Today I get the same salad and I knew when I picked it up it wasn't made the same so I go to see what its showing as the ingredients in it and the kale was missing. The baby kale was in it but not the kale. When I brought it to the attention of the young lady ( not sure if she was the manger) she said it only comes with baby kale I said well the sign says baby kale, cranberries and kale again. She said it's a typo. So if on your menus and your order board it's a typo then correct it as there is a big difference between baby kale and kale and I know how I had it the last time. Salad tasted totally different.  Chicken salad was loaded with mayonnaise. Not a great lunch today.",

The real test is down the line if those same employees are as friendly and courteous as Opening Day.   We arrived early expecting long lines, but we were actually the first customers in the place with everyone else awaiting a GRAND OPENING RIBBON CUTTING CEREMONY. Ally who was very friendly and helpful made our experience wonderful!   The place is very nice and the decor is simple yet original. The menu isn't big, but it's sufficient and the food was delicious! We had the Chicken Biscuit of course with tater tots and it did not disappoint. The peach sweet tea was so good I think I had like 3 refills! They also have a unique and refreshing drink called, \"Aqua Fresca\" which is as refreshing and delicious as it sounds! It's Non-Alcoholic.   For new customers they gave out these beautiful mugs and Ally provided the Birthday Girl with complimentary Beignets which were remarkable! Accompanied with a special Coffee dipping sauce.   We will definitely return and highly recommend.",

The Chicken Holler includes fried chicken, cheddar and pickles on a biscuit. I opted for medium. Medium is the mildest of 3 flavors. FYI the hottest is called \"Make em Holler\" lol. I also had cheddar grits as a side. I have to say this before I forget. Holler and Dash is only open from 7am to 2pm  so if you are looking for a late night fix this is not the place to go. If you are looking for Weekend morning breakfast or brunch then yes this is your place! Now back to the regular review. The staff is always friendly and smiling. They are willing to explain the menu to you if you've never been. The food is done in a timely manner. Definitely worth a shot!",

Impressed with the brand partners that they listed.  Flavor combination was on point. Sadly, the food was disappointing. Biscuit was cold and tasted like it had been made several hours prior, if not the day before. Chicken portion was SMALL!!  Like barely 3 oz, if that--and that included the breading. Grits side was cold. For $9.50, I expected a LOT more. :(",

    "text": "We came for brunch time this morning at around 10am. The line was almost out the door. We were greeted at the front door by a member of the staff who welcomed us and handed us a menu. We stood in line for about 10 minutes.   As we stood in line we had the opportunity to review the menu. It has a lot of options for biscuit sandwiches, salads, grit bowls, and coffee.   Once you get closer to the front you see a display with items that they are selling tshirts, mugs, dog treats.   They had agua Fresca in a carafe for purchase right between the registers. They had two open cashiers which helped with the lines. Given that it's done through an iPad it wouldn't hurt if they added a third (at the beginning while this place is hot and wildly popular). They carried local kombucha and had cold brew on tap.   I ordered the shaved Brussels sprouts salad (shaved Brussels, dried cranberries, apples, and pecorino cheese. I asked them to hold the cheese and add roasted chicken (it's an extra charge to add the protein).   I also ordered a side biscuit. You get a choice of raspberry or blackberry jam.   My husband ordered the smokin turkey club. It looked great.   We ordered a little unconventional here - but we wanted to try the restaurant and still eat healthy. I love that it was possible here!   The salad was good! I thought they went a little light on extra protein. Especially considering you have to pay extra for it. Also, I wish there as an extra crunch in the salad, like a toasted pecan or almond. Just a thought!   The biscuit... was great!!! Large and fluffy with layers --- my favorite!   There is a major focus on locally sourced ingredients. Everything tastes fresh.   I liked that there was a decent sized seating area. The booths for up to 6 people which is really nice.   There is a little bit of outdoor seating - but it was too cold to sit in it when we went.   The decor is really sweet ... lots of sunshine yellow, white and wood. I felt bright and even though you were eating biscuits and fried chicken there was something fresh and happy about the space. Is that weird? Maybe -- but it really had a fresh new feel!!  Another great addition to the ever growing CLT restaurant scene!",

It comes with sorghum syrup which really overpowered the other ingredients. It came with tater tots that tasted like they were not freshly made. We were extremely disappointed with the chicken and cheese biscuit. The breading was extremely thick; the actual chicken was paper thin. The pickles were thicker than the chicken meat. Barely a chicken biscuit in my opinion. The cheese grits were delicious.  This restaurant also serves an absurd amount of plastic - our sides came in plastic disposable cups on a ceramic plate; the drinking cups were disposable plastic; the ketchup was pre-measured in plastic with lids. So much waste!   Overall, really disappointed since it had such high reviews.",

Once you order, things go a little quicker. They have good coffee too, I believe it is pure intentions which is super popular around the Charlotte area.  My biggest pain point were the sides.

My friend and I both ordered the Kickback chicken biscuit with the charred corn salad as our side. Needless to say our taste buds were overjoyed with the balance of the goat cheese and pepper jelly. The chicken itself was also very well seasoned.   An important note is that the charred corn salad isn't mayo-based. It's actually greek yogurt instead which makes it a little healthier but still so flavorful!   The biscuit itself was moist and there was enough left after eating the chicken to enjoy with one of the spreads available. We tried the raspberry, blackberry, and the pepper jelly. The raspberry and blackberry are more like preserves than jam if that matters to you.   The caramel latte served as a nice finish to my breakfast. While the focus isn't on coffee the foam art was a very pleasant surprise. This may have been my first visit but it's certainly not my last.",

One that just opened in our area called the Holler & Dash has to be one of my new favorites. It is a breakfast & lunch only restaurant. They serve anything from salads to chicken biscuit sandwiches. My favorite would have to be their CHICKEN HOLLER it is fried chicken, cheddar, pickles  and either their medium, hot, or make 'em holler on a biscuit. I personally liked there medium because it was a little spicer than you would think. They have many different sandwiches and sides to choose from. I personally loved the fried green tomatoes. Instead of them giving you one or two, they give you three, which is awesome and a big portion for a side. I also really enjoyed their pickles. The pickles had a punch which was actually delicious. They also sell them by the jar with the cutest mugs ever (Planning on getting both). Holler and Dash is a quick and affordable breakfast/lunch restaurant that is open at 7 AM to 2 PM. You can even order online! The last thing I wanted to add is the fact that they get all of their ingredients from local farms in the south. So although they have 7 stores now, you are still eating locally and supporting local farmers. GO check it out!",

    "text": "Came to Charlotte to explore a new city with my boyfriend and needed some fuel before we hit the road this morning. A couple of places sparked our interests but we just couldn't pass up chicken biscuits. Literally the best decision we made. As soon as we walked in we were welcomed by the nicest lady, I'm sad I didn't catch her name but she asked if we had eaten there before and when we said we hadn't she brought us a menu came around the counter and pointed out favorites. I ordered the kick back chicken (pictured) with red pepper jelly, goat cheese and green onions.. boom most magical combo with crispy fried chicken and a dense biscuit. My boyfriend ordered the chicken set go with smoked pimento cheese and jalapenos also equally good but I'm just such a fan of red pepper jelly. Each chicken biscuit comes with a side and we split them, cheese grits and tater tots.. both amazing especially the grits definitely my next go to. Two biscuits that came with sides came out to 20 dollars and some change but we left stuffed, like almost miserable we were so full. So while it may seem like 10 dollars is a lot for just a chicken biscuit you're definitely not just getting your run of the mill chicken biscuit but a flavor explosion with the perfectly paired dressings on the perfectly fried and baked biscuits. Definitely getting your monies worth here. While we were eating a really friendly man came up to us and asked how everything was, I'm assuming it was the owner or manager but I always like when restaurants do that, plus I was excited to let him know how awesome everything was. Our overall experience was amazing so welcoming, genuine and amazing breakfast. So sad to go back to Richmond and only be able to dream about their chicken biscuits, but next time we are in Charlotte we are definitely stopping here again!",

Nestled off of South Blvd, Holler and Dash shares a parking lot with The Waterman, Harris Teeter, and some other shops that I'll never visit, but there's usually plenty of parking. You'll probably have a line that winds around the entryway, but don't expect to wait any longer than 15 minutes. The menu is.. well, it's biscuit heavy, but that's a good thing! Their signature is the Kickin' Chicken, which I gotta agree with everybody, it's great. Chicken is very well cooked, good biscuit too! The Lady got the Garden Goat which has fried goat cheese instead of a meat, and she loved that as well! There's plenty of coffee, short wait times, and great menu items. If you like biscuit sandwiches, or chicken and biscuits, and are looking for something non-Bojangles, I absolutely recommend Holler and Dash!",

The online ordering was super easy. Upon my arrival I quickly noted how awful the parking situation is, they share a lot with Harris Teeter in Southend. It's a new area that will continue to develop was I only imagine it will get worse. I finally found a spot and approached the restaurant to see a line out the door. I figured that there was a pick up line so I made my way through. I saw my order sitting on the counter so I stopped a waitress to ask if I needed to wait in line. She handed me my food and told me to have a good day. I felt bad for the poor suckers waiting in line, haha! I will eventually have to return and enjoy an eat in experience to compare.    When I got home I opened up the containers and our biscuits looked amazing!!! I got the pimento cheese chicken biscuit and man oh man the cheese was so creamy! It was perfection! My fiance had the biscuit with goat cheese and pepper jelly which he was very pleased with as well. I enjoyed tots and he got grits as the side item. We will def return again but it is a little pricey for biscuits.   I'll also note that they have some tough competition with RISE biscuits so close by. I'm from the Raleigh area and I adore RISE so I think H&D has big shoes to fill! I think I would have enjoyed my biscuit from here if it was a little softer, just a tad too crunchy for me!",

    "text": "So I'm scrolling through Instagram being all nosey and ish on a Sunday morning and came across a Yelp post about this spot. Hopped on over to the official Yelp place for this joint and saw all these 5-star reviews. Now normally I would just bookmark a new joint or a place I want to try and get to it when I get to it, but I was at my house literally salivating over the pics I saw from my fellow Yelpers. That ain't the norm for me. So I just knew I had to stop at this place on my way to work. Well... it's not exactly on my route to work, but it's close enough.   I figured this place would be jumpin on a Monday morning, being that's it's new, it's the morning, this place closes at 2 PM. NOPE! But that's great for MEEEE! I didn't have time to stand in line. Didn't matter anyway, cause they move pretty fast.   I slide up in this spot, was greeted with a smile, and was squinting at the menu above when the lady at the register gave me a menu to view. I was overwhelmed cause everything looked good (pics from Yelp I mean), and I didn't know what I wanted to try first. Decided to go with what I know. And what I know is cheeese. If they can't do pimento right (cause they advertised it), then I'm pressing on. I know this place is about biscuits, but all the elements have to come together.   Final verdict: They did it right! They did it ALL the way right!   To be honest I'm not a biscuit person, so I have nothing memorable to compare this to, but this biscuit was RIGHT! It was flaky, buttery with a hint of sweetness. I LOVED IT!  I loved the creaminess of the pimento cheese and the few jalapeno peppers for a bit of kick.   The chicken was crispy and cooked just right. I have to say that because of a popular place (that shall not be named) that I frequented often was giving me some undercooked chicken on several occasions. And that's a no-no.   For the price, it's a pretty huge biscuit. So it's extremely filling.   The potato salad was aight. Better than some but not the best. I wanted to try something different and this was different. The flavor was good, but I'm particular with what's in my potato salad. I ate it all so it wasn't bad at all, just not the best. Again, good, just not the best.    But BRAVO Holler and Dash! I'll be back to try another biscuit tho!",

    "text": "They have a few kinks to work out but overall, fun spot serving up tasty food! We were warmly greeted at the front door when we came in by a staff member handing out menus and when we mentioned it was our first visit, she was happy to explain how the menu worked. It was pretty straight forward -- biscuits are the star but they have other breakfast items like omelets, grit bowls, etc.   While ordering, there was some confusion about my coffee order. (Sugar free vanilla latte with almond milk. I suppose I'm asking for it with such a high maintenance order.) They weren't sure if they had a SF syrup, non-dairy option, etc. etc. Hubby and I asked for the lattes to go but they were brought out in ceramic mugs. They also only have 1 machine so it took a while to get the coffees in the first place. Once we figured everything out, our lattes cost us $12. Next time, I'll stick with water.   We split two biscuits, the Chicken Holler (medium) and Pork Rambler. I was most looking forward to the chicken biscuit but ended up totally falling in love with the pork one. It comes with blackberry butter and fried onion straws. Such a lovely balance of sweet and savory! I had the fruit as my side but should have gotten the grits. I had total order envy watching Ted enjoy his cup of cheesy goodness.   The friend that we were with asked for sliced avocado with her grit bowl and they charged her for it... But, after receiving guacamole instead, and working our way through a few VERY confused staff members, she was told they don't actually have sliced avocado. Makes me wonder where the guac comes from, but I digress.   Again, overall this is a solid spot with really good food! Now that I know to just avoid ordering coffee to save on both time and money annnnnnd once the staff live through a few more weeks of service and learn the product, I think it'll become a go-to spot for us. Welcome to Charlotte, Holler & Dash!",

Each bite of my biscuit had a unique flavor!!The chicken was seasoned really well and the goat cheese with jam topped it off just right.My grits were amazing!!!! The consistency was just what I like (not too loose and not too thick).   We went on a Sunday and the line was out the door.However,it moves quickly and your order comes out quick too.Due to their being a crowd,seating was not the best despite outdoor seating.I'm not sure if it was because this place is new or if it was a prime time,but just a heads up!",

    "text": "This isn't your grandma's Sunday morning breakfast.. it's better!  I tried Holler & Dash after reading about its opening in one of CharlotteFive's email blasts. Right as we walked in we were greeted by a friendly employee who offered us menus and walked us through popular favorites. I ordered two of MY favorites: gravy biscuit and tater tots. The gravy was better than I could have ever expected it to be.. so good I had it again the same week, but that time with the cheese grits; which were everything I expected cheese grits to be, but better because they were seasoned so perfectly. I also tried to take my mom this past Sunday but the line was out the door for more than 10 minutes and we were on a time crunch for the day.  [The Gravy]: Think Cracker Barrel, but seasoned better. ($4.5) [The Biscuit]: Dense but still fluffy inside (how?!) and nice butter milk flavor. [The Tots]: Just your average tot, but the dipping sauce takes it to another level. ($2.5) [The Grits]: Seasoned. Cheesy. Thick. Heavenly. Great portion for to-go. ($2.5)  The Agua Fresca!!! How could I forget?!?  So, So good. I thought I loved OJ with breakfast, but I was wrong; it's Agua Fresca I love! It's a not-too-sweet, not-too-watery strawberry drink with the perfect amount of slushed ice we all love so much. Wishing refills were endless on this one. ($2.5)  The aesthetic was great; lots of great art on the walls. Plenty of seating for those having a working breakfast. Front area can get a little congested with those waiting to order, enter & exit the restaurant all utilizing the same space.  Can't wait to go back!",

We were able to find a spot to sit at easily. We had several interactions with different employees and they were all super nice. Our food came out quickly and we dove in. I poured hot sauce and honey on my biscuit (it's the best way to eat chicken, in my opinion). It was tasty, crispy and warm. My husband really enjoyed his biscuit, as well. We ran into some friends who ended up sitting next to us and offering tastes of their beignets, which were good.   The negative to me was the size of the chicken on my biscuit, which ended up being similar to a chicken tender. It made the chicken to biscuit ratio off and many of the bites I took were just biscuit because of how small the chicken was.   Overall, I think this spot is a hit and we will be back!",

Becky, the manager, was so sweet, she was kind enough to let me sample their grits when their power was out on our second try to eat here, and give us a token for a free biscuit upon our return!   We came back today and tried two different chicken biscuits so we could share them. The chicken set go, and the kickback chicken biscuit with sides of cheesy grits that were like crack!

OMG the best biscuits I have tasted. The chicken was cooked to perfection the breading on the chicken was short of amazing. Very well seasoned chicken not oversalted the spices were great the goat cheese with the jelly just amazing flavors all-in-one sandwich. I wasn't a fan of the sweet potato salad but did have a lot of flavor.   Because I was so pleased with the 1st visit I had a second visit and tried the chicken holler went with something a little bit more basic with the side of the cheese grits.  Again another winner just amazing. The cheese on the chicken with the pickle and of course I got the hot sauce on it.  This place does a great job at marrying the flavors and putting biscuits and sandwiches together that just are in harmony.  I also decided to order the beignets on this trip.  They are not Cafe du Monde but I was very pleased.",

When you open a Biscuit House in \"The South\", we must critique  First, I have a question...H&D, how do you get your Biscuits so fluffy with the perfect amount of density on the inside and golden brown color on the outside without it disintegrating in my hand or getting grease all over my shirt???  Do tell your secret so I can slip the recipe to my grandma and politely tell her to up her game.  Aside from the Biscuits being awesome, so is the food.  I ordered the oats with brown sugar and strawberries.  Pretty sizable portion and made me feel healthy.  Then I dug into Hollerback sandwich, which had some awesome sauce, bacon, fried green tomato and guac.  It was so big that I ate this in two halves and enjoyed it for twice as long.  You get a side with a signature biscuit, so I went with the corn based on the recommendation from the cashier.  She was right.  The flavor was so on point, delicious and refreshing.  This place is pretty casual with a nice outdoor space.  It's a little confusing when they give you a number, and you need to find the small hole in the table to drop in the the number so it stands upright, but the manager came right over to where I was sitting and showed me what to do.  Overall, great fast casual place to grab a filling breakfast or lunch (they serve local Pure Intentions coffee).  Super addition to Southend.  I have no doubt this place will do great.  If anything, they might survive on my business alone.",

Salty, buttery, delicious. Honestly the biscuit outshined the chicken itself. The chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy, but I kind of found it lacking a little in the flavor department. I plan to go back and try some of the more specialized biscuits with different sauces and accompaniments, maybe those match the excellent quality of the biscuit itself. 100% recommend visiting this location.",

I hope they go back to the original recipe because I enjoyed them the first time that I had them. The biscuit, I ordered the exact same biscuit that I had the last time, crisp chicken, pimento cheese, sorghum, ect however the biscuit seemed over baked, they weren't moist like before and the color was a little beyond golden brown to the point where I think someone may have over baked them. The chicken was still moist and delicious but overall I found the food quality was not up to the same standard that it was on my first visit. I'm hoping things return to normal!",

From the menu being filled with words like \"pepper jam\", \"goat cheese\" and (of course) avocado to its clever, creative names like \"hollerback\" sauce and \"Everyday I'm brusslin'\", this is an effort to appeal to millenials.   The atmosphere was more of the same and was probably my favorite part of the experience.  For the food: everthing we had was ok, nothing was really impressive. I definitely appreciate what they were trying for but it seemed to fall a bit short. Several menu items seemed like they were trying to throw in buzzwords that the millenials would like to hear and things seemed to have a lot going on. The biscuits were on the dry side and $10.50 for a biscuit + a side left me pretty hungry.  All in all, I am very glad an older company is trying to pivot to appeal to the next generation and they definitely tried very hard but it seemed to me like they missed a few keys needed to bring it together",

I usually add an egg. the biscuits are massive so you don't need a side but the tots dipped in the gravy or hollerback sauce are so good.   but circling back to the beignets. fluffy and flaky and they melt on your mouth.

    "text": "Great: The biscuit texture was on point! Fried chicken was tasty! The pork and onion straw whatever biscuit was delicious. Grits were a hit. The guy working the register up front was pretty awesome. The online ordering and payment system was efficient and UI was good.   Not so great: I ordered 2 days ahead of time and set it for an 1:35 (or so) pick up. I was 2 minutes after pick-up time, at 1:37, and it wasn't ready. It wasn't ready for another 15 minutes. Here's a clue: if there's a large order set for pick up at a specific time, it needs to be ready at that time. Because then you don't just have one person waiting for their food, you have, in this case, 15. That's why we order ahead of time, to give you super notice that there's a larger order coming up.  Poor: I think they were training a new hire that day. He was the.Worst. He sort of sauntered and slithered around waiting for someone to tell him what to do. You know those types? The types who don't really take initiative? Like, you've got a big ass order. Maybe you want to grab some napkins or ready the take out containers or whatever. Or maybe take 3 steps out to the front to apologize for the delay but reassure me that my order is on the way. No, instead what this guy did was he very loosely put the lids on the take out plates - I watched from the front - and then shoved them into the bags. When he eventually handed me the bags, one bag fell to the floor, and the lids came popped off the take out plates in the other bag. It was a huge mess. Of the bag that fell to the floor, all of the insides of the biscuit sandwiches came out and it looked pretty gross. Blackberry jam smeared everywhere is not the most appealing. There was no apology, no offer to remake anything or repackage anything... They just handed me the bag. Oh, but I was asked if I needed any napkins to go with my giant order. What do you think? It's a catering order. Brains are for using, right?   In summary, food good, but damn, please hire better people. The guy in front was cool. The woman in charge in the back was cool, but it seemed like she was the only one really doing anything. My order placed 2-days ahead of time was like 20 minutes late. For like $10 a sandwich, they should really at least come in at \"adequate\". This was less than.   I'll come again because good food in Charlotte is hard to find, but I'll have to lower my service and efficiency expectations.",

Rude staff, not the freshest food. But I had heard such good things I wanted to try again, so yesterday we came in around noon for a late breakfast. The staff at the register was friendly and helpful during ordering. It was busy but we were able to grab a table and someone wiped it off for us quickly. I got the Chicken. Set. Go and my husband got biscuits and gravy. My sandwich was a generous portion and also came with a side of grits. I really enjoyed mine, the sweet sauce balanced the pimento and the chicken was hot and fresh. The grits were also really tasty and full of cheese. The biscuit was good, not my favorite ever, but good. It was just a little dry. My husband enjoyed the biscuits with gravy and they're a huge portion for $4. I had a nice experience at Holler & Dash and would definitely come back-they also have all kinds of coffee on tap and espresso beverages.",

Very casual...Order at the register and food brought to table. Biscuit sandwiches seem to be their jam, which is not really mine but found something on the menu that was good. I wouldn't say their food is excellent. It was ok, but again, biscuits aren't really my thing. However, my lunch date had a biscuit sandwich of some sort, which I tasted. It was just ok. Would I go here again? Maybe if friends wanted to go for a quick lunch. Not sure I would go on my own accord but again, it was decent. Didn't knock my socks off.",

This wasn't a huge surprise as it was a Sunday but what was surprising was that they had only 1 register taking orders. They are right next to Harris teeter so I figured I would run in and do some grocery shopping while my girlfriend/friends waited in line/ordered since we were planning to go after anyways. When I got back, which took roughly 20min, they still had not ordered. After another 5min we finally ordered and the food was ready not too long after. The biscuits were extremely dry/salty and all of our chicken was over cooked. The best part of the food was definitely the tater tots and the beignets, both of which were great. As we were eating whoever was in charge of clearing plates was slamming and throwing them into the bins, which was very loud every time they did this. Really seemed like they did not want to be there. To cap things off, the ceiling collapsed by the bathroom resulting in the materials that they had stored up there(looked like extra supplies) to come crash down and fly every where.",

We looked at the menu online beforehand and thank goodness we did - so we were somewhat prepared when we arrived.  ~11am, they were BUSY.  Like line to order, lucky to find a table before our food was ready type busy.  Luckily right after I finished ordering what seemed like one of everything, we found a table for two along the windows.    We each got a main dish and then several side items to share so I'll summarize all the good stuff we tried: Andouille Hustle (he added a fried egg to the top for $1), Hey Eddy Omelette, biscuit + jam, tots, and beignets.  I tried a bite of the hustle and the gravy had so much amazing flavor I even ripped bites off the side biscuit to dip into it (would definitely order this again, egg on top and all).  The Omelette was good if you love goat cheese like I do, I wish it had a few more tomatoes on it and I'm glad we got side items because I wouldn't have been full on just this.  The tots are nothing special, but still good.  Biscuit + blackberry jam, was my jam :) the biscuit is large and definitely share-able (I didn't lol), I'd gladly get any of their sandwiches on it or just get a few to go for snacks at home.  Lastly, the beignets we got as a sweet finish... they were just okay.  I probably wouldn't order them again, but they were worth the try once.  Needless to say, we left full, fat and happy.  We agreed we'd both go back in the near future when we get another weekend together for brunching.",

Since it's a scrambled egg, there's not much to soak it up with. The bacon wasn't close to crispy and seemed to be mostly fat.  Overall not terrible - I'd been wanting to try it out. I've only been once, but I assume the food is consistent overall.",

    "text": "If you haven't tried Holler & Dash yet, you need to go. It is my new breakfast or brunch spot whenever I'm in town. My sister and I made our way to South End on a late weekday morning, so the restaurant was not very busy (though I've heard it can get quite crowded during more popular times). The location is nice with a parking lot, making it convenient.   The restaurant was really cute and comfortable. You order when you walk in the door, then take a number, get your drink, and find a seat. Even though you order at the counter, someone came by our table more than once to check how everything was and then to clear our plates.    I tried the Kickback Chicken Biscuit based on a recommendation from the worker, and this signature biscuit had already caught my eye, so it felt like it was meant to be. It was a biscuit with fried chicken, goat cheese, and pepper jelly, and I chose a side of cheddar grits. I liked the biscuit and the chicken, but the pepper jelly was the best part. I was a tad worried about how all of the flavors would mesh, but it formed the perfect bite. This sandwich cost $9.50, but I was stuffed for hours after devouring the entire thing so it did not seem overpriced. My sister ordered the biscuits and gravy, and it was also good. I want to try the biscuit with fried goat cheese, kale, and tomato jam on my next visit, which will be soon.",

We walked in, ordered, sat down, meal was ready in 5 min.  I got the bacon egg and cheese and biscuits and gravy.  3 meals were $20.  Not bad at all for the quality you get.  Sunday around brunch is when the line wraps around the building.  From what I heard there will be a whole bunch of these popping up around Charlotte, so be on the lookout and give it a shot if you're looking for something new for breakfast.",

    "text": "When I heard about the concept of Holler & Dash I was extremely excited. Biscuits with chicken/pork/whatever are one of my favorite breakfast items and one of my favorite things period.  Parking is easy enough to come by since it's right next to a Harris Teeter. We went shortly after it opened so there was a pretty substantial line curling from the register up to and out the door. That's always a good sign and the line was moving pretty fast anyway!  There were too many things I wanted on the menu so it was a difficult decision. Luckily I had scouted the menu beforehand and decided to go with the Pork Rambler with tots. The pork ramber came with a fried pork tenderloin, blackberry butter, and onion straws.  Number one, the whole biscuit pork combination of flavor was delicious. Each component of the biscuit was tasty - INCLUDING the biscuit. I've had these types of sandwiches in the past where the meat and accoutrements are great, but the biscuit or bread is garbage. This was not the case. Biscuit was fantastic.  The tots were O.K. Needed a little bit of salt or a little kick of something. I was able to taste the grits and they were pretty good as well.   Don't sleep on: The pepper jelly. They serve it on the Kickback chicken sandwich but I bought a jar of it anyway because I knew it would be gold.  Because there are so many tempting things on the menu, I'll be back soon!",

I liked both the sandwich and the sweet potato salad but I've had better biscuits. I thought it was a little overpriced given the quantity of food that was received. Would I go back? I'm not sure.

The avocado toast was not good at all, the flavor was poor, and the toast was soggy. The banana peanut butter toast was good however, just not very toasted bread. You would think you'd get at least two pieces of toast as well, one seems a bit little. But it wasn't bad I guess!   Overall the look of the place inside out is very appealing. They have a good size menu which is nice. I would tell someone to try it, but maybe get something they are more known for.",

    "text": "Sooo I guess this is the latest and greatest, hip and trendy scene spot in CLT.  Here's what all the fuss is about...  I've been to Holler and Dash twice.  First time, I searched several minutes for a parking spot, parked, walked-up, saw the ridiculous line, turned-around and walked out.  Second time, a weekday morning, was much better as I was able to walk right in, and order without wait.    I ordered the Kickback Chicken sandwich - as I was told this is their signature sandwich.  After placing my order, was able to find a cramped seat near the bathroom and food came out shortly thereafter (less than 5 min).  The Kickback sandwich was good, I must admit.  That sweet pepper jelly its served with is awesome - wish they would've put about 32 more scoops of that stuff on the sandwich!  The chicken was super tender and succulent.  Biscuit was soft and buttery - a bit dry for my liking though.  The side of cheese-grits its served with, were simply spectacular!   My one complaint is that I tried to sub cheddar cheese (comes on the Chicken Holler Sandwich) instead of goat cheese.  You would've thought I asked for the nuclear launch codes or something!The cashier had to get a manager, delete the order, and finagle around for so long that I just said, 'Forget it', and took the goat cheese it comes with.  So good-luck with trying to modify your order in any way.   With that being said, I'm definitely looking forward to coming back and sampling a few other items on the menu - like the omelette.  I hate to add to the hype and pump-up this place more than it already is, but Holler and Dash DOES live up to the hype! So if you are one of those \"Seen-Heads\" that wants to see and be seen - get to Holler and Dash.",

    "text": "It's True, Charlotte is home to some real \"famous Chicken 'n Biscuits,\" but I think the award is currently contested. Damn Holler & Dash, I tell you what, there's some magic going on behind that counter. I guess I should elaborate!  Around here is where I'd typically insert the obvious hollaback one liner. I'll yield to the other reviews, you beat me to it! When you walk in, the warm, natural interior design makes you feel very welcome. Good use of several elements such as stone, timber, and an exposed ceiling give the whole dining area a spacious atmosphere. When I visited Saturday morning it was very clean and ready for a big rush.  Speaking of rush, if you want a calm visit then make sure you stop by as early as possible (they open at 7am every morning). The place fills up very fast. Fortunately they have a TON of staff on hand to handle to the heavy hours.  My first visit I tried one of the signature biscuits: Chicken Set Go! There was a bit of a sticker shock on the price at $9, however once you get it, you'll see that this is no ordinary biscuit. First of all, it's HUGE. I mean the top half of the biscuit is larger than the whole of what you'd get at most places. This particular creation had moist, seasoned fried chicken topped with pimento cheese, pickled jalapeno, sorghum, and served with a side.  It's a winner! Wow, that chicken tho. The chicken was moist, and had the right concoction of spices. Perfectly breaded and fried right on the money. Just the right amount of crunch for a best-case biscuit. Pimento cheese provided a delicious creaminess and the pickled jalapenos the right amount of sour astringency to redline all of my tastebuds. Who knew a biscuit could be this complex, yet all come together to make the breakfast of your dreams? What I thought was overpriced at first all the sudden had a ton of value in size, taste, and presentation.  The cheese grits were very good. A lot of \"Southern Breakfast\" places around here give you a bowl of grits that look almost watered down, for me the thicker the better and here they do it right. Very well seasoned too, which is not always a gimme when it comes to grits. The kitchen staff has really proven themselves with my breakfast.  The only problem for the rest of my day was that I was ready to take a nap about 20 minutes after eating this! Southern comfort meets upscale living, granny got nothing on this.",

The flavor was awesome.  Pork Rambler--really yummy, the blackberry butter truly makes the flavor profile what it is.   Garden Goat--perfect for vegetarians, the fried goat cheese paired with the tomato jam was amazing.  Avocado Smash Toast--first off, this was so beautifully presented. Really great if you're looking for a lighter option.  Holler Back Club--fried green tomato (yum!) and the holler back sauce make the  best combo.  We also had baby potato salad, roasted sweet potato and beignets which were served with a delicious coffee based sauce.  Everything was cooked perfectly, presented well and tasted great.

If you want something sweet its a sweet treat but its more of a flaky croissant with powered sugar an they serve  it  with a coffee flavored chocolate sauce sorta like Nutella.  They use a few local ingredients they get their honey an pickles from somewhere local NC. .  I cant wait to go back its a must stop for breakfast. There is a juice bar next door looks interesting Nektsr.",

    "text": "Move over Gwen Stefani because I'm \"Hollering Back girl!\"  Holler & Dash has already shown that they are quickly becoming a cult favorite. I've been to Maple Street in Jacksonville, FL and Biscuit Love in Nashville, TN but Holler & Dash Biscuit House puts a True hurtin on their biscuit game!  As other reviewers have mentioned this place gets busy but the line moves quickly and efficiently. They had a gentleman greeting folks at the door and explaining the menu to those who have not visited the establishment yet.   They have six Signature Biscuits which range in price from $8-$9.50 and they come with your choice of side. Their are eight sides to choose from. They also have Classic Biscuits, More Favorites, Sandwiches, Bowls, Sweet Treats and A la Carte sides. Beverages include coffee, tea, espresso, lattes, sodas, juice and milk.  I had several items in mind even though I was riding solo I just had to try a little bit of everything! Foodie much?? I ordered the Chicken Holler with cheesy grits, Beignets with coffee dipping sauce and coffee. I grabbed a table number which goes in the small hole in the middle of your table or booth (they also have patio seating so pup friendly!). Just as soon as I poured my coffee and chose a seat my food was out and dannnggggg did it look good!   The Chicken Holler is a perfectly fried chicken breast with your choice of medium, hot or make em holler sauce, cheddar cheese and pickles delicately places within biscuit heaven. It was glorious! The biscuit was buttered beautifully and the chicken was seasoned and sauced to perfection! The beignets were piping hot and fluffy with powdered sugar on top. The coffee dipping sauce had a delectable chocolate flavor with a hint of coffee, superb! The cheesy grits were remarkable. I. Can't. Even! The coffee was House Blend and it tasted delicious. I was absolutely thrilled with my selections! I annihilated the biscuit and put a serious beating on the cheesy grits and beignets but of what I had left I got a box and a to go cup for my coffee, topped it off and went on about my day.   It's worth noting that this place literally made my Friday. Even though I dined solo I felt welcomed and as though I was hanging out at a friends house. Various staff and managers came around to check on each table. It was a well oiled machine and such a great new addition to the Charlotte area. Can't wait until I'm in town again.  Holler!!!",

We must have went at a magic time because there was no wait and plenty of tables. He got the hollerback club and I got the pork rambler. Both were good. The biscuits were massive, it was like one whole biscuit on top and bottom (not complaining). The pork tenderloin was a bit tough, but the combo with the blackberry jam and onions was amazing. The tots were good, nothing to write home about though. I do wish they had simple syrup to easily sweeten the iced coffees. Everyone that worked there was really nice and the vibe was very relaxing for a fast causal place. They have ample charging space and the wall sockets have USB plugins.",

Nonetheless, the biscuit sandwich was pretty good. Like an \"upscale\" chick-fil-a and 2x the price. The tater tots were like the frozen grocery tater tots you get, just a lot less of them. The silverware is FILTHY though so BEWARE! With only 3 of us, 4 forks were dirty! It was like playing a game trying to find a clean fork. Disgusting. Overall I don't think it was worth the hype but the food could've been worst.",

My cashier had a very hard time with the fact that I didn't want dressing on it. I couldn't add avocado... why? The greens were shriveled and yellow. The pickled onion and sweet potato just tasted like cold salt, and the charred corn is actually a little corn medley drowning in mayo.

Around, 12:30 pm, I received my grit bowl in a small styrofoam container. I'm not sure why the employee placed hot grits in a styrofoam container because the grits leaked through the container. Typically, the grit bowl is packaged in a large plastic microwave safe plate with a cover; however,  today in came in the same packaging as a biscuit sandwich. I've received subpar service today. I couldn't enjoy my meal with half of the grits leaking out of the soggy container.  I did not receive an apology or explanation for waiting 30 minutes for a grit bowl.  I'm not sure if the supervisor took the day off but there was clearly no order in the kitchen today.",

There was a little bit of a line, but it moved quickly. Food came out fast and fresh. I ordered the gravy biscuit and it was awesome! Just the right amount of heat and a great amount of sausage in the gravy. One kid had the Strawberries and Dash which I thought was great and but he didn't care of the cream cheese. My other son had the beignets. He loved because of all the powdered sugar, but I was not a fan. Sadly, they were more like biting into a piece of styrofoam. My husband had the Kickback Chicken and it was pretty awesome. He was hoping to find something on the menu similar to the Sticky Maple at Maple Street so he was a little disappointed, but the Kickback was still great. We also got the tots and cheese grits for sides. They were pretty standard. We were disappointed in the coffee. Nothing spectacular, generic regular and decaf, however I did think it was nice they had almond milk and stevia. Would like to see a flavored option or some kind of a house made syrup added to the coffee bar. All other items really had special components ubiquity to the restaurant except this one. They do offer espresso drinks, but we didn't try. Overall, I would come back if in the area, but this would rank number 3 behind Maple Street and Biscuit Love.",

Maybe that was my first  mistake but being owned by Cracker Barrel who has, actually a HUGE gluten free menu with lots of options, I thought this place would have the same.  Nope.  They don't even serve egg whites. I ended up with some sort of brussel sprout salad.  J's biscuit was fine he said but wasn't a huge fan.  The quick casual service was fast and everyone was friendly, so I can't really ding them all the way down. Coffee was good, too! Just won't be running back for multiple reasons.",

Despite how busy it was, they did not hurry us along. We went on a rainy Saturday around 11am and the line was to the door, but moved quickly. We were also able to find a nice table for the three of us- fast turnover.    We tried a little bit of everything and it was all delicious.. even the coffee was really good. I'm already thinking about what I'll try next time!",

The parking is shared with many other businesses and a Harris Teeter so it can be tough to find a parking space - especially on a Saturday morning.  Overall a great brunch spot!",

Twice the biscuit pleasure. I got the bacon egg and cheese biscuit and cheddar and bacon were melted on the bottom half of my biscuit and topped with a freshly fried egg. So good.",

They have plenty of seating inside and a decent size patio with about 10 tables. Since my husband and I walked with our dog we got a patio seat. Upon being seated, one of the employees brought our dog a fresh water bowl. In addition the manager (I believe) came out with a custom Holler & Dash dog biscuit! From that moment on I knew this would be my new breakfast joint!   Our food was brought out to us in under 10 minutes. Nice and made to order. I also started with a coffee, which is brewed locally. Love that!   I decided to go with the kickback chicken biscuit with a side of tots. My biscuit was amazing! The chicken was lightly breaded and had a nice peppery kick to it. The biscuit was soft and the goat cheese paired with the sweet pepper jam was a great combo!!! I even dipped some of my tots in the jam that dropped off my biscuit and it was dynamite. Definitely getting an extra side of it next time! And for $9.5 I left happy and satisfied!! My husband got the hot chicken pimento cheese biscuit, which he really enjoyed - but it didn't compare to mine in my opinion.   Overall great experience at H&D and I can't wait to go back!!!",

They look like they might be good but they are still CRUNCHY. Those are the worst type of grits! Don't get them and thank me later.   I got three garden biscuit again just like last time. It was still really good but the biscuit size is smaller then last time we went. My hubby said the same thing about his kickback chicken biscuit. The biscuit size is smaller.   What is also smaller are the sides. They use to come in a bowl and now it's a small ass plastic cup thing. The sides are so underwhelming.  Idk if it's worth the $9 for a biscuit when the sides are small as hell and not anything good to pick up.   I guess I would go with the tater tots again but meh.   Another complaint I have are the employees in the kitchen constantly leaving the kitchen to get their personal drinks from where the patrons get their drinks from. So unprofessional. They also are loud.   Yeah don't think I'll be back. They need to make some changes.",

The biscuits are nicely done and the selection of biscuit-sandwiches is great. Super good combinations.   I went the opposite direction, since H&D is known for its biscuits, and opted for a sandwich. I was not disappointed. I got the Raise Up Roast Beef and honestly it might be the best roast beef sandwich I've ever had. I chose the potato salad as a side and it was amazing as well. It's not TOO southern-ish (i.e. loaded with more mayo than one's heart can handle).   Alcohol isn't served here, but that's okay. All that means is the customer turnover rate is pretty quick. With a fresh take on some classics, Holler and Dash is a great fast and casual spot for breakfast or lunch.",

Everything on their menu sounded so good and nothing like your typical breakfast joint.  I was having a hard time choosing between all the amazing items on the menu.  With the help of the person at the register (who may be my new best friend), I went with the Kickback Chicken biscuit.  It was so delicious.  The different flavors went so well together.  Fried chicken breast, goat cheese and pepper jelly on a biscuit, wow!  I am only in town a little longer, but will definitely stop in again before I leave.",

We got the Chicken Set Go and the Kickback Chicken. Both were absolutely amazing! I may have liked the Kickback Chicken slightly more, but it's hard to pick. For sides we got the charred corn salad and the cheddar grits. Both were good.   We went all out and got the Strawberry & Dash and The Jam for dessert. I didn't try The Jam, but my husband loved it. The Strawberry & Dash was great.   We got our food very fast and the service was very friendly.   I highly recommend coming here! I'll definitely be back!",

I guess they didn't hear me because it was loaded with cheddar cheese. After I told them I said \"no cheese\" the girl misheard me again and gave me goat cheese. I'm like why don't you just repeat my order back to me so we are both on the same page? Had to wait for another 5 mins for a cold chicken biscuit. They also left out my pickles. The biscuit was good but the side was served in these sample cups, enough to feed an ant.",

    "text": "Let me start this review off by saying I am the person going to a biscuit house and didn't order the biscuits. I wanted to because the fried chicken there looks and smells amazing. I'm on a strict diet and can't have fried food or carbs. So I was excited for the bowl options. I ordered the Every Day I'm Brussel'n and had to resist singing as I ordered. I added rotisserie chicken to mine.   The salad looked beautiful as did my coworkers plates. The salad was uncooked finely shredded brussel sprouts, apple and parmesan, I think. The dressing complimented the salad well and I could have used more of it. The chicken was very dry. I was expecting a tender juicy piece of chicken and, instead got some rock hard strips of chicken. So it's not something I want to order again.   Staff was very friendly and the restaurant itself was very clean. They also have a Coke Freestyle machine, which is a plus since it has many choices I can drink like sparkling water.  Overall, I didn't see what the hype was about.",

I arrived early morning before work, and I already knew what I wanted and thankfully it was not crowded.   The staff wasn't very friendly but I was in a hurry to get in and out before the crowd got there.  I ordered the beignets, and the grit bowl minus the eggs as they didn't offer egg whites.  It wasn't a very long wait before they were bringing my bag to me.  Everything looked great, the beignets had lots of powder and were pretty good but the coffee dipping sauce that comes with it was a no for me, it started off ok and kind of like chocolate but then the coffee taste and bite takes over.  The grit bowl was really good kind of creamy and good flavoring.  I'm not really big on biscuits so maybe I'll try them at some point.",

Great amount of chicken: biscuit : toppings. Ratio. I enjoyed the sweet n spicy jelly on the sandwich. Goat cheese just the right amount.  Goat cheese sandwich (?) too much goat cheese for one sandwich. Wouldn't order again.   2nd visit kickback chicken and beignets.  Same great sandwich... glad I can count on the consistency.  Beignets = disappointment to the name sake. Won't order again. Should be light and airy. They were dense, chewy, dry with powered sugar dropped on top.  Tator tots = normal sauce that comes with makes them great  Potato salad - different but not tasty enough for me.",

Even though everything else was fine (cool interior design, clean, fast service, friendly staff, and my dish looked and tasted great), what they made for my mom was just plain wrong. It's like, are they playing a prank on us? Holler and Dash should have cut out any dish on the menu equivalent to my mom's god awful meal and keep everything else as restaurant favorites.

A nice touch was the young girl standing by the door when you come in explaining how everything works and handing you a menu.  You order, get a number and sit.  My wife and I both ordered biscuit sandwiches, sides of fruit and grits for me.  Two lates and you are at $30.  The biscuits were about half the size of a place like biscuithead and pretty much the same price so prepare yourself for that.  The flavors come through though.  I had fried chicken with pickles and American cheese, wife had pork loin fried with grape jelly and onion straws.  A couple of great combos, loveddd them both, wish there was more of them!

    "text": "I was optimistic about H&D given its relationship to Cracker Barrel, albeit for a different target audience.  At Cracker Barrel, service is always friendly and fast, food is good at a fair price, environment is family-friendly, and even if there is a wait, there at least you have a chance to look around at an assortment of items or even sit in a rocking chair and play checkers.  I found the experience at H&D to be missing on all these points.    I arrived at H&D yesterday at 11:30am (a bit late for the breakfast crowd, but early for the lunch crowd, or so I thought).  I was surprised to see the line was 20+ people deep, but I thought surely it must process quickly.  I was wrong.  It took a full 25 minutes from the time I got in line to the time I got to order, all the while just staring at the people ahead with nothing to do except wait.  At least it would have been nice to kill a bit of time studying the menu if the overhead menu screens had been easy to read, but for some reason they picked the darkest colors with near-zero luminosity; that coupled with the glare of the sunlight made them almost illegible for the entire wait in line, especially when viewed at an angle of any kind.  The only activity to pass the time while waiting in line was scanning the restaurant, trying to find a single table to open up, as most of the time there were zero open tables anywhere.    So after ordering we were given a buzzer to notify when the order was ready.  I jokingly said, \"After the 25 minute wait in line, watch it be another 25 minutes to wait on the food.\"  Turns out I was, unfortunately, prophetic: from the time we found a table to the time the buzzer rang was 25 minutes and 56 seconds, to be precise.    To recap, from the time we entered the restaurant to the time we received any food was nearly an hour (I've been to Cracker Barrel at busy times and have been in and out in 1 hour or less...including the eating of the food).  After nearly an hour wait, I was expecting something great.  Unfortunately, that's not what I got.  The food was just ok.  I got a chicken biscuit since it seemed to be the signature item, and I frankly would have been just as satisfied (if not more so) with the same item from Chick-Fil-A.  The taste would have been just as good and at a lower cost and a wait time 90% faster.    Counting the time to eat, we were there 1.5 hours.  That includes a bit of time at the end waiting in line for a restroom because they don't have sufficient restroom facilities for the crowds (just 2 unisex rooms, for which everyone must wait in line).  Even the McDonald's next door has them beaten on restroom availability.  Life is too short to waste an hour waiting for a dining experience equal to or worse than fast food so I won't be back.  It just wasn't that good.",

Kickback chicken biscuit: good but not worth $9.50 Hollerback club biscuit: ripoff. It came with what looked like half a piece of one slice of bacon, broke in half. And two tiny thin slices of fried tomato. It was tiny toppings on a biscuit. Tots: frozen from grocery store good  Grits: good but in a tiny cup 3 juices: $7.50   Overall not worth it to me.

The line was out the door and we waited probably 15 minutes to place our order which isn't bad as it took less than 10 minutes to get our food. The concept is fast casual. You go to the counter and place your order and are given a number to put on the table. I ordered the biscuit with fried chicken and pimento cheese. My husband ordered the bacon egg and cheese biscuit. We both ordered the grits as our side. The grits did not disappoint. They were cheesy, had a hit of garlic and were thick. we both agreed that they were delicious!  They also offer tots as a side which seem to be pretty popular. We will definitely be back. I think next time I would like to order the beignets which come with a caramel coffee dipping sauce and are only five dollars! If you're craving sweet, they have a biscuit for you. They've got a strawberry shortcake type biscuit and also have one with Jam and Nutella. The coffee and drinks are self serve so you never have to wait for a refill. Great concept all around!!",

    "text": "Stellar brunch experience. Everything a Southend millennial could want in a biscuit house. If you're really going for it, order the Chicken Holler - fried chicken, cheddar, pickles and medium, hot or make em holler hot sauce. I ordered it \"hot\" and the sauce was so good I took home a bottle - or the Chicken. Set. Go - fried chicken, local pimento cheese, jalapeno, and sorghum. As far as sides go, the baby potato salad is the best, seasoned with dill and a lemon buttermilk pesto, next in line are the cheesy grits and honorable mention goes to the charred corn - super fresh and light great side for a sandwich or one of the bowls.  Hospitality is on point all the way through from greeters to the cashiers to the manager Becky, really a local shop feel.  They serve pure intentions coffee and a selection of house made juices - the Agua Fresca is SO GOOD - a strawberry pineapple and lime juice blend that's perfect for brunch.  Overall my favorite things about this place are the people that run it, Lots of organic options (they make it a point to say everything is non-GMO and their chicken is fed millet grain and water only and everything is trimmed off before they hand bread it and fry it) and the perfectly sized biscuit sandwiches - they're big but you can pick it up and eat it withoute a fork and knife and the biscuits are cut perfectly round so no crumbling happens when you eat it like a sandwich.  YUM. FUN. GREAT LOCATION. EASY PARKING. GO.",

Upon entering I was warmly greeted and shown a menu. At first I was only going to get something to go, but after having such a good first impression, I decided to eat in. I ordered a sausage egg and cheese biscuit, with a side of cheese grits. I was given a number attached to a small pole. Note: there is a tiny hole in the middle of the table where you place this number lol. I didn't know that at first. After a short wait my food arrived.  It was love at first sight and bite! You could tell this was made with love (it may not have been... but it sure tasted that way). Also, its not many times where I go to a restaurant and feel cool just by being there. I can't explain it, you'll see what I mean when you go. This place is definitely top notch and they go out of their way to make you feel welcome. I don't know how often I'll be in the area, but when I am, I'll be stopping by.",

I ordered the farm fresh bowl and a biscuit with rasberry jam while my beau ordered the chicken set go and sausage egg and cheese. Everything was so delicious, I'm having a hard time finding the right words. The main feature of this place is obviously the biscuits- they are so large, fluffy, and crispy on the outside, soft and flaky on the inside. It just makes you take a second to wonder how much butter is in one biscuit, but you get over that real quick. The second thing I want to highlight is how crispy and flavorful the chicken was. It is the perfect contrast to the soft and flaky biscuit and those two ingredients alone would probably make a bomb sandwich. Lastly, I was really pleased with the jam. The color was bright and almost seemed like it was homemade- I really wouldn't be surprised if it was! I would absolutely go back.",

It was a Monday morning around 11am, the restaurant was quite with only a couple of patrons seated and eating their meals. I did not review the menu prior to arriving, so it took me a couple of minutes to decide what I wanted to try. I finally settled on the Chicken Biscuit, Tot Bowl, & Beignets. I ordered with the cashier and was issued a number. A few minutes after taking my seat, my food arrived. At first glance, it didn't look very impressive except for the Beignets. Upon tasting it, thechicken was overly seasoned and very salty, the biscuit was dry, the bacon on the tots was crispy. Crispy bacon isn't normally an issue for me but this bacon was so hard I hurt my tooth and I'm lucky it didn't break! Luckily, I tried a beignet before hurting my tooth...the beignets were warm with a melt in your mouth kind of texture and that coffee dipping sauce was bomb! Although my meal was lack luster, I'd come back for the beignets and to try a latte.",

My friends took me here for lunch and it was such a lovely change of scenery (lots of light, cool seating and interesting design).... plus who doesn't love a good biscuit?  The setup is easy; order up front, get a number, and wait until your food magically appears.  I got a biscuit with bacon, fried green tomatoes, a fried egg and guacamole (...and my mouth is watering as I write this review a week later thinking about it).  It wasn't so big I needed to unbutton my pants after, but it was savory and filling.  I wasn't a huge fan of the roasted corn salad... I noticed that no one at my table finished that side... I would recommend skipping that one all together, maybe try the loaded tots instead.  Overall, A++.  I can't wait to go back!",

A great place for people who want to go to a good breakfast/brunch place but without spending a lot of money and still get quality food and not have to have a long wait. We were really enjoying our experience and already talking about coming back again, until I started eating one of the side biscuits we got and I saw a thick, short and curly hair INSIDE the biscuit. Suddenly, all I could taste and think about was hair in my mouth. I really want to give this place a great review, however just because of my \"discovery\" I have a hard time ignoring it and not mentioning it in my review. I hope that I can get over this traumatic experience with holler n dash with time because I really enjoyed the food here and I do want to go back, but just not so soon.",

Not knowing the area, we came to Holler and Dash after passing it a few times along the way.   All I can say is WOW. We will absolutely be back. The food was excellent and fresh (give me that Pork Rambler and tots any morning after a hard night out...) and the service was courteous and efficient. Thanks for a great intro to the Charlotte breakfast scene!",

They forgot my butter for my biscuit, but it wouldn't have mattered... it was STONE COLD!   Don't recommend... but truly wanted to.

Anytime i see watermelon radish on a menu, I'm in love.  Don't be fooled by the line, it moves fast and the brief wait is worth it!  On a nice day, enjoy the outdoor seating or be quick and grab a table inside.  My friend had a biscuit and she savored every bite.

It's just how different the vibe is at Holler & Dash.   Certainly not country by any stretch.  Not hipster either but certainly closer to that than country IMO.  I fully enjoyed the Kickback Chicken with the pepper jelly, and goat cheese and the sausage and egg is solid as well.  These are not the greatest biscuits ever but they are good as are the fillings.  Ordering is easy and the food comes out quickly.  If you go on the weekends at peak hours you may be better off getting biscuits to go as they get real busy and sometimes folks may choose to linger in their seats long after the biscuits and coffee have been downed.  To those folks... Yes, you paid for your food but give the rest of the world a break by looking around and thinking, \"Wow this place is packed, I bet someone else may enjoy sitting while they eat...\"",

Once I placed my order the food did come out relatively quickly, I would say within 5 minutes. The food was okay. The side of tater tots was excellent. I also ordered a biscuit with jam; the biscuit was dry.  What bothered me the most during my visit was whenever an employee came out to the dining area to clean tables and grab the dirty dishes they would make so much noise. Like they LOUDLY banged the dishes and slammed chairs when they pushed them under the table. It seemed intentional, like they were so unhappy being at work that they wanted everyone to know it by disrupting the dining area with banging of dishes and furniture. And this happened multiple times during the hour I was there. Also while I was dining, supplies that were being stored in the ceiling above the entrance to the restrooms fell and crashed from the ceiling to the floor. It was extremely lucky that no one was there or they would have definitely been injured. The whole dining area froze when they heard the crash. I hope Holler & Dash decides not to store anything up there anymore after that.",

I've been here a couple times and I loved it. They give you a casual and fast way to enjoy southern breakfast delights. Mostly known as a biscuit place, this restaurant also offers sandwiches, bowls, omelette and sweet treats. I've only tried a couple of their biscuits and they are so good that it's hard to try anything else!  My favorite is the chicken.set.go. I'm pretty sure it's the delicious pimento cheese that keeps me going back! Surprisingly my favorite thing to go with it is the grits with cheese. I'm not a huge grits fan but they make it absolutely perfect here and it complements the biscuits so well. It can get pretty busy here but the lines go down quick and last time I went by the time I fixed my coffee and sat down my food arrived. This is a must try for a differ t kind of breakfast experience.",

I wish there was a better word to describe how my mouth felt after first contact besides me wanting to walk back up to the counter and ordering another plate to go.

Yes, the biscuits are tasty, particularly, the Kickback Chicken, which has a lot going for it... I mean, come on, are you kidding me? Goat cheese and pepper jelly! I could eat an old shoe covered in that stuff!  Our side of tater tots was nothing special, just the kind of tater tots you'd find in your grocer's frozen food aisle. There are many other tasty looking alternatives though and the eggs looked great. Our cafe lattes were beautifully prepared and were delicious but were unfortunately served lukewarm (meh).  The other problems for us were simply in the details. To start with, after informing the manager that we were wrongly charged $9.50 each for our Kickback Chicken when the menu board directly above their heads clearly read $9, she offered little explanation and no concern or apology (but to be fair, she was very busy.) I had to wonder though how many other customers were overcharged that didn't notice.   Despite its 96 sanitary rating, we had to search thru four forks and three spoons before finding  clean ones without dried-on food and had to clean our own table before eating as did the couple beside us. Also, can I say, I love dreadlocks and beards (hey my own son has them) but not when they are left uncovered on someone preparing my food, and there were three such cooks in the bustling kitchen on this late Saturday morning. (I mean did I die and wake up in Asheville or something?)  Maybe I'm just too old and uptight... but I have one last gripe. I hate to pay $28 for breakfast for two and have to order at a counter then have to bus my own table, which is the case for everyone here.  In spite of all that, I'd still recommend giving it a try but not if you have to make a 25 minute drive from south Charlotte like us.  So there you go... go ahead, Boo, howl or hiss, but just please don't throw rotten fruit or veggies at me.",

I came here and I was warmly greeted by the staff.  I took WAY longer than usual to make my decision because the Garden Goat sounded so divine.  I ultimately ended up and ordering the KICKBACK CHICKEN biscuit with a side of cheese grits.  Thankfully they weren't terribly busy and the server had the patience of Job.  Everything was pretty much made to order and served up fresh.  I was on-the-go so I took my meal with me.    The meal was absolutely delicious.  The creaminess of the goat cheese, the crispy and well seasoned chicken breast, the sweetness and spiciness of the pepper jam and the green onions freshness married together in perfect harmony.  The biscuit was fluffy and perfectly done.  The grits had wonderful flavor but were just slightly under salted and under cooked but not inedible.    I absolutely loved this place, the speedy service, the atmosphere.  For the Southside of Charlotte there was ample parking but I could imagine that it would be at a premium on the weekends.    All-in-all a great experience.  Can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "I want to preface this by saying that it was stacked against them as I have clear favorite biscuit places all over North and South Carolina. However, with that said if you're making a biscuit in NC or SC then you need to bring it. They brought something good but it wasn't quite near the top for me.   First, the biscuit. Each biscuit fan has a specific type of biscuit they like, I'm sure. Mine is the fluffy, maybe messy type that feels like a big pillow of dough that has perfectly risen to meet your expectations. Flakyness is a must, but I don't want it to run so deep down into the biscuit that you're eating flake layer after flake layer without ever getting that pillowy fluff. With that said, this is a fine biscuit, but not a great one. It felt a little on the dry side to me--not a dry biscuit, but a drier biscuit than I'd like. That's especially obvious when paired with something that is crispy and fried, like fried chicken. I don't think there was nearly enough sauce or something refreshing to add moisture to the overall biscuit. I got the Kickback Chicken--which I thought would have plenty of that moisture because of the goat cheese and the jelly but it just didn't meat my expectations. The biscuit itself was also quite small. Granted, I don't eat a lot, but I've gotten top notch quality chicken biscuits for so much less (or the same price for more) that it irked me a little after the disappointing bite. My partner had the tot bowl, and that was fine as well, but as with all loaded tot dishes it's a hard balance between loading it and keeping the best thing about the tot, which is all-around crunch. Overall, it's not a bad experience, but after having to wake up early to drive my parents to the airport, I didn't find this a satisfying end to my morning.",

The signature biscuits are all unique. When you break down paying $8.50+ for a biscuit and side you really hope it's all worth while. I ordered the Pork Rambler! Fried pork tenderloin, blueberry butter and fried onion straws! THIS SAMMICH WAS EVERYTHING!   I only give it four stars because my order was forgotten and I had to track down someone to have the order made. They took care of my order but it seems to be some execution practices that need to be straightened out after an order is placed. My buddy sandwich was incorrect but he didn't mind it. Overall two thumbs up here and I would definitely come back.",

    "text": "Good Concept - Poorly Executed  A new concept from the folks at Cracker Barrel. Locally sourced, upscale comfort food in a modern environment.  Went for brunch Sunday a week ago after Church. Had tried to go twice before when they first opened but in both cases, line was around the building so go to plan B which is find another restaurant.  No line around the building but there was one when you walked in that extended well into the dining area before it made a 180 degree turn and brought you past the order desk and another 180 degree turn to place you order.  We went through this ordeal and finally placed our order and found one of the few remaining seats which was a high top next to the cattle call line.  The whole time I was there, I constantly had someone bumping into me and that was while I was trying to eat.  Concept is you order at the desk and they bring it to you. A number of locally sourced partners which of the ones I was familiar with from the Davidson Farmers Market are very good,  My wife order the Andouille Hustle which is Andouille Sausage with Gravy on an open face Biscuit. She liked which I am surprised because normally she does not like anything Cajun.  I had the Raise Up Roast Beef. Well prepared but way too salty and this is odd. I've been criticized before for salting my food first and normally a little salt is good. In this case, way to salty from the get go.  The Salad which the side was good although the spinach was not prime  Bottom line.  Food was OK but split results. Wife liked her's and I did not like mine.  Both agreed, way too noisy. Ambiance: design was good but being in a cattle chute the whole time you were trying to have as least a moderately quite is not good",

My husband ordered a plain fried chicken biscuit and agreed the breading was special.  When we first entered, my eyes immediately went to the screen which displayed menu items. Unfortunately the screen only displays their most popular options and they have a paper menu in the corner that contains their full menu. I didn't realize this and ordered something different and then it was too late to change my mind. I wanted the beignets! They should communicate this clearly because as a first time visitor why would I look for a paper menu if there's a huge screen with menu items on it right there? The screen didn't say anything about it only displaying certain items.  The lattes we ordered were delicious though and so were the biscuits. I would definitely return!",

The food was good, but why would I return to a place where I'm doing most of the work?",

The biscuits were flaky and had distinct layering, and the bowl we had was also quite tasty. I particularly loved the Nutella and jam biscuit - this isn't something you can find everywhere! The service was super friendly, and it was nice to be able to enjoy breakfast outside on the patio under a happy yellow umbrella. I would definitely return on a future trip!",

The cashier did not greet us upon arrival, and when I asked her for recommendations, she did not seem interested in helping.  A gentleman was getting a soda from the machine and when the machine stopped working, he looked at an employee and asked for help.  She looked at him, raised her arms, shook her head \"No\" and walked away offering no assistance.  Not one employee was pleasant the entire time we were there eating. I will not be coming back to your establishment. I hope this review will push upper management to review their low performing staff and replace them.",

The fried chicken is surprisingly moist contrary to how it looks, and it was topped with jalapeno, pimento, and sorghum. First time trying sorghum, and it's like maple syrup but less sweet with a stronger flavor. My entree also came with a side, so I chose the tots, which were fresh (crunchy outter and moist inner). We also ordered the New Orleans style beignets... Which were a fail in my book, so I took off a star for being misled. As a native New Orleanian, I really couldn't tell what made it New Orleans style. The taste is different. The texture is different. The shape is different. NOLA beignets don't come with dip either. All in all, I would still recommend this place. Just stay away from the \"beignets\" if you want them NOLA style.",

But when you find a place that takes everything thing in the freaking kitchen and throws it on a biscuit YOU HAVE TO GIVE THAT PLACE A SHOT.   Now a quick disclaimer, I am not a biscuit fan. They are always too dry and make me choke. They give me flashbacks to church potlucks dinner where some old lady brought ham biscuits that she froze from her wedding reception in 1925. However, my wife is a biscuit fan, and we have a hotel room with no kids for the weekend...so I chose the biscuit place. And I didn't regret it.   These are not funeral ham biscuits. Those freaking biscuits melted in my mouth. I got the chicken and bacon egg and cheese biscuit. Holy crap! Bread never tasted so good! I wish we lived closer. I would hit this place up every Saturday. The beignets were off the hook! And the coffee was amazing. The atmosphere was awesome, I wish we had eaten there, but bringing breakfast back to my wife in bed was a just a little bit better.   If you are looking for breakfast or just freaking good food...go here!",

Crispy flaky exterior with a fluffy buttery inside ever so delicately blanketed in powered sugar... oh and a side of a chocolately caramely sauce that you wish you had a bottle of to keep in your purse on your bad days.

The chicken was juicy, the pepper jam was just like I expected it to be... reminded me of something from my past, just not sure, and the goat cheese & chives just did it.

I did not look at any reviews before ordering (shocking!) so I chose some basic items. I went with the chicken biscuit and grits and breakfast date got the grits bowl and biscuit with jelly.  Chicken biscuit: It is a nice serving. Almost impossible to eat without taking off of the top of the biscuit. I added an egg to. The chicken was well-seasoned (which I don't find often from these hip, trendy places). My only complaint is that I requested jelly and there wasn't any. The sandwich kind of needs something to tie everything together. Once I found some jelly, it was a win-win! Truly enjoyed it.  Cheddar grits: I couldn't believe the taste. Plain and simple, get the grits. Co-signed by a southern girl.  Overall, a really good meal! I will order again.",

The biscuit was dry and hard but tasted pretty good. The chicken was also kinda dry and disappointing.    The idea of chicken, goat cheese and pepper jam is good and I have had a very similar biscuit at another biscuit restaurant, but it was executed much better.  The grits had a nice flavor but thick and pasty.  I do plan on giving them another try not so close to closing time.",

    "text": "This place was alright. I went to grab brunch here with a couple of friends on a Sunday. It was a little crowded but not impossible to grab a table if you're willing to hover a bit.  I tried the Kickback Chicken and the Chicken. Set. Go. with a side of tater tots and sweet potato salad (sharing with a friend). I'll start with the biscuit--the biscuit is pretty solid, however, it does err on the drier side.  The Kickback Chicken sounded good in concept, but, with the jam on top, it ended up being much too sweet for me and not savory enough. The Chicken. Set. Go. was also similarly sweet but not nearly as the Kickback Chicken. Despite the jam and syrup on top, both sandwiches tasted a bit dry overall, from the biscuit and the chicken itself. The sweet potato salad (I know should be sweet) was covered in honey, lacking any tartness to balance. The tater tots could've used some more salt but generally measured up to the pleasurable taste of all tater tots.  Overall, this place was a miss for me. I do enjoy the uniqueness of the restaurant. If I ever come back, I'll probably aim for a classic biscuit instead. If you have a sweeter tooth than I am or if you're a lover of jam, this place is probably worth the try.",

I also got the cheddar grits which were pretty good but not the best I've had.   For dessert, we shared a strawberry and dash, which is whipped cream cheese, strawberries, and cream cheese on a biscuit. It was pretty good but a lot for one person. I did notice they were giving a free half of one to all the moms which was nice.   A manager came and checked on us and was very nice. My only complaint is the long line at the front. They only had one open register and I think it would have helped to have both going considering how crowded they were for the holiday.   Overall, it was pretty good and since it's close to where my brother lives, I will probably be back.",

However, the fried chicken is was delicious with a great crispy texture and quality pepper and salt flavor. They also have this spicy name that was very fresh and yummy on top of the chicken. I also ordered some beignets, and was expecting something similar to those served in NOLA, however these were a bit greasy and more like a puff pastry vs. beignet in my opinion. The service is similar to a fast food restaurant, where you order at the front and go pick up your food once prepared.",

We didn't even bother to put much of a dent in it.  We also got a cold brew coffee. I liked it more then he did but then again he did finish it so I'd say that was a success at least.

I had one with fried green tomatoes, guacamole and holler back sauce. Just an aside...the holler back sauce should be sold by the gallon. I want to find things to dip in it... Ok, back to the sandwich. The guac was perfect with cilantro and onion and the tomatoes were perfectly breaded in a cornmeal batter. It was so big that I had to fork and knife it. The tater tots were perfectly crisp and lightly salted. Try them with their hot sauce for an extra kick.   I knocked them one star because they didn't have all the ingredients to fix the biscuit that I ordered. They did call and ask what I wanted as a substitute...but when there are only a few vegetarian biscuit options on the menu, I expect them all to be available.",

    "text": "Now that all the opening hype has calmed down a little, I think I can do my review (with multiple visits and carry-out situations under my belt).  I still don't really dare to try to come here on prime-time brunch hours, but I think the fact that H&D is still around is probably a good testament on the much needed breakfast options in Southend.  They share a parking lot with the fancy Harris Teeter, so sometimes parking can be a pain.  Now that the Waterman is open along with the other businesses in the shopping area, I'm not sure how parking will be - but the parking lot always seems pretty full when I've visited.  Parking aside, when you come in, you order at the counter and you are given a pager that will buzz once the food has been prepared.  The dining room is large with booths and tables... I really like the ceramic coffee mugs (if you get a chance to dine-in) because it's \"all you can drink coffee\" and they also have a coke dream machine here.  A mixture of high tops, regular tables, and booths make it easy to accommodate parties... I'm not sure large parties would do well here, but I think if you got here early enough, you could push tables together.  The signage on the tables themselves read (I'm paraphrasing) \"find an appropriate seat.... be a good neighbor\"  which is nice because all-too-often I've seen 1 person hogging a booth while a party of six is huddled around a small circular table meant for 2 in other places  I think early on, they had wooden spoons with numbers, so I'm glad they've moved into the pager system.  There isn't anything occupying the table that holds up the spoon either.  The biscuits are what they are:  biscuits.  They definitely lean to the light and dense kind so you will fill up pretty easily here - especially with their specialty biscuits.  I'm a fan of their cheesy grits too.",

I met up with a friend here for breakfast and a chat, we had a lovely time and while the restaurant was quite full when we got our booth, it slowly managed to empty out as it moved from breakfast time into lunch time.  H&D is first-come-first-serve as far as tables go. You'll start at the register when you place your order and get a buzzer. Then find a seat, either at the larger community sharing table or one of the smaller tables/booths if you can. Now that you have a seat, get coffee and wait for your buzzer to buzz.  I chose the \"Hey Eddy Omelettte\" which comes with goat cheese and asparagus and heirloom tomatoes. It was definitely delicious and a good part of a meal. You'll definitely want to get a biscuit to go with it if you're eating carbs. They look awesome.  Clear your own table and you're done. I hope you've enjoyed your meal!

Some people weren't able to find a seat immediately but I got lucky and was able to due someone leaving as I was sitting down.   I just got the regular chicken biscuit and a fruit cup on the side. Then just a regular fountain drink. My total ended up being about $10. My food came out in a dissent amount of time maybe about 10 mins. The biscuit was delicious. You could definitely tell the biscuit was homemade and the chicken had a nice crispy breading on it. I was hoping my fruit cup would have at least some grapes or strawberry or pineapple. However, it had the part of the fruit cups no one really cares for just cantaloupe and honeydew melon probably wouldn't get that as a side again.   Definitely one of the better biscuits I have had in my life. I would recommend them.",

Sure, some menu items were a little pricey, but that can be said for really any place, and honestly, the biscuit was freaking good.   I ordered a simple biscuit with raspberry jam and their beignets (initially, these are what drew me in). The person who took my order was friendly and the service itself was rather efficient. The food arrived quickly, and the portions were much larger than I expected them to be. I immediately dove into the warm, flaky biscuit, that was almost a tad underdone in the middle (perfection in my book) and slathered on some raspberry jam. The jam is from a spot in Asheville, and wow, was that the perfect compliment to the doughy, buttery biscuit. I then went for the beignets, which were doused in powered sugar (maybe bordering too much) and was excited to dunk them in the chocolate coffee sauce. I have to admit, I was disappointed in the sauce, with it having almost a burnt taste, but the raspberry jam....well that was perfection on the beignets as well! It was a good, carb heavy breakfast, but an overall tasty treat, and I can't wait to come back and try some other offerings.",

With all of the positive reviews and hype I think I was just expecting more. I will return to try lunch but will probably refrain from breakfast",

I highly recommend getting here early, or using their online system because the wait can get long after 10am-ish. The kickback chicken was amazing, with the hot sauce just right. The only thing I wouls maybe leave off next time are the pickles (I love pickles tho). The pickles are a little thick for that biscuit for me, but I'll gladly eat them on the side.

The biscuit in its entirety was good but it was wayyy too much bread I took the bottom part of the biscuit off because it was just like whoa. The grits were good but were served in a small cup maybe 2 sizes bigger than a shot glass...aka not big enough serving.   All in all the food was good, oh and the sweet tea was the bomb yet not worth the $12 at all!!! They need to build more Biscuitvilles in Charlotte(I was shocked to see there is only one!!) so Charlotians can get much better food at a fraction of the price. No offense but there is more to life than Bojangles breakfast biscuits.",

I went back after receiving Merideth E.'s reply to my initial review below and I got a generous portion of pickles for my biscuit and wasn't charged $1 extra.  Also I had the cheddar grits this time and they were excellent. I'll also add the personnel has been very friendly, helpful, and efficient.  This is definitely one of my new favorite breakfast spots.   Prior review: I had an egg and cheddar biscuit and asked for pickles to be added. The biscuit itself was fluffy and delicious. The egg and cheese were also very tasty and properly cooked. Instead of adding pickles to the biscuit, I was charged $1 for a side of pickles, which would have been fine if I was given a generous portion of pickles, but I only received 3 tiny pickle slices for my pickle up-charge, minus 2 stars for that.  The iced tea was also very good.",

    "text": "Oh.  Em.  Gee.  Why? Oh why... did I do this to myself?!?  I can't... I just... can't.  These biscuits are AMAZING... And there are a few vegan/veggie options that look good if it is a \"vegan day.\"  Since this was a new place... this most def isn't a \"vegan day.\"  I got the Garden Goat: Fried goat cheese, kale, lemon dijon vinaigrette, tomato jam.    Oh goodness, it was great.  A THICK biscuit that is oh so fluffy yet holds together the way you need a sandwich biscuit to do so.  The flavor? Buttery (yes, I know that's not vegan) and velvety and just full of some sort of awesome sauce that most restaurants would call a \"proprietary blend.\"  The thick piece of goat cheese was fried to perfection.  I honestly looked at it and thought that it was chicken... and thought \"whelp, its a chicken day...\" because I wasn't going to pass up the opportunity to try this place.  Nope... Cheese!  Creamy... delicious... cheese!  Maybe it is because I only smell cheese once a week that it just seemed awesome, but this was perfect.  The golden crisp crunchy outside was the perfect entryway to the smooth-textured inside of the \"patty.\"  The kale was a beautiful surprise with each bite.  Almost making me think that this was some sort of health-food that I was eating, but in a good way.  The staff were very helpful.  They just opened a few weeks ago and have someone at the door to greet you and guide you through the process.  IDK if that is something they just \"do\" or felt necessary because someone got confused and didn't know where to order.  The process is simple... walk up to the order area, place order, grab number, wait till number is called... Hard, I know.  BUT, it was amazing to see that these people take pride in helping their customers have a great experience.  Price?  What I would expect from any on-trend place with great food.  $9 for a great tasting/sized biscuit and a side.    Check.  It.  Out.",

When we tried to ask the employees how much longer it would take the employees ignored us at the counter and had attitudes. Only one lady was taking everyone's order after the other cashier just walked away with a line out the door. The one lady at the cashier was the only employee who acknowledged us and re-entered our order. There was no organization in this restaurant during rush hour, employees were rude, and the restaurant was running out of supplies. Overall I had a terrible experience. The food we finally got was typical southern food and ended up being too salty to eat. Will not be returning to this restaurant.",

And they have 15 minute parking for those doing take out, which is what I did.  I was greeted as soon as i walked thru the door.  The decor and friendly staff was great.  I ordered the chicken holler with medium sauce on the side, and a side of cheesy grits.  I also ordered the chicken set go with a side of fruit for my husband.  After placing my order, they gave me a huge table number to hold.  That's probably a little overkill for to go orders as i sit with this tall table number stand.  Once they called my number, i checked to make sure everything was correct... And to my surprise they forgot to put my sauce on the side.  I have the same issue when i go to Rise, which makes me believe that it's the type of register that they are using.   Or maybe it's just a human mistake.  I sure hope that this isn't the norm.  But considering that it was only 2 other customers in the place, I'm not sure how they could have missed it.  Now, for my review of the food... the chicken holler was good, but the chicken set go was outstanding.  I almost wanted to switch biscuits with my husband.  The cheesy grits was ok.  It wasn't better than the flying biscuit or big view diner grits.  Overall, i will certainly visit this place again and probably really soon, as in next week.  :)  staff... Please don't forget my sauce when i do come back.",

This was like one small step up from a chick fil a sandwich.   Also, the sides are super small.  I don't know...I just wasnt that impressed.  Not enough to come back.

My first visit I walked in and was greeted at the door by a friendly smile and a menu. The line was pretty long but could tell it was moving and plus I needed the time to decide what I was going to get since they have a lot more than just biscuits. I ordered the grit bowl to go and I'll just say it didn't make it out the parking lot it was so good.  Everything about it made a perfect combination. My second visit I was again greeted by a smile and there was no line, both visits were on a Saturday morning, but shortly after I ordered it got packed. I went for the Hollerback Club because I wanted to try a biscuit this time. But to my surprise when I ordered the cashier asked would I like it on potato bread or a bed of kale, since I just left the gym I went for the bed of kale. I love that they have healthier alternatives and it was so good. I cleaned my plate whereas I think I probably wouldn't have eaten much of the biscuit because my friend didn't really eat the biscuit just everything else. The fried green tomato and the Hollerback sauce were so good and they have really good grits.",

    "text": "This place was fantastic! We stopped here for family on a recent Charlotte trip and the place was buzzing. The patio was filled with patrons and even a few dogs so you know it's legit. The inside can get a bit loud, so just be mindful of that if you stop in with a crushing hangover. The food here was great! Laura and I started with an order of Beignet's for the table. They come with coffee dipping sauce that is to die for! This is for sure a must try. From there I got the chicken biscuit with a side of chimichurri mayo and holy cow this mayo is the bomb! It adds a perfect touch to the chicken and biscuit. Laura got the Avocado Smash Toast and it came out beautifully! Talk about food porn. Another of our family got the Raised Up Roast Beef which looked fantastic! I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick delicious meal.",

Becky has always made our experience with this place wonderful. She goes out of her to ask how we are doing and remembers everything we talk about. This means a lot in these days of scripted welcomes with fake smiles behind them.    The food here is always great but it's really the people here that bring us back. (Mmmm Garden Goat)  Again ,Thank You Becky for being who you are. Don't change and you will go far in this world.  Your loyal customers   Jon and Karen",

To bad the food I ordered did not reach the same rating level as the staff. I admit that food was tasty (if I had the option to rate it a 3.5, I would) but  definitely not 4. At $9.50 for my biscuit sandwich, I expected the \"goat cheese\" to be as generously applied to this item as was the \"sweet pepper jelly\" but sadly, it was not. Additionally, my biscuit did fall apart. The Charred Corn salad suffered a similar fate as the Kickback Chicken Biscuit sandwich whereas, it lacked sufficient \"Mozzarella\" (I identified 3 small cubes) as an ingredient. After the chicken, I would guess that the cheeses represented the next sufficient cost associate with these products, thus this may explain their small amounts.  Nevertheless, I will return to this establishment to try other menu items (which looked appealing) that I witnessed other patrons eating.",

They are officially My Favorite Biscuit, which is saying a lot. The melted on cheese was excellent, and one biscuit w/egg and cheese left me full for a day of physical activity.  10/10 I recommend stopping by to grab a biscuit.

Needless to say, there was still a decent line to order. There was an employee greeting everyone, passing out menus & providing answers to any questions. Their were two employees ringing purchases, so the line moved pretty quickly.  I got the Kickback Chicken with cheese grits as my side. I didn't wait long until the order was ready. SO delicious. The biscuit was HUGE! No worries, I was able to tackle it. The chicken was smothered in honey - which was great, so it took off the heat from the jalapenos. Pimento cheese was yummy, too. The grits were amazing - I'm just greedy & wish there was more in the cup.  Really love this spot & will definitely be back. Friendly employees, reasonable prices. Parking is my only gripe.",

It was a small amount. Shared that and the Brussels sprout bowl (basically a good sized bowl of chopped up raw Brussels and a few slices of apple and craisins ....  btw felt very healthy lolol) with hubby and it was a perfect amount of food. Glad they had that option so I could balance out the fried chicken in my health-conscious tummy :) the sides come in a tiny cup which I wouldn't have expected if I hadn't saw other people's food.  We got a side of fruit which was some melon and pineapple. Clean, cute, casual, and modern interior with plenty of seating. Plenty of parking in the lot. You go up to the counter to order and when your buzzer rings you get the food. Happy that we tried this place! It lists on Yelp as Breakfast and Brunch but the food is versatile and appropriate for lunch. If we are ever back in Charlotte would love to try the beignets!  Appreciated the very nice sized napkins and techy machine which dispensed water.   On food alone I wouldn't give 5 stars but overall they delivered!",

Let's break it down:  Biscuit: not too thick or doughy, crispy exterior but buttery and juuuuust right. Bojangles watch out.   Chicken: seasoned/sauced perfectly. The sauce wasn't running off the biscuit, it just adhered to the chicken the perfect amount to where I could taste it. Amazing. Great texture and flavor here.   Toppings: I had pickles adorning my biscuit with a slice of cheddar. Sounds average, right? Wrong. The pairing is what you'd called perfection. The spicy chicken paired with the fresh and sweet pickles was such a beautifully paired combination. The cheese was the perfect thickness, too. Married together, it was happily ever after in my mouth.   Side: I looked at the side, and I said to myself \"looks good enough, let's try it.\" It. Was. Delectable. The combination of flavors that I would have never expected were tantalizing my tastebuds! Apples, butternut squash, kale and whatever vinegar that it was mixed with had me wishing that it would never end!   All I know is that I'm looking at my schedule for the next time that I can get myself eating here again. If teleportation was a thing, you know I would already be eating Holler and Dash!   Side note: the name of this place is genius. I'm hollering that it's good, and I'm dashing back as soon as possible. Who knows the real meaning behind the name....but I know what it means to me!",

    "text": "What a great start to my boyfriend's staycation birthday weekend in Charlotte!  He wanted a restaurant that served biscuits and gravy and found this place. When you arrive, it kind of gives you Noodles and Company vibes. Their menu has everything from biscuit dishes and sandwiches to omelettes and coffee. And for those that prefer, they even have almond milk (for your creamer alternative)!  My boyfriend got his biscuits and gravy with a side of fried chicken tossed in their Holler Back hot sauce, with a Nitro Cold Brew for his drink. I got the Kickback Chicken biscuit dish, with a vanilla latte (w/ almond milk). I've included the photos of the food below.  We both really loved our food and the drinks as well. The chicken didn't have too much fried bits and didn't overpower the chicken. The biscuits were huge and fluffy and definitely filled us up fast. The Holler Back hot sauce was delicious, but nothing we haven't tasted before. My dish came with goat cheese, and I didn't hate it. The cheddar grits was my FAVORITE part of my food. They were super flavorful and they gave the right portion size. For both of our dishes they were the perfect portion size and we didn't feel like we overate or wasted any food.  The only reason I didn't give this place 5 starts is because it wasn't a particularly \"special\" or \"out of this world\" place, with the Holler Back hot sauce or the quality of the food. But it was still delicious!  For the breakfast lovers out there, I highly recommend this place!",

    "text": "So this place is definitely everything I've heard. I can certainly see why it has all these high ratings. I want to give it a 5 but unfortunately my signature biscuit today was a 4. It certainly wasn't bad at all. It just didn't meet my expectations based on the ingredients and what I saw on the menu.  Speaking of the menu, it's great! I love simple menus. Even more so, I love simple menus with a lot options and creative and eclectic food choices. Right off the bat when walked in I saw several similarities to Rise biscuits and bakery but I was immediately way more excited about their menu.  Their specialty is biscuits so the obviously have a lot of buscuit options. When it comes to biscuit options I would say they have three different types. 1. The simple type: A biscuit with jam, jelly, etc. 2. The breakfast type: A buscuit with eggs, cheese and your choice of meat and 3. The signature type: This is where it gets exciting and interesting. These options have better meat choices like fried chicken, pork tenderloin, fancier cheeses, etc. as well as some unique accompaniments.   I got the kickback chicken which has Fried chicken, goat cheese, green onion, and sweet pepper jelly. It was preety good but not as mind-blowing as it sounds on paper hence the aforementioned 4 rating. I am excited to go back and try the pork tenderloin biscuit however. It's called the pork Rambler and it has Fried pork tenderloin, blackberry butter, and fried onion. straws. They also have great sides and I got the charred corn, mozzarella and lime salad however the biscuit sandwiches are so huge that I didn't even need it.  All in all, a lot of great menu options so I'm excited to go back and try them again for brunch. Maybe next time they'll get a 5!",

The cashiers and ordering station are immediately at the entrance which creates a bit of a cluster when its as busy as this morning was...  Orders were a bit delayed and some were a bit confused for dine in orders, but thats to be expected with the volume of customers...Seating was a hot commodity!  lol  I ordered the Grit Bowl, Strawberry and Dash and Iced Cappuccino ... It took a while to get my coffee, other than that I was thrilled with my meal!... I will have to return when maybe its not as crowded, but this place is a great spot for breakfast/brunch!",

I ordered the avocado toast and a biscuit and jam and my boyfriend ordered the hollerback club. Everything was SO delicious and filling. Prices were very reasonable, too! And the staff were attentive and caring, making sure we had everything we needed. My boyfriend also got the cold brew on nitro which was like any coffee we have had before- so smooth and tasty. I ordered a hot coffee which is self serve which I loved because you can make it how you want and have free refills. They also have almond milk! Would definitely go back here again, hands down!",

    "text": "My husband and I finally were able to check out Holler and Dash this Sunday around 12ish. I definitely get the hype....the food is delish!  We walked in and it was slammed. There were no tables so we decided to put in an online order and go grocery shopping while it was being made.  I will say, the online order pickup process is super confusing and I really think there needs to be more clarification. We were not the only ones confused. There isnt any information inside about where pickups are actually pickup'ed. Since it was so busy, we stood around for a while trying to figure out what was going on. Finally, I just grabbed someone to ask. I think our order got a bit lost in the system but one of the waitresses figured it out and pushed the order through the line. This whole process was really my only negative of this place.  When we got home, the food was still hot and we dug in. We got the Kickback Chicken sandwich with corn and tots. The sandwich was big enough for me and my hubby to split and was sooooooo good. The goat cheese on it was so flavorful. The chicken was a nice size for the biscuit. The corn was really tasty and lots of flavors. I didn't really love the tots....seemed pretty average tots. I thought they were supposed to come with a sauce but they came with ketchup, so not as fun. The tots also were all stuck together and just crumbled. Probs won't order tots next time. I have my eyes on the grits anyways!   We absolutely will return!",

I selected two of the most popular signature biscuits:  Kickback Chicken - The chicken was crispy, the goat cheese gave it a tangy flavor, the green onion gave it a leafy texture,  and the sweet pepper jelly gave it the spicy sweetness that help type it all together.  Chicken. Set. Go. - Crispy chicken, cheesy pimento, spicy jalapeno, and the sorghum gave a slight sweetness.  The only down side is that there was too much biscuit.  I had to remove some of the layers to get the biscuit to fit in my mouth.  Overall, I would highly recommend going: The customer service was quick and pleasant.  The food was tasty and who does not love tater tot?",

I was given a pick up time and went in about 5min after quoted time...the place was busy there was a line...but there was no indication as to where to pick up online orders...when I asked one of the workers she responded rather curtly \"If its ready it'll be right there\" she explained as she just nodded to a small counter area. As I was waiting I noticed a severe lack of front of house management...there was one person working the register and one girl \"running\" food to the tables. The kitchen looked like it was staffed by a small army of cooks and people assembling the food.  After about a 10min wait...which wasn't too bad I got my food....I ordered the Chicken Hollar,medium with a side of the roasted corn salad...while the chicken was cooked very well and was juicy it was just your basic buffalo chicken sandwich on a  biscuit and I would avoid the corn salad...no flavor or seasoning whatsoever. I also ordered a basic sausage,egg and cheese biscuit..the egg was fried beyond recognition and the sausage seemed to be cooked even twice as long.  All in all I would not go out of my way to eat here again....and I think I'll just stick to Bo Jangles for my biscuit fix.",

I can see why the reviews are great.  1) The service and staff are amazing.  We were greeted at the door, offered menu suggestions, and the service was fast and friendly. 2) the food was delicious! I had a chicken biscuit and oat bowl. My husband had a chicken biscuit and grit bowl, and our 4 year old had a chicken biscuit.  We all truly enjoyed our meals. Everything was seasoned right, cooked to perfection, and left us feeling beyond satisfied.  We will be sure to visit again the next time we're in Charlotte.",

This is just a not as good knock-off of Biscuit Head in Asheville/Greenville- but owned by Cracker Barrel. Maybe I am biased, but I just would rather give my money to a family owned restaurant instead of Cracker Barrel. I think Cracker Barrel is doing just fine and doesn't need to make more money. I am sure the chefs are fine here, but I wish they had just made their own restaurant instead of doing it this route.",

    "text": "I had been dying to try this restaurant since it opened, and finally decided to check it out for Sunday morning brunch. It was extremely crowded, there were no tables, and the line took forever. But, okay, that's fine, I'm a patient person. I was ordering for three people- I got two biscuits- add fried eggs for $1 each, a fancy drink for me, and oatmeal plus a biscuit with jam for my husband. So we finally get to sit down and the waitress comes out and says they are out of oatmeal and asked my husband to pick something else. He gets grits and they came out first. We wait a bit and our biscuit sandwiches come out but no biscuit for him. The guy asks if we have everything and we let him know the biscuit is missing. He says he'll go get one but then he never came back. I start to eat and realize there's no egg on my sandwich. My mom says she didn't get her egg either. So we grab the waitress and tell her we still don't have my husband's biscuit and neither of us got eggs. I say it's no big deal, just bring the biscuit and can I just get my money back for the eggs. She goes \"it's only $2 dollars plus tax. Do you really care about getting $2 back?\"  Ummm, yes, I do. I say that I would like my $2 back, it may only be $2 but I paid for something I didn't get. She says \"I don't think $2 is a big deal but I can get it for you, it's fine.\" Hello, Rude. So she walks away and at this point I realize I'm thirsty- I never got my drink!\" So I just go inside and say I never got my drink. The cashier tells me I should have gotten it when I ordered. Okay, well I didn't, no one offered it to me or told me I needed to wait for it. So I FINALLY get my drink and I asked her for my money for the eggs, and I see the waitress coming out of the back with my husband's biscuit. She asked me to take it to him, lol. The service was terrible but the food was pretty good. I doubt I'll be back, though.",

The cashier said I couldn't because the fried goat cheese medallion is considered the protein on that signature biscuit. She then suggested the Hollerback Club without bacon (I'm vegetarian) but I noticed that signature biscuit didn't include a cheese so I asked if I could substitute the bacon for a slice of cheddar cheese. The cashier once again said no. When I told her never mind I'll just go somewhere else to eat, she said she could make the substitution this one time for me but they don't typically do it...but I had already had enough, it's disappointing how un-accommodating and difficult they were to me for simple requests. A slice of cheese would cost them less than bacon. Sigh.",

The wait staff also seemed to be loud and rude to customers this day.  Also ended up sitting by the bathroom, only seat open.  The employees rudely had to crawl into the attic in the doorway there to retrieve additional supplies and proceeded to throw items down.  Luckily we didn't get hit.
