We have to modify our pizza to make it vegan and that's where the dollar signs start adding up. They charge $1 to $1.50 per topping and we added 5 toppings. We almost doubled the price of the pizza in toppings! But I'm more than happy to pay extra at a place that offers Daiya vegan cheese.  Other reasons I love this place: it's in 7th Street Public Market, it's right off the light rail, it shares a space with my favorite coffee and vegan cupcake place. We can easily spend a couple hours here eating and people watching.",

They use extremely fresh ingredients and have a wide variety of toppings/speciality pies.  I always get the ancient grain crust, which is definately one of the better grain crusts I have had.  The honey they offer to dip the crust in is a must!!  The wait time for dinner can get a little long during peak hours, so don't come hungry, but it's worth grabbing a beer and waiting for!",

    "text": "I think they should rename this place Pure Heaven Pizza. I'm embarrassed at how long it took me to try this place especially since I know one of the owners. But with an office in SouthEnd and this being in an area with only paid parking around, it always got pushed down the list. Well parking should not be a deterrent- all the places in 7th Street Market validate parking- woo hoo!   So I met someone for lunch at the market and Pure Pizza has definitely built a good base of clientele because they had a sizable line. I got to the front and asked Juli her top recommendation which was the wild mushroom pizza. I think I'm going to be stuck like JJ because there is no reason to move on.  The wild mushroom pizza has some tasty shitake mushrooms (as opposed to shitakes that sometimes taste like dirt which I call shitty shitakes) as well as some other varieties, drizzled with truffle oil. I tried it on the sprouted crust which is lower in gluten, and I paid attention to the tip about also drizzling honey they offer all patrons. You yelpers are sharp, my friends.   I had an epiphany when I tried the savory meets sweetness all on a pizza. There weren't too many pizzas in Charlotte I get extremely excited about, but this pizza changed my life and my outlook. It's not a thick crust, but still somehow substantial. I don't know what kind of cheese they use, but it doesn't upset my stomach like a lot of cheeses, and that with the low-gluten crust made my tummy very happy and guilt-free.    I guess some people might want other choices (not me, my love- I will stay True to you,  Wild Mushroom) so there is a \"lasagna\" pizza and some other carnivorous options as well as sandwiches and salads for vegetarian/vegans.  I think I just might have this for dinner.",

Apparently, I need the motivation of an expiring coupon to help me eat some pizza that I know is going to be great.  As per usual, I am all over a wild mushroom pie like a dog in heat.  I chose the sprouted crust and let me tell you, it was the perfect combo with the earthy goodness of the shrooms. Others at the table had margherita and another pie that I can't recall at the moment. Both the other ones were on regular crust, which was also delicious, but I can't get over the sprouted crust.  I look forward to many a return visit.  Oh they also have local craft beer which is always a plus in my book.",

I've ordered the T-Rex and a basic pepperoni, the T-Rex is awesome.  If the line is long, it takes a while just to order.  For some reason, they are slow at taking orders.  It usually takes 10-15 minutes for them to bring your pizza out to you.  They have various sodas/beers available as well.  They carry some Dr.Brown's soda which is pretty good.  They have complimentary honey dipping sauces for your crust, which are really pretty tasty.  I went with the cinnamon flavor.",

I just know that it's hella (it's a Cali thing, sorry) good! We've been in Charlotte for almost a month and we've already been here three times. We usually get a medium custom pizza ($15.95) with cheese and jalapenos. The crust is thin and chewy-ooey goodness. They even give you a sample of honey to dip your remaining crust in. One sample had red peppers or cayenne in the honey which gave it a little zing to the sweetness.   The staff is friendly and the food comes out extremely quick considering that they make each one custom. I love the location as well. It's located at 7th Street Market, which is one of the Lynx stations, and it's also just a quick walk from Times Warner Cable Arena.    I remember the first time he ordered a pizza here. We took it to go since we already had dinner and he just wanted it for a snack for later. He had a slice right when we got back to the hotel and ended up falling asleep from food coma. He woke up to one slice left since, while he was sleeping, I had discovered how good it was. I couldn't stop myself from eating it all except for the last slice. Lala-oopsy! I think we're upgrading to a large next time ;)",

The Five Cheese pizza (fresh & smoked mozzarella, provolone, cheddar, & goat cheese) is an explosion of cheesy goodness in your mouth - awesome how all the flavors come together.  Ordering this and substituting pepperoni for goat cheese is a good combo too.  It's in a great spot, the entire 7th St Market experience is a fun one.  The only reason this is 4 stars instead of 5 is that a friend with a gluten allergy tried the T-Rex on gluten-free crust and was less than impressed... he said he's had better at Fuel.  However, they get props for the fact that their gluten-free dough is prepared completely separate to avoid any cross-contamination.",

As a JWU grad I'm a huge Reinhart fan, and was really looking forward to making it here shortly after opening... and somehow my first trip happened in November. Oh well. They were out of gluten free (which is usually just my preference) so we got the sprouted grain. Then we had to order a mushroom after we heard about the man who grows them in his basement, followed by a vegan and a margherita.   Needless to say, the way the bare bones vegan pizza was made said enough. If an almost nothing pizza could be that good, they clearly have the basics down, and everything else should be awesome - and it was.   The only thing not awesome? The $50 for three 12\" pizzas. I understand why, but at the same - seriously??? The honey samples she threw in kind of made up for it I guess. But next time I'll ask for a few more toppings, because when I added olives to my margherita, I ended up with the equivalent of about half of an olive minced and sprinkled on. kinda lame. I did have a nice surprise with the other topping I added, though - the arugula is in sprout form!  I will return, because it's darn good pizza, and if given the choice I'd definitely pay more so I could eat that delicious crust.",

Garlic knots were cooked perfectly with a crispy out and tender inner, did need the marinara that came with them.  They were understaffed but the guy there was polite. Salad ingredients were fresh and crisp.  Definitely my favorite place in the building.",

Not sure exactly what they do or how they do it but they really have something special in their pizza crust and focaccia bread. Maybe there are gluten fairies working in secret or something - not sure but all I know is it's darn good.   I have had their pizza multiple times and you can't go wrong there. Try the smoked salmon pizza for something a little different. Today I ventured down and had their caprese focaccia sandwich and it was nothing short of amazing. Just simple and delicious.   Not really sure what else I can say. Gave them four stars but probably like 4.5.",

It left a mountain of red pepper flakes on my pizza. I went over to the guy at the counter to explain what happened. As I handed him the shaker he just kind of took it and shrugged.  Whether it was them doing a poor job of screwing the cap on or someone playing a mean joke, it didn't matter. My pizza was ruined. On top of that the employee didn't offer to either remake it or refund me. Poor experience overall :(",

We stopped here (our 2nd visit) and got the Mediterranean pizza and farmers salad. My husband got a beer and I walked a few stalls down and bought a glass of wine.  I'm picky about my pizza and their crust is crispy & chewy just like I like it. For an older review that I saw that says it tastes like Dominos...what in the world are you talking about?!?  Not even close. The salad was fresh and fantastic as well. The goat cheese was the best I've ever had.   We made a great choice in that we were able to get great food and not run late to the opening of our show. I just bought a bunch Groupon for their Central Ave location and looking forward to going again.",

The two times I have been there, all guys have been working and they are not very excited about their product.  It is like they are doing me a favor to make a pizza.  I arrived there today at 7:01 pm and they refused to serve me because they were closed and were really quite rude about it.  I didn't argue, but I had driven 20 miles from work to get there so it was disappointing that they couldn't make a single pizza.  I have worked in restaurants; they were going to be there anyway, cleaning up for at least 30-45 minutes.  Obviously they are not interested in customers and I was a relatively new one.  Again, the pizza is great, but do not expect to be impressed with service (although conveniently it pops up to \"tip\" them on the Ipad when you swipe your card.)  Gotta love the audacity of that!",

The line at Pure pizza moved quickly and the food was delivered to our table in about 15 minutes. My friend and I went for the sprouted ancient grain crust, which was full of flavor and had a really good texture, crisp but not tough and with a delightful whole wheat feel to it. While not gluten free, this option is definitely \"gluten friendly\" all the standard toppings are available and we went with the pepperoni supreme that was packed full of flavor. the bill for a medium pizza with 2 bottles of water was $21. The only drawback is the parking situation. We parked in the deck and were only there for less than an hour and a half and it cost $8.00. Next time, I may try riding the light rail. No matter where I have to park though, I'll be back to try more of Pure Pizza's offerings soon.",

The only downside are the hours...since it is located in the market, it closes at 7:00pm Mon-Sat.  I live/work north of Charlotte so it is hard for me to get down to it during the week.  Hopefully they will be opening another location soon with more traditional hours so that it is easier for me to get my fix.",

    "text": "I have to admit i have been thinking about this pizza since i had it for the first time a few days ago. It was that good. Had the Slap Yo Mama Lasagna add Pepperoni, took it to-go, stuck it on the pizza stone at home for a few min and all i can say is damn that was one good pie. The crust was excellent. Thin and crispy with a nice flavor and not too doughy. Really good when dipped in the honey they toss in the box. The toppings and sauce actually tasted like lasagna and they use the large pepperoni. Its a win-win. I consider myself  a pizzaterian and i have to say this is one of the best pizzas i have had in awhile.  It really is amazing how much more flavor comes through when fresh ingredients are used. Price was a little steep so i wont be able to chow down here on the reg but i definitely look forward to anytime i can swing it. If you appreciate a nice, fresh and creative pie you should definitely check this place out.",

    "text": "Let me start with a couple of disclaimers - I was born and raised in Naples, Italy (the birthplace of Pizza), I travel extensively (and thus try food all over) so I know what I'm talking about, and last this is not a universal pizza review but it is relative to the category Pure Pizza belongs to (otherwise I would have to take in account price, etc. which it will make it too complicated). When I think of Pizza in the US I can identify three main categories: The traditional American-Style Pizza, Thicker crust, with thick tomatoes sauces, many cooked toppings, garlic and onion in almost every flavor with variations such as thinner crust and different cooking methods (gas, coal, wood fire and electrical), the Chicago-style deep dish pizza, with a thick layer of meat, very thick, rich in toppings, especially cheese, resembling a stuffed pizza and the Neapolitan Style, wood or coal fired pizza, thin crust, oily, typically fresh and sometimes uncooked ingredients (prosciutto, arugula, cherry tomatoes) or the traditional margherita with blended peeled tomatoes and mozzarella or water buffalo mozzarella. Although tastes varies depending sometimes what you are used to eat, where you grew up and so on what I can say about Pure Pizza is that it will satisfy all the categories as their pizza is a wonderful combination of American traditional crust (I'll get to the sprouted crust later) with a perfect mix of farm-fresh ingredients. I tried 4 different ones so far, and from the simplest one, to the topping rich one I was caught by surprise to each Pizza's addicting flavor. I live in an area where there are many pretentious little local Pizza places and Pure Pizza would blow them out of the water and I'm not kidding. Most of the places I've tried either the crust is too thin and cooked in colder oven and thus too crispy, or they have too much garlic and onion (covering all other flavors), or they either have too little toppings or they have too many toppings, or the oven is too hot and thus they are burned on top. Pure Pizza is the perfect combination instead, you will taste the fresh toppings, you will not taste canned food (at least in the 4 I've tried), the crust in not too thick, not too thin, the amount of toppings is just right, the oven is at a temperature that doesn't burn the toppings or makes it crispy on the bottom. Another distinguish factor is that you will get your Pizza in a record time, still sizzling, even if there is a really long line. No cold pizza, no going back to work late. A little suggestion: they do need to hand out numbers to customers that are visible on the table though so that when the pizzas are ready the servers won't have to scream numbers hoping people will remember theirs. Lastly sprouted crust: in my opinion anything but a white crust is a crime, however I was with other people at the table and one of the pizzas was with sprouted crust and they forced me to try it. Well, I was totally and utterly surprised, my main concern is that the sprouted flour tends to be tasteless, but this wasn't the case at all! I even dipped the crust in their fantastic local \"spicy\" honey! Well done Pure Pizza, I'm looking forward to try all of your other pizza on the menu (I think the pulled pork is next, a little flavor from the south).",

The whole experience gets 3 stars, but I will be back to try a pizza, and I will update my review at that time.",

To sum up the pizza - the tomato sauce was like water, no taste and sauce soaked through to the crust. Sauce made crust so moist, it was almost impossible to pick up. The topping included country ham, but it was almost non-existent on the pizza. Pure Country pizza? More like a pure mess.",

I can't think of a different way to describe this experience...   They offer a sprouted grain crust as well as a traditional white... The boyfriend and I (or me, however that goes) decided to split the difference... I got the Chorizo pie on sprouted grain and he got the T-Rex on the regular...   The chorizo had an excellent balance of flavor...  The sausage and tomatoes were markedly fresh, the radishes were crisp, the onions were nice and crunchy... My favorite part, though?  The cilantro sprinkled on top and the slice of lime they gave you to drizzle over the top... Omigosh, I literally ate the whole pie... I don't normally finish a meal and I made myself finish that entire pie at one sitting because it was too good to stop... lol  The T-Rex was crazy good... Bacon, ground beef, sausage and pepperoni with a tremendous mozzarella and a perfect accompaniment of organic tomato sauce...   The toppings didn't overwhelm the actual crust, so they both got to shine... The crust stayed crispy (which is very important to me) even though they did not shy away from the sauces or the other ingredients... I made sure to ask for some of that honey to dip the crust in and I was sooooo glad I remembered... It was absolutely heavenly...   I just saw that Foodie Call delivers Pure Pizza now... Why in the world did they tell me that?  I might not be cooking tonight after all... lol",

I can't eat cow cheese so they left off the Parmesan of my garlic knots and subbed goat cheese on my pizza. Everything was amazing. Bonus the knots were free because I checked into yelp. They even gave me a few more knots because I was nice about them opening a few minutes late. The pizza crust and knots were light and crisp. I also had a salad which was a little pricey but a fresh accompaniment to the pizza. I had a meat pizza called the T Rex which was very delicious. All of the meats complimented the airy crust without overwhelming it. The public market has many choises for lunch but I am very glad I picked Pure Pizza.",

So, you can imagine I wasn't thinking how delicious this might be or having the excitement of a fresh pie coming my way!    We tried The Chorizo, it was so unique.  It was like a street taco, thin crust topped with cheese, chorizo, cilantro, tomato, raw red onion and a little radish.. it was an explosion of flavor.  Just the perfect mix of hot food, with crisp toppings and tiny amount of spice. Well balanced, you just wanting to keep eating it, to keep getting the wave of flavors.  Local sourced ingredients, friendly service + delicious product. And did I mention beer? They have a five or six local beers on tap.  Good times.  Check times in the evening because it closes when the Market closes.",

I paid $2 extra after pick up but it was worth it. I also asked for some spicy honey dipping sauce in addition to the 2 regular honey sauces that came in the box. The cashier also told me they have bourbon, spicy, regular and cinnamon honey dipping sauces as well.   The pizza itself was thin with a large, thick crust. The pesto was a bit oily and there were a lot of tomatoes on it. The slap yo mama lasagna was yummy but really needed some other veggies like spinach. I think my favorite part about Pure Pizza was that you could really taste the freshness of the ingredients. Yes, they are a bit expensive but its worth it.   I wish I had time to grab the garlic knots, they looked good. 5 are free with check in! The sandwiches also looked good. I'll give them another try when exploring the market place. Cheers!",

    "text": "Updated after trying more pizzas (had to go back only a week later, it was too good!)  Initial Review:  Pure Pizza is definitely the best pizza I've had in Charlotte thus far. I ordered the pesto pizza with tomatoes and red onion with a few friends, and it was superb! The crust is thin but stays crispy enough to hold up the toppings, the sauce to cheese ratio is solid, and all of the ingredients added great flavor without overpowering the pizza as a whole. You can really tell with their farm to table approach that they have high quality ingredients based on the taste alone. While this does cause the prices to be a bit higher than pizza chains, the quality more than makes up for it. My only complain is that I wish they had smaller options than 12\" so that I could get a personal pizza during my lunch hour at work- but hey maybe I'll just have to feel like pigging out or want some leftovers that day.  New: The Slap Yo Mama Lasagna is also incredible. The ricotta, ground beef, and Italian herb combo makes this taste spot on like lasagna filling..it's incredible. The wild mushroom pizza is nice and cheesy with a strong roasted mushroom taste. Also go a free order of garlic knots which didn't have a ton of garlic flavor but were buttery and had a good bit of parmesan on top. With the marinara sauce, they were very solid. All three pizzas I've tried have been out of this world. The crust is thin but still crispy, and the pizzas come out very fast (less than 10 minutes both visits). The only downside is the slightly higher price than other pizza places but the quality justifies it if you're looking for really good pizza.",

I took the Light Rail up because the train doors open up to the doors of the market. I walked around the market for a bit before deciding on Pure Pizza.  You order at the register and get a number to put on your table. There really weren't too many available seats inside, but luckily there were plenty of empty tables outside along 7th street.   I got the chicken sandwich and my mom got the caprese sandwich. Both were absolutely delicious. The chicken sandwich came with chicken, arugula, tomato, balsamic onions, and goat cheese. The caprese sandwich has tomato, mozzarella, palermo sauce, and balsamic vinegar. They were both very filling. The bread was maybe a bit too thick for me personally - my mom ate the second half of her sandwich open-faced to cut down on how much bread she was eating.   I would love to return to try more of the sandwiches and actually try the pizza this time!",

Pure Pizza popped up on my radar and I knew I would have to try them out. Especially since they were in one of my favorite places: the 7th Street Public Market.   I went for the Pesto Pizza. Typically when I'm trying a new pizza joint I go for the trusty margherita pizza to get a nice base line of what a shop can do, but I switched it up this time and was very glad I did. I paid for my pie, got my number and found a seat in the dining area. Not too long a wait before it was time for me to dig in.  The pizza crust was crisp, but not charred. While I don't mind charred, but I know some pizza patrons do. Plenty of cheese & pesto drizzle to go around on each slice. If I ever make it back here with colleagues, I will definitely recommend getting several small pizzas so we can try a variety of flavors. I almost went back every day while I was in Charlotte, but I had to be fair and explore other options.",

    "text": "I come to 7th Street Public Market at least 2-3 times per month and always think, \"I need to try Pure Pizza\".  Mission finally accomplished last weekend!  To me, one of my first tests of a pizza place is just, how well do they pull off a simple cheese pizza?  Pure Pizza pulls it off very, very well.    This version of the cheeser had perhaps the thinnest crust I've ever had on a pizza with just the perfect amount of crisp and chew.  Still on the crust side, you get a little plastic container of some excellent local honey to dip your remnants in.  The cheese was perfectly brown and melty and stretchy and delicious with a delicious tang you only get from real quality mozzarella and the sauce was fresh and added just the right amount of acid to the pie.   All in all, this was a great pizza and I can't wait to try another variety on another visit to the market.",

I love going to Seventh Street market, sitting Not Just Coffee and having a drink while waiting for delicious fresh made pizza from Pure.  I've taken this to go as well as eaten inside the market, and I can say that the pizza doesn't do well reheated. So try to eat it fresh while there if possible.  If one of their specialty pizzas sounds good to you, go for it, as those are definitely a better deal for the amount of toppings you get for the money.  I wanted what I wanted, though, so I ended up with a medium, thin crust, regular crust pizza with jalapenos, pepperoncini, onions and feta.  It was pretty expensive at $2/topping = $20 med pizza. But it was delicious.  The arugula salad with goat cheese and lemon vinaigrette is to-die-for. I crave that dressing days later. So light and fresh but flavorful.",

I got all of the yelp deals available before ordering: 10 for 20$ and checking in for free garlic knots.  Even with my 20$ credit, I paid an extra 10$ for 2 pizzas and 2 waters.  So far, 30$ for 2 people worth of food is a little steep. But then the food came out and our pizzas were bigger than expected. We barely finished half of all of the food we ordered and took the rest of it home, absolutely stuffed.   The pizzas were pretty good. Slap-yo-mama lasagna pizza didn't quite live up to its awesome name (not to say it was bad, just not exceptional) but the BBQ was freaking amazing. I wish I didn't have two pieces in my sitting so I could have taken more of it home. Btw that pizza is just as good cold as it is hot.   And lastly, the garlic knots were free. Do I even need to say more?   Warning: lunch time gets busy and it gets hard to find a seat! Be prepared to wait around with your food for someone to graciously stand up and free up a table.",

I ordered for delivery through foodie call and had a custom pizza made of goat cheese, proscuitto, and arugula - my go to. The pizza came within the expected time frame (45 minutes) and I was excited to give it a try.  The first red flag (you can see by the picture) is all the toppings were plopped in the center. Who likes eating their pizza with no toppings on the outside and then mounds of it on the other side? I spent the next 5 minutes redistributing the toppings so it was evenly dispersed throughout the pie. Second, where was the proscuitto?! There were tiny cut up bits of what tasted like ham sprinkled on top, but definitely not the thin slices of salty, savory proscuitto deliciousness I was expecting.  The ancient grain crust, however, was very good and I also enjoyed the brown sugar cinnamon dipping sauce that came with it. I'm willing to give Pure Pizza another try...but I'll surely be there in person to voice my criticisms.",

    "text": "I've been to 7th street market for lunch several times and after hearing such great things about Pure Pizza, I was excited to give it a try. Unfortunately my bad experience started right at the register. I went on a Friday a few weeks ago at 12:30pm. As expected, the market was a zoo. To complicate things further, I had my 4 month old with me in a stroller. I was surprised to see that there were only 2 people in line in front of me to order. The friends I came with went to Local Loaf and their line was much longer than mine. When it was my turn to order, I walked up to the register and pushed my stroller in a way that it wasn't blocking the main aisle. Apparently the cashier (who appeared to be miserable to be at work that day) was not pleased and firmly said \"You're going to need to push that stroller down there\" as he pointed down the aisle past their drink fridge. My stroller was positioned in a way that partially blocked the path from their kitchen to deliver orders to customers. Even though it took me a total of 2 minutes at most to order and pay and no food ever came out during that time, I did as he requested. I was entirely uncomfortable leaving my baby unattended in the stroller down the hallway in a busy market, but he wouldn't serve me until I moved it.  I ordered their 10\" pork pizza and got a bottle of sprite. I was shocked when my bill was close to $15. Nonetheless I paid quickly and went to get my baby from down the hall. The second big mistake was that I was given a #1 table marker. I had no idea where I stood in line waiting for my food at that point. However I was never told or given any indication that the wait would be very long. I went and got a table and sat with my friends. After 20 minutes went by, I still had no food. I thought I would go check back with the cashier in case my number wasn't visible enough. My friends were already eating their food from Local Loaf at this point. The cashier REFUSED to make eye contact with me. I waited by the side of his register until he was through with taking someone's order and then he proceeded to move forward with the next customers. Finally one of the cooks noticed me standing there and told me they were still working on my order. So I went back to my seat.  After another 15 minutes and my friends finishing their lunch by this point (35 minutes total) I went back to the cashier a second time. This time he noticed me right away and with attitude said \"You're order is about to go into the oven\". So I sat down for another 10 minutes before my food finally came out. So I waited a total of 45 minutes for my food. By this point I had a very displeased 4 month old and I felt incredibly rushed since my friends had finished their lunch 10 minutes earlier. I thought for sure the pizza may make it all worth it, but yet again that was mistake #3.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but the pork pizza was not good at all. The pork on top was dry and charred black. They put a heaping scoop of purple slaw right on top in the middle of the pizza. It made the pizza cold and soggy. The \"special sauce\" tasted like a buffalo wing sauce which didn't go at all with the pork flavor or slaw.   Needless to say, I had a horrible experience overall and won't be returning. Too expensive, terrible customer service, and not good pizza for what you pay. Save yourself the time and money and eat at Local Loaf or Hazelnut Creperie.",

    "text": "I had lunch here with my mom over the long weekend. We decided to make our own small pizza and then share a Greek salad. The salad was fantastic! The feta was high quality and the greens were clearly fresh. The dressing was tasty. The arugula was a different spin to my typical idea of a Greek salad but I liked it. The pizza was good! The crust was tasty and perfect texture wise. The toppings were clearly fresh. My only complaint was the pizza either needed to be cooked more or have less cheese on it or something. The middle part of the pizza was soggy and soupy (still tasty nonetheless).",

The pesto pizza was very good. And my kids loved the garlic knots - they even fought over who will get the last one.  This is not like a typical restaurant. It is inside the 7th Street Market, so we park up in the parking garage - we can get the ticket validated once inside(machine next to the Sushi place - free parking for the first 90 min). Take the elevator down, and we enter into the indoor market with Local Loaf, Cloud 9 Confections, Pure Pizza to the right and a Sushi place to the left.   And there are tables food court style - the Saturday morning we went, it was way too crowded and noisy!!! Again, not impressed!!!  The guy who was bringing the orders out was very nice and friendly despite the rush and lines.",

The crust is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside without being too thick or too thin. Be sure to ask for honey to dip your crusts in; my husband and I prefer the spicy honey and the bourbon honey but our 8-year-old loves the cinnamon honey. Get the smoked mozzarella instead of regular mozzarella if you want to take your pizza from great to amazing.  Their staff is friendly and efficient, although they're more reliable in person than over the phone. I have called in a couple of takeout orders that weren't 100% accurate (one topping different than what was ordered).",

The former on the classic crust and the latter on the sprouted grain crust.  Two bottles of cane-sugar Cheerwine on the side finished out our order.  We found a table and waited not even ten minutes and our first pie was out of the oven and on our table.  The margarita was really terrific.  A nice crust with a little char on top.  The chorizo was just as good.  It was not overly spicy and the sprouted grain crust gave off a mild nutty flavor that I found complimentary.  Maybe not so much for the margarita or the pesto, but it worked on this pie.  We did not get the honey that some other yelpers indicated they received, but we'll be sure to get some next time around.  Service was great.  Julie was very pleasant and happy to help.  The kitchen staff was on top of things and they physically would walk the pies out to each table.  I will definitely be back!",

Their garlic knots might be my favorite garlic knots, and I'm saying that having tried a ton of garlic knots!  The pizza was really good as well.  I've gone back a bunch to order the garlic knots, the large size will fill you up.  It is a little pricey though, which is my reasoning for giving it four stars, but other than that, it's amazing!  If you haven't tried out Pure Pizza yet, you should definitely make your way there very soon!  Don't forget to check in and get free garlic knots!",

Apparently so did everyone else had off that day as well so I waited in line for like forever.  Finally got up to the line. I had checked their menu online first and the Wild Mushroom pizza spoke to me.  The online menu says it comes with oyster mushrooms, cheese, truffle oil and organic tomato sauce.  The pizza came out in about 20 minutes. It looked amazing and while it also tasted wonderful. The dough was fantastic. The best dough I've ever tasted on a pizza. The mushrooms and cheese were great as well. And the sauce?  Hey, where's the sauce?  No sauce on this pizza.  Dang. Was really looking forward to that part too.  So I was a bit disappointed that there was no sauce but overall it was a good pizza. Have to come back and see if this was a mistake or the online menu is incorrect.  I even checked it again when I got home.",

It looked like you could build a pizza too with vegan ingredients but I just tried the sandwich since it was already marked vegan!   I loved the location- it is in a place called 7th street market so you can gets lots of other things while you are there , like sushi, coffee, and a little market to buy sundry items such as jams, salts, veggies, chocolates etc.   Great little vegan spot and I woudk like to come back to also check out the rest of the area - the taps across the way we're a real treat!

The 7th street market location is their original spot and used to be very good.  The service has diminished considerably the last few times we have been here.  This is the prime example of ownership losing their grip on the managers of a restaurant.  My wife and I visited with a friend on a recent weekday evening, the market was busy but nothing crazy by any means.  My wife ordered a small pizza and so did our friend.  Wife ordered a chorizo pizza, it was OK, very light on the toppings compared to previous visits.  Our friend ordered a build your own with white sauce, it did not come with white sauce.  The person that dropped it off responded with \"it wasn't on the ticket\".  Ok, so no problem, we will walk ourselves up to check with the guy who took the order.  When we did, we got a blank stare, no offer to remake, no offer to do anything for that matter.  Not my kind of service.  I understand mistakes happen, for that I have no problem.  The problem is, you must correct that mistake if you want me to return to your establishment, they did not so that makes my decision easy.  Bottom line for me is, you are serving average pizza, you must make sure it is consistent and correct any mistakes you make, there are plenty of places to get average pizza.",

We were deciding between the margherita, pesto and the veggie setting on the large veggie.   The pizza here is baked fresh with fresh ingredients. Definitely makes a difference. Not the best pizza I have ever had but pretty good. I will definitely be back to try some other options.   I will say that the decor is a little iffy.

As for pizza, I got the chorizo pizza. I love that they put radish on the pizza because I thought it tasted great with it. Next time, I really want to try T-rex. I've heard many great things about it.  While this place isn't the cheapest pizza joint (a small 10' runs for about $10.95), it's definitely one of the best in Charlotte. I drove about an hour just to try this out and I'll do it again! Also, I came in around 4. That isn't quite rush hour or dinner time, so I got my food really fast.   It's more food than it seems so don't underestimate the size. You will be full!  PS. THERE IS WIFI! Check the cash register for the password.",

I'm a sucker for truffle oil and that paired with Cottonmill Farms Oyster mushrooms, Grande mozzarella cheese and Bianco-Dinapoli organic tomato sauce... delicious.  After eating there the first time I started reading about Pure Pizza, how their crust was made, where their ingredients come from and fell more in love with each sentence I read.  You've really got to read about their pizza (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.purepizzaclt.com%2Fabout-our-pizza&s=6e73532e446352adf982a1916d20c7fa8a0eaf4f94720ae10c6c7838fd78841b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">purepizzaclt.com/about-o...</a>) and just go try it for yourself.  Yesterday, I took my Mom there and she had the Deconstructed Pulled Pork (Dan the Pig Man pulled pork, Grande mozzarella cheese, house made cilantro lime cole slaw. Topped with a Secret Sauce) and I forced myself to switch it up and get The Chorizo (Chorizo, tomatoes, fresh organic shaved radishes, chopped onions, cilantro, and lime juice). Needless to say, there were no left overs.  Both times I got my boyfriend a standard Pepperoni to go. I was hesitant since he's usually not into a \"better option\" pizza, but he loved it as well.  Go, right now. What are you waiting for?",

We all spread out in search of yummy eats, and hubby and I were drawn to Pure Pizza for the aroma. Ordered a medium thin crust pepperoni and onion pizza and grabbed a seat right in front at the small bar area. They make a classic Neapolitan crust pizza, nice and thin. The pizza has a nice puffy (not burnt) edge. We usually leave what we call \"pizza bones,\" the outer edge of a pizza that's typically without much flavor. We found we consumed the entire pizza. Pepperoni was quite good. We watched Gino make all the pizzas, and you could tell he had decades of experience (confirmed after speaking with him for a moment.) It was fun to watch him. Some complained of the wait time. Gino cranked the pizzas out very quickly. We saw he was limited by how many he was able to fit in the oven. A little kindness goes a long way, people. A smile and a thumbs up to Gino and the rest of the gang was appreciated, and we appreciated the hot, tasty pizza!",

Unfortunately I asked for the ancient grains crust because its unusual and sounded good.  The overly healthy crust was not to my taste.  Suddenly Gino appeared (I believe he is the father or father in law of one of the owners) and noticed I wasn't eating much.  He immediately asked about the crust and said its not his favorite either.  He insisted on bringing me another pizza with their regular crust (also made from locally ground flour, but the white kind).  The second pizza was really great.  I ate one piece immediately fresh from the oven - awesome- and brought the rest back to my hotel.  heated up in the microwave tonight it was still good for dinner, but of course the microwave removes a bit of crispiness.   The public market is on the small side but the merchants seem sincere and really concerned with good quality local ingredients.   You can also get a nice glass of wine from the little wine bar, which I did, and it makes for a good light meal.",

I went at lunchtime on a weekday, and it wasn't that crowded (granted it was a Friday in the summer, when it seems to me like half of Charlotte doesn't go to work, so maybe it's busier other days). The 7th Street Market is a series of different, almost booth like, stores, from fresh juices, to a coffee bar, to a bakery to a butcher's case, and Pure Pizza is just about in the middle of it. You order up at the counter, and then site in a food court like area, and they bring the pizza out to you when it's done. It took a while for the pizza to come out, especially since I was on my lunch break, but once it arrived, it was well worth the wait! The 5 cheeses blended perfectly, but the best part was really the sprouted grain crust. They gave us a litle side of honey to dip the crust in, but it wasn't even needed, The crust had almost a baked in sweetness to it. I did dip in the honey once, but it was almost distracting from the full flavor the crust had on its own.  I ordered the 10\", to share with someone, and it was the perfect size. 3 regular sized (not those extra huge pieces you see sometimes now) for each person.  I loved the pizza, and I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Excellent pizza..best crust in CLT and the organic toppings run both to the traditional (pepperoni, sausage, etc) to the somewhat exotic (truffle oil, smoked salmon). Love both the special sauce (kind of like a spicy, chunky gazpacho) and the pepper-infused local honey to dip the crust in..both nice touches.  If I had a rub, it would be the price point. $12 for a 10 inch is a tad steep for where their digs are located (7th St Market) and the amentites provided.  That said, however, in this pizza-starved town of ours, the product really shines.",

    "text": "We stopped here as the place received great reviews on Yelp.  If you're not from Charlotte, this place is a little hard to find as nothing is really labeled on the street.  It was really nice looking from inside the market.  I knew the price of the pizza was going to be more than your standard pizza, but was willing to pay it based upon the great reviews they received.    Upon receiving the pizzas, I noticed that we did not get what we ordered (we received 2 plain cheese pizzas instead of specialty pizzas).  When I went back to inquire on this, they stated I was charged for a plain pizza and not a specialty pizza, and they messed up my order on accident (yet on the phone they repeated my order after I stated what I wanted, so I'm not sure how they could have messed it up).  They said they would make us new ones if I had 10 minutes to spare, but after already waiting to get the pizza I ordered, I did not have time to wait for them to correct their mistake. They should have refunded me my money for their mess up (that would have been better customer service).  Now the pizza, for being plain cheese, was not great.  The crust was very thin and almost rubber like. Now my kids eat just about any kind of pizza, and they would not eat this!    I would say pass on this place as it is just not worth the cost of the pizza with bland taste and bad customer service skills.",

    "text": "Juli, good news.  I've spoken with the fine folks over at Merriam-Webster and they have agreed to throw out the old definition of passive-aggressive and replace it with your reply.  Holy geez, that escalated quickly.  I don't feel I blasted your business at all.  I never said your employees were rude.  I made sure to make it known that your food is very good.  But perhaps I didn't make the lines far enough apart for you to read between.  So to clarify, one issue we have is the mystery pricing on the toppings.  I'm well aware that more toppings equal more money.  I'm just suggesting it would be nice to know how much money.  \"Starting at $1.50\" is vague.  I would just like to know is my sausage $1.50 or $2 or $3?  I don't like surprises when it comes to money...I doubt I'm alone on that. But the main issue we have is that your employees/managers are not empowered to the level that they should be.  I'm not a big groupon user.  I'm sorry I didn't know to scour the fine print for some arbitrary time that it was allowed.  But the fact is, we paid to park, we were there, we were hungry, we were looking forward to some great pizza, and it was not crowded at all...we were literally the only people eating at that time and it was only 45 minutes early.  So why draw a line in the sand on that when it would have taken 2 seconds to inform us of the time for future reference, work with us, and maintain a good relationship.  I'm sorry but that just makes sense to me.  If you want to go down with the \"you should have read the fine print\" ship, then by all means have at it.",

    "text": "Artisan pizza. It's a thing these days with healthy crusts, organic toppings, local ingredients. All of these things attracted me to Pure Pizza as well as the top-notch reviews. I tend to order gluten-free when possible so I tried the GF and also the sprouted crust for my first Pure experience. This is after searching their website's menu, speaking of which--thanks for putting up detailed listings of your delicious combos but HEY can you please put how much your pizzas cost and also what sizes are available!? This became problematic when calling to order because the online menu does not specify what sizes you can get certain crusts made with.  Meh. It was good, not great, but pretty good. The GF crust was crisp on the bottom but had a slight cream of wheat texture on top. Having eaten GF many times I get that it won't be like the \"real\" thing, Pure was definitely tasty but the texture still was, ummm, interesting. The ancient grain crust was also tasty but still was slightly lacking for non-GF pizza. I did however really like that they give you a side of locally-sourced honey to dip your crust with, this is something I never would've thought myself but quite enjoyed it.  If someone asked me to recommend a place to get GF pizza I'd recommend this place, but if someone asked to just recommend a good pizza place I'd tell them to head to Portofino's or Fuel first.",

I got the Margherita this time (though all their specialty pizzas look delicious... mmm). It's your basic tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil, but Pure Pizza does it so well! The mozzarella and basil are fresh and everything works so well together. The tomato sauce is bursting with flavor, but doesn't overpower the basil and cheese. The dipping oil on the side was a nice touch, too.  I love how Pure Pizza supports local causes, too! That gets 5 stars in my book! To sum it up, I can't wait to come back to Pure Pizza and try another pizza. 5 stars all around!",

One arrived 17 minutes after we ordered it and it looked like it had huge boils on it where the bread had swelled up and was burned without any toppings.  It looked like someone forgot to apply sunscreen (and by sunscreen I mean cheese) and it burned.  I'm used to seeing this on tourists at the beach, not on specialty pizzas.  Moreover, for a FIVE CHEESE pizza, there was surprisingly little cheese on it.  And although we were warned that the pizza had blue cheese (was she trying to scare us off?), it really tasted like generic mozzarella plus a little bit of goat.  I think we were missing three cheeses.  The delivery chick mumbled something when she dropped it off but I couldn't for the life of me catch a single syllable.    17 minutes was not great, but not the worst timing ever.  Our second pizza, however, didn't come out for another 12 minutes.  How is that possible?  We ordered two pizzas at the same time, but one came out AFTER an order placed SEVEN MINUTES AFTER US got their family sized pizza and drinks?  Well, if you are going to tell me that it just got stuck and/or forgotten in the oven all that time, you know, I might just have to agree with you.  It was even more burned than the first pizza.  And had even less cheese.  Seriously, less than half of the pizza had cheese on it.  Most of the pizza was either bare bread or just tomato sauce.  The ham was completely dried out and singed at the edges.  The roasted garlic was blackened.  CHARCOAL scrapings.    I was so annoyed, not the least at the ever-mumbling delivery person, that I wanted to walk it back to the counter and send it back.  Unfortunately, because it had taken so long, I had eaten most of the other pizza and my partner shoved the rest of this in his mouth so we could leave.    And we left crust.  That's how bad it was.  He NEVER leaves crust.  He's eaten my crust when it has sat on an uncovered plate in the fridge for three days being from a generic national chain.  And this after I had devoured most of his lunch in a feeble attempt to wait for my meal.  That's some bad crust...  P.S. Noted from another review that tipping is not expected here.  Keep that in mind, especially because if you tip before you actually get served, you might tip for terrible pizza and service.  They've got a tip jar on the counter--add to that after if you like what you've got.  Don't gamble ahead of time like I did.",

They make them with ricotta and mozzarella cheese, I could have done without the ricotta. All my pepperonis were clumped together so that was an annoyance.

Thank you once again fellow Yelpers for leading me to the promised land.   I took a moment to look at the menu. Still unsure of what to order, I asked the guy at the counter for a recommendation. He was super polite but no help. So I opted for wild mushroom pizza and substituted daiya for the mozzarella on the Neapolitan crust.   Accompanied by my pomegranate aranciata from Zia Pia (also in the market see review), I dug in with the best intentions to eat only half of the pizza. I failed miserably and ate it all. The crust was perfectly cooked and the perfect combination of soft, chewy and crispy. The mushrooms were perfectly seasoned and the truffle oil such depth to the flavor profile. The Daiya was perfectly cooked and gave the pizza a beautiful creaminess.   The pizza was so simple in its ingredient yet so wonderfully nuanced in its execution. It was worth the $15+ spent. I will most certainly be returning to partake in their pizzas in the very near future.",

    "text": "Great little pizza place in 7th Street market. I visited with my son after going to Imaginon across the street. I ordered the lunch special of a personal pepperoni pizza and drink for $8, I also checked in on Yelp and received a free order of their garlic knots.  The pizza took a little bit to come out (they are very busy during the lunch hour), but it was worth the wait.  The staff was friendly and helpful. Pizza was delicious. Definitely a new go-to for lunch when I'm in the area.",

    "text": "After attending one of Yelp Charlotte's \"Made\" series, I went back to the market and had a new appreciation for Pure Pizza.  I have had many instances of eating here and all have been very good.  They range from sharing an afternoon snack with friends, to dining solo during the weekday, or fighting the weekend crowds to hang out at the market.  It's almost as if the 7th Street Public Market is the perfect venue for Pure Pizza.  The casual environment, plus locally sourced ingredients, and the health conscious approach all makes for a delicious and uncompromising local business that I would recommend to anyone visiting or living in Charlotte.    It's amazing so much flavor comes out of that small space they operate out of.  I have been meaning to check out their newly opened 2nd location (stand-alone) on Central.    Order at the counter and you will get a number so that the friendly staff can locate you in the market to deliver your freshly-made pies of amazing-ness.  Your choices range from:  10 inch pizza, 16 inch pizza, or a 9in gluten-free pizza.  Don't forget to put your pan away in the designated spot/bin!",

It comes with tomatos, onions, banana peppers, chicken, and North Carolina barbecue sauce. The combination of banana peppers and Carolina sauce lead to a unique taste that I have never tasted. It was sweet, but also spicy. Would 100% recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a new experience.  My friend had the Shroomin Krueger sandwich and it was delicious as well!!!",

I've tried the original crust and the special \"ancient grain\" crust.  Both are a thin, chewy/grainy kind of feeling and have that oven fired taste.  They go easy on the sauce here, and there's an adequate amount of cheese (I personally like my pizzas to be dangerously cheesy, perhaps next time I'll just ask for it).  And definitely try dipping the crust in the chili-honey sauce, it's a nice touch.  Service is pretty quick, and the owner is super friendly.  It's a solid joint.",

    "text": "Overall good pizza, but extremely expensive. Their pepperoni specialty pizza is $15.95 for a small 12 inches! Add one extra topping, and now you're up to about $20 for a personal-sized pizza. On top of that, their payment system asks for a tip up front.  An up-front request for a tip always feels a little awkward to me. Also, I'm not sure what I'm tipping for, there isn't much service to actually tip for.  The pizza is dropped off at your table. Napkins? Plates? Condiments? Red pepper? All kept at the bar area.  Leave all your stuff alone on the table, trek back up to the bar, and get it all yourself. You are also expected to bus your own table.   The rest of the choices there are good, including their salads and sandwiches. All still very pricey.   Conclusion: good food, but you pay thru the nose for it. Is their pizza 3x as good as Fuel? Definitely not.",

It takes up the space of a pizza pan. I ordered the Greek with chicken. Order a protein. You won't regret it. My order came out really quick. My friends went to other places but I got mine first.   When it came out, someone even said \"Wow. That's a salad!\"  It was good. The ingredients were basic, but super fresh. And there was plenty of chicken which was tender and flavorful. Plenty of olives and feta, too! My only complaint is some of the lettuce pieces were too big and it was hard to eat.   I didn't check in until after I ordered, but you do get garlic knots for checking in. I'll use it next time.",

While I'll say that my first experience with Pure Pizza was one where I was pretty inebriated, I've been back since and it's never let me down.    Since I first drunkenly stumbled in, I've ordered the hot Italian sandwich.  It started as a random decision and now I refuse to try anything else.  It's that good.  Seriously, if you go just disregard the name of the restaurant and order the hot Italian sandwich.  And then next time you go back, you should probably try the pizza because I'm sure it's amazing too.    Awesome spot in 7SM and a regular go-to for me.",

Don't forget that you can park in their ramp for free (up To 90 minutes) when you validate your parking ticket at one of their stamping machines.  I will say their small pizza is a perfect size for one person and has a hand tossed crust. They also have a gluten free and sprout crust for a dollar more.   They also have salads which look pretty good and I might try one of them next time I'm at one of their locations to see if I like that a bit better.

Fresh and yummy with awesome combinations like truffle oil and mushrooms, or pepperoni with banana peppers and garlic.

I love the fact that they use natural, locally-sourced ingredients wherever possible. Meats, veg, even the flour for the dough is milled in NC. And naturally, they have local brews on tap (NoDa Red: if you haven't tried it yet, perfect with pizza).  You can do the simple, comfortable pizzas (cheese, pepperoni), but they also have some really inventive stuff. My visit, the pizza of the day was a field greens pie - cheese pizza with a locally-grown field greens mix on top. Everything comes to you hot and fresh, and it's hard to stop eating once you dig in. These guys know their stuff! If they offer you honey for your crust, take it. I've never dipped pizza crusts in honey before, but it works!  The staff are incredibly nice and make you feel welcome. Be sure to grab a pizza from Pure next time you are in the Market - you won't be disappointed.",

Well you don't have to have those thoughts at Pure Pizza. I don't know how they do it, but their crust is wheaty, the perfect amount of salty, hearty, and SOFT. On the top at least. The bottom has a perfect amount of crusty crunch.  I'm sure they calibrate their oven pretty regularly because this level of crust perfection is incredibly rare. I didn't want to oversell the place or \"get involved\" immediately but if you're the same sort of masochist and bite the plain crust before even getting into the sublime experience of the actual pizza like I did, you'll be happy.  We had the pizza supreme. Absolutely incredible. The thinly sliced garlic was the coup de grace. Plus the market it's in was awesome. Definitely give it a try.",

It was packed on a Friday for lunch when we went. I ordered the chorizo pizza on whole wheat and he ordered the Five cheese. The pizza came out in about 10 minutes, maybe a little longer but not a long wait. It looked beautiful, cooked perfectly and it tasted as good as it looked. Toppings were balanced and nothing overpowered another topping. The crust was very good and filling, the cinnamon honey dipping for the crust was AHMAZING. If I did have a complaint it would be the lack of sauce, maybe it is just the pizza I ordered I could see tomato sauce being awkward with the toppings of this pizza. However, I am a fiend for a good tomato sauce. The five cheese was equally as good. The cheese's were of great quality and stringed for days.   It was hard for me to choose which pizza to order because they have so many inventive selections like Smoked Salmon and pulled pork. I can not wait to try it again.",

    "text": "Pizza today is a tale of two cities- the one ordered en masse for speedy consumption by hungry hordes, the other on a smaller scale, as a chance for food artisans to show their chops, for everything from the crust to the mix of toppings showcased on top.  Pure Pizza, with its focus on locally-sourced ingredients, is new to town but quickly showing great promise amongst the artisan crowd.    Tucked into the 7th Street Market, Pure resembles little more than a food vendor at your local indoor mall, in that there is a counter and a series of glass guards separating you from the \"kitchen.\"  A menu board overhead describes the offerings and options available.  Seating is basic and plentiful in the middle of the market.  A quick look at the menu reveals a number of different pizzas and salads.  Pizzas come in 3 different sizes and in your choice of 2 different crusts- a basic white and a sprouted wheat/ancient grain.  Salads come in a choice of either a large or a small serving.  On my visit, the wife and I opted for a fresh arugula salad with goat cheese and a chorizo pizza on the sprouted wheat crust.  The salad was uber-fresh and bright with flavors.  With a lively lemon vinaigrette, it was like spring in bowl.  One minor quibble- the dressing was so cold the oils were semisolid, so we had to bring that up to temp a bit before pouring it over the salad.  The pizza, though, was brought out fresh from the oven and was worth the trip alone.  The crust had a great combination of crackling on the outside combined with a light and chewy interior.  That's no easy task with whole grains, but they have pulled it off well.  Choirzo was spicy and the cheese was a great contrast to it.  My favorite part?  The pepper-infused honey they give you to dip your crust into.  Unqiue and a great contrast to the savoriness of the pie.  Given that ingredients are farm-to-fork, it just adds to the experience to know you are eating seasonal and local foods that support area farmers.    Though we were stuffed, it was not hard to look up at the menu and imagine some of the other pizzas being equally good.  Everything from a classic margarita to a T-rex for the meat lovers sounded very good and will be worth a future visit.  Even breakfast is not out of the question as they have a smaller menu with 3 different pizzas there- each combining a egg on top of a pizza with as assortment of other ingredients.  Sounds tempting to me.  Given that Pure is right next to a bakery and with an artisnal coffee shop just across the way, you can get you fill and quench your foodie cravings all in one spot.  Combine that with 2 hour validated parking in uptown and you have a winner.  Pure is a welcome addition to the 7th Street Market and they fulfill a unqiue and developing niche in the pizza market.  Not a place to take the family when it's time for a quick dinner out, but a great spot for enjoying locally-sourced food prepared with skill and care.  Pure Pizza is so far pure goodness.",

I decided on a 3-Cheese pizza on traditional crust with a \"special sauce\". It was de-lish! My pizza was brought right to me as I waited at a small table in the 7th st market nearby. The gentleman who brought my pizza even asked me if I needed anything else, although I'm sure he didn't have to. The 7th St. Market seems to be very much self-serve.

She answered our questions and have recommendations.   I found a table while my partner ordered.  We waited a few minutes and they brought out the knots first followed with pizza a few minutes later.   The pizza was really good! The chorizo had such great flavors going on and the lasagna actually tasted like lasagna. Weird. I feel like that's a line from Willy Wonka. \"The snozberries taste like snozberries!\"   Anyway, overall it's a great little place to get delicious pizza in the market. They offer deals through Groupon and Yelp although we didn't use them. It's very casual and laid back atmosphere. Although if you want a table during peak times you might be out of luck.

    "text": "A friend invited me and my husband to the Top Chef challenge across the street from the 7th Street Market, and after she RAVED this was her favorite pizza in Charlotte, we had to try out a few Pure pizzas.   The setup of pure is like a food court-- order at the counter, and take a seat, and wait for your food. The pies took no time to come out.   We tried the pulled pork pizza, which was divine.  The dough so chewy and crisp, and slightly sweet.  The pie is topped with pickled cabbage for a nice fresh crisp and tang.    The chorizo pizza was flavor packed too...as was the simple tomato and cheese.    BTW: Each pizza comes with a tiny container of local honey.  Honey!  To dip your crust.  Even folks who aren't crust eaters will appreciate the touch.    BTW Part 2: If you can't make it down to the market, Pure made an appearance at the last Chow Down food truck rally.   BTW Part 3:  We had the regular crust and the sprouted...and honestly, there's not much difference when your pizza's got so many toppings and intense flavors.  I'd try both...the sprouted just makes you feel healthier :-)",

The setup is nice; you order & pay at the same place & everything is made right there in plain view.   And the choices...you have plenty! They offer several tasty options for specialty pizzas, but you can make your own as well.  They also offer options for salads, but you can make your own, too.  We decided to go with the 10\" Pepperoni Supreme with the original crust (you can also choose whole wheat crust), which gave us four pieces total - & nice sized four pieces at that. I love that they use local ingredients.  The employees are friendly & attentive...& quick. We didn't have to wait long to get out pizza.  It was hot & fresh & ooooh....they give you a small container of honey for the crust! It's the little things! The pizza was delicious. The crust wasn't extremely \"dough-y\", which is good.  Seating is plentiful, but you're sharing that common area with the other vendors - so beware, it may get busy.  They have a cooler full of drinks...soft drinks, wine, the yummy Dr. Brown sodas, & water, among other choices.  I'm really pleased with Pure Pizza & will definitely be back!",

The pizza was made perfectly with good crust and a great selection of cheeses.  We really enjoyed the food and the staff was friendly and helpful.  The yelp deals made this a great deal.  Will eat here again!    One note, the 5 cheese isn't sauced with a red base, so if that's what you are wanting Try another pizza from their selection.",

It's not very often that you come across a restaurant with great gluten free options, but to come across a pizza place that offers gluten free is almost unheard of. It's not just a regular pizza place either, this is all organic - local - farm fresh - deliciousness!  Guilt free carbs if you will :) We will be back and are letting all our vegan, vegetarian and gluten free friends know about this hot spot.  PS - They carry Vegan cheese for those who are also dairy free.",

    "text": "So, I've to this place a couple of times, LivingSocial coupon in hand, because they have gluten-free pizza, which the beau needs. The verdict: You NEED this pizza in your life!  One of my biggest dislikes about pizza in general is how greasy it usually is. Heavy, sits like a brick, makes you feel squicky for the rest of the day. Not so for Pure Pizza! It was light, airy, and surprisingly grease-free like I have never seen before. I could eat until I'm full and not feel totally disgusting afterward. Which I totally did.  Their gluten-free dough option is quite fluffy and holds up well. It even has an interesting whole-grain sort of taste that quickly grows on you. As someone who typically eats regular glutenous bread, I actually really like it.  Without a doubt, the Deconstructed Pulled Pork pizza is the BEST. God, I'm craving it as I type. The crispy, salty pork with the crunchy, sweet slaw on top of that soft, cheesy bread? I could eat it every day. I don't even usually like slaw. This stuff is seriously fresh. I can't get over it. The T-Rex is also a tasty option for you carnivores out there. It's positively sprawling with delicious meats and won't leave you disappointed.  The only complaint I have is that the employees are a bit aloof and not very friendly. But I can get over that, for the food. Pure Pizza is more like a savory pastry rather than an artery-clogging guilt machine. They've got a return customer for sure.  Be sure to get your parking ticket validated! The machine is over by the bulletin board near the door to the parking garage.",

    "text": "Yeah, two stars and that's all it deserves! Sure the food is really tasty but that is really all Pure Pizza has going for it.  Look I get the whole organic/granola/hipster thing everyone is into these days. I like that we are getting back to real foods with real names from real people. But honestly this \"market\" aka \"food court\" is a prepackaged sterile side show! Its located in the heart of downtown Charlotte, and has the typical chalk board menus, old style metal chairs, and hokey 'barn' carts to hold food items. The walls are covered with images of vegetalbles/flowers/smiling people/and all that organic stuff. There are about 10 other shops in there (coffee, sushi, meat, wine, pizza, desserts, etc) and each one is playing on the farm local organic vibe. But come on people this was hand picked by marketing and designers to make you FEEL like your in an old world market/little farm town. And its specifically designed to pull in the younger crowd working in downtown that wants to be a part of that image.  Let me get off my soap box and talk about Pure Pizza. I ordered a medium and 3 bottled waters for a total of $24. The cost was a little high, but I thought maybe the pizza would be all that other Yelpers had raved about. I figured that would be more than enough for my wife and toddler to enjoy. Anyway, yes I did enjoy the pizza, but it was more like a small in the realm of pizzas. On top of that these pizzas are thin crust, no not crazy paper thin, but thinner than I was expecting and from seeing it I knew it would not be enough for my family. Regardless though the pizza was super tasty with a great crust and the honey to dip the crust in was a very pleasing. But all it did was make me want like 2 more pizzas! But I was not about to drop almost $75 dollars on a lunch! And how much were those stinking bottled waters!?! They weren't even anything special and actually they were super cheap bottled waters with caps that were annoying to take off. But whatever the pizza although amazing on taste is too expensive for the amount you get.   Yeah I know all organic and free range and vegan with no preservatives and high fructose corn syrup is worth the extra coin. But I can't recommend this place because of the cost:food ratio. It's that simple! In addition to the prepackaged 'market' theme that your immersed in... its just to fake for me.   There are better values in Charlotte than Pure Pizza. I'd rather go to the Penguin for some True local flavor!!",

It's sheer genius...and as a consumer of many a \"wild mushroom pizza,\" I have significant field experience.   Truly a magnificent pizza. I love the execution, and the accompanying video playing on loop that shows where exactly the mushrooms come from...come ON! This little locavore is a happy camper.  I must also give a shout out to the croutons (thanks to a sweet young lady working there who recommended adding them to a salad) as well as the lemon vinaigrette dressing. I'd eat just those two in a bowl and die of delight.  I've tried a few other pizzas there, and they've all been swell.   There's also honey dipping sauce for your crusts...why isn't EVERYONE else doing this? It's so brilliant...and makes the crispy crust taste into a post-slice dessert. The sprouted ancient grain crust is also worth trying...only available in the smaller pizza options, though.  Pure is a favorite of mine when I'm hungry and in the uptown area.    **for the vegans, they have daiya and can make many of the pizzas vegan-friendly with no loss of flavor!",

So there was this $10 for $20 Groupon deal for this place that came up on my phone. Because I hadn't heard of this place before I looked it up on Yelp and saw the reviews. Me and my boyfriend headed to this place the following weekend and ordered a large pizza, half Wild Mushroom, half Pure Country. Because everyone was raving about their sprouted grain crust we asked for that, unfortunately they don't do that for the large pizzas. Fortunately, their regular crust tastes delicious too! The Wild Mushroom is my #1 at this place. It is also my boyfriend's favorite, and did I mention, he DISLIKES mushrooms? Go figure!  The second time we went here we got so greedy, we ordered two large pizzas, thinking we would have them for lunch the following few days, and we did. The second time we did half Pepperoni Supreme, half T-Rex and a while Wild Mushroom! Oh Mother of God, that was like the best pizza weekend ever! Also, I really like how they give you honey and cinnamon sugar with the pizza to dip the crust in at the end. I enjoyed that part so much (especially since I throw away all the crust or give it to my boyfriend), that I started doing that with all pizzas I get from other stores. But no, sadly that doesn't taste so great with other pizza places. This place really has some magic ingredient in their crust, next time I'm seriously considering getting my pizza half wild mushroom, half plain crust!",

You walk up, and the menu is written on a chalkboard and it takes some time to process, the lady at the register was really great about answering questions and suggested that I try the \"Slap yo Mama Lasagna\" which I had on Ancient Sprouted Grain dough.  The pizza came out in record time and was chock full of tasty fare.  Ground beef, mozzarella cheese, basil, onions, and the tastiest damn tomato sauce I have had on a pizza yet.  The ancient sprouted grain dough was flavorful and had a nice rise to it which gave the pizza the right amount of fluff.  I got the small which was plenty and was glad I did.    I like places like this, and hope that it is successful since I will be come a more frequent customer.  It is appealing to me that there are many other neat places to check out while I'm there which makes this experience well worth the trip.  Great stuff Y'all!!!",

    "text": "I'm not sure if I ate the same pizza as the other people who left reviews? Ordered garlic knots and a med 1/2 pep supreme and  1/2 bacon. The bacon was totally raw, they forgot the peperoncinis and the pizza (and garlic knots) were incredibly grease soaked. Brought the raw bacon to their attention and they said it comes in pre cooked. I'm telling you the bacon looked raw, was totally limp and slimy. This was not a good pizza.  In regard to the owners reply - your staff explained that the bacon comes in precooked so you should educated them not me on your process. Regardless how you prepare it - not good.   Secondly, yes a review can be damaging but that's what this forum is for - to tell about your experience and mine was not a good one.   Lastly, you should have left it at offering a redo but then following up with a lecture on my opinion and stating what your staff said left me with a 2nd bad impression.",

    "text": "The gluten free \"Garlic\" bread sticks did not have an ounce of garlic in or on them. It was basically just a flat pizza bread crust with a very over-whelming flavor of oregano and basil, the marinara sauce was good tho, but it would have been better if the bread came even hot, it was stone cold bread.   Now the pizza...same crust as the not so garlic bread, and still that flavor of the bread masked the ingredients of the cheeses and spinach on my Mediterranean pizza. And I don't like a spongy texture for my crust as this one had, and was also burnt underneath. At least It was warm...not hot how i like pizza, but warm.  The only thing good was the honey they give you for dipping your crust in.  Now, the drink selection was limited, we got the very last coke...how do you run out of coke??? No ice, no lemons...and the coke had high fructose corn syrup in it where as my sprite was actually with real sugar...so they should have had at lest some consistency with their drink products...*sigh, not very satisfying at all.  And even as I write this, it has taken my bill at least 20 mins to get back to me or even more. On a thurs night they were busy, limited parking spaces, and very loud! Should have sat out side.",

    "text": "Pizza was adequate but if I could, I would give a ZERO rating for customer service. We were visiting from Southern California and my friend's family took us here for lunch. My friend ordered a pizza with goat cheese because it's the only cheese she can have. When it came out with regular mozzarella, she tried to bring it back to the counter, and GENO was so aggressively rude and disrespectful that he had made my friend cry. How he could have the audacity to yell, gesture, snatch the pizza away, and slam it into the garbage like he did was unacceptable and offensive. Only after noticing that he had made her cry did he come out to our table to apologize and offer a gift card. Even if we lived there, he is enough reason to never give Pure Pizza our business again. Thanks but NO thanks.  Also, if you're going to act like that, please stop telling people you are from New Jersey. You are giving all of us a bad name.",

    "text": "I don't know about you but my craving for Pizza is always coupled with immense guilt for wanting something so unhealthy! not any more though... =)  the Pizzas at Pure are not only delicious, but even after you have devoured an entire pizza you won't get up from your chair feeling overly full or bloated or gross! it probably has to do with the fact that they use fresh / local / organic (when possible) ingredients, and they keep the pizzas simple - thin crusts, moderate toppings, but a good / creative variety to choose from. Yes, I do think the pizzas are a little pricey for what they are; but there's no harm in treating yourself to some delicious, non guilt inducing pizza once in a while! my favorite, is the simplest one on their menu - the margarita pizza with honey on the side. If you're looking for a non tomato based one, the wild mushroom pizza is great. Their pepperoni supreme is pretty good as well, though I thought the pure country one could definitely use a little more prosciutto on it. Their menu also includes sandwiches, calzones and salads - may be I'll get to those some day, but for now I'm sticking with the pizza!",

The ingredients are fresh and they even give you some local honey to dip the yummy crust into.  We always get the large to get the True Neapolitan Crust.  What makes this place even more wonderful is we always see the owner working back there with the rest of his team.  This is a labor of love for him.",

But the pizza was good, the crust was soggy though, it might be because it had a crap ton of toppings. Whatevs, worth trying if you haven't been, we'll prob be back. The pizza was pretty good.

    "text": "After all of my camping out at 7th Street Market, I finally made it over to Pure for lunch. After seeing multiple delicious pizzas make their rounds throughout the market to tables seated with happily expectant guests, the time was nigh.  Hanging out on a Saturday morning at the market is great. Tons of hustle and bustle. Hungry folks exploring the various vendors and stands. We enjoyed the morning crowd and had an early lunch.   My wife ordered the mushroom on the sprouted ancient grain crust and I ordered the chorizo pie on the traditional white crust. The mushroom had incredible, robust aromatics. Local shitaki mushrooms and a nice whisper of truffle. The crust is thin and chewy with tons of grainy flavor. That subtle truffle oil flavor....heaven. The chorizo was great. I appreciated the lime wedge to squeeze over the pie. It added the needed sourness to enhance the other savory flavors. I enjoyed chorizo, but the mushroom definitely took first prize of the two. Easily one of the best craft pizzas I've had in the QC.  They also have some great drink choices. Ting? I haven't seen this except at Jamaican restaurants and ethnic markets! How cool! I LOVE Ting. I used to drink it as a kid. It's a nice, perky flavor and works well with the pizza.   Price point is very fair for the craft they churn out, they bring the pizza to you where ever you are in the market, and you can even custom your pie to the world's end. I'm so stoked this place set up in the 7th Street Market!  Very much looking forward to going back. Cheers!",
