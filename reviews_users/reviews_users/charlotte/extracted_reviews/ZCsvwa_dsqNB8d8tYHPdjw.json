I've gone there a bunch of times, and I really like the outdoor patio seating, especially the big cherry tree that has such beautiful blossoms in the spring and would be the perfect place to take a chick on a first or second date, and they do have a descent selection of brew on draught, I do like Ye Old Speckled Hen, but well, their food sucks.  The last time I went there I ordered the fish and chips, mainly cause this is a pub and I was feeling nostalgic for my days in London, so I wanted some fish and chips, and thought they might actually be good...Wrong!  The fish and the batter were uncooked, and I had to send it back not once, not twice, not three times, but four times, and on the last time, it still wasn't right I just didn't feel like sitting there anymore, and my brother had already finished his burger, which did look good.  Did the waitress offer me anything for my trouble, nope.  Which brings me to my next complaint, the service and the whole atmosphere is really kind of rude, and stuffy, maybe I'm just not cool enough, but they always seem to busy to serve me, and the whole low ceiling basement bar thing is not my bag.  Other people love Sir Edmond's, I know I've heard rave reviews for their burgers and their lamb sandwich, this place just isn't for me.",

    "text": "The patio is nice! If you are looking for a cozy place to go sit outside that isn't next to a busy street, this is a good place to go. They do not allow cigar smoking until after 10 o'clock PM though, (even outside) so if you are looking for a place to enjoy a cigar, keep that in mind. The menu is unusual with a variety of different fares like goat cheese friiters, Buffalo chili and Ahi Tuna. I had the fritters and a plate of Ostrich tacos. The fritters were interesting (quite rich though) and I would have them again, but they were \"missing something\". I felt that way about the tacos as well but quickly rectified that with the addition of the garlic chili paste. The garlic chili paste turned the *okay*  tacos into something spectacular! I will eat there again, but will mostly be going for the on draught Hobgoblin Ale and the patio. (they have draught Belhaven and some other quality European beers as well) I have read mixed reviews about the service there but would have to say that my experience was excellent. The staff was welcoming, informed about the menu and took time to see that I was a happy customer. I went on a Tuesday night, that may have somethig to do with it. Pricing was a little high (38 dollars for Ostrich tacos, goat cheese fritters, and three pints of Hobgoblin) but that was not surprising to me since it isn't your typical \"bar food\" and Bud.  I will definitely go there again simply because I liked the place and the people, but I see it more as a cool bar/patio than a destination restaurant.",

    "text": "It's been years since I've been to Sir Ed's but I remember it more as a English Pub with more British food options than what I saw on the menu tonight.  Like some have said, finding the place can be a challenge but the restaurant fits in it's little nook, just nicely and even has a nice outdoor patio to compliment the restaurant.  Inside its dark with dark woods at the bar and a long bench along the front wall.  Tables are big but the wood bench is very uncomfortable.  The menu is actually very diverse with 1/2 of it being vegetarian options but missing from it is Shepherd's pie, bangers and mash and a few other British staples.  Our group started out with black bean an d roasted vegetable nachos which were a bit scarce on the black beans and roasted vegetables.  We also had the goat cheese fritters which were tasty but  bit dry.  For the entree, i went with something non-traditional because like I said, the traditional options are scarce.  I had the cod tacos.   The coating on the cod was overcooked and hard and crunchy.  The salsa on the tacos was flavorful but the tortillas were dry and a little rubbery.  They could have been steamed to loosen them up a little.  Also a sauce would have been nice on the taco.  They gave me a tiny slice of lime but the lime was dry and the skin was brown which was quite unappetizing.  The fries were good but it's hard to ruin fries.  Others at my table had the broccoli parmesan, the french dip and the chicken fried chicken....all items i wouldn't expect at an English pub.  The service was good but the menu just left me wanting to go over to Big Ben's.  Sorry, Sir Ed.",

    "text": "People have to remember that this is a pub!! Also it's technically an English pub not Irish... My best friend and I have been coming here for years and YEARS, like years before smoking was banned.  This is our go to spot for catching up, relaxing, girl talk, game nights, etc. We don't come as often as we used to but when we do they still remember who we are which is awesome. They also have one of the best patios around. It's beautiful, cozy, and comfortable. The waitstaff and the bartenders always do an amazing job for us and coming here is always good.  Okay so on to the food... I've tried practically everything on the menu at one point or another and they will update their menus frequently to bring back some of our favorites. I came the other day with a friend and found the buffalo sloppy joe was back. I took a picture and sent it to the BFF as it's her favorite. Needless to say a few days later she and I took an after work trip to Sir Ed's!!  Some of my favorites include: jabari wings; Thai beef wontons; hong kong egg rolls; potato cakes; jamaican jerk chicken nachos; tomato soup; BLT; Shepards Pie; Ostrich Meatloaf; black bean veggie burger; and of course the bacon cheeseburger. They've had some other things over the course of the years that have been good as well. Their fries are great and the ranch dressing is addictive. *Thai beef wontons are seasonal and not on the menu currently*  Their fish and chips have never been very good nor have their chicken fingers. No one I know who has had either has like those dishes, pretty much always over cooked and just something about them isn't good.  The Guinness stew is sometimes great and sometimes not so great. I know I love this place and the people here but have to be honest about the food lol.   Their beer selection is great and their wine selection is pretty good too. So if you're looking for a cozy English pub atmosphere with some interesting food choices that's out of the way of the hustle and bustle then this is definitely the place for you!!.",

    "text": "Well, tucked away in Park Road shopping center is this older Charlotte restaurant. Now we were a large party of 12 in a back room--but they should have given us a dedicated waiter. We had a nice girl but....she was also working the patio ( pretty far from us) and I also saw her behind the bar. So starting off ..the Service..bad..almost none..now there was a couple of different food runners, so maybe they should train them in to be waiters. I was never asked and could never gain the waiters attention to order a drink. I had water all night. A kind of strange menu with some nice vegitarian choices and then a few english pub items. I ordered  a GRILLED CHEESE. Now as far back as I can remember ..a GRILLED CHEESE is GRILLED...Nope ..not this one. I had asked for Bacon instead of how it was listed as a Black Forest Ham and Havarti Grilled Cheese.  Well, it came on WHITE Bread ..(listed on the menu as multi grain ) and it had two small four inch pieces on on half and a half a slice of cheese. and then One four inch strip on the other half with the other half slice of cheese. Bread was dry..was supposed to have mustard. AND TOTALLY UNGRILLED! It took me a minute to try and see what the sandwich was about ...NOTHING...not at all a 6.95 ADULT GRILLED CHEESE as it said on my check With  1.50 extra charged for BACON..which  I would be surprised if it amounted to a whole slice. That paired with nothing to drink but water..would have normally caused me to exit but it was a birthday party and I was invited so I stayed. The whole idea of a grilled cheese is the toasted buttery exterior of the bread and the melty cheese inside. NADA..not here.  The other guests were not too happy with their entrees either..Only one Appetizer was liked by all and that was the Buffalo Fried Cauliflower , .Bad Reuben Sandwiches..which is kind of English, very mediocre Fish and Chips and a Dry French dip. I won't be traveling back to the rear of Park Road Shopping Center again...Sorry ED!",

Thoroughly confusing introduction to what's supposed to be a well-loved English pub.  Seeing as there were only six customers inside but the patio was packed, the best reason to go is to enjoy a draught Guiness in the outdoor seating.    I wanted food and word on the street is they're under new management and reinstated their traditional menu.  So I hankered to try their shepherd's pie.  The online menu is not current and meat pie is nowhere to be seen.    The new menu has things like egg rolls with spicy sauce.  If they are trying to cook what the new chef is good at, they're still missed the mark.  The new items are mediocre at best.  It doesn't take Gordon Ramsay to know they should throw the new menu out the window and get back to English basics.    Don't get the burger if you're used to Big Daddy's or The Burger Co!  The patty and fries tasted pre-fab frozen.  Definitely had bad tummy the rest of the evening.  The whiskey selection is next to nil.  If friends want to go again I'll try the fish and chips but I won't get my hopes up.  And I wouldn't call it an English restaurant anymore or even a \"pub\" judging the current state of affairs.",

Only reason for the 2 star review is for the inconsistencies. One night you'll get amazing service, the next night you'll get a server that seems like he/she (usually she) hates his/her life. They have an awesome menu with several vegetarian options. Really enjoy this place, just wish the friendliness came out a little more on a consistent basis. It's also nice too have a late night food menu option!  My go to's:   Roasted Vegetables and Black Bean Nachos - it's not often you find a solid nacho option that doesn't have beef or chicken.

I ordered a hamburger with no mustard, no mayo, and cheddar cheese. It came out with swiss cheese (not a big deal,) but it also had mustard and mayo. I let the server know, and I must note that I was not mean or rude about it at all. Mistakes happen.  The burger came back moments later with cheddar cheese slapped on top of the swiss, and the mustard and mayo gone..... How does someone get mustard and mayo out of the nooks and crannies of a burger.....? By rinsing it with water, I presume. So the burger came back cold, slightly wet, cheddar cheese (not melted) on top of the old cheese. Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting. The server said nothing, even when he saw me not even take one bite. After approaching the manager, she took it off the bill.   I am not saying that I need anything for free, but I did come there to eat, left hungrier than I arrived, and then STILL had to go through the chick-fil-a drive thru after paying $30 for 2 drinks and the meal of the other person at the table.

A batch of friends and I have only recently started attending on the semi-regular, a few times for Monday night trivia, and on another occasion just to sit and grab a drink and some food. Each time, we've had a blast.  The atmosphere is quiet and friendly, which is an extremely welcome change to some of the other bars we've frequented.  We call it our neighborhood 'Cheers', since it feels like the kind of place you can easily become a welcome regular, where the staff will remember you, and treat you well regardless of what you're ordering. Service has always been good - a few minor delays once in a while on busy trivia nights, but totally understandable.   The food is very, very acceptable. It is largely comprised of bar grub, but it's done well; no, it's likely not going to be comparable to a dining establishment whose focus is solely food - but they have a surprisingly extensive menu (another Yelper complained about a lack of menu options, which I think is unTrue) featuring lots of share-worthy appys, a wide variety of burgers and sandwiches, and some surprising main dishes including Chicken Curry (I can't directly comment, but a friend got the curry sauce with a basket of fries, and said it was awesome.), among other more predictable choices like Fish & Chips and Shepherd's Pie. Friends have enjoyed their Chicken Tender baskets, which come with their thick-cut steak fries (which are delicious). Another friend's side salads have featured an impressive diversity of greens and fresh-looking toppings; definitely not one of those substandard iceberg mixes that some places try to get away with. My Turkey Burger was flavor-balanced well with its herbed goat cheese and sliced apple toppings, and was a good size - not overwhelmingly big such that I felt like food was my personal enemy after consuming it (Bad Daddy's, I'm looking at you). Husband was also impressed with his Blackened Cod taco plate, which I did not try, but looked nicely put-together. Another friend said the Buffalo Shrimp appetizer was good, but a little skimpy in comparison to some other orders, and would be better rounded out by a side of fries (as comes with the Chicken Tenders). Vegetarians, fear not! They have at least a few veggie options that aren't completely boring for you to choose from, too.  They pour a generous pint, and have a variety of size options for you to mix and match how much you're in the mood to drink that evening - half pint's, \"American\" pints, English pints, and more. If you're not in the mood for harder stuff, soda refills come fast and furious.  Re: trivia, so far theirs is the best we've found in Charlotte. They're not part of a big nation-wide group like the Team Trivia at Jackalope Jack's, but we like their setup better; a Charlotte entertainment group, \"Merely Players\", puts it on, and every Monday on their Facebook page they list 3 topics from the upcoming evening's 7 rounds, so you can get in a little on-point cramming before you get there. We tried to visit Ed's Tavern on a Thursday night to compare the trivia there, but were chased away by the headache-inducing music, overall noisy atmosphere and lack of open seating.  Sir Edmond's is a recently-discovered jewel to us and our friends, and we only feel sad that we had not tried it sooner. It's quickly become part of our weekly repertoire in Charlotte, and hopefully will continue to be so for many years to come.",

The food leaves room for improvement- or many it was just what we ordered as our friends seemed to enjoy their meals.  I got the fish tacos which were SO spicy I couldn't eat them.  I love spicy food, but this was really overkill.  It was inedible and I literally couldn't taste any of the flavors because of the overwhelming spice on the fish.  My husband got a burger that was charred.  We both didn't finish our meals.  Apparently the Shepard's Pie was good according to our friends, but I didn't try it, so I can't say for sure.  I would definitely be careful what you order though.",

She wanted to check it out, being a nice night and the patio is a nice treat. We arrived at 6:30 and got the last open table outside. After 10 minutes we were brought menus and water, one short. From there it took us over 20 minutes to place our order, which included having to ask the drink specials, and what was on tap, & the waitress said \"it's on the back of the menu\". After reviewing we ordered and waited another 45 minutes for our meal, which came out incorrect. It was corrected immediately, however, the server was very rude and short with everything! I also need to note, sitting outside offers smoking, so be warned. We, unfortunately sat @ two tables that included chain smokers...somewhat annoying while you are trying to enjoy a drink and dinner.  As far as the food, I ordered the zucchini cake, which was undercooked, however, the others ordered the fish & chips, amazing. I will make sure I enjoy that dish if I return. Overall the food was good, but the service was so disappointing.",

The menu was still an intriguing mix of traditional Irish fair and unique dishes like locally sourced ostrich and butternut squash croquettes.  We could not tell if our apps were frozen out of a box, but wondered.  The \"Brie Fondue\" was like watered down thousand island dressing, only with less flavor.  The Roasted Beet Soup seemed like nothing more than beets put into a blender, no seasoning to bring out the smokey sweetness roasted beets have. The entrees were better; Enjoyable but nothing to write home about.  Based purely on food quality the rating would have been average... But for $60, the value factor drops it to a poor.  It saddened me because this place was a gem.  Hopefully, it was just an off night.",

I really don't think I've ever had such a rude waitress.   One of the many instances where she was rude was when she messed up my order. I politely asked about the missing cheese in my order of cheese fries. After she picked up the plate, my friend asked for his appetizer (she brought my order but hadn't taken his). She cut him off y sternly saying, \"How about I fix his fries first before they get cold?!\" Then walked away. When she brought them back, she said, \"Next time you want cheese, tell me!\" Our entire group was speechless.  I have never had a worse experience at any restaurant in my life. I highly recommend you avoid the place.",

My personal favorite is the zucchini cake with ratatouille. It hits the spot and keeps you full without feeling ver indulgent. My friends usually order the ostrich meatloaf, but it is a bit much for me.  The bar is always a hit, with surprising local beer choices on tap along with the usual suspects like Guinness. Sir Ed's also sports a nice patio for mild days and a dart board in the back for play time.",

Excited to be seated, we were not sure if we seat ourselves or see a hostess.  This was obstacle #1.  After awkwardly standing around for a while we were finally helped and sat.  Long story short: we both got the Rueben, which was good.  But then again, how hard is it to mess up a Rueben?  It was served with fries (a very small amount) and they have malt vinegar on the table for your fries.  Score!  Although the food was decent, the service was not.  I had to ask for refills on my water multiple times, ask for the check, and ask her to run our cards.    I'm hoping it was an off day as this place SEEMS as though it could be a hidden gem.",

She replied it is the same as the dining room????? We both have been in the restaurant business for over 20 years.  I just really don't understand how this level of service can happen.

I think what made it even better was that my hip(-ster), musical, \"cool\" (in the Truest sense of the word) cousin in Charlotte suggested we meet there for a drink while I was in town for the night. The fact that this place has his approval is not to be taken lightly.  Okay, so here's the deal. Our party of four sat at a table and just ordered drinks. I don't think that is a particularly big deal, but our waitress made multiple references to this fact, and expressed her displeasure. I mean, sure, a bigger total means a bigger tip, but ordering multiple drinks is just as good in my book. I didn't appreciate how her parting words were \"Y'all promise to order some food next time, right?\" -- not the way to win customers' hearts.   I liked that this was off the beaten path (or at least it felt that way, we had enough trouble finding it). I think that adds to its appeal. So, all in all, I think it's a \"cool\" place to grab a drink but nothing I would necessarily seek out.",

Because of the heat, we wanted salads, but also a little extra to soak up that wine.  So, we each got an appetizer.  My friend got buffalo shrimp.  They also featured buffalo cauliflower, which my heat craving taste buds longed for.  But since we were sharing, I got the butternut squash croquettes with the Brie fondue. Our salad arrived crisp and fresh.  Because I make my own salad dressing at home out of healthy and minimal ingredients, I typically choose yummy, decadent blue cheese dressing when dining out.  And good it was! The butternut croquettes were fried crunchy with a sweet, soft center.  The Brie fondue was an extra good added touch.  My friend agreed. Which leads me to my friend.  The buffalo shrimp must have been extra good because she did not offer to share with me.  As she was munching on one of my croquettes, I looked at her plate to see only shrimp tails left!  As a woman who is always in search of hot and spicy food, I found myself regretting that I did not order the buffalo cauliflower. Next time...",

I do not think I have had a bad thing on the menu and I have tried most of it. I love coming for a late night bite and a pint or there have been several occasions where I have come for dinner itself. The burger is very well seasoned and is one of the best straight up cheeseburgers in Charlotte. Some of the more traditional UK food like Shepard's Pie and Bangers and Mash are also very well done here. I have Bangers and Mash every Christmas (100+ year-old family tradition) and this place definitely does it well. I'm not a fish person but I have heard the Fish and Chips is spot on too.

Sir Ed's has a large bar with lots of beers and and an adequate on tap selection.  My favorite appetizer here is the Irish Potato Cakes ($6.50). Two large crusty cakes with a warm herb goat cheese sauce. Delish!   I usually order the Spicy Asparagus & Portabella Grilled Cheese ($8.25).  This sammich is served on sourdough. It's a nice change from your typical grilled cheese. The veggies inside are perfect, but I wouldn't exactly call them spicy.

The weather is great but the service mediocre at best. I ordered a salad and the Fish n Chips. As I waited for a long time for the salad I realized that the salad would likely come out with the entree: BINGO! The waitress brought them together and placed them on my table.   I told her the salad shouldn't be served with the Fish n Chips and she told me that's how the kitchen put them up for her. I said they know better and so should you. I asked her to remove the salad. Five minutes later she came back and told me the salad had been taken off my check. REALLY??? Did they think I'd consider paying for a salad I sent back?   I told her if someone cared they would have come out to talk to me. No one cared or came.   Food 3, service 1....for me that's 1 star and I won't be back.",

You never know what type of service or company you'll end up with around a pub quiz. This was a ton of fun. The servers and bar tender are totally into it and are jovial while not ignoring their guests. We were seated at the bar and the bar tender had no problem answering questions and making recommendations while also cracking jokes to the trivia. The crowd (apparently thick tonight due to the 2hr delay tomorrow from the arctic vortex), was jovial and good spirited. Everyone cracked jokes, cheered, and made small talk if not entire conversations. There are 4-5 rounds to the trivia and the topics range from history to music to movies to pictures - a little something for everyone to flex their muscles. We will definitely be making trivia night here more of a regular thing (even if I pre-game dinner and just do dessert).",

The patio is like a nice tucked away English garden that can make you forget where you are. - Food - we had a special (blackened scallops) that was way, way tasty versus \"bar food\" and an excellent value.  Beer in proper Imperial pints always works for me, too.  I'm easy that way.  The vibe here actually reminded me several places near where I once lived in London, and many of the complaints in less favorable reviews... only bolstered that impression!",

I almost rated it a \"4\" at first, due solely to the price point, but after tasting their food... and watching them build a perfect pint of Guinness - head rising proud of the rim, built in two parts, and the cascade proving they have their gases mixed properly... It gets a 5. It is a bit of a drive from my house, but I'll be making it. Probably weekly...Maybe on Mondays for Trivia night?",

I like to try different places and could not locate the deli. So off to Park Road Shopping Center. I use to work in this area and never knew this place was here. A little hard to find but it is by Rack room , a path and down some stairs. . I was so glad the 4 in my group went. We were not sure if we wanted to eat inside or out and opted for inside. it seemed a bit dark at first but after your eyes adjusted, it was fine.  I was so glad to be here. It was quiet and I knew Deli would be noisy.  We all ordered something different. We all enjoyed what we had which was , Portebello Mushrooms sandwich, the pesto chicken sandwich. a BLT and I had the Reuben. Two had the sweet potato fries and they were nice and thick,not stringy or small. Myself and other party had the cup of tomato soup, delicious.  My Reuben although not on rye bread was very good. Corned beef was excellent. Only note is that when I got ready to eat the second half it had become a bit soggy. No problem, took off the top slice of bread and use knife and fork for the rest. Service was great. Meal prices included tax. Some items it includes tax and beverage. others included tax and side dish.  Very reasonable prices.  I will be returning to this establishment.  Oh and here I thought it was a new place. NO , they have been there for 17 yrs!!",

I can't speak to the food, as I was only there to drink and meet a few people, but I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere.  The service, unlike a few other reviews have stated, was pretty decent. I don't recall waiting an inordinant amount of time for another beer or a time where I felt like I was being ignored.  The interior seems a bit small, but it had a nice feel to it. There was a duo playing bluesy covers and a few jazz tunes, but the patio is the place for me.  Nice place to go if you have a group or just a few friends to catch up with.",

Unlike other late-night options, the menu is pretty extensive - from Thai chicken skewers to the artichoke, zucchini and portobello melt.   But I don't think I would ever go there if I had to sit inside. It's tiny, smoky and a little creepy to be honest.  The outside patio is totally different. You're surrounded by pretty trees and plants and feel as though you've stumbled upon some secret garden bar. And in some ways, you have. Sir Ed's is behind the Park Road Shopping Center and you take a strange journey down the back alley to get there.   It's a fun atmosphere and good for groups of friends. I've always had friendly servers, although it's not the speediest service.",

We were glad it still has that great pub atmosphere and that the menu still had our favorites. However, the items that used to be great we're just OK last night. The goat cheese fritters were very bland. I actually had to add salt to them. Without good seasoning, they lost their \"wow\" factor. The kids' grilled cheese was dry and bland and the fries soft.  The service, although friendly. was very slow last night. Two wait staff seemed to be covering the whole room.  We waited 20 minutes before anyone took our food order.  They have 2 menus: entrees and bar food which includes appetizers. The choices are good but too pricey to choose 2 appetizers  as your meal along with a salad. We may go again if we are in the area, but it will be for the beer and atmosphere, not for good food.",

I heard that they had reopened and some of the originals were back, so the wife and I tried them for lunch. First of all, the place looks pretty much the same. It seems like they may have painted and \"spruced up\" some but overall it still looks like an authentic British Pub. I heard they had some good vegetarian offerings and I wanted to check them out. It turns out that there aren't really that many vegetarian options, mainly the \"burger\" and the stuffed pepper. I went with the stuffed pepper and my wife got the much lauded fish and chips. The pepper was quite good with nice flavors, I would have liked more seasoning but that is just me. My only complaint, albeit minor, was that the quinoa on top was a little too crunchy. The fish and chips was another story. We expected something piping hot, extremely crisp and salty just waiting for some malt vinegar. While it was a nice piece of cod, the fry job was less than stellar, not as crisp as it should have been and nearly completely devoid of seasoning. A disappointment for sure. The service was somewhat hit and miss, our waitress vanished a couple of times and we had to seek her out to get the check. If you like the \"pub feel\" and just want a pint at the bar then this is your place. We will give them another chance but with all the competition for my dining dollar, they won't be back in the rotation anytime soon.",

Burgers are fine, but that's American food not proper British fare.  I was here a few years ago and maybe my standards are higher now. If you want drinks with a Scottish flag on the wall, here's Sir Edmond (aside from that it's served cold for Yanks and the taps aren't hand-pulls).

Anything with cheese is a splurge of course but this was quite flavor-filled above a typical GC ... I think on raisin sour dough bread?  Beyond the food .. the staff was very friendly and helpful.  Even lent me a hand (or as many as it took) as I hopped my way to the rest room.  It speaks of their serving heart to lend a hand even when its not their job to help me out.

It's just warm and inviting. Staff are attentive and provide great service. Just ask and they will provide.   Ordered the fish and chips- Delicious! Love the breading of the fish. Stayed afterwards for their 1/2 price on bottle of wine special.  Will be back again to get the salmon salad. That looked yummy.",

Not sure how the last two relate to friendship but go with me on this one.  Driving behind Park Road Shopping Center can be a little unsettling but like I told my dinner companions its worth the trip.  Try any of the specials or the always sensational grilled cheese, shepherds pie or any other of the pub-ish offerings. The TV's are large the crowd isn't too loud and its a foodie's take on pub food.",

Sit at the bar - the bartender (sound it out like \"Gare-Road\")  is a sweet as can be, quick service & knows everything about the place & menu.  Best Tip About this place: you have to know where to look to find it : )",

My food is indescribable without using excessive profanity: but here goes. I ordered the Reuben. It was plated nicely, huge visual appeal. First bite? Awful. Rubbery dog sh*t with half*ss corned beef flavor. Usually a small part of whatever meat is going to be gristle or rubbery or whatever but the rest is redeemable or great. So I tried two more bites which were equally awful. Then made my boyfriend (nicest guy ever) try a bite. He didn't say anything. I left the whole thing mangled on the plate. I want to say I'm disappointed in my food but 'disgusted' and 'outraged' fit way better. Suggestion for you guys- put the Reuben with the French dip: OFF THE MENU.  We will not return.",

    "text": "I actually have mixed feelings about reviewing this place, because it's probably one of my favorite places to hang out in Charlotte.  Located in Park Rd Shopping Center... it's very easy to miss since the place is located behind the shopping center.  The only indication you have that it is there from the front of the shopping center is a small sign in between Ski Country Sports and Rack Room Shoes.  There is parking in the back (if Sir Edmond's is your only destination) if you don't want to mess with all the shopping traffic.  Park Rd Shopping Center is undergoing a renovation to bring the place back to it's former glory... for the most part the changes are pretty nice, but the construction can be a pain.  Sir Edmond's has great atmosphere... once you find it... it feels like your own little secret.  It's got some great beers on tap (some local) but I always feel obligated to get a Guinness here (so good out of the tap!).  The food is excellent.  There is an eclectic choice of UK food... and some choices that don't seem very British... but it's great to have the option if you aren't feeling the fish and chips that evening/day.  Server's are super nice and the bar keep makes for good conversation.  Their patio is so great!  It is located in a busy shopping center, but it feels like its in its own little world.  One that I like to frequently visit as much as possible....",

    "text": "Well I Can Cross This Off My Bucket List!  A Charlotte native that has lived within 5 miles of this place for all of my life of 58 years l have always been intrigued by Sir Edmond Halley's brew pub.  Well I'm no longer intrigued, and I'm no longer chomping at the bit to hurry back.  My wife and I were looking for Midwood Smokehouse but it has yet to open, so I pulled into a parking space near the entrance and away we went.  Upon arrival it's like going into the basement of your house when the light bulbs are burned out.  Not very large but a decent sized bar greets you to your right, and a row of tables to your left, with a few in-between.  I'm hard pressed to describe as intimate.  We were seated on the left side row two tables down from a sleeping patron.  At this point I'm not sure if he is drunk and passed out or just tired, but our presence didn't awaken him.  The waitress was prompt and brought us a menu almost immediately.  I am the former representative of the old British company Lucas, and I told my spouse, look they have a Lucas refrigerator, because the water had no ice!  I decided on having a Ruben with a wedge salad and my wife had the fish and chips.  The Ruben was fine with fresh bread but was a little skimpy on the ingredients, and the wife's fish and chips was presentable with one large piece of Code and ample fries.  The fish was a little greasy and my wife was a little disappointed, so we switched plates after each ate about half.  The meal for both of us, valued in today's market should have been about $20, but addressing this establishment as Sir, extracts a $7.50 premium.  I can get a better Ruben from Jason's Deli for about the same price, but the Fish and Chips can be obtained from Captain D'S for over 50% less.  Someone has described the personally of the waitress as like seaweed, which is a little harsh but not too far from the truth.    Granted I'm not coming here to drink so after a few pints of Stout beer, I'm sure my review would be more complimentary, but sober it is what it is! Enter at your own risk!",

That was okay with me. I thought they will compensate by giving me a decent amount of the two ingredients left (portobello and sauerkraut)... nope. I couldn't even tell there was sauerkraut on it and there was a one sliver of portobello, legit. My boyfriend and his friend (who ordered dishes with meat) had a sufficient meal. I don't get the disconnect. I can't believe they weren't ashamed bringing that out to me.  This place was a go to, now it's gonna be a big no to. Sorry... if a restaurant doesn't respect that I'm spending my hard earned money on their food then they don't deserve my money.",

I got to sample the Chicken Fingers which looked to be hand breaded there.  Then I got a order of the Cod fish tacos.   The blackened seasoning was really good, but if you order it get it with a side of sweet potato fries.  It really compliments it.",

    "text": "I must say it was a big dissapointment.   Little bit of background before I start my review- my mom is from England, my family owned a British Pub (in the states) till I was a teenager, and the last time I had bangers and mash was in England.  Driving up to it is a little weird, the entrance is in the back of all the buildings.  Atmosphere- it was a little dark abut had a cute little pub vibe.  Staff- very friendly, but for it being pretty empty on a Thursday night waiting 10 mins to refill out drafts was a little much.  Food- Started with pan seared goat cheese fritters which were pretty good but I believe the pan needed to be cleaned. The best way I can describe it was that the outside had a pancakey taste. We also got the Irish potato pancakes which were the best thing we ate all night. I ordered the bangers and mash for my main course. They had it down as a plate to share? It just seems odd to me. It came with a side of peas (just as Mom would have served it). I wanted to like it but something was off. There was a curry type flavor to the gravy which did not pair well with the bangers which were just not what I was used to. My friend got the Shepards pie which was not the shepherds pie I am used to. Who knows my mom might just be a terrible cook. This was like stew with a thin layer of extra crispy mashed potatoes on top. The way to describe the taste was scortched. The stew like base just had this burnt taste to it. Mom always has a heap of mashed potatoes in hers so it never gets to where it's more of a crouton than a mashed potato....  Needless to say we skipped dessert.... I couldn't dare run the chance of them ruining apple pie for me!  I'm hoping it was just a bad night in the kitchen. My friend had been there a few times before and said the place is hit or miss, based on the reviews I'd say that's right.",

Walked in wanting to try some goodness, so excited from the pictures. As soon as you walk in, it's darkly lite, and has a hole in the wall bar like feeling about it. I was going to sit down, but the smell of the place was dingy, and something I still can't put my finger on. This kept me from continuing past the lady that was vacuuming the floor and said I could have a seat anywhere.

Maybe 2 stars. Next we had fish and chips which I'd rate about 3 stars (but was very greasy). Lemon chicken, if there was a pleasant surprise this was it. For desert we ended with their apple pie which had far to much cinnamon in it...about all we could taste. Price seemed fair and they have a great selection of beer.",

They have an extensive outside patio that is secluded from the rest of the shopping center, and was beautiful on a warm fall day. And it's quiet from the rest of the hustle of the shopping center.   Food menu was typical pub fare. We had the edamame for an appetizer and there was a generous amount of that. For lunch, my fiance had their cheeseburger and noted that the burger was cooked to a perfect medium, but his mashed potatoes were just average. I had the blackened fish tacos, and they were good, and the blackening spice was spicy. I just wish there was another dimension of flavor besides the spice of the fish. Again, everything was good, but nothing \"mindblowing\".   Service was sub par, had to ask a few times for my beverage and the server forgot to bring back my credit card to sign, I had to remind her. But looking positively, you certainly aren't rushed here so you can enjoy our beautiful Charlotte weather!",

    "text": "I have been here a few times over the years and have always enjoyed the food. However, I went here for St. Patty's Day this past weekend to grab some food and celebrate the holiday and our experience was horrible. Upon sitting down, my boyfriend ordered a coffee along with our other beverages. When it came out, it tasted like black tea & we asked the waitress about it. She claimed \"It's St. Patrick's day, weirder things have happened\" and then left. She came back saying that they put tea in the coffee filter. Again blaming it being St. Patrick's Day. We thought it was weird but continued with our order. We ordered the Irish egg rolls (which were good). The rest of our order was BAD. The bangers and mash came out cold (peas were still frozen!). When we told the waitress about it -- she took it back to the kitchen and apologized saying \"Sorry, it's not normally like this, but  it's St Patrick's Day\"....When she brought it back out it was the same dish we had already eaten off of, just microwaved! Definitely not sanitary...The last thing ordered was the \"curry\" fries. Which literally came out as a side of fries with some runny curry soup in a tiny cup -- not exactly what I would expect curry fries to be. We ended up spending $40 on this meal plus tip, and was definitely not worth the price. I also just don't understand why it being St Patrick's Day is an excuse. I feel like this is the time for an Irish Pub to shine, not have one problem after the other.",

    "text": "Found this place by accident with my friends when we were trying to hunt down the speakeasy behind Park Road shopping center. We stopped in for a drink and decided to sit on the patio. The patio was super cute at night- music playing, Christmas lights in the trees and an array of different customers.   Inside of Sir Edmonds is a True Irish Bar. From to the decor to even the smell it reminded me of a little pub in London. The bartenders were nice and made sure to greet us upon entering the pub.   I didn't try any food, but I would love to try it out and enjoy the patio. The inside was a little too muggy for me, but the patio area is nice and open with plenty of seating!",

I stopped in to continue my reuben adventure around Charlotte, and I was quite pleased I found this spot. The corned beef on this reuben was one of the best I've found around Charlotte, full of flavor and freshly carved for the sandwich - definitely in the top 3 of all the corned beef I've had on the 25+ reubens around the city. The kraut had the tartness required in a reuben, and it was finished out with a generous portion of cheese and russian. The biggest miss came with their one deviation from the standard reuben - using sourdough instead of rye. Overall it was a delicious reuben and one I plan to have again.",

I would say that that part is True.   I ordered the stuffed zucchini and was not very impressed. The sauce was a marinara, but it was watery in texture, and very salty. I also couldn't really tell if the zucchini was stuffed with anything else of substance. I feel like they halved the zucchini, cut the seeds out, cooked it, and poured sauce over it. Even my college roommate had more talent than that.  On the other hand, my mom ordered the Quinoa, Spinach & Roasted Vegetables, which she let me try and I thought was pretty decent. It still wasn't overly impressive, but it looked like more effort had been put into the creation of the dish than mine.   The service was fine... nothing to rave about, but not terrible either.   I feel like this place is going to be hit or miss depending on what you order and when you go, which is reflected in their mixed reviews. Not sure I would bother to go again honestly.",

    "text": "Sir Ed's is a Charlotte institution that still is an unknown to a lot of people.  Hidden in the back of Park Road Shopping Center, it can be hard to find - but, that should be changing as the back area is expanding to accommodate Amelie's and Midwood Smokehouse.    If the weather is nice, you can enjoy the patio that is surrounded by trees and plants with lights strung in the trees to create a festive atmosphere.  Inside, Sir Ed's looks like your traditional irish pub - dimly lit with dark wood.    Their beer selection is not huge, but always includes a cider on tap and guiness.  They also have a larger than most selection of wines by the glass - though you won't find any deals here with glasses starting at $7.50.     The menu is where Sir Ed's really shines.  They have a nice selection of appetizers, sandwiches and entrees.  A couple that really stand out - the jerk chicken quesadilla appetizer (i know, not irish) is one of my favorite options, the wedge salad is also quite good.  I also like their fish and chips, fries with curry sauce, asparagus and portabello grilled cheese, and tomato soup.  The only dish I consistently don't care for is their curry chicken - it's just a bit watery and bland.    Sir Ed's offers a free birthday dinner the week of your birthday - visit their website to sign up for this great offer.    Every Monday is trivia night - beware, this is not a pop culture trivia night!  There are seven rounds of questions - each round has a theme.  There's always one music round and one picture round - leaving 5 more rounds to challenge you and your teammates.",

The indoor section of the bar is dark and divey and on my last visit the AC was on full blast which made me wish I had brought a sweater out on a day where the outside temperature was well into the 80s.   I have tried several of their menu items. My favorite meal was the seared tuna salad. I had this delicious dish one afternoon out on the patio while my dog hung out with me. The waitress was kind enough to bring him a water bowl! On a more adventurous visit I tried the ostrich meatloaf, which wasn't really my thing but I had not tried ostrich before.   On the last visit we ordered the buffalo shrimp. I had meant to get the buffalo cauliflower because of the rave reviews but when I saw it was only a dollar more to have shrimp I changed my mind. Maybe I should have stuck with the vegetables since the shrimp were tiny and a large portion of the already small shrimp was the batter. The flavor was good but the portion seemed small for the price.  For the entree I decided to pretend like I eat healthy and ordered the stuffed zucchini (with goat cheese fritters and a vegetable ragu). The sauce and the zucchini was delicious but the fritters were cold and unappealing. I gave them both away after I had a bite. You don't want to give away food when you paid $13 for a vegetarian dish.   The beer selection is pretty good (they have fortnight on tap!) but I don't think they carry oranges for Blue Moon. I have ordered it twice there and each time no orange slice for me even after I asked for one which is a shame because I love snacks with my drinks.",

Thr batter is so light and crunchy. I loved every bit of it. I didn't even think to ask for some malt vinegar until i was about done. I loved their thick cut potatoes too. Quite hearty and substantial. Very satisfying for the $10 price tag.  If I can ever find it again I will definitely be back.

It is easy to miss at first since it's located behind the shopping center. Just follow the little sign and down a flight of stairs until you reach a Tudor-style front entrance that transports you to what I would imagine an English or Irish pub looks like. The ceilings are a little low but it adds to the charm and intimacy of the place. Our server was really great and funny. They have Guinness on tap! The menu had a lot of options perfect for sharing with a group. My brother and I just split two appetizers but the portions were big enough to pass around the table to share. The Flash Fried Zucchini was excellent - crispy and nicely seasoned. The Goat Cheese Fritters were my brother's pick. I didn't really care for the Cabernet sauce. I really wish I tried one of the entrees like the  Classic English Fish and Chips but all the more reason to come back. Only complaint was there is only one unisex bathroom, at least in the front that I saw, but would you expect more from a classic pub?",

The wife had the Wahoo catch of the day, it was a very well prepared but a little too much seasoning buried the flavor of the fish but not to the point you could not enjoy it.  The Garlic hummus was wonderful and Pita, Carrots and Cucumber were fresh.  We will go back but I can tell you as it got closer to 6pm it picked up considerably, business wise.  So it appears to be popular.  GIve it a shot.  PS Half Price bottle of Wines on Weds.",

The fish and chips are the best in Charlotte and some of the best I have ever eaten. Other dishes that I recommend are the jerk nachos, the ostrich meatloaf, the blackened wings, the goat cheese fritters, the Jamaican jerk quesadilla, the Pan Seared Lemon Chicken and the Curry Chicken (yellow curry). They have fantastic burgers as well! As you can see there are many great dishes to choose from.  They have a decent selection of imported and craft beer that they serve in British pint (20 oz)  glasses. They pour a mean pint of Guinness (one of the best in town!). They are one of the only places you can get a pint of Old Speckled Hen (an English bitter style beer from the UK). They serve a selection of local craft beers that rotate. They have a good wine list and a full bar as well.   The place can be a little hard to find as it is on the backside of Park Road shopping Center. There is an entrance from the front of the shopping center near Brownlee jewelers. They have outdoor seating which is quite nice when the weather cooperates! This hidden gem is a great place to grab a pint, a bite to eat and talk.",

    "text": "This used to be my son's favorite pub but I think the closed and reopened.  When I say that, we're going back probably 10 to 15 years ago and this used to be one of his favorite places.  He's moved to Atlanta but always wanted to give it a try and even tried to find it several in the Park Road Shopping Center.    Believe me, it's well hidden.  On a recent trip to the Flying Biscuit Cafe, I saw the sign that pointed the way but did not find the restaurant itself.  My wife is flying back from Pittsburgh and flight has already been delayed twice. By the time I pick her up, it's almost 8 pm and it started to rain.  Got on Billy Graham Pkwy which becomes Woodlawn and were there in less that 15 minutes and then time to complete the exploration.  Walked behind the wall, down the corridor, down two flights or stairs and low and behold we were there.  Now that I know where it's at and the landmarks, it's easier to get to from the back parking lot.  Walked in and promptly seated.  That said, only one server it the entire restaurant and granted not overflowing, service was a bit slow because she had to attend to other patrons.  Typical British Pub atmosphere with a strong emphasis on British Ales, Largers and Stouts and Soccer and all things English or Welsh.  Looking over the menu, it had a number of favorites like Fish and Chips, Shepard's Pie, my wife's favorite Banger and Mash but in the end, we went another direction.  My wife went with a Wedge Salad and French Onion Soup but somehow could not communicate to the server that she wanted the French Onion Soup on the daily special. She ended up pointing the item to the server.  I am a little more daring.  On the menu was Ostrich Meatloaf. I've had Ostrich before at a small restaurant on East Independence Blvd Dik-a-Dee's (sp?) long since gone and my impression of Ostrich was Dry and rather tough Turkey.  Wanted to see if it was the same.  Still tastes somewhat like Turkey but cooked down in a Meatloaf, it's got a much tender texture and is actually very good.  Even though it's good, not sure I would order again because of the premium price for something with equal taste and texture you can get with ground turkey for a lower cost.  Nice atmosphere but again even though it was slow, management needs to look at the staffing requirements because while she was trying, the server could not provide adequate service to the main dining room and the side one as well",

    "text": "Nice little pub atmosphere tucked in the back of the Park Rd Shopping Mall. Went here for a group lunch. Tip, drive off park rd, towards the back entry, you get a better chance of parking there than in the main parking lot area. Plus you don't have to go down the stairs.  For lunch I had the Shepard's Pie. Ground lamb with peas and carrots topped with a potato pancake like crust. I love shepard's pie, this one was  a little meh. It lacked on flavor to be honest. The potato pancake was the highlight, if even. We were a party of 4, 3 of us got the shepard's pie and one of us got the Cuban. They use yellow mustard on it. I do prefer stone ground. Maybe I'll try their fish and chips next time. That is another \"irish pub\" staple any so called irish pub should master.  Atmosphere: nice cozy wooden booths and tables. A pub style bar with high chairs and a private room. You are on the lower level of the Shopping mall, so only high windows available. Ceiling is not quite low, but cozy. It's traditional Irish I suppose, you can catch someone entering wearing quilts. I wonder how packed this place is during St. Paddy's.  Service was great and servers were attentive. Never had to ask for a refill or the check.",

The reason for the lower rating is because if you're calling yourself an Irish pub, at least look like an Irish pub, and don't put one item on the menu that makes it appear like an Irish pub --rant over.  Aside from that, the place felt a bit grimy.  It's nestled between CO and another spot down an ally which is cool.  This place totally has the potential to be awesome!  Make it look like an Irish pub, add Scotch egg's, sausage rolls, full English breakfast, and others to the menu, and we'd have five stars.",

We had a cozy area in the back which was good since we can get a bit noisy.  They have plenty of beers, ciders and wine and the food has a bit of an English twist. Think British pub.   I ordered the Hong Kong egg rolls for an app and the turkey burger for dinner. The egg rolls were okay and a good portion. Tasted more like Asian stir-fried veggies in an egg roll. Came with a spicy sauce and a soy sauce. This turkey burger is my favorite. The bun is soft but toasted. The burger itself has great seasoning. It's topped with arugula, goat cheese and apple, which is always a winning combination.   Service can be slow at times, but remember it's a pub and not fine dining. But I enjoy coming here.",

The jerk chicken had a really unique blast of flavors that was delicious.    We were full after these two shareables but we want to come back to enjoy the patio and try the fish and chips.

The food was great, but the portions were a bit smaller than most other similar style restaurants in the area.  I was a bit disappointed with the shepherd's pie.  It looks great, but the bowl is very shallow and the meat was ground and just didn't retain any sort of lamb taste or texture.    We loved the service and the location is easy to get to.  They have a nice outside seating area during nicer weather with lots of room for special occasions and live music.    All in all, this place is decent if you have a hankering for some beer and fish-n-chips.",

They're like that old elementary school buddy you might go years without seeing but as soon as you're hanging out in the same place at the same time, it's like no time at all has passed. On our most recent visit, the first in a year, at least, I didn't even pick up the menu. Intuitively, I ordered without hesitation, \"Jerk chicken nachos, please!\" I mean, it's a no brainer. I've been eating those nachos as a late night treat for almost 15-years.   I was living abroad when they closed temporarily. I almost bought airfare home for one last order of those nachos. Thankfully, some saint decided to revive ol' Sir Ed's not long after they closed and the late night shenanigans live on!   Does the place have it's faults? Certainly. But, who doesn't? On those nights I'm not feeling their beer selection, I go with a proseccco. If it's too loud and somehow kinda smokey inside (even though you haven't been able to smoke inside restaurants in NC for years) I'll just hang out on the patio. Slow service? No big deal. More time to hang out with the table of friends sure to be along for the evening.   I may see you next weekend or next year, Sir Ed's. Regardless, I know we'll hit it off as if we just saw each other the day before. No menu needed thankyouverymuch.",

The restaurant was full but we were able to get the last table.  I over heard a server had called in sick and the servers that were working were running around like crazy.  I heard this from the manager / owner that was casually sitting with some friends at the table next to us.  Instead of getting up and helping his staff, he mingled with his friends the entire time we were there.    Throughout the dinner we had three different servers stop by all of which had not communicated about our order, etc.  I can understand and tolerate this as they were all trying -but  I continued to be annoyed by the manager / owner just sitting by watching.    We ordered a wedge salad and added blue cheese crumbles and a side of ranch and a fish fry to share between the two of us.  My boyfriend ordered a Stella and I ordered a vodka soda with a splash of cranberry.    The food and drinks were good.  My dissappoinment came when we received the bill (after waiting for it for 10 minutes).   We were charged $1.50 for blue cheese crumbles (and not told it would be an extra charge), $.50 for the side of ranch for the salad and $.50 for the \"splash\" of cranberry that was probably a tablespoon worth.  If the original menu items were cheap - I wouldn't have minded but I thought the prices were a bit extreme for the actual food that we received.    It's unlikely I will return.",

    "text": "I went there today to celebrate St. Patrick's Day at lunchtime.   I was surprised to see a few items on their menu that seemed more Asian than Irish, but what the hey.  I choose the Rueben Sandwich--sounded like a safe bet.  What a disappointment--two undertoasted pieces of white bread with one piece of corned beef between and a spoonful of sauerkraut on top.  I was still hungry after I forked out 10 bucks for this appetizer sized lunch.   I would have thought that since they would be drawing folks in that perhaps hadn't eaten there before (I have several times over the years) that they would want to put their best foot forward to garner some repeat business.  Based on what I saw, they favor quantity served vs. quality of food.  I will not be going back anytime soon.",

An english style pub with an awesome selection of beer. The inside is dank and dark ( for some reason i kinda like it). The outside patio is awesome to sit on a nice day and have some grub.  They were out of th eostrich  lasagna so I opted for the new york strip.  I ordered it Medium Rare and it came out Rare.  That is completely fine with me, but might put off some people.  It came with some sort of potato cake that was just awesome.  The only problem I had was the strip I had was not the best cut of beef.  I guess though for $18 i really shouldn't complain especially about the size. I will be back at this little gem in clt",

Now when I come back to Charlotte the trip isn't complete without a plate of Jamaican Jerk Chicken nachos and a beer.   Sir Ed's has some of the best bar/pub food  you'll find.

It has the best of many worlds, go early enough, it is a great Restaurant with a \"different\" menu than what you would expect (You have to try the Ostrich Meatloaf!).   Go a little later in the evening, it is the classic \"pub\". I enjoy them both.   I have been to restaurants and pubs all over Europe and the USA.  Sir Ed's ranks right up there with the best of them.  It is a great place to go for a celebration or just to grab a beer in the evening.   Draft selection is great, a True bonus if you like English beer! (and Guinness!) I have always found the staff to be outstanding..Over the years, they have had a couple that were not up to the task but thankfully they did not last.   Bar Staff is always wonderful and accommodating and over the years have become friends. Great place to go!!!",

They have a good selection of beers, once almost exclusively British beers, but they've started to get a lot of good local craft brews, too. The beer is always cold and perfectly poured, and a pretty good value, too (most beers are 20 oz. pints for $5, unlike the 14 oz. \"pints\" you get in a lot of other places). The staff are also top-notch. Jefferson, Mattie and Bradley will always make sure you never have to wait too long to get another beer! They have an Internet jukebox with a good selection of tunes (surprisingly, many Internet jukeboxes have a crappy selection). But my favorite aspect: it's a PUB. It looks like a pub inside, with seemingly ancient posters for London Underground and McEwan's inside. I love it!",

    "text": "Went for lunch on a Thursday.  Place is located on the back lower level of the Park Road Shopping Center.  Felt like it was in a basement.  Not my cup of tea.  Ordered the classic Fish and Chips - it is supposed to be an English pub.  Was very disappointed that the crust on my fish was soggy - yuck!  Other menu items included pretty standard burgers and sandwiches along with some more exotic selections like ostrich meatloaf.  Desserts were almost non-existent - I tried the chocolate and peanut butter tarte - couldn't taste any peanut butter in it.  Skip dessert here.  Although one of my companions tried the chocolate pudding served to resemble a Guinness in a glass.  No one at our table ordered beer and we didn't get a beverage menu so I can't really comment on the beer and wine selection.  The food menu was interesting in that all items on it were priced at $8 each - would make it really easy to split a check if there with a group!  Patio seating looked very nice - wished we'd taken advantage of it!  The place gets an extra star from me because they appear to be very dog-friendly.  One patron had her furry friend with her on the patio (he was very well behaved and laid quietly at her feet) and someone had provided a large bowl of water for him.  Location could be difficult for someone with mobility problems - difficulty walking or in a wheelchair.  Seems like there are lots of elevation changes and an uneven floor in many spots.  Won't cringe if someone suggests it again - but won't rush to go back either.",

    "text": "Reading the other reviews, It seems to that the key to enjoying Sir Ed's is NOT to order the Fish n Chips. The fantastic beer selection is one reason to keep coming back.  I had trouble deciding, and finally just closed my eyes and pointed to the page. The waitress was very good at asking for refills.  We ate outside on the patio, which has a great atmosphere, and despite being busy, was very intimate and quiet. We went with another couple, both of whom had the Fish n Chips.  They both enjoyed them, and I think both are experienced Fish n Chippers, so that says a lot, especially since they are also \"foodies\".     We started the table with french fries with the curry dipping sauce, which is REALLY delicious!!  So delicious, in fact, that my husband nearly bit our waitresses hand off when she tried to take it before he had scraped it all out!    My husband had the shaved leg of lamb wrap.  He raved about it, oohing and aahing through the whole meal.  As a fan of lamb in general, I am sure I would have loved it too, had be bothered to share a bite with me!    I had the Roasted Artichoke, Zucchini & Garlic sandwich.  It was also really fantastic. The bread was still crispy, even with the roasted veggies on it soaking the bread with deliciousness!  There's not too much more to say about it--it was just a good sandwich that definitely satisfied this customer.   I am definitely interested in trying the Ostrich meatloaf and kangaroo loin--how cool does that sound??  They have a very eclectic menu, while still retaining a \"pub feel\".    I would definitely recommend sitting outside if it's nice, since the inside is a bit dingy and dark--not really my cup of tea.  We will definitely be coming back here, even if it is just to enjoy a pint outside with friends.",

    "text": "I don't give 1-star often, but I think this \"staple\" has earned it with the \"winning\" combo of overpriced food & beer, lack of menu options, and non-existent service. I came here on Friday to join a few friends after work for drinks and for the free personalized Guinness pint glass offer. The bartender turned out to be also the waiter for us in the back dining room, which means we seldomly saw him. He wasn't exactly friendly, but I guess he got the job done at the minimum since he did bring us our beer and put in our food order and checked on us every now and then... but was a smile that hard to come by? Do I really have to be a regular to get any friendly service? Worst was the food runner... which we didn't know that's her only job there (not like they have waitstaff uniforms on for us to distinguish). So when a late comer asked her to take his beer order, she snapped back \"I am not your waiter!\"  WELL, thank goodness she wasn't our waiter with that attitude. More interestingly, this very same food runner had to deliver a dish to the corner table next to ours that was blocked in by 2 big tables (ours and another one). Instead of doing her job the right way and walk around the both big tables to get to the corner table, she just pretty much demanded my friend to get up & push in the chair, so she could squeeze by... how lazy and unprofessional was that?! That pretty much set the tone for an unpleasant night for me.  To add salt in a wound, besides Guinness that was on special at the bargain price of $4, Fat Tire was $5... I didn't think Fat Tire is that caliber of a beer. Food was pricey as well, $4 for a basket of fries but with curry sauce (which would be the only reason I order fries/chips in an English pub) is $5, $14 for fish & chips and that didn't look like a huge order. They had more wings options than anything thing else... but if I want wings I probably would have gone to somewhere else. I ended up with $8.50 of blacken fish tacos. It was ok, the fish still had lots of liquid after being cooked, which didn't mix well with the slaw and tortilla wrap. I did enjoy the cup of soup as my side.   In short, I echo the other reviewer: I'll go to Big Ben any day over this joint if I am feeling a British pub mode. At least they have better menu options, and most certainly better service.",

    "text": "Been there before and enjoyed it.  However, before it changed management/ owner I used to get the fish and chips..... NEVER AGAIN!  The fish came out as a tube of bread with a tiny center of fish inside.  The ratio was about 70% bread (sweet tasting, too?!?) to about 30% WET white fish.  I ate one and1/2 bites and would have been sick if I ate the rest.  Fries were ok, but that's not what I get fish and chips for....  Lunch partner had BLT that had about a cup of mayo on it, so ask for it on the side.  Her tomato soup (used to be her favorite in CLT) was salty and not a lot of  tomato flavor.    I've had good stuff there, but not great.  I'll suggest to the new owners to buy the recipes from the old/previous owners....   I was surprised that the waitress asked me if I wanted a box for the 'fish' and got a resounding NO.  She could see I only ate about a bite or two.... but didn't ask if there was a problem.  Anyway, if I go back, I'm not sure what to order.    Another lunch partner had a mixed green salad with salmon on it.... he loved it.  Not my kind of lunch though.",

    "text": "Good gosh this place is hard to find! It's literally tucked away in the back of the shopping center! I don't even know how people would find this place without yelp and a gps.  The decor is quite classic English pub style and the service is charming. Sadly I find the food here a bit lacking after having been here twice. The first time I had the fish and chips which were good if a bit boring. The fries weren't as crisp as I would like and under seasoned. The fish batter on the other hand was delightfully crispy but also lacking some flavor. Salt is your friend! My second time here I had the Guinness stew, maybe my palate is not very good but it just tasted like canned beef stew to me. The best part of the dish were the vegetables on top of it. On the plus side drinks are cheap, and the patrons are friendly.",

The menu was really eclectic, and there were plenty of vegetarian options.  Enjoyed the random music - Coolio, Journey, Beatles.  Service was friendly. Try the Guineas pudding.  It's the richest chocolate pudding ever.  It comes in a mini Guinness glass, and even 6 of us couldn't finish it.",

    "text": "This random hole in the wall is located in the Park Rd. shopping center.  I had never heard of it until that fateful St. Patricks day when another beer was in order.  After making my way there and enjoying the patio, I decided the food was my next venture.  After my second, alcohol only, visit, I was excited to taste what vegetarian options they had.  I had the grilled cheese with spicy asparagus and portobello.  Let me tell you...grilled cheese is amazing, add a few interesting touches, it becomes addicting.  I was very happy with my sandwich.  Also, they have a very tasty appetizer of Goat Cheese Fritters with a red wine sauce.  Goat Cheese is one of my favorites and frying anything makes it better. I was in love.   Ther service is great and they can accomadate large groups, the few times I've been has been with 7-20 people.  Great staff, awesome menu choices, I'll be going back",

    "text": "I am happy to report that Sir Edmond's is back in business!  This is, quite literally, an out-the-way place.  You can access it from the front of the Park Road shopping center by a passageway, but if you have any mobility issues, you are better served by driving around the shopping center to the main entrance at the back.  In doing so, you'll discover a neat little area with an interesting secondhand shop and a charming outdoor garden shop.  Once you finally find the place, you'll discover that the inside suits its location.  You certainly get the feeling of eating in some tucked-away local nook.  Of course, the truly important thing about a restaurant is its food, and while part of the appeal of Sir Edmond's is surely it's location, it's food does not disappoint.  It's fairly typical pub far with a classy twist.  The shepherd's pie is delicious, and if you're feeling adventurous, try the ostrich meatloaf.  Unfortunately, the lamb sandwich they had before their temporary closure is nowhere to be found.  The portions seem smallish, but they are filling.  In short, I recommend Sir Edmund Halley's!",

    "text": "After a failed attempt one Sunday afternoon for lunch (don't open until like 5 on Sunday), we finally made it to Sir Edmond Halley's. It is tucked down below the Park Road shopping complex and can be accessed via that street as well.   For lunch, they have a two tier pricing system. A group of lunches for $8 that includes a drink and tax or a selection for $10 including drink and taxes. That works for me. i went for the ostrich meatloaf that came with veggies and mashed potatoes. It was good, not great, it was almost a little bland for my taste. However, i am a fan of what my wife ordered off the $8 list. The Broccoli Parmesan was terrific. Based on the server's recommendation, she got the tomato soup with it and it was a terrific combo. Dip that baby in the tomato soup and enjoy.   i did not consume any beers at this meal, but they had a few i would've liked to enjoy. Sadly, the drink included with lunch is not a Guinness, i double checked.",

    "text": "Unfortunately this gem shut down for a few months.  Fortunately it reopened without changing too much.  First off this place wins the award for creative location.  If you cannot find it locate the walking bridge connecting the strip mall to some cold war era looking apartment building in the rear, take the steps down and enter.  To me, this is the definition of pub.  Low lighting, dark wood, and real English pints.  The beer selection is perfect.  My meal of choice here: Goat cheese fritters to start followed by  Fish & Chips, although since I've cut out a lot of carbs I usually will substitute collard greens for the chips (amazing, but only available while supplies last).  I'll choose to wash it down with an Old Speckled Hen or four.  Perfect place to come on a Friday to start forgetting about your week and take it slow.  Not into seafood?  No worries, literally everything on the menu is phenomenal, but when in a pub, I'm sticking with pub fare, so my runner-ups are ostrich meatloaf or a good old fashioned bacon cheese burger.  It is a must try.",
