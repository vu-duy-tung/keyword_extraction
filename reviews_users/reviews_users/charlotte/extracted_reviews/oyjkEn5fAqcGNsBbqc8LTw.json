When we got the fries we did not get any forks and i had to wait for ten minutes for them to bring some. Hen we waited 40 min for the wings to arrive and when they did they were cold. I asked to talk to the manager and it took another 20 min for the manager to show up and all he said was IM SORRY. This location is a total disaster i should have checked the reviews here before we came!!",

And I would say that I have had good service twice. The hostesses are great and bartenders but the waitresses we have had suck. This might not pertain to everyone but the ones that suck, you know who you are. We get food late, beers sit at the bar waiting for waitresses to go pick them up until I have to ask them to go get it. Also, when they finally show up, their excuse is \"sorry I was talking in the back and forgot\". I have given this place a ton of chances and I can guarantee we aren't coming back again. Stay away from this one. Other ones I am sure are better!!",

I received only half of my order because of which after reaching home I had to order some more food as the incomplete order we got was not enough. The person on phone told us come any day and get the order back. I called up today to get the order and the way manager talked was as if I am asking for a favor, i just told it was your fault and it was your teams commitment to give me the same order back, however insted of honoring the word given by the team he made me feel as if I am asking a favor for more food which I was not hence i told thanks to him and did not order anything.... is this what you call service that because of your fault your customer should bear the cost..... Worst experience.!!!!!",

When she finally made it to us, she was quick to tell us we really weren't on of her tables but she was picking it up. That was evident the whole time. Our drinks came slow and were never refilled.  Our food took forever and when it finally came my order was 75% wrong.  The manager finally stopped by and refilled our drinks. When she back with the corrected plate, she did apologize and say she was going to take care of that entree on the check.....that was great except when the check came, IT WAS ON THERE. The service was so bad that when the waitress brought the check, which was also wrong, she said, \"oh if you are paying cash you don't need to worry about a tip at all.\" No kidding.   On a positive note, the food was good, especially the fried cheese curds.",

Whatever, no big, just another unsatisfactory restaurant experience that would go without a review or comment from me. But then it was time to pay, and the waitress DIDN'T BRING MY CREDIT CARD BACK. I tried to get her attention multiple times but she ignored us, along with every other server around. I decided to walk up to the counter to find the manager myself, and happened to glance to my left at the waitress station where the computer was.... And saw my credit card sitting out in the open where anyone could take it, completely unattended. I was LIVID. I looked around for a server or manager or someone to talk to about it but there was absolutely no one to be found. I will be checking my credit card statements quite frequently for the foreseeable future. Buffalo Wild Wings in Rivergate, the poor service was one thing but the complete disregard for people's credit cards and financial security and privacy is absolutely unacceptable.",

The server asked if everything was ok and when I told her about the kids meal she took it back and it was delivered by a different server with no apology. The pepper steak wrap hardly had any steak and was tasteless but that didn't stop them from charging almost $10.00 for it. My daughter walked out starving and I walked out disappointed and angry.

Here's how:  I was minding my own business, walking out of the Charlotte Ear Eyes Nose & Throat where I was shadowing an audiologist, and BOOM! I see a giant buffalo-man walking around Rivergate. I approach him, give him a high-five, and find out that the Buffalo Wild Wings down the way is going to open on Monday, but that they are offering FREE FOOD for people that dine in today for lunch.   Victory. I called up a buddy and we got into lunch-mode. We shared the fried roasted garlic mushrooms, which were delicious. I ordered twelve traditional wings, split between the asian zing and traditional buffalo sauces. I preferred the later, which was rich and buttery, while the asian zing was a bit too sweet for my palette. My buddy ordered the steak stack sandwich, which featured strips of steak topped on  with pepper jack cheese, onion rings, and spicy garlic BWW sauce. He devoured it.   The BEST part is most definitely the tab: $0.00! We left our server a generous tip, of course, but it was nonetheless an epic dining experience. Will definitely be back for opening day!",

It blows my mind because they can't possibly know alcohol laws if they don't know anything about the menu - going to bite that company one day.  I am not sure but I think someone I know told me they do the shared tip thing and I thought maybe that may be why but I know another place that does that and the service is excellent.  I don't know what the problem is - I have worked in the industry before while in college and I would say front of the house training needs big overhaul.  At any rate, they have lots of TV's and it is closer to us but just plain not good.  I wish they would switch locations with Wild Wing Cafe - also chain-y but much better food and service.",

    "text": "So, it's been a while since I've yelped....due to the busy hectic life I have, but it took this night to bring back my passion for Yelping.    It was a Wednesday night, not unlike any other night, but I was craving some wings....not just any wings. I wanted some good looking wings, just like the commercials, and wanted to have the opportunity to try some good tasty menu items that are featured on the website.  Off to wild wings in Steele Creek.....This is relatively new, appears clean and fresh from the outside and it features a nice large covered patio area with some tv's with ample seating.  But this mind you is where the good stuff ends, and the adventure begins.   It took a few minutes for the hostess to locate a table for us, there were 2 clean tables and six ( yes 6 ) dirty tables that were never bussed or cleaned in the main area toward the entrance or front door.  I mention six tables as they were the same six tables that were never cleaned prior to our departure.  The service was slow, the atmosphere or environment could have been nice, but regardless where you are .....if you are sitting next to trash and dirty tables, then you may as well be eating next to a landfill, this place was a dive.  Trash on the floor, filthy tables, and did I mention the dirty tables, Geez, the UFC was on, the football game was on, and all I could see was the trash!  So we ordered drinks and an Appetizer, the hostess was the food runner, and brought the mushrooms after 10 minutes or so.... The wings, well we were going to eat them there, however with all the trash, we chose to have our meals boxed to go since we could not stand the trash.  As I recall, there were no silverware for us to use , and the mushrooms came out in a cardboard type box, so why can't the servers just throw the trash away?   Will I be back, Don't Think so!  Just thought this location needs a boot in the buttocks, as if management noticed this and allowed this location to look like that, then it won't take long before it will become like the Buffalo, Nearing Extinction.  Very Frustrated....should spend less money on advertising and more money on training servers and management.",

I was looking to sit down and have a beer while I placed a TO GO order for Wing Tuesday. Upon arrival there was no one in the restaurant to be seen so I sat at the bar and waited. I looked at the clock and saw it was now 12:40 and I decided to get up and start looking for some sign of life so I went to the to go area and saw all of the employees huddled up in the back of house on their phones laughing so I asked if I could have a beer and place a to go order and the manager said no. I asked why and he said they stop serving alcohol at 1230 every night and it was company policy. I had explained how I had just got off work and drove 20 minutes to get to that location and he Said there's nothing that could be done. I'm a Buffalo Wild Wings rewards member and it is my favorite place to eat but I will not be visiting this location again. What a waste of time.",

I would not have chose to come here but my wife and son wanted to come here. I must admit I have a slight grudge against this location for an incident that happened awhile back. My daughter came here to eat with friends and received very poor service from whoever was waiting on them and she decided not to leave a tip. Come to find out when she got her bank statement the waitress added herself a 5.00 tip for a 12 to 13.00 bill. The tip amount was not the problem but adding the tip herself definitely is, that is theft. I called the restaurant to express my concern about the incident and they just tried to brush it off in a way that gave me the impression this happens often. I emailed and called the corporate office, this is when they heard me. THAT IS THEFT!!",

    "text": "Okay let me start off with...it was a Thursday night, NCAA tourney night and 60 cent wing night at Buffalo Wild Wings...so I expected it to be a little crazy.  We had a group of twenty from our church having a going away gathering for one of our friends.  That being said.  It was crowded, and LOUD in the bar area, but we opted for first available seating so I guess I can't be too picky.  But for me, the whole bar area is sensory overload for this ol' gal.  I am trying to watch what I'm eating so I had perused the menu before going and had already decided what I would get.  Grilled Chicken Salad with honey mustard dressing.  It was still very high in sodium and cholesterol, but one of the better choices (you can email and request a pdf file of their nutrition information, but it's not on their website...WHY?) anyhoo..that was my pick.  What I didn't know is that the grilled chicken would be tossed in the slightly tangy honey mustard AND served with a cup for pouring over your salad.  They are not my doctor, but dang...how can you manage to pack 640 calories, 38 grams of fat, 790 mg of sodium and 155 mg of cholesterol into a SALAD withOUT dressing...geez!   Our waitress was really great and got eveyone's order correctly...the biggest issue I had was that our food came out all at different times...which is annoying! I did enjoy my salad but the dressing was not really that good so I doubt I'd get it again.  My husband got two different wings and was happy with them.    I wasn't UN happy with our visit, but it's definitely not my scene - and I highly doubt that I am  their target market...although if the Tarheels were in the tourney still...I'd have been hollering with everyone else!  But that's not Buffalo Wild Wings fault...my meal was less than $9 and I was more than full when I left, so I'll give this visit three stars and leave it at that!",

    "text": "Symbolic of the rapid decline of this brand  You know a chain is in dire financial shape when the wait staff are berating you to order an appetizer before you've even settled in your chair.  The desperation hangs in the air.  If you've even glanced at a newspaper business section then you know that chicken prices have increased and that Buffalo Wild Wings management spend plenty of time moaning about it.  Oddly enough, you don't hear McDonald's management moaning about beef prices - they talk about ways to improve service and retain and/or attract customers.  BWW have decided to play three-card monte and change traditional, easy-to-understand order sizes of a half-dozen or a dozen wings to nonsensical quantities of 10 or 15.  The bartenders (I use the term loosely) were apparently suffering from some group form of ADHD.  I can confirm that they wear jersey #82 (the year of BWW founding) as a uniform because their backs were turned to me 90% of the time.  The rest of the time they were elsewhere, er, serving tables.  Hang on - isn't that what the numerous wait staff on duty are supposed to be doing?  The lonely beer drinker could only stare balefully at his empty glass while the bartenders were - no joke -busying themselves pouring glasses of ice water to serve to toddlers seated in the bar area.  Priorities!  I hear two year olds tip well!  The Rube Goldberg-esque insanity was unending.  Wait staff would deliver food to the end of the bar and the bartenders would take the trays to the table.  Why?!?!  Isn't this a misuse of both parties' time and a contradiction, considering the wait staff are already on the restaurant floor?  In addition to a beer, I ordered club soda.  I got ice water.  When I was asked if I wanted a refill,  I declined since they had failed the first time around.  The glass, only half-empty at that point, was snatched away and dumped, along with any thought of finishing it.  Printed, updated bar tabs are always kept in a small glass in front of the customer, therefore there is no need to ask for the check.  Knowing this, I placed my credit card on top of the tab in plain sight...where it sat for 15 full minutes, ignored as studiously as its owner.  Half the bar seats were empty on a Saturday evening i.e. peak hours.  Either people have given up on this location, on this chain, or both.  I've been a loyal customer in multiple states but experienced enough apathy in one night to put me off for good.",

Or in this case ANY service at all. and no it wasn't just my waitress, this was a group effort. My waitress fell off the face of the earth, and I just needed one of the other waitresses to go tell her I needed her. But THEY ALL - ALL OF THEM - turned their heads and opened that patio door and walked away.More than once for some of them. group effort. When I finally caught a waitress's direct look - I told her I wanted my check. instead of being there for the whole football game.  Now I gotta go find another place to watch football and smoke. Not an easy task in Charlotte - a patio with TVs that lets you smoke. SO THAT tells you how bad its here - I am going to give up this near by find because the service was that bad.  Sit at the bar is my advice for you that dont need the patio...........",

We sat and watched the wait staff make multiple stops at other tables patiently waiting for someone to stop at our table. After 15 minutes without a single server acknowledging we decided it was enough. We politely got up and made our way back to the hostess stand and informed them that no one even stopped by the table let alone take a drink order or talk about food. The hostess response was \"Oh, OK\" and took our game boards and watched us walk out.  We got in our car and drove to another nearby restaurant for dinner. My wife and kids went in to get a table while I decided to call and talk to the manager to inform them of the opportunity for improvement in their dining area. The manager was nice and apologized and wished me a good evening after I told him we went to a different restaurant for dinner. 3 minutes later when I joined my family inside the they were seated and already had drinks for the table.   It's a pity. The previous visit to BWW with the family also resulted in us waiting an extended period of time for service after the initial order was taken which resulted in us not returning for months. Tonight we decided to give them another shot and received the same deplorable service. No idea on when/if we will return, which is a shame as I am a big fan of their Caribbean Jerk wings.",

The fries were crispy and the sweet tea was good.  Staff kept coming by the table asking if I needed anything else.  Overall excellent service, the food was indeed better than I would expect from a chain, and will likely go again in the near future.",

There were 4 of us eating, and we would have to stop our server to ask for refills constantly. Talked to a manager, an older guy, possibly the GM? I'm not sure. But every time we would have to track our server down she wouldn't even stop at the table to see what we needed, she would talk to us as she kept walking to go somewhere else, and handed us sauces and other things over the back of the seats and over the wall beside our table.

We got our own drinks at the bar after waiting for 20 minutes. Then we waited for another 15 minutes to order food. Then we stopped a waitress to help us to order food. She helped us to order food but it took another 15 minutes to arrive and she never showed up again for a long long time. We didn't get water, plates or napkins. We went and got our own drinks at the bar again. We got napkins from the bar.  There were very few people in the restaurant and the service is completely unacceptable!!. There was no manager on duty or the manager was watching a game probably with some drinks.  The waitress show up when it is time for check. She told us that we don't need to pay for drinks and she apologized us for poor service. We paid the check and ready to leave then the Bartender came with a check and our main waitress vanished. There was no training or minimal training provided to the staff here. Come on BWLD you can do much better. I have experienced much better service before here. I am giving 2 stars for the service I got previously but for this service I give zero stars.",

Noisy - to be expected during the second half of the Panthers' game. Emily greeted me, tried my phone number for the rewards program and guided me through the set up to join. When the network didn't allow it to go through, she didn't waste my time but let me know I can sign up through the app and scan my receipt so I don't lose the points. I paid and she went to check my order. She was back in a flash with my order and sent me on my way with a smile. The young lady that greeted me on my way in also had a smile and farewell as I left.  Ordered traditional wings, size Medium, half garlic Parmesan, half chipotle bbq, crispy with celery and ranch. 7 wings in each container, nicely crispy but not overdone.  Tubs of ranch and bags of celery were in a separate small bag. Garlic Parmesan was tasty with enough sauce for good flavor but not too much to be sloppy. Only got to have one because my little scarfed them down. The dry rub chipotle bbq have a nice heat to them.   Only thing better than the wings was getting back home in time to see the Panthers get the turnover at the end of the game to keep the win.",

    "text": "Recently, I've been trying to find a \"go-to\" place to watch all the craziness this football season.  There are a plethora of sports bars and places to go, but I am still searching for the place that has the perfect amount of TVs, great food, and awesome service.  This BWW is located in Rivergate, in the south Charlotte burbs.  You have to drive out, pass Carowinds, and still go a little further to reach it, but there are plenty of parking spaces... It is tucked in behind the main shopping center intersection so probably contributes to less of a crowd inside.  The staff is nice-enough, but they weren't completely slammed and busy... so I expected service to be on par (and it was).  I ended up getting a new offering on their menu.. a sampler (which now that I think about it... is probably not new - just new to me)..... So 5 wings, chili-cheese fries, cheese curds, and fried pickles.  Wings were okay.  The curds and fried pickles were good (hard to mess up anything fried)... the fries came with FRESH-CUT jalapenos WITH seeds... so each fry bite ended up being a fun game of \"am I going to feel my tongue after this\" but we survived.  We had a little one with us (yes my friends have offspring now) so they were accommodating and luckily, she was very good that afternoon having a nice long nap before we headed out to watch football.  Overall this BWW is just like all the rest of them... lots of seating inside and out (large outdoor patio with lots of TVS as well).  Would I come back to watch games here?  Probably... I like a relaxed atmosphere for the most part - except I would be the crazy fantasy football guy yelling at multiple tv's for no apparent reason.",

I was excited to move so close to one but unfortunately both visits the experience was average due to super slow service.  The last visit in particular the service was painfully slow. I came in with a group of 6 when it wasn't crowded. It took over half an hour after ordering it for my drink to come out. We got bone in wings instead of the boneless that were ordered. It also took forever to get the checks.  The food was still on point when it came out and I love their new (or at least new to me) buffalo mac and cheese. I would suggest coming here when you are not hungry because by the time your food comes out you will be. I am sure I will return to watch some games and .65 boneless wing Thursdays but I am in no rush to go back.",

Last time we were here our server gave us wings with bones when we requested boneless and gave me the wrong side. Also, after waiting for our correct order of wings ( which were given 15 minutes after the other food arrived), they didn't comp them. I'm not a sucker for free things, but when the server clearly doesn't do their job right you should receive something in return. I couldn't tell if she was new/nervous or just didn't seem to care. We also had to ask numerous times for drink refills.   The food, when correct, had always been good. You can't go wrong with wings. They have a variety of sauces to choose from  my favorite is the spicy garlic. I also love the chicken wrap with the mango jalapeno sauce. It's spicy, but good!   On the bright side, I've ordered takeout a couple of times from here and had good experiences with it. Maybe that's the route we should go moving forward.",

So as my stomach is growling, for what seems like a half of eternity, the food finally arrives.

We had our first visit to this location the day we arrived, a couple weeks ago. We were there during lunch so there weren't many people at all. The food took an abnormally long time to come out, considering the lack of customers.   Ok, fine. Maybe it was just one of \"those days\".    Fast forward to today. It is a Tuesday, we arrived at 7 pm. No wait, both sections had customers but not a lot. After putting in our order of: 2 orders of wings with veggies and dressing, queso & chips, a cheeseburger and drinks.  We waited 1 hour before getting our food.   A solid 30 minutes into the wait my husband's drink was empty and when asked if he needed another it took another 15 minutes before he said \"forget it\" and went to the bar himself for a refill.  Finally, our food is coming!! Yaaayy! It's a little after 8pm and I'm hangry but whatever, it's time to grub!!  NOPE, NOPE, NOPE! One of the orders of wings came out (mine), the queso and cheeseburger. No sauces, no celery/carrots, no 2nd order of wings. So, the runner takes my order of wings back to make sure she gets the sauce and grabs the other wings. Which mind you weren't even made. She brings back both orders but one is now the wrong order, still no sauces or veggies. Oh My God. I patiently wait for my sauce to arrive. Then finally 15 minutes after all of this here she comes! Yay!! (FYI she is not even our server.)  Again, NOPE.  The other order of wings came but still no sauce, no veggies. I don't eat wings without my sauce. Period. It only takes what?, one minute to grab a sauce. Hell no. It took another 10 minutes!!! What in the HELL?  So, 1.5 hours have went by and I'm waiting for sauce, my wings are now cold to the touch and the sauce finally comes still no veggies....immediately I asked for the check and boxes because there was no way in hell I'm taking a chance on how long it could be before I get warmed wings.  I finally got home and microwaved my wings and was able to eat at 9:10 pm. 2 hours and 10 minutes later.   Lesson learned...THIS LOCATION SUCKS AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A SERIOUS REVIEW OF MANAGEMENT. Hopefully this takes place sooner than later, we would hate to have to drive passed this place to go to another BDubbs!   Word to the wise. Skip this place and google the next closest location!!!!!",

    "text": "Slow, slow, slow. Over an hour for our order and then we ordered some wings to go. They took another 30 minutes. Seriously, these are fried and sauced wings. The place was busy but not terribly busy. There were open tables, so it wasn't packed. You'll need to bring your patience because it's slow.  Service was not great. Our waitress was friendly but she missed a few things. We did not get the celery we ordered with the dine-in wings or with the to go order. She also \"upgraded\" us to the large on the to go instead of the medium we requested. Because we were finally bored after 90 minutes, I made the mistake of just giving her my credit card so I never did manage to see what we actually paid for.  Our waitress also disappeared for a solid 25 minutes. Like, gone. I don't know where she was but she absolutely was not in the dining room or we would have ordered our to go order sooner.  The only highlights here is that they will mix wing sauce flavors. With a large, we got four different sauces and three pots of ranch/blue cheese.  We were overcharged, we missed stuff, we did not get good service.  I will not be back. There are other, better wing places in this part of Charlotte including Wild Wings, Wing King and East Coast for a start.  [Review 11258 overall, 1034 of 2019.]",

    "text": "I hate leaving one star reviews but this place really just kept getting worst the longer we were here. We came here on a whim around 9:30 or so pm because wild wings had to close early tonight. It took a little while for us to get seated but it did look like there was a rush before us that was dying down so understandable. We ended up sitting down and the first thing I noticed was how sticky the tables were...not sure why? We weren't asked what we wanted to drink. We waited again for a minute for a server, finally someone came and asked if anyone served us yet and we said no and placed our order. Based on how slow their service was so far, I made sure we placed our order as well. We ended up getting our ultimate appetizer before our drinks. I had to ask another random server for water. The other girl seem to have an attitude I guess because we weren't her table? Our server then came back and apologized and gave us water.   When we finally got our food and we were highly disappointed. The wings weren't that good, they were very dry. Mines were at least covered in a good amount of sauce so it wasn't too bad for me to eat. My friend on the other hand had more of an issue, a lot of her wings weren't even sauced much as (you can see from the pictures below) so she didn't eat much of her food.  She's also more of a wing lover than me so I did feel her pain lol. The server didn't come back to check on us after delivering the food and asking if we needed anything else until we asked for the check. So naturally we didn't get our drinks refilled.   After receiving our check my friend went to use the restroom and the server came back asking if I was ready to pay (there was no card or cash out yet to pay). I definitely noticed that after receiving the check, our server was more attentive, more so to cleaning and getting us out though. I felt very rushed at this point to leave. She kept coming back saying if she could clean more. I honestly didn't even want to leave a tip because of the poor service but that's not like me so I left tip but overall based on the service and food I will not return to this location. I will stick to wild wings.",

I just don't understand why they can't seem to get the to go area part of this location to be the same as the dining in experience. I can't say I have ever been satisfied with any of my to go experiences the only reason we even order out is because is difficult to eat in with a toddler. Food order is never correct or something is missing, whoever helps you with your to go order more than likely has an attitude if you inform them that your order is incorrect. If eating in you will enjoy your lunch or dinner. But just make sure to check your to go order twice before leaving.",

Well this past week I had a craving for their wings and I was in the area so I reluctantly stopped in. There were several tables requiring bussed and no one to great nor seat us up front. We waited about 3or 4 minutes and realized it was hopeless and left. I suppose that was the last straw so to speak. They weren't busy at all but apparently too busy for us.

I asked to speak to the Manager and let her know there was a table available and since we were there to watch the game (like everyone else!), we really just wanted to sit and have a couple beers and were in no rush for food anyways. While all this going on, another couple took the table with no wait. She comes back (manager is a female, short with long dark hair in a ponytail) and offered us to share a table with another guy who had just ordered a beer. Ridiculous can't even describe this manager!!  Common sense tells you if you have a long wait and there are open tables (because the Manager is telling the hostess not to seat anyone), disorganization and people just taking tables unfortunately is the next scenario. Other than being offered a wonderful option of sharing a table with a complete stranger (which she approached him on and he did not offer up himself...awkward??), we were offered nothing else. We will NEVER go back!!!",

The servers either travelled in herds or were invisible, but either way they seemed to ignore us.   Some of the other food was pretty good, but when wings are in your name, you expect a lot.",
