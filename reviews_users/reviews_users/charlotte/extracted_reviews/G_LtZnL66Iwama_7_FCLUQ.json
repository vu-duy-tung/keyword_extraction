    "text": "I have passed Baku many times, wondering what it's like.  A client encouraged me to try it, so we did.  The food was delicious.  Everything we ordered was perfectly done and beautifully presented.  We had the soft shell crab salad, the sea bass skewers, the seared blue fin tuna, the wagyutataki roll, the sea bass entree and another skewer that I can't remember. We also had red and white wine.  The waiter was very nice and helpful.  The wine pours were average and the selection good.  The reason I gave it four stars and not five, is because it's confusing to order.  They have a lot of small plates and honestly, they are just as filling as the entrees, which are small. They are priced similarly, so we ended up over-ordering which was yummy but ran up the bill significantly. The freshness and uniqueness of the menu is almost worth the price. Yes, I said almost, which means I will be back but not next week. The atmosphere, though a little \"cold\" is calming like a spa. I do recommend this place.  It will not disappoint a good Charlotte foodie or a visitor to the area. Compliments to the chef.",

    "text": "I decided to write a review since they seem to be so mixed on here- and I almost didn't want to come thinking I would be disappointed. We started out at the upstairs bar with a couple Nigori Blue Martinis- Belvedere unfiltered vodka dirty martinis, so good we never even switched to wine during the meal, we just kept these comin'. Only $11- good deal. We sat downstairs at a booth, our server was awesome, all the staff seemed very polite.   Now- the food. We ordered a variety and shared everything. Favorite thing hands down was the tuna tartare with what I think were taro root chips- this stuff was heaven in your mouth. Other plates that really stood out were the salmon belly nigiri, rock shrimp tempura, and the yellowtail roll with serrano peppers, cucumber and avocado. Crispy calmari with serrano peppers was good too. We also tried the wagyu beef tataki, gokujo tuna roll, lobster & avocado roll, and of course we had to get the giant Madagascar prawn. Everything was delicious!! All of the presentation was beautiful and the plates rolled out a few at a time so we had a chance to really enjoy them. Decor is really cool, great vibe and relaxing & inviting atmosphere. Extensive sake list, will have to explore more next time. It was a great dining experience- I can't wait to try their brunch. Will definitely be back again!",

    "text": "I don't get why so many people are raging  about this place. Here's my tale of disappointment:  Went here last night since everyone that I knew of was telling me that I gotta try it and that my fellow yelpers said some of the reviews here are just flat out lies. So I came here to accomplish both goals of getting the experience first-hand and write a honest review.   So, back to the story, I came in (had a appointment at 10pm) and I immediately notice the type of people that goes here. Let me tell you, I'm from a pretty well-off family, so I know the difference between wealthy people and snobby ones that doesn't have the money but just act like they do. And I noticed there were ton of those snob. Which is strike one on my list.   Later on at 10:10 pm I was asked to be seated in the back of the room which I'm not fond of since I prefer seating in single seat but oh well. The waiter then gave me a tour through the menu, however, he only went over wines and sake, saying how great their drinks are. I had to ask him about foods, and he wasn't really sure about the sushi when I asked him questions on how fresh it is. Minus another point.  After ordering, the waiter brought out my wine and assuming that I paid nearly $50 that I would get a pretty decent wine (and the waiter even recommended it) I was extremely dissatisfied. I've travel to France and know what good wines are, and let me tell you, the one that Baku serves you are cheap quality wines for extremely ripoff price. You can buy it for 1/3 of the cost!  Now, onto the foods.  Disappointing also... The presentation look good but the taste and quality is a c- on my book. The steak was bleh since it wasn't flavorful (even though they said they are well known with using organic charcoals to make their grill foods delicious).  The duck meats was still kind of raw (goodness gracious) and the plum didn't suit with the duck meat. Their flavors were too different to be combined which made the dish taste unsettling.  Sushi.... Just flat out no. Sushi didn't taste fresh and way too watery. And the sauce that they used did not compliment the sushi, rather it hinders it by creating sour taste.   I don't mind price when it comes to food that are worth it. But when I receive foods that are poorly made, then my friend, I'm quite pissed off. If you want to go here and show off that you have money and claim that it's delicious then go right on ahead. But if you're like me, who actually prefer True culinary skills then this place isn't worth for you to come.   Well, that is the end of my extremely long story of woe. xox",

We started with two small plates: pork dumplings and the glazed chicken wings. They were both excellent. I really enjoyed the fresh lime and coarse salt that was served with the wings. It made the dish very flavorful. We also ordered the salmon and the chef's selection sashimi. The flavor and texture of the salmon was wonderful. It may have been the best salmon I've ever had. The sashimi was also good.  It was cut a little thick for my personal taste, but it was fresh and enjoyable.   The atmosphere is cute (trendy and welcoming). The service was excellent! Our waitress was knowledgeable and made great wine recommendations. Two thumbs up. I'll definitely be back!!",

    "text": "A second review for one place? Still amazing. They've recently opened for brunch, and I absolutely had to stop in and try what they had working up. Here's my thoughts!  \"Viking-style Brunch\"   Fruit box - a variety of seasonal fruits served on bed of ice. Great to nibble on while waiting on my other guests to arrive. Enjoyed very fresh squeezed orange juice.   Liege Waffles - absolutely amazing. Lightly crisped waffles served with this great spread selection. Chocolate ginger and white chocolate mousse. We mixed them together. Incredible.   Sous Vide Eggs - sweet potato hash compliments the duck pastrami and egg that's cooked to a nice creamy perfection. All of this is drizzled with a yuzu hollandaise.. Making a very eclectic spin on the traditional brunch eggs Benedict.   There is a sushi cart offered with a widespread variety of rolls, sashimi and nigiris. We nibbled lightly on this .. Wanting to fill up on the brunchy goodness.   You're then offered a salad for the table... And we each got to select an entree. I chose the spicy filet... Always a favorite. My guests chose the jiodori chicken and the salmon teriyaki. We also devoured their wild mushroom kamamashi pot. Great warm ending to the meal. Especially for a rainy brunch Sunday.   I definitely recommend pairing your brunch with bubbles. We paired our waffles and eggs with the Moet Rose, but they offer a great list of bubbles and cocktails to start your Sunday off right.   Overall, Baku impresses again. For $36 a guest...to eat such an impressive array... Definitely a go-to brunch spot for something delicious that's a fresh change of pace.",

    "text": "I have such a hard time paying a hefty price for Asian food...I don't care how it's packaged...even if it's in a kettle hot pot. That said, however, this is a great new addition to SouthPark. Solid 3 stars and A-OK in my book.  Old world Asia meets modern New South. It's well polished and upscale sporting modern decor and loud \"clubby\" music while the menu boasts of old Asian traditions...didn't quite feel congruent, but I guess it works. In any case, the food was very good and very pricey. If you really want to impress someone or a client, this place is surely on par. Order many rounds of small plates and 3 or 4 will make any diner happy and leave with a full Buddha belly.  Valet and servers are friendly and eager to serve. Valet is in the front and regular parking is in the back or the parking garage/deck at the building next door.  Like I mentioned, great new restaurant, but not one that I'll become a regular. With those prices and atmosphere, I really have to be dolled up and have money to burn.",

The fella and I visited on a Wednesday night after making Open Table reservations, and we parked in the back to avoid the valet.  Upon entering, literally seven Baku staff members were lined up to the right of the door to... welcome us?  Bizarre.  We headed upstairs to have a drink since the downstairs bar was already a little crowded.  Our bartender was nice, but fully admitted she was having an off night after making the wrong drink then spilling the right drink.  Oy.  The decor is really cool - dark walls, orange fans on the ceiling, painted eyes on the wall staring at you - the staff are all very chic and sleek.  It definitely has a clubby vibe.  Onto the food!  After our drink, we were seated upstairs. Our waiter was awesome - he was so gracious and helpful and didn't even make fun of me when I had to ask for a fork (chopsticks aren't my forte).  The fella and I got a bottle of wine and ordered three of the small plates/appetizers so that we could try a little bit of everything.    * The pork belly skewers were good, but there wasn't a ton of flavor, and they were TINY.  We got two skewers with two tiny pieces on each. * The rock shrimp tempura tasted very fresh and light, and since there were six pieces, I got to take a few more bites than of the pork belly. * Lastly, we ordered the beef and asparagus skewers, which were good, but nothing to write home about.  There were three tiny pieces of beef and one piece of asparagus.  Two drinks at the bar cost $11 and $12 + tip.  Dinner was a $50 bottle of wine and those three small plates cost more than $60... then we added tip.  The moral of the story is that Baku thinks A LOT of their tiny portions, and I had to eat a real dinner when I got home.  Cool, hip ambiance and excellent service, but I just can't justify the price for what you get.",

    "text": "BF & I dined here this past Saturday. We got here a little before 630 & apparently the entire restaurant was booked with reservations, with the exception of the bar & the patio. It was pretty nice outside, so we decided to sit out on the patio. Our server was extremely knowledgeable. They have an extensive list of sake, & I'm not a sake expert but I decided you can't go wrong with the flavored ones. I got the fuji apple sake & my BF opted for the lychee sake.. both were great but the fuji apple was my favorite!  They have a few vegetarian items on the menu. The ones I remember are coal roasted shishito peppers, a couple of mushroom maki rolls, some type of sweet & sour tofu skewer, & wild mushroom kamameshi pot. I decided to get the peppers & was almost going to choose one of the sushi rolls, but I decided to try the kamameshi pot instead. The peppers do come with bonito flakes sprinkled on top, so we got them in a separate little bowl. My BF got the tempura tiger prawns, beef & asparagus skewers, & soft shell crab maki roll.  The shishito peppers came out first. They were tasty & not really spicy. They came with a little dipping sauce made of soy sauce & chili flakes. $7 was a little steep for a plate of peppers but I enjoyed them & would get them again.  The tempura tiger prawns came out next.. $12 for 5 pieces of fried shrimp.. what?? I kind of laughed when the prawns came out because at that price we were expecting at least ONE more to make it an even $2 per prawn. I did not eat them & while my BF seemed to like the prawns, he said they weren't really anything special.  Next up was the wild mushroom kamameshi pot. It came to the table unstirred, but I was unable to get a picture of it at the time because our server stirred it while explaining the dish. I enjoyed the flavors but again felt it was overpriced at $17 for some rice, mushrooms, & a few vegetables. The nice touch was that the rice on the bottom was a little crispy from the hot pot.. love it!  My BF got his beef & asparagus skewers (I think it came with 2) & soft shell crab roll. The skewers looked much better in person than that shitty picture I posted (blame the BF for that!) I think he liked the skewers & the roll was comparable to Cowfish prices but definitely not in size & taste.. Cowfish wins that hands down! I don't remember the exact prices of these 2 dishes individually, but together they must have been around $25 based on our bill.  Overall, the service was great, sake was awesome, & the food, while good, was definitely overpriced. We weren't particularly blown away by any of the dishes which is kinda disappointing for a meal close to $100 (including the tip). We will probably be back because my BF wants to try the duck & a couple of other grilled meat dishes, but Baku will likely not be in our regular rotation.",

Baku is a high end restaurant so I'm not coming here every night as much as I would like too but if you do come you will be able to try lots of different kind of fish you won't find in charlotte expect maybe Yama Asian fusion.

It is very pricey but I really enjoyed the tuna maki roll, eggplant pot stickers and hot tea that I ordered.  The reason I am giving this 3 stars is because of he prices and atmosphere. The sushi was great but not anything special, for the prices they are charging, it better be the best sushi ever.   The atmosphere was a little too pretentious for me, they had club music playing and it really seemed like a place that people went to just to look cool.  Overall, good food but the atmosphere was not at all what I wanted.",

The Alaskan crab roll was one of my favorites. The food is mostly tapas style meant to share... and most of the small plate portions are a little small.   Everything grilled is cooked on a Japanese grill with coals imported from Japan which gives it a very unique flavor. Their black cod was excellent... I'm gonna say it reminded me of Nobu's... though the execution was a little off. All their beef is prime, we also had the Waygu NY strip and it was delicious.   Cocktails were ok, nothing out of this world and the service was decent. Overall I think they did a good job, albeit the NY city prices... this is a place good for an expense account.",

It took an hour and a half to get some food. Food came wrong. I just cancelled the rest of the little order I've placed. It wasn't busy! When I asked to complain the manager had excuses. Before he even came to the table he was ready with: \"sorry you waited for the sushi\". Argued that the bar was busy when I came. (Hello, I was there...). Waitress and her manager just said: yes we know... about the lack of service. Horrific service. Hard to believe with this type of service, they are still in business. Or maybe no one cares. If I was management and found out about that, I would not be happy! Unless yet again, they don't know and no one cares. Enough people would go there anyway (until one day they'd stop...).

    "text": "Foodgasmic oysters and king crab legs!!  Seriously, they are MIND-BLOWING amazing!  I am a lover of fresh seafood, especially oysters and crab legs; it is very rare to find oysters and crab legs that blow my mind because it all essentially tastes the same.  That said, I also had a range of very good, good enough and blech dishes at the same meal; hence, the 4 stars.  OK AMBIENCE.  We have seen Baku numerous times on our way to South Park Mall and wondered if it was like Zuma (my BFs all-time favorite restaurant upon which all other pan-Asian | Asian fusion restaurants are compared).  The answer?  Not quite.  There is a cute patio outside that was much too hot for us to enjoy, maybe next time.    Inside, it tries to be trendy and hip like a Morimoto, Hakkasan or any other modern vibey LA/Miami Asian restaurant but sort of falls flat and feels a little dated and underwhelming.  I can't quite put my finger on what makes me feel this way, maybe the really bad lighting or the cramped quarters (even though the restaurant was sparsely attended).  It just didn't feel upscale (and not in the minimalist way either).   MEDIOCRE SERVICE.  The service was exactly on par with what you would expect from an upscale restaurant.   There was nothing remarkable about the service.  They can improve by wiping down the table between courses when they're clearing off the plates.  This isn't something that I usually notice but if I feel like I need to put my napkin on top of my table, that's a really good sign that it needs a good wipe down.  Overall, the service was fine; our food was served, cleared away and drinks refilled promptly and courteously.    ALCOHOL.  We had a Moscow mule and a fruity concoction that I asked the bartender to prepare; they were heavy on the alcohol pour but mixed wonderfully as to maintain their intended flavors.    A WIDE ARRAY OF CULINARY PERFORMANCE.  If it weren't for the oysters and crab legs, I may have given the experience 3 or 3.5 stars, right around average.  I've had:   AMAZING:  +++  oysters. When they were served, we were told to be prepared to have the best oyster experience ever. He was absolutely right.  I usually want to throw all the fixings on: cocktail sauce, horseradish, tabasco, salt, pepper, and lime -- but the sweetness, and the soft buttery texture of these divine oysters eradicated the need for the extras.  It was like these oysters weren't farmed in the ocean at all, they didn't have any salty or gritty texture to them at all; truly,  they were unlike any of their usual counterparts. +++  Alaskan crab legs. The crab legs were meaty, sweet and didn't have a fishy aftertaste at all.  They serve it in this heavenly lemon butter ponzu sauce that just perfectly complements the sweetness.  The portion is huge enough that my BF and I barely polished it off.    VERY GOOD:  +++  crispy rock shrimp.  The shrimps were crispy and served with a hot mustard sauce, very similar to Zuma. +++  traditional miso. It threw me off that it's sweet and a little sour but the fresh scallops in it really made me grow fond of it.   +++  spicy tuna roll. Very fresh, densely complex and quite spicy.    OK:  +++  yellowtail.  You get three rolled up pieces.  This is fine if it was more complex than plain yellowtail such as a nice ponzu sauce or crispy tempura flakes (like Zuma does); it was good but not stellar.   +++  panacotti.  The fruit panacotti had vanilla custard that was pretty bland.  I'm not one for over decadent sweetness but the panacotti seemed to err at the opposite spectrum and left my palate wanting more.   BLECH:  +++  salmon tatake.  I LOVE albacore tatake that sits on a semi-sweet citrus ponzu sauce with stripped daikon.  This wasn't it.  The salmon is cooked, even with the fresh crab,  it's really not the right texture to turn into a tatake.   +++  mango toffee.  Too many nuts, the very dense cake didn't taste like mango -- Starbucks could have done a better dessert.   +++  pork belly.  The pieces are REALLY fatty and greasy; not in the savory bacon (yum!) way.  COME FOR THE OYSTERS AND CRAB LEGS.   If the oysters and king crab had been your run-of-the-mill variety, we probably wouldn't return because other than that, the only thing we would order again are the crispy shrimp.  However, the oysters and king crab legs are absolutely incredible and worth every penny of their market price tag.    10.7.2016 Update.  We went for a second time on a rainy Friday night and because it was busier, the service was slower.  I'd skip the desserts altogether next time.    I can see why others say that the portions are not commensurate to the hefty price tag.  I will definitely vouch for the freshness and premium quality of their seafood (for example, in contrast, Cowfish uses imitation crab in their rolls).  That being said,  if you come here, stick to the popular food items or fresh sushi because not everything on their menu will otherwise garner a satiating dining experience.",

For some reason I wasn't interested in it, but now I am really glad we got that gift card, because it was a really enjoyable experience.   We sat upstairs in an area that seems like the bar/lounge section, and it was nice. Our server was lights out (baseball reference).  She was on top of everything, extremely friendly and helpful, and all of her suggestions were great.  It was Friday night, so I am guessing she was on their A squad.   The menu has tons of small plate variety, and it seemed like everything we ordered was great.  Chicken meatballs, NY strip tataki, corn, kimchi, pork dumplings, etc.  Our server said they cook the food over some imported hot stones (I only eat off the finest stones)...which I guess is a good thing, because everything tasted great.   For dessert, I highly recommend the truffles.  There are a lot of good things happening in this dessert. The presentation of the food is excessive and awesome (ice everywhere, food floating on various towers, and I think I saw some gold bullion in the background). The actual dessert tastes great, too. The truffles taste like chocolate batter and they come in this almond brittle cup.  There is also this ice cream perched on top of an ice sculpture, which is no slouch either.  We'll definitely be back to Baku in the near future,",

First off I love the ambiance of this restaurant. It's quiet and spacious which makes it super enjoyable for a romantic date night or night out with friends.  We got the Himachi (done both ways), pork dumplings, crispy brussel sprouts, NY strip, Salmon and split the chocolate cake for dessert. The apps were incredible and the Himachi (sashimi style and spicy atop a fried rice cake) were to die for. Everything came out quick, hot and in waves which I love when sharing plates. The only thing I was disappointed about was the dessert. It was not worth the extra $5. The portion size and dessert itself was mediocre.   The rest of the portions and plates were incredible. Simplistic but complex and definitely delicious! Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "I've visited Charlotte several times and always wanted to try this place. Well, I finally did a couple weeks ago and unfortunately I wasn't impressed. Our group of four ordered:  Rock Shrimp: The sauce served on the side is a little different from what I've had at other places, too much mayo. But anything fried tastes good :-) Wild Mushroom rice pot: Best dish we ordered and the most filling. Get this! Omakase (for 4 people for $20/each): beautifully presented and so fresh, but there's literally one piece for each person. So 4 octopus, 4 salmon, 4 oysters, etc (see pic) Chicken/Onion Yakitori: A little salty, had too many burnt edges. Still good enough to eat. Pea Blossom Maki Roll: 6 small pieces. nothing memorable   While the food was good and the seafood was fresh it just didn't blow me away. At these prices- either increase the portion size, have amazing top notch service, or decrease your prices.  Also, there was a piece of hair weaved into the basket our rock shrimp was served in. We immediately told our server, and he brought out a new batch. However, it would have been nice if he had communicated that dish would be comp'ed bc the whole time we were thinking how bad the service is since most restaurants would comp it. Only later to find out when the bill came they did comp it! But it's pointless when you're in a bad mood throughout the entire meal.   Another minor incident was a dirty sauce dish. Glad we noticed before using it for our sushi!  Maybe it was just an off day...but I just can't justify the food and prices when I can get the same thing in ATL for so much cheaper and better service!  Fyi- the guys were still hungry, so they each ate a bowl of pho afterwards. LOL",

The quality of the fish is unreal, but the creativity takes it up multiple notches. This is now our favorite date night spot. The salmon belly sashimi has such amazing flavor that we start and END with it. I want the flavors to linger in my mouth and mind until we get to visit again. Sit at the sushi bar, the chefs are great and will help customize dishes. I'm allergic to shellfish and my husband isn't so they customized a roll to have half with and half without. No other sushi restaurant has ever done that. Can't wait until our next visit.",

The brussel sprouts were the leafs of the sprouts and very few solid pieces of Brussel sprouts. This was a side dish for $9  My friend enjoyed her sushi.

Small bites, Calamari, Beef & Asparagus & their incredible mushrooms. Not nearly the crowd they once had. We don't order the Chicken Yakatori anymore since I found myself chewing and swallowing what I suddenly realized was chicken cooked on the outside and raw on the inside. I panicked then (last thing I need is Salmonella) & our server said they had just sent an order of that back for the same reason - there is a special way to cook done on the Robata grill, and if they get it wrong (chefs keep changing - not master chef I think but whoever is on the Robata, and they mess up). And again I reiterate - THEY KEEP BLASTING THIS HORRIFIC, ELECTRONIC, DARK AND MISERY INDUCING MUSIC. We sat outside before 6PM when nobody was there, so we asked they turn it way down outside. It was done and someone then turned it way back up. This is a pricey place, supposed to be a Japanese restaurant and any music should be soft, melodic and Japanese - not ELECTRONIC DRECK. Staff were all wonderful, so who is the nincompoop who insists on blasting lousy \"music\" that has no place anywhere other than a PORNO FLICK? Mr. \"Owner\" - are you listening, or are you just one of those \"old boys club\" guys who currently run this town/city? You are getting slammed on your salon Cutting Image and your casual BBQ place \"Tree House\".? No plans to go back to any of them. Better give a raise to your staff, I don't know how they can stand working there, they must all be good actors.",

This is most readily apparent in their menu, where they are outright stingy in their selections of what is available or plaster the menu with upcharges.  Very offputting.  Delightfully, Baku is NOT one of those.   It has a reputation for being a bit spendy, but they really don't hold back on the restaurant week selections.  We thoroughly enjoyed the salad course, the small plate course and the entree course.  Someone looking for volume of food might cast a critical eye -- Baku is a small plate concept.   But we appreciate quality over that and Baku delivered in spades.  The NY Strip was the big winner, though my m-i-l very much enjoyed her salmon.  Excellent preparation and presentation.    Sometimes a wait staff can make the Queen's Feast unpleasant as well, perhaps allowing the smaller check size to sour their attitude.  Again Baku came through with top marks.  Our staff was prompt, accurate and engaging.  Thoroughly enjoyed our first trip to Baku.  We will be back.  This is what restaurant week is supposed to be about.",

    "text": "Baku is named after a mythological dragon who eats bad dreams - my interest was immediately piqued after learning this.   I've been to Baku twice and never been disappointed by the cuisine or the breathtaking atmosphere. It's about time Charlotte gained an upscale establishment that isn't reeking of played out trends or beating that dead (and stuffy!) fine dining horse that should've been laid to rest years ago.  The Jidori Chicken breast was tender and savory, the mugi and miso soy glaze gives it a robust flavor that isn't overbearing or painfully salty as is the trend in some lesser establishments. The Day Boat Grouper Bites, Rock Shrimp Tempura and Tiger Prawns are tempura done perfectly - light and flaky, super fresh and unweighed down by excess greasiness or breading. I haven't had Red Miso soup since Nobu in NYC and was pleasantly surprised by Baku's take on Miso's not so common cousin. The Sweet Potato was also cooked perfectly - not stringy or undercooked, not drenched in sugar - and complimented our sushi (delicious yellowtail sashimi sliced thinly enough to melt in your mouth) amazingly well. However, my absolute favorite dish at Baku is the Giant Madagascar Prawn, hands down. I could eat a million of them and never get tired of them. Absolutely flawless.  The only thing I didn't love about Baku was the clearly condescending vibe given off by the Management. Guests seem to bug them and co-workers seem to bug them even more. A couple of people have commented on the posse of hosts that seem to be almost forcibly planted at the front door eager to open the door for you even when they're not busy at all which is, yeah... awkward. Add impersonal, nearly hawklike managers and you've got a slightly uninviting ushering in.  I haven't gotten the slightest clue what's up with that - Baku's food is heavenly, the atmosphere is killer, servers have always been efficient and helpful and hosts nothing but friendly and hospitable.",

Nothing really impressive. They spend a lot of money on wait staff..they are very quick to take away your dishes, even when you are not even done. You wait a long time between dishes...so few of us in the party just sat and watched while others ate their dinner plate. What a mess! If you want to spend that much money, go to Zebra next door and get better food. Or spend less and go to Yama or Cowfish! Will not go back again.",

Changed to the salad which was good with ginger dressing. About an hour after our apps we were served our dinners....all but one of my gfs.

So if you like the loud music and more a club feel, go upstairs.  If you prefer a quieter experience, stay downstairs.  As for the food, the menu is very big.  It was a little intimidating the first time and I spent too much time worrying  over what to order.  My advice is each person pick 3 or 4 things and then sit back and relax.  Things will come out as they are ready so delicious surprises show up at your table at a steady pace.  And trust the pairings your chef makes!  One of my favorites was the scallops with foie gras that came with some pickled plum.  Who knew but just a little of that plum with it made it perfect!  Try and be a little adventurous and let your servers help you with suggestions.  They have been spot on.  You can ring up a big tab here.  There are definitely some really pricey items.  But there are also plenty of reasonably priced things as well.    I have no complaints about the wait staff.  They have been courteous, helpful and knowledgeable every time.",

With that being said we had to wait a long time before we were greeted by our server. I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say they were not informed that we had been seated out there, even still quite a few other servers walked by a few times and they didn't even notice or offer to get someone for us. The sushi we ordered was not good at all. Especially for how expensive it was. If you like traditional sushi this is not the restaurant for you.  The saki was good but again, over priced.",

    "text": "Quality was good. Presentation was beautiful. Service was ok. They should've changed out our plates at least once during dinner as our plates were drenched in oils and flavors from the other dishes. The Uni Spoon ($10/each) was my favorite... had the perfect amount of caviar, truffle and uni, and the blend with the ponzu and quail egg was great! The A5-12 Japanese Wagyu Beef Nigiri ($8/pierce) with Burgundy Truffle and Hon Shiso was another one of my favorites.   I was very disappointed in the Salmon Belly Nigiris as that was what drew me into wanting to go to this restaurant. The salmon belly was fresh but the flavor was off because the chef had a big dab of mayonnaise on each piece.  The flavors did not go together and the mayonnaise took away the flavor of the fish. I feel that this was my main problem with this restaurant... the combination of flavors just did not go together. They would have fresh ingredients that are amazing even all on its own but then they would add something that overpowers the main ingredient. Another example was the yellowtail sashimi ($12 for 3 pieces)... the yellowtail was great, the truffle ponzu sauce was great but then they added this overpowering pickled smoky onion in it which in my opinion, totally ruined the dish and seems like such a waste of good quality fish. They could've added some onions but not so much where it was more than the fish itself. Another example was the Foiegras and Scallop dish ($28 for 2)... foiegras.. perfectly cooked, flavor was great... scallop... perfectly cooked, flavor was on point... and then they add this mint leaf that tasted like licorice in the middle which totally caught me by surprise and added this overpowering, pungent flavor that had a bitter aftertaste. Overall, good experience but disappointed in the dishes I was most excited to try.",

    "text": "I went to Baku with a local Charlotte friend who knew I was a foodie and thought I would appreciate this Japanese inspired restaurant.  Upon reaching the front door it was opened for us by a waitress who welcomed us with a smile.  We were seated in the main dining area (there is a lounge-y space upstairs).  It was a Tuesday night around 8:30 pm and the space was surprisingly full.  Subdued in its decorations, perfectly lighted so that you could clearly see what you ordered, the restaurant could easily exist in New York City or any other major metropolitan area.  Service was impeccable - our main waitress was attentive and genuinely enthusiastic.  A bevy of support folks attended our table as well.  It was evident that the owners were rigorous in their expectations for the front of the house and that staff were willing to execute in order to make those expectations happen.  My friend and I decided on a small plates for our meal.  I must say that I was somewhat put off by the voluminous menu; it had to have been 10 pages (including 3 pages of sake and other drinks) as well as 2 additional separate menus of \"specials.\"  So there were 3 menus in all!  I  felt like I needed to have studied and prepared prior to arrival.  It was a little overwhelming.  In the end, I questioned our waitress for recommendations which she was more than happy to do.  Along with cold sake (1/2 price bottles that evening YAY!), we had 8 small plates; each presented with a rigorous attention to detail.  You could tell these were chef conceived items and that he ran a tight ship.  From the sake bottle resting in an ice filled wooden box onward, every element of the food and its presentation is the vision of the chef.  We had first a plate of homemade kimchi, the cabbage tart and vinegary.  It was followed by a Hamachi dish - two thinly sliced pieces of delectably fresh fish atop a pickled mound of crunchy veg.  I would have liked a larger piece of fish as it was dwarfed by the pickled mound and kind of lost.  Charred baby octopus followed, plated in a long white ceramic runway.  Tasty and delicious, it offered a wonderful bite.  A tuna tartare was next, to be scooped up with homemade taro chips.  The chips were an unexpected item, a nice touch - the tartare; weak of seasoning fell flat as merely mushy.  We then had tempura shrimp.  When it came out, I was at first disappointed by the size of the shrimp - smallish and popcorn - like.  But after popping one in my mouth, I was amazed at how they remained so succulent and juicy after being deep-fried.  But they were.  And the tempura batter, thin and crisp, did not overpower.  A really delicious dish.  Next came pork belly with sous vide egg.  The pork belly was prepared nicely, fatty and flavorful.  I was very disappointed in the egg though as it was cold.  I told my waitress to let the chef know as I was sure he did not intend the warmth of the fatty delicious pork belly to be paired and eaten with a refrigerator-cold egg yolk.  I looked at my friend and said just you wait - a chef this meticulous would send us another so that we could enjoy as he intended.  He didn't - oh well.  Last we had scallops with foie gras.   It contained two big meaty succulent sea scallops adorned with slivers of foie gras, some sea salt and pickled plum on the side.  This was a winner; a choreographed ending to the savory portion of the meal.  Lastly, but not least - I had to have a dessert.  I ordered the chocolate ganache  cake with homemade coconut ice cream.  Need I say more?  A brilliant pairing - the cake's center was warm and gooey and the ice cream cold and coconutty - combined the two were unified into a wonderful yummy finale to the meal.",

We were seated upstairs by the bar which was quite loud.   Dining room was requested upon arrival.  Gentlemen, not our waiter, promptly brought us some water.  We then waited about 15 minutes before our actual waiter greeted us and began service.  Things were progressing fine until our second course arrived in which we found a hair in it.  Waited another 15 minutes before our waiter returned and at that time we informed of the \"hair\".  She saw it and made a horrific face and swiftly removed the dish.  Another was brought in its place, which was fine except there was no apology, no one came to speak with us, no comp, etc...  If the hair wasn't enough for a poor rating the service made it so.  It may not have been our servers fault as she appeared to be overwhelmed and possibly understaffed.    We will not be returning.",

For starters, as expected, the restaurant was indeed stylish...a cozy mix of rustic and city-chic decor.  Then came THE disappointment for the entire dining experience...the TINY table.  As I often dine out with my husband, it's fairly normal that we get the smaller tables in  most restaurants, but here at Baku, the table for two seemed a tad smaller than norm.  It might not have bothered me much if we simply opted for simple entree plates.  However, as recommended by the waiter, this was a restaurant that specialized in smaller plates (AKA tapas-style!).  Since the menu did feature many tantalizing appetizers and tapas-style items, we proceeded ordering at least half a dozen plates, along with soup, dessert and drinks.  Our table was completely overwhelmed...and honestly, it was an aggravating, near-claustrophobic foodie experience.  The menu was delightful, with many unique items...and all the foods were delicious.  I do want to add that some of their items, like the sushi that I ordered was way overpriced for what it was...but again, delicious.  Also, the waiter was very good...an obvious pro with years of experience.  Overall, I did like what Baku had to offer.  If my dining experience was more comfortable (bigger table!), I might have even given this 5 stars.",

They weren't really landing, but I appreciate the friendly attitude. Five star attitude, but the food was 3 stars.   The Brussels sprouts were hittin it. They taste just like the sprouts at Futo Buta. I don't know who ripped who off and I don't care, because truthfully that was the highlight of my meal.   The dumplings were aight. Something was off to me. Like the spices didn't meld well for me.   The salmon was actually pretty good with the side salad and sweet potatoes. The salmon was cooked medium and really fresh. I'm glad they serve Wild Caught because I don't do farm raised. The potatoes were soft and seasoned well. I liked the slice of lemon which I sprayed all over my dish.   Now unfortunately the portions were so small I had to order what was supposed to be a chocolate cake. The waiter recommended this and I was like \"Bet\" I'm bout to top my night off with something sweet and this will make up for the small toddler food portions of food I just got.   {Sigh} I think I got duped because my friggin cake tasted like one of those Little Debbie cakes. I paid $5 and could have purchased a box of cakes for the same flavor.   I never heard too much about this place but in my opinion it's overrated for the prices.   ... on to the next spot...",

The owner was contacted and nice enough to let us have a small sample!!! I've only been here for a couple drinks and a couple samples of our friends food but will certainly be back.",

We enjoyed it so much we took advantage of the Queens Feast AAA special on our way out and bought $200 worth of gift cards for $100. So, we'll be back, Baku!   To the food... We shared the edamame, crispy brussel sprouts, fried calamari, petite nigiri, salmon, skirt steak, pear fortune cookies and chocolate truffles with raspberry coulis. The ONLY dish I didn't love was the salmon but I am admittedly a picky salmon eater. My favorite of the night was the skirt steak, hands down. A big, 8-oz. portion, perfectly cooked and served with a yummy dipping sauce. Runner up was the nigiri -- each piece came topped with something different (a dill cream on the salmon, cilantro on the tuna, etc.) that really highlighted the flavor and freshness of each piece of fish.   The atmosphere was fun! We were in a booth towards the back (near the samurai room -- aka men's bathroom) which allowed for conversation with our friends. The restaurant is dark and has a swanky feel. Glad I decided to wear a dress. Felt like a real night out on the town! But, for only $35.00 per person thanks to Queens Feast! I'm withholding my 5th star until I visit outside of restaurant week and can judge regular menu items and service.",

The sushi rolls, one each for my dinner companion and myself, were served on the same plate. Snow crab and a salmon roll. Again, average. Dessert was a slice of Green tea cheesecake smaller than my cell phone. It came with black sesame ice cream for $9. Overall, not a good experience.",

I've heard great things about this restaurant. I came about 30 minutes earlier than my boyfriend so I sat at the bar on the 2nd floor to grab a drink. Monica has to be one of the most greatest bartenders I've met in awhile. She is very easy to talk to. Once my boyfriend arrived, we were served by Maria. She was an excellent server - very respectful & attentive. For the food, we had quite a few things. I honestly don't remember the names of it all but I do remember getting the Brussels sprouts! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING & highly recommendable. I also got the teriyaki chicken which tasted good but I honestly wish it came with rice. I got the Salmon King roll and it is awesome! The flavors just go so well. We also got the spicy tuna Rice Krispies which was different but good. I recommend Baku and will be here again!",

I mean, I was excited to post content on my IG to share our experience. I've my celebrated birthdays, even planned birthdays and bachelorette dinners there. Once we noticed our friends were not as impressed, it was a disappointment.   Baku to me was not only known for their unique menu, but it was known for the Baku \"experience\".   My last birthday event was December 2015. After my party of 28 were all disappointed in the service.   Last week we decided to give it another chance for our anniversary. The waitress was nice, but food was bland!  My favorite sides were sweet potatoes and grilled corn.  The potatoes were undercooked, corn wasn't seasoned, Sushi was bland, pork belly didn't taste as good as it used to, Kumamoto oysters were a disappointment, (especially after the cost) Shrimp skewers were dry, grilled grouper was slimy... and drinks were not crafted like they used to be.   For a 200.00 meal, we had to pick up more food afterwards at another restaurant.  This was very disappointing.",

We went here for the first time for my husbands birthday because he has been wanting to try it...what a waste! So to start with, the portions were small since you're supposed to share, but the prices were that of a nice restaurant's normal portions. That would have been alright if the food was good, but it was such a let down. Dish after dish was a disappointment. We got desperate and ordered some sushi rolls and even those were eh. Everything was just bland, and the price made it worse. There are just too many amazing restaurants in Charlotte to even bother coming back here- we will not be returning. I will add that the staff was very nice and friendly, though.",

    "text": "The food here is excellent! We have been here many times and usually had great service. The only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because of our recent visit. First, I called to verify my reservation 2 days before to make sure we would be sitting upstairs and they assured me we would. This was going to be my friends first time there, so I wanted them to experience the lounge upstairs. Well, when we arrived, they had a table downstairs for us. So, I kindly reminded the hostess of our reservation for upstairs and she told me there was no more tables up there but she would go check. Well, she came back and said there was a lounge table with some chairs, so we took it. I am not picky, and I love the atmosphere of the lounge area, so I didn't mind. Well, after sitting down and waiting awhile, the bartender came up and asked what we wanted to drink. When we asked questions about drinks, he didn't seem to know the answer and wasn't friendly about it. He barely talked to us-only to take our order. I get it, maybe he was having a bad night. But, to take it out on us, especially a repeat customer and 4 potential new ones-not smart for business! I never received one of my sushi rolls and told him about it but he still charged us for it and made it seem like we were lying. Now, I am sorry, but for as much money we spent, I sure as heck wasn't trying to get a free sushi roll!! I am not trying to knock this place down, but just wanted to share this incident because it was embarrassing to me, after telling my friends how great the place was and service has been and to have this happen was a big let down.",

Example: Ice Bowls for \"2\" is $20.00. This means that each person at your party of \"2\" get 1 piece of sushi, for $20.00. I found it to be ridiculously over priced for what we received. Dessert Bowl: $40.00 for what appeared to be Sara Lee desserts and 3 scoop of ice creams. The atmosphere was good and the A/C was broken or off (90 that night), service was very slow. This was not the servers fault, understaffed was the issue. Again the flavors are excellent atmosphere was good. However for me to return they are going to need a major improvement on the A/C and upgrade the portion size. Total price or our meal with 20% gratuity was over $400.00 for a party of 4. This was with moderate items ordered.",

The food, The Service, The Ambiance, The people (Staff & Customers).. A to Zinc My girlfriend invited me out to check this place out for a late Birthday outing ( my bday was in August) and I informed her that I had this place bookmarked to try and she ensured me that I would not be disappointed. We sat upstairs in the savvy bar area at the actual bar, the bartender was amazing we talked about everything under the sun including the drinks in which I had a Gin Martini with cucumbers which we so refreshing and tasty.  Chef Vince came up and spoke with us and ask what we did and did not like and he would come up with some platters for us and bring them up personally or send them up via a waitress. SCORE  We started with Tore Tar Tare with a quail egg and rice crispy treats on the side (not your snap crackle and pop over sweeten treat, but instead a steady consistent tasty compliment to the Tare Tare). The quail egg to mix with the Toro Tar Tare was AMAZING it switch up the texture and flavor as I ate a couple scoops prior to adding the quail egg and once it was added OOOOO MMMMM Goodness. Next up came the edamame which we had tossed in spicy sweet sauce which was DE-LIC, next up was Grouper Tempura Yes I said GROUPER TEMPURA. There was a method to eating this as it  was suggested by the server to sprinkle some of the crushed salt provided first then add some ginger she finally some of the dipping sauce that was a perfect method and it was OOO so GOOD. We also had a chef Vince creation sushi roll which I'm sure had salmon. For dessert the chef created a fleet of desserts from Mango cake to 5 Flavors of sorbets to fresh fruits ALL were YUMMY.. I can't wait to have DATENIGHT with my husband here as it was an amazing experience and one of my Top5 in Charlotte for sure easily.",

Baku is the best special occasion/ fancy pants dinner spot in town. We've dined downstairs with friends and family -- and found cozy spots upstairs by the bar for a more intimate feel. In my experience, it's best to go with a few people who are down to share, drink, and hang out. On nights that we dine here, Baku is the main event and we've never been disappointed.  Our favorites include: Salmon belly nigiri (the best food ever), Spicy hamachi rice crispy treat, chicken wings (yes, I'm serious), Toro Tar Tare (pricey, but worth it), all of the prawns, wagyu filet, and the black cod. The desserts are pretty good and completely beautiful, but you probably aren't doing Baku right if you still have room for dessert at the end of the meal... just sayin.",

The food was brought out in all different orders and I was eating alone while my wife and others were watching me. They claimed it was because everyone ordered what we did. But the problem with this was every course was the same way.  And to kick this, everything was cold! Had to send it back and even the people serving had no clue where to bring things. They also didn't even tell us what things were. Thank god I was not allergic to tuna or id be in the hospital or worse dead!  Management needs to get fixed here. Before id ever go back again.  The manager attempted to make this \"better\", he wants to give us desert. The desert menu was out of date supposedly and they don't have hot tea. More so, they don't have hot green tea in a Japanese restaurant!  Be warned stay away!",

We got the Rainbow bowl, salmon belly nigiri, spicy hamachi crispy rice roll, wagyu tartar, robata chicken livers and robata pork belly.   The sushi dishes were delicious! Fresh fish and beautiful presentation. The wagyu tartar was over seasoned and was way too salty for our taste. If you have a great piece of wagyu why kill it with all that seasonings?? The robata chicken liver was undercooked and pork belly over cooked. I would come back for the sushi but not robata.",

It was really calm on the first floor and I guess it's where older people like to hangout, so we decided to go to the second floor.   We had 2 different rolls, oisters, salmon and a fillet minion and some drinks. Nothing impressive about the food, it was all about small plates very well decor. Our bill was $200+  I did enjoy my birthday, but not enough to come back for dinner.",

    "text": "John W, our server, was absolutely phenomenal. Since the menu was slightly intimidating, John took his time to walk us through the menu, hinting at what we may or may not enjoy according to our unique palates.   We started the night with a decadent cucumber mint martini which was refreshing after just milling about South Park Mall. The Martini was followed up by the crispy calamari. This calamari was paired with a chipotle mayo sauce and a grilled lemon. The kick of lemons acidic juices added an extra layer of flavor atop the delicately fried, perfectly seasoned, squid pieces. I cannot rave enough about the calamari served here. I find that calamari, if not quality squid, is chewy and rubbery. However, at Baku this was not the case-- the calamari was buttery and smooth, it melted in my mouth.   Next up: the seasonal tempura vegetables. Unlike most tempura, the chefs only fried a thin crust around the various veggies, which complemented the vegetables flavors instead of overpowering them. This dish, akin to the calamari was served with a grilled lemon but instead of a mayo based sauce, it was a miso-soy-herb medley. Absolutely stunning.   We continued onto one of the salads, the roasted eggplant and tomato to be exact. This dish was another piece of art. The dish was a mountain of Japanese eggplant cut into small ovals and roasted to perfection. The seedy consistency of the eggplant was paired with crisp heirloom tomatoes that waited at the bottom of the eggplant mountain, acting as sort of a foundation for the plate. I decided to cross-contaminate here and dipped the eggplants into the miso-herb sauce that came with the vegetable tempura.   Lastly was our sushi-- and boy was it worth the wait. We had an order of Gokujo Tuna and Forbidden. Both were presented beautifully. Forbidden was wrapped with black rice, a nice change of pace from the normal sticky sushi rice. The black rice added an extra crunch to the roll. The gokujo tuna roll had a wonderful underlying heat that amped the flavors up a bit. This heat is reminiscent of a wasabi type heat-- one that comes through your nose and mouth then tapers off slowly. Paired with this heat was the yuzu sauce, a citrusy sauce that truly pulls the plate together.   Overall, Baku was phenomenal. I look forward to coming back.",

I arrived later than intended and she was gracious enough to allow me to have her last tiger prawn. These were shrimp sized prawns to say the least and the smallest prawns I've ever eaten. That being said, the sauce that they come in is heavenly and I used it as my condiment for literally Every dish that was served. Want to take great sushi to the next level? Dip it in tiger prawn sauce. Jidori Chicken too bland and far less impressive than a past visit? Dip it in tiger prawn sauce. Brussel sprouts have too many flakes and taste burnt? Dip it in Tiger Prawn sauce. Calamari was great, but you guessed it. I dipped it in tiger prawn sauce as well just because.  Service was excellent. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu, and even gave us the background on how each food was prepared. Did you know the 20% over pricing at Baku is because they cook with organic charcoal flown from Japan? I cannot make this stuff up. Major polite smirk. The thought of someone labeling charcoal as organic cracks me up. That's where we are as a society.  I'd give a 3.5 if it was an option. Nevertheless, it is not and I'm rounding down because of the chicken and Brussel's sprouts. I'll be back sooner than later.",

It's located right across the street from Southpark Mall next door to the \"ski slope\" church.  I will preface this review with the fact that I'm not really into sushi.  My table ordered a special sushi dinner that was multiple courses and was not on the menu.  I didn't try many of the dishes. I will write about what I did try and rate it accordingly.  I ordered the skirt steak based on others reviews on Yelp. Thanks yelpers! It was fantastic! So juicy and tender. I'd go back just for the skirt steak.  The high light of the night was the Wagyu meat! It was amazing.  For $25/oz it better be though. It literally melts in your mouth it is so fantastic.  It was a special treat for the birthday party celebration. Not something I would order myself because of the high price tag.  Every plate that came out was presented beautifully and you could tell the chefs had taken a lot of time to display the food.  I had a great time with my friends but I don't know if I will be back here because of the steep price tag. Maybe I will check them out during restaurant week.   They do have a large bar upstairs and valet parking out front.",

I did without my entree just to try the homemade key lime and citrus cream pie. My husband doesn't eat desserts but wolfed half of mine!

But Yelp doesn't give me the option of doing half stars so I'm gonna go with three.   We did girls night here and we each did the restaurant week menu. Now when we sat down, the server said he recommends that everyone get two dishes and it's meant to share. Let me tell you, I'm not sure who is sharing these dishes because the serving size is small. There was a woman next to us who was served her brussel sprouts when I got there. She dramatically said \"oh my goodness! It's so much food! I won't be able to finish this!\" I looked over to see no more than 7 cut up brussel sprouts on her plate. *insert eye roll here* Let me tell you, my girl friends and I all were easily able to eat every item (and we each ordered three separate dishes/courses - no sharing here).   I started with the brussel sprouts and they were wonderful! They had tons of flavor and the texture was amazing. My next course was the dumplings. I loved the flavor and they were crispy on the outside. I also really liked the green onion and peppers on the side that I tossed into the ponzu sauce. For the third course, I had the salmon and, after squeezing the lemon on it, really liked it.   My friend was still hungry and ordered the chocolate cake and said it tasted like a little Debbie cake and wasn't worth the price.   Had this place been more reasonably priced, I would've definitely given it four stars but give the portion size and price point, I think three stars is reasonable.",

Upstairs was pretty empty too, only 4 people were using dinner when we got there. Then when we started our entree, there are a 4-people party came, and they were seated right next to us, REALLY?! There are so many other tables out there and they have to seat them right next to us?   When we finished entree, one of our appetizer didn't come, we reminded waitress she told us it would come soon. 10 mins later, we were still waiting and have to listen to our loud neighbor's table(to be fair they are not that loud but 4 people talking right next to you, and you can clearly hear their conversation). So we told waitress we are leaving, we don't want to wait for the dish they forgot to cook. No apologizes from the restaurant.  Waitress said she took the dish off the bill and she made it sound she did us a favor.",

Atmosphere:  Cool, eclectic vibe. Host, bussers, and waiters were very attentive and personable.   Food Must-Haves:  -Chili-glazed edamame. My mouth waters just typing about it - it was seriously SO good. Do it. -Brussels sprouts were also delicious.  -Potstickers are also a very solid choice. Ours were piping hot and the dipping sauce was very tasty.  -Robata Grilled Atlantic Salmon (entree) was seriously one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had.  -Green Tea Creme Brulee (because it's creme brulee...duh)  So-So items: -Spicy Himachi Rice Krispie Treat (appetizer)... didn't taste like much, and definitely NOT spicy (bummer). Nothing to write home about. -USDA Prime NY Strip... pretty fatty, came out in thin strips. Again, nothing to write home about.   Overall, we'll be back, Restaurant Week or not!",

Let me say that Baku is probably one of my favorite expensive night out places (and to be honest we thought it was going to be more expensive than it was).   Service was phenomenal!! The hostesses wished us a happy anniversary, our waiter was awesome and surprisingly the same one we had on our first visit, and the management was so thoughtful in giving us a dessert platter on the house for our anniversary. Seriously they were truly amazing and made our evening :)  The food well, we had a combination of things we had tried before and things we didn't try before. The pork belly was to die for!! Seriously I'll never skip that one again lol. Also another new dish we tried was the Hamachi rice crispie treat which was also delicious!! We ordered probably around 8 dishes to share and we were beyond stuffed (needed a doggy bag). However obviously we didn't pass on dessert!!   The cocktails were just as amazing as we remembered... the pear one and the oriental apple are my two favs!! I know a lot of people complain about price versus portions and I can see where they are coming from however we find it completely worth it!! The quality speaks for itself.  Only ehhh item we got was the sweet corn. It was on the cob mini style and it came out cold and had too much oil. It wasn't bad  but we wouldn't order it again.",

We were told there was a wait and my husband was hungry so we got seated inside immediately.   I was told wine pours were small, so we both opted for a cocktail. My husband got a gin & cucumber concoction which he thought was kind of like lemonade. I got a wild tea vodka & cucumber drink. It was a little sweeter than I prefer but glad I tried it!  Now to the menu . . . our waitress, Morgan, was very thorough in explaining the style of the restaurant. She suggested an item from each page, but that seemed like a lot. But I guess in the end we probably ordered that much!   We started with the calamari which was delicious! Lightly crispy and delicate! We decided on two sushi rolls. Spicy tuna - yum! - and Forbidden Rice roll which had white asparagus. It was unique and tasty! For our next round, I asked about the baby artichoke skewers which Morgan highly recommended, as well as the rice bowls. My husband wasn't up for either, so we focused on entrees. We ordered Grilled Branzini b/c we'd never had it. It was 2 small slices of grilled fish (not much flavor!!) and a tomato salad. Very small portion and disappointing flavor for $24!! Since our waitress asked about it, my husband told her it was just ok and didn't have a lot of flavor. When she brought the bill, she informed us she took the Branzini off the tab! We greatly appreciated that!  All in all, it was good but not a great experience and not worth the $65 (total without the entree). I'd go back but not anytime soon.",

This month we had the pleasure of trying out Baku, which is centrally located on Sharon Rd. across from South Park Mall.   Un-freaking-believable!!! There was something for everyone, I'm not kidding!! We decided to start with a few sushi and sashimi dishes to share while we discussed wine and sake options with our server, whom I might add was charming, accommodating, friendly, and overall extremely helpful and patient with all of our questions. He picked out a few bottles of sake for our table to share based on listening to our likes and dislikes, delicious!   Next, we decided to continue our experience with some skewers (the pork belly are to die for) and some small bites (2 words: roasted oysters). As new food came, so did new plates, the staff definitely made us feel as if they too, wanted us to have an amazing experience. We tried everything! We ended our meal with surf and turf and vegetable courses, including the spicy filet, lamb chops, duck, Madagascar prawn (you have to see this thing!), black cod, salmon, grilled baby artichokes, and portobello mushrooms.   We were so stuffed after trying so many delicious items, we almost passed on dessert.... J/k!! We decided to share the creme brulee, mango toffee cake, and assorted sorbets. Holy cow!!!!   From the decor and ambiance, to the attentiveness and outstanding service, I know I'll be back and I know we will also be back for more \"Girls' Nights\" in the near future. This may just be my new favorite restaurant!!",

It's a terrible attempt at upselling.   We had the pork belly skewers, blue fin tuna maki roll, king crab leg & salmon roll, tempura veggies, tenderloin and asparagus skewers, pork dumplings, tofu, edamame, etc. We had a wide range of dishes and overall they were all just good, but not exceptional and certainly not memorable.

The wait staff is well trained. They really explain the dishes well and try to sell them to you. The usual stuff like..'oh great selection.. So jealous you are eating it' etc. I liked the service since they try pretty hard.  They have a fair amount of veg dishes which is good since I am vegetarian. The forbidden rice sushi looked amazing and tasted better than any other veg  wrapped sushi I have ever had. The tempura veg was ordinary. The mushroom rice pot was presented and sold to me by the waiter and it tasted quite good. Like a Japanese risotto. The Brussels sprouts were awful!   I was expecting the place to blow my mind based on the menu prices. It didn't . It would have gotten five stars if the food lived up to the price. My significant other ordered meat dishes, she was not that impressed either.",

    "text": "Had a really interesting experience here tonight - could have been a real disaster, but the restaurant management did exactly the right thing and it made every bit of difference.    Went out for dinner with my daughter - special occasion while she was home for the weekend.  We'd been here once before and really liked it, although it is not cheap.  Tonight, the food was terrific.  We had the pork dumplings, which we were perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned - terrific.  From there we had the lobster and avocado (sushi) roll.  That was okay, but I never tasted any lobster in it.  Went on to the spicy filet mignon with the mushroom pot and rice.  This thing is a madman - spectacularly tasty and just perfect with the beef and mushrooms.  Did the pork belly skewers which were great with some kimchee and some other stuff that was all terrific.  Food was perfectly prepared, service was great!  So now the problem ...  We were seated at a nice table towards the back of the restaurant.  Behind our table, however, was a booth of four guys in their 40s who were doing some serious drinking.  They were loud from the moment we got there, but as time went on, they became more and more animated.  Their language was disgusting - loaded with f-bombs shouted at the top of their lungs.  I was embarrassed for them, but the longer it went on, the angrier I got.  Long story short, we cut dinner short and let our server know that we needed to get the hell out of there.  She was extremely apologetic - knew exactly what was going on - and got us our check quickly.  The manager came over and apologized again.  He also let us know that he had taken about a third of our check off (much appreciated) and he gave us a $25 gift card for another visit.  In short I think Baku handled this situation just about as well as anyone could have hoped.  We appreciated it and we'll be back.",

    "text": "Baku was recommended to us by a bartender at one of our favorite restaurants. There was a high expectation before we even got there... I'm sure you know where I am going with this. The ambience was nothing special, reminded me of the inside of a Pier 1. The service was good, I can't take that away from them, but very robotic.  Every server had a long spiel about the menu, our server actually walked us through the whole menu. We can actually read and naming almost every dish was misleading- he should have only highlighted the best or best selling. The cocktails were nice, Pimm's cup and Cuba Libre.  As the food starting coming out family style things started to go pear shaped. Chicken livers, no, don't do it. Pork dumplings, good, but basic. The sushi was the highlight. We had a signature eel roll with sweet potatoes (off of the specials list). And a salmon belly nigiri with some sort of glaze. Honestly I wish I could name them but I was so distracted by the amount of food that we ordered and did not enjoy. Corn on the cob, was too charred on the grill for my liking. The robata duck with melon was good, and a generous portion. Butterfish sashimi was another fail for us.  Did I mention the fruit flies that swarmed around us the entire time?  When I got the check it was insult to injury. $$$ should be more like $$$$. I was still hungry!",

The service was great and the food was pleasant. We had the calamari (which by far has been the best we've ever had), smoked salmon nigiri, soft shell crab roll and the 55 oz Australian tomahawk steak. We kinda knew what we wanted before hand which I think that is what made our service go pretty well. Our server had no problem with bringing our food out on time. There are a few things I didn't like which was the music (a little to loud), and the plain rice we ordered was really mushy and tasted like water the texture was horrible the kimchi was very salty as well. All in all this place is very nice and I do consider coming back soon",

Being across from the mall you would have expected this place to be packed. Maybe that should have been my sign.  There were only 3 customers.  A lady at the bar, me, and my honey.  We were seated and it took 5 mins before the waiter came over.  The server was nice enough.  The only thing more plentiful than customers were nats!  We kept having to swat our food and drinks.  Geez. We ordered 2 miso soups(red and traditional ) and 2 apps(baked oysters and seared tuna). My honey usually has no strong reactions to food but we agreed...horrible. Oysters fishy and not fresh - i almost resorted to spitting the one I ate in my napkin.  Seared tuna was absolutely tasteless. The soups were ok. We decided to leave after a disappointing start and fighting nats in hopes of salvaging our night out.  Maybe it was just an off night for Baku- but bad enough for me to have no desire to return.",

    "text": "I had very high expectations for an authentic and original concept to come to Charlotte and shake up the food scene in the South Park area. My expectation's were met with much disappointment. While everything was not terribly horrible, the restaurant was an oddity, the atmosphere felt confused and awkward, and the service was-HORRIBLE.  We were greeted by the general manager opening the door, which was nice, but the hostess sat us at a horrible table, when there was literally no one else in the restaurant. With multiple seating options it felt a little ridiculous to be sitting at the first tiny two top against a wall-which just felt unwelcoming. With booths available you think you would want to make your guests comfortable.   The server was the master of up-selling, he brought us out a $6 bottle of Fiji water-and without even presenting it he opened it up and proceeded to poor. Where is the tap water, the other tables had it? He asked if we wanted sparkling water or still water-thought this was synonymous with tap water??He also insisted on \"guiding\" us through the \"dinner experience\"-like I cant order and read for myself. After an odd monologue about Baku-he moved us across the dining room so we would be more \"comfortable.\" That was kind of awkward but I was glad to have a better table.   Food- The calamari was amazing. The calamari was tender, served hot and fresh, with the perfect amount of seasoning, it came with sliced green chillis that added a nice kick of flavor. A little oily but this didn't distract me from enjoying it. 10/10  It went downhill from there-  Scallops with foi gras- Ok, they were amazing as well, but we waited 15 minutes between finishing the calamari and receiving the scallop. I say scallop because it was one scallop cut in half- you think you'd receive more for 19 dollars? It had a nice flavor but the foi gras was not substantial and by the time it got to the table it had melted away, also hard to cut with chopsticks. 6/10  Chicken Skewers with leeks- Ok- came out hot, had a nice smoky flavor from the grill-right amount of sauce, but where were the leeks? It looked like green scallions were substituted for leeks, and this didn't lend the same amount of  appeal and flavor you would experience with actual leeks. 4/10  Duck breast Entree- Nicely rendered piece of duck, cooked properly, it had a smoky flavor and it was nicely done. It lacked seasoning and a sauce. It came with a small dish of chopped plum chunks-which added a nice sweetness but lacked the body of a sauce and didn't adhere to the duck because it was hard and awkward to eat with chopsticks.. This could have been an amazing dish if it had been served with a sauce and hadn't been so difficult to eat. 7/10  -May I mention that our server suggested we order a vegetable to \"cleanse our palet.\"  So I assume this means before the meat course/main entree? We literally waited for 20 minutes after we finished the duck entree for corn on the cob. By this point the meal had ended- and waiting 20 minutes for corn felt silly. Also no one came by our table to ask if we were ok- the server literally disappeared  When he brought it out he had the audacity to say it eats like desert- by that point we just wanted a check and a box for the corn.   Overall-Weird experience. The music was horrible as well-felt like I was at a graduation party. The ambiance felt confused and unestablished.Food was good, but the courses were improperly timed, dishes could have used a little bit of seasoning or at least the server should offer salt and pepper. Service was non-exsistant for most of the experience, the server was nice and \"attentive\" at first but after he took our orders he spent most of his time doing side work making us feel abandoned and awkward- the restaurant was pretty much empty- you think you'd be a little more attentive. The service and experience could have been better-especially since the South Park area has a decent amount of competition for a new restaurant. They need to step it up if they want to survive.   Wouldnt go back. Overall- 5-10  Not worth the price :(",

Located in an older building across from the South Park mall, the overall impression inside is intimate and sophisticated. Great for a date night or going out with friends after work.  We order a cross section of small plates, including sushi as well as their specialty, grilled meats. Everything was spectacular, from the delicately assembled sushi (including an incredible butterfish with a citrus glaze) to the high-heat grilled items, in particular the scallops and the beef tenderloin. On a related note, if you are a chicken liver fan, you must get their skewered livers, probably the best I've ever had! The ingredients are all top-notch and the subtle flavor combinations are genuinely unique.   Service was very good - intelligent, well-timed and not pushy.  This place belongs on your top-5 Charlotte list!",

We were here last Thursday night at the suggestion of other yelpers - Thanks guys!!!  They had valet parking right out front in case you didn't want to try to hunt down a spot.  There is an upstairs and a downstairs where you can be seated.  Downstairs has the excitement of the open kitchen and very nice decor.  Upstairs is a little sexier with a bar, lounge areas, high tops and low tables.  We were told to get a few small plates so we ended up with the pork dumplings (seared slightly on the bottom - comes with the house sauce - DIVINE), the peppers (I can't remember the name?!?!), tenderloin and asparagus skewers, pork belly skewers, and shrimp tempura.  Each dish was delectable, not too smoky.  Just the right amount of food for two people.  The wait staff was super attentive (although struggling with the restaurant's newness still....)  The decor and music - so sexy chic.  The hot towel service was a great touch.  I can't wait to go back and try new items.  Superb experience and truly a unique Charlotte dining experience.",

    "text": "Kitchen service and management alone should keep you far away from paying $32.00 for a piece of Cod a la carte. The food is good but good is not enough for this type of restaurant and menu. We ordered multiple appetizers to share along with 3 separate entrees and side dishes. We were a table of 3, ordered our drinks and only one arrived with the excuse of, \"the bar is backed up.\" There were very few tables filled since it was early, clearly the bar was not overflowing. Our appetizers came out one by one in a timely fashion.  First to the table was one of the side dishes to our entrees, sweet potatoes. They say there for 10 minutes before an entree arrived. We of course sent them back. Then came one entree, black Cod, $32.00 a la carte. 10 minutes later the second Black Cod arrived, our third person was still sitting with nothing. We finally asked for the manager. We got a a ridiculous excuse of, \"this is a tapas style restaurant your waiter should've explained that to you. I said he didn't have to we've eaten here multiple times before and since we dine all over the country and Europe we can read a menu. It is clearly separated appetizers/entrees/side dishes. In the mean time, while he is arguing his point, our two of three entrees (no side dishes) are still sitting on the table for over 20 minutes.  The ending is our server at least gave us enough respect to acknowledge that our food was poorly timed by the kitchen and they were having problems with service. This alone was the only redeeming quality of ruining my son's birthday dinner. We will NOT be back again.",

Presentation is huge, here, and I think that is a lot of what you pay for.   Our experience was marred by two unfortunate happenings:   1)  I got shot down 4 times when asking for drinks. Notably, on 2 different sakes that were on the menu or on display at the bar. This isn't a big huge deal, as I understand that they want to craft an experience... but I'm used to \"point and get\" at a restaurant.  2) There is a serious problem with their oyster supply system. Each time i have gone I've been served inedible oysters. The first time I ate four and one was horrifying, the second time I ate three and I had to spit out one, and another I swallowed but was not acceptable.  Also, the water tasted like crap (which I wonder about whether this is related to some of the other small problems).   All in all, it's outstanding food preparation that is crippled by fundamentals. There is a lot of potential in this restaurant if they can fix some of this stuff.",

The food was fantastic, the pork belly melts in your mouth and the shrimp tempura was divine.

The pork dumplings were tender and flavorful and the rock shrimp tempura were perfectly seasoned and piping hot when the arrived at our table- the perfect way to start our meal. Next we tried the butterfish which was unlike anything I've ever tasted- the butterfish, white asparagus and sauce came together and were nothing short of magic. The spicy filet of beef was cooked perfectly and so tender that I was easily able to eat it with my chop sticks, and the sauce was heavenly. Then we enjoyed the largest king crab leg I have ever seen, with sweet local corn and baby artichokes.  Please do not leave this restaurant without having dessert, we tried the dark chocolate espresso truffles with sour cherry sauce and cinnamon/ginger snap ice cream-  i could eat that dessert everyday for the rest of my life and never tire of it.

We poured our own wine all night, and sat with empty plates for 15 minutes before we asked for our check. Our server apologized for the lack of service and hospitality and offered to buy us a drink at the lounge upstairs & the bartender did take great care of us. I would have given Baku 4 or 5 stars but the lack of service brought it down. The restaurant would be great with just an improvement in service and hospitality.",

It was a bit of a turn off when you walked into the front of the restaurant and the management and possible owners were huddled by the front door - not to greet you, but just being tense.  We ordered white and red miso soups, which were handed to us backwards; which was annoying because we had to listen to a 3 minute speech on each food option on the menu. I get it, your a new place in town, but I can read. The beef tenderloin with asparagus was good, as was the Kurobuta pork and sweet onion dumplings.  I can't say the food was any more flavorful than say Cowfish. The front patio was nicely decorated and had a fun atmosphere. I wish they had some music piping through the outdoor seating area.",

    "text": "Holy crap Charlotte.... Baku is here. We got into the Pre-Grand Opening event last night and it didn't take long at all for us to fall hardcore in love with Charlotte's only Robata Grill. Chef Michael Shortino and chef Anoosh Shariat have introduced Robata style Japanese cooking to the Queen City with the creation of Baku in Southpark and we were on hand to check out their creation. Robata is a style of grill cooking designed centuries ago that burn a specially sourced smokeless charcoal at over 800 degrees and gives its food a faint but distinct smoky flavor.  We haven't been this excited about a restaurant since the first time we checked out Chima in Uptown. The buildings unappealing exterior is is nowhere near as impressive as its interior decor. The menu features items sourced from local Carolina growers, Robata Meats, Seafood and Vegetables, Skewers, Tempura, Maki Rolls, Sushi/Sashimi, and Desserts. We were instructed to order between 3 - 4 plates each and try to sample various things from across the whole menu. We happily obliged and ordered the:  - Kurobuta Pork and Sweet Onion Dumplings - Assorted Fresh Vegetable Tempura with Tentsuyu Dipping Sauce - Sake Glazed Chicken Wings with Lime and Sancho Salt Flake - Marinated Lamb with Korean Chili and Garlic - Spicy Filet of Beef with Black Pepper Sesame Sauce - Beef Tenderloin and Asparagus Skewers - Sweet Potatoes with Honey and Cinnamon - Local Sweet Corn with Shiso Butter - Baby Back Ribs with Star Anise, Cinnamon, Sweet Chili Glaze and Cashews - Espresso Frangelico Truffles on Almond Florentine with Cinnamon Gingersnap Ice Cream and a Sour Cherry Sauce with Fresh Blackberries.  As a personal challenge to myself I decided I was going to eat everything we ordered with the chopsticks that were provided or my fingers when appropriate... that means absolutely no spoons, forks, or knives. Everything we ate fell in a range between simply delicious to truly mind blowing. The Kurobuta Pork and Sweet Onion Dumplings were soft, juicy, and an easy target for my chopsticks. The Assorted Fresh Vegetable Tempura with Tentsuyu Dipping Sauce was delicious, crunchy (especially the eggplant), and once again an easy target for my chopsticks. The Sake Glazed Chicken Wings with Lime and Sancho Salt Flake were the juiciest pieces of chicken I had ever sank my teeth into, they had a very faint grill flavor from the robata grill, and were an easy target for eating with my fingers. The Marinated Lamb with Korean Chili and Garlic was juicy and with its giant bone was easy to eat with my fingers.  The Spicy Filet of Beef with Black Pepper Sesame Sauce was the real robata star of the night. The beef was both tender and addictive, and gone in seconds via my chopsticks. The Beef Tenderloin and Asparagus Skewers were an unexpected surprise (we didn't order them) and we decided to eat them up before anyone realized the mistake :) The Sweet Potatoes with Honey and Cinnamon were incredibly soft with a faint hint of cinnamon and easy pickings for my chopsticks. My only complaint with the sweet potatoes were that they came with the skin on and when I tried to take a bite of them the skin came completely off and smacked me in the chin :( The Local Sweet Corn with Shiso Butter was crisp, sweet, lightly grilled, and my fingers made easy work of them. The Baby Back Ribs with Star Anise, Cinnamon, Sweet Chili Glaze and Cashews came out a little later than expected but well worth the wait.  For us the best part of the night is always dessert and for our dessert we had the Espresso Frangelico Truffles on Almond Florentine with Cinnamon Gingersnap Ice Cream and a Sour Cherry Sauce with Fresh Blackberries. The presentation was probably the most unique for a dessert we have ever come across. The ice cream was sitting on a block of ice, everything was resting in a bowl of ice, the espresso frangelico truffles were a dark chocolate lovers dream, the almond florentine was incredible, and I really wanted to drink the sour cherry sauce by itself. Dessert really put my chopstick skills to the test but I crushed it. The truffles were easy pickings, the almond florentine went down without a fight, and the ice cream proved to be a little difficult but with a steady hand I made it happen :)  Baku blew us away and is easily one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. The robata style cooking is unique, the menu is diverse, and the desserts are top notch. If you're bored with your normal Friday night restaurant check out Baku at Southpark and make sure you don't leave before getting dessert :)",

Always get the crispy rice with spicy tuna on top, and the tuna tartare with taro root chips hit da spot.  The king crab legs make you feel like a Kween and the pork dumplings are everything u want in a dumpling.  Love yourself and come here with cash to blow, fun people and a free spirit.  While you're having a good time with ur crew, food will be poppin up at your table as its ready.  Once one dish is chowed down, the next one is on the way.  Keep dat lineup rollin",

Great service even though we had to wait for food. I would suggest reservations because the kitchen was backed up that night.",

Definitely the only place I've ever been to where you can order raw quail egg shooters and saki made from ancient Asian igloos. But it's not cheap. A great place to go for a special occasion or just to try some very cool stuff. Facilities are well appointed and clean. Everything I tasted was very good and presented well. Staff was friendly and service was good. For the money I'd probably go somewhere else. We got three rolls and some edamame with two waters which came out to sixty bucks before tip. So yeah is it good? Yes. Is it worth the money that you spend? Probably not.",

However, that must be down in advance to bring it out and sit at the right temperature before cooking it. So that was a little disappointing not knowing that before hand. So we just stuck with the Queens Feast menu. The food wasn't bad but wasn't to die for either. I'd say it was just something different to try. The place itself is nice and the staff were all friendly and willing to take the time out to tell us about their place.",

My side of the table ordered a bunch of things to split. Shout out to Yelpers who post pics. We definitely nailed our order because of Yelp photos. The skirt steak and spicy hamachi crispy treat were the two main stars and standouts. Pork belly skewers were also delicious. We also got a couple sushi rolls, fried chicken, rock shrimp tempura, spicy edamame, and shishito peppers. All great. I tried bites of both the spicy filet and the strip, the skirt steak beat both of them.   For a large group, our two servers did a fantastic job. My service is always great. I recommend making a reservation beforehand. Note: half price wine on Mondays.  I will say that Baku is kind of pricey for what it is, but I still come back.

In interim, a waiter from another section asked if he could take our drink menu. We never saw it again.   When finally ordering food, very first fish order was \"no longer available...should have been taken off menu\". Ordered a mixture of sushi, edamame, and entrees. Sushi came out immediately. Edamame took 30 minutes and asking twice. Entrees came out a few minutes later. Second drink order took almost 20 minutes for delivery.   In summary, food is good. Service is awful.

Walking in the ambiance is so perfect.  It's romantic and quiet which makes for a nice evening meal.  We arrived about 10 minutes early and were seated immediately.  I always love when restaurants do that!  We ordered some drinks and then placed our order off of the restaurant week menu.  I got the edamame, pork dumplings, NY strip, and split the chocolate cake and beignets for dessert.  I was a little disappointed that dessert was $5 extra on the restaurant week menu, but both desserts were so good I wanted to lick the plate   Let me say that all of my courses were incredible.  I loved everything!  The portions were enough to fill me up and I ate every last thing on my plate.  The reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the kitchen was very backed up.  It took forever to get each course.  Our waitress was apologetic and kept our drinks full though!",

    "text": "Came here for my dad's birthday dinner and was very interested in trying Baku. I have read several reviews and seen plenty of pictures of this restaurant especially when it first opened but it seemed like the hype died down recently.  I made reservations last minute in fear it might be busy on a Friday evening but I had no trouble making reservations on the way to the restaurant. When we arrived I realized I probably did not even need the reservations, there was not a wait and not many people in the restaurant We were immediately taken upstairs to the a dining area. I did like the decor and lounge feel of the restaurant.  Our waiter was very prompt and helpful. Unfortunately he told us that they are in the process of changing the menu so a lot of the menu items are no longer available, ie a lot of the items I saw on Yelp. Because the menu is tapas style we just started ordering everything that sounded good to us.  Pork wontons: these were ok, they were good size and plenty to share among the 3 of us. Brussels sprouts: my favorite item, they were crispy but also a little sweet with a sweet soy sauce drizzled. Pork Belly: good size pork belly but not cooked crispy enough for me, a little too fatty. Dragon Roll: I enjoyed the dragon roll, because my mom is allergic to avocado we had to sub for extra eel which caused them to up-charge us but we all still enjoyed the roll Sea Bass: My dad ordered the sea bass and I did not try it but he said it was ok but which it was cook a little crispier.  Beignets: beignets were not the normal beignets but there were a nice dessert to share after dinner. The ice cream that is on top tasted more of a whipped frosting or something more than ice cream.   Overall Baku is a nice restaurant and the atmosphere makes it a nice place for a low key dinner. I would be interested in seeing the new menu.",

We were told that the whole table had to order off the queens feast menu or all order off the regular menu which I guess makes sense for timing courses. However, our food came out at different times where one person was served their first 2 courses before any of us got any food or someone got their 2nd course before their 1st, etc. I'm very disappointed in the food this time around. It was all bland, something I could've easily made tastier at home. I compared it to pictures from the 1st Queens Feast I went to where we got the exact same order and not only was there no taste but also  no visual appeal. The sushi rolls that we ordered on top of the Queen's feast menu were also meh. The only item I enjoyed on the menu was the spicy hamachi rice crispy treat.",

They never admitted the server either didn't put our order in or she gave it to someone else by accident. Finally an hour later we received our roll (that didn't require rice as it was made with cucumber instead) the food was great but he cautioned by the service",

We went during restaurant week and were SO excited but everything from our server, who was clearly on drugs, to the two dishes I sent back ( I can not remember the last time I sent food back, let alone 2 dishes) was frustrating and unsatisfying. We left hungry.  When we asked the server if the calamari was rings or steak, he couldn't even find words to describe it, he showed us his fingers and said it looked like that but in half and round, if you're curious, the calamari was steak. Getting an answer to anything we asked from him was basically impossible because I dont think he could understand what we were saying, he was so strung out.   At the end of the experience, we spent 100 bucks on bad service, a combo of good, mediocre and terrible food and a cautionary tale.  I am giving 2 stars because the calamari and rice crispy treat were pretty good.",

I have to say, I wasn't expecting a meal this great.  It was fantastic. From the moment we sat down, the experience was wonderful. Our waiter was that perfect blend of knowledgable, funny, and wry. We knew we were in good hands.   The plates are small and meant to be shared, so we ordered three plates (two rolls and dumplings - all amazing), then asked him to bring us two of his favorites - even better!  It really was a perfect evening of food and wine, each course better than the last. I cannot recommend Baku strongly enough. If I lived in Charlotte, it would be tops on my list.   I hope you go. I know you'll enjoy.",

We didn't really order a lot of food, we wanted to have a couple of drinks and eat light, so we ordered the snow crab (maki roll) and rock shrimp tempura appetizer.  The appetizer came out first, and it was very good, but I told the waiter it was suppose to come along with the sushi! It took 45 mins for the one sushi roll to come out, but it was amazingly good when we finally got it! They actually gave us an extra appetizer to make up for the mistake, which was very nice! The second time we went in for dinner, we actually was seated downstairs, but moved upstairs because the vibe is better (our opinion.) We ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, Baku lobster roll, and the snow crab roll again. The Chilean Sea Bass was a small portion, but well worth it because it was amazing, and both of the rolls were as well! I would definitely recommend giving Baku a try, the service, drinks, and food are amazing!",

    "text": "Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant. My SO and I went for the first time during Queen's Feast, and despite the crowd, the service was phenomenal. We were about 30 minutes early for our reservation, which the staff wasn't able to find, so we went to the bar for a drink while we waited for our table. Despite not being able to find our OpenTable reservation for 8:30 and the restaurant being at capacity, the staff handled the situation exceptionally well and we were seated at a table at 8:30 with no problem. Service in the bar was a little slow while we waited for our table, but the bar was standing room only, so that may have contributed to the slow service. There was a live DJ in the bar, which my SO and I really enjoyed. After being moved to our table we had a wonderful server and bar drinks came much faster. We had 6 different dishes, which was a perfect amount for the 2 of us. If we went back, I think 4-5 would be plenty though. While all of the food was good, there were some definite stand outs. The sweet chili edamame was one of my favorites, as were the rice krispy treats. My only complaint was that my salmon was probably closer to medium well than medium, but it was still tasty. My two biggest complaints were that they only had 1 restroom stall for the ladies' room, which created a line at times. And it was unbelievably hot inside the restaurant - this may have been due to the number of people, but other yelpers lead me to believe this might be an ongoing problem. Overall, I was very happy with our experience at Baku and the SO and I would certainly go back! I do strongly recommend making a reservation, as table space is limited and it's a popular spot.",

I ordered the Hidden Hibiscus cocktail and it was bubbly & refreshing. The music was audible but wasn't too loud that we could not hear ourselves speak. We were unaware that the menu was Japanese 'tapas' style, but our server gave us a long rehearsed speech about the menu and restaurant style.   The Queen's Feast selections were described well on the menu but the portions were rather small. The spicy chili edamame was great, but edamame isn't hard to mess up. I ordered a type of maki roll with yellowtail; it came out in 4 tiny pieces. The tiger prawn & vegetable tempura consisted of 2 skinny tiger prawns, a 1/4 of a mushroom, 2 asparagus stalks and a piece of eggplant. Quite disappointing.   I am glad we went here for the reduced price during Queen's Feast as opposed to paying triple the price on a regular night. I wouldn't rush back here again.",

They were 'open' but still a lot of folks prepping and stuff. If you're gonna open at 4, be ready and set up then or open at 5 instead. Bartender upstairs was super nice and chatty, while he was drinking his coffee. He made some recommendations for me to have for dinner. See them below... While I was sitting there the bar manager (I'm assuming) was taking inventory, while they were 'open'. He was in the bar area for almost 30 minutes while I sat there and didn't even acknowledge my existence or try to make conversation, although he had no trouble joking and talking socially to the bartender...it was pretty sad that someone in a management position at a restaurant missed a chance to make a connection with a customer and make them feel welcome to the establishment instead of being cold. Almost felt like arrogance...anyways, I digress.  On to the food: Pork belly - too much sauce on the cubes but the kimchi and flavors were delish Tiger prawns - decent but just a little tough, maybe over cooked, sauce was good though Brussels sprouts - good Kumomoto oysters - always my fav of the oyster family, but the sauce totally destroyed the usually flavorful oysters (Since the pork belly wasn't 'all that' for me, the nice bartender took them off)  Bottom line, not impressed and I doubt I will revisit the restaurant anytime soon.",

However we were advised to try the chefs tasting (forgive me I dk what it was called) it was listed on the menu as $100. It was $100 a person which was well over priced and was not specified by the waiter. For $300 we were underwhelmed by charcoal and teriyaki flavored every thing. Go somewhere else in the South Park area. Much better options within one mile.",

Our party was upstairs and I was able to get a small drink prior,  House sangria. It was average. They said they added Sprite normally to the drink,  which to wasn't the best idea.   Food overall was really good. Small plates, but all 3 courses were delicious.  For apps,  I had Pork Belly, main course, steak with Wasabi sauce, and dessert, Creme Brule.  Each course was better than the last and surprisingly filling.   A bonus to me is that it's smack dab in the center of 2 bank locations in Southpark. So weekend dining, you always have a parking spot. Not really much congestion.   Only con, I could give is that I wish there were bigger plates with more food!",

    "text": "My husband and I came here last night for a 8:15 reservation for Charlotte Restaurant Week. Just to start off, I would give the food 5 stars, atmosphere 3 stars, and service 5 stars.   We were seated immediately upstairs (right beside a group of stupid loud drunk business men. I mean holy bejesus, i dont know what these guys were drinking but I want one of those!....my husband actually moved around and sat beside me on the couch so I could hear him. This actually worked out better cause we enjoyed our meal chatting and sitting right next to each other cuddling on a comfy couch. I recommend it!) and the waiter came over to do a walk through of the menu and \"how they do things\". This place is True tapas style through and through and I think to enjoy the experience, you have to know that coming in. They bring dishes out as they are ready and it's more of a food experience then meal. (Aka, great for a date like us but probably not the easist for a a group of people trying to just grab dinner). The one thing that irked me some was that he asked if we wanted sparkling or bottled water. Luckily my husband caught of an just requested tap so we werent charged a crap ton for agua. I mean, come on, tap is literally the same thing as bottled and I didnt like that the waiter was kinda deceiving people by only offering those two options. Anyways, I digress.   We ordered a bottle of J Lohr Petit Sirah, which was absolutely amazing! We have actually been to that winery in California and can attest that the bottle price was marked up a fair bit though. Oh well, what can you do about it.   We decided to do the Restaurant Week menu and got the following things (they came out in this order): -Spicy tuna sushi- This roll was so simple but it was really really good. I felt like they used quality sushi in it. It came with 8 pieces, so perfect to split. -Pork Belly with Kimchi- The pork belly came out on two skewers (3 pieces on each). Once again, great for splitting for two. You really could taste the grilled flavor on it and the kimchi was a perfect additive. Second best pork belly I have had in Charlotte! (Soul will alway be numero uno) -Flank Steak- This was the highlight of the night! The steak was cooked perfectly and the dipping sauce with it was amazing. It also came with two sweet potato pieces.....tasted just like sweet potato casserole! Yum. The portion was pretty well sized I thought for tapas -Salmon- The salmon was good but I think we would have enjoyed it more if it came out before the steak cause I think we were in steak heaven at this point -Orange Creme Brule- My favorite dessert; I just love the caramelized sugar on top! Never had orange before but it actually was super subtle and good -Pineapple tart cake with sorbet- My husband's favorite dessert; It had grilled pineapple on top with a super tasty sorbet  The service was spot on through out and the waiter was very knowledgable about our wine and what would pair with it.   All in all, we will definitely be back but probably only for a special occasion, as the prices were pretty high in comparison to other tapas style places in Charlotte.",

They had half off bottles of wine which was a great way to go for the table. We got a ton of different appetizers, small plates, entrees, etc. to all share. I will admit the miso soup wasn't as warm as I'd like, but the absolute best parts of the meal are the pork belly, the cod, and the salmon. I am not even a big fish person but they are INCREDIBLE. The chocolate dessert was really great too, and overall not a very expensive meal considering how much food we ordered for 6 people. Definitely would recommend it!",

He knew it was out first time there and he walked us through the menus (food and drink) and make several spot-on recommendations.   The cocktails were off-the-hook! I had the Watermelon Basil and French Pear cocktails. My husband had Pom Kasai and French Pear cocktails...they were all fantastic!   For appetizers, we had Gyoza and Pork Belly. We then ordered the Spicy Filet and Kalbi (short ribs) for our second course, along with the Crispy Brussels Sprouts. Each dish was perfection!",

The service was both slow and inconsiderate. Asked for a good warm sake recommendation. Was offered one - $1000 bottle - and when we said we weren't planning to spend that much, were told she didn't have another recommendation to offer. I've enjoyed a lot of sake under $1000 over the years and could not believe she had not. We chose for ourselves, it was brought out on ice instead of warmed and left at the table. After a few minutes we opened it, she came back and softly scolded us, saying that was her job. It was awkward. Then she made a comment that she was interested in knowing what a budget sake tasted like. It was bizarre and ruined our festive vibe. We also waited a little over an hour to receive our sushi. No one ever updated us on our food, so when we finally asked, she just said they were slammed. They really looked pretty wide open on the first floor and our reservation was well after the dinner rush. When the sushi arrived it was delicious, but we couldn't wait to get out of there. We will never come back.",

    "text": "So this is a very very hard review to write because the review is significantly biased by the service. The food and fish quality - unparalleled in charlotte. This is the type of nigiri that I have had in japan. The omakase is a great deal at 40!  But, and this is a huge but, the service was an absolute nightmare. We sat upstairs on a very slow Monday and it took 2+ hours to eat. Absolutely insane. Many many things went wrong too...my husband asked for no wasabi, there was wasabi embedded in each piece. To get it right took about 20-30 min after waiting for 45 min before! And then we asked for separate checks. The waiter didn't do it and told us to just split it 3 ways because that's easier. We said no because we ordered differently. Then he brought the check, all wrong. He already ran one card and said he would run a separate one for the one piece he forgot. This took about 10 min.   And through all of this, not ONCE did he offer to come anything. We were blown away because among 3 people we spent 400 on a Monday night. There are no words. How can this be???  So again, great fish. I'd love to say I'd come back but the service element was beyond reproach. They had multiple chances to fix this and didn't. Also there was someone walking around asking about the service at first but they never came by again even though we went back the food. Very unfortunate.  FYI - since I posted this review, a business manager from the restaurant reached out but nothing to report yet...",

This place could use a refresher on the \"customer is always right\" concept. I prefer super sweet drinks, with little to no trace of a liquor taste. I really enjoyed the first drink I ordered but the second tasted like cough syrup. I was told by a \"manager in training\" that I would've liked it better without the additional simple syrup. No, I would not have liked a drink that had an even stronger liquor taste than sweet.   The calamari had absolutely no flavor and needed salt. In combination with the dipping sauce, it was tolerable. The rest of the food was great though- lobster rolls, shrimp dumplings, Japanese popcorn chicken.",

The only thing I found to be a deal was the omakase desert platter and the omakase nigiri 20 piece platter I believe it was called. Everything else we ordered I honestly can find for the same quality for a lot cheaper.   I was disappointed with our server as well because he was just very apathetic and stone faced and not too attentive with us. We also informed him that it was our anniversary but all he did was say happy anniversary. When we ordered desert I thought there would at least be a candle on it. When we first came in as well the hostess kind of just stared at us a minute and didn't really welcome us.   Just a little frustrated with this place because I've heard so many good things but it also seems like they keep changing the menu and removing things that they were well known for! The food (for example the gyoza) overall I will say again was good. I just wasn't impressed with everything else. The Wagyu is also Japanese and they have a certificate for anyone who wants to verify. The Wagyu roll was also another thing that was a great deal!",

Although, Baku was pretty fusion-esk , but they kept traditional Japanese izakaya and sushi cuisine.   The chef marinated sushi - you don't need to dip sushi in shoyu (soy sauce).   Otoro was exceptional! The cut of sashimi was amazing. No sinew.  Uni - ikura- hamachi. You name it, all were amazing.  Our server was amazing. She was very helpful with menu and very attentive.   I will look forward to come back here.  The only constructive criticism I have here, the sushi rice was over cooked.  Now, the rice is critical and also big part of sushi, nigiri.   But one overdone batch can happen.   I really enjoyed Baku.   I recommend if you want good sushi.   Fyi 1 uni spoon is $21.  Giving heads up",

I will say, however, Baku is by far the best sushi spot I've been to in Charlotte so for that, it might even deserve 5 stars (for Charlotte).  It's a bit of a trek from Uptown, but totally worth it for a large party (12) like we had.  My expectations started off a bit low given this place didn't seem all that authentic Japanese to me, but I was surprised at how good some of the food was.  They had a couple guys waiting our table and the service was fast and comprehensive.  They did a great job taking our orders and providing food in a timely and organized manner.  I also checked the receipt like I always do at large events to make sure everything checked out and it did.  As for the food, we ordered so many things on the menu I can't even begin to remember what all we ate.  However, the following stood out to me:  Uni - actually I was super surprised at how fresh the uni was here.  You get a pretty decent serving if you choose to have it \"sashimi\" style.  The stuff melted in my mouth and honestly.... this was really good uni - coming from myself and a coworker who both love uni  Baku yellowtail - crunchy spicy yellowtail, avocado, topped with yellowtail and serrano pepper - favorite roll of the night (and we pretty much ordered them all)  The pork belly skewers were actually a stand out also - this stuff basically melted in your mouth and was the perfect crispy on the outside melty on the inside consistency.  10/10 would order again.  Things I would skip - calamari and karaage.  Both batters were a bit strange for me and weren't special compared to other things on the menu.  Great for groups, worth the trek from Uptown for a meal.",

After everyone was done with their meal and was ready to order dessert, I told the waiter again that I didn't get the calamari. Finally It arrives but it's salty and oily. The remoulade served with It was bland, basically pink colored mayonnaise. The worst part? They didn't clean the calamari right and i ended up with a chunk of the cartilage in my teeth. One star off for the late appetizer and the cartilage. Yuck!   The other dishes ranged from ok to delicious. I knocked off another star for the food since the bad outweighed the good.   The good:  NY strip steak was cooked perfectly and came with rice, asparagus and a dipping sauce. All were scrumptious!  The Dragon Roll was perfect. I substituted the salmon for shrimp tempura (I must be the only sushi lover in the world that hates raw salmon) and It was so good. The eel was bbq'd perfectly, the avocado was ripe and creamy and the little bite of asian pear gave A nice crunch.   The bad:  Edamame was served without salt but with sweet chili sauce that did not pair well to me and tasted like It came right out of a bottle.  Pork belly was very fatty. I was expecting a crispy texture but It was super soft and gelatinous. I wouldn't order It again.  The hamachi was served with pickled onions- all you could taste was vinegar. Straight up vinegar.  The beignets were the same fried donuts you'd get at any standard Chinese takeout except they rolled it in cinnamon sugar and served It over icing. It was very dense and heavy.   The manager came out and comped desserts to make up for me not receiving the appetizer in time. But this was done while we were waiting for dessert. Several minutes later, only two of the four ordered beignets came out. We asked for our checks, paid and signed the receipts and still missing two desserts. We finally asked for them to go. The waiter went back and forth with us saying we only ordered two beignets, not four. But everyone at our table heard each person order.  Mark off another star for that awkward argument.   I received a gift certificate for my next visit but I don't see myself going back any time soon. Even with the Queens Feast special, the food was not worth the price and the service is lacking.",

There are other decent places, but not really AMAZING places...until Baku.   My friends told me about Baku, but I didn't want to listen... I found it hard to believe, but we went anyways and they were spot on.   The restaurant is adorable and nicely appointed. We ate upstairs. There's hardwood floors and a cool bar up. Our service was wonderful.   First round: filthy martini, pear drink, and wine for the three of us  First round food:  Brussels Sprouts: amazing, mostly broken up into chips and fried. A sweet sauce, which I actually could do without Pork belly: fab! Great sauce Short ribs: seemed underdone at first, but actually were a table favorite  Bang bang shrimp: had the shrimp inside and it was yummy  Second round:  Otoro: melt on the tongue also, our waiter shared a picture of the fish it was from which was cool  Chilean Seabass: delicious... Shu Mai: we didn't love this, but it was good...just shrimp in dumpling paper...not as flavorful as the pork shu Mai we are used to",

    "text": "The manager needs to have a chat with the bartender named Taylor. She just really put a huge damper on our dining experience last night.   Here's the thing, I've worked restaurant week. I did it for years and I get it... it's not fun. It's a different flow at work for nicer restaurants. Servers are used to working 3-6 tables and making bank. Restaurant week means double the work for the same money. I get that BUT with that being said your customers should not hear you complain about it. You are still at your job, be professional. You are also still making money so again stop complaining like you are so spoiled! This is twice a year, you can do it!  During our dining experience last night we were sat at a high top table around the bar. Colton greeted us quickly but not before I heard we heard a group of servers saying they hope they can make it through this night if hell. Colton was very kind and offered suggestions to us. He didn't make us feel guilty for wanting to indulge in the RW menu. We ordered a few drinks and started sipping on those but very quickly got distracted by Taylor talking to a couple at the bar. Complaining about the clientele of restaurant week. \"It's the absolute worst! It's a good thing you guys got here before the wolves come out to play tonight\". I'm completely appalled that a server would speak like this openly. WAIT IT GETS WORSE!!! A gentlemen came to our table to refill waters and I thanked him for working during restaurant week while acknowledging that we understand it's more stressful than the norm. The waiter then started to rant about how they normally run an average of $90 a person so this $35 a person menu is horrible. \"We all hate it\", he said to me and my husband. We heard Taylor at the bar speak ill about the week two more times during our meal.   Colton got really busy at the bar and our service suffered because of it. We spent a lot more than just \"restaurant week money\". We ordered an additional sushi roll and several drinks. I also am from the service industry so we tip well and are understanding about elements that effect service but were disappointed overall.  Notes on the food: For the 3 course meal my husband and I both selected the Yellowtail starter. I was under impressed by this. WAY TO MUCH RADISH! Second course my husband got the Hamachi Rice Crispy Treat and I got the pork dumplings, these were good but they all came out with the Yellowtail in the matter of a minute. We were trying to enjoy our evening and they should have courses this out for us. We could also tell that the rice crispy wasn't cooked to order, it was cold. For our main course we both got the NY strip cooked to Medium Rare. The strip was a great portion size and came with a few pieces of asparagus and wait MORE RADISH. We both enjoyed the steak flavor. We got the Dragon roll in addition to the RW menu and we liked this, very fresh surprise with the pear inside of the roll.   I would have loved to give this experience a few more stars but service is a HUGE part of a guest experience and it really impacted our evening. HAVE A CHAT WITH THE STAFF ABOUT THEIR ATTITUDES AND PROFESSIONALISM!",

I enjoyed this place so much that I've been raving about it since to my partner who took me here for date night last night.   Basically I was slightly underwhelmed considering my first experience.  The service was impeccable but unfortunately the food was a little disappointing. One of my favorite dishes is the crispy Brussels sprouts and the first order came out kinda burned instead of charred. Then I ordered the beef skewers and honestly the texture and flavor was very weird. During restaurant week I ordered the skirt steak and asparagus and that's definitely a better choice. The calamari was amazing though this time it was a little more rubbery than previously and finally the chicken good but also not as crispy. Idk what was up with Baku last night but we were literally like the first people there around 5:30pm.   Rating 4 stars mostly because of my first experience with food and my second experience with the server. Will try again and hopefully the food is consistent.",

I think if you're going to spend money on sushi and normal items that you can get anywhere else...you can, but just know there are a lot of other things on the menu that you're missing out. Let's just say I didn't do much ordering, as my brother mostly had that on lock since he knew what was good and wasn't.  What did we eat... Good question. Let's just say it was an assortment of food and the quality were all great. I'll go through each photo, but to be honest, the otoro is what you should look at getting (the picture that's on the ice). I think that dish is amazing especially just the experience of it. There are all these other options as well, but to me that one stood out.   The restaurant is a little dark, but it's going for the lounge/romantic setting which I understand. We sat upstairs next to the bar and it was pretty comfortable. If you're looking for a good solid sushi/japanese restaurant and it's for a special occasion, I would definitely suggest that Baku would be on that list.",

The food is amazing especially their wagyu beef and Nigiri. However, their dessert chocolate cake tasted like the instant Betty Crocker stuff. I will still let that slide as the appetizers and main course and the service were exceptional. Also loved the contemporary feel. If this restaurant closes there really will be no options in this city next time I want a fancy night out.",

For a sushi sample, I tried the mushroom roll with the truffle oil.  It was ok.  I originally wanted to Forbidden roll and should have gone with that.   I also ordered the grilled tofu skewers and a side dish of kimchee.  Both were excellent and could make a meal on their own.  After all that I ate, I did not have room for dessert, but I saw the wonderful dessert platters on ice coming out of the kitchen and wish I had room to try one.",

    "text": "Halloween night dinner!   I wanted to pick a fun place for dinner that would have a festive theme - but I wanted something different. Baku was it. They had a DJ set up that gave the upstairs area a fun vibe, and there were a handful of people dressed up.   I made reservations and my party was seated at a comfortable table behind the bar. We noted the cool decor along with a few funky Halloween items.   The wine list is neat: they have a few unusual items. I tried the Bollini Pinot Grigio, and my friends took part in the specials. The prices were fair on drinks - this is a nice place in a great location so don't expect dive-bar prices.   The food comes in a tapas/sharing style. I split the Robata skewer of tofu, and the Tempura Rock Shrimp. My other friends had the salmon, dumplings, sushi, and it all looked really good! On the next trip, I plan to try some of the substantial dinner plates.  With the way they made the tofu taste awesome, I'm excited to see what else they have to offer.  The waitress was very attentive to our large, festive group, and kept checking on us between her other tables. Even though it was a busy night, the service was consistently good.  I'm planning on coming again.",

The Izikaya style of restaurant is indeed small plates for sharing which I live.  Baku have joined Izikaya with fine dining. In my opinion this does not work.  Supposed to be inexpensive and pub type atmosphere which Baku is neither.   The waiters are well trained and well informed but this does not help the sell.  They don't help you organize the order very well.    Ok Ok.  In short. Great food, pretentious attitude and over the top setting.  May suit some but if I am going to pay for and wish to have fine dining. I will do just that, not try for the casual sharing experience of Izikaya in a pompous setting.   Good is great but will not return. Sorry.  Unless they lighten up.  Let me know.   Best.    SC.",

Then ordered \"king crab pot\", which came in a fancy pot but no taste to it all(It was priced for $17, but it was not even worth 2$ and I would pay those 2$ for that fancy pot and would not pay a dime for the food).

We arrived on time and was told by the host our table would be ready shortly.  We moved to the side and waited.  We waited five minutes... ten minutes... fifteen minutes... twenty minutes... twenty-five minutes... thirty minutes.  Still did not get our so-called reserved seat.    Meanwhile, other guests who walked in the door with no reservations got sat almost immediately.  What's the point of making a reservation at this establishment?  They will take reservations but they will not honor them.  We complained to the manager, who didn't apologize or made any attempts at trying to reconcile the situation.  The blonde female host is completely unprofessional and rude.  They all need a course in How-To-Be-A-Civil-Person 101.  We left. We don't plan on going there ever again.  F*** you, Baku.  P.S.  We also witnessed one of the line cooks literally blowing on the food he was cooking, while it was on the grill - spit and everything.  It must be the secret ingredient.",

I don't want to take away from the food because it was good but not super special to explain the prices.  Perhaps we were paying for the atmosphere which was very nice.

For a full meal with wine/drinks, starters, etc I would say this is just as expensive as The Palm, Capital Grill, etc...  It's definitely with trying and if on a budget just  look for more reasonably priced small pates and rolls.",

Anyway, the service was terrible. Our waiter did not describe the menu at all; no explanation of how the small plates work, etc.  My hubby and I knew what questions to ask, but the waiter didn't seem to know the menu, or just didn't care.  Anyway, we saw him once after that.  The food was ok, but bland; nothing to go back for. As a former sever myself, I am usually very understanding when a restaurant is busy, and my hubs and I really don't expect much except to be checked on periodically....we didn't even get that, and the restaurant was not busy.  Anyway, we won't be back, but maybe they just had an off night? The drinks were good though, hence the two stars!",

Second and last positive is the reasonably priced wine and decent selection. The food is good, we did not have a bad dish. Our table of 6 ate tapas style and ate a wide variety from the edamame (delicious chili sauce) to the wagu beef. Unfortunately this is challenging because the portions are so small. Although they encourage tapas sharing, the dishes are barely appropriate for 2 to share. The food did not rock my world, but it was good. Then the bill came. For a table of 6 to spend $1,000 including gratuity, I would expect to be eating Nobu quality food. I have no problem paying for a meal that is outstanding, once in a lifetime experience. Unfortunately, that is not Baku in Southpark. Outrageously priced food.  Unfortunately we will not be back. Ever.",

    "text": "A new Izakaya restaurant, very posh and upscale.    I expected an izakaya to be less formal and less stiff. More of a watering hole for the tired salaryman but this place has turned the local watering hole into a semi-formal dining establishment. Lots of uniformed waiters, a sake sommelier, a valet.. its just a wierd vibe for an izakaya.  The clientele is all dressed up for dinner, in heels and all. Kinda snobby.  Service is impeccable. They will take very good care of you. Our server was cordial and attentive.  We just about ate everything on the menu. Even had their Nanbu Bijin Dai Ginjo. Kitchen is fast. Our skewers came very quickly.  The best is the scallops and prok belly. So good, we asked for 2 more plate. The Omakase, at $60 for 3 was expensive.  There simply wasn't enough to justify $60 for 3.  I would say the portion was enough for 1 person.  All the other plates were OK.  Nothing too spectacular.  Sake list is good. They had a few bottles from JunMai to DaiGinjo. We had the KiKuSui , which came is such a small 300ml bottle is was pathetic. We stepped up and got the $150 Nanbu Bijin that was much better. The next time , I would ask them to sit the bottle in a bed of ice. I kinda like my sake colder.  Anyway, its not your typical relaxed, let your hair down, end of the day, drop your butt down and drink your tired day away of an Izakaya.  People actually dress up and come here to be seen. Sorta different vibe, sorta pretentious..but damn good service.  It is on the pricey side.",

I also loved the green tea-infused salt.  That was new and interesting.    Pork Dumplings, again, oily, and a little thick in the skin, chewy.    Tenderloin Skewer...sort of bland.  The pricing is what I'd expect for Charlotte, but I don't think the food rates those prices.  We sat at the bar downstairs, which is a nice bar, but smaller.  Our bartenders were very nice but one bartender was really loud and he would make loud comments about what he was watching on sports center and when he was chatting with other staff it was obtrusive.  Also in the bar area... everyone from the kitchen staff, managers, hostesses... would come behind the bar to fill up their drinks, get ice, check out what was going on on sports center, chat....  It was really a bit irritating.  The bar isn't that big and although I would choose to sit further away from the tv side if I'm eating at the bar next time - it was just odd that it is set up that way.  I recommend people try it and I definitely want to sit upstairs next time.",

I reserved a table for four at 6:30 and saw many empty tables while we dining until when we were leaving around 8:30. Now, the food: it is a very small limited menu so not sure what the hype is about. The dragon roll was my favorite and lychee martini was delicious. It is an overpriced place that lacks service (second round of drinks took forever to come) and variety in menu. I would likely not return here, we paid 200 some dollars for four people and  still left hungry and unsatisfied food wise specifically",

We went in for Queen's Feast Restaurant Week, and everything we ate was pretty tasty. We added on the pork belly skewers per our server's recommendation, and it was delicious! The biggest issue here was attentiveness of our waiter. He was very friendly and enthusiastic, however, it wasn't even that busy, yet we frequently ran out of water. We also asked about sake when we placed our order, yet the expert did not come around to explain until the end of our meal. One of our dishes was forgotten, and we had to remind him we ordered it. Worst of all, when we were ready to leave, it was very difficult to get the check, and we had to even ask another waiter to ring it up for us. Again, the food was above average, but overall, we expected better service.  Update: After writing this review, my boyfriend went to Whole Foods to buy a sandwich because he was still hungry. Not exactly what you want after a $100+ meal.",

Fantastic selection of apps (the tartare and the tempura cod bites are out of this world good), and the prices are reasonable IMO. There's almost never a wait either, so that's a huge plus.

Easily Baku has been in my top 5 choices for dinner in Charlotte, especially on special occasions. Tonight was quite a diversion from the norm. Focally there were multiple items not available, Shishito Peppers, several other appetizers, and a few entrees. In the past we had been captivated by the Tomahawk steak and Wagyu beef. Well understanding that the other entrees were \"tapas\" portions, for the money it was a bit meager. One of the six in our party ordered diver scallops, which sets the expectation they should be large. Unfortunately they missed expectations and were small. With all of the absent dishes the flavor of the dishes and service are the only reason I am giving 3 stars. I heard the menu is being updated, but still not a good enough reason for having so many missing dishes. Lastly if it weren't for the aforementioned positives I would have rated tonight a 1 or a 2. I hope these issues are temporary and I look forward to possibly giving it another try soon.",

We finished the meal with a sumptuous slice of chocolate cake with white chocolate mousse -- a fantastic ending to another amazing meal at one of Charlotte's best restaurants.",

I found the sashimi was either too cold or certainly not melt-in-the-mouth fresh.  The assortment was so plain I could have found more eclecticism in a grocery store and the slices were strangely extremely thick cuts, not at all expertly done.  Served on a giant block of ice this was boorish sushi 101.    They claimed to have fresh wasabi, but apparently don't know what this means as it was the powdery fake stuff.  I even asked the server and they thought it was fresh.  I didn't bemoan it in person because I didn't want to be *that guy* but the servers should at least be educated on the cuisine.  The Baku salad is the best thing to order here as the greens are fresh and the dressing light and sweet.   The edamame was disappointing and had a freeze-dried texture to it--eew!  As I'm a glutton for punishment I tried the miso-glazed black cod.  Even though I had pointed out to my server that I wanted to do a healthy meal, he didn't mention their miso cod is basically butter cod!!  I almost forgot the kumamoto oysters which were one step away from being off and garishly presented with giant watermelon bubbles which looked like some sort of sick growth.",

The pork belly came in next and was very juicy and tender. Raw scallop was perfect on the sushi plate, just wish there was more. The ribs were a bit too salty and the Brussels sprouts were too oily (even asked for them with out oil after seeing them on someone else's table). The tomahawk steak wasn't a great value and didn't compare to the others I've ordered around. It's our 3rd or 4th time coming here, we will be back but will try other items!",

I've been here before twice but both were for restaurant week. I really enjoyed trying their regular menu, and our waiter was really helpful! They had a special that night of Bluefin tuna served 3 ways from fattiest to least fatty. I would come back just to eat platefuls of that and the salmon belly. Holy God it was good. It should melt in your mouth, which it did, quickly. It was gone in a matter of minutes. We also had the rock shrimp tempura and one of the sushi rolls. Both excellent. My only complaint was that the pork belly was overcooked and the fire alarm went off due to poor ventilation, but all in all, excellent experience!! I will be back!",

My favorite dishes are the scallop skewers, calamari app, and the sushi rolls. The pork belly app is also very delicious if seafood is not your style. Not the best to come here starving or your bill will be quite large.   Tip: if you are looking for a quieter dining experience I recommend requesting to seat downstairs, especially on the weekends. If you enjoy a more lively experience sit upstairs where the bar is at. Also a tv or two up there. On the weekends the music is turned up and it is very energetic, but may be too loud for some. They also have a small patio area out front.",

The food is awesome, no doubt but for the manager to feel as though a paying customer is an inconvenience because I didn't look like the other party was disgraceful. Let me not forget to mention that we stood their for 15 minutes as the staff walked past us without even acknowledging our existence. The manager did let me know he isn't under a corporation so he can do as he pleased. Wow is all I have... Maybe he forgot about social media and its ability to bring awareness and change.

I'm all about Tappas but that was just bad! I would recommend against...a total let down and would suggest going to McDonalds. After all, that's what I wanted after I left!",

    "text": "So in town for my regular visit from out west and this was the BEST MEAL I've had in months!!  I've been to a couple restaurants similar to Baku in Miami and Los Angles but Baku takes the cake for overall best concept!  We started with the chicken wings and they were probably the best I've ever had and I would say, I'm somewhat of a wings expert!  They were grilled crispy to perfection, the lime juice and salt they give you to sprinkle make the dish!  We had the scallops with smoked duck and they were outstanding!  The sleeper was the Baku salad, which I easily could have eaten a couple extra bowls of.....  For an entree I got the lamb chops and my date got the grilled chicken and both were out of this world!  Overall A++++++     I  read some of the other reviews and don't understand how some people say this place is expensive unless they are Burger King customers.....  Our meal including a fabulous Sake bottle was less than $100!!  GREAT VALUE for what you get!",

Our waiter, Mark, definitely made us feel comfortable and since we had never dined at Baku before, he went over the history and menu with us.  He was very knowledgeable, hospitable, and helpful with our selections.  We decided to order a variety of things to share.  Each of the plates were spaced out perfectly, so as soon as we were done with one plate, a new plate came just minutes later.  It was absolutely delicious and we will definitely be returning.",

    "text": "Liked the decor and the server was extremely knowledgable . The drinks were on the weak side but I'm sure it was just a measured pour. We enjoyed the food we had the giant Madagascar prawn, the pork belly skewers, 2 different sushi rolls one was a blue fin tuna ,the other was crab and we started with the roasted oysters . The oysters were my favorite item, exceptional flavor and had me looking forward to what was next , all the food was prepared and presented exceptionally well but other than the oysters i wasnts \"wowed\" by any of the flavors.  We understood the portions were small as the menu is all Tapas style..( don't go looking for a large portion meal)  The mango cake and the chocolate lava cake were our  deserts they were also very good, the mango cake was a little dry. We like to eat at a lot of high end restaurants and expect to pay for it but I thought Baku was a little over priced for what it was.  It is a great place to meet for a cocktail then a couple of apps before dinner elsewhere ... Didn't hate it and had a great evening but not overly impressed.",

When walking in, you feel like you are in Tokyo/NYC/South Beach/Hollywood all at the same time.  Great ambiance and music.  It was quite busy that night.  I must also add that we had over 10 people in our party, so it was rather challening for our waiter.  I'll have to go try it again, to see if they improved on their service but other than that,  the food was excellent.  The dessert  was incredible!  It was a giant mountain (literally looked like a mountain) of ice cream gelato, cake, fruit and several other things.  Absolutely delicious!  What a great addition to SouthPark and to Charlotte in general!  So glad to see something more unique in this area instead of the usual Steakhouses and franchise crap.",

The concept is Japanese-inspired shared plates - presented to the table one at a time so that diners can fully enjoy the flavors of each dish.   We loved being able to try many different dishes, each impeccably prepared and presented beautifully.  Every dish we had was delicious but we especially enjoyed the lamb chops and the pork belly.  The restaurant is gorgeous with gleaming stone walls, textured fiber ceilings, sleek bamboo furniture, vivid art pieces, and perfect lighting.  The upstairs lounge is exquisite!",

    "text": "After my initial review last November, the manager of Baku reached out to me and kindly offered to send me a gift card to try the restaurant again. I have been meaning to go back but since I travel a lot I was finally able to have dinner there last night. A few weeks back my parents went with some of their friends and told me they had a wonderful experience! I was excited to give Baku another shot and they definitely have vastly improved since my last visit. The service and food were both great! I will definitely be coming back. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered a variety of items but the standouts were the asparagus, the spicy tuna on crispy rice, the lobster & avocado roll, the tiger prawns tempura (not too breaded), and the chirasi. We also loved the chocolate coconut cake - it was delicious! I was also impressed with the drinks - I got the cucumber jalapeno margarita and also tried the strawberry tune. Both were super yummy and innovative. Again, I will say that it is definitely on the pricey side, so be prepared to spend! :)   It definitely goes to show that it is always good to give restaurants a second chance, especially one that is fairly new. I appreciate the manager for reaching out to me and I look forward to my next meal at Baku.",

Very cool!  The service was impeccable.  We started out with the delicious white truffle artichokes, moving on to the pork belly and kimchi that was spicy and tasted like the ocean...both delicious, as well.  Next came a special of eggplant and mushroom dumplings.  They were...meh...ok, but my husband loved them, as he is a super-fan of ginger, and me, not so much.  The last course was the wagyu beef tartare that was topped with a quail egg and accompanied with cavier.  Holy crap!  I wasn't wild about the idea of eating raw beef, but my husband said there wasn't another option.  I dove in......and finished most of the dish without sharing.    I can't wait to dine here again and try some other items!",

We were seated by the hostess at what looked like a bar table, people at the bar kept bumping into us.   The service was energetic, but too much. I may not have eaten at a Japanese Robata before but I have eaten at a restaurant before and I understand the concept of small plates and getting lighter dishes first and then moving on to heavier dishes. All of these concepts (and many more) were explained to us in great detail by our waiter, It was just too much.  He even told me I was eating one dish incorrectly.  He also told us in Japan its considered rude to use the wet cloths they bring out before the food for anything other than cleaning your hands.  Apparently, he was concerned we would take sponge baths in the dining room. So that was special.   I really enjoyed the food itself but the waiter was way too much a part of our dinner, the noise was bad, drinks were slow, and we had no room.  I will go back for the food and that is the only reason I gave it 3 stars, but if we have the same waiter I will run for the door.",
