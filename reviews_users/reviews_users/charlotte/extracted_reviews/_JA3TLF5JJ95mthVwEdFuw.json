    "text": "So the first time I had Steak N Shake was when my friend bought it for me while I was at home watching movies. So I have not experienced the service personally. But when I first saw my burger (the Jalapeno one), it wasn't very good-looking. I took one bite, hm, okay. I took another, actually biting into the meat and everything this time, and it was like a party in my mouth! It was delicious! I finished my burger before my friend, and I wanted another one! (Unfortunately my friend had only bought me one burger :[ ) So, 5 stars for the food!",

My guy friend and I are on a mission to find food, he see's how stress I am about getting some food in me cause I was so hungry and still on Cali. time! He brough me here- STEAK N SHAKE, man- I like the old-school diner feel to it, real cute. We walked in through the door and here was a loud waiter! I was like whoa? its so early in the morning and here he is acting crazy (I guess thats how you stay awake LOL) he seated us at the table and began asking us what we wanted, I said I didn't know since I've never been! He gave me a run-down of all his faves,so I said well- since you like it I might as well try it- so I ordered a chicken burger. Meal was also prepared by our waiter, it came out in a timely fashion (THANKS) He began talking to us and making us feel real comfortable, I swear he was HILARIOUS- such a comedian! He reminded me of Dave Chappelle (i'm serious).  Overall, the meal was incredibly awesome and next time I'm in Charlotte I will most definitely be coming back to this STEAK N SHAKE!.",

We went through the drive through, and the girl at the window charged us twice for our order, then had to get a manager to void one. It's been 2 weeks and the charge still hasnt been reversed on our card. They also, got our order wrong. The last time, they completely forgot half of our food. Luckily, we checked the bag and went in, and the manager (same guy from the previous time) didn't even acknowledge us standing there, just walked over and handed us the missing bag of food and walked away. Horrible location, especially for overly greasy burgers. Go across the street to Cookout instead!",

We went through the drive through so we could get home and get more work done, it took 15 mins to get our food, and we orders 3 meals. The service was horrible. We first got our shakes, I ordered a Peanut Butter shake.. I received a Vanilla shake with a couple of shavings of Peanut Butter on top of the whip cream, other than that I drank a Vanilla shake. My sister ordered a Mint Oreo shake and same thing she received a mint shake with a couple of pieces of Oreo on her whip cream. After we got our food we got home starving and ready to eat! The french fries were cold with NO flavoring, NO salt NO nothing. They were the worst fries I've ever had!!! Then we get the the burgers. The bread was saggy mush and the burger were bland and gross!!! Again they were cold! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!",

Especially at night, everyone is rude. We don't go in and dine at night anymore, but instead just use the drive thru. Even though they don't do so well in the customer service department, I recommend going back just for the sake of their good food. They actually cook all their food fresh, instead of McDonald's for example. You won't be disappointed.",

We got to Steak N Shake around 7 o'clock pm and waited 30 minutes to be seated then waited another 15 minutes before anyone came and took our drink orders then waited 17 minutes before we got our milkshakes and another 22 before we got our food now you would think the restaurant was slam packed but it was not there were about four other tables than ours and about 15 people working. I do not know what the problem is other than the time the drive thru and it seems all of their concern for customer service goes to that because it's being reported back to their corporate office. By the time we got out it was after 9 p.m. and everyone was less than happy there was a line to speak to the manager as everyone in the restaurant was very upset with the quality of service. The food wasn't bad but with all of the frustration of service it's hard to enjoy so if you're looking for good food fast go somewhere else.",

    "text": "It pains me to give this Steak N' Shake a 2-star rating because I've been to it before when it first opened and it was great.  My experiences at other branches have also been decent.    It may have been the fact that we went there around 1030pm and there were only 2 servers/hostess.  There were plenty of tables, but we had to wait to be seated since many of the empty tables still had dirty dishes on them (still True after we sat at our table - they didn't clean the other tables off immediately).    The waitress, poor girl, was running around trying to get everyone.  She acknowledged us, but then took another 10-15 minutes to come back and take our orders.  The food arrived in a timely manner, but they only brought 2 of our 4 orders (missing bowl of chili and she totally forgot to put in hubby's cookies and cream milkshake).  My mom and hubby were almost done with their meals before I got my bowl of chili.  She was apologetic.  Then I noticed the table behind us had been waiting to get refills on their drinks for a while and after a point, the lady went up to the waitress herself and asked for a new drink.  She offered her a complimentary side of fries.  The only redeeming factor was the food.  It reminds me of back in high school when we would go to Steak N' Shake late at night after a movie.  They have delicious mocha shakes, chili mac, and the frisco melt.  I liked how they added a variety of slider flavors and keep increasing their milk shake offerings.  Their shoe-string fries have a nice crispy batter (and the portions are just right).  For a place that's opened 24-hours, they should consider hiring more staff to help on the floor.  It was pretty busy that night.  And please clean up the tables immediately after customers leave - it's pretty unappetizing to eat next to a table of dirty, used dishes.  Shoulda went to COOK-OUT across the street...",

After waiting about 20 minutes to even come to the table, she took our drink order and and didn't come back for 15 minutes at least. It was not even busy, maybe 4 other tables and 2 other servers. We were looking at her just standing there talking and not getting our drinks. She even Refilled a different tables drinks, then went back to talking to other workers before getting our drinks. It's too bad because we all really like steak and shake. The manager was just hanging out not very concerned that his restaurant has a lot of issues.",

The concept of shakes and hamburgers was very awesome to me.  Over the years, the chain has gotten bigger and changed somewhat... but they are still going strong.    This location is friendly and is a 24hr location.  Seems like their new promotion is a \"Happy Hour\" for shakes between 2-4pm and 2-4am!!!  It was almost tempting to try and come back a 2am...  but we decided to wise up a bit.  Food portions have fluctuated... so it seems like the portions are down a bit - but it's a good thing so that you don't feel over stuffed when leaving.

Being in a forgetful state, I realized I never got my change nor a receipt to state what I gave to the cashier. I had to return to the location and notify them. I was met with an employee who stated \" I counted my drawer and it looks correct\". I was then asked for the receipt I wasn't given which I informed her of. I noticed her looking at receipts that were crumbled up and she came across mine which stated I only gave her 11.81 which explains why I didn't get my change so I guess Steak n Shake was just going to keep my $10.

Watched food coming outnof the kitchen.  Others that came after us were being served.  2 waitresses came by and filled our drinks and kept reassuring us that our food would be there shortly.   Well, shortly never came.    45 minutes after we ordered,....still no food....and we missed the movie we had planned to attend.  We finally got up and walked out.  On the way out, I heard one of the servers yell to the manager \"Table 13 is walking out\".   Obviously they didnt care.   No one tried to stop us, apologize, or offer anything to make it right for us.  Steak and Shake was a real disappointment.   We ended up going next door to Zaxbys and had our food within 10 minutes.    What a waste of time.",

The service is comically bad, from terrible waitstaff,  being told there would be a twenty minute wait while in the drive thru (after waiting twenty minutes i was told it would be twenty more), order mix ups, the list goes on and on.   There have been a few times where i have brought my guests there for dinner and left ashamed of the service they provided. I love the food but everything else...wow. I think I'll take my money elsewhere until they get it together.",

Had the triple burger with heavy pickles and granddaughter had spicy chicken sandwich (too spicy to her) then got something to go for wife the 3 way chili to go. My god it was like a less than kids portion. It was for my wife.   The food while there and the waitress was great.   The service great.   I looked up a former review about the bathroom as well. The guy who wrote about the bathroom was not far from wrong. It needs to be cleaned badly taken care of hourly.   The portion size on their chili to go was seriously small,not worth the money.",

We got to the window and were given our milkshakes. We drove off. But we soon realized Our milkshakes were both incorrect. One was banana and the other was mystery. Thank goodness  i'm not allergic to bananas. We drove back to have them redo our milkshakes. Well as my fiance was walking into the restaurant he dropped one of the milkshakes. Instead of bringing a messy cup into the restaurant he decided to just leave it there. He goes inside to try and tell them that the milkshakes were wrong and if they could please remake them. The lady at the counter told him that our milkshakes were correct. And she accused him of lying just so he could get two more milkshakes. (He brought the shakes back just so they would know we werent trying to hassle for free shakes even though we already paid for them) I do not always believe the saying that the customer is always right. But honestly it is a low thing to do to go in and try to lie about a milkshake out of all things just to get a free one. Wish we were treated better. Will not be coming back to this place again.",

This place ranks high only for consistency - albeit for bad service. We waited over 10 minutes for a waiter to approach us.    Of the five orders, four were wrong even though they were repeated.  We had to request silver twice.  And then had to again request a spoon for the chili.  The portion for the  Childs Mac was quite small.   One in our party ordered cottage cheese.  When the meals came he told us they don't carry it.  I asked what we could substitute and he was surprised that we would want an alternative side.    This isn't the first time we had the problem with cottage cheese at this location. They NEVER carry it at this location even though it stays on the menu. The meals took longer to arrive than at any other location in Georgia or Florida.  When we told our server that we wanted to order shakes he walked away.  Another server went to him to explain that we really wanted shakes.  He came over to ask if we really wanted to order.  I guess few people order shakes at Steak and Shake.    We like the chain but this location is so poor that we are unlikely to return.",

Tonight (07/28/17 @ 12:00 AM) is the third time we tried to dine in at this location and I don't even know why we keep giving it a try. First of all, the place was nowhere near being too busy. Sure there were diners but we should've have had to wait over 20 minutes to have a server come to our table. Well, 20 minutes passed and still nothing. The place is horrible. We've dined at daytime before and the service was good. The manager even looked right at us. Apparently it's more important to wipe tables than attend to diners at night here. I hope somebody from the company reads this comment and the other's bad reviews as well and hopefully take action. The place serves good food but their service really stinks. If you're only gonna provide good service at daytime, then maybe they should just NOT have it open 24 hours if the night staff won't be willing to work at all.",

I gave 2 stars solely because of a great server, Jeremy, who stood out at a location that is typically VERY slow.  I wish I could give more but the kitchen is always slow, the manager can't control stock and all prior visits have taken well over an hour to get a burger.  My family warned me not to order dessert because \"that always takes as long as the time to prepare the dinner order.\"  Again Jeremy was better at this as well but he remains the sole good example of an otherwise poorly run franchise location.",

We waited over 15 minutes with there only being 3 tables of people. This restaurant is always completely disgusting. The parking lot always smells like vomit as well. We went to leave to go take our business elsewhere and passed one of the cooks who was outside getting stoned! The entryway smelled like straight pot! Absolutely repulsive not to mention ILLEGAL! Do not eat here. Period.",

My husband and I waited 10 minutes to be seated while the manager bussed tables despite that there were more than enough clean to have seated us. We ordered a bowl of chili, two orders of fries, and two milkshakes. It took over 35 minutes to be served. There were only 13 customers in the restaurant. The service was awful. I almost feel bad saying that the manager, Jen, has no business working in a management position because she is clearly a hard worker and ... It is just a fast food restaurant. But, if this was my business (it would never have gotten this bad), I would want to know. This manager clearly had no clue how to effectively task her staff, manage her own time, or how to interact with customers. I didn't even bother speaking with her about, it would've been pointless.",

We sat at a table for over 15 minutes w/o a single server coming to take our drink or or anything.  Servers were walking by our table many times and checking on other tables after they were already tended to but would not wait on us. Even when we got up to leave no one seemed to care. We went next door to Board Walk Billies and had WONDERFUL service and great food.  It was so much better than the mess they would of served us at Steak and Shake.

I drove 15m out of the way to get S&S so I decided to walk inside.  Waiting... waiting...oh hey.  I'm interrupted by another customer she says there food took about an hour and was told it was because the ticket was lost, she asked if she could be compensated with a discount. They said the ticket was actually found and she ate the food. Goodbye. They leave. They continue to say how she's Larger and doesn't need to eat those fries anyway or something of that nature. (Red Flag)!   Back to me, I proceed to order adamant for a burger and something light for my friend in the car. I'm told there's almost no food in house in a way it seemed like I was being very \"Inconvenient\" to them, (no eggs, salad, soup, noodles, chili.. etc)  About over 1/3 of the menu. I ask for a burger and a sandwich thankfully they had.  Waiting.... look Around at the trash on the floor, the server drinking a milkshake leaning on the drink machine, boxes and trash in the back, food and shit on most of the tables in the \"closed section\". Just a pathetic seen.  I get my food to go in an average time. (Felt lied to about the drive thru*) just to get me to leave? 8 mins later I open my poorly put together burger that just falls apart, basically mush. *Overcharged for a combo I didn't get by the way*  Fries tasted like they had been having a damn fish fry all day.   I'm surprised that there even in business. Whole staff needs to be either replaced or retrained. Management doesn't seem to give a damn. I hope they close down soon. The Franchise owner needs to do some soul searching or get a different profession so not terrorize the rest of the community with there poor management.  This isn't a complaint, it's a Warning for other Customers. Some drastic changes need to be made at this location.",

Of the last 5 attempted visits, over the last few months...2 times, I was informed that they could not serve food, because not enough employees had shown up for their shift, and 2 other times, I was informed that it would be a 30-minute wait for a burger (with no other guests there)  Worst ran business in America!",

All and all it was a pretty appalling visit to Steak & Shake and I would not recommend this location since my mom walked out with an empty stomach and my sister and I walked out with an unpleasant experience.

It's the first thing you see when you walk in: my entire line of sight was full of trash on the ground it's disgusting! And the servers are standing there in front of the window waiting for things and are too damn lazy to reach down and pick up the trash. I've watched them all walk by or just stay in there over at doing nothing when all I have to do is reach 10 and pick up their damn mess. I ran restaurants for years and yes this is fast food but none of the other fast food restaurants like Zaxby's next-door has trash in their parking lot or in their bushes that I can see. This is bad management. And it Would appear staff Just does not take very much pride in anything they do. I hope they don't keep their homes this way.   Did I not love their jalapeno crunch burger and hotdogs they would not get three stars... Really trashy filthy and I'm watching servers or staff be on their phone sending texts in the beverage area instead of picking up all that garbage under their feet!",

    "text": "We love Steak 'n Shake food but have traditionally experienced poor service, no matter where we were traveling. We we pleasantly surprised to be seated right away, all of the guests had been served and eating and we were greeted by Shikari Adkins shortly after we were seated. We got our food in a timely manner AND our orders were all correct... just as we ordered!!!  Apparently the owner(s) are rectifying all of the problems we read about. Thanks for the great dining experience Shikari!!!",

    "text": "I went here with my little brother because he loves this place. We walked in around 3:40pm so it wasn't busy at all, there was barely anyone there. It took them 10 minutes to get us seated and we weren't even greeted by the hostess or server. A family of five was seated before us and we walked in before them. When we finally got seated the lady threw the menus on the table and didn't tell us who our server was... a couple of moments later someone finally came up to the table took our drink order. We order 2 milkshakes. A couple of minutes later (no milkshakes in her hand) she came back and took our order for our food(both order burgers).   The food came out before the shakes and that took at least 20 minutes. I know it takes a while to cook food but that was a little insane when it wasn't even busy(there were only 3 other tables that were seated out of the restaurant and everyone already had their food). My burger wasn't even hot and I asked our server about our shakes And she didn't say anything. Our shakes finally arrived 25 minutes after we ordered them. Needless to say I won't be back. Don't waste our money at this one. Takes a long time to get what you ordered.",

    "text": "Never place an online order. My 2 burgers were supposed to be ready by 1:46pm. I showed up to the drive thru at that exact time and was told that I have to go inside to pick up my order, which I've never had to do before. I go inside and wait 10 minutes for someone to help me. I tell the person I have an online order and they say that they will begin to make it right away. I explain it should've already been made. They say nothing and walk away. The manager finally gets me my food after seeing me waiting and I show him my online order. I had to wait 20 minutes for food that should have been ready.",

    "text": "I had 1 of the absolute worst experience ever at this location a few months ago! the manager and her asst.. (2 heavyset Caucasian females) were the the absolute rudest!! they apparently became upset with me because I made a gesture at the manager  because as she brought the icecream we ordered to the table, she was observed by me talking OVER the food as she was trying to decide which table to bring it to. I was with 3 kids under the age of 5! I didn't realized the manager had an attitude with me until it was time for me to pay the bill. I asked why was she looking at me in such an aggressive manner.. she replied because \"I am about sick of you and I need you to Pay and get out now!.\" I was totally shocked and said \"how dare you speak to me in that manner and demand money from me\".. she then started threatening to call the cops on us. the kids started crying! I became upset at the tone she was using and asked to speak to her manager.. at this time another heavy set Caucasian woman who stood next to her said..\"I am the manager and she had done nothing wrong, pay your bill and leave the store please\" the 2 of them were talking to me so disrespectful, I was trying to keep a hold of my composure as I was with 3 babies who were pulling me to just leave because they were scared to death after hearing these obnoxious women continue to threaten me with the cops... I told her I was going to pay and as I handed her the slip with what I had ordered  she snatched it along with the money  I had in my hand  and threw it back at me and said leave. I said this is not my receipt, this is the same slip I gave you ( mind you she never rung up my order in the cash register...she said yes it is.. now GO!\" as I was trying my best to stay calm in front if the kids, telling them to not be afraid she said \"I am sick of you\" and started acting as if she was speaking to an officer giving him a description of me. I stated \"ok I will wait outside for the cops to come because  this cannot be happening and I want to speak to the cops too.... sitting near the register there was a dark skin female employee (skinny) sitting down laughing along with the entire crew that was on shift that day. I said to her.. \"wow and your actually laughing thinking its cute for your leaders to react like this\" she responded \"bitch I am not the one don't say shit to me because I am not my manager and youre just mad that shes cursing you out\".... so I walked out and went to my car to wait for the police. the skinny girl ran towards the back and came back with a brown skin rugged looking thugged out guy.. he went to his car and grabbed something and put it in his pants. he started waving saying for me to come on over here (as I stood by my car) he kept saying \"I got something for you!\" they all were laughing through the door.. I got in the car and left because I wasnt sure What he had put in his pants from the car that was parked on the right side of the front entrance... . I called the cops as I drove away and gave them a description of what had happened. I was in tears! I called the cooperate office and gave them the girls names (i cant remember the names now) and my information and a detailed report of what had happened. Cooperate never called me back. it is now months later and just writing this review makes me sick! I will be able to provide the day ..it  was Feb 3, 2019.. it was in the afternoon towards evening...the absolute WORST fast food Experience Ever!!",

    "text": "Came in after a fun night. Table was dirty with ketchup stains. We disregard and asked for it to be clean. Ordered two meals a chicken tender mean with an additional of fries.. well the fries came out when my fiance was actually done her food.  Not to mention we never even received the cookie that came with the meal. And still paid full price. I am absolutely disgusted especially when I watched my fiance fries sit in the window while the waitress spend an indecent amount of time joking around with the table that was in front of us. So I asked the cook to bring my fries. Then on my check out expressed my concerned with did me little to no good. I should have walked out on the fucking tab. This is the first time in history I have never tipped because of the service.",

    "text": "The service was inattentive and slow. I could overlook our bad experience, but the worst part was what happened to another group. A group of 5 people came in- looked to be a mom, teenager and 3 elementary age kids. They came in and missed reading the small sign about waiting for a seat, so they seated themselves at a table. My first jobs were a hostess and server at a restaurant, so I understand that it probably gets annoying having to explain this to people 20 times a day. Well, our server had clearly had enough. He ranted about this to us and proceeded to ignore them. After about 10 minutes, they got up and left. The mom was wearing a hijab and I really hope she didn't misunderstand the incident. The guy wasn't being racist, he was just being an asshole. I would've said something to a manager, but really don't think it would have made a difference.",
