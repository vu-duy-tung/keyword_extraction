Food was plentiful.  Our table got a freebie of teriyaki shrimp (maybe they do this for all tables?).  Our party had the chicken and steak selections, all good.   2 adults and 2 kids. We were out the door for $85, including a nice tip.  Small kids will love the chef act!  Make reservations!  We did and we were glad.",

    "text": "My visit to Nakato (first time) was on a Friday night.  The place was packed and had a constant stream of people, busy busy.  We had 6:30 reservations for a party of 6 and once everyone arrived we were promptly seated.  They will not seat you until everyone is there.  We were seated around a hibachi station - each station has seating for 8, so we had two strangers at the end of our station (no big, they were nice).  I was a little concerned at the cost of the meal when I was looking at it online, but the amount of food is well worth the cost.  I ordered the teryaki chicken.  You start with an onion broth while the chef is warming up.  Next is the small chilled garden salad served with a pink creamy dressing.  While you are finishing your soup and working on your salad, the chef starts with hibachi veggies (thin sliced carrots, onions, zucchini, mushrooms and broccoli).  Next are hibachi noodles (spaghetti with an oil and garlic ? coating).  Next, if you order fried rice with your meal ($1.75 extra) instead of white rice, the chef does the fried rice and portions it out.  Then the meat is started.  Our table had a variety of steak and shrimp items, which were served first since they cook more quickly than chicken (no one wants rare chicken).  I thought everything was quite good (though my white rice was cold, but that is what I get for not ordering fried rice like everyone else at the table).  All of the preparation is done in front of you by the chef, who puts on a show while cooking.  Very interesting, though I was concerned that I was going to lose my eyebrows when the onion volcano was done.  With 6 people, it was hard to hold a conversation, though not impossible.  If you are catching up with friends, I would suggest getting there early for drinks, or planning drinks and dessert after - once the chef's show starts going, along with all of the tables around you, it is rather noisy.    Our server kept drinks filled.  The chef was quite personable.  I had water to drink, so my dinner before tip was just under $15.  Contrary to what my dinner date told me, you don't necessarily have to take off your shoes, though they do have traditional tables there as an option.    Be warned that your hair and clothes will reek of the hibachi smell, so I wouldn't take a post-meal walk through the woods unless you like bears and wildcats.",

He didnt interact with our table at all which in turn led to a more awkward meal. Even with the flaming onion tower that every hibachi place does, he coulndt do that so he just set our whole table on fire ( literally) and just made noises while doing so. It was strange to say the least. Also the portions were extremely small especially for a hibachi restaurant. All in all i was very disappointed in this restaurant, nothing has changed since the remodel i guess.",

All three are great choices that you can't go wrong with.  My favorite parts of the meal are the noodles I think.  They are down right delicious probably from the butter used to cook them.  Don't come here on a diet, you will be in trouble.  Another thing to note is it's probably good to get a reservation because the place stays busy.  But if you don't, don't fret.  We recently did an impromptu visit and even though they stated an hour long wait it was really only 30 minutes.  I think they are just managing expectations.",

I literally had my soup and salad delivered within 30 seconds of each other. Then the chef comes out to rush us. The server is stuck constantly refilling tiny glasses and trying to rush us so we have room for hot food from the chef. The chef was entertaining but the food wasn't very good. Large portions of noodles and vegetables. I guess they want big portions to make up for poor quality. Doesn't work. Then the server comes out to rush us into boxing up our food. The very minute the chef is done! How about we get some time to eat and talk?!? Boxes were left at the table while we were still eating so that The server could return to constantly filling tiny glasses. We wanted to make sure the chef got tipped out, but came to find he splits them with the server... even. That is just wrong. The servers are running around hustling people through dinner so they can get the next table in.    The place cuts too many corners and rushes you through dinner. It's not very good. And they take advantage of the wait staff. Did I mention the hostesses were rude? Find somewhere better to eat.",

    "text": "My husband and I came here on a Wednesday night because we had a Groupon for $30 worth of food.  The Groupon said to call ahead with a reservation and to  mention the Groupon, so at 6pm I called, and was told the earliest they could take me was 7. I thought it was odd being so full on a weeknight, but fine with the time. It seemed like they were really busy because it was hard to talk to the hostess, who seemed in a rush to get off the phone.   We arrived around 10 til 7 and were immediately seated. We were sat (very close to) a group that was already there at another grilling station. We waited on the rest of our people to get there and I actually felt a little smashed between my husband and a 12 year old from another party. I feel like they had 1 too many chairs for the table.   Our waiter was Quinn. He was pretty nice, but I think he had at least 1 other table, because we saw him few and far between. It seemed like the waitress serving the table next to us was a bit quicker, but who knows what was happening behind the scenes.   I ordered the Teryaki steak, and my husband got the Teryaki chicken. It comes with a shrimp appetizer, soup, salad, vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, carrots, and mushrooms), and white rice (you can get an order of fried rice for $1.75 extra).   I thought the shrimp was good, and the chef did a little trick flipping the shrimp tails into a used bowl, one into his pocket, and one into his hat. This was probably the only time he showed off. The chef at the other table flipped around the egg, where as our chef cracked them on the grill. The other chef, just seemed like he was having a fun time with it, our chef seemed not thrilled.   The steak and vegetables, noodles, and rice were all good. Not great, I think if we were paying full price for this, I would have not enjoyed our $40 bill. We did also try Saki for the first time (not a fan).   We will go back - if we have another Groupon or coupon.",

    "text": "Very busy place for rather mediocre food. We rarely eat at hibachi grills, but decided it sounded good tonight. The food was okay. Life's too short and there are way too many good things to eat to settle for okay!  I think one thing that makes it tricky when reviewing a hibachi experience is that they all basically have the same menu - right down to the salad dressing!  Therefore, comparisons are natural.   I found the soup salty. The salad dressing was okay, but missing something. Rice was good, noodles had a nice garlic flavor and veggies were standard. I ordered the teriyaki steak and it had zero teriyaki flavor. Had the sauce not been visible I would have sworn I got the wrong item. The meat itself did not taste good. It wasn't spoiled tasting, more like a really cheap cut of meat. I only ate about three bites.  In another environment I would have gone so far as to complain, but not here.  The shrimp were good. Maybe most disappointing was the ubitiqous white shrimp sauce. It was very watery and bland:(. Major disappointment as that stuff is the highlight of a hibachi visit!  In sum, the food was filling, but not good enough to come here again.    The positives are that the staff were friendly and worked quickly. The chef gave extra attention to my young son which was kind of him. Portions were quite large.  I cannot imagine complaints about portion size!",

    "text": "One of my familiy's favorite places to eat. Ever. Armed with this knowledge I was bracing myself for an... interesting experience. Hibachi is generally standard across the board for me. It's not a hit or miss type of cuisine. In terms of the actual hibachi, everyone does the same exact thing with some minor twists here and there, so it's all about the quality of ingredients and service. Lets just say I held my toungue when asked how I liked my meal at the end of the day.  The Service: - A little slow honestly, it took them forever to get my beer (not cool bro) and even longer to come get my order. Friendly people as per the usual, but for some reason they are on asian standard time when it comes to serving you.  The Food: - Standard hibachi food, solid but nothing special. A big plus for me are the portions. They tend to give you larger portions than other restaurants along with the traditional soup, salad, shrimp, and veggies. In fact, this is the only place I've seen that gives you noodles with your dish at no extra cost. Well played Nakato.   The Ambiance - Gotta love the ambiance. My cook was playful and had fun with the kids (which is a must, they love attention). The decor was great, modern with a little rustic feel to make you ease into your surroundings.   Overall, wouldn't jump the gun saying its the best hibachi I've ever had, but I also won't be coming here regularly.",

The sushi is outstanding and the service is always perfect. I've eaten there so many times I cannot count, but I have never had a bad experience in over 20 years of  eating at this restaurant. This is absolutely one of my favorite places because I know how careful they are with their food preparation and the fact that the place is spotless, and exceptionally good service. By the way I always check the bathrooms before I actually sit down to eat in a place, and their bathrooms would get an A rating from me.",

In comparison to other hibachi restaurants nearby, the entree prices were definitely pricier. Word to the wise: entrees comes with steamed rice, but fried rice is an extra charge... which I've never seen a hibachi place do. Our server was very kind and attentive, and our chef was personable and engaging, but overall, I didnt feel the food was worth the price.",

You can get steamed white rice included with the meal. Generally it's the fried rice included but nope. Don't be surprised when your bill is $1.85 more than you expected. 2. Our chef threw his utensil across the table in the first 3 mins of his cooking. -__- 3. I told him I'd like to not have noodles. He said, \"you still have to pay for it.\" -I know sir. 4. When flipping the chicken, he threw a whole tender sized piece onto the table. Just left it there...didn't get another piece. Too bad to the folks getting chicken. You're just short. 5. Luckily I got shrimp. It was extremely dry, unluckily.   My table's experience was bad. Hopefully it was just an off night, but I won't be going back.",

    "text": "My partner and I just left Outback right across the street due to a horrible experience before we even ordered so we decided to tryout Nakato.  We were immediately sat at the sushi bar because it was an hour wait to sit at a hibachi family style table where the chef cooks in front of you.    We were greeted in a timely manner, drink orders taken and drinks received timely.  Sushi was ordered then waitress disappears. I see the manager running around like a chicken with his head cut off to only further observe the employees he hired and is paying are standing  around and literally flickering their lighters, yes one server was literally standing around flicking a lighter.    We finally get the sushi, the I asked to order the filet and jumbo prawn for my partner and I, each.  (Mind you it's the most expensive for the combo per person, for the items listed at $28 a piece)  The server argued with me that they didn't have it. I pulled out the menu and pointed. I think there was a language barrier. Next, I tell her what kind of soup and salad I want, as the entrees are supposed to come with soup ,salad, shrimp appetizer, everything you would get as if you sat at a table where the cooks actually cooking front of you.  She said if we want the soup, salad etc we would have to sit at the table where they cook In front of you. I asked what else came with it then, she said nothing only rice and meat.    Soooooooo, for the same menu item, same price you are not giving us the same accompaniments that would you would get normally because we are sitting at the sushi bar? Ridiculous.  I said bring the bill for the sushi and we are outta here.  It took another 15 minutes to get out bill which I had to flag the manager down for.  Never will we return.  This was the second restaurant the tried for my partners 30th birthday.",

We've been to both Nakato and Kabuto and both are good, but Nakato stands out a bit more for us so that's what we decided on.  We arrived at 5pm on a Sunday night and didn't expect much of a wait so imagine our surprise when the waiting area was full and they said it was a 45 minute wait.  Oh well, it was what it was AND it was my son's bday so we waiting...and waited....and waited.  Finally, after 50 long minutes, they called our name.    We were seated in the \"traditional\" teppanyaki room and that was a first for us.  We loved it!  It was a bit awkward to get into, but worth it.  I've been trying to watch my weight so instead of the massive feeding frenzy of the traditional hibachi meal,. I had a bowl of the Onion Soup, a side of Edammame and the Tuna Tataki appetizer (portion was entree-sized!).  All of it was very good!  My family had the steak and chicken hibachi meals and loved it all.  My son especially loves the \"Yum Yum\" sauce (the pink sauce) and has me convinced that he would eat \"anything\" if he could dip it in Yum Yum sauce!    We opted for the $10.00 birthday package.  The package included a birthday cake (Pepperidge Farms vanilla cake) with a candle, a family photo in a souvenir cardboard frame (came out awesome, BTW), and the waitstaff sang Happy Birthday in English and Japanese.  Well worth the $10, in my opinion!",

Not sure who the sushi chef was but he definitely knew what he was doing. After sitting at the sushi bar for a while we went to the Hibachi area for the rest of our meal.

The bar is located in the front (aka the waiting room because lots of large parties come in). They have tables, traditional Hibachi rooms and large tables with the same Hibachi grill. It might be chilly once you walk in, but the flat top heats you up. I went with the family for my grandmother's birthday and we got hibachi meals.  FOOD: You start with some soup, which to me was delicious but to most is probably just salty water with some onions. They also give a small salad. Next up is whatever you want! Each protein is served with veggies, noodles and rice (steamed or fried). Everyone gets some soy sauce and shrimp sauce as well. Seafood, steak or chicken are the main protein choices. I also noticed it's super easy to ask for no butter or oil in your meal so it's very easy to request a low sodium, low fat healthy meal. It was my grandmother's birthday so we got a cake that comes with a very loud sound and painfully american Japanese version of \"if you're happy and you know it.\" Is it just a vanilla cake with some sprinkles? Yeah. Is it amazing and fluffy and light and worth saving room for? Absolutely. You also get a cute picture to take home.  The chefs' talent is really what makes the whole experience. They will interact with who interacts with them. So, please, put the phone down and enjoy the onion volcano they set on fire. It's fun and definitely makes a birthday special.",

We ask to talk to the manager and I never, ever had a manager talking to me like that... my husband walked away from the restaurant and my family and I got a table. How rude this man was to us. The manager also want to dictate on what chair we should be seating... really? NO. I will be seating in front of the grill and you put whoever you want on the side table. He said that I should leave if I was not compliant with the restaurant rules... Serious? who is the owner of this restaurant? I don't think they have a clue what is going on there. They laugh on my face and treat my family and  I as crap. Food is good , but they lost easily a family of 6. Something has to change with the front desk people. Specially the manager that has no clue how to treat a customer. My kids cried and got scared with the manager attitude. Not fair and not acceptable.",

The soup was fantastic, rich and so flavorful.  My husband had steak and scallops, he said it was delicious.  I had the filet steak and shrimp.  The filet was cooked perfectly and was as tender as any steak I've had at a high end steakhouse.  I don't know what they do with their noodles...but they were the best I've ever had.  There was a bit of a wait to be seated, as was expected for a Saturday night and without a reservation.  We enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar and the wait was definitely worth it.

Food is sub-par but you pay too much for the food they serve  My advice : avoid it and find some place where they care about you as a customer",

I arrived early and sat at the bar. The bartender and hostess staff is quite helpful.  Our group was seated at one of the hibachi grills. Our server was nice but she was a bit slow and a bit off with some of orders but I think she corrected all but one issue.  Your meal comes with soup, salad and then your entree which is cooked in stages. Everyone gets 2 pieces of shrimp to start off. Then you get your veggies and rice, and then the proteins. The hibachi chef puts on a great show for you from balancing and egg on his spatula to creating a fire in front of you.  The food was great and it's worth the entertainment you receive. On my next visit I want to try the sushi bar where there are boats that circle a bar where you can select your sushi. Sounds like fun.",

And I don't mean one tiny vein in one shrimp - every piece of shrimp had a large vein running right through it, very prominently visible. It was horrible, not to mention we could've been really sick if we hadn't noticed it. The manager was nice enough to give us more chicken to replace the shrimp and also gave us a few $ off, but that does compensate for their negligence in deveining the shrimp. Also, the zucchini was over cooked, and the rest of the food was mediocre. If you want the hibachi grill experience, this is a great place! If you want good food along with it, not so much.",

I got the shrimp & chicken, the chicken was actually both seasoned and cooked very well (not over cooked and dry) - the shrimp however had so little taste that when I shared with my 4 year old she said, \"is that real food, or are you pretendin'?\"  I said, \"yes - why?\"... her reply, \"because it doesn't taste like anything!!\".   The soup was extra good, the salad average at best (I make a much better ginger dressing)!!!   My daughter said the noodles were good but she also thinks McDonald's nuggets are good......  My wife got steak (strip) and I tried it and it was pretty good...   ALL portion sizes were tiny (except the shrimp appetizer- it was the normal 2 shrimp)..  I was here for a birthday dinner - and sort of glad I came - it reinforces to me that Tsuki is 10x better at minimum -food quality, taste, portion size and price (no nickel & diming)...",

This review is mostly for the sushi - which I've definitely had better for the price. I got the hot lava roll, the hope roll, and the dragon roll. The hot lava roll was described to have scallops on top, but I couldn't taste the scallops or really anything on or inside the roll because it was drenched, and I mean drenched in mayo sauce. And this was at least $13... just no. The dragon roll came with only 4 pieces? Not sure if that was a mistake or just my fault not reading the menu. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong things but I wouldn't come here again for sushi. The hibachi looked good; the chefs are talented and put on a semi-entertaining show. However to be priced at almost 20 dollars... it's not that much food. Service was fine. But overall not worth it for me.",

The restaurant policy is a party could not be sat unless all members are present. However my daughter was less than 5 minutes away. Fortunately the manager made an exception for us. Lizzie needs to be fired or moved to be a dishwasher. She is not the right person in that position as hostess. Great manager. Great waitress. Great chef. Terrible hostess for refusing a customer. Did she not learn what customer service is?",

My husband and I shared the Hope, Volcano, 49er and caterpillar rolls and they were all so fresh and flavorful. The sushi chef Chris was super friendly and definitely an added bonus to talk to while at the bar. We will be back for sushi for sure and probably try the hibachi at some point.",

Our server was nice and the cook made sure our orders were correct and had the server bring more shrimp as soon as he realized that there was small mix-up.   Also, if you're a fan of sake and/or have never tried and don't want to break the bank, they offer $4 Gekkeikan served warm/cold. As with any hibachi, the price per plate is going to be around the $20 range but it's well worth it, considering how much food you receive.   The only drawback, the closeness of the table to the grill and all the smoke (if sitting right in front of the chef) will have your clothes smelling like food afterwards. But being the fat kid that I am... I take it (lol)!   Definitely coming back!",

We ate about half and had enough for another entire meal as leftovers! I would definitely come here again for hibachi!",

    "text": "Tonight was a very interesting dining experience. Once I took my seat, the waiter was very kind and polite. While waiting for the chef, I was able to learn a lot about the girl sitting next me. Not because I asked her, but because she talked so loud to the person sitting right beside her.  I found out she is an Ardrey Kell Senior, who does not have a date to Sadie's. She has no idea what to do because her best friend cannot go with just her. She did not fail to mention that one of her other \"friends\" is worried about going to college next year, because she won't apply to any scholarships but does not want her parents to pay for it all, even though they just bought two brand new Mercedes Benz, for a total of 5 cars in their garage. I was also delighted to know she enjoys drinking sprite with a little bit of tequila on the weekends.  Our chef did minimal tricks, but the food was fulfilling. However, the MVP of the night was our waiter. Through all the unnecessary information I heard tonight, he managed to be the most attentive server at a Japanese steakhouse that I have ever had.  The night ended with the 17 year old tequila drinker, bumping into my legs, and instead of her saying sorry, she simply walked away. Perhaps if she wasn't so rude, she could find a Sadie's date .  I give this review a 5/5 simply off our waiter Matt. Thank you for making my least favorite experience at a steakhouse, something worth reviewing.",

    "text": "Lesson learned. DO NOT SIT AT THE SUSHI BAR if you are getting food from the grill. This was an impromptu celebration night for us when we decided to go to one of our favorite places but the wait for 2 was an hour and a half. We talked for a second and decided to sit at the sushi bar instead and just order from there. What they don't tell you is that you get half the food if you order there than you would if you sat at one of the regular tables..for $2 less. Not happy that we paid $12 for something I could have gotten for $7 at any other quick Japanese place.   The waitress we had was rude and short. I get that they were busy but they are always crazy busy on the weekend and I've seen her there for years so I know she is accustomed to that. I don't appreciate being told no when we ask for something extra and say we know there is a charge. Because of a diet program, we wanted all vegetables instead of rice and said we knew there would be a charge but she flat out said \"no we don't do that\"...you don't do what, make money on your food? After she said that she turned around and walked away when I was still talking. She dropped off our cold food 30 minutes later and then our check 20 minutes after that. Not once did she check on us.  On top of the terrible service and value, our vegetables weren't cooked and the entirety of our meal was cool to the touch. It will be a very long time before we go back and never again will we sit there, nor will we have her as a waitress. So upset that we wasted our \"cheat\" meal on such a bad experience!  The sushi chef, however, was amazing and so friendly. He was the only bright spot in our meal.",

Our server, Jonathan, was great from the start making sure we got our drinks in immediately & that my son was taken care of. Soup and salad was brought out promptly, and the chef came to the table about 15 mins after. Danny was great, he was funny and interacted with everyone. The food was great and we both had two full Togo boxes to take home- which made for a good lunch today! It wasn't that expensive compared to most Hibachi style restaurants and the quality was outstanding. Will definitely make this a more regular thing!",

    "text": "It's been awhile since I wrote about my favorite Japanese dinning place.  In my opinion this place has it as the \"Best of Charlotte \" for Japanese food hands down!   The food is delicious every single time ! Portions are huge ! The entertainment is included and most times very fun ! Occasionally you'll get a chef who isn't too interactive but for the most part they'll engage you in a fun and entertaining dinner.   My go to favorite is the hibachi shrimp and recently I've become a fan of scallops! They do not disappoint!   The steak is always tender and flavorful! I recommend going for the filet as it is fabulous!   A delicious salad and a hot cup of onion soup start the experience and it's followed by a couple of shrimp appetizers to tease you !  The real deal is the fried rice ! It is yummy!  The chefs are very accommodating for those of you who don't want carbs .... simply let them know and it's more  for folks like me who go there for that yummy fried rice !  There's also a sushi bar if hibachi is not your thing. Fresh sushi is made each day and the chefs at the sushi bar are spot on fabulous!   Nakatos has been in Charlotte serving this delicious hibachi food since sometime in the 1980's.  I use to drive to their location off Independence Blvd back in the day.   So glad they moved ! But honestly it's worth the drive no matter where they go !  There's usually a short wait but they do take reservations!  If you have a group you'll get a whole table to yourselves and the experience is always great !   Check it out ! Sometimes if you watch your mail there's a coupon for 14.00 off a dinner of equal value!  If you've haven't been to Nakatos you're missing out on a fabulous find ! Two thumbs way up!!!",

The chef keeps the kids entertained and the food is good. I really like the dragon roll and we usually get edamame for the kids. Another great reason to go on Thursday is the early bird special. You get chicken and steak for a much cheaper price than on the weekend. I also order the spicy mustard sauce for my steak and sriracha for my shrimp. I recommend the fried rice over the white.",

We opted for Nakatos and it was a good choice.  We seemed to feel the food was a bit better tasting.  For example,  the fried rice is prepared with 5 eggs which seems to be a lot more.  The noodles tasted fresher and the meats were well prepared and seasoned.   The appetizer soup was great as it had bits of fried tempura coating in it.  Overall great tasting food (5/5).  Plus you can sit at tables that are traditional as you have to take your shoes off which is cool (5/5). Overall great experience,  highly recommend you give this place a whirl of you're in the area.",

Also years ago the hosts would dress nice and set a tone of a nice restaurant.

    "text": "I went to this place with my family on a Friday night and it was packed!  We were allowed to be seated faster if we decided Traditional Dining (basically sitting without your shoes).  Although it was interesting, I would probably not do it again.  I do not want to even know what my socks touched on those floors (even though the restaurant appeared pretty clean).    As far service, the waitress was nice and the chef was entertaining (pretty much the same as other Japanese restaurants).  As far as food, it was quite disappointing.  The soup was pretty good, but the salad was pretty bland, I didn't even finish it.  For the main course, I ordered the chicken and the NY strip steak.  When I saw the food right before it was going to be cooked, I could clearly see that food quality appeared sub-par.  The steaks were thin and were not that tasty, especially when I had mine cooked medium-rare.  The chicken was alright along with the rice and vegetables, but it was not memorable.    Overall, this Japanese restaurant was alright.  It's serves its purpose if you are craving Japanese food and do not want to drive far, but it is definitely not a place to go if you want to impress someone.",

    "text": "We came in just for sushi and, while I know their main feature is the hibachi grill-style cooking, they also advertise themselves as a \"sushi bar\" in huge letters on their building. If you promote yourself as a sushi establishment, the product should be of decent quality.  Red flag #1 was the fact there were only 3 total rolls sitting on the 20 or so sushi boats.  They had a separate sushi menu, so it was fine... just odd for this type of sushi bar.  We know sushi/sashimi very well and their fish was NOT fresh, at all.  It borderline smelled fishy and it was pretty mushy.  It hadn't gone bad... yet.  But it was almost there.  Further, spicy tuna should be diced with some texture, not a paste.  It was gross.  My husband was so grossed out he stopped eating after trying only one or two bites of each roll. He has never refused to eat sushi in the 18 years we have eaten sushi together. This was a first.  On the upside, the food is very reasonably-priced and the staff was pleasant and attentive.  That is the only reason I gave 2 stars instead of just 1.  Unfortunately, we will not be back.",

Nancy, the hostess, reminded us 5 times during our hour and 25 minute wait the \"you were a walk in\". Apparently you can walk into the parking lot, call in a reservation, and will be seated before a low life walk in. The nerve of someone thinking it's ok to just walk in, give your name and expect any form of decent customer service. Finally after waiting an shout and 25 minutes, watching walk ins who just arrived 10 minutes earlier be seated, we decided Kabutos, just 1/2 a mile South should have been where we went in the first place. Went there and we were greeted with a smile and someone who was excited to have our business. Dinner was fantastic!skip Nakatos and go straight to Kabutos",

In came a platter with 12 one-inch cubes of steak with no seasoning, no teriyaki sauce, no sauce of any kind. It came with a mound of rice--that was very tasty--but no veggies. And all this plethora of food was $16. Very disappointed that the food is average, beginner chef stuff. Nakato in Pineville needs to take their food to the next level and offer flavor with every bite. Include savory, in-season, seasoned veggies with all meals to help the customer feel they have gotten their money's worth when they pay $16 for a meal. I ended up bringing it home, adding onions, green/yellow squash, and sliced carrots, along with some Chinese teriyaki sauce with a shake of red pepper. Voila.",

We always give places more than one shot, especially if their food is good...but every time we go we are so disappointed at the service!  The chefs are nice and entertaining, especially for kids, but their servers don't seem to care and ruin the tip (which they split)  This last time, we went on a Friday round 6. Moderately busy, but seated right away. Our server seemed so bothered by us, never saying you're welcome when we thanked it (it was more if a grunt/irritated \"ya\") and the portions were much smaller. I swear, the more people at a table, the smaller the portion. If you get served last, expect to be jealous of the first persons huge serving.   They charged an extra $1.75 for fried rice, which I don't mind but I do expect more than 2 pieces of broccoli, one mushroom and a decent amount of zucchini and onion. My chicken dinner cost around $16, and the best part was the Shrimp sauce,    They served my husbands combo with teryaki chicken instead of regular hibachi and when he told them it was wrong twice, our chef pretended not to hear and turned the fan on. We were so annoyed at that point, we didn't push the issue...paid our $50 tab and bolted.   Won't be returning. Given this place too many opportunities and they constantly fail.",
