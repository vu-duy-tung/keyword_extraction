They had great drink specials ($3.50 margaritas, $2.50 beers), and we loved the chips and salsa.  The Queso, however was so salty and watery.  We should have returned it immediately but we were all pretty hungry.  I got the Try 3 - with the fish taco being my favorite.  I was surprised at the tiny tostado.  Hubby got the steak burrito, and while it was huge, the steak itself was pretty chewy and the flavor was boring, too.  I'd return to Don Pedro's or Azteca or any one of the local Mexican eateries next time.",

If you like to see feces, overflowing toilets (all of them) and wet, nasty, floors and sinks. Ran out of there, told my hubby let's go. It took 15 minutes for him to pay for the overpriced beer. It wasn't busy. Never going back, unless we feel like having a bowl of e-coli or hepatitis. Found a better, clean place after that unpleasant experience. Wonder if the staff washes their hands. Doesn't matter - never going back.",

They came with a slaw like topping (cabbages and carrots) and tomatoes. I'm allergic to carrots and tomatoes.  The gluten free menu and no descriptions (my fault for not asking) so I just picked them off. My complaint about the tacos were that they were ice cold, dry, and honestly tasted how I imagine an armpit would taste. I had 1 bite and couldn't finish.  Our waitress comes back, clearly sees that I haven't eaten and doesn't ask if everything is OK.  Usually if a customer comes in and only has 1 bite of the meal and doesn't get a to-go box SOMETHING is wrong. She seemed like she didn't care about it at all. The margarita pitcher was weak again. We stopped at the grocery store after dinner so I  could actually eat. After this we are definitely NOT coming back here again.",

The sauce was incredibly awful. The waitress was terrific. She checked on me to ask how I liked the entree. I told I really didn't like it at all. She looked at the spinach enchilada and said,\"That is terrible.\"  She insisted on getting me something different. There was literally one tiny bite of spinach and the rest was just corn tortilla.  She ended up bringing me a taco salad.  It was OK.  What is interesting is I believe it was a manager that brought me my food and I asked him, what is this that I ordered? I opened up the enchilada and he had to see that my enchilada was just a corn tortilla.  He just kept on walking.  I won't stop in here again.  Again the waitress was terrific.",

    "text": "On The Border saved my sanity (and someone's life).  That's right, folks.  You read it here first.  Picture it:  Charlotte in December.  It was a Friday night.  I got out of work, got stuck in ignorant holiday traffic, but finally made it home...about 30 minutes late.   Working a 2nd job and taking a night class, this was my one free night to relax and have a nice meal out.  I changed quickly and we were out the door, heading to PF Chang's.  Cut to: the power-tripping hostess who didn't want to seat our party of 5 at one of their empty tables.  (See PF Chang's review for details on that \"fun\" episode.)  We left and headed toward what we thought would be a slower part of town.  We got stuck in more ignorant holiday traffic and what should have been a 15 minute drive turned out to be about an hour.  It was really turning out to be a great night.  We finally reached a shopping plaza where there was a Macaroni Grille.  We decided to pull in.  An hour wait.  I ran next door to On The Border.  It, too, was supercrowded.  \"We can seat you right away,\" said the hostess.  Really?  Heck, yeah!  Mexican it is!   And we WERE seated right away.    The restaurant was supercrowded in the dining room, but somehow we lucked out.  Our cheerful server came immediately to our table, brought mucho chips and salsa, and took our drink orders.  After the way the evening had gone so far, mama needed some margarita.  The chips were gone in no time and we were immediately brought more.   With my Enchiladas Suizas (chicken and cheese enchiladas covered with green, sweet tomatillo sauce) came Margarita #2.  We were SO pleased with the food and service that we left a nice, fat tip.  Happy holidays to him!  After this exceptional experience, you may be asking yourself, \"Why did he only give On The Border four stars instead of five?\"  And my answer would be because I consider Cantina 1511 a five-star Mexican restaurant and On The Border a four-star.  On The Border's salsa and entree options can't compare to Cantina's gourmet take on Mexican.   They're good...but they're no Cantina.    So now you see why On The Border saved my sanity (and possibly someone's life).  The End.",

I look around and there were already several families waiting, and over half the restaurant was empty tables because they are severely understaffed and just not seating most of the restaurant. I asked what the wait for a table was and the hostess says \"I don't really know exactly...\" Just as her manager walks up and loudly whispers, \"just tell people 20 minutes.\"   When we decided that we would wait for a table the hostess hands us our buzzer and says, \"just let me know if you change your mind, and ill erase you from our list.\" As if to try and convince us not to stay. My fiance and I just looked at each other, handed back the buzzer and left.    I have been here and the food was decent, but the service has always been horrible, and something tells me there is a reason they only have 4 people serving a half empty restaurant.    I'm not one to write a bad review either, actually I don't know that I've ever written a bad review, or any reviews for that matter.  This experience just irritated me enough to get back on yelp and let others know to go somewhere else.",

I am fully aware that I am the opposite of what would be considered cool or hip.    Knowing that I am going to spend the rest of my life alone in a house full of cats, I decided that if I wanted to enjoy the occasions that I get to eat out, I need to learn how to do it alone.  I had a coupon for free queso and a gift card with about $15 left on it, so let's get some Mexican for lunch.  Armed with my smart phone and my handy dandy Kindle Fire, I headed approximately 500 yards from my apartment for an early lunch at the bar at On the Border.   Located at the Promenade on Providence shopping center with a prime corner lot next to Macaroni Grill (both part of the Chili's restaurant group, which is what I had the gift card for), parking was easy on this beautiful Friday at 11:30 am, but I imagine on the weekends, this place fills up quick... parking should still be ample and well lit though.    I was greeted upon walking in and when I said I was alone and didn't need to sit in the dining room I was pointed to the bar area, where I was immediately greeted by Grant, the friendly bartender.  He got my drink order, which he quickly came back with along with a basket of chips and some of their house salsa.  I was given some time to look at the menu, order my coupon'ed queso and the brisket soft tacos with a side of black beans and rice.    The food: Tortilla chips - warm, not overly salty.  Held up well for dipping in both the salsa and the queso. House salsa - slight kick, but it's more of an after-burn.  It was not overly cilantro'ed which for me was AWESOME as I hate cilantro.  Tasted fresh-ish and I thought it was quite good. White queso - white cheese served with pico on top.  Queso was cheesy and creamy.  Grant the bartender said that the yellow queso had a bit more of a kick to it, I found the white to be quite mild and delicious. Brisket soft tacos served with rice and black beans - Black beans were fine, not overly spicy, so that was good.  Rice was kind of... well, rice, with corn in it.  Not overwhelming and good enough.  I found the brisket soft tacos to be pretty darn good.  (tortilla, brisket, cheese, topped with crispy onion rings which were thin and crunchy).  The brisket wasn't something I would find in a BBQ restaurant, but for a mexican restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor.    My Diet Coke was kept full at all times and Grant packed up my remaining queso (he said it heats up well) with another container of the salsa and some more chips.  I had a great lunch, service and food, and will definitely return to On the Border.",

So, we decided one afternoon to try this place in hopes of adding a new restaurant to our favorites list. Wrong...the service was distasteful. The waitress was upset at my husband for returning his food because he did not like it. It's not like he ate it and was trying to get out of a bill. He legitimately took one bite and was done. I then took a bite of my tacos and was displeased but continue to eat them because I was hungry. However, I told my husband not to force himself to eat the food and to return it for something else or nothing at all. He proceeds to return the food for nothing at all and the waitress immediately caught an attitude. We asked that she no longer wait our table and requested to speak with the manager. The manager then came to speak with us, apologized for the issue and introduced us to our new waiter who was AMAZING! We ended up leaving the new waitress a $40.00 tip and thanked her. The reason for the three stars and not five is because the food was not that good and the first waitress we had was horrible. I'm probably not going back and I hope that the first waitress got her act together.",

Greenville was fantastic in every way. Providence Rd in Charlotte was a fiasco from start to finish. We didn't get chips and salsa when seated. It took forever to receive sour cream that we'd asked to go along with them. The waitress failed to bring my husband's salad until after his main course when we reminded her. She dropped my tortillas for the fajitas and I didn't receive replacements until after she helped two other tables and the steak was cold. The steak was a small amount of stringy, dried-up, gray pieces of meat on a cold plate whereas in G'ville it was a generous serving of thick strips of medium rare meat sizzling on a hot to the touch one.  We had to ask and wait for refills on drinks.  When we finally were able to pay the bill, with apologizes for the service, she then forgot to return my husband's credit card and had to go hunt for it saying she found it on the floor. I love On The Border and we do not have one in our home town but sadly we will never visit this location, that we do pass from time to time, again.",

The menu has alot of tex mex favorites, and then some crap that's trying to be new and exciting but fails. We tried the queso and was pleased with it (hard to ruin gooey cheese, si?) but the fajitas my date ordered came out with 0 sizzle and all the wrong condiments (no guac, double sour cream instead of requested opposite). I had a salad with a jalepeno vinagerette and it was OK - I know it had chicken in it and came in a large tortilla bowl but nothing else so I think that says how memorable it was.

It's really sad how far this place has slipped since the last time we visited, and this is not just a one time fluke. You can tell they have made choices as a company to go with cheaper ingredients among other strategies to pinch on profits. The salsa definitely changed for the worse, chicken dishes seemed more \"prepared\" or packaged. Even the salad I had was just really bad, it's lettuce with taco stuff = hard to make that bad I would think. We had fajitas with uncooked (literally cold) peppers and onions to the point where you could hold the fajita pan when served. We had a hair in the food. And to top it off, my Mom ordered a side salad she was told would be .99 extra that never showed up on the table but did show up on the bill for $4.99. When told, the waitress said, \"oh yeah, I couldn't get it to ring up at .99 and my Mgr. told me we would comp something later.\" They ended up taking $3 off the cost of the salad (that never came) so we paid $1.99 for the salad.....that never came. LOL",

The last 3 times we have been there the service has gone down hill in a big way. All 3 times our order was messed up and on one occasion they actually lost our order. We waited for over an hour before they came out and told us they couldn't find our order. That was the last straw.  I don't know if it is a change of management but we will not be going back. Too bad because it is really convenient.",

    "text": "9 times out of 10, when faced with a choice of restuarants, I prefer locally owned joints over chains. This place is a good reminder of why that is.   We ended up going here because someone had given us a gift certificate.   So, we stopped in for a late lunch - we arrived well after  the \"busy\" time.   We thought we'd have quick, attentive service, but that was not quite the case.  Our server was friendly, but rather slow in getting drinks out to us & taking our order.   I decided to go simple and have a chicken burrito with rice & beans.  The food tasted ok but was not what I would consider to be particularly good. It was just meh. I can definitely make better chicken burritos with beans & rice at home.    But the worst part was about an hour after eating here, I started to feel yucky.  I was not \"sick-sick\" but felt as if I had eaten too much of something that I am senstive to - like too much MSG .   I think that most fast food and big corporate chains use some MSG in their food but I try to avoid the ones that use way too much of it.  (The problem is that it doesn't always show up in an ingredient list as MSG - sometimes it is just labled as \"natural flavorings\" or  something to that effect).  While a little bit of this stuff is not generally problematic for me, I do find that  when places use too much, that's when I notice the icky feeling.    Places like Applebees, Chilis, On The Border, etc  often use chicken (and other ingredients) that have been seasoned at a central plant, then frozen, and shipped out to the individual locations... these flavorings that are mass-produced are more likely to have too much stuff like MSG in it to try & make it taste better when it is ultimately cooked up & served to the consumer.    Honestly,  there are way too many other good places to eat in this area for me to choose to go back here.  If I end up getting another gift card for  here in the future, I think I'll re-gift it to some one who would better appreciate it.  Next time I have a craving for Mexican when I am close to home, I'll head over to Maria Bonita (Rea/Colony Rd),  Senor Tequila (Piper Glen), or Cabo's (Carmel/51).",

    "text": "Tucked in Promenade next door to the Macaroni Grille is On the Border Cantina.  It's a pretty typical Mexican place with a predictable menu.    The decor is pretty cheesy with over-done Mexican theming throughout.  It really feels like some corporate big-wig in Chicago said, \"If it's stereotypical Mexican, it's for us!\"  The bright colored tiles, clay colored flooring, really is eye-roll worthy.  The staff was fine, and the drink specials they have are worth checking out.  $2 draft beers, and $3 house margaritas?  definitely the best feature.  Several patrons obviously had figured this out as the bar area had a little micro crowd of folks taking advantage of cheap booze and free chips and salsa.  The food unfortunately, is nothing to write home about and left our entire table with a brick in our stomachs for the rest of the evening.  The chips aren't fresh, and taste blah, my pork tacos, which were the special so they had to be fresh, right?  RIGHT??? were average at best.  They were topped with some sort of chili and supposedly some roasted corn and other veg... I had maybe 3 kernels of corn on each taco, and the chili stuff on top seemed awfully like it had been frozen at some point - it was very visually unappealing, bland, and flat-out disappointing.  Overall, this place is a step above a Taco Bell and should change its name to Mexican Applebees.",

And, I wish it landed the other way after lunch today. I arrived shortly after 12 and was greeted at the door at which time I said seating for 1 and the server pointed me to the booths in the bar & said \"There should be a menu on the table\". Okay, so I seated myself and was approached by Matthew, the waiter with no personality. I ordered my drink and was brought chips and salsa. The chips were cold, and very hard. The salsa was decent, however I had to add salt to both, very bland.  I decided to order the lunch chicken fajitas, my staple item to test Mexican restaurants.   After waiting over 25 minutes my food arrived, with a little bit of a smell & a look of fajitas right out of a frozen bag. The chicken was decent, but I think I make chicken better. The peppers and onions were pretty raw, so I decided to press them on the sizzling grill, hoping to cook them a little more. As for the rice & beans, disgusting, both! Refried beans should be mashed, these were like charro beans, ugh! And, the rice, cold and bland. As for the tortillas, very doughy and the cheese came right our of a package.  The ultimate disappointment! I will definitely stick with the non-chain Mexican restaurants. They continue to remain traditional and serve nothing bland, out of a bag... Not saying that On The Border does, but it sure tasted like they do.",

Our chips and salsa took a while to come out, but once it did it's fresh. Everyone at the table gets their own cup of salsa, which for me is a nice thing. Most recently I got the shrimp fajitas. Although a little oily, it had good flavor. I wish the veggies would have been a little more cooked, but overall it had good taste. For $16 it comes with beans, rice, and tortillas.

She told us that she was actually serving the other side of the restaurant but she wanted us to be served. She treated us like royalty until we left that door. She even gave us free dessert!

We ordered the 3 sauce fajita ck burrito for my son and told the waiter to please please please do not include any cheese for this meal we were ordering it to go. Well when we got it who would have guessed ,it had cheese on it.  I was a bit annoyed because we had been there for sometime and wanted to go home so we had to wait again for another meal to be remade.  When it did come the manager Sean Puhl apologized but didn't offer to take anything off the bill for our inconvenience.  It may be sometime before we go back here with so many options to dine in the area. To Sean Puhl and management make it right to your customers, never assume we have to eat here.",

That being said, my expectations may have been too high coming here.   - The atmosphere was great. The decor made the place really come alive (very similar to many restaurants in Charlotte). You feel like you are in Mexico.  - Sauce is solid, honestly nothing to rave about but it gets the job done.  - The entree's are just really bland.  1) My cousins enchiladas came out cold 2) My enchiladas were just bland 3) Nobody on our table (10+ people) came close to eating their food because it just lacked flavor.   Honestly, I wouldn't come back here unless someone really wanted to go here and I had no choice. The positive is the staff is friendly and the place is nice.",

We also ordered their Signature Queso, both yellow and white. They are a bit too salty and too rich for me but in moderation, they are pretty tasty.   I had ordered a Sangria because I saw someone having it while waiting for the table. However, due to some mixups, I got one of their margarita drinks. It was all right; way too sweet for me though.  I had Queso Chicken. It was well seasoned with good grilled flavor. However, it was too salty for my taste. I think the chicken by itself would have been fine but the cheese sauce was just too much. I'd order this again but will ask the cheese sauce on the side.   I also tried a bite of the Southwest Chicken Tacos. I thought the crispy onions were a great touch. These came in flour tortillas.   I usually stay away from any restaurants with free refills of chips and salsa because I have no self control and they are my demise no matter how healthy I try to order my main dish. So although I enjoyed my meal, it will be a while before I am back for more! Lol",

I sent my meal back (and I hardly ever send food back) because I truly couldn't eat it. The Manager came over to apologize and to offer me another dish. I was starving and had been there for quite some time at this point so I just asked for a taco and rice. The rice was ok, but the taco was also too salty and couldn't be eaten. They removed the first entree from the bill and didn't charge me for the taco and rice. That was appreciated, but I wished that the food was better so I didn't have to make a meal on chips and salsa. My husband and son also agreed about the saltiness of the food, but they were starving so they ate what they could and then left the rest.   We really like the atmosphere so and we might return next Cinco de Mayo for drinks, chips & salsa, but I doubt that we will return for a meal.",

    "text": "My husband and I took our ten year old son to this  particular On the Border restaurant this last Saturday after his flag football game.   We'd never been to any On the Border before, and we love Mexican food, so we were excited to try it.   It was a disaster. There was no hostess upon entering, and there were several groups of people standing there seemingly frustrated. Finally after ten minutes a waitress appears and starts to seat us and apologizes for the wait.   The food was terrible. My husband order mini chicken tacos and it looked inedible. It was extremely greasy and the chicken looked burnt. He sent it back, but the new plate didn't look much better than the original.   My son order the mini beef tacos. His looked a bit better, but they gave him enough lettuce and cheese for maybe half of one of his tacos.   I ordered the cheese enchiladas. They looked like they'd been made two days ago and then microwaved. The rice had something in it that left a terrible after taste.   The odd thing was that this place was packed with people, and I can't figure out why anyone would go here.",

I grew up going to this on the border as a treat, I remember waiting outside for a table for an hour because it was so crowded and popular. It's changed tremendously and I wouldn't be surprised if this location closes soon.  We waited 30 min to be seated in a restaurant that was half empty on a Friday night, guess they were short staffed.. but it's Friday dinner!!  I'm allergic to dairy and ordered my dish with no cheese, showed up with cheese. I told the waiter and she brought a new plate of something that she suggested would be \"quicker\" so the rest of the group wouldn't have to wait on me. Got the bill and I was charged for the new plate that I didn't even really want.. that's just not good customer service. We didn't complain but I wouldn't have ordered it had I known.  Ordered beers, got the beers, but never brought any water. Just poor customer service overall. I get it we could've asked but still just looked bad, strike three.   Won't be going back but it was worth the visit to remember the good ole days when my family and I would eat there and have good times (10 years ago). Hope the management reads this and does something about it, would be sad to see this place go.",

    "text": "Worst experience ever. My family and I decided to come to On The Border since we hadn't been in years. Our waitress was great! The problem I have is with the food and the managers!! My parents desired to get the fajitas for two. The two meat options they picked were pork and steak. The food came out. The fajitas for two looked like fajitas for one. The pork came out BURNT and the steak (which was supposed to be cut into strips) was still together but butchered at the same time. Looked like someone chewed it and spit it back out. NASTY. I wish I would have taken pictures! We alert the waitress she apologizes and we wait for brand new food. Second time the pork was perfect but the steak tasted like it was rancid. A manager comes out and seems very \"over it\" while trying to assist my family and I. My parents decided to go for the chicken this time around. The chicken was mediocre. At the end of the now almost two hour long meal (due to all the food being disgusting the first two times) we get the check. Usually a dish that had to be sent back not once but twice gets discounted or taken off completely (I know this because I work at a restaurant.) Nothing on our bill was touched. We alert the waitress, and she thought her manager had taken it off the bill and apologized and went to get her manager again. This time a different manager by the name of Mike comes out. He asks us what is wrong. We explain everything. He keeps asking my mom questions and telling her to explain and elaborate more. I didn't think it would be that hard to comprehend that the food was awful. The whole time Mike had an extremely arrogant and belittling demeanor. So I decided to speak up and in a calm hushed voice I said flat out \"the food was shitty.\" He all of a sudden snaps. He tells my family he will take care of the meal then turns to me and says \"And next time you explain something refrain from using vulgar language.\" I was floored. I couldn't believe this man was standing there giving me the worst attitude ever because I simply said the word \"shitty.\" Before I could speak my mother is now telling him that I'm a grown woman and I can say whatever I want and will not be told by a man what I can and cannot say. I simply agree and tell him not to tell me what to say. He proceeds to say there are children around. We look and the restaurant was nearly empty and the only kid was across the restaurant. The family was in a deep discussion not even paying attention to what was going happening on our side of the restaurant. He then marches away really pissed. I was so upset and being that I have an anxiety disorder I automatically start having an anxiety attack. I leave the restaurant for some fresh air and my dad follows. I go back in a few minutes later to my mom enraged even more than before because he came back out with the new check and again stated that I shouldn't be talking like that. Are you joking?? My mom signed the check told him never to tell a woman what she can or cannot say and stormed out. We talked to corporate about the experience and they were horrified. They apologized profusely and said they do not tolerate this behavior especially from a manager. We were given a chili's gift card. We took the gift card but will never ever return.",

    "text": "If I could have given 1/2 a star, I would have - and that would have only been for the crappy waitress!  I know good Mexican/Tex-mex food - I lived in CA for most of my life where Mexican food is a daily staple; I come from a Mexican-American family as well. So, being a new resident of Charlotte NC & not knowing any of the restaurants locally, my family decided to try On The Border Restaurant because it was close to the other stores we needed to go to.     We arrived on a Friday about 4:45pm, and were seated within 5 minutes.  Waitress was devoid of any personality & Mexican food knowledge.  (That should have been a clue to get up & leave then.)  We ordered a sampler plate appetizer and some \"queso\".  Very disappointed with the lack of any flavor, except old fryer oil, in the steak nachos & taquitos & whatever else was on the plate-  the \"queso\" was just some Velveeta with canned chilies in it, microwaved until it became blubbery/rubbery!   Yuck!      Sadly, our dinner arrived shortly thereafter- another huge disappointment!  I ordered a Chile Relleno & Chicken Enchilada plate.  However, what i received was a very overly deep-fried greasy & cold brown thing - it may have been a Chile at one point - with cold hard Greasy Jack cheese inside.  I couldn't even take a bite .  The retried beans were very, very wrong, on every level!  They tasted like canned bbq beans that had been smashed & burned & then over salted!  The rice was disgusting - it tasted like oil/grease & old rice.  The chicken enchilada was equally disgusting & lacked any flavor other than old fryer oil.      My kids ordered quesadillas- they took one bite & said it was gross ( they wanted to go home & have me make the a real quesadilla!).   My husband was able to eat some of his meal, but had horrible indigestion later that evening.   I think the local Taco Bell has better \"Mexican\" food than this On The Border!   They should just probably change the name to \"On The Toilet\"! Never returning & sooo not recommending this place to anyone! Severely Disappointed !!! No bueno!! No Mas!!",

    "text": "I had been to this restaurant years ago (in NY) but since it was christmas eve our choices were limited so we figured we would try it out. Overall it was ok, our service was great and food was fine, all except the mushroom and spinach enchilada. It was filed with corn with 2 mushrooms and maybe 3 pieces of spinach that were miniscule. It was very disappointing. The beef tacos that i ordered with the combo were fine. My advice is just to be prepared to maybe be a bit let down on what you order.  The salsa was a tad bland as well. Nothing horrible overall but food wise nothing really stood out, the service though was enjoyable.",

They text and talk to each other while people wait in line to get a table. Tried to get in with a table of seven the other night. Place was more than half empty on a Friday night at 8 PM. We were told it would be an hour wait. We were the only ones in the lobby and way more than half the tables were empty. We were told that business had been very slow so they laid off their wait staff and the problem was no waiters to serve the tables. We were told we were welcome to stand in the lobby for an hour and wait to sit. We told them we were in no hurry and that we would be happy to sit at a table and wait for service. We were told that was \"against their policy\". Really. Walked out and had a great dinner at a little Italian restaurant in the same shopping center. Spent well over $200 for a nice casual dinner. Decided to go back and let the manager know what happened so he could better train his hostess and wait staff. The place was dead empty by 9 PM. Manager confirmed it was his policy not to seat anyone even if table were open. Bad idea. These people hate their job and don't want customers as it takes away from their socializing time with each other. Plus, they were making fun of other waiters and some of their customers and we could overhear them. This place really just needs to go out of business at this point and let someone open up a great restaurant in this prime location. Everyone from the manager to the employees have no clue about customer service. We have been here many times as have our friends and it had been a decent experience. Last time we went was a couple of months ago and the food was marginal and the service was slow but we thought it might have just been a bad night and decided to give them another chance. Big mistake on our part. They have deteriorated to a place beyond repair. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague.",

    "text": "I usually don't frequent places like this, especially for the food-it is just too Americanized.  However I had a pretty banging time, it helps when the bartenders and patrons are all full of laughter and very strong margaritas.  Seriously, I would never attempt to have more than one of these things.    There were people of all ages-college to older folks.  I went with a good group of comical friends who kept me entertained, but I couldn't help from overhear this airhead woman jabbering about the most random subject matter from the seven dwarfs to her political views.  It didn't annoy me though, it just made me laugh.  Oh trophy wives are great.    The bartender was a younger guy who kept the drinks flowing with precision and timeliness.  I might be back if I am around these parts again.",

    "text": "This place is okay. Most of the food is very heavy, even the salads. If it's not salad it's very very cheesy, greasy, or loads of meat. I almost always order something from their little health section, where the sides are healthy vegetables and the portion is smaller.  I get tired of this place because of the grease though.  There's nothing to complain about with the service or the facility itself. Very easy to find. It stands out while you drive by on Providence Road because of the brightly lit letters of the restaurant.",

    "text": "Tex-Mex chain restaurants are as inspired as the American hamburger these days, but On The Border really sticks out for quality service, food, and portions.  I can't say that I was overly wowed by it, but I was quite pleased with what I got.    On all occasions I visited, I have had friendly, personable staff who seemed to enjoy what they were doing and joked around with our party.  Their taquitos are great; crispy fried goodness with chicken, onions, and covered in sauce.I agree with Kathy that the food is greasy, but what can you expect from a chain like this?   Rather than the obligatory refried beans and dried-out, bland rice of most places, they use black beans and well-seasoned rice.   The chips and salsa were surprisingly fresh and not overly salted like other Tex-Mex chains.  For a chain, they have surprisingly fresh food.  Service is quick and On the Border is rarely crowded like neighboring restaurants.  I recommend it for a hearty lunch with co-workers or friends. It's nothing that will leave a lasting legacy, but On the Border probably won't let you down either.",

He thought  this would be fun to see them made at the table. All the server did was dump the cheese, etc. in the  bowl and stir! Not much of a show for 8.00! Bad nachos. However the chips and salsa at the table were good.",

The fish is grilled and tender and the chipotle sauce has just enough kick. I finished my meal with the Apple Crisp dessert which was also terrific. I have been and will always be a huge fan of On the Border and my recent visit definitely confirmed that.",

    "text": "I have to say I've always loved me some On The Border. I'm definitely not a picky person when it comes to Mexican. This Tex-Mex chain is one of the best though. I used to live near the one in Concord, NC and seemed to eat there at least twice a month. Now that I'm on the other side of town, this location isn't that close to me, so I don't make it out to On The Border as much as I would like. The free chips and salsa that they first bring out are the best. I always find this to be a test with any Mexican restaurant. If the Chips and Salsa suck.... then things usually go down from there...lol. I have always seemed to enjoy everything I have ever ordered on the menu, but on this visit I got the Southwest Chicken Tacos with a bed of rice (no beans). I had already told my friends at the table about it, and it just so happened that the Waitress recommended it also. And any good meal at a Mexican restaurant can't be complete unless you have a Margarita, and On The Border has one of my favorites. Its a Swirl Margarita with Sangria mixed in it!!! And you have to make sure you ask for the Sangria one, as there are different selections. I highly recommend this Margarita. If anything go to On The Border just for it...... you won't be disappointed!!!",
