It's a quick order, and they bring the food out to you.  The muffalettas are HUUUUGE.  The sandwiches are awesome and so are the actual salads (never tried the salad bar option yet).  I've gotten the nutty salad, and the salmon caesar.  All top notch.  This is definitely a quick get in and out and good food to boot whether it's lunch or dinner.",

My favorite part is getting the half sandwich (any on the menu) and half salad (which is large enough to put your head in).  There are complimentary muffins on the dessert bar and free ice cream too.  Everything is fresh and/or organic.  I'll go any chance I'm over this way.",

The best part about Jason's Deli is the flaw in service. None of the staff notice all the freeloading. Now I have never freeloaded, from here. But everyone just goes up and dips from the salad bar, taking all the cake they could possibly desire. Why would you pay for a fountain drink when the cups are right next to the machine? My little brother especially loves Jason's Deli because of all the candy laying out and specialty soft drinks in glass bottles. I can't tell you how many times we have had to empty his pockets and send him back or make him pay for the drink he has casually walked off with.  Despite all the looting happening right before your eyes Jason's Deli is basic restaurant where you can't go wrong.",

    "text": "Grub wise, Jason's deli is pretty affordable and the food is decent. No complaints there. The to-go process makes me want to bang my head against a wall tho. About once a month everyone at work decides \"lets have Jason's  for lunch\". I am the person who gets to make this happen.  First time i saw they offered delivery \"Sweet, right?\" Um no, Its like $8 extra for delivery. Which they don't tell you over the phone. Not cool. On this occasion the money collection at work wasn't adding up so i had to call for itemized sammich prices and only then was i told about the delivery charge. They did wave it since they had neglected to mention it but $8 to deliver 1 mile, no thank you, not doing that again. So now i call everything in and pick it up myself...not once out of roughly 20 orders has everything actually been correct. Dressings for salads have been left out, menu items missing and sometimes haven't even made it on to the ticket...requests for extra pickles ignored. It's an uphill battle with this place. So, its not to be obnoxious but i have to take everything out before i leave and verify all the food is there. Ive been conditioned. My advice is anyone picking up a to-go order is to do the same. Like i said, the food is actually pretty good but honestly i don't think grabbing a few sandwiches and salads need to be so difficult.",

Your choice - before or after you eat, no matter. Most people were eating while they waiting for their food to be delivered. I was in awe...ha. The roast beef sandwich was great and the portion was large...couldn't finish it all.

I'm always blown away by the selection of fresh meats, cheeses, and bread and the combinations that the cheerful staff point clueless folks to.  .  VEGETARIANS BEWARE: YOU WILL BE APPALLED BY WHAT I WILL SAY NEXT.  Like Todd W. says, the roast beef sandwich is awesome.  I've had it twice and I can honestly say its the best roast beef sammie I can recall.  It's not like that grey matter they serve at Arby's.  No, its pink at the core, moist and pilled 1-inch thick on bread.  The sides are equally appealing, like the homemade-tasting potato salad.The portions alone make this place stand out-think McAllister's on steroids  The salad bar looked incredibly fresh as well.  In fact, the whole establishment looks fresh.  Yes, you get free muffins and ice cream.  But don't let them spoil your appetite-their sandwiches alone will bust your gut.  For around $8, you will leave Jason's Deli fat and happy.",

Knowing how delicious their food is, I gave them a call and the manager Tim said they had closed at 10 but since I was close he told me he'd reopen for me. Not only did he not rush me, he made recommendations and even threw in a couple extras. It was a great way to start my trip so if you're in Pineville, NC, go to Jason's Deli and ask for Tim.

I do love the instant salad bar line where you can jump the big line and order a salad (plus soup and proteins) on a card-only kiosk. I NEVER wait which is one of the reasons I go to Jason's. The other main reason I go to Jason's is the salad bar. It's always fresh and has some nice extras. The only negatives are that frequently the lettuce is wetter than I like and they put ice down in some of the vegetables which ends up in my salad. Also I miss the cauliflower! Minor details.

I thought I'd give this place a try.  $10.00 got me a 6\" meatball sub on a white bun, Lay's potato chips, and a pickle spear, with a regular soda.  The sub was not one bit better than Subway.  This was a complete waste of my time and money.  I could have had the same exact thing (sans the pickle), and chosen my own chips from a variety.   They have a lot of food on the menu; I have no idea how the soups, salads, etc. are.  All I know is that I couldn't even find a list of the types of bread they offer on the menu.  This place is hard to navigate, and the food quality is not worth the trouble.  UPDATE:  Went back for lunch (at a friend's request) on Tuesday (11/1).  I had the chicken club salad and a cup of the Southwestern Chicken Chili.  Both were quite good.  My bill:  $14.90.  I'll up the rating to 2 stars, as the food is OK (not great), but it is WAY overpriced.",

Instead of holding up the line to ask why, I decided to bite the bullet. The man delivering our food wasn't paying attention and couldn't find our order number on our table so I had to try to flag him down but I lost him and my food was cold by the time it reached the table (he walked past us 3 times) ...

I try to eat healthy-ish 80-90% of the time, so I was perusing the menu looking for a tasty wrap or sandwich. The Ranchero wrap stood out in all its spicy glory: Organic wheat wrap with natural, grilled chicken breast, cheddar, jalapenos, pico de gallo, Southwest spices, ranch dressing. Served with organic blue corn tortilla chips and salsa for $6.99.   Was this wrap tasty? Yes. Should I have, perhaps, asked for the ranch on the side? Yes...because thanks to Jason's very well put together website and easily accessible nutrition information, this wrap bombed me with 680 calories, 28 grams of fat and more than 2,000 grams of sodium. Damn Gina.   Now, I'm not blaming this establishment for serving highly caloric items...it happens. I like Jason's. I just have to be a bit more careful of what I order!",

They have made a few improvements. They have a lot of the menu items listed behind the counter but it is not all inclusive. There are also kiosks where you can order yourself  The best kept secret about this place is that to-go salads. Order at the counter and they will give you a large, clear, recyclable plastic container for salad plus two containers for dressing and dessert. You can make a pretty good salad to take with you. The only proteins are hard-boiled eggs which seem to be made off premises and salad topping bacon (not bacon bits though).   There were fewer kids the two times I visited recently because I went for lunch and dinner during the week. Sanitation grade was borderline low at 90 but acceptable.  I will continue to go back just for the salad bar.",

I was able to order right away and decided to attempt to get a \"healthy\" lunch so I ordered the Ranchero Chicken Wrap to go...it comes with in an organic wheat wrap and blue chips and salsa...so in my book that's healthy enough for me!   BUT...what made the trip so awesome was that while I was waiting for them to prepare my wrap the manager came out from behind the counter and said it wouldn't be a long  but to help myself to an ice cream cone while I waited....can you say WINNING!!!   But now on to the wrap...  When I first unwrapped it, I wasn't very impressed with how it looked but once I tasted it all those thoughts were pushed aside. The wrap comes in a wheat wrap with grilled chicken breast, cheddar cheese ,jalapenos, pico de gallo, some southwest spices and ranch dressing. The  jalapenos added a nice little kick, but they weren't overpowering. I couldn't really taste the southwest spices perhaps they were overpowered by the ranch dressing but unlike most people I'm a fan of ranch dressing ( I know it's a lot of calories but its so delicious I digress)   The blue chips were good but the salsa was delicious! It tasted VERY fresh. It was so good, I added some of the my wrap....YUMMY!  Overall, I was very impressed....enjoyed my lunch and the ice cream cone....will I be back....of course!",

    "text": "*** I think this location does a fine job if you eat your food there or take it to go. ***   However: if you use this location for business catering - it's a whole different story.  They usually miss at least one thing from the order and they tend to arrive late.  I'm not sure how this is actually providing \"catering\" service since getting the order * correct and on time * are the two main points to hit when you're making your money from business catering sales.    I'm never one to want \"money off\" or \"a freebie\".  We're willing to pay for the services we use, but we do actually expect to get the service you're selling after we pay full price for it.    So when the manager offered to comp our hour late delivery yesterday, I told him I didn't want the money back, I wanted him to tell me how I can feel confident to use them again for my office catering because in all honesty, I need to be able to use this Jason's Deli because of their wide variety and healthy options.  It's truly not about the money for me- it's about having faith that they can actually handle the business that they advertise for and that I want to give them.  When I said these words to the general manager, Josh, he just blinked at me and actually said \"I'm not sure what you mean by that...\"  I could tell by his facial expression that my words weren't at all sinking in and that he simply didn't care to the level that I did, so I accepted his offer to refund the order and asked for something in writing that showed the order had in fact been comped.    It's a sad state when I have money to spend, I chose a place of business based on their own advertisements of what they can accomplish and I'm still left unsatisfied at the end.  Fail.",

I recommend the Zucchini Grillini sandwich, which is as fun to eat as it is to say.  It is layers of zucchini with tomatoes, red onions, black olives and Russian dressing which is the perfect blend of complements on this sandwich.  Enjoy it with the blue corn tortilla chips or a side of fresh fruit.  Don't forget the ice cream machine for your free ice cream afterward.

    "text": "The last few visits I've just felt like something is off at the location. The managers I used to see walking around are no longer present and things have gone downhill. The salad bar is usually dirty, drippy and under stocked. Food not being delivered to the table in a timely manner. The tables go forever without being cleaned. It's just not the JAson's Deli we expect.   Today I ordered soup and salad - per usual. I'm not sure why you have to get a number for a cup of soup, but whatever. I retrieved my salad bowl, found table, put my number in the holder and filled my plate. Quite a while went by and no soup. I was sitting in a booth directly across from the food prep area, my number clearly in sight. Then I notice a cup of soup (the kind of ordered) just sitting there all lonely and growing cold on the prep line. Every so often a worker (including the manager) would sort of stare at it or nudge it out of their way a bit, but clearly no one felt motivated to actually ask why it was sitting there. They were back there cutting up and having a good time. No worries. Multiple people glanced at my table and could see I still had a number in my holder. At that point, I was almost finished with my salad and figured this little waiting game should end. I walked to the counter and handed them my number and inquired about my soup. They had no clue and asked what kind I ordered. Despite the soup RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF THEM, two people went hunting to figure out where my soup was. Just then a woman walked out of the back (maybe a manager), so they asked her and she pointed to the cup asking if it could be what they were looking for. Wow!  That didn't need to take 25 mins from order to handing it to me. I declined the soup at that point because I'm sure it was cold and everyone had been standing there working around it for so long. Just really poor customer service.   I'll be checking this place off the list.",

Even the manager has once come out to offer water and offer us to go get a couple carrots from the salad bar for him.  It is that kind of hospitality that we love to see as a dog owner. So thank you :)  Aside from that, if you have not been to a Jason's Deli, they offer a lot.  Jason's deli's have been consistent with their food from each location we have been to.  My favorites - chili (both regular and southwestern chicken), salad bar, and some of their sandwiches - particularly the papa joe (turkey sandwich with pesto).  Of course, at the end of each meal you can go and get some ice cream.  I usually don't partake since it isn't the best, but it does offer something for the sweet tooth.",

Myself and some friends stopped for dinner tonight, I had just had surgery an had no food for over 24 hours. My one friend is Vegan so the salad bar is perfect , I wanted the chicken salad sandwich an salad bar. My other friend received her food an I kept waiting on mine. Finished my salad it was about 20 mins later. I walked up to the counter an asked if they forgot to make my sandwich? I showed the guy my receipt an he said we couldn't find your table, you have to put the number up . I said it's on the table , he said it has to be up on the stand. I wanted to say why are you arguing with me ! I said it's on the stand , he took my receipt an said he would make it. I went an got ice cream came back over an asked could he box it to go my friends were done. Plus I was ready to go home an take pain meds an go to bed.  Here is my problem last time I was there I ordered the same thing I got half a sandwich instead of the whole SMH I showed it to the guy he said you got the salad bar an half sandwich is what the cashier put in. I said I told her a whole one can you make me the rest I will pay for it.  The guy told me no he would just make it I didn't have to pay. I don't know what's going on with Jason's deli but I won't be treated like that an I had just had surgery an starving. Next time I should go to McAllister's I don't have any issues there",

Worst was the size of the pastrami serving. It was so small, that the $8 sandwich was mostly bread. Lastly, the meat was so tough that I had to make an effort to eat it.  Cutting costs is not the way to get repeat business. Jason's Deli used to make really good sandwiches. Not sure what happened. Won't be ordering food from them again.",

The only problem with this location, as with most other Jason's deli locations, is that it gets incredibly busy. When I come here for lunch on the weekends, I try to get here no later than 11:30 to avoid the rush.  There are a slew of sandwiches available in addition to the salad bar, as well as soup and a variety of sides. The best part, the free ice cream for dessert!  I always use the kiosk to order the salad bar, skipping the line which is really convenient. All of the staff members here are great, but Richard is especially friendly and helpful and goes out of his way to make sure that everyone has what they need.",

Like how I remembered, the place was packed and was bustling with laughs, conversations, and of course food. Jason's Deli is not a sit down restaurant meaning that you have to place your order at the cash register then sit down wherever you can find space. I ordered the Manager's Special which is half a sandwich, chips, and a cup of soup. I opted for the broccoli cheese which in my family is famous. For my sandwich, I ordered turkey breast, American cheese, and mustard on toasted wheat bread (Yes, very plain but I like it). When I got my order, my sandwich had jalapenos and mayonnaise on it. I took it back and when the staff member gave it back to me for the second time it had no mustard and wasn't toasted! I didn't want to make them angry so I just asked for mustard on the side. Don't get me wrong, it all tasted great, but the service just wasn't the best.",

I walked in to this location today and the sanitation grade was 88!! WHAT??? You can't be serious. I turned and walked out. Please improve the sanitation grade! I would really like to come back here. But as long as the sanitation grade is that low, I will NOT return. Management should definitely NOT be satisfied with leaving a score like that hanging on their wall. IF you have remedied the issues that caused the score to be this low, please call the health department back to come out and recheck your restaurant! I was really craving a Beefeater!  **UPDATE**  Been back a couple of times since my first review. SOOO glad to report their sanitation score has GREATLY improved!! Restaurant seems cleaner, better run and had good service. YEAH!! Life is sweeter, again, with that Beefeater, broccoli cheese soup, and free chocolate ice cream. It's the little things, ya know? Keep up the good work here and I'll be HAPPY to spend my $$ with y'all!!    SORRY THIS REVIEW LOOKS SO WONKY. NOT SURE HOW I DID THIS! IGNORE THE 2nd (REPEATED) REVIEW!  Quik Tip: Just tried the new steak sandwich. Not worth it. Sorry. But they are testing out an expanded kids menu!! Lots of choices and more vegetarian friendly for our little ones!! Go check it out. It looks great!",
