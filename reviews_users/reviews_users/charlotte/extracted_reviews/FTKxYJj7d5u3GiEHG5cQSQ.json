    "text": "BWW's is a place I always want to go. When the food is fresh and accurate you can forgive the place's natural shortfalls. The problem is that this location is possibly the worst run BWW's I've ever been to.  Not once, not twice, but THREE times I've been burned by terrible service and disgustingly cold food. I've come back because other franchises have proved that the formula is workable. I had one good lunch experience a couple months ago, but as far as I'm concerned this place is dead to me. There are multiple places within 3 blocks that can do wings but cheaper and without sullen, lazy servers.  Not only that, but there's a guy with a pic of their wings who's left not one but two 5-star reviews and nothing else? Give me a break. Get it together, Yelp.",

Once the main coarse order was taken, we were told they were out of salads, but no menu was brought to make another selection.  The person who ordered the salad, but had to change the selection got food 10-15 minutes before everyone else.  The waiter was not engaged in our table until the very end when an explanation was being made as to what happened and why the promised discount wasn't applied the first time; moving on to the next task/table before finishing with us; almost annoyed by questions.  Water cups were also mixed up, if you're going to take cups please make sure you bring them back to the correct person! Serve was not great by the wait staff or the kitchen or the manager.  Sad because I'm sure they could have more business and better tips.",

After waiting 13 minutes, our waitress Morgan showed up with an attitude. Our drink order consisted of 2 glasses of water, one with a lemon, well that took another 12 minutes without the lemon, not sure how long it takes to get 2 glasses of water. I had the opportunity to speak to the manager & express my disappointment, he apologized & stated how hard it is to find good help.  Keep your expectations really low when visiting this BWW.",

Was seated immediately and allowed to stay at the same table for nearly 3 hours despite the restaurant getting busier and busier.  Of course I was continuously ordering food and drinks and not just getting free Coke refills.  Server was very friendly and accommodating.  Fried pickles were quite good, Chili con queso was just generic cheese sauce with pre-made chili tossed in, nothing very special at all and a little disappointing to say the least.  I ordered the boneless wings, mango habenero, as my entree.  While the sauce was quite spicy and tasty, the 'wings' (read: chicken nuggets) had a little too much breading on them and tasted as if they had spent a minute too long in the fryer.  They were tough in spots and a little dry.  Good place to hang out and drink a few beers, but the food is just so-so.",

    "text": "Franchises tend to be a little tough to judge since it's difficult to hold each one at the same standard. However, my experience at Buffalo Wild Wings (B'dubs) here in Charlotte never leaves me unsatisfied.  To begin with, the real estate is huge and located right next to the NASCAR museum. They've got a whole block and a half of restaurant space that includes indoor / outdoor seating and a large central bar. I'd say there are at least 30 TVs (various sizes, 45 in+) surrounding you as you eat. Often you'll see the evening's game on the big screen (in which case the restaurant is packed), or UFC Championship Fights, or sports discussions with celebrities that you can't actually hear :P The general vibe of the place is upbeat and the staff is usually quite friendly.  When it comes down to the menu, I have to comment on the variety that's available at your fingertips. Not feeling wings today? They've got burgers. You don't eat beef? Chicken wraps and popcorn shrimp! Vegetarian? Fried pickles! Seriously, it would probably take you awhile to try everything on the menu, but each item appears to revolve around the B'dub special sauces. I will review each one for you here:  Sweet BBQTM - Nice Sweet BBQ Southern Flavor, easy on the tongue TeriyakiTM - Not the best, also sweet, slightly tangy, not very Asian MildTM - Classic Buffalo Parmesan GarlicTM - It's like eating a Ceasar Dressing Wing MediumTM - Classic Buffalo Honey BBQTM - One of my favorites, nice honey and smoky flavor Spicy GarlicTM - Another great one, getting spicier, pasty texture, garlicky Jammin' JalapenoTM - This one is good, limited time only, not much jalepeno taste, more lime and sweetness Asian Zing - Like Sweet Asian Pepper Sauce for your Crab Rangoons Caribbean JerkTM - Very Peppery, not that spicy, ...has a jerk flavor? Thai CurryTM - Salty as hell, very much a thai curry flavor, it's slightly confusing Hot BBQTM - Quite hot, spice almost masks the bbq flavor HotTM - Classic Buffalo Mango HabaneroTM - All time favorite, except it can be difficult to handle the spice for prolonged periods of time. This one will blow your head off. It's deceptively sweet until the heat kicks in with a 2 second delay. Not much mango, but  still tons of fruity flavor. Wild - Getting to the point where it's unbearably hot Blazin' - You'll get the runs.  If you're not into the sauces, they have dry rubs too, which are.... dry. Stick to the classics ;)  And If you don't like bones, you can go ahead and have the tenders. Occasionally, they'll do something like half off wings or all you can eat wings on the weekday lunch hour, which is good if you can pack away an insane amount of wings in a 2-3 hr span. I've had the limited edition Captain Morgan flavor, which is another favorite, I highly recommend. Nice rum flavor.  All in all, good for groups, sports, food, and drinks. When it's packed though, your order can take a long time. Be warned!  4/5",

We then ordered food.   I ordered 12 boneless wings and was brought regular wings.  My salad was delivered without silverware so I had to snag some from another table.  My wife's fish tacos were supposed to come with tortilla chips and salsa, they came with fries instead.  I will say the manager corrected everything, but it sucked since we were on our way to a show and almost late because of how disorganized this place was.  It will be a while before I go back.  The wings suck anyway and most of the food is frozen then fried crap.",

Yep BW3's has a moscow mule but it\"s served in a glass mug and not the traditional copper mug. It's not that great, the bartender put way toi much vodka in it and smidge of ginger beer and yhe ginger beer is what really makes the drink.

Found the host stand which was empty. After a few minutes, we were greeted and led to a table. The floor was incredibly sticky. Were were sat at a table which was not very clean, and I even needed to wipe the crumbs off the seat before sitting. The menus were very sticky as well. We waited quite some time with no service. A server walked past us over to the table behind us but didn't even acknowledge us. She was mumbling something which sounded like complaining, then walked away. All we saw were employees hanging around talking to each other but yet no one came to greet us. We finally got up and walked out. Honestly, if the dining room was that dirty/sticky, I don't even want to know what the kitchen was like. We had our lunch at Hooters instead and I enjoyed everything about them. Better service for sure, clean, and great food! Avoid this location if possible, go somewhere where the managers and employees actually care.",

When the waitress came over I asked what was so funny and she said because we knew y'all was looking for the restroom. We ordered our food and the food wasn't right plus the food was horrible!!! Nachos were dry and didn't have anything on them but they were supposedly to ultimate nachos. (NOT) none of us enjoyed our food. This location is uptown and it was EMPTY now I know why!! This place is horrible. We won't be going back!",

    "text": "Astonishingly Mediocre   Alas, this experience was everything I dislike about corporate restaurants--unenthusiastic employees following a script, slow and incompetent service, uninspiring food.  While I understand that a party of 9 is a large group, the restaurant wasn't busy during our time there at lunch, and there seemed to be no cross service to help out our waitperson.  Despite being perhaps 30% full, our lunches took about 25 minutes to deliver.  And the order was incomplete, one entree was incorrect, one not delivered at all.  Too bad it was wings, as it took another 20 minutes for them to arrive--and these too were incorrect.  I guess other than being part of the name, wings are a difficult entree to prepare.  The waitperson apologized, then started complaining about the kitchen staff--True professionalism.  The head host (who introduced herself as we sat and left a flyer with us) never came by to apologize.  Despite us being obviously ready to go after over an hour there, the waitperson had to go back and finalize the bill, which was incorrect.  We were charged for the delayed (and incorrect wings), but were not charged for the incorrect salad entree.  That would somewhat make sense, but it was not mentioned by the waitperson, so I don't know if it was a mistake or intentionally complimentary.  My entree was entirely forgettable (indeed, a few days later I have no recollection of what it was).  I do recall that the onion rings were soggy and greasy.  The two word review:  Why Bother?",

    "text": "First time I went there I was not happy. I decided to giver it another try last night - MISTAKE!  Got seated promptly and was informed my server would be there shortly (can't remember the name we were given). About 5-6 minutes later a different waitress shows up and asks if we had been helped. Since we had not she said she would take care of us. She then impressed us (party of 5) by remembering all our order even with the couple of special requests.   She brought our drinks, minus one sweet tea - said it was brewing and would be out shortly, which it was.  45 minutes later... I track down a \"Captain\" and explain we are hungry, cold, and tired of waiting. He stops playing with his phone and talking to the security guard long enough to tell he me he'll check on it.  2 minutes later - runner is parading a tray full of what looks to be our food around the restaurant. Sure enough, it was indeed our food which is now ICE COLD. It felt like it had been sitting under an A/C vent (did I mention how cold it was in this location). Oh heck no - I had it. I told him this was unacceptable and demanded to see the manager. Our waitress came back and asked what was wrong - we handed her some of the food and she confirmed - ICE COLD. She left to get the manager. Manager comes out - asks what's wrong. OMG! I made him stick his finger in my plate to see how cold it was. He apologized, said he would replace it and of course not make us pay for it.  So I guess to ensure it is hot, every order (party of 5, remember) comes out individually as it is finished. First my wife's, then her sisters, then her husband's and then mine - I mean come on, its not rocket surgery here. Oh, and we never got silverware and napkins - not even with the initial order. I asked for them TWICE, and only got them after my wife's second plate was delivered.  This place was stocked with servers - must have been 12 of them. I guess they had no kitchen this night, but it doesn't matter to me because I WILL NEVER GO BACK!",

Mixed drinks are available, but anything that requires carbonation pass on it.  We tried the club soda, the tonic and the Pepsi and they were all room temperature and flat.  What a way to ruin a drink.    The food...even for bar food it wasn't great.  How bad can you mess up a chicken quesadilla?  Not put much chicken or cheese in it for starters...It looks huge because of the tortilla used, but the chicken and cheese in all 4 slices would barely be enough to fill up one slice.    Again, great concept with all the tv's, but obviously coasting by on hotel traffic and unconcerned with repeat business.",

Having two patties on the burger with the steak... It Was just my eyes being bigger than my stomach. Was not a good idea. Steak was aight. Not the best but decent.   So me and my gluttonous self ordered some hot wings and blue cheese. I looooooove hot wings and blue cheese. (Their ranch sux too). I just wanted one wing... Just one rib... I mean wing. I ate that one wing that night... And polished off the rest the next day. Gud!  Note to self: order wings at a place with \"wings\" in the name.",

Simple stuff like napkins (with our wings), sauces, knew absolutely nothing about anything we asked about.  Literally couldn't answer any questions.  Kept going inside, coming out with the answers to our questions, then later finding out what he told us price wise was wrong after we had ordered, and he told us the staff lied to him .  We ordered shots of fireball and they were out. So he offered jack \"red\" which is practically the same thing.  We got the shots, took them, and they were straight Jack Daniels, which I despise. Yuck.  We told him and he was like, oh sorry about that.  The bill came, they didn't charge us correctly.   Charges me 9$ for a weak mimosa when the game day menu clearly states $5.00. This went on an on for everyone's bill.  So annoying.  The manager came out and I explained I was not happy about paying for a shot that I didn't order.  I mean, with a shot, you take it and then you realize it's not right.  If it were a drink, I would have sent it back, but didn't have that choice. We all ordered shots that were wrong (6 of us) He said, \"yeah, sorry about that.\"  Didn't discount anything. Ughh.  I told him to fix it or I would write a bad yelp review, and nothing.  So here I am.  Writing a bad yelp review.  I hope the manager sees it and corrects these mistakes.  I'll never go back and wouldn't recommend anyone to go there.  People make mistakes, the way a manager handles it, is what sets them apart.",

At 7:30 I received a call (thinking it was my delivery) only to be told they would not be delivering any food tonight.   They literally waited until the last minute to inform me that my Super Bowl party would not be receiving any food that night.

They brought my foot, they brought my beers, but there was no personal interaction, no, um, service.  I had to call out to engage the bartender, and I was close enough to overhear the two bartenders complaining about another group of customers on the other side of the bar.  Pretty unpleasant as a new patron.    Don't expect good service, and the food and drink will exceed expectation.",

Sauces don't really cover all the wings--can clearly tell the wings are microwaved, and the sauces are drizzled on afterwards.  You can find better wings in the aisle of a local Harris Teeter.  I guess I should've gone with Wild Wing Cafe.  Service was just as bad.  We got seated in an area and had to wait a literal 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge us.  At that point, I had to personally ask to get us a server.  Otherwise, I'm pretty sure we would have sat there all evening.  She didn't mess up any orders, but didn't know what to do.  We order drinks, she tries to put the order in, but realizes she needs our IDs.  We don't get any napkins/utensils until requested.  Just stuff like that.  Oh yeah, bring your own carrots and celery--despite what the menu says, the wings do not come with it.  These pictures on Yelp! are deceiving.  (AGAIN, DO NOT COME HERE).  dmo out",

The service was so bad that I wrote a note on the receipt how awful the service was and this was the first time in my life I was not leaving a tip. Normally I tip 20% + because I have waited tables and know what's it's all about. The unbelievable thing was when I received my credit card statement I say that the waitress added a $4 tip to my receipt! When I called to speak to a manager there was no sincere apologies bit I was  told that my $4 would be credited to my card. This was theft and fraud and I warn everyone to check your receipt if you still choose to dine here. Fyi- emailed my experience to the corporate office and received no response from them.

BWW used to validate parking, which made it about $2.00 / hour.  Today, I was informed that they no longer validate, and I paid $7.00 to spend 2 hours at BWW.

I feel that my bad experience at a location does not necessarily mean that the restaurant should suffer for it, because your experience might be better than mine.  However, I am so put off by this place and multiple bad experiences that I truly feel the need to warn EVERYONE from going there.  There are LOTS of other choices in Charlotte, no need to support this business that treats customers so poorly.  We had a reservation to start my Bachelor Party here, due to the convenient location of being next to our hotel (not due to positive experiences in the past, that's for sure).  The reservation was made weeks in advance & would have been between 10  - 14 adult males all drinking alcohol and devouring wings and appetizers, etc for a few hours before moving the party to a more adult-oriented location..   The tables were not ready on time.  Not really a problem, that's ok.  We can work with that.  The hostess showed us a small table (8 top) that was ready immediately, as well as the table(s) where we would prefer to be located, but we needed to wait 10 minutes.  We chose to wait for the larger table.  We stood at the front for over 30 minutes.  Those of us made to stand at the front and wait included my fiance's 75 year old father and my 65 year old father!  The hostess offered (again) to put us at the smaller table (8 top), or we could wait for the big table.. Again we chose to wait for the larger table, as we knew that the 8-top was too small.   They told us our table was ready after 35 minutes of waiting, and the manager was there helping to set the table.  The problem was:  the table was the smaller table that we were offered over 30 minutes prior.  When I questioned the manager about it, and pointed to the tables behind us where we had been promised, he said that larger set was going to a party of 20 that was a WALK-IN behind us (a group of teenage volley ball players).   I explained what we just went through, all the waiting, and the communication with the hostess, that we had a reservation for weeks - and they were not ready for us, and we had been waiting over 30 minutes for that particular table, and now he was suggesting he was going to give it to the party of 20 teenagers who cannot even order a drink from the bar?  He said, \"no I am not planning on giving it to them, I AM giving it to them\".  We left, as I would not let any of my friends or family spend single dime in a location that would talk to us that way; and we spent over 3000 dollars in food and alcohol at the Wild Wing Cafe around the corner (located in the Epicenter).  I sure hope those teenagers were able to order a LOT of wings to make up for the loss of income to the bartenders!!   Do yourself a favor.  Do not eat here & support businesses with poor customer service in today's economy!  There are plenty more deserving businesses in Charlotte that deserve the patronage, because they care!",

Finally, I voiced in and asked if I can just sit at the bar since I came in solo. I went to the bar and waited about ten minutes just to get greeted and to get a menu. The bartender came off a bit loud and somewhat had a rude tone. I have worked in at restaurants, so for me, I always have a habit of watching how others in the business value their customers since they are working based mostly off tips. The bartender was paying attention to a select couple only and it took another then minutes just to order my lunch. The bartender was eating at the back of the bar and to me it was disgusting to be serving drinks and eating their own food in site. After, I got my lunch, another couple came to the bar and were waiting to get greeted as well... it's wasn't just me which made me feel somewhat better.... it lacks customer service and it's sad to come to a place right next to NASCAR Hall of Fame and end with a bad experience when there's so many other food options in uptown I will consider next time.",

I expected the long wait to be seated as we were a party of 12 and there was a big event at the convention center. We went to be seated and a party walked in off the street and was sitting at the table luckily the table next to them was open so we were seated after we had to find enough chairs. We were finally waited on after 30 minutes. I never received my food so after 3 hours in a restaurant I never got to eat. It was ridiculous.",

Food was also poor quality, boneless wings were undercooked and chewy.",

    "text": "This was supposed to be a fun time meeting old friends and catching up while grabbing a good meal. We started by waiting in a busy waiting area. We knew it might be a little wait which we did not mind; however, we were a group of 5 and were told it would be a 45 minute wait. Since there was a volleyball tournament and an Avon event all going on, we knew it might be a little while. I did walk around the restaurant a little during our long waiting period. The biggest issue I witnessed was the lack of urgency to get empty dirty tables cleaned. It should not take 10 minutes to clean these tables. So after 1.5 hours passed we were finally seated. We thought we could order quickly and still get something time to chat. A person came over that told us she was not our waitress, but would take our drink order. After about 15 minutes, our drinks finally showed up. So a different waitress came over to take our food order. After another 30 minutes we were wanting to order more drinks but no one would stop buy our table. Finally our food was delivered by a guy we had not seen before. We asked him if he could have our waitress stop by so we could order more drinks. He proceeded to tell us he was out waiter, so obviously we ordered drinks with him. As for the food... it was average bar food. the wings were a little over cooked and the fried pickles were ok. Not a fan of this location we may never come back to this location. Poor service all around.",

Rest had to be sent back and arrived much later and cold. 1 order never arrived until I had to stand by the kitchen door to find our server. Servers were rude. I fell on the greasy floor on my way to the restroom.  The staff literally just looked away. I had to the chase manager around the floor to tell him about the greasy floor. Again he just nodded me off. The second time he said he'll get a mop. Was there for 2 hrs and NOT one refill. I had to get up and go get refills from soda stand myself. Got 15% off. Did I mention the not helpful server?  Was missing most of the 2 hours. We were ALL shocked with our experience and I was so embarrassed that I recommended this for a nice lunch!! This puts a stain on our lovely Queen City! Please don't contact me. Nothing will make this okay. Owners need to be more engaged/ aware!",

I've never had to wait for a table at this location, even on wing nights. My service has always been exceptional. My only real complaint is that they do not validate parking here, and there really isn't anywhere close to park unless you luck out at a street spot which are few and far between.   Sauce wise, my personal favorites are Caribbean jerk, Asian zing, mango habanero (sweet heat x 100), and garlic Parmesan. Getting these almost anything, weather wings or a wrap, are a sure way to have good tasting food. As far as sides go, 10/10 would get the potato wedges over anything. These things are like crack when dipped in ranch.",

No one working here cares about the customer...AT ALL!  First visit was about 10pm on a Tuesday night where the entire table got boneless wings. 30 mins later they arrived. Once food was dropped off, waitress disappeared. Asked another employee to track her down, he kindly said ok but then proceeded to resume his sweeping duties (thanks a lot!) so we had to get up to find her for refills.  Second trip was lunchtime on Saturday (ACC Men's tourney championship day 3/16/19). Appears they're short staffed because quite a bit of open tables yet told 15-20 mins to wait. Was told by another patron waiting that we shouldn't bother because they've been ignored for so long they're leaving. Really disturbing to hear she was ignored considering she was pushing someone in a wheel chair. Decided to sit at bar instead for the no wait. 10 mins passed before asked what we'd like for drinks. To avoid the long time gap again, we placed food order when she brought our drinks (12:55 pm). Food arrives at 1:20 (wings, burger, and salads). Told bartender we almost walked out because of the wait time. She kind of chuckled and stated it wouldn't effect her if we had. Burger was cold and didn't have the number of patties on it as stated in menu. When I pointed it out to the bartender she says, \"they must've changed the menu\" lol. She asks me if I'd like the other patty...I'm thinking to myself why would I? This one took 25 mins and it's cold...I'll pass. Asked for a discount since it wasn't what I ordered from menu. Got 15% off...guess better than nothing.  So many restaurants around so save yourself a headache and go there instead. This place is terribly managed and no one cares about you.  YELP needs to allow negative stars cause this place would get them.",

So I let it go and Doordash gives me my credit to the account for the money... The story doesn't stop there.. I place my order through doordash during the WEEKEND.. they do not close until 1AM. I placed my order at about maybe 11:40 or whatever it says in my screenshots. Time is going by, 30 minutes... 50.. an hour.. So I text my doordash person and he tells me that he's been standing in line for an hour to pick up my food and says there was some DRAMA going down inside?? I called and asked what was going on and etc and everyone sounded so shaken up and from what it sound like from the background noise, they didn't have my order even ready when I felt the intensity over the phone when they realized I'm a bit pissed..

I came here to grab a small bite, and the first thing when I came in inside the restaurant was the bad smell, like old grease type smell, I don't know how to describe it but is simply bad enough that my it took my aperture away and I ended up giving it a chance anyway by taking a carry out order since I was already here and was going to go back and eat at my hotel. In summary: The food awful: ordered chicken wrap and  -the tortillas were cold and felt old.  -The food inside was super cold -the sauce was cold -the cheese tasted weird -the fries tastes mediocre at best and was a pretty small amount what they put. -the tables outside were super dirty, and I chose the less dirty one (see photo) -I left feeling sick in my stomach -Don't come here unless you have very low expectations or just grabbing high fat and high calorie wings.  I hope they do something about this place because I know there are some good BWW in other cities.",

I typically avoid places like this, but since my coworker was adventurous for lunch and had some craft beers with me (instead of Bud Light or Mich Ultra) I let him pick the dinner spot. He was talking about this place all day so I knew this is where we would end up.   The place was absolutely packed with people. The food was good but nothing great. Brian did a great job taking care of us. He was extremely busy but still never let our water glasses or beer glasses get empty. That is all I ask of a server. And to do that on a busy night is even harder, so he gets all 5 stars here. Not much to add about the place itself, just a shout out to a great server. Ask for him if you go.",

Refused to apologize or make it right.  Argued loudly with me in front of other customers, allowed employees to disrespect our party, and tried to hide from me when I complained.

Who wants soggy, rubbery chicken wings? This is not how they are supposed to come. We did get a new order, though, which was better. I almost always get the dry rub sauces & there was hardly any on my wings. The amount of sauce you get seems to differ from place to place which seems like a problem with training.

Went here after a Panther's home game to have some drinks, wings, and catch a few of the other games on the TVs. Requested the patio and were walked halfway through the restaurant before the hostess just pointed, \"it's back there\". Well yeah, we were just there except there was a huge sign that directed us to the hostess stand to be seated. We sat ourselves and sat, and sat, and sat. We watched as three servers moved through the section, looked at our table and walked away. Shift change and they didn't want another table? After about ten minutes, the manager stopped by to see if we had been helped. We ordered through him because we didn't know when we would actually see another server. About ten minutes after that, Orlando stopped by to verify our order. You mean you haven't even put our order in? Rather than get drinks, cause who knew when we would get them, I ordered a Coke.. Which I never got. Food arrived (cold) and I asked for extra sauce. My girlfriend realized she also wanted extra spice just a minute after he left the table, so she pulled one of the other servers aside to ask for more water and a side of the salt and vinegar spice. The sauce came at about the time that I was finishing my last wing. Orlando asked if we wanted boxes, I said yes, my girlfriend AGAIN requested a side of the salt and vinegar spice. Waters were never refilled. Ever try eating hot wings with no water? I was chewing on my ice. The manager stopped by as I was finishing my glass of ice to see if we wanted more water. Actually, we wanted water refills, a Coke.. on second though nix the Coke, a side of salt and vinegar spice, a box, and a check. Orlando made his third appearance at our table with the check. The patio was half empty. There were five tables between three servers.. Although one of the servers had her family in her station, so she spent her time chatting with her one and only table. Seriously? Give me hot food and keep my drink full, that's all I ask at a sports bar.. apparently, too much to ask at BWW.   Visited October 2011",

The location is a bit off the beaten path for \"uptown\" Charlotte.  But, if you are in the Wachovia/Wells Fargo end of town, it is an easy walk.  All the standard BWW fare is here.  Try the Asian Zing sauce- as they say, its where Sweet meets heat.  Street Parking may be a challenge, but ample deck parking is available at the HOF and nearby. Or, ride the light rail in, and walk a couple blocks to the NASCAR HOF.",

I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, and the chicken definitely had the texture and consistency of frozen food that was reheated (probably in the microwave). The buffalo sauce was squirted on top of the chicken like ketchup. In my experience, the chicken is traditionally marinated/cooked in the sauce, so the flavor can permeate the meat. Also the french fries were cold. The servers seemed more interested in having conversations with each other than helping us. They did not offer us any beer specials, which I find disappointing at a sports bar. Perhaps this is why the restaurant was completely empty. I would never go there again.",

Restaurants need to stop thinking that memorizing orders is impressive or efficient. With human error being high, orders will be wrong, as mine was not correct at all. I was not about wait any longer to have them bring the correct order. For a rather large restaurant, surprised to see they were using the NASCAR Hall of Fame restrooms as their own, rather than having separate ones. Tables not clean and we were rarely visited by our waitress, during a slow period. I realize that their attire is based on football, but when connected to a NASCAR place, maybe on race days, they should be wearing race car team shirts at this particular one. Charlotte has many great restaurants, so I suggest to go elsewhere, until they can get their act together at this one.",

Then when I got home (I'm so dumb for not checking my bag) I noticed the 2 ranches and 2 carrot sides I ordered were not even in the bag. So annoying because I don't even like wings without ranch...  Then comes the best part. I open one of my snack sized boneless wings and.... they're so gross. Tiniest crispiest things ever.

We parked in the garage next door for $18/day. We walked in around 4pm. The place was not busy at all, just a few customers dining.   Before I get to the food, I would like to give credit to our server, Hollie. She was very professional, attentive, and helpful from start to finish. I would give her 5 stars easily! She provided excellent service.   Now, for the food. We ordered: Crispy chicken tenders (4-piece) with cheese curds on the side $8.99 Kids medium wings with a side of fries $4.69 Ginger ale $2.89 Sweet tea $2.89  I was pleasantly surprised with my chicken tenders. The meat was juicy. The cheese curds were tiny cheese cubes dipped in batter and fried. I enjoyed that as well. The tea was plenty sweet. My son loves hot wings and was very pleased with his entree. His kids entree came with 4 wings, which was enough for him as well as a side of fries. The fries were just okay.  For a restaurant with only a 2-star rating, I walked in with very low expectations. However, I walked out with better. Although the food isn't mind blowing, we had a good dining experience.",

Where do I start? Well for one I've only ever had take-out from here but every time I walk in I see tables that appear to be empty and filled with the previous guests discards. The staff is friendly and prompt but there seems to be a lack of structure amongst them as I constantly see a disorganized bunch trying to figure out who's working the door or front desk or who has table 3... the cleanest part of this restaurant is the bathrooms which they share with the nascar building so I'm sure they have little to do with the upkeep. The food is hardly ever hot but seems to always come out luke warm and on the verge of being cold. I like this spot but I think they might be due for new management. You could bring your family here but don't ever take a date.",

    "text": "Horrible customer service experience!!!  I placed an online order. I came in to pick it up. Walked up to the front counter to find an employee on the phone. The employee could have been calculating something for a previous order. Who knows.  THE ISSUE: This employee didn't look up from the phone for 30 seconds. Then they looked up and saw me BUT LOOKED BACK AT THEIR PHONE (as if I was an invisible ghost).   After 10 more seconds I asked: \"Do I need to go to the bar????\"  The employee responded: \"Oh. Do you need to place an order?\"  I responded: \"No, I'm picking up an order.\"  Then the employee says: \"Oh someone will be over in a second.\" (And walks away to the kitchen...but not to find any help).  A minute later, another employee walks by and asks if I need help. Finally. He's gets my order from the kitchen. I pay. I leave.  This was absurd. I wasn't rude. I wasn't asking for the moon. I just wanted some kind of acknowledgement. Is that too much to ask! Is your phone conversation that important? Am i invisible? Better question: \"What is the interview process like at BWW's? Where's the ACCOUNTABILITY? Where's the customer service.",

We came in the patio door which didn't have anyone around to direct us to the front door, but we found our way without help yet loads of employees talking to each other (too loudly).  Got seated quickly and after a little time without any server coming over we got our order done. Food came out quickly and dropped off by the runner. I do expect our server to actually come over and check to make sure our food is correct and maybe some a drink refill. Ours on the other hand was talking to other employees which seems very typical here.  We also were somewhat close to the kitchen door and it seemed like it had a screeching sound for every person who came through to the point of distraction! Fix the door guys!!  The food was good and the kitchen was doing a great job, probably because the manager was spending his time watching them while the front of the house stood around talking too much!  Spend some time and find someplace else unless you just want a wing fix.",

    "text": "I can't even believe I'm reviewing a Buffalo Wild Wings. You are all witnessing what can only be described as a low point in my Yelping. Ugh, ok, let's just get this over with.  First of all, why did I even come here? Because it was Friday night and my family wanted to go out and my dad hates any place with live music, crowds, noise, and \"lots of energy.\" So Buffalo Wild Wings is the perfect place to go if you hate people and fun, basically. And my brother wanted to go here because they have trivia, which by the way is also not fun because if I am one thing I am fucking competitive and I hate losing and will go out of my way to try to ruin the fun for everyone else if I do. Also the game itself is full of either esoteric questions or totally obvious ones and if you wait long enough they give you the answer. Total bullshit.   Oh so the restaurant itself I'm pretty sure is segregated. The hostess insisted that we sit at the bar even though the front dining area had plenty of tables open because she said there were only two waitresses for that area and they were already busy. So we walked through there and pretty much everybody was black. The bar had some people in it and (you should expect this if you've been reading carefully) they were all white. Probably a total coincidence. I'm not really sure but I'd guess Yelp might frown upon such a nonchalant accusation of segregation.  The only other time I've been to a Buffalo Wild Wings was in high school when I went with my friend Katie and these twins, Greg and whatever the gay one's name was. All I remember from that was the twins were really hot and I had a thing for Greg and didn't find out until January when I visited Katie in Brooklyn that a) Greg is her roommate now and b) he totally had a thing for me, too. So when we reunited we hella made out and I know my ex-boyfriend doesn't read this but if he does I might as well come clean about also making out with 3 other guys early on in our relationship because that's what you get when you date me for 5 months and refuse to acknowledge me as your girlfriend, asshole! This entire paragraph has nothing to do with this restaurant but whatever if I want to use Yelp as my diary I DAMN WILL.   So anyway we ordered like 25 wings for the table and I'll just cut to the chase, they sucked. I asked the waitress if they had anything that they didn't deep fry and she replied, \"Everything is fried.\" So I ate all this fried greasy food and felt horrible and my old college/post-college/occasionally current bulimia habit kicked in because I just didn't want that shit in my body. That is how bad Buffalo Wild Wings is. Fuck now I wish I would not have told my mom about Yelp because she reads my reviews now I guess. She said some of them are funny. SOME OF THEM?? She also says I'm \"too sarcastic so that I can sound edgy\" and to that I say you may be right but Yelp reviews are the only things keeping me from pulling the trigger on the Beretta I put to my forehead every night before bed, so just let me do this the way I want. Man, that was really dark. Now THAT'S edgy!  Wow what the hell was I even talking about? Oh yeah, I didn't like the wings here.",

Been to this BWW twice now and pretty much had the same experience both times. We weren't greeted when we first walked in, instead we received a dirty stare from the two female servers standing at the hostess stand. We brushed it off and actually did their job for them by friendly greeting them, \"Hi, how are you? Table for 6 please.\" Seated a few moments later. Inexperienced waiter. Plenty of room for improvements needed on the waitstaff. Perhaps they should enforce stricter management or emphasize the fact that customers needs more attention from them rather than their phones or socializing amongst each other. The entire restaurant had possibly 5 tables AT MOST during the times of our visits. Our food took at least 30 minutes both times, had a messed up order (didn't complain, brushed it off as well), and by the time we received it the food looked as though it's been sitting out for a bit. Overall, I wouldn't choose to come to this BWW if it wasn't the last resort. Two stars were generously given just for their sanitation and the fact that we received food at all.",

We asked multiple times to speak with the manager and we were ignored. Our server, Ashley, was amazing. She was the one positive thing during lunch that day although it was painful to watch her be ignored and yelled at by the manager because she asked him to come speak with our table. She tried numerous times to speed up our order without success. I was there for Mary Kay Career Conference and we missed part of the conference because of our choice to go to this restaurant.

We had two servers - one just left or something part way through without telling us she would no longer be our server. It seemed painfully obvious that she did not really want to be there and was very slow overall. Perhaps she was having a bad day.The second did a much better job and he was polite.   They had two \"specials\" $5 fat tires and $3.50 tall boy coors lights (Thursday). They also have 60 cent boneless wings.  The drinks were fine the wings kind of lackluster. One of our boneless bites didn't actually have meat in it - just breading. I tried several flavors but I enjoyed the bbq best- they are not shy with the spice factor so hot is hot .Living in Buffalo makes me a huge wing snob so my expectations were not particularly high in the first place.   My meal and drink was $10- not too bad.Overall even though id have better I would go back but probably not on my own accord.   Also parking is a huge pain- better off taking the light rail in or preparing for a little walk if you don't want to pay the $6 parking fee.",

Fortunately they brought us out an extra 5 wings with one of the right flavors. Another server gave us 2 ranches before asking what dip we wanted, and j asked her for a blue cheese. She delivered it via a passive aggressive slide across the table. I said thank you and she walked away without a word or glance. When our server asked me if I wanted a refill of my lemonade, I said sure and she grabbed it and began walking off. I caught her before she managed to dip around the corner and asked if they were free refills, and she said no. I said she could've told me that, and she had no response and walked away. A clear attempt at racking up our bill with no sign of remorse when caught. Spinach dip was dank though.",

Love the taste of the Thai hot sauce, they do sell it in bottles so one could make their own wings if health conscious.  Their wings is deep fried, obviously.  Sandwiches are okay, just the regular taste and so are the nachos.  We found ordering over phone and picking it up was quicker than placing the order after you sit in the restaurant.",

    "text": "Came in with my adult son to have a bite to eat and a drink and watch UFC. Came in and the place was empty. We were pleasantly greeted by a waitress, I remember saying to my son how pleasant she was. AND it went completely downhill from there.   I'm assuming our waitress was new, and I get that everyone needs practice, but this tops it all. Let me tell you how it went...  So again, greeted pleasantly. My son asked if they had lemonade, waitress said yes, and my son asked if he could have a pink lemonade, and she wrote it down, said yes, and asked for my drink. I asked for Blueberry Mint Lemonade, she didn't know if they had it and wanted me to show her on the menu. I did, and even gave a back up order if they didn't... A pink lemonade like my son. Drinks come back, my son got a plain lemonade and I got my Blueberry Mint Lemonade. Although we said Pink Lemonade twice, we let it go. Strike 1.  Waitress comes to our table 3 separate times asking to take our order. we decided on 2 appetizers, as I was only staying a short bit, but my son was staying late for the UFC main fight. We ordered Chips and Queso & Fries. Chips and Queso came fairly quickly. We eat them, wondering how long are the fries going to take. Waitress comes by to see how we're doing, and we are fine. Then again, comes by, and asks to take our order. I explain we will wait to place an order for a bit until we see how we are feeling after the Chips and Queso & Fries. She appears to understand and walks away. More time goes by, we've finished our drinks and still no fries. She's comes by and I ask how long til the fries come out. Her reply was \"what fries\"? I explained I ordered them at the same time as the other item. She quickly replied that she only put in for the Chips and Queso. Which is already very clear. Strike 2. I ask if she can put in an order for them now. She agreed and walked away without asking if we wanted refills on our drinks. She does come back shortly after and refills my son's plain lemonade but no smile, no word, just straight silence and dry face even after my son says thank you. Now she wants to be pissy? Strike 3.   Someone else brings our fries. Great. Waitress comes by ever so pleasant checking to see if our fries came. Now I'm thinking her pleasantness is fake. We finish our fries, and I'm wanting to place a to-go order and walk back to the hotel. She walked by many times not stopping by to check on us. She even would cut through a skinny space between a pillar and a table and chairs to avoid walking by our booth. Finally, as I see her coming, I raise my arm full length and speak outwardly to her, \" can I get your attention?\" But she walked right by me as I spoke. My son and I were amazed that she did this. Strike 4.  We wait and wait and finally she stops by. I explain I want to place an order to-go and pay the full bill, as I'm leaving but my son is staying. I inquire about how many traditional wings come in a snack size. She answers, \"five\". Perfect, I place my order for 2 salads and a snack size of mild wings. Her response was, \"traditional or boneless?\". I repeat that I wanted traditional. I made nice, paid my bill, and waited and waited, and waited for my to-go order. Strike 5.  Get my food, and I leave. I walk the 1/4 mile back to my hotel. Notice we don't have any plastic utensils for our to-go order. Oh well, so I ask for some at my hotel. Get up to my room and pull out the salad, and both Caesar salads are dry. No dressing. No packets. No anything. Strike 6.   Highly suggest if you go here, do not let \"Ashley\" be your waitress.",

Awful customer service and the only explanation was \"I'm not sure what the problem was\". After receiving our food, the food was incorrect and had to be taken back to the kitchen to be corrected. Spoke with manager, who didn't even offer any kind of service recovery (40 minutes after our food order was to be due) until we asked for our food for free or severely discounted. We were answered with \"oh I can only give you a discount\" (15-20% I believe). Flustered, we accepted the discount because we didn't want to let the food go to waste and at this point we were quite hungry. We get home and realize, we paid full price - the manager didn't even honor the discount he offered!!!! We were not an isolated incident, most of the fellow diners were upset and outraged as well. We've gone to Buffalo Wild Wings in the past with perfectly fine experiences but we will never be going to another BWW again. Wild Wing from here on out!",

HIRE A NEW STAFF. Read what the community and public is writing on YOUR restaurant. Take pride and fire those lazy workers. They are useless and an embarrassment. SO LAZY.  My boyfriend and I walked in and nobody even acknowledged us. It took about 4-5 minutes for the talking hostess to stop talking to other employees to even say anything to us and the worse part?, she was standing right in front of the hostess stand.   So at this point I'm already super annoyed!  We told them we were going to have 6 people altogether so they sat us outside. After getting a phone call that two people were no longer joining us, we went inside to ask them if we could get a table inside for a 4 top now. They had no idea what the word \"Top\" meant. If you're going to be working at a restaurant, please learn some restaurant terminology!!!!!! So after giving me blank stares, I kindly say ...\"We no longer have 2 people coming in, may we have a seat inside for 4 people?\" and the guy looks at the other 5 talking hostesses and says \"Uh, I thought you said you wanted 6 people??\". Like.... what the hell?? I am literally telling you that two people are no longer coming, don't come back at me and say that to me. I, the customer, am telling you, the server, what I want. Don't say \"I thought ..\" like, that is super unprofessional.  And to top it all off, my wings were super dry and old. I've worked in a kitchen for the past couple of years so I DEFINITELY  know they're old so please, don't tell me they weren't old! Plus, it was Football Sunday so I KNOW the fryer guy had extra wings just sitting in a bowl waiting to be coated with whatever sauces he needed. Like, I get that it's going to be super busy for Football Sunday, but you never know who you're going to serve. Like, ew.  HORRIBLE STAFF, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE. I hope everyone gets fired.",

We found that strange, but then overheard the hostess telling incoming customers that they were free to order drinks, but the wait on food was \"over an hour.\" FOR WINGS? Never. Also, would have been nice if we had been provided that information when we walked in--we definitely would not have stayed to order. Total waste of time.",

Place was pretty much empty and the host said he can turn to the game. I sat there for 10 mins waiting meanwhile watching him F off. Eventually I went up to him and said remember me. He's like sir your gonna have to be patient. An argument ensued and he's like sir your gonna have to find another place to eat. I hadn't had a drink, just waiting for them to turn to a different game. He was wrong for that.",

The server we had was pretty attentive but couldn't help noticing the other waiters and waitresses joking and laughing in the corner and checking their phones. My food came out wrong but the waiter took it back and made it right with no problem he also checked on us regularly. When we were leaving I stopped at the front desk to get a bag for my left overs and THREE staff walked past me, made eye contact and did not say a word. One young waitress who was carrying a tray full of dirty dishes stopped and asked did I need help and put the tray down to give me a bag and waited on the customers behind me. Thumbs up to her!!. Probably will not go back, this restaurant needs better management.",

    "text": "I had a semi bad experience here. First off we waited about 20 minutes to be seated. I ordered cheese sticks to offset the waiting time because we ordered chicken and it didnt matter, as everything came out together. Part of the order was wrong, so we eat our cheese sticks and popcorn shrimp only. We decided to cancel the rest of the order since it took 35 minutes to get our food in the first place. The waitress gave us drinks when we first arrived but failed to check on us for refills....I ended up slurping my lemon water to the very bottom. I will not be coming back here for least 6 months as I will drive the extra miles to another BWW to get better service!",

I waited... and waited ... and waited for 25 minutes while watching  four waitresses walk by me .... not one of them asked if I'd been helped. Then the same hostess walked by and looked at me ... clearly realizing that after so much time passed I still hadn't been helped. She immediately came to my table asked if anyone helped, then took my order. She brought out my food and occasionally checked up me. She was awesome! Although the boneless wings tasted like they were two days old I didn't  complain simply because the hostess was so nice! She would be the only reason that I would change this one star to a five .... if you eat here  I'd suggest asking for Dee (detoria)  the hostess to be your waitress",

I bought 40 wings, a side of Cole slaw and a basket of fries this last time, and I also paid for EXTRA ranch (like the big containers)I was only given 3 tiny containers of ranch. What am I supposed to do with that? Give everyone a tiny drop of ranch?!  When I asked where the 3 big ranch's were he said they ran out of the big containers, but yet he charged me for the big containers of ranch.  He kept rushing me and trying to help someone else when I was still pointing out what I was missing. Paid for 40 wings, Cole slaw, basket of fries, and 5 ranch containers.  It's ridiculous how much they charge for sauce when they don't even give it to you.",

I'm sorry but if you are going to earn my business at least own up when you are in the wrong.
