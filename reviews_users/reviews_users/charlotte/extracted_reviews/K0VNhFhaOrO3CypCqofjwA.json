    "text": "First let me qualify that I wish there was a 3.5 star option.  Also despite the criticism of this review- I will still support this establishment for their amazing vision!  Having said that, I do wish this place was more consistent.  Whether you order the Kung Pao Chkn from the regular menu (10.99) or the all day combo menu (7.99) you disappointingly get the exact same amount.  I was excited for the drumsticks but this week they were over cooked and greasesticks.  Veggies always taste fresh and your food isnt drowned in cornstarch filled sauces- but I just find the value for the prices are very inconsistent.  It cost me over 22 bucks for a combo and drumsticks-  Perhaps offer more options for customers that may want to try an app without paying a price that is significantly higher than main courses.",

We ordered the Peking duck, the fish in tomato and mushroom sauce, and the kung pao chicken.  We also had an order of potstickers.  Everything tastes very fresh and delicious!  I think the crowd favorite was the Peking duck.  Everything was reasonably priced, we didn't have to wait long, and the people working there were very friendly.  If I lived in Charlotte, I would be there all the time!",

I ordered the sesame chicken, which was okay, but kind of crunchy like real Chinese food. Which is something I always hated. My omni husband got the sweet and spicy chicken and veggies. There was barely any chicken and he didn't like it very much. He's very open minded and likes almost every fake meat he's tried. The owners were very nice and accommodating and made him a side order of sweet and sour chicken and it was disgusting. Sorry :( I feel bad because they were so nice. But we both tried it and spit it out. It was mushy. The spring rolls were good. I would probably go back and give it another chance. My meal was okay, and the owners were very sweet but over all I was disappointed. I still support them and appreciate their business.",

Everything they serve is vegetarian and most menu items are vegan. I had the beef & broccoli and it was fantastic. The broccoli was not overcooked; it had a crunch that made me happy. The beef was very realistic. In fact, I pondered if it was real meat and reminded myself that it is an entirely vegetarian restaurant. The sauce was a bit sweet, but that's normal these days. I got the fried rice, which had a slightly smoky flavor. Overall, it was a great tasting meal.   The prices are definitely higher than a normal Chinese restaurant, but they are in line with other vegetarian restaurants such as Bean. One advantage of this restaurant over a normal Chinese restaurant is not having to worry about your food cooking on the same griddle as meat and not having chicken wings fried in the same oil as your spring roll. The waitresses were all super nice and the place was very clean.   I'm very happy to have another vegetarian restaurant in Charlotte and looking forward to eating there again.",

I soon called in to yell at the lady because the groupon showed as used but there was no food so I called in to demand to call groupon and they released my food. Why are you on groupon if you don't know how to use it!!!?! They also don't speak good English at all so they'll put up a fight just because they think they're right! Please don't believe the other reviews unless you really can't afford to eat at upper scale restaurants .. I don't know if they got mad and peed in my food or what but the food does NOT taste good it has a very off taste the lemon fish squares were extremely tiny and the rice was god awful like if you're really use to eating upscale food then don't try this place because you'll be able to notice the difference in quality.

I counted 5 thin slices of over fried tofu with just 2 broccoli and 3 celery. Come on y'all American Chinese food does not run a high food cost at all. Even the rice that came with it was small amount. The  Wonton soup was okay today. Sorry folks just now worth it to me. Just becuase I'm Vegan dosen't mean I haveto blindly love this place.",

My one issue is that most items are a mock meat. As a strict vegetarian, I'm not trying to replicate a meat taste. This is True for most Indians who are vegetarian. There aren't any descriptions of what these mock meats are (i.e. tofu, seitan, wheat gluten) so I don't venture out from just getting a basic tofu dish. If they just added a sheet to the menu with descriptions of the \"meats\" that would be very helpful and get me more comfortable with trying more items from the extensive menu.",

It's always been a favorite soup for me, but have not had it since living in Charlotte,  because I eat a plant based diet. I'm so happy to have that flavor back!  The Peking Duck (I asked for their vegan version) is automatically one of my favorite things.  The people are beautifully kind. I really feel like a guest, not a customer.   Clean! I'm here late, near closing, and they are cleaning in places I know most restaurants don't. They are moving things and getting behind things. I just watched a man clean the door knobs to the rest room. Very impressed.  Whether you eat a plant based/cruelty free diet, or not, this is a \"must try\" restaurant.",

The food took a little time to get to, this all the more indicates that there's a lot of love in its preparation. Compared to its earlier dishes as a regular Chinese restaurant, I can definitely tell the difference in quality as a fully vegetarian restaurant. The ingredient and preparations are much lighter and healthier while maintaining a good sense of taste. I had a vegetarian curry chicken(imitation meat) and felt just as satisfied.   Overall 5 stars all the way, I would definitely come back to try more of their dishes! Great price for great vegetarian food!",

We were drawn here based on my reading a Yelp review that told of it being vegan and vegetarian.  Their menu includes sesame chicken, but all meat is vegetarian.   There were a lot of vegan and vegetarian offerings on the menu.  Seemed entirely authentic as two Chinese women helped us at the counter and their English was difficult to understand.   For a minute, I thought I was in China.   Eating Chinese food at home at 10:00 pm was certainly out of the box for us.  The food ended up being just so so. There was a lot of grease. Perhaps we are so used to Thai and Vietnamese food now and this just seemed not as healthful.    I will give them the benefit of doubt since we poked our heads in the door just before closing.  It probably was not their best culinary performance.",

    "text": "Excellent vegetarian and vegan options, so delicious that even meat eaters can enjoy! My boyfriend and I don't eat meat and usually have to resort to tofu and veggies at Chinese restaurants, which is tasty but nothing special. But then we heard of the amazing array of meatless Chinese cuisine at Ma Ma Wok and had to try! We absolutely loved it!! First off, the staff was all very friendly which is big in my book. Then we had delicious lettuce wraps with vegetarian ham. We then had two vegan chicken entrees. They really tasted like chicken and the sauces had wonderful flavor.   Please keep an open mind. This food is very delicious and I used to eat meat. Animal products do not need to be part of your meal. If you read about the treatment of innocent animals on factory farms, the environmental impact of meat and dairy consumption (global warming) and all the hormones and junk that goes into most animal products, you can then see that eating a more plant based diet is the way of the future.",

Coming from NYC Chinatown Mecca,  I recommend these Abundance attracts greater abundance ideas:  1- try to make more things Organic on menu!  2- Portions sizes are ok but should be LARGER and more  generous for the price, and quality of ambience . 3- Like many restaurants offer today ...Create a Mama Wok loyalty club for every $150 get $10 back.  Being generous attracts more generosity.    4/23/18 ~We have been trying out different things consistently here , and as such the only qualms I have besides not being organic for the prices are portion sizes~ We used to believe REDBOWL was pricey but you always always received a great portion for each dish- although the \"faux chicken/meat\" with asparagus here is one of the more expensive dishes,imho,  it gives you like very little  of any of the faux anything ...mostly vegetables for not a faux price!  Beings business man myself I always prefer feeling like my meal was worth it when we eat out vegan or not   We have had take out here twice recently ... ~ Food is very good. Tasty and flavorful. ~ portion sizes are average. ~ Vegan quality is good, and fresh! ~  interior is a typical basic Chinese restaurant. ~No eggs dairy, msg or oversalty. -  staff is friendly.  ~ Business practices- hmmm - On this last take-out order of $60, we ordered \"brown rice\" with everything only to arrive 30 mins later to pick up , and find out that they didn't have any brown rice for ALL 4 of our entrees ...only whita rice! No phone call or warning or courtesy-  So you be the judge?! I will Update in the near future based on more experiences.",

By the time I had realized that it was a vegan place, it was too late and my order was in. They should indicate in the name of the restaurant that it is a vegan place, because without reading the Yelp reviews, it looks like they offer vegan OPTIONS, not that vegan options are the ONLY options. Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed when I ate my \"meat.\" I had the Sesame Chicken combo, which comes with broccoli and fried rice for $7.99. It's a great portion, but the \"meat\" tasted like tofu with every bite. The fried rice was also too dry and lacked flavor. Even the boyfriend noticed that the meat did not taste right. He had the General Tso's Chicken combo, also $7.99. It tasted like puffs of air. Staff was very nice and polite, and they were very quick with our orders, but I wish it was made much more obvious that the cuisine is vegan - name it something along the lines of \"Ma Ma Vegan Wok.\"",

As a a pesca-vegan, I wanted to surprise my mom by not telling her the meat was fake. But this inedible concoction was not the kind of surprise I intended.   Sorry, mom.   Perhaps we shouldn't have arrived 15 minutes before lunch closing.  At the very least, the food should match the menu description. Their sweet n' sour \"chicken\" contained potato instead of pineapple (as listed). Whyyy. My dish contained a minuscule amount of UFOs (Unidentified Food Objects), making this a particularly tragic substitution choice.   My mother's cashew \"chicken\", on the other hand, was worse--and didn't even have cashews. The scarce amount of chicken she did have looked like shaved tofu, opposed to more normalized bits of chicken or even fake meat, which I can attest to in Los Angeles. 75% of her order was vegetables, unlike mine, which she describes as \"a cross between sinewy muscle and tree branches.\"  Ma Ma Wok gives plant-based a whole new meaning.

Our favorite combination is ordering the Udon Noodles with \"beef\" and asking very nicely for something off-menu... mu shu pork.  The cabbage and veg from the mu shu seems to go perfectly on top of the udon noodles. The are meant to be together in our hearts and in our stomachs.   We have also enjoyed the special noodle soup (see specials and drawing on the table), the dry sauteed green beans, and the asparagus chicken and veg dish.   The only 'miss' for me was the zhajiungmian (might be spelling it wrong) on the specials board. It was noodles with a thick sauce on it and I really prefer dishes with more veggies in them. Not something I'll revisit... we have a huge menu to get through!   Oh and my Omni brother in law is obsessed with the sesame \"chicken\". Kudos",

Choose tofu if faux meats are not your thing, and keep in mind that sodas come in plastic bottles and their takeaway containers are Styrofoam. Sugg: order the dumplings!  Vegan here, I would absolutely come again. Visited for a weeknight dinner with my omnivorous SO, who loved each dish just as much as I did (he's familiar with faux meats from my cooking, so no surprises there).  App: The dumplings are very tasty, clearly handmade.   Entree: We ordered the \"chicken\" curry by staff recommendation, which had many lovely veggies, some fried tofu, and some faux \"chicken\" slices. My SO ordered the kung pao \"beef\", which had a lot of broccoli and some peanuts. The faux \"beef\" had a bit of an anise hint to it, which isn't my favorite, but it grew on me the more I ate it. Both of these entrees came with rice. If you're concerned about eating faux meats, you can't go wrong with old-school fried tofu.   Dessert: We couldn't resist an order of the freshly fried Chinese donuts, which were nicely crisped on the outside and so soft and fluffy on the inside. It's a big order though, and hard for 2 people to finish after all the other food we ordered. I ate the rest at home with jam, but they do lose their crispness if you eat them later, FYI.",

    "text": "So happy there is a vegan/vegetarian Chinese restaurant now! I got referred by a co worker and told my boyfriend about it. He went the day before me and had TWO plates by himself (that's how good it was) cashew chicken and general chicken. He said both were very good.  so me and my dad came to try.   We both got the sesame veg chicken combo with rice and spring roll. It was so good! I haven't had real chicken in forever, and it was awesome to get something other than veggies at a Chinese restaurant that was actually DELICIOUS! We will definitely be back. Best vegan Chinese food for a great price!",

    "text": "It's refreshing to find Vegan Chinese food and close to home. This place is super yummy, there are a lot of angry past customers who miss their fried wings and other non Vegan dishes that were sold prior to the restaurants conversion to fully Vegan menu so the reviews will vary until the TRUE Vegan fan base learn about this place as angry birds will have not nice things to say.  Our toddler has never been a big meat eater he is always forced to try meat by my husband. I just have always made high Protein non meat items for him and I as prior to my Vegan conversion I was a Pescatarian 2 Days a week and a Vegetarian 5 Days a week for 10 years so I understood his no desire for meat as I didn't eat much pregnant with him (only occasional seafood).  Our son really enjoyed the Vegetarian Fried Rice which he shared with my husband both visits we've made here. He also enjoys the appetizer Lemon Fish cakes which are yummy. My husband and I always get the Spring roll appetizer as well to share. I've had the asparagus chicken which was super yummy and just recently on our latest visit I tried asparagus fish and wasn't disappointed at all. It had be same yummy light taste and flavorful which is much appreciate as people think Vegan food lacks flavor but it DOESN'T. Ooh let's not forget the Mushroom Dim Sum Vegan soup the owner gave me as she LOVES that my son LOVES Vegan food and that I'm nourishing a PlantBased baby in my tummy so she always looking out for me.",

If all vegan food tasted like the food at Ma Ma Wok, I would go vegan in a heartbeat. The effort to achieve authenticity and love in each ingredient in the dishes we had were amazing! I honestly didn't know I wasn't having just plain delicious Americanized Chinese food. My wife, who is vegan, was dumbfounded that the food she was eating was 100% vegan.  Vegan or not, I cannot emphasize enough how everyone should come and try this place. Plus the service there is without a doubt some of the best, customer-centric service you can find. Super welcoming staff and obviously know how to reach more than just the vegan audience. We'd be in serious trouble if this was closer to Charlotte proper....",

Food was very tasty without the often bloated taste you may get from other Chinese restaurants. Entree choices rivaled any non-vegan restaurant.   I like how the restaurant is bright with natural light. It made it a very enjoyable experience.  My only disappointment was the \"pork\" bun. Some things, you just have to have the real thing.

I had the wonton soup and sesame tofu. I understand now the difference between saying I want sesame tofu vs sesame veg meat. I will try the meat one next but I always gravitate to sesame tofu when I eat at other meat established asian places... But i also only eat chinese if they have a vegetarian option. While I am not a vegetarian I often select vegetarian choices esp with Asian restaurants. Wonton soup was very flavorful and no mystery meat in there... Really good. Sesame tofu was flavorful. Wish it had some more sauce. I drove 26 mins here for takeout and I would for sure do it again!!",

My husband and I got a carry out order(in the middle of the lunch rush) of Lo Mein and General Tso's veg meat. Both dishes were AMAZING!!! The Lo Mein is, hands down, THE BEST Lo Mein we've ever had from any Chinese restaurant in the Charlotte area. The general tso's was very tasty and quite convincing of \"real\" meat. It also came with a side of rice, which was moist and went great with general tso's sauce.   The service was fast and courteous. And the food was packaged neatly and still hot once we got it home. We will definitely be back to try more dishes from this unique Chinese restaurant.",

The two ladies who work out front were indeed very friendly and the food was prepared quickly and arrived piping hot.  I was particularly pleased with the perfectly cooked broccoli which arrived bright green and crunchy, instead of being overcooked like so many other places. The fried rice was also very good. The chicken however was thinly sliced, almost like lunch meat. Not that I didn't like it I mind you, it was just different.  I was also impressed with their upgraded dining room and with this 98 sanitation grade.   At a time when so many of my favorite long-time restaurants seem to be slacking off and falling by the wayside, I'm glad to see at least one going in the opposite direction.",

Super un-assuming... and easy to miss...   Small dining area.. probably five booths around the perimeter and then tables in the center of the restaurant.  The service was excellent and very polite... we didn't have a dedicated server (my guess here is it is \"all hands on deck\" 24/7 so everyone gets taken care of).    I was super blown away at the menu (with pictures).  It was super helpful especially since the menu still listed \"chicken, beef, pork, etc\"  but its not... it was almost like a magic show with food!  Probably my favorite part is that each table had a hand-drawn \"recommendations\" card... of which I took each of those recommendations to heart.  Ordered the fried wantons (based off the hand drawn placard) and the General Tso Tofu... came with your choice of rice.  OMG super tasty and delicious... I had a friend that ordered the BBQ Pork Buns and the Zhajiangmian noodle.  I'll let the photos speak for itself.  I'm a little bummed.. I want to keep this place a secret from the masses, but really everyone should come down here and try what Ma Ma Wok is doing.  There is also a doughnut place next door, so this shopping center has become very dangerous to me.",

    "text": "The food is unreal! It's some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. The menu is as extensive as any Chinese restaurant which is an impressive feat for a vegan restaurant. It's a wonderful thing to be able to destroy a bunch of Chinese food and not feel like trash afterwards.   The general tsos, pork buns, Singapore noodles  and spring rolls are all amazing but try as many items as you can. Ive never been disappointed in anything here.   Also the place is clean and the staff is super nice. Atmosphere for dine-in is pretty standard for a Chinese spot in a strip mall but service and food make up for that. I think everyone should try this place. I'm blown away by this place. I eat here any time I'm in the area",

Will most likely be one of my favorites when I move to the area. I had house mei fun, really good but I just wish it had more veggies. I had a spring roll, hot and sour soup and wonton soup. Loved it all, and I was stuffed afterwards! I haven't had wonton soup since I became a vegetarian 12 years ago. Staff very pleasant and helpful! Offered sample before ordering, general Tso chicken-a lil chewy but flavorful. I won't order that.",

The hot and sour soup was okay; I wouldn't order it again. And the sweet and sour chicken was weird. The meat was hard and had a strange texture. When we cut into it, it was very dark that it almost made us wonder if it was pork. Couldn't have possibly been chicken like we had ordered. I'd like to try them again but not sure I'd get anything else but their lo mein. Reminds me of the chow mein we have so much of in San Francisco.",

We ordered the Kung-Pao chicken (Yes, if you've read my other Chinese restaurant reviews, Kung Pao chicken is clearly my benchmark of quality) with steamed rice and a spring roll.  They prepare their meal in a relatively light sauce, somewhat runny.  It contained the typical vegetables and wasn't anything to shout about.  We did ask for it extra-hot; however, it was nothing more than spicy BBQ potato chips --and nowhere near Andy Capps hot fries.  The restaurant inside was pretty clean, and they were very efficient at making the food in the typical 5 minutes.  If I eat here again, it will only be because the Lotus Cafe down the street is closed due some freak event.",

The place is very well run and obviously cared for by the folks behind it.  It's always clean and things are consistently busy.  They get good food out hot and fresh.  And it's consistently excellent.  We've tried many of the dishes without a disappointment.  Some of the dishes are on par with the best Chinese food I've had (Seattle, San Francisco, Vancouver).  Most are at least on par with any other Chinese place in town.  If you're a snob, this place is not for you.  It's simple, spartan decor is about efficiency not elegance.  If you dine in you might sit between landscapers and lawyers.  And if you do dine in, or carry out, or have your food delivered, don't hesitate to ask for what you want.  They can modify most of their orders with great ease and are happy to do so.  If you are in the Blakeney area do yourself a favor and give Ma Ma a try.",

The shredded beef was large chunks of beef, and had a lot of onions. It tasted like beef with onions. The bean curd was fried too long. The fried dumpling didn't have any taste,and same goes for the hot and sour soup. I had to throw away most of the food. When I sat down for my order I noticed several worn shoes on the floor visible from dining room. I would not go back again.",

With the lack of authentic Asian restaurants in CLT- the Singapore Mei Fun is the closest authentic dish I'm going to get until my next trip home.  I do not recommend the crab wontons, its usually a hit or miss.  Chicken in broccoli in white sauce is another dish I order when the family is not in the mood for noodles.",
