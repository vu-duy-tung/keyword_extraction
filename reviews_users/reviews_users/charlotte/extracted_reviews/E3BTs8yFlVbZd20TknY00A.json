My son had the Turkey sandwich and the bottom bun was so soggy you could have rung it out. My daughters Mac and cheese was so cold it was like they took it out of the refrigerator. We were all very disappointed. I have been here several times and sometimes it's a great experience and other times it's like a 5 year old is running the show.",

I got the 4 meat Mr. Jim's Deluxe combo so I could try a little bit of everything. I chose the brisket, classic pulled pork, baby-back ribs, and the smoked chicken along with mash potatoes and macaroni & cheese for my sides.  The brisket was ok but the ribs were pretty damn good. The pulled pork was up there with the ribs as well. My favorite was the chicken because it was so moist and tender. The mash potatoes were delicious and that gravy is to DIE for! I put that gravy on everything. The macaroni was so rich and cheesy. The best part about eating there were the unlimited cheese breads which is like heaven in your mouth!   I would definitely recommend this to those who are visiting Charlotte, NC!",

    "text": "I should start by prefacing that I'm a stickler about BBQ and BBQ restaurants. I had lunch here today and it was very disappointing, mainly the food. Right off the bat you don't get any sweet smell of meats being smoked outside or inside of the resturant. That's usually a red flag that this might not be the real deal.   So, I check out the lunch menu and it doesn't look pleasing, so I ordered the combo plate off the main menu. Brisket, Turkey breast, baked beans, and coleslaw. Here are the Pros and Cons cons:  Cons: 1.The Brisket--This is my main issue. This along with the turkey breast came on the plate with sauce on it!--cardinal sin. I asked the waitress to include some burnt ends--non existent.  The brisket was served in one big lump, no slices. It had the consistency and taste of a beef roast-not even close to how brisket is suppose to be prepared. On top of that, it tasted like it was boiled and then maybe, maybe smoked for an hour afterward.   2. No hint of any rub being used.  3. Very little smoke flavor.   4. $22 lunch w/tea and small portions.   Pros: 1.Turkey was moist. 2. Sides were decent.  3. Staff has friendly",

My family and I came in after the lunch rush, we were immediately seated. Our server Brandon was attentive. My mom seemed to enjoy her loaded potato with beef. While I got the turkey with Mac n cheese and potato salad. I was pleased with my meal. Shocked not I enjoyed the potato salad. I just randomly picked it not expecting much. It actually taste like how I prepare mine at home. Next time I definitely want to try the beef or the ribs. The biscuits were good too, nice and sweet. Now there's cheese in it. Not sure if they were supposed to be served room temperature as they were not hot or what...I figured with there being cheese it would be hot..anyway in not complaining there were good. So yeah, a great meal and something for everybody. My son who doesn't eat much enjoyed his hamburger, and their fries appear to be fresh cut.",

I ordered, the soup (Brunswick stew) came out, I had maybe four bites and here is the food, I did not even get a chance to taste the food, and the bill was there, what if I wanted something to go or dessert??? She NEVER checked on me until she came to pick up the bill, I needed a box for leftovers, pointed out that she had never checked on me, she said she was watching me????  I am usually a very good tipper but not this time.  Sorry she is so unhappy there, when I said that to her, she said she loved her job???  I guess her job is to practically throw the food on the table and then leave, I told her I thought she had left because of the lack of attentiveness to a customer....",

My mother in law was never asked if she wanted a drink, my father in law didn't receive his soup until food started coming out and our food took forever to come out. I ordered the fried chicken tacos. They came out cold and tasting of cigarettes. A manager kept looking over and I got his attention. He thought he smelled cigarette smoke and that's why he kept looking at me. Literally, the chicken tasted and smelled of cigarettes.   My mother requested to not have onions and mustard on her burger and guests what? The burger came out with everything she didn't want. When my mother brought this to the attention of Jamie our waitress, she was ignored. She had to get the attention of the manager and he took it back and got her a new one. My mother in law requested no pecans in our salad and no surprise here...got pecans in her salad. Another waitress overheard and was willing to take it back. Our waitress stood there and did nothing.   When the cook arrived with my replacement food, he gave a backhanded apology stating the taste wasn't for everyone. I know what smoked food tastes like. No one likes the taste of cigarettes in their food. I requested a medium well burger and received something that was burned on the sides and barely cooked in the middle. The burger just fell apart as I ate it. Same thing happened with my mother's replacement food.  When the check came out, the tacos were still on the ticket! They were trying to charge us for food I didn't eat. The waitress gave a half apology and got it removed. My family and I will never come back here. I suggest everyone else do the same.",

We waited so long for the food and when we finally said something it was delivered immediately. My cheese wasn't even melted on my burger and it was lukewarm, my dad's meal was also cold so much that his sides dishes congealed. They did do the right thing and took care of the meal and also offered us a gift card. Unfortunately The food was awful   . I don't know if it's new management or not but they need to get it together .",

We realized we should've sat on the bar side since the restaurant side was full of screaming kids and felt like a Shoney's/Sonny's, which is fine, but I think we were both thinking it was more comparable to Mac's.  Not so much.  Our waitress was nice but slow and kept complaining about how needy her other tables were and how tired she was.  Have I mentioned I HATE when servers complain to me while they're waiting on me?  'Cause I do.  I have to agree with everyone else about the sweet cheesy biscuits they bring out before the meal; I finally had to put the fella's dirty napkin over the basket to keep from eating every. single. one.    I got the Hickory-Grilled Chicken Breast Plate with baked beans and cinnamon apples, but they were out of apples, so I went with mashed potatoes.  The chicken was juicy and a little too salty; the beans started off sweet and turned spicy (yum); and the mashed potatoes tasted like they were from scratch.    The fella was underwhelmed with their beer selection compared to Mac's, but he went back and forth on whether their pulled pork sandwich beat Mac's.  He wasn't a fan of the sauce coming on the sandwich, but he got over it... and he said J&N's collards beat Mac's hands down.  If we go back, we'll definitely opt for the quieter bar side, and the fella will probably try their bourbon selection instead of their beer.",

It was around 11:40ish when I arrived so my stomach was overly excited.  You can grab a small plate or a combo for less than $10. If you have lunch buddy then you can place two separate orders in their drive-thru. If you have time to eat inside then you will have more options... in which I would suggest a turkey sandwich. Sounds simple but I promise you will be full after devouring your meal (because I know I did).   The servers are always pleasant, so I would highly recommend this place for a quick BBQ fix!",

This is our first visit and not only was our server super friendly and prompt, our food came out quickly and it was great! The first thing they bring are little cheddar biscuits and they're amazing. Be careful cause they go down fast and you'll ruin your appetite. My husband had brisket and said it was good. I had the pulled pork on a potato and it was great! The sauces have a smokey vinegar taste and the hot one has a kick for sure. We will definitely be back to try more items.",

Queso dip is a good starter. Decent selection of beers. But it can be a little pricy for some things. Wife loves mac and cheese.  Service Typically the service here is average. We've never had out of this world service but it's always been enough to get through the evening without any issue. However, our last experience wasn't good at all. We had one round of refills by our waiter (the server who brought the food also gave us a round of refills). We then received the check and I placed my card in the holder with the check and placed it on the end of the table. We waited and waited and waited. After about 20 minutes and a lot of frustration we went to the bar and checked out ourselves. The bartender was very apologetic but our waitress didn't really seem to care all that much. This would be a 1 star and prior times would be 3 stars so I give it a 2.  Overall I gave this place a 3 out of 5 because the food is good and the service is usually acceptable. We will be trying some new BBQ places the next few times however.",

He took our drink orders and left for a good while, then proceeded to have a conversation with his coworkers after I said we were ready to order when he brought our drinks. When he finally came back he seemed so not in the mood to be there. We ordered the Pulled Pork Nachos as an appetizer and it was absolutely horrific. Not only were the nachos cold, but the pulled pork looked like canned cat food. We pushed it to the side and if he was attentive he would have noticed that we left the entire plate untouched. He didn't even bother to ask how was the food. Our ribs were cold & funny tasting and the mac and cheese had a glob of cheese clumped up in it and that was cold too. I learned over the years to never send your food back. We usually take our food home but today we left all of that garbage on the table. All we wanted was a good customer service experience and tasty food like we usually get. WE WILL BE TAKING A VERY LONG BREAK FROM JIM & NICK'S!!!",

They also stopped doing beer and drink specials. The beer I liked, they stop carrying. They also had food \"specials\" yet, they werent any different from what was on the menu nor a price difference. The cheeze biscuts or conrbread, whatever they were, are VERY addictive! We got the brisket and it was very good. Tender and juicy on a nice roll. Mac n Cheese is homemade and good but a VERY small portion. I had a half and half tea/lemonade, decent. Service was speedy. I also had the peanut butter pie for desert, very yummie. Its more of a family place now and certainly not a place to go for drinks. Im not sure why they downsized their menu, but thats not a good sign.",

I love the double-stack sandwich: pulled pork and brisket with a double-bun! The corn bread is so good you'll fill up on it if you're not careful. Great service, great food, you gotta check it out.",

We first tried this place a few months ago and have been back multiple times.  The atmosphere is great, they have their own brand of beer and the food is very good!  The little cornbread cheesy muffins they bring out before your meal are very addicting and before you know it you have gobbled down 3 before your dinner arrives....whoops!  Kitchen Sink Nachoes are my favorite, they are nachoes with queso (liquid cheese for those not in the know, it is a requirement of my husband's for all acceptable nachoes) pulled pork! more shredded cheese, lettuce, jalapenos, and BBQ sauce.  I don't know how you could possibly go wrong!  I've also had the chicken club sandwich, a burger, and pulled pork.  I tend to shy away from large platters of meat so I stick to a sandwich.  The potato salad is great and the collard greens are wonderful as well.  Lots of parking and pretty reasonable prices!",

But, is that really a complaint? I think not.  Highlights: - Peach sangria  - two thumbs up. I split a pitcher with my husband and we were smitten.  - Spare ribs-  best Carolina ribs I've had so far.... I'm still an ultimate fan of St.Louis and Arkansas BBQ, but they were still very moist and fall-off-the-bone tender  - Smoked catfish - I am not the biggest (cooked) fish fan, but this hickory smoked catfish was divine. So much flavor!! A crust, but yet tender and flakey on the inside!!! How do they do it?!   - Smoked wings - my brother in law ordered these, and he is the ultimate wing fan. He said they were an 8 or 9 out of 10, and he knows his stuff!!!!  Don't expect any lean sides, even with the vegetable of the day. When we went and I ordered it (boiled cabbage) it was laden with delicious bacon or pork of some sort. The collards are some of the best I've had, but I wouldn't order them if I was on a diet. But who eats BBQ on a diet??  Bottom line: The best BBQ I've had in this part of the city. You'll face a wait, even on a weeknight, but take out and a drive thru are available as well. Check it out!",

My happy place is the deliciously tender and flavorful Baby Back Ribs and the flakey, mouthwatering Fried Catfish.  My husband prefers the habanero sauce, but I use the regular.    The potato salad is our go-to.   The mac and cheese is so rich and delicious, but we stay away from it now.   Their starter cheese biscuits are like a wonderful desert and the Sweet tea is just right.    Their smoked turkey is also delicious, but we can't seem to pry ourselves from our usual order.    I'm sure the rest is fantastic, but we are creatures of habit.  So far the customer service has been exceptional.  So, 5 stars!",

On my last trip home, I finally decided to give in to my curiosity and gave it a try.  Decent service. Decent food. Nothing to get overly excited about, but nothing to say \"no\" to.   Everyone else seems to be obsessed with the corn bread cheese biscuit things. Usually I'm all about some sinful carby treats, but these were not worth the calories, in my opinion. Get me one of those Red Lobster biscuits and we'll talk.   The BBQ was average -- the kind that you get out of the south and people freak out over...but when you're actually in the Carolinas and you're serving BBQ like this...I'm not impressed.   I will say the Mac-n-Cheese was pretty legit and yummy.   Bottom line, if you're not super duper into finding the best BBQ, this place is perfectly fine. It would be a great place to take a family out for lunch. But if you're looking for something super delicious and special, this ain't it. Keep on looking, kiddies.",

Cost to worth it ratio: 3  Eve award: best cheese biscuits--move over Red Lobster  Highlights: - Cheese biscuits: more like a muffin actually--soft, fluffy, cheesy, with a bit if sweetness and complete with a crunchy outer layer. You need at least a few baskets of this when you're here--the rest is just filler. - Pig salad: not just iceberg but romaine and spinach as well topped with the mother size of all croutons, plenty of shredded cheddar, charred meaty bacon, succulent grape tomatoes, and my favorite clincher: almond slices. You have a choice of meat and beef brisket is always mine. Solid salad. - Beef brisket: my fave is still in Texas, but this is pretty good outside of that. Thick but tender pieces with inherent flavor. Not quite cuttable with just a fork, but close. - Drinks: they have a full bar and impressive beer and wine list. I don't expect great wines at places like this but they touted glasses of honig sauvignon blanc and seghezio zinfandel. Also they make great cocktails with fresh squeezed juices. I had a peach tea which used their lemonade and even though it was on the sweet side, it was great. Big score for a casual spot with great food and drinks! - Atmosphere: Open, comfy, roomy, and woody. Love the booths against the wall. - Service: fast, friendly, and attentive.  Midlight: - Bbq sauce: I like a buffet if options and you get 2 choices here. Regular was tomato based but a bit too light and vinegary for me. I was a bit scared off by the habenero, but I prefered this sauce, as it was a darker mollasses-like color and didn't have an unmanageable kick.  Lowlights: - For some reason I think it tasted better in Charleston where I was completely blown away, but don't get me wrong--it's good stuff.  Excited to have this location relatively c",

So, in saying that, the experience my family had did not match the scores I'm seeing on Yelp.  First, I want to say that this is a good establishment.  Clean, friendly service, delicious freebies.  However, the food portions did not reflect the correct pricing.  I am a big city guy and I have been to many cities as a veteran.  The BIG knock was that my brisket came out dry.  A BBQ place that can't serve juicy - tender brisket is damning in my eyes.  I'm not saying the rest of the food we ate was bad.  It was good.  But, again, does not reflect the good reviews I'm seeing on fellow Yelpers or pricing on par with big city BBQ places.  Sorry, Jim n' Nick.  I hope my next experience revises my review.  I really wanted to like your establishment.",

Upon getting seated and the rest of my party arriving, the wait staff was generous enough to state the specials of the day and some of the favorites on the menu.  One of these best items on the lunch menu was pigs in the garden (salad with pulled pork).  You could actually top the salad with any of their meats...I chose brisket.  It was delicious!  After I left and traveled to my next destination, I had noticed that I had forgotten my credit card at the restaurant.  I called them immediately and they let me know they had located it.  To my relief, they stated that they would just send it to my home free of charge.  Great customer service goes a long way and you'll never feel short of it at Jim'n Nick's bar-b-q.

    "text": "I recently moved to North Carolina, and clearly, this is the place for good bbq. I was told to go to Jim n Nick's for really good food. I ordered the 3 meat combo with spare ribs, pulled pork, and brisket. My two trimmings (sides) were collars greens and potato salad and I ordered a sweet tea to drink. My boyfriend ordered the 2 lb spare rib plate with Mac and cheese and fries with a Dorothy's peach iced tea.   The ribs were smoked perfectly, and fall off the bone tender. Brisket and pulled pork was tender as well and full of smoked flavor. The collard greens were very flavorful, not bland at all, and the potato salad was delicious!! I am very picky about potato salad, by this was absolutely delicious, I just wish they gave you more of it, but I had enough meat. The complimentary biscuits were tasty and hot as well.   I loved the atmosphere and the smell of the wood smoke in the air. When you walk in here, you know you are in a TRUE barbecue joint!!!",

They have really good sauces to compliment the pork, and as mentioned by many, the cheese muffins are great. One of the great benefits of coming here is they have a drive through which you don't see at many GOOD BBQ joints. They are slightly more pricey than some, but I guess that's the price to pay for convenience. I'll be going back.",

That was an excellent first impression!  Being newbies, my friend and I were easily overwhelmed because we didn't know what to order. Our waitress was fantastic! She brought out samples of their most popular dishes and those heavenly little cheese biscuits!   We finally made a decision, I ordered the brisket and pulled pork with mac and cheese (of course) and collards. First, they are not shy with the portion sizes here! Second, the brisket and pulled pork were both so tender and full of flavor! Like slap yo momma....flavorful. (sorry mom) I couldn't decide on which one I liked more. And let's not forget about the sides, both the mac and cheese and collards were delish!  Overall, it was a fantastic meal with really good service....and what more could you ask for?",

I have been to events that they catered but had no idea how great their food on site would be!   My college roommate requested one last Southern meal before he returned up North. Since it had been a whirl wind weekend we went with the close option and had a great meal.   The cheesy biscuits came out warm and were delicious. Hands down the best cheesy biscuits I have had a restaurant. We raved about them in our little group and the waitress was kind enough to bring out another round on the house (not sure if that is standard practice or if she overheard us and decided to be generous).  I ordered the brisket plate with mac & cheese and baked beans. The mac and cheese is super creamy and smothered in a plentiful cheese sauce. The baked beans were mildly spicy and a generous portion. The brisket was a little fatty for my taste but was tender and paired with a great sauce. The surprise star of the meal was the smoked turkey breast that the boyfriend got. Super juicy and delicious.   I will definitely go back soon and may have to roll home after the huge portion sizes!",

I came with a party of four: one person ordered the catfish sandwich, brisket sandwich, and 2 had the BBQ chicken with 2 sides collards and Mac and cheese.  One of the people in our party did not like the brisket, the waiter took away and the manager came over handling the situation perfectly. Apologizing so many times which I hadn't seen in a long time, but you could tell he was truly passionate in the business and wanted all of his customers to enjoy the experience in eating in the restaurant. We assured him we were great. The manager ended up taking the brisket off of the bill and allowing them to order something else at no charge. With that service alone this place will be around for sometime  and I would recommend this place for some gooooddd BBQ.",

They had two servers assigned to our party so ordering went quickly and our drinks came in a very timely fashion. They bring to the tables baskets of freshly made, served hot, cheese biscuits (although they were more like muffins). I didn't care that much for them, but everyone else seemed to like them. Our entrees came out relatively quickly -- orders of ribs, brisket, bbq nachos, pork and various side orders were excellent. Our drinks were continuously refilled and when it came time for the check our servers asked how we'd like them divided and gladly provided six separate checks.

Both the hostess and server were as sweet as the tea, which made up for the bbq that I didn't find particularly impressive. Between all the people at my table we ordered a good portion of the menu, a thumbs up was given to the free cheesy corn muffins, bbq turkey and fried green tomatoes (which aren't actually on the menu). While it was a dollar upgrade the beef brisket left something to be desired as did the creamed spinach and fries. I probably won't be returning to this bbq joint as it has lots of competitors, but as I said it seemed to be a popular place for the locals so maybe the majority should rule.",

    "text": "I moved to Rock Hill from Beaufort, SC in March of this year.  My whole family was excited to see that there was a Jim & Nick's in Charlotte, since this was our favorite resturant back home (there was one about 20 minutes away in Bluffton, SC).    When my now-husband and I got engaged this past June, we called around to several caterers to check pricing for our 50 to 60 guest wedding.  After being shocked by their prices (and their bad attitudes!) I remembered that Jim & Nick's does catering.  I called them and was connected with the owner, who was incredibly nice and helpful.  He gave me a quote on the menu I had chosen and it was more affordable than just getting hors d'oeuvres from one of the cranky catering companies I had spoken with!  I couldn't believe it! The entire staff, especially Katie, who I believe is in charge of the catering services, was exceptional and accomodating in every way possible.  I called Katie several times with changes and additions and she was always more than happy to take care of whatever I was requesting.  On the day of the wedding, the two staff members who where sent to set up, serve and clean up after where punctual, efficient and polite. And, of course, the food was amazing - as usual!  Everyone at the reception was raving about how good it was and those people who had not yet visited the restaurant said they would definitely be going there soon!    Everything about my experience with Jim & Nick's was outstanding, from beginning to end.  I cannot say enough good things about this establishment and I will use their catering services again in the future whenever I have an event that requires it.",

    "text": "Me and a co-worker came here for lunch today to try this place out since it just opened recently.  When we pulled in the parking lot was really crowded, which meant it was pretty packed inside too.  We sat in the bar so we didn't have to wait for a table.  Placed our orders and then our waiter brought us a basket of bread.  We ate those right up and then sat there for about 5 minutes, hoping our food would be coming soon. It still wasn't ready (we both ordered pulled pork sandwiches with one side) so our waiter offered us more bread.  Still waiting, no food, no bread.  Our waiter comes back and says the bread was still baking and that our food was almost ready.  Finally, about 10 minutes later, our bread came, and then about 5 minutes after our food arrived.  They mixed up our orders (I had my sandwich on a bun with mac and cheese, my co-worker had his on sourdough with mashed potatoes.  My sandwich was on the plate with mashed potatoes and his sandwich on mine.)  Anyway, we only had to swap our sandwiches so that wasn't too big of a deal but it was a little annoying especially since we had to wait a little long for what I would imagine wasn't a difficult thing to make.  So, the pork was good but a little dry in parts, I had to add more bbq sauce to each bite so that I wouldn't have to chew so much.  The mac and cheese was a little too creamy for me, not the best.  Our waiter asked if we needed more water once but never did fill it, we had to ask another worker to get it.  I did finish my plate but it wasn't anything I'm dying to go back for!",

    "text": "Since Jim 'N Nick's opened a few years ago, I have eaten there about 4 times. The first 3 visits I enjoyed the food. I usually get the Hickory-grilled Chicken Sandwich. It was always filled with a generous portion of white-meat (as per the menu) on two slices of thick sourdough grilled bread.  The last time I went there, I ordered the chicken quesadilla and the usual chicken sandwich. What a complete 180 degree turnaround in quality! The quesadilla had all dark meat and was skimpy on the portion (not to mention it was tasteless) and the sandwich was horrible. It was a combination of white and dark meat that barely covered the bread. And talk about the bread, it was two slices of thinly-sliced sourdough toast. What little chicken was in the sandwich was falling out because the toast was falling apart.  I never experienced such a turnaround in food quality at a restaurant ever. Some people might say I just went on a bad night, but the complete 180 turn was enough for me to NEVER to go back.",

    "text": "I easily would have given my first visit here (through the drive-thru) an easy 5 stars as the food (6 piece chicken strips w/ Habanero BBQ Sauce on the side) was PHENOMENAL!...however, I had to wait close to 10 minutes to get it.  Now, I must say it was piping-hot, fresh, and damn delicious when it finally came out, but service needs to be in-place to make the experience worth 5 stars.  After ordering, paying, and proceeding to drive up to the second window...I waited 1 minute to have an unfortunately dirty-looking guy tell me (nicely) that it will be a couple minutes before the food comes out.  Okay, no problem, right?  Well, that was the last I saw of him until he handed me the food 8 minutes later with no apology, or any further explanation as to why it took that long when they are clearly trying to offer drive-thru service as a means of getting their incredible food.  Perhaps a sign is needed (Drive-thru) telling potential customers that food may take awhile!  We don't know what's going on in there!  Of course we want fresh and hot food, but don't leave us guessing that our food might be being neglected for whatever reason!  At least put a sign up if the food usually takes 10 minutes through drive-thru!  That was some fine-tasting chicken strips, however!  Huge!  And that habanero BBQ sauce (which I didn't see listed on the menu) is incredible if you like spiciness!  I will go back!",

We ordered pulled pork, brisket and a ribeye steak..we also chose mac n cheese, collards and a wedge salad. The food was good, but the manager's genuine concern about an undercooked steak went above and beyond my expectations. We did not get the typical...sorry let me throw it back on the grill. Without us ever asking to speak to the manager, he took time out of what appeared to be a very busy night, to apologize and express genuine concern for us not having all of our food out at the same time. If I could give more than 5 stars for service they definitely deserve it. My food was good and also earned 5 stars (even with the steak having to be made a 2nd time...it was worth the short wait). I would definitely stop here again, next time I am in the area.",

    "text": "The BBQ Train Stops @ JIM 'N Nick's...  I am not saying I know everything there is to know about BBQ, but I can say I have dined at dozens of BBQ places up and down the east coast, and in my humble opinion, Jim 'N Nick's can stack up to any of them - chain or not!    It starts with that classic, smokey BBQ smell wafting through your nostrils the second you enter the spacious parking lot, and get out of your vehicle.  Upon entering and being seated, a friendly server came right over and took our drinks orders.  Feeling wild and crazy, I decided to go with the Arnold Palmer, instead of my standard sweet tea order when at BBQ restaurants.  I can say that my Palmer was perfect, and not rot-your-teeth-out sweet either.    As for the food - I ordered the half rack of ribs (see pics) with baked beans and mac-n-cheese.  My gf ordered the veggie plate (which was pretty much  an entree with three sides) - she got fries, mac-n-cheese and collard greens (see pics).  After a short wait, we received our food, took our usual pictures for all you Yelpers out there, and dug right in!   My gf and I were both thoroughly impressed.  The ribs were superb - tender, moist, full of smokey flavor, and truly fall-off-the-bone!  There's nothing worse than a restaurant that advertises fall-off-the-bone ribs, and the ribs are stuck together like Siamese twins!  I can give the ribs my full endorsement.    Don't even get me started on the sides - the mac-n-cheese and baked beans.  They were both full of savory goodness, and tasted more like something your grandma would make over Thanksgiving than something served at a chain restaurant.  I mean, there are still many places out there serving up Kraft box, mac-n-cheese, and calling it \"homemade\" - not Jim 'N Nicks.  The baked beans were as good as any I've had in recent memory.  They were seasoned with pulled pork and you could actually see the chunks of pulled pork in the bowl.  Even though I might receive some negative feedback for this, I am gonna go ahead and put it out there anyway - Jim 'N Nicks is as good as any BBQ establishment in the Charlotte area.   Is it the best BBQ I've ever had? No, of course not, but its far from average, and way better than many of the locally owned \"legends\" that sadly  populate the greater Charlotte area.  The next time I think of going to Mac's, I will probably pass, and go check out the new kid on the block -  Jim 'N Nick's!",

Also tipped $5 in the order because I asked for extra sauce, sour cream  and peppers on side. Got home and nothing on the side and absolutely NO double chicken, couldn't even find any chicken!!!  Did have my Son take it back and he came back after waiting 30 min with double chicken but now couldn't find the nacho chips!  Offered no discount or apologize Sad!!!!!  Missing the old manager!!!  Sweet great guy short with long reddish beard!  He always made things right!    Ok! Once again, called in order and WRONG!  Even specified exactly what we wanted. It was BBQ CHICKEN NACHOS AGAIN!  Asked for extra chicken on two orders but asked for the chicken to be put in the side (that way we could see that we were given extra chicken). NOPE! Didn't happen and the nachos were so so dry, no cheese was even on them!  We are done! They used to be so so good! Terrible and not going back again",

We stopped by Jim & Nicks early before the dinner rush and they gave our party one of the large corner booths. Our server was on the ball with water and and some corn bread from the get go. Then taking our drink and dinner orders.   I went with their Classic Style Chopped Pork BBQ sandwich and it was delicious! Along with that I ordered fresh cut fries and baked beans. After doing the initial tasting I added their Spicy BBQ Sauce to the sandwich and wow did that add some POP to it. The fresh cut fries were delicious and the baked beans were infused with BBQ. Just really really good stuff here! The meal was a home run!  I wish I had picked up a bottle of their Spicy sauce and after taking a look at their website I found that you can buy it online. w00t!   Jim & Nicks Sauces: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jimnnicks.com%2Fstore%2Fproduct%2Fgoods%2Fsauce%2F&s=abd9772f242e7c8146eb69e6455dd26732d589dc1a70baa6d4a7fb5cfbe60906\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">jimnnicks.com/store/prod...</a>  All in all an excellent stop for dinner. I can't wait to go again and wish they had a J&N closer to home back here in Norfolk, VA.",

Service has always been slow, it is often ten minutes before our drink orders are taken or been acknowledged. At least say something when you pass the table 20 times.

While sitting next to us was a guy that appeared to be having the time of his life by his self at the bar lol, he told the bartender hey get these two young people whatever they want and put it on my tab well i ordered a margarita, told him thanks he said life is good i said yup amen cheers to that, sipped down my little margarita we told him thanks grabbed our food came home and smashed everything.We will be back!

My recent stop here, I was tempted with the Fri-Sat prime rib special and it turned out to be one of the best I've had! And the staff is always going the extra mile to make the meal superb. Eat here!

Love these little cheese biscuits even though they look like mini muffins. Had the ribs,beef brisket,mashed taters with gravy, Mac and cheese was goooood. Very cheesy and creamy just how I like it and collard greens had a smoky taste to it. Which I also like. The only thing I didn't like was the ribs had an over powering smoky taste to them. I had to rub the BBQ sauce they give you to even it out. But still good. I will be going back and suggest you give it a try.",

The beef brisket is my favorite and their Mac and cheese is amazing. My favorite thing they have is the cheese muffins though, and they're free! We actually bought some of the mix to make them at home and they came out great as well. The plate we usually get is two meats and two sides of your choice for about $22. The portions are so big though, that we always have to get a box and eat an entire meal the next day with the leftovers! We've only ever had one waitress we weren't pleased with there and I haven't seen her there since. The rest of the times we have gone have all been great service. Brandon is our favorite waiter! I would highly recommend this place, as it's our favorite place to eat on this side of NC and SC.",

The mac and cheese was yummy, but the potato salad wasn't that great, though I do have a very specific palate for my grandma's Arkansas recipe, and few places have lived up to it. We had banana pudding, again, with my grandmother's recipe as the gauge for goodness. This pudding was disgusting! And I never leave dessert unfinished! The bananas were brown and slimy, the \"pudding\" had the consistency of gritty, gooey, slime and had a very weird flavor! Finally, the server was lacking in the basic friendliness and warmth that one would expect from a server! He shuffled around and seemed to slam dishes down on the table. It felt like we were intruding on his time. The experience overall was very different from the reviews we read on Yelp. Considering we are only going to be in the area for a very short time we are bummed that we chose this place for our NC bbq experience!",

    "text": "[southern accent]Feller Yelpers,  I had the esteemed pleasure of visiting this joint while on a business trip to the banking (bailed out) capital of the south, Charlotte.  This was a lunch outing with some of my colleagues.  We decided to take a right turn somewhere amid warehouse world (this is how I affectionately called Charlotte's Industrial park at Westinghouse Blvd) ending up at Jim and Nick's.  This looked like a decent enough lunch spot from the outside and the parking lot was packed, this is always a good sign.  I always figure that a restaurant with an empty parking lot is either closed or people had such bad food that they left in a hurry to take care of business, i.e., north brown and south brown.    Walking into the place I was immediately reminded of a generic BBQ spot that is trying too hard to be a sports bar.  It fails miserably at this attempt since the amount of TV's per capita is shameful.  I counted a total of 5 TVs.  They weren't big screens either! Blasphemy.  We were sat in a corner booth and I must say our service was subpar.  The food was brought out on time and it tasted good.  However, considering we were on a rather tight schedule, for this was a lunch break, the server could have been quicker and more attentive.  I think not one of our glasses of water was refilled.  I didn't know Charlotte was located near a desert which explains the reason for the conservation of water experienced at Jim and Nick's.  Although, I think it was related to bad service because if my public school Geography class lessons serve me right, the US is the only country in the world with an advanced civilization and freedom.  Oh, and there are no deserts in the southeast except for foreclosed suburbia.  They served a basket of biscuits (see my photos) that were as greasy as a shell rapid lube attendant's slicked back hair.  Not only were they greasy, they were filled with cheese and had a sweet kick to them.  They weren't bad until I had to have my aorta flushed so that my heart could continue to beat after first bite.    I ordered myself the beef brisket with baked beans and a side of the vegetable of the day (see my photo).  I was trying to be healthy with my veggie choice until I saw that the day's choice was butter with a side of corn on the cob.  I can't believe (no pun intended) how much butter was on it.  I have not seen so much butter in my life since the nationally syndicated Fabio commercials.  I miss them.  There was a reservoir akin to the Hoover Damn one of butter under the corn.  I still enjoyed it though.  I was a bit self conscious of going at it full speed since projectile butter kept being shot at my co workers from where I bit into the corn each time.  After some expletives, I gave up and saved my cholesterol the heart ache, see what I did here?  Overall, go here for some quick grubs during lunch time.  Other than this occasion, I wouldn't go here.  The food is good and the atmosphere is bland.  See y'all.[/southern accent]",

    "text": "Jim N Nick's ... Alabama meats North Carolina. The pork is wood smoked as it is in most BBQ locations. Their plus is that their meat is tender and most time moist if you get a plate. You get a sandwich and all bets are off. Their sauces are a thicker red sauce more like what you'd find in Al, TN and Western, NC. Their Habanero sauce would be my favorite.   I understand they now offer a vinegar North Carolina Style sauce but I've yet to have it. That will be my next review as I prefer the Vinegar sauces.  Sides are awesome here and every Jim N' Nicks Location I've eaten at. My favorite sides are Potato Salas and Baked beans. But I will sometimes get their greens.  Their potato salad is very creamy, very tasty. It is just down right good. Their baked beans are some of the best around, a little sweet but extra good when you throw a little of your pork into them.  I will add that they offer sausage which is pretty good but again a bit sweeter than I'd like; their ribs are most times a pass for me. They are not bad but not outstanding either. When I am in the mood for something other than pork I get their catfish sandwich which is very good.  And if you like Lemonade, this is your place! Theirs is awesome.  This is a chain and you'll find locations across the Southeast; most of the locations in TN and AL. I see they also have a couple of locations in Colorado with more coming that way. They are one of if not the best BBQ Chain I've come across.",

Personally, I think that when you spend over $30.00 for takeout for two people and it's completely bungled by whoever threw this together, they should grab one of those workers who scr*wed it up and have them drive the correct food over.  It's simple logic in my opinion.    The food was the usual mediocre chain restaurant product.  In a nutshell: totally not worth it.",

While the BBQ is not the greatest, it is a very good version...kind of a \"Texas\" style with Brisket, Pork, Sausage, Turkey, etc.  Not a typical Carolina barbecue place with just chopped pork...  First course...the cheesy corn bread muffins...OUTSTANDING!  As another reviewer said, I can eat them all day!  These are fantastic...and now...they will sell you the mix so you can make them at home...  For me, I typically get their barbecue turkey with fries.  Their turkey is smoked and very juicy.  They put a bit of their barbecue sauce on it...and away you go.  Very good turkey.  The fries are hand cut and well fried...another winner.  Wifey typically gets the brisket and really likes it as well.  I have found it to be well prepared and also quite juicy...not dry as many restaurants make it.  Finally, the lemonade (my fav) and sweet tea (wifey's fav)...both are very good and come with some crushed ice that makes them even colder!",

Well the answer is pretty darn good actually. My best friends parents use them for catering all the time and it's always really good. I figure if their catering/takeout is that good they must be even better in person. I plan on checking it out ASAP. So this review is specifically like I said for catering/takeout. Their pulled pork is super yummy. Again it's not on par with some good old fashion NC BBQ, however I think it's better than the other chain place down the road that everyone LOVES. So if you are looking for a quick pick up BBQ and you are down in Rivergate definitely give them a try!",

Of all of the BBQ places in town, this is probably the best one near me.  The menu is pretty diverse, the place is always packed, and the food is consistently good.  On this visit we chose to use the call ahead seating. I would strongly recommend this option if you are visiting on the weekends, as it is not worth 30 minutes or longer to wait.  The hostess was very kind, and we only had to wait 5 minutes for our table.  Our server was very friendly and courteous, but she did seem to be a bit preoccupied as she came to our table with small plates(with bread in hand), but neglected to leave those wonderful cheese biscuits we were anticipating.  We had to ask for those delightful morsels of cheese and bread. ( I have added a picture). This is a very important part of the meal.  On this occasion I had the Double Decker with beef, with Mac and Cheese.  It was surprisingly big, yet I was able to manage to get my mouth around this monstrosity without making a mess. ( I have added a picture)  I would recommend this to any BBQ fan, however we all now that in the south, we are very persnickety about our BBQ. Every opinion will vary, but again, my friends and family know BBQ and they come to me for the good stuff.  NCFoodGuy",

    "text": "I was in town visiting my cousin who lives nearby when she suggested we go to this place. Upon walking in I was greeted by a not-so-nice hostess. I don't think I ever caught her name but she had two nose piercings and long black hair. Some time after seating us, the same hostess I described then picked a fight with a waitress saying \"if she had a problem they could take it outside\" lol. So I said to my cousin \"is this a joke?\" and she said nope, don't think so. We were one of staring at her when the hostess turned around and said \"what are you looking at?\". UNBELIEVABLE. That hostess or whatever she was was extremely rude and unprofessional, and had just a nasty attitude, enough to make my cousin not want to bring anyone in again. Our server however somewhat made up for it. His name was Anthony and he brought our food out quickly and with a smile, he was a great server. I give this place two stars because while my food was excellent, the attitude displayed by whatever her name was, was just terrible.",

I could just go for them alone. We ordered the beef brisket nachos to start with they were delicious, even my picky 3 year old enjoyed them. My main course was the smoked buffalo wings, I love the smoked flavor in every bite. The buffalo flavor is on the mildly spicy side. I also had a side of fries. My Fiance got the fully loaded minus the bacon beef brisket baked potato. He also enjoyed his but had to take a good portion to go since it's extremely filling.  The staff was friendly and attentive.

My 1st tip is if your food is not right please give it back to your waitor or waitress.  It is not fair for you to waste money on food you are not happy about.  I did this to myself and after I left I told myself I will never pay for food again that I am not satisfied with.   So I usually like to eat my lunch early.  My husband and I went as soon as they open, thinking were going to get only the freshest and best food right.  Not.... I got the ribs, baked beans and coleslaw.  The problem was the ribs. My ribs were so tough, I had to cut them off the bone with a knife.  When I got to the first slab and had to fight to get the meat off the bone, that was my first sign to send them back.  I struggled to eat half and just wasted the other half.  I know business like to save money and warm up the left overs, but if I am coming there for Ribs, I want them falling off the bone. I've learned my lesson and i'm going for dinner from now on ,so maybe all the old ribs will be eaten and I'll be guaranteed some fresh ribs.",

They offer lots of side but I went with the macaroni and cheese because of the waiters suggestion. Also had a sweet tea to wash it all down. Overall this place has lots of potential but it's just not there yet. The turkey was juicy and delicious. The brisket tasted like I came from 2 different pieces of meat because some pieces were dry and other weren't. The macaroni taste like an experiment. You know those people that decide they're gonna cook thanksgiving dinner for the first time.... Well that same person made this macaroni!!!!! Finally... The tea! The tea  was made by someone's grandmother. It had just the right amount a diabetes!!!!",

    "text": "This place rocks. I drove by Jim and Nicks maybe 5 times while visiting family before stopping in for some more NC BBQ. Back home (CT), barbecue joints aren't nearly as ubiquitous so I sampled wherever/whenever I could on this vacation. Pulling into the parking lot and seeing smoke pouring out the stacks is a welcome sign. The vibe was awesome here. Somehow j felt at home as me and my family say for dinner. The ambience was laid back and the wait staff was very welcoming. I ordered the pulled chicken and smoked turkey with a side of mac n cheese. I have a habit of swaying my opinion of an establishment's food in general by how good the mac is. I was impressed here. It was great. So good I was back the next day just for a side of it.  The smoked turkey and pulled chicken was also very good. Lean, no fat, tasty, and the sauce complimented it well. No complaints at all. However, I will say that I think their cheese biscuits are overrated. The combination of both sweet and savory (that usually works for me with other things) didn't quite click here. I tried to like it but ended up with the \"meh\" reaction.  Overall this place was great. The prices are right and everyone else that ate with me enjoyed also. Will be back",

They do ribs well, brisket well, and pulled pork well!  I usually get the smoked turkey breast with the montgomery county white sauce.  The turkey is always moist, juicy, and delicious.  The sauce is creamy, slightly vinegary, a little spicy, and peppery.  Love it!     While your waiting for your order, they serve up some of the most incredible cheddar muffins.  Fresh from the oven, and the cheese is gooey in the middle.  Don't eat too many though!  Also, be sure to save room for dessert, the pies here are awesome!  Chocolate pie, peanut butter pie!!    They're really flexible when ordering sides.  I just wish the portion were slightly larger especially for the potato salad.  And they rotate side items daily.  How about fried okra?   Bottom Line - they do bar-b-q very well here!  They mix a lot of regional specialties from Carolina pulled pork, to Texas brisket, to Memphis style ribs, to Kansas City style meats here.  They also mix up some good bar-b-q sauces.  One of my favs!",

I was expecting fall off the bone tenderness.  I sawed the meat off the bones with my steak knife.  The ends of the meat were scorched and too crunchy to eat (some of that was in my husband's pulled pork sandwich too, which had to be removed while eating because they were too hard to eat)  The handcut fries were greasy and just ok.  The best part was the southern green beans; soggy, salty, and cooked with ham.    Wasn't worth the trip.",

They are so good and it comes to you in a little basket hot from the oven and freshly baked. You can't just have one... I dare you!   Although this is not the best BBQ I had, it does stand out from a lot of the ones I have tried. I ordered the \"Double Decker\" sandwich, which comes with pulled pork and beef brisket between buns, and served with one scratch-made trimming (side item) for $9.29. It was a good amount of food so I didn't even finish my fries. I really liked their \"authentic Habanero (spelling is correct!)\" Bar-BQ sauce too, it gave my sandwich quite a kick!  I came with a large group of people and the waitresses took real good care of us the entire meal. I was surprised how quickly they took all of our orders and delivered it us too. On top of that we all had separate checks and they delivered in a timely fashion. We made sure they got tipped a decent amount, especially the one with the awesome sense of humor.   I would say that even though this isn't my favorite BBQ joint, I would come back here again.",

The ambience of this place is really good. It's not too loud, but it's not to quiet to the point where you feel you are in a really nice place and I mean that as a compliment.

I ordered deviled eggs and a pig on a bun with fries. I wasn't offered a choice of sauce (although it is clearly marked on the menu) so I'm not even sure which sauce was on my sandwich. The deviled eggs were tasty. I didn't love the sauce on my sandwich but the meat was very good and moist. I am glad they let the meat shine, because it was truly the best part of the meal (as it should be).  The fries were terrible, they were a dried out shriveled pile on my plate.   The service was lack luster. No one was rude, but definitely not attentive. After waiting several minutes for my check I started timing and it was at least another 10 minutes before I received my check. I was very clearly done eating as I was playing a game on my phone.

So I ordered a pound of brisket and went to town.  The brisket was a bit disappointing and was not as well marbled as I would have hoped.  That made it not as tender and juicy and flavorful as I was hoping.  Maybe I just have a higher standard when it comes to brisket, but I wasn't a huge fan and would not come back for the brisket.  The meat came with little rolls which were really good and I had 4 or 5 of them.  Super addicting.    The Brisket was $19 a pound.  It looked great and was presented well, it just didn't hold up in my opinion.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good and it was my first BBQ meal in NC and I was hoping for more.",

For starters, we got the deviled eggs. Only three halves here but they were very delicious.  Main course, Mrs. chose the rotisserie chicken and she was quite pleased. The collard greens were spicy and sharp. Very good portion here and very nicely cooked.  I had the pulled pork. Also a good portion though a little mushed up with the sauce. I think pulled pork should clearly show the individual pieces of meat, but maybe that's just my taste. The mac & cheese was delicious - a good mix of sauce and noodles with some of the top of the tray too. Yum.  Definitely a solid choice for barbecue, even if it is a chain.",

Their menu offers an extensive selection of barbecued meats, plates, sandwiches and even salads. I had the Greek salad, which has smoked meat. I was a little nervous at first as the smoked meat would make it less like a Greek salad, and while that was the case, I wasn't disappointed with the salad. It was quite delicious with the bbq ranch! The dressing was more like a vinaigrette, but it was VERY good!   My husband had the half chicken and thoroughly enjoyed it! He had the collards and onion rings for sides. Onions rings were crispy fried but not greasy. The collards were ok. They weren't much to write home about, but they were good.  If you go, you MUST get the cheddar biscuits!!!!! They are \"smack your momma\" delicious!!! They sell the mix to make at home. I'm unsure if I can replicate how amazing they were, but I'm excited to find out!",

I easily eat at least 5 every time I come and leave unable to move. They are warm, gooey, fresh out of the oven, and are my favorite complimentary item in the city. It's impossible to resist them.   Moving on to the rest of the food... The barbecue is pretty good, but I wouldn't say it's anything to write home about. My favorite thing to get is the loaded mac and cheese on their lunch menu -- mac and cheese topped with pulled pork. It's a pretty delicious combination. It's not on the dinner menu, but all but one time, my waiter has let me order it anyway when I asked.   The service is usually pretty fast as lunch even if it's crowded. On Friday's at lunch it does get pretty busy.   All in all, this is a solid choice for a meal. It's definitely better than most of what you'll find in the area.",

My friend and I were greeted immediately, and seating in a booth of very generous proportions,- no squeezing in these booths. Service was very friendly, courteous, and fast!  We went traditional, with pulled pork. The cornbread was out of this world,- huge moist and tasty muffin tops, and the muffin stumps were the same. (If you are unfamiliar with muffin tops and stumps, go watch Seinfeld...)  My friend had a loaded baked potato side that was twice the size of any baked potato I've ever seen! The portions of everything were huge!  Every imaginable dish and side you could think of was served there, and they were all great. Prices were reasonable.  If I didn't already live here, this place would be on my must visit list whenever I got to Charlotte.  I'll be back,- again, again, and again! Great place!",

I called up to tell them what had happened and they sent me a gift card in a few days which was more than the amount of the pie to my house.  Ordered again last night and everything was delicious.

Could smell the BBQ and decided to use my waiting time usefully.  I saw that place was packed, so I walked right up to the bar.  Was greeted kindly and quickly by the bartender.  Ordered a Terrapin Rye and began to scroll through the rather large menu for a BBQ joint.  First I saw Taco Tuesdays, which was just a tease, cause it wasn't Tuesday, but that sounded like the deal.  Then I saw it, what they wanted me to see.  The Double Decker.  From the bottom-Bun/pulledpork/bun/brisket/coleslaw/bun with a side of your choice.  Had to go with the onion rings too, for another 2 bucks.  $12.99 for a BBQ sandwich with O-rings at lunch, this better be good.  I sat, drank my beer, watched some tube, and read over the rest of my menu.  A catfish BLT?  Gotta try that sometime.  An array of reasonably priced burgers and chicken sandwiches.  Some time past, never saw my awesome bartender again.  Finally got me some cheese biscuits, pretty tasty.  Finally a lady walked up with my food.  It was a great concept and the BBQ was good, but the sauce wasn't quite there.  The backup sauce was labeled habanero, the heat was good but the flavor was barely above average.  O-rings were pretty spot on, but the batter didn't seem to stay on, and they gave the smallest portion of ketchup ever.  My beer was great, but I knew that when I ordered it.  All and all, pretty damn good BBQ(hence the 4 stars), but not worth the price.  And the service was mediocre at best.  If I'm ever down that way again, I'll stop back through.  Hopefully it will be on a Tuesday.  BTW:Uploading a pretty good lookin pic.",

We've eaten here several times and have enjoyed Karl's fried catfish, some yummy mac & cheese (my wife is a connoisseur of the stuff and she really likes it), I like their baked beans (not too sweet) and collard greens (they are well seasoned). The beer selection is adequate and there's a 22 oz. option on drafts... fun! ;)  But today I discovered a special combination: I tried the hot links for the first time (I had heard good things about them. Getting the $5 small plate for lunch (which is one link served with pimiento cheese and saltines) and eye balling the basket of gratuitous cheddar muffins, I had a classic eureka moment: ditch the saltines - cut the muffins in half and make little openface sliders. The results of this dabbling were great!  My belly is so full and happy. $5!!!",

    "text": "I'll change this to 5 stars if my second visit is as good as my first.  Those cheesey biscuits all these reviewers talk about are just as good as they say.  I tried the 1/4 chicken plate and it came with both their original and the white sauce.  I loved them both.  The mac and cheese was good enough to go for just that.  I think it is a pretty good value at just $10 for 1/4 chicken, two sides and those biscuits.  I also had a really nice server.  Often times when a single dinner goes to a restaurant at dinner time they are neglected but my waitress was a kind and attentive as could be. When I couldn't finish the whole meal and asked for a box to take the rest home she even offered me a class of ice water to go.  (disclosure I almost always have just water with my meals because I'm always watching my calories....)  I'll be back for sure and hopefully the experience will be as good as this time.",

Cornbread muffins certainly aren't amazing but they're pleasantly edible. Service is rather slow but they *are* packed and since we got the last table, I'll assume we're the last of a big rush.  Peach tea was wonderful and the chopped peaches in the bottom were actually fresh! Wish the straw was bigger or it came with a spoon - or a bubble-tea straw.  We were offered more bread and said yes.  We got the Queso, Smoked Tomatoes, Nachos appetizer. Fail. \"Smoked tomatoes\" = salsa with liquid smoke dumped in it. Some of the nachos were so stale they ripped instead of breaking.  Our food came and we asked for the bread again.  The beans were excellent. The \"Carolina BBQ\" was barely edible, it was drowned in liquid smoke. BTW, If you know your BBQ, you're offended by the fact they call it Carolina BBQ instead of east coast. (It's vinegar based. Or is it liquid smoke based...?)  She came to clear our appetizer plate and we asked for the bread again. (Oops, I forgot to ask for a refill.)  I liked the mashed potatoes but my wife said they lacked flavor - they're lumpy and fluffy with skins.   She came out and asked if we wanted more tea - our glasses were empty. We'd given up on the bread but she said she just remembered it and would bring it...  The bread finally came.  We finished up eating.  The refills came and we asked for our check. 15 minutes later: 13% tip. Won't be back.",

(Okay, I'm not antisocial at all, just had a moment) the person who took my order was very pleasant and spoke clearly, I appreciate that! I ordered the pulled pork plate with Mac and cheese and a side salad in addition to a sweet tea and 2 cheese biscuits. I was shocked when it came to $19. But of course was willing to pay since I ordered all I did and this was the first time there. Pulled to the window, the young lady working was very pleasant. I got my food quickly and headed home. The sweet tea was perfect! The bbq was good. Now the Mac and cheese was lacking something. Couldn't place my finger on what it was lacking. The side salad was good too, my only complaint was I asked the person when I ordered if the salad came with bacon because I don't eat bacon, she said no but when I got home there was bacon bits. Not a big deal, just had to pick them out. The cheese biscuits were awesome! Overall, I think the price is a little steep compared to other bbq places but didn't feel buyers remorse after. So that's a plus. I'll more than likely return and experience the inside vs. the drive thru.",

Everything was packaged nicely and ready when I arrived 30 minutes after my call. I did have to mention I also ordered drinks but the person working the bar was very nice and quick once she came up. I had a pulled pork sandwich with fries, onion rings and a lemonade. Last minute, I added a lemon chiffon pie to my order. $24 w/ tip. The sandwich was delicious, next time I'll skip the fries and just order the onion rings. The onion rings were perfect even cold! The right amount of onion to breading ratio. If you take away anything from my review - get the pie!! I am a jerk about fake whipped cream and pancake syrup instead of the real deal. This lemon curd was so good you could taste the lemon and egg yolks and the whipped cream on top was fresh. I would go through the drive thru at Jim N Nicks just for this pie.",

Also at our table we had BBQ sandwich, kitchen sink nachos and a two meat platter with brisket and some kind of sausage.  Everyone seemed pleased with their meals (after sending the nachos back to get them without the half head of lettuce that was undesired) and our service was good and our glasses were usually full...overall a good visit and I'd go back and try some of the other things I saw on the menu!

Tried the pimento cheese and hot link app.  Interesting.  It came with sliced Serrano peppers and saltines; presentation unimpressive.  Taste? Wow.  The balance of the slice of the rich link sausage and the blandness of the saltine with a smear of pimento cheese needed the oomph of the pepper.  I had the mac and cheese with the Tuesday taco special.  Portion was generous, pasta not overcooked and plenty cheesy. It was served hot enough to blow while you're eating.  Important because it was difficult to stop eating.  I was getting pretty full before I tried my tacos because of our app and those cheddar, corn, muffin?/biscuits.  They were inhaled pretty quickly.  It's my fault my fish taco got a little soggy.  I had to finish the mac and cheese.  Had to.  It was still crispy but the bottom had gotten a little soggy from the slaw after sitting a minute. The fish was well seasoned and crispy.  The other taco: brisket was less impressive. It tasted slightly smokey but the texture was unexpectedly strange.  On the mushy side.  Service overall was attentive.  Atmosphere and energy level very good.  A good place to get quality food and good service.",

In the meantime, the biscuits were plentiful to the point that I had to take a small box of them home because they kept bringing them even after we got our entrees. The food itself was good and arrived promptly -- in particular, an off-menu sweet potato casserole was only available by circumstance but was entirely delectable. It seems odd they pulled it from the menu, but I hope it makes an eventual return.",

What really made this place 4 stars in my book was the pie.  It is delicious.  You really can't beat a well made coconut cream pie or chocolate pie, and J'nN's really delivers.  Time for a nap!",

    "text": "Opened in June 2008, Jim 'N Nicks BAR-B-Q, in Charlotte's Steele Creek area, is not your typical Bar-B-Q restaurant.  It's simply a great restaurant that happens to serve barbeque.  You step out of your car and are enveloped in the signature aroma of meats roasting slowly over hickory wood-stoked fires.   The brick building is airy and welcoming.  The front porch strung with colored lights is reminiscent of good old days when rocking on the porch with friends and sipping mint juleps on warm summer evenings was not considered indulgent.   Once inside, worries will melt away as you are warmly welcomed into the home-away-from-home of owners Jenne and Troy Taylor.  Immediately, you notice the slower pace and less frenetic atmosphere making the good old days ever more appealing.   The taste nirvana begins with a friendly server appearing at the tableside with a smile and a basket of steaming hot cheese biscuits which, to the taste buds, seem almost surreal.  To whet the whistle you have a choice of traditional beverages such as sweet tea and sodas; but the Jim 'N Nick's experience is not complete without Dave's fresh-squeezed lemonade or a pint of Mudbone, their exclusively small-batch brewed, handcrafted beer.   Made from all natural ingredients, Crystal hops, and three distinct types of malted barley, Mudbone distinguishes itself from the rest of the pack with a well balanced flavor, smooth body, and crisp finish.  Signature cocktails, such as The Picnicker South Georgia Peach Tea, The Glass 'o Sunshine Margarita, or my personal favorite, The Politic'er County Seat Cosmo will get anyone feeling festive.  The drinks and corn muffins seemed to disappear as quickly as the server could replenish them.  Main dishes include the Full Rack of Hickory Smoked Ribs where meat falls off the bone, Beef Brisket that dances on your taste buds, and a Pulled Pork Sandwich on Sourdough served with a scrumptious side of hand-breaded Onion Rings.  The Bar-B-Q Chicken delicately basted with their classic barbeque sauce is delicious, and serious carnivores will love the succulent Two Meat Combo plate.  Side dishes, called 'trimmings', include Bar-B-Q Baked beans, Creamy Cole Slaw, Mac-the-Cheese, Mashed Potatoes, Big E's Collards, and Fresh Cut Fries, to name a few. You can be sure to hit a winner, no matter what entree and trimmings you choose.  Everything at Jim 'N Nick's Bar-B-Q is made fresh daily; I've heard they don't even own a freezer!    They meticulously smoke meats slowly overnight through to early morning adding more meat two to three times a day.  They say their motto is, 'low and slow'.  Nothing is cooked the day before or reheated via steaming.  They make their own salad dressings, croutons, and pie shells in-house daily just like grandma.   Once the food was ordered, we sat back supping our drinks and enjoying the warm woods, soft leathers, and exposed brick creating the comfortable, smart-casual atmosphere.  High ceilings allow fans to circulate air rich with mouthwatering aromas from the open kitchen.   Mouthwatering ribs, chicken with their famous Bar-b-q sauce crafted from white vinegar and a little tomato, and a perfectly cooked rib-eye steak from the specials menu, were delivered to our table quickly.  The three-cheese macaroni was a huge hit, and we fought over who got to lick the bowl clean!  We also enjoyed the creamy coleslaw and bar-b-q baked beans.  If the generous portions prove daunting they are more than happy to box up leftovers to enjoy later.   Save room for dessert, as Jim 'N Nick's homemade cream pies are \"to die for.\"  I ordered the Chocolate Cream Pie and my husband had the Banana Cream Pie - his all time favorite!  They also had Pecan and Coconut Cream Pies on the menu that night.  Their pies are made fresh daily and you can't leave without trying one--what a great way to top off an incredible meal.  Owners Troy and Jenne Taylor stopped by our table to ask how everything was.  They are very hands on, even after the arrival of their new baby boy, and can often be seen chatting with customers throughout the day and evening.   They are great people, so be sure to say hello if they are around.    Jim 'N Nick's BAR-B-Q offers a takeout menu, so you can order ahead and use the drive through to pick up your food.  They also provide catered food, so be sure to contact Karen Mikkelson at the restaurant.  Parties can book the large banquet room, or Jim 'N Nick's will cater your next corporate event or private function at your place.  Everyone loves Bar-B-Q!",

    "text": "Yes I've had better. Here in NC. Even at BBQ joints in the strip mall. Its my second time dining here. The first wasn't very good at all and here we are three months later for our second shot. And just like last time I left most of my food on the plate, no Togo box needed. Tonight I tried the three meat combo with two sides. Classic pulled pork, smoked chicken and smoked turkey. Mac n cheese and coleslaw for the sides. I liked the Mac n cheese. The rest I did not like. At all. The meats were cold. The pork was bland with a lil too much fat. And I'll eat fat if it's tasty. The chicken had something off about the texture. It was dry as was the turkey. Both white meat. The coleslaw has too much pepper and not enough creme. The house BBQ sauce I did not care for. Too spicy but without the sweetness that spicy sauce should have.   Now being a northerner I can see where you'd dismiss my review as he don't know no better. But I do. I like Hillbilly's off 85 in McFadden and I like Lakeview BBQ in the strip mall on highway 16 in Denver NC. I know good BBQ. I can't say it was here at Jim n nicks.   Shame too cuz the layout n decor here is great. My server tonight was 4 stars as was his manager. They even took my meal off the bill when they saw how much I was leaving on the plate. But I gotta review the food honestly. Right?",

It was hard to ask him about them too, because he was never able to be found.  I ordered the brisket sandwich with mac and chz, it was delicious. The mac and chz is so good, so creamy, so bad for your health ha, but I definitely recommend it.  My boyfriend ordered a burger and it was the saddest looking burger ever. I get it, it's a bbq place, but for some reason he really wanted a burger.  His burger looked more like a sausage patty than anything else. I'm not sure if it's the norm, but don't get a burger there, go to Cookout or McDonald's.  Like I said, the waiter was never to be found, not attentive, so we were unable to ask him about the portion size of the burger. That also means you never get a refill on your drink.  He comes right at the end and he asks if we need anything, I ask for a box. He comes back with the check and asks if I need a box, I say yes, I asked for one earlier.   I don't feel it was too busy on a friday night, there was no reason the service was so poor because there were many employees working.  I'd recommend getting carryout if you want the food but don't waste your time with the service.",

Whenever she'd pass us she didn't even look our way. Other ppl were getting their cheddar biscuits before us, multiple times. We had to wait 40 minutes for a freaking salad. A SALAD. Not cool. We were the only black ppl in her section. Maybe that had something to do with it? And to top it all off, she left us with a waitress without even telling us. She had to leave for another job.

I mean our waiter was very friendly, but it took forever to get anything if it didn't get forgotten. The 2nd time was for lunch when they weren't quite as busy but it was still super slow. Finally, I made a pick up order which is probably what I will do from now on. I could tell while waiting for my food this time that the whole place is just not run efficiently. There was a lady on the phone at the bar, in my way of picking up, making phone calls about catering. She had her binders and paperwork all over the bar, along with her salad, spilling over into the space of the patron beside her. Do they not have an office to conduct such business?   The bottom line is that the meat, specifically the brisket, is phenomenal, so I will bear the service. The cheese biscuits are beyond delicious and they sides are nothing to write home about. So just order a pound of brisket or bbq or whatever meats, a dozen cheese biscuits, and make some sides at home. The riblet appetizer was also great.",

    "text": "I'm new to the Charlotte area and this place is my first review as a resident of this wonderful city.  My husband and I decided to patronize this neighborhood spot after searching yelp, of course.  We were promptly seated and had a wonderful and very attentive waitress who genuinely seemed to enjoy her job.  While my husband went to the restroom, I ordered our appetizers and some ice water and they were delivered to our table in a timely manner. We had the nachos topped with beef brisket and the hot, smoked buffalo wings with a side of bleu cheese dressing.  I was a bit leery because the nachos looked like there was hardly any brisket but I was pleased to find that it was just buried under a bunch of lettuce!  They were very delicious and I would order them again. I had to ask for additional jalapenos because there was just a few very small slices on it and next time I would ask for more than just a drizzle of the sour cream.  But like I said, they were delicious.  The wings were piping hot and after a few minutes of cooling they were perfect. Nicely seasoned with a hint of smoke.  Main course was the 2 meat combo and we got it with baby back ribs, sausage, collards and mac and cheese.  Mmmm,, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm finger licking good.  Hubby who isn't a mac and cheese fan really like their version of it and the greens, after adding a dash of tabasco, were quite good.  Ribs, devoured. Sausage with the side of pimento cheese was nice. I wish it was  a bit more spicy but give me a hot dog bun and I could do some great culinary things with it.  And the cheddar biscuits, how could I forget to mention them first.  They came out while we were waiting for our apps and they were the bomb dot com.  I'm so glad I didn't have any butter to add to this gluttony session.  We ended up with 12 of them! Yes, 12!!  And we just had to bring a few home to the kiddos to experience.  So light and fluffy!  The sauces on the table are really good on any of the meats.  They have a drive through if you don't feel like eating in. Yes, I said a drive thru!!  Incredible!  They have TV's to watch the game too.  So, really you have no reason not to give this place a try.  We left happy, full and looking forward to the next visit, and with tax, this great meal only cost us 39 bucks and change!  What a great welcome to Charlotte and my new hood!",

Hubby had the baby backs and said they were really good (and a comment of that sort from him is extremely rare for anything not prepared in my kitchen).  He wanted brisket but they were out.    My daughter (11 yrs) had the kids slider plate, we thought it came with two but it was only one and we ended up having to order a second slider for her because she wasn't full and she thought they were very yummy.  She had a side of Mac and cheese but didn't like it, we swapped it out for fries which were fresh cut and well seasoned and went well with the homemade ranch they have :)  My son had the kids drummies plate and I made them mild vs plain and they had a bit more kick than he was accustomed to but he still ate them because they were also yummy.  Lemonade was yummy and so was the sweet tea.  We all could do without the cheese rolls... A bit too sweet for our liking...  We will definitely be back!!",

Their smoke treatment is top notch, and they are more inventive than I gave them a chance for previosuly.  I have now had the pulled pork nachos.. A MUST HAVE!!   These are so good.  Such a surprise that the pork and sauce, with the cheese and jalapenos go so well together.  The staff is always friendly.   Glad I am taking a minute to update to a better way of thinking !!",

The longest I had to wait was about 10 minutes and it was PACKED. Servers were all over the place and even the manager and hostess were waiting tables, and even the place being crazy busy. Service was amazing, we didn't have to wait long for our food and the servers were always on top of everything.  I took my in laws to this place when they were in town and they absolutely LOVED it. They live in another country, and they're always saying next time they come back the first place they want to come visit is this place. My father in law has a very special palate, and the restaurant accommodated to his requests.   Also they carry the white zombie Catawba beer, and that's the only beer I absolutely can drink until I pass out. The ribs are to die for, the Cuban sandwich is mouth watering, all the trimmings are delicious but the best ones are the buffalo fries, Mac and cheese and the baked beans. Banana pudding for desert please  I've been to this place multiple times, and not a single time hey have let me down. I absolutely and totally loved it. I think this place would LITERALLY kill all the other BBQ places in the city if they had a more centric location. This is by far the best BBQ place in the entire Charlotte metro area.",

I mean, come on...where can you find Peach Sweet Tea? That's virtually unheard of unless you're drinking it out of a can.   We ordered the nachos and I ate off other people's plate because, well I was already stuffed when coming here. I still got a taste of what flavors Jim 'N Nick's was offering. What I found was that it wasn't bad at all. It was tasty and tender.   Overall verdict, definitely a place to try out. Especially if you feel more safe as far as going to a chain. Next time I will be sure to order more and definitely get a Peach Sweet Tea to go!",

    "text": "This review is a little overdue by a month or so.  Anyways, I'm not exactly sure what all the hype is about here.  I would say Jim N Nick's is pretty good had I not had other places to compare it to, but it is just in between 2-3 stars for me.  We came here on a Saturday afternoon with not many people there, so the service was great.  However, we had called to see if they would have a certain game on and we were told yes.  Once we got there and started to order, we asked for the channel to be changed to the game we wanted to see.  They did not get it...so much for that.  The food is just okay, we got a platter with classic barbeque and ribs.  Both were okay, nothing special.  We also got it with a side of mac and cheese and bbq chips.  I am a huge mac and cheese lover, but these just did not do it for me.  I loved the creamy consistency, but the choice of cheese and flavor of cheese was just not right.  The bbq chips were also nothing special, just like your standard bbq chips.  I will say I did like the complementary cheese biscuits.  I could see us coming back here once in a blue moon if we are craving bbq and want something close, but really, the best place to go in Charlotte is Midwood Smokehouse.  Not exactly convenient or close, but it is well worth the drive to that one over Jim N Nicks and others for good quality bbq.",

I was a little disappointed with the baby back ribs it was on the dry side and lacked some serious flavor so I'll just stick with the regular ribs!

    "text": "This will be a very long review but please take the time to read it because Jim 'N Nicks have earned customers for life.  The week before our small wedding was chaos. LOST dresses, I broke a toe, sickness, the venue had an emergency and we needed to relocate 24 hours before the event which caused catering hiccups. To say it was stressful is an understatement we needed to find food for 28 people. I called several restaurants in Charlotte to either be quoted gouged prices or to be told it is the weekend before Christmas and we are too booked to help. So I thought about what our family loves to eat and I took a chance and called Jim 'N Nicks.  I left a message for Catering and explained the chaos of the week and that we simply wanted to feed our guests. I even said if I can't do catering we will order plates to go for everyone. I was thrilled when I was called back by Katie and told it wasn't a problem. I placed our order and was looking forward to picking it up the next day. I had several other stressful things to figure out and felt relieved that was done.  An hour later Katie called back and said that with the stress and chaos we had that week that they wanted to help our trip to the aisle be less stressful. When we would go pick up the food it was on the house that Jim 'N Nicks would be covering the order for our family. I was in shock because the only thing going right was my husband and I would do whatever was necessary to celebrate our love with our family and friends. I told her Thank you but we were not expecting that and her response that she couldn't believe how calm we were about it made them want to do something kind to help change things for us. She wished us a lifetime of love and happiness and assured us that our order would be waiting for us at the arranged time.  Our family and friends loved the food. They devoured it going back for seconds and complimented us on how laid back but amazing the food was. It was authentic to our family and ended up being the best thing to go wrong.   Thank you Jim 'N Nicks for going above and beyond what anyone would ever imagine. Thank you for making our day less stressful and delicious! You have earned customers for life!",

That said, the food is excellent- every time. The service is lively and entertaining (I always sit at the bar with friends), expedient and proactive. Love the BBQ, the smoked chicken (excellent on a salad), fried catfish (don't recommend the grilled), stuffed potatoes and of course the delicious warm cheese muffins they give you as soon as you get there. Decent beer selection, enviable bourbon/whiskey selection. Bar is too small and it's loud like a BBQ place should be. Patio is nice in the spring and fall.   Now I'm hungry, may have to visit the drive through (oh yeah, they have a window... Did your waist just find it too convenient to grow? . Good stuff.",

    "text": "When dining out, my husband and I always enjoy a glass of wine while waiting for our meal.  I ordered a glass of wine, which came with a glass and a carafe of wine.  Our server poored the wine from the carafe into a dirty glass.  The glass had water marks and smudges and looked disgusting, nothing I wanted to drink out of.  We were seated close to the bar, so my husband took the glass of wine to the bartender and asked for a clean glass.  She poured a new glass of wine, which was better than dumping wine from a dirty glass into a clean one, as some restaruants do; however, she didn't check/nor did she wash a new glass.  The glass of wine she gave us was a tad bit cleaner than what I had originally.  I drank my wine from the straw that was provided for my water.    Please, all businesses, the wine glasses need attention!  If/when your bartenders have some free time - have them rewash, reclean, whatever they need to do.  Keep your barglasses clean!  Please!    After that disappointment, my entree was served with a nice 6 inch black hair underneath my chicken.  It was not my server, as her hair was blond and was wrapped tightly in a bun on top of her head, nor was it ours as my husband and I are both blondes.  So, needless to say we won't be going back.",

    "text": "My search for the best barbecue places in the Charlotte area continued recently with a visit to Jim 'n Nick's Bar-B-Q in Charlotte, NC.  Jim 'n Nick's has 28 locations in 7 different states and prides itself in cooking its 'que low and slow and making everything from scratch.  I've heard good things regarding Jim 'n Nick's, so I decided to give it a shot.  I confess that I got excited when I parked and saw a nice sized wood pile on one side of the building and a pull-behind smoker on the other side.  Once inside, I place my order.  The server was a touch slow to come over and take my order, especially considering that the restaurant was not busy at all.  I decided on a combination platter with spare ribs, hot links, pulled pork, and chicken.  For my sides, I picked BBQ baked beans and onion rings.  I chose the hot links as one of the meats since they were featured by the restaurant at the Big Apple BBQ Block Party.  I was a little surprised when they brought out cheese biscuits instead of hush puppies to go along with the meal.  However, the biscuits were very tasty.  After a little while, my plate comes out of the kitchen.  Wow, that's a lot of food!  Before digging in, I saw there were 2 different sauces available on the table.  Why yes, I do think I'll try them out.  The original BBQ sauce has a little lighter color than ketchup.  A naked taste tells me that it's not overly sweet and a little bit bold.  The other sauce is the hot habanero sauce.  There is more molasses present in this sauce.  It is a bit sweeter than the original sauce, and it has a good amount of heat.  On to the food...  all of the meats came out pre-sauced.  I usually prefer that it not be sauced, but this is just a personal preference.  The pulled pork was very moist and flavorful.  The sauce worked well with the pork.  However, I could not detect any hints of the meat being smoked.  The chicken was also very tender and moist.  The cut I was given was a bit unusual -- I was given a breast and wing rather than a leg quarter.  Not quite bite-thru skin, but that's okay.  It was still flavorful.  Now on to the hot links...  I could instantly see why they were the featured item.  The sausage was extremely tasty.  Perfectly cooked and just the right amount of heat...  that made for a tasty treat!  The disappointment for me was the ribs.  I could see that they were smoked.  However, they were dry and overdone.  And now to the sides: the BBQ baked beans were adequate.  They contained bits and pieces of pork shoulder.  I would have liked for them to be a little bit more bold.  The onion rings, on the other hand...  WOW!  Those were some fine onion rings.  I could've made a meal on them, mainly because they were so many.  They were very crispy and very large.  Overall, I confess to being a little let down with Jim 'n Nick's Bar-B-Q in Charlotte.  Maybe it's one of those places where the food is much better for dinner than for lunch, and maybe other locations are just better.  Again, some items were excellent (the hot links, for example), but I guess I just had higher expectations -- especially with the ribs.

The meat seemed to be defrosted and heated up.  Typically you should have a choice of sauce at a BBQ joint but the waiter brought the food dressed in sauce to cover up how nasty the meat looked on my plate.  The MacNChs was OK, the biscuits were decent and my nephew's cheeseburger seemed to have been sitting under a light for hours or maybe even defrosted and heated up.  NONE of our meat was fresh!  Ew.",

    "text": "First off, I must note that this is a chain restaurant based out of Alabama.  If you're looking for a real local Carolina BBQ joint, this is not the place you want to look.  That said, they do have good food and the service is generally good as well.  If we didn't live so close to this place we would not go out of our way to get there.  If your goal is to get some good Carolina BBQ and you know your Carolina BBQ, go elsewhere.  But if you aren't turned off by the fact that it's a chain then it's worth a try.",

    "text": "I have had a lot of bad BBQ. This was not bad, but it wasn't great either.   I had the \"pick 4\" sampler. The ribs were a bit tough and not as juicy as I would have expected. They had decent smokey flavor and the BBQ sauces were good but altogether they were average. The brisket was unremarkable, pretty much what you get most chain type places. The pulled pork was better than average but not by much. Of all the meats I tried the sausage was the best in comparison to what I have had elsewhere. It had good flavor and just the right amount of heat.  As for the sides... The mac and cheese was just ok, I wasn't impressed by the beans, the grilled corn was alright but nothing special. The highlight was actually the corn bread. The bread is made into little corn bread muffins which were absolutely excellent.  I should say that the service was excellent and helped to make the overall experience A-OK instead of just ok.  Overall I would say it is a typical family friendly chain that might serve the purpose if you are hungry but is not a must visit when in the area.",

Last night was the last night we are going to Jim 'N Nicks.  The sandwiches have shrunk, the mac n cheese (which use to be delicious) was horrible.

    "text": "A tale of two issues. Good food, surprising (in a bad way) service Went there tonight with my 12 year old son. I ordered the ribeye, he ordered the ribs. I could tell from the first bite, he didn't really like his; there were lots of little pieces of bone (which will happen sometimes), but also he didn't really like the taste.  I tried to encourage him to tell the waitress, but he doesn't like \"making a fuss\". About 2/3 of the way through the meal, the waitress came to see how everything was, and i told her \"my ribeye is great, but he really doesn't care for the ribs actually\" (and gestured to his plate which was barely touched). She looked, and looked at him, and said \"oh, that's too bad\" and left.  Note: other than this, she was great; very attentive, refilled drinks, etc.  But this is the moment where the staff can either get customers coming back or.... not coming back. And she clearly decided she didn't care.  I quickly finished my ribeye (which was really very good), and she brought the check, we paid, left, and that's that. Probably won't be back. She had every opportunity to suggest bringing him a different entree, or even just crediting back the price of his entree (I was more interested in him enjoying his meal since he picked the place; than in getting my money back) - but she didn't give it a second thought.  I would guess the General Manager would have liked to know since most good restaurant managers know this is the moment where you retain or lose customers, but i really wasn't in the mood to be the one to proactively ask for the manager and spend more time there. We were ready to leave.  So - good food for the most part (appetizer biscuits are good too), but unfortunately they probably lost a customer because a waitress wasn't in the mood to solve a problem.",

I would come here and just eat the beans.  Wholly mother of god they are good.  I had a pulled pork sandwich that was good.  It lacked spice but I fixed that right up with their habanero bbq sauce.  That sauce was so damn good I just wanted to put the bottle in my purse.  Then I realized I couldn't take it on the plane... so I held back.  We had six people (well, 5 and a bebe), and the bill was only $80.  Not bad.  Service was awesome.  Just don't serve me that sweet tea when I order tea, OK?!  If I don't use words like, \"y'all\" when I order, then understand that we west coasters don't get down with that sugar water.  Blehhhhhhchh.  When I put a little of the habanero sauce in my beans it's like, OMG, this might just be the best thing eva. EVAHHHHHHHH",
