The prices aren't the worst--$9.19 after tax for 12 pieces of spicy salmon--but the last working the register wasn't terribly friendly and had a bit of an attitude. That's the main reason I am rating this place two stars.",

The food was a little slow to come out, but the server made it up to us by giving us a free miso soup and edamame. We got a CLT roll. It was great if you like spicy! Pokini was great too! The fish was extremely fresh. I'd highly recommend this place, if you're ever in the Charlotte airport.",

They wanted 13 bucks for shrimp and 6.79 for a beer. It really wasn't even edible. So disgusting. Waitress was nice but I would never go back.",

We saw the sushi bar and decided to give it a try.  I ordered 2 Kirin drafts and they were $7.50 each!  My wife had two glasses of Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio at $9.50 a clip.  I realize it's an airport but geez.  Anyhow, we ordered the Sky Captain Sashimi, the CLT roll, and the Queen CLT.  All were excellent.  The Queen CLT features a light tempura batter.  The CLT was different than most rolls we've ever had.  My wife doesn't eat sashimi so I had the Sky Captain by myself.  It was great and the jalapenos are a nice touch.  Overall, very good.  Too pricey, but good.  Service can be a little slow but sushi takes time and they seem to do a brisk business.",

There's no reason why, if I'm the only person there, that I can't just have the batch he's making, before they refrigerate it into stiff cold rice.

    "text": "Four stars huh? Well yeah...this place deserves it today. I had a couple rolls they make called the CLT roll and the Captain's Roll which were very tasty indeed. I happen to like spicy...both of these rolls have a common spice in using jalapeno peppers either sliced or diced. In addition, the tuna in both dishes was of good flavor and texture. I should clarify that the Captains Roll wasn't really a roll...it was more of a sashimi with yellowtail tuna in ponzu sauce, with sliced jalapenos on top.  Either way, it was exactly what I was looking for in a lunch. Consider this fact as well that this is a sushi place, IN AN AIRPORT, IN NORTH CAROLINA...not what you are expecting to find down this way.  Prices were reasonable for airport food. The wait staff was both attentive and friendly. Interesting considering that they seemed to be employed by HMS Host and I have had rather unpleasant dealings with that company in the past. Either way, I had a waitress/bartender that did an excellent job of both making recommendations and ensuring I had what I needed to enjoy a great meal..  I have eaten here a couple other times in the past and the food/delivery of service have been consistent experiences.  Would definitely recommend this place to anyone with an hour or longer layover at the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport.",

Umm, if you try to take a grab and go sushi and eat it there, they will give you attitude, just sayin'",

We were looking for a place to eat in the airport other than Burger King or some fast food place.  From a distance, this place just looks like a bar.  Liquor bottles lining shelves around a bar inside the airport.  I did not see one cook like the pictures show below.  Anywho, we order a sandwich from Quizno's which is will be a Yelp in itself.  There was no place to sit in this airport.  Because of all the flight delays, the airport was crowded but this place had a bunch of empty tables in the center by their bar and stores.  Now I know why. My co-worker and I set our stuff down and she leaves to use the restroom.  Up walks what appeared to be cleaning staff.  She certainly didn't look like a waitress and asks me if I'm ordering anything off the menu.  I said, you mean liquor? I said, maybe after I eat.  Broomhilda says in crusty tone, \"no, food\".  I laughed and said, honey all I see is liquor and I may need some of that after I eat.  She proceeds to talk to me in her crusty tone and said, I can't sit there unless I order from the menu.  Since I've been gate raped by TSA in the past, I figured I don't want to create a security scene and I take our food and move along.  I really wanted to tell her to stick her attitude up her hoohah and stick to cleaning tables.  Question below: Waiter Service? How about Biatch Service.",

    "text": "I've never spent time in North Carolina, but in the last three months, I've had two layovers in CLT.  Both were very annoying, and both fell during mealtime.  I went to Hissho to eat both times.  The first time, I was rushing to make my connecting flight and stopped off on Hissho to grab a roll.  There was a refrigerated section of to-go food, and the selection was pretty good - standard, sure, but a lot of options.  It took me a minute to pick an eel roll.  I ate it on the plane, and it was good.  It reminded me of the pre-packaged rolls I used to love at the cafeteria in college.  Nothing special, maybe, but satisfying.  So when I passed by Hissho in the same airport on a longer layover just a couple months later, I decided to sit down for some dinner.  I thought about getting another ready-to-go roll, but I made the mistake of opening the menu.  I had just heard Jonathan Gold review a Sinaloan sushi spot on the radio, and he said something like, \"It was good in the way chili fries are good,\" and for some reason that resulted in my ordering something called a Mango Trio.  It was an 8 piece roll with imitation crab, mango, cucumber, and mango-ginger cheese topped with salmon, tuna, and a mango habanero sauce.  I mean what the hell is mango-ginger cheese?  Anyway, the roll was edible but vaguely disgusting, with mediocre fish and an odd, goopy sauce.  My other big mistake was getting a drink.  I'm a sucker for a spicy bloody mary, and when I saw a chipotle bloody on the menu I decided to go for it.  It was the most disgusting bloody mary I've had in recent memory, very strong with a tinge of thin tomato and a bit of spice.  It had a double shot of vodka, so I guess it was at least functional.  When I got the check, though, I was shocked to see that it cost $14.  My shitty airport meal cost over $30.  Incidentally, service was also very slow.  Surprising considering the setting.  I left for my flight feeling foolish.  I would've been happier with a spicy tuna in a plastic container.  I may come back to Hissho when I fly through CLT, but I won't sit down again.",

I spied this sushi place, noticed it was made to order so I bellied up to the bar and gave it a shot.    Shay was working behind the bar.  She was just the friendly face I needed after a long day.  She's very easy on the eyes too, which also did not hurt. I ordered a simple California roll and a bud light.  Shay brought my beer and continued to engage me in polite chat (and yes, you will download candy crush again) until my sushi was done.  It arrived warm (sign of it being fresh), 8 pieces, ample pickled ginger with wasabi.  It was pretty good for airport food, sushi notwithstanding.  I almost went for the miso soup too but I passed - did not want to be too full.   No complaints about the food whatsoever.    So why 4 and not 5 stars??  $7.99 for a bud light draft.  That's crazy!  The sushi was $8!  I know airport food can be pricy but really?  Anyway give them a try. Everything I saw the sushi chefs making looked spectacular.",

I was there today right after the lunch rush, which may have been why the sushi rice was warm. I ordered the Wilbur and Orville roll; I would equate it to a fancier grocery store sushi, where they make it in front of you...however, the rice temp was really distracting.

The thought of ingesting heavy, fried or BBQ anything while I'm sitting in an airport or on a plane was not a pleasant thought.  Sushi!  At an airport!  What a concept.  Except this is not really good sushi.  In fact, it's not very good sushi at all.  The offerings on the menu to be made fresh for you are quite steep in price.  I opted for the pre-made California roll, which was no bargain at $8.95.  Throw in a 500 mL bottle of Fiji Water for $3.95 and it wasn't an economically priced option, either.  Yeah, I know it's airport food.  But I would have justified the cost if I had eaten the whole thing (which I did not).  I yearned to sit in one of those big white rockers as I was eating, so I took my to-go stuff and started to relax.  Except I was given no napkins or chopsticks.  Walk back and get them.  Chopsticks were actually miniature-sized baseball bats.  Very difficult to work with.  Fingers would have been a better utensil and wished I'd thrown caution to the wind and just used those instead from the beginning as I probably looked pretty clumsy fiddling with the awkwardness of the equipment provided.  Not enough wasabi provided.  The actual sushi was rather tasteless with rice that was part sticky and part soggy.  The rolls didn't hold together and fell apart as I'd try to pick them up (refer to previous comment about the use of fingers).  Grocery store sushi is gourmet compared to this fare. I consumed about half of it before giving up on the taste, texture and struggle of getting it from container to mouth.  My Fiji water was good, though!  For $3.95 it should have been.",

I'm sure they have massively strict regulations on what they can bring in, how they bring it in, etc.   I got stuck at the airport for about 6 hours. It wasn't a long enough time to justify me paying for a cab to go anywhere and then another to come back. I'd be spending $40 for a few hours at home, versus copping out $16 for an overpriced sub-par meal. I chose the meal and wandering around the airport for a few hours. Note: airports are really fascinating and they always have the weirdest, most random art.   Miso soup, some kind of vegetarian sushi, and a seaweed salad. I think two of these were a combo of some sort. The miso soup was surprisingly good, also nice and hot. The dinky plastic spoon I had to eat it from was sort of lame, though. That can't be helped. The sushi was adequate, about a half-step up from supermarket deli sushi. And the seaweed salad was just fine.   Would I pay as much as I did outside of an airport for this quality of food? Heck, no!   Was I completely grateful for a place that didn't just serve heaps of meat, fried stuff, slathered-in-cheese stuff, or some other kind of nasty, unhealthful super processed carby stuff?   Absolutely.",

Sushi rolls were prepared in front of me, but the shrimp tempura tasted soggy and flavorless, which was disappointing. California roll was better, and I like how they used cucumber. Total for two rolls: shrimp tempura and California rolls was ~$18. Whattttt?   Didn't have a chance to try their other rolls but you may have better luck finding a cheaper eat elsewhere in the food court.",

    "text": "I seem to go thru CLT airport as a connecting airport during my air travels quite frequently. When I first discovered the Hissho sushi \"bar\" at the First In Flight bar in the main food area/concourse at CLT in 2010, I was quite amazed, simply at the very fact of finding suchis available at an airport, and particularly at an airport in the Carolinas!  Well, I was even more amazed when I tried their pre-packaged sushi and sashimi from the to-go cooler. I have eaten sushi at sushi restaurants all across the US, and I had to admit that the quality of the take-out sushi and sashimi from Hissho was quite good.  I have, in the intervening 4 or 5 years, eaten their pre-packaged take-out sushi and sashimi from their take-out cooler many times, and I have NEVER been dissapointed with the freshness, quality or flavor. In fact, if my total time to my destination (whether my destination hotel, or my home, if returning home) after I leave CLT will be less than 3 hours, I often purchase two or three extra packages of sushi to bring to my destination and pop in the refrigerator, to be eaten within the next 48 hours.  BTW, I have never tried to sit down at the bar or at a table to order freshly-made sushi here; I have only purchased pre-packaged take-out sushi and sashimi from their take-out cooler!  Pricing is not bad at all for airport food, much less for good-quality airport sushi!",

My main reason for three stars? Everything was spicy! Spicy mayo on this, spicy sauce on that, super spicy spicy roll with spiciness.  Do I want Sriracha? On sushi? Really? How about Wasabi that isn't brown.   Guys - we understand you're not flying fish in from japan to your booth - (though god knows why not because you're in a freaking AIRPORT!!!) - but covering up the medium quality fish with spicy everything doesn't help the stomachs of people who have been traveling for days - or weeks.  Give us some simple offerings, talk up the hand rolls more, and either expand you menu to show the full range of what you can offer or select a competent hostess who can make real suggestions on food.  Excellent wine bar for an airport. Thumbs up.",

My most recent stop in was just last week - picked up a roll for takeaway as I only had 30m between connecting flights.  The restaurant is located in an open area of the main 'between terminal wings' area so there isn't an enclosed seating area - the closest you can get to outdoor seating while being inside an airport terminal.    Being that the customers are usually on the way to somewhere else, the staff are used to serving at a pace to keep everyone moving it seems.  Not in a pushy way to get you out, just swift enough to keep you moving on time to your final destination.    The sushi won't make you sick and it is a refreshing change from the usual fare of deep-fried and greasy food you get in airport terminals.",

While it's mediocre sushi in the grand scheme of restaurants that exist *outside of airports* Hissho presents an alternative to burgers, sandwiches, and assorted fast food that litters CDI. Got the \"first in flight\" with miso soup and sat down to eat at their bar instead of walking away with prepared sushi. It's always nice to watch the chef make your food fresh and if you pause to eat there it ends up being a bit cheaper and you can see where your food is coming from.

    "text": "First in Flight used to be a bunch of tables and a bar, but as of a couple months ago, it expanded into a sushi-piano bar serving sashimi, special rolls, and a variety of beers/cocktails. Rolls run between $8-$12. Apps include Edamame, Seaweed and Squid Salad, Tuna Poke and Sashimi plates ($5-$8).  Our waitress, Amber, is a little on the slow side with the turnaround for food/drinks, but she is one of the nicest waitresses I have ever met! The sushi is probably a 2 star, but if you're craving it you may as well come here since Charlotte sushi options are dismal. You also won't find anything even close to sushi in this airport unless you want to get some broccoli beef at Mandarin Express. Yeah.... not the same.  I would recommend the Sky Captain because the yellow tail in ponzu sauce is quite fresh. The seaweed salad is what you would expect and served in a decently sized portion for airport standards for $5. The Orville is pretty good but has alot of sweet sauce on top. The Queen Charlotte is not bad, but kind of bland because it's composed of a bland soggy tempura shrimp. And the International Roll would probably be my favorite because I love eel and it's hard to mess up eel.  If I have any recommendations for the business, I would improve the quality of the sushi rice.",

Do yourself a favor if you like spicy and go with the CLT Roll but make sure you add some wasabi too if you really like spicy.   The bar area also provides a full length power strip underneath so you can charge a multitude of devices. Given that CLT isn't the most charge-friendly airport this is a huge bonus.   Draft beers are reasonably priced for an airport at $8 for a pint, but I'm sure if you wanted to drink cheaper, you could find it elsewhere.

Not even one of the fifteen choices you have on the list?).  -1 star for old wasabi and the tiny amount of spicy salmon in the spicy salmon roll.    -1 star for paying $3.50 for a tiny bowl of rice.  Honestly, that rice cost you about $0.30 to cook and prepare.  So, that makes your markup about 1166%.  That is kind of egregious - reminds me of the business practices of many banks.

    "text": "For a grungy airport sushi joint, this place somehow lowers the bar thanks to a nasty employee / chair police named Shay.  First, Shay prevented me from sitting at one of the many vacant tables (in reach of an elusive airport power outlet) and said it is for customers only.  I apologized and asked for a menu.    10 minutes go by, no Shay, no menu, so I go up to the bar and order there.  Within seconds, my power outlet chair has been taken by another dude!  Needless to say I tried to stretch out my California roll (tasted more like a New Jersey roll) as long as possible to remain a customer, while keeping a watchful eye on the chair/outlet bandit.. he never ordered food!  Fast forward another 10 minutes: New Jersey roll is done, guy leaves, and I promptly zip back to my outlet seat before it gets hijacked again.  Enter Shay, act 2. She comes back and literally threatens to call security if I don't move, totally unaware that I'd been at the bar eating for the past 10 mins!  She refuses to believe me until I flag down the chef at the bar who prepared my food to vouch for me. Very embarrassing.  I likely was never coming back here at all in the first place - but come on, Shay!  R-e-s-p-e-c-t, find out what I means to me. I understand that the restaurants chairs are your responsibility - but learn which battles to pick and maybe take it down a notch, kthnx!",

I found myself quite impressed with the prices. I was expecting to pay sky high prices (clever pun, yes, I know), but instead they were only standard expensive sushi prices.  I never had seaweed salad before trying it at this stand and it was astounding (It's such a proud moment for mom and dad when baby first tries seaweed salad). I was a little slimy, but crunchy and flavorful. I can't wait to get it again so I can compare.  Also had a Grand Finale sushi roll. It was avocado and fried shrimp wrapped in seaweed roll and rice, and topped with crab meat and red + black tobiku (What the hell is tobiku?). It sounds better than it was, but it still hit the spot covering my craving for deep sea delectables... and, uhm, tobiku.",

The shrimp tempura is not fried on site and is prepackaged in a huge bag, pulled from the refrigerator, piled onto a plate about four deep, then microwaved and set onto the kitchen prep area.  When it is served inside a roll, all you can taste is soggy breading. The spicy crab topping was even worse and had the consistency of finely chopped up bread wth orange food coloring.

He was working with what he had and his presentation was very good. Oh! I got the poke seasoned and on a bed of sea weed. I enjoyed the poke which would of been much better if the fish was firmer. There was no fishy taste or smell just not as firm as I would of liked. Will I go back? If in the airport on another visit to Charlotte I would probably try them again.",

I've never had a good experience before with airport sushi and you gotta imagine on a scale of Jiro Dreams of Sushi down to convenience-store-in-the-middle-of-nowhere sushi, Hissho Sushi ranks like the white fish in a chirashi bowl. You don't really need it but you'll eat it.   Really this deserves a 3.5 rating as it's located in a modern area of the airport that is borderline chic. You'd imagine sushi would be sold here is what I'm saying.   Our rolls really weren't bad at all. Actually it was surprisingly good if you're considering where you are in the U.S. The rolls themselves were not even absurdly priced. Ours were about 10-14 dollars. The fish quality was decent too.   So I'd put Hissho and Bojangles as two places to eat in Charlotte's airport.",

Flavor was decent, nothing I wii crave but it was healthier than most  airport options and was a positive experience overall. Spicy crab had a kick but was a minor player in overall taste.  Hot green tea tasted good, but mine was served in a paper cup. Service quick, efficient and pleasant all the way through.",

The drinks were good and not watered down. The bartender was great and very attentive. I waited just a couple minutes before he asked to help.   The taste of the Orville & Wilbur's Roll was good. For being in an airport, the quality was decent. Not a top rated sushi restaurant but definitely good for air port quality. The sweet chili sauce on this roll was not overly heavy and let the tuna flavor come through. The spicy crab inside was excellent.   For seating, there were tons of high top tables or bar options. Because food cane or quite quick, you would not have to wait long even if they were full.   Overall, I highly recommend this stop if your on a layover and have a need for some sushi.",

This nasty nasty blonde lady (didn't catch her name), says \"well you're going to need to find a seat at the bar top I have other things to get to\". So I patiently wait for a seat to open up, one finally does, but I can't sit because she would not clean off the last persons spot. As I'm standing there waiting, she is making rude comments like \"some people need to learn patience\" and I said \"well if I was sitting I would be able to wait but I'm trying to go catch my flight\". She walks away with a huge huff. After 20 minutes of avoiding me or making eye contact, she comes over FINALLY clears the place for me to sit, the goes I'll be with you in a minute. I politely said Ok great. She then does not come back for another 10 minutes saying sorry it's busy she's trying her best. Now it's about 30 minutes of waiting to place an order after being spoken to rudely at every interaction. Another lady came up during this time and asked about order and the blonde lady again got loud with her telling her to find a seat and she'll get to her when she gets to her. Finally, the sushi chef asked if she took my order and I said no she has been ignoring me every time I try to order. She then raises her voice at me and says \"well you're not sitting Are you eating here or not\" I said \"no, I specifically asked where to go to order take out and you told me the bar ma'am. I have been here over a half hour now and all you've done is huff and made snide comments\" she looked around for someone to defend her and said \"we'll we don't do that here\" but the other 6 tables looked and agreed she was being rude. Needless to say, I wish I got her name so I can contact her manager and complain there as well because she has made me waste a good chunk of time versus telling me from the start \"we don't do take out\". Additionally, the plates are disposable plastic, I could have easily taken the plate with me as she was throwing them out after people left anyway. She didn't apologize or show any remorse for the inconvenience. This was a horrible horrible experience.",

The service is super fast. I sat at the bar, the bartender quickly grabbed my drink and kept an eye on me until I was ready to order. I got the Ocean's Delight roll with tuna, yellow tail, salmon, avocado, cucumber, and lettuce. It came out in less than 10min! Some of the fastest sushi I've ever had, but in fact that does have an impact on the end product. It was decent. The rolls were thinly sliced and the rice was bland. It needed soy sauce to give it a boost. Of course, being airport sushi it was expensive for an ok final product - $13 for the roll (8 pieces). But if you're going to get airport sushi, this spot is worth a stop.",

    "text": "3.5/5 (considering this is from an airport in SC...) I just got back from a trip where I basically haven't had sushi for over 2 weeks and as a sushi addict I needed a fix as soon as I saw a place.  I walked past this place over and over I'm sure if I really should give it a shot but there's not very many other fresh/lighter options in the airport so I went for it and honestly I'm not mad.  There is bar seating and a few tables or you can pick up food from the takeout display. Though the stuff in the display definitely looked like it's been sitting out there for a bit and I wouldn't go for it. I ended up sitting at one of the tables and the waitress helped me out right away. Service was very friendly and prompt the entire time. Menu prices are definitely a little ridiculous for both the sushi and any of the side items. I'm not sure if it's because it's in South Carolina or because it's airport food but I would say everything is approximately $3 more than you would be paying anywhere else.  As far as the quality of the sushi goes the price is actually semi decent. Fairly sticky texture without being too mushy or too hard and the vinegary sweetness is actually quite noticeable. Not my ideal ratios but better than underseasoned rice. The fish quality is not the best but also could be worse. I didn't get sick from it and there was a decent firmness with some flavor for the hamachi.  I ordered the crown temple roll and an order of the hamachi nigiri. The rolls are very sizable and the majority of them contain tempura sushi which I'm not a huge fan of in rolls. The crown temple roll was basically just 3 shades of mild spiciness (Sriracha, wasabi, jalapeno) with some tuna and it wasn't too interesting but not bad either. The hamachi nigiri was also pretty good. The cut of fish was sizable but not too thick and the rice was well flavored. The ratio of rice to fish was a little much but that's an easy fix. The hamachi was actually quite fatty and flavorful which I was surprised by.  Overall I left very full and pretty content. For airport sushi I'm pretty impressed. Assuming the prices are just cuz of the airport location, then it's not a bad spot.",

The wine came out in a very cute square PLASTIC wine glass. I almost spilled it on myself trying to drink out of it, but quickly got the hang of it. My edamame arrived in a plastic dish with a plastic cup to discard the shells. I finished those and my sushi rolls were delivered on a plastic plate. See the theme here--plastic.

I only had about an hour to munch on something. They have a sake on tap. The Bushido, way of the warrior sake. It is filtered and suitable for what I was looking for. They do not have a nigori(unfiltered sake) which was no problem. I choose the salad with ginger dressing. It was a little bit different from the plain orange ginger dressing. It was more like ginger and soy sauce combo. It worked.  I also ordered the sunset roll which contained spicy crab, avocado, cucumber with large pieces of tuna and salmon sashimi. It was perfect. It may have enough for 2 people but I managed to not leave anything. The warmth and friendliness of Gemma is what makes this place. She engages quite nicely with her customers and they react to her kindly. They also have quite a few wines and craft beers on tap. Its a good place to come during a layover or if you arrive early before your flight.",

I fly through CLT more than any other airport and very often the last thing I want before a long flight is something heavy and greasy that might upset my stomach. No way am I eating a fast food burger and getting on a plane for six hours.  The sushi bar is centrally located in the atrium in the middle of the airport with most of the other food. I usually grab a seat at the bar, listen to whoever is playing the piano and enjoy a sushi roll with some miso soup for lunch. It's just the right amount of food and they hand make the rolls to order. I've never done the grab and go because they're usually pretty quick when made fresh to order.",

Hissho Sushi is an ideal option as it is centrally located in the main atrium and they have a decent selection of premade sushi for eating here or taking to go.  The variety is good and the prices are reasonable. $14 for a higher end roll and as low as $8 or so for something not quite as fancy. I got a rainbow roll today and it was good. Not as good as some, but better than should be expected for airport fresh fish considering that some things are prepared off site and they're also restricted on knives here thanks to the TSA.

In *that* company, this may very well be the very best that you can hope for.   Anyhow, on to the sushi. It's about as generic as you can get - tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and various combinations thereof formed into rolls. Speaking of which, get the rolls, they're, at the least, acceptable, and the various stuff they put on top of them at least gives them some form of flavor...  The beer is cold (there is Kirin), so, well, theres that (though, for whatever reason, they're all served in cheesy plastic cups)  Oh, btw, stay away from the eel (unagi) - it's pretty foul...",

As I approached the register over at the Ciao gourmet place next door. There was nobody at all working the Hissho stand when I took my sushi from the self service cooler in the front, although halfway thru eating, Hissho workers appeared.  I noticed the cashier at Ciao and two other workers were chatting.  I stood behind worker number 2 as she blocked me from approaching the register.  They were talking about some other coworker apparently, glanced at me standing there with my sushi, drink, and bags, rolled her eyes and turned around to finish her conversation.  Not moving an inch, acknowledging, or greeting me.  After a long 20 seconds she decides her conversation was done and decided to allow me to approach and put my stuff down.  The register girl went from laughing with her friends to scowling at me.  F these lazy POS workers.  Better yet fire them.",

The tuna wasn't swimming in spicy mayo which was great, it had a light dressing on it and just your typical seaweek salad.  Very flavorful and not as heavy as having a sushi roll, so at least when you get on your flight you're not weighed down.  The gyoza was just a standard gyoza but I ordered it in case the tuna wasn't enough to keep me full, so at least this way I had a bit of meat for heartiness.",

I ended up getting prepackaged rolls, salmon avocado and tuna rolls so I can't judge the freshly made stuff. At best they were just below average and rather flavorless. The wasabi was weak and fake (horseradish, mustard and peppers.) And the prepackaged stuff also has very little ginger but they will give you more of you just ask. Prices were reasonable for the amount you get especially at an airport. About $8 for each tray which had 16 small pieces. In the end. The it wasn't terrible but will try something else when I'm here again.",

I really dug the ambience here with the piano being played right next to the venue.  The options were amazing but the service was STELLAR from a server named Jamie.  She did not miss a beat and I witnessed various customers openly letting her know how happy they were with her.  I also noticed that there was even one customer offering his business card to come work for his business!  I am giving this score mostly because the service was so good but also because the sushi itself was good. Go get you some!",

It looked good so I thought that dining there would have better food and cheap options.  Not True. What can I expect though, I'm at an airport. I should've gone to an actually restaurant rather than sushi.   I ended up getting the CLT Roll. It was okay. It is spicy but that's expected from a roll with jalapenos there was a lot of sauce on it m could've masked the flavor of the sushi. What I didn't like was my yellowtail nigiri. I get yellow tail wherever I go and this was no good.  It was thickly sliced, and I don't know why, but part of it was chewy. So chewy, that I couldn't tear it with my teeth and I ended up not eating that piece. Total, my bill was $19. I should've stuck with the bento box. It would've been more filling and the better price point.",

I had never really noticed there was a sushi option at Charlotte Douglas, but I was sort of excited instead of having to eat any of the fast food fare.  I ordered a tall beer, edamame, and 2 sushi rolls.  The server was friendly enough and there was a pretty busy Friday crowd going.  I think the best thing that this place had going for it was it's location:  around the flying mobile of various flying machines in the center of the terminal and also next to the grand piano (that someone was playing that night).  The lady was playing up-tempo contemporary pop songs on the piano and was quite good.  It was nice to listen and realize you are listening to Lady Gaga on the piano while having sushi.  The beer was excellent, unfortunately that was the high point of the meal.  The edamame seemed re-heated... not really freshly steamed... and the sushi rolls had a \"not-so-fresh\" feel to them.  I'm sure they rolled them after I ordered, but the ingredients may not have been the best.  I did manage to eat everything... but was left wanting since my bill came up to close to $40 bucks (for one person!).  Now I know eating sushi can get pretty pricey, but I think the concept of sushi + airport location made for a runaway pricing situation......  not to mention $10 for a beer!",

The setup for this place is basically a kiosk.   They have prepackaged sushi and what they call a \"dine in\" menu for fresh sushi but you can't dine in because it's not a restaurant.   It's a kiosk (which seems haphazardly placed in whatever open spot could be found in the middle section of the food court).  There are bar stools placed around the kiosk for the so called \"dine in\" experience.  There was barely enough elbow room between the stools.  If you add to that the fact that most people would have luggage because it's located at the airport, then you are talking even less comfortable space for dining.    So...for that reason, I decided to get a prepackaged tray of california rolls, because how could you mess up a basic california roll. There were nine rolls in my tray.  it was reasonably priced and it tastes pretty much like any other tray of california rolls.  It was enough to feel me up before my next flight.  So, I was satisfied.  That's it...it was just enough, nothing special.  So for that reason, it gets 3 stars.",

The waitress constantly checked up to see how things were going. But that's not enough for me to come back to this place. The sushi was absolutely HORRENDOUS!  I ordered the edamame and the grand finale specialty roll (Shrimp Tempura, Avocado & Cucumber Topped With Spicy Crab Scallions, Red & Black Tobiko).  The edamame was OK, but not the best I've had. The sushi was horrible! Way too much rice around the roll (felt like rubber while chewing). The shrimp tempura itself was disgusting. It honestly tasted like cardboard. Despite the massive amount of soy sauce and wasabi I put on the rolls, the sushi still didn't taste like anything except for cardboard! That's when you know you have some stale sushi my friends!

    "text": "You must think... I must not know anything about sushi to think this place has 5 star sushi quality. But before you judge me, let me share my reasoning. Guys, I'm at an airport, in Charlotte NC and I am sure not looking for the best meal of my life. I just want to not feel hungry, not break the bank and just. go. home! I'm tired of eating greasy and fried food at the airport and also tired of sitting at a food court with dirty chairs and tables. When I saw Hissho Sushi, my heart soared.  They have a twist to traditional rolls. i.e. they added a tangy, spicy mango sauce over the typical rainbow roll (tuna, white fish and salmon on california rolls). I always dip my sushi in the little plate of soy sauce and wasabi, but here, my cute sushi rolls are taking a quick dive in this special sauce. I must say, it is quite different but it tastes so refreshing and good!  The best part is, I feel GREAT after eating there. It doesn't make me feel disgusted like after eating a burger or a plate of fries. It was uplifting and gave me hope that should anything go wrong at the airport, they will be there to comfort me with a fresh plate of sushi.   Service is awesome. They have 2 hostess and each of them serves 50% of the tables. I wasn't sure how it works but if you see a table, grab it! The hostess will then come to you and take your order. There is no line but a first come first serve basis. The hostess checked on me every so often and made sure my water glass was full. Also, they have the prettiest disposable plates ever! I know, I'm OCD. Although they are disposable plastic plates, they look super elegant and clean in white. They made my dish look extra posh. How awesome was that?!   This is definitely my place to go to when I'm in, through or stuck in CLT. Great job guys!",

    "text": "I stumbled upon this restaurant during a layover. The bar seating was nice and there was also some hidden outlets underneath it. I took a moment to look over the menu and decided to stay.   I had the tempura shrimp temaki. It was good, not overly delicious, but good. The temaki is a hand roll. The sushi is rolled almost like a burrito and you just grab it and bite. The thing that made this only good and not great is the shrimp. They use already prepared tempura shrimp, not cool. The tempura isn't crisp and it gives a packaged sushi taste to a fresh roll.   The waiters are very friendly and attentive. Overall, I would eat here again if I have another layover at this airport.",

Waited 15 minutes to see a waiter, another 25 to get my food (3 people that came after me and had different servers got their orders first), and another 20 to get my check (which I ended up having to ask the hostess for since the waiter was MIA). Once again, the sushi was great - fresh and numerous options. I strongly suggest you get it to go and eat at your gate.",

    "text": "When you travel a lot, sometimes consistency is a great thing.  Is it the best sushi you'll ever have? No. Is it possible to use the words \"airport\" and \"sushi\" in the same sentence without looking like a twit? Absolutely. To digress, the best airport sushi I've ever had is at Detroit Metro, followed closely by the one at Reagan.   This place isn't perfect by any stretch. Just about any non-fish item is nuked-while-you-wait (like soup or edamame) and served on plastic. However, the fish isn't bad. Stick with the rolls. They're all fairly good and, from a frequent traveler's standpoint, consistent visit after visit.   I've been eating here for several years now, and it's definitely one of the healthier options at CLT.",

That doesn't make it a good deal, just one considering where your at.  I figured it up and there was a bento box that saved you a couple bucks over buying the items seperately.  The seaweed salad and spicy tuna was good, the fish was fresh, and the chefs were really quick with it.  All this said, if I paid this much for mediocre sushi at a regular restaurant, this would be a 1-2 star review.",

During the hustle and bustle of traveling, it's always a nice feeling when I have a little extra time during a layover in the Queen City so I can relax for a few moments here.  Sushi in Charlotte. This may not be the first type of food that you think about when you are in the Carolinas, but it's here...and there is a lot of great sushi here. I wouldn't put Hissho up in the \"great\" category, but it's decent, and coupled with its \"great\" location...it's one of my regular stops across the country.   All of the sushi that I've gotten here has been fresh. The specialty rolls are a little heavy, but good. They do have a lot of options with cream cheese or spicy sriracha. I haven't tried any of their sashimi...I just don't think that this is the spot for it.   I definitely recommend the next time you fly into Charlotte, and have a little extra time during your layover, give it a go. Relax, sit at a table, have a drink and roll or two, and people watch until your departure time arrives. It's the perfect time waster.",

Now normally I am fine with low expectations, but the prices here are what you'd expect to pay for pretty decent sushi - not frozen fish. No disrespect to the chef, since the menu was fun and the rolls were creative, but charging $15 for a roll made with frozen tuna isn't gonna earn you a high review.  Expect grocery-store sushi taste.  This is a great place for people watching, which almost earns it 3 stars.  But not quite.",
