Second basket cold stale and left in the basket. Service was also good and bad. Our order was taken promptly and served equally as fast. Unfortunately, we waited longer for our check and to cash than it took to order and get our food. The Carmallita's Burrito was ordered with shredded chicken and was very satisfying. The Tequila Burrito was prepared with chicken breast with a smokey mesquite sauce. The chicken was diced so small it was crunchy and the lack of sauce made the dish a solid \"2 stars\". Inconsistencies made our experience a 2.5 star experience but...it is what it is!",

We had to ask several times for tortillas as the other people around us got theirs before us.  But the most annoying part of our visit is that we purposely ate out for my son's 12 birthday. I told someone right away that it was his birthday, and he sounded excited and positive about it. They did nothing special for it at all. Usually there is some singing and fanfare at the table, with maybe a small dessert. Nothing. Later the waitress claimed she had no idea. I did not realize I should tell multiple people about the birthday. It's the little things ....",

    "text": "I had Cabo's bookmarked forever and finally got to try it for a late lunch one Friday - I was truly sorry  I waited so long, as it is relatively close to my home.  Located at the back of Carmel Commons, off of Carmel Rd, the parking spaces seemed a bit narrow, so I parked at the end of the lot as to not get my doors banged up.  On a Friday around 2:00, there wasn't much of a crowd at all and I was quickly seated and then almost immediately greeted by my server.  My drink order of a Coke Zero was brought quickly and kept filled.  I really enjoyed the complimentary salsa and tortilla chips.  The salsa is a well blended mix of tomatoes and other ingredients, which is what I prefer to the chunkier salsas.  It was also not overwhelmingly cilantro'ed, which I was very happy about.  An order of cheese dip came quickly to the table and it was delicious.  Creamy and well flavored, and the tortilla chips were perfectly salted and held up well to the queso.  My lunch order was a steak Chimichanga - shredded beef in a flour tortilla, covered with queso and served with rice and beans.  The rice beans were both mexican restaurant standard issue, though better than most.  The beans were a good consistency and the rice wasn't a dried out mess.  The meat inside of the chimichanga was well seasoned.  Though I had to unbutton my pants, I did finish my lunch and it was very good.  Service was excellent.  Price was average.  I will definitely return to Cabo's.",

We were immediately seated, there were not many tables left as it was packed!  Chips and Salsa were immediately placed on our table, I love their chips and salsa, not my favorite, but I still really enjoy them!  They are quick to refil as well.   I ordered a mixed drink from their menu as I did last time, but this time it came in a small glass whereas the last time it came in a huge bowl sized glass!  I wish their menu would designate the sizes, prices, etc. so you have an idea of what you are ordering.  Sometimes you want to share for a big drink and sometimes you just want a small cocktail.  Their food is awsome, I really love the flavoring that they put on their chicken!  I ordered the fajhita chimichanga and Kevin got one of their plates that came with a bunch of different items.  Both plates were excellent.  You get plenty of food for the price, I had plenty to take home with me for another day!  We will be back, hopefully sooner than our probably 8 month hiatus!",

Today I ordered the fish tacos with tortilla soup for lunch. The tacos were boring, just whitefish in a flour tortilla. They had very little seasoning, and could definitely have benefitted from some additional components. The soup has always been a favorite of mine, but today it just seemed kind of haphazardly put together.  The food is not bad, and I'm sure I'll be back, it just seems as time has gone on cabo's has fallen into a certain level of apathy.",

When we were ready to go, we had to flag down the manager to get our check and process the payment.  Because the food was good, I think we will give it another try.

Portions are big and it's a good value.  I like how they have the standard tortilla, meat, bean, rice combos, but then have Latin American specials here as well.  I usually pick one of the options from there.   The chips are thicker than I'd like, but still great.  If it's your birthday they give you a flaming shot!  Great place for adult birthday parties.",

There is a bar area, and TVs around the perimeter of the entire place. They DO have wifi, which is great. The food is what's disappointing. It is either bland or mushy, depending on what you order. The soup we had with fish tacos was very oily/greasy. We exchanged it for chicken soup, which was salty salty.

DRINKS: This was quite the ordeal! I asked for a strawberry mango FROZEN daiquiri. It came out as mango and I asked where the strawberry mango one was and the waitress said it was coming and this was the regular mango. However, my friend and I both ordered the strawberry mango. The drink comes out again....watery, with NO alcohol. Really?? So I told them the drink was wrong again and it needed alcohol. They brought the drink out again with the rum on top [my friend didnt want the drink at this point] and still watery. I then had to ask them whether the drink was frozen. FINALLY THE FOURTH TIME MY DRINK CAME OUT OK. $6.75 and the manager did not apologize nor make any accommodations on the menu. Which is fine, but you should have apologized. The waitress only understood what was wrong with the drink once I said it in Spanish.   FOOD: The chips and salsa are pretty good. You get them upon sitting down, and the salsa is a little spicy. They are not that cheap, but not too expensive. I had the beef baja empanadas and they were $9. You get three normal [big] empanadas. The value is pretty good however even in the city these are $2 maximum so its a bit pricey. Now they are a Mexican restaurant and I personally do not eat Mexican food especially if it is spicy. Luckily they have other latin dishes. I had rope vieja with yellow rice and maduros. It was sooooo good!!! I ordered an extra side of maduros [fried sweet plantains] and for $4 you get at least 8 of them.  They don't give bags for the food you bring home. Unfortunately because of this I left my food on the table. $35 for just myself. An entree, appetizer, and drink. It was good but all that hassle, SMH!",

The live music can be kinda loud, but that is easily overlooked for how good the food is. I could easily eat here several times and weeks and be perfectly fine with that. Prices are good for the quality of food. Gotta get cheese dip, that stuff is addicting.",

    "text": "Friday night, no wait.  Our server was adequate, with other things on his mind than finishing his shift.  We god served, but boy did he exude how much he REALLY didn't want to be there! The chips and salsa came out very quick.  There's some heat to the salsa, so I was content.  A lot of interesting things on the menu, that I think if they were executed well I would be willing to try.  But I got a combo of a \"burrito\" and a soft taco.  The taco was decent and unmemorable, the burrito was boiled flavorless chicken breast meat, wrapped in a tortilla (not the monster sized ones people generally expect with burritos, the regular size) and some kind of brown sauce on it.  Sort of looked like a crappy enchilada to me, but whatever I was hungry and yummy salsa and chips were not going to cut it.  Again no flavor to the side of rice AND I thought I was getting beans with it.  When he was placing our order, HE asked me if I wanted beans and rice as my side.  I asked if I could have black beans and he said yes.  My meal came with just rice.  I'm not really sure why he asked me if I wanted something and then didn't serve it...  I stole food from my mealmate and his refried beans (that no one asked him if he wanted or not) was definitely from a can... but flavorful.  The chile relleno I also stole a bite of was not very good either.   If you want flavorful and filling Tex Mex, message me and I'll give you some better suggestions than this place.",

Once being seated the table was dirty at which time I asked if they could wipe it down, and got a very rude look. I ordered chicken fajitas, which arrived in less than five minutes. Nice, but scary they arrived that quick. Well, I know why. It seems to me they had everything prepped and basically heated the fajita platter. The chicken was very dry and the onions, peppers, and tomatoes were so overlooked and it seemed to have a burnt smell. The side plate of rice of rice and beans was so cold and bland. I will say although the chips sucked the salsa was somewhat decent. Overall, such a disappointment.",

Not just the standard \"commercial Mexican\" fare; they have a couple of Cuban, Puerto Rican, Peruvian, and other Latin dishes, so you are not limited to Mexican alone.  They also have an extensive drink menu.  2.  Atmosphere is great - bright, energetic decor, fun environment, nice bar, open-concept design.  It's a nice place to hang out.  3.  The quality of the food is really good, and so is the selction.    4.  The service is good.  I was there at a weird time, and they only had 2 servers, and there were quite a few tables of people eating.  They were busy, but they still did a good job.  I'm sure that, during peak times, they are well-staffed and attentive.  I had the Arrachera, which I haven't seen on a menu since my last trip to Celaya, Mexico.  It was excellent.  The beans and rice were very good, and the meat was grilled with bell pepper, onion, and jalapenos.  They served it with a salsa that was insanely spicy.  Probably a bit much for most people, but SOOOOOO good!  The combo of the jalapeno strips and the salsa had my mouth on fire for a while.  A True Mexican experience!",

We had fajita chimichangas and they were great. Same with the beans and rice. I was really impressed with the live music. When I saw the guy setting up his guitar I got worried because I didn't want it to be too loud but he played at a reasonable level and it really enhanced the mood of the restaurant. Thanks for the great night Cabo's",

If you go, sip your drink, not sure when that water re-fill will come back around.    Food quality is gross.  Both taste and appearance of the dishes is very unappetizing. Not sure how it's possible to mess up very simple dishes consisting of beans/ rice/ salsa / tortillas, but they accomplished it.    The kids meal has zero effort put into it, I think the burrito was cheese wrapped in a tortilla topped with a Mexican ketchup or something ( I had no problem telling my daughter that she didn't have to finish her meal).   By far and away the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been to.   Recommend this place to any enemies you might have.",

The quest has the right per portion of spice to cheese. With friendly helpful staff, I can't wait to try new different things on the menu. We'll be back.",

They brought her one but failed to tell her that it was $19 and change for this house margarita with a Corona. That was very disappointing to pay the bill and her margarita cost more than our meals. Ver disappointing.",

I went back the next day and he asked for my phone number and said the owner would call. Today's 3 days later - and I've not heard from anyone at Cabo's. We won't be back under any circumstances. Suggest you try another local Mexican spot. Actually any other Mexican spot would be better.",

We were a party of four and ordered different dishes. It took a long wait before the food arrived. We were munching on the chips and salsa. Chips were hot and thin but didn't have much flavor in them.  The food arrived in about 25 minutes and the waitress helped us out with our food remembering all that we ordered. The veg fajitas were bland and didn't have much vegetables other than cucumber, capsicum and onions. The veg quesadilla just contained spinach. There were no sauces or guacamole given with it. The food was too dry.  I would not recommend coming back again here.  Not a good experience overall",

Didn't even ask how I was or anything he just stared at me for a second and I had to literally figure out what he was thinking. He had an attitude he didn't smile or look like he wanted to be there. He smiled with his other table but not with me?? What the heck? I think his name was Erik I think he didn't want to serve me because I was there on my own and he thought he wasn't gonna get a good tip, but I tip well if I like the service, I didn't like it. I ordered a shrimp quesadilla. I got it and I started eating it, it was okay at best but I noticed it was super greasy and it looked like no thought was put into my food. My worse experience there yet",

    "text": "My friends and i stopped in here for dinner on New Year's Day after our first 2 choices were closed for the holiday.  The space is large with a bar to the back left and booth seating throughout. They had entertainment for the night...someone singing to tracks. It was almost like being in a karaoke bar. A mariachi band would have been more appropriate.  One of my friends and I ordered a Cabo margarita which was one of the best margaritas I've had in years.  For a meal, I ordered the Cabo special dinner which was a chicken enchilada and  chicken burrito. The flavors were good but it was really dry. The cheese was not melted and there was a small amount of sauce. I was craving moisture on this dish.  Like most Mexican places around town, service was good and they kept small baskets of chips flowing. Their salsa is flavorful but a bit on the mild side. We asked for the hot salsa which was better.  After a while the music became annoying and it was definitely too loud where you couldn't hear people across the table. Also, the music should be in the bar area, not the sit down restaurant area.  So if i could do halfsies here I would give them a 3.5 but they are not quite worth the 4 so this ends up as a 3.",

Every experience starts with homemade salsa, amazing queso and warm chips and their margaritas are huge...made with homemade mixers- agave syrup and citrus juices.

Rice and beans were standard fare, the guacamole was of a higher grade than normal baby food looking guac you get at so many.  And, the lettuce and tomato looked very fresh.   Folks, sometimes it is those little things that make a meal great or delicious, and mine was!  We each had one drink (Pina Colada and a Bob Marley), both good. Service was fast, but not rushed.

Flavorful, perfect texture, tasty filling, not old or dry - and the sauce over them is just amazing. Perfectly earthy and savory.  The Chile rellenos are amazing, too! The batter is light and crispy. Always served hot and freshly fried and filled with cheese!  The tacos, enchiladas, burritos are all great! Rice and beans, too! So much delicious flavor!  The service is great, too.

Honestly, I just didn't like this place at all...for various reasons.  First of all, the place was very poorly air conditioned. As soon as I stepped in, it felt all sticky and icky. The decor was also bit too busy...and just not all that. Just don't know how better to say it, but the place was just very substandard.   Then the food...was just bad. I ordered Steak Fajitas, and although it hit the table sizzling hot, it just didn't taste that hot. In fact, oddly enough, it barely tasted warm after a minute or two. The meat also looked and tasted dry, and totally bland...almost as if it hadn't been seasoned at all. I barely ate half of it. Same with the Mexican Rice and Beans. Just really, really bad. Pina Colada was decent, but a very skimpy portion. Overall, possibly the worst Mexican food I've had all year.    BTW, it wasn't just me. Even my husband, who LOVES Mexican food, didn't like his dish at all. Maybe we hit a bad night, but for both of us, we left thinking we could have just gone to a local El Cancun for this quality of food.  Nope...not a fan. Sorry!",

They kept the place clean and comfortable and the bar was clean and fast as it should be.  I went in once about a few months ago and it must have been 110 degrees and they said \"AC is broken\" and to boot the place looked like a mess. So I got up and left.  I was there about a week ago and figured let me grab a few drinks in my old hang out. Well, I sat down and the bar smelled like a 3rd world country street bar and whomever was bartender was no place in sight. I know 3rd world very well. If I'm going to eat/drink in such a place? I better be paying those prices which obviously is not the case in this joint. I know this is two separate times but I won't be back to my old hangout.",

They are sooooo unnecessarily expensive. You could go to any other Mexican restaurant and get things for half the price, and just as good. I really wish the would think about revising the prices.

It's also much larger on the inside than it appears from the outside, and has been a neighborhood favorite for the past 15 years.  Service is incredibly friendly from the moment you walk thru the door to the moment you leave. I ordered the lunch Chimichanga with rice and beans, topped with guac and pico for $9 and  my daughter got a couple of tacos. Everything was good but nothing really stood out except the fact that the nachos were a bit stale. In fact, overall, aside from the excellent service,  It's pretty average Mexican fare.   There is also a covered patio area that is full on most summer evenings. Also, it should be mentioned that it had a high sanitary rating. I do recommend giving it a try",

Aside from the fact that the owner and servers are always pleasant. This place is always packed on the weekend(I've been on Fridays and Saturdays) with usually a 20-25 minute wait depending on the size of your party. You can always opt to go to the bar but the seating is limited there. The high top tables are another option but usually there's also a waitlist for them. Cabo has outdoor seating as well and live music. The food comes out quick and hot. The menu can be a bit overwhelming to some, meaning ME so I just say what I want and let the server give me the 'name' of the dish. It saves me the embarrassment and them having to answer a thousand questions from me!!! The decor is old Mexico which I also love. It's just an all around good spot to try if you love Mexican food",

I ordered their taco salad as an entree and was very impressed. If I went back I'd order that again. My boyfriend had the Burrito Tequila and loved it, too. It was a pretty large portion. Overall, 5 stars and we'll be back soon!",

    "text": "After 5 months I'm updating my review. So upset. This was one or if not the best Mexican spot for me.  Had lunch with my husband last Sunday.  The place was not busy as it used to be during a Sunday by that time.  A lot of things changed since our last visit.  Our waitress... well maybe it's not the job for her. Or maybe it was her first job. What about customer service? None.  She came to us 4 times just if we were ready to order. Last one I chose, the flats with rice, guacamole, pico, etc  My husband went with a burrito.  My flats were: super oily but the chicken inside was so so dry, no flavorful at all. When I tried the rice was absolutely non flavorful. I told my husband and I decided to tell a manager. No one around. So I went to the bar, where our waitress \"Yanisel\", was cleaning some cups. Explained her what happened and I asked her if I can change my plate for a salad. She agreed after making me some questions.   Went back to our booth, and tried a chip with the salsa. Omg! It was super hot!  Waited a few minutes and my salad arrived.  We were chatting and my husband realized we didn't have almost drinks, after a few minutes, waitress came and \"asked\"?!? If we'd like more drinks... well, let me think. Of course! You don't need to ask!  Worst thing, while we were chatting and I didn't even eat 1/4 of my salad, waitress asked if we need boxes to go.  At that point we were extremely uncomfortable. I mean, we went out to have lunch, to relax, chat, but it seemed that this lady was in a rush or wanted to get rid of us.   So we said okay. Yes. It took her like 10 minutes to bring our check. We were still hungry but our foods were in the boxes.   My husband was also watching rugby, but suddenly someone changed the channel...   Thing is, we decided not coming back.",

For $11+  in the combination dinner you get a normal sized enchilada, small taco, and MAYBE 3 spoon fulls of beans and rice. I'm sorry but that's ridiculous and we aren't getting ripped off anymore! The portion sizes are much better for dining in.",

Every time I place a to-go order here, the employee on the phone is extremely rude and won't repeat the order to make sure it's correct. Every time I've ordered over the phone, the order comes out wrong. One time, the things I ordered were placed so badly in the to-go bags that the entire cup of queso spilled out in my car because the employee laid the queso on its side rather than upright. I want to keep ordering from Cabo's because I love the food but the rude employees and incorrect orders is why I won't be ordering anymore.   UPDATE: 2/24/2019  Decided to give it another try. Asked for queso instead of red sauce on my burrito but instead they just gave it to me dry. No sauce or queso at all. It was as dry as the Sahara desert.  Also PLEASE for the love of jiminy crickets toots on a hot day DO NOT put to go queso laying in the bag on its side because it spills out every time",

    "text": "Very mediocre experience. The food was pretty good, the queso was absolutely delicious, definitely the highlight of our meal. My chimichanga was tasty, and was jammed with chicken. My friend got Pollo con queso, and it looked good but had mushy tomatoes. I wish they would've been better at refilling the chips. I ordered queso but there wasn't enough chips!  My husband got the taco salad and this is why I rated it only two stars. He hates guacamole and specifically asked for none. His salad came and there was a large quantity of Guac on the top. Our waiter came and asked if everything was okay and I said \"no, actually, he asked for no guacamole\" my husband told the waiter don't worry about it, it's fine. But the waiter didn't care. All he said was \"sorry\" and walked away. That's unacceptable in my book. If there's a problem with my meal, at least pretend to care. My husband was hungry and didn't want to wait for them to remake it, but the waiter should have offered more lettuce or something.   When we walked into the restaurant at the beginning, it was awkward. I had several servers pass by me and ignore me and one almost ran into me. Overall, I won't be back because of the service. It was good food, but an indifferent waiter really ruined it.",

This place seems like it would get busy (on weekends).  The menu is a bit overwhelming, but I like that there are other offerings than the regular Tex-mex cuisine, I saw some Columbian and Ecuardorian offerings for example.  The restaurant is tucked away in Carmel Commons, but easy enough to find with a smart phone.  Since it's on the end, the parking lot is a little tricky.  Could also be because daylight savings time and the rain, but it was super dark - the business park next door has a sign up that doesn't allow business parking (with a tow number).  Had the enchiladas suizas... solid dish.  Our server was also the bartender and it seems like they do double duty on weeknights, but still good service.  Refills and endless chips and salsa here.  We were in the bar area so there are a number of TVs to watch sports and news.",

    "text": "I found this place simply by looking up Mexican restaurants near me. With \"Cano\" in the name, I was already interested, and that it was within walking distance from where I was in the shipping center - another plus! First off, I felt welcomed - I mean, I really felt at home and relaxed. Kind of reminded me of some of the restaurants we've gone to in Cancun, Playa del Carmen, or Puerto Vallarta. And they had a choice on outdoor seating - smoking and non-smoking! Since it was a wonderful evening, a slight breeze and temparutures cooled off a little, it was perfect that I could sit outdoors in the non-smoking patio - separated by 20' from the smoking patio. Now, time to peruse that menu - lots of great dishes, with even some tastes of other Latin areas - Cuba, Equador (I think), Peru - at least 8 dishes from other regions. But, I get ahead of myself, because the first thing I saw on the front-and-back menu was their family's story of their great food heritage in their home growing up in Mexico. I love a good story! Since I had not had a real meal all day I was craving an \"all-4\" meal. I chose the Santa Fe Chicken salad - grilled chicken, peppers, onions,,lettuce, tomato, Pico de gallo, and avocado (that was the fruit) with a side of queso (dairy) and since I love spicy, my waiter brought me some homemade in the house hot salsa. It want hot enough to make my forehead sweat but it was spicy and full of flavor. I will definitely be back and I'm looking forward to trying their chileqiles!",

    "text": "This once was a Mexican restaurant that I would often go to in Charlotte. Sad to say I won't be going back. I always order the exact same thing (Burrito California). Today on my lunch break my wife, son, and I went in, I placed the same order I always do, the Burrito California, and for some reason they bring me the wrong order. It happens but After the initial wrong order was taken away, they bring me a lesser version of the Burrito California that I always order, I noticed that it is missing something. I tell my waitress that something's not right and she immediately says \"oh it's missing the green salsa\" she leaves to get it for me but comes back empty handed. At this point I'm frustrated because my order still isn't right, my food is getting cold and I need to get back to work. My wife asked to speak to manager, and proceeds to tell him what's going on. He goes to the back brings out the green salsa (which the waitress failed to bring) for me to put it on myself which is something I've never had to do. On my way out he came over to apologize but it's not really an apology because he's siding with the waitress who of course tells him that I ordered the first thing she brought out. Big Surprise. With my visible frustration, and the fact that I didn't make it through half my plate, the manager never offered to take the dish off my ticket and he knows how frequently my wife and I come here being that we live so close to the restaurant spending our hard earned money. Bottom line \"sorry\" does nothing for me, NO ONE should have to pay for an order that wasn't to their satisfaction... I won't be coming here AGAIN. 94 health score by the way shouldn't have been there in the first place.  Sincerely yours, unsatisfied customer. Rollie Boone",

Over the last year I have seen the food and service get tremendously better. The manager noticed I became a regular and has introduced himself and always asks how my experience is. Its great for a quick bite or to have a cocktail after a long day at their bar. The atmosphere is great if you like to sit at the bar, at a table inside, and they have outdoor, covered seating with televisions so it is great for summer as well!I love Mexican food, but the staff are what keep me coming back!!",

My son's toppings and refried beans came with the usual lettuce, guacamole and pico.  In addition, there was a still somewhat alive cockroach in his beans.  He fished it out and its legs and antennae were still moving around a little.  When I told the manager he did not believe us and said it must have \"flown\" in.  We don't think so.  It wasn't a flying type.     Other than that,  the service was indifferent, the soupy beans had hot dogs in them and the shrimp sauce was a watery mess.  Beware.",

She offered to speak to him again and he again said no because it's cinco de mayo.  He never came to the table to offer an apology. There were no signs saying Kids Eat free wasn't valid on cinco de Mayo.  Bad customer service.  Sneaky manager.

    "text": "Cabo's (formerly Salsas) is my favorite Mexican in town!  I've tried other \"Authentic Mexican\" spots and they were a little too authentic for my taste (i.e. greasy and bland).  Cabo's is consistent, fresh, flavorful, prompt and service is sufficient.  Now if you're a snooty, uppity person and need a lot of attention from your server, don't bother.  They will bring your DELICIOUS fresh salsa the minute you sit down and take your drink order.  They will return with your drinks and take your food order.  Literally 5-10 yummy-chips-and-salsa-minutes later, your food will arrive hot and on a HUGE plate.  Your drinks will be refilled as needed.  No frills.  Pretty much what you can expect at this price-point.  Something you won't expect from this price-point are the table-side guacamole option and fresh made tortillas-made in a tortilla bar at the front of the restaurant. Very nice touch for those of you looking for a more Cantina feel. We almost always go for lunch but I know they have a pretty happening nightlife on the weekends.    Tip: my favorite dish is the Pollo Con Queso.  Spanish rice topped with grilled-to-perfection (never over-grilled and charred) chicken, topped with grilled peppers, onions, and TOMATOES (yum) then all smothered with their perfect queso (never runny or watery).  Also with a side of standard guac and sour cream.  PERFECTION!  I get it every time and it is always good.",

The first, was a little disillusioned by the fact that they only brought 3 tortillas for for Fajitas (two of us splitting) and then charged $1 when I asked for one more.  This never happened when it was Salsa's. They either brought extra to begin with or happily brought another free of charge. Second time was ok.  We were the only patrons as it was early for lunch.  The workers were preparing for the crowd so the service was good. Food was ok. Third (and last?) time.  Just went a couple if days ago for lunch.  Service was slow even though there were only 5 or 6 tables seated.  The chips were old (one tasted like rancid oil-my guess is that it was left in the warmer bin.  Had to actually spit it out...yuck!)My enchilada came barely warm. Didn't eat most of it.  My daughter's food was ok.  Cabo's is just not consistently good to keep going.  Just ok every now and then is not good enough. Nothing special here that is going to keep me coming back",

Apple maps tried to get us lost on the way to Cabo's, but the Yelp reviews were so good that we persevered and found it.  It's on the side of the shopping center (left at Party City if you're following Siri's directions).  We have both been hungover all day and I was craving Mexican food.  I'm so glad we ended up at Cabo's.  The salsa is so good.  I want to swim in a bowl of the salsa.  I love salsa that has a present cilantro taste, a strong tomato flavor, and just a hint of spice.  Many other Mexican restaurants I've been to have subpar salsa...not Cabo's.  The BF ordered Fajitas Supreme.  He was pleasantly pleased with the amount of shrimp that came out.  It appeared to be a rather healthy serving of meat and a nice mountain of shredded cheese on top.  I ordered the Burrito Tequila.  There were a few bits of grisly chicken, but other than that it was fantastic.  The chipotle sauce added a lot of flavor to the mix.  We both agreed the rice was delicious.  We sat outside as the inside area was a little too noisy.  Some guy was playing guitar and signing, but he simply added to the cacophony of sounds more than anything.  Overall, still a solid 5.  I'm not often in this area, but Cabo's has made the short list of places we'll gladly return to next time we're here.",

It also came with a large portion of grilled veggies which needless to say, I never got around to eating because it was all too much to eat. It would have been plenty for two people, especially after indulging on the chips and salsa. This is a basic Mexican restaurant. The menu is very large with lots of options.

There were several people waiting to be seated when we got there so went to the bar to get a drink. $2 Bud Light Lime, $9.99 for a skinny margarita, and $5.99 for a Bob Marley, were the specials that night.   I got the Bob Marley which has 3 kinds of Malibu rum and is very colorful and tasty. I always appreciate non-beer specials :).   We were served chips and salsa at the bar until the hostess came over and told us our table was ready, which was maybe 15 minutes after we first arrived.   It didn't take long for us to place our orders and get our food. I got the Lomo Saltado which is steak, peppers, rice, and homemade potato wedges. I normally only order a cheese quesadilla at Mexican restaurants (a self proclaimed particular eater), but this meal is amazing.  I also get it knowing we will have leftovers for my husband to eat the next day because he loves it too.   My husband and his friend got the tequila burrito, which is very good but spicy, with 2 sides. My husband said he also loves the California burrito which is not spicy.   Even with the bar we were out in an hour and I felt we got an excellent service and good prices. This is definitely my favorite Mexican place in South Charlotte.",

We've always loved Salsa's, but always had two reservations about going there: 1. the bar area (where smoking was legal) was too close to a lot of seats, therefore you'd inhale smoke all night and 2. it got crowded fast on \"family\" nights.  We would usually just go for lunch to avoid the crowd.  Well, two thing happened: 1. North Carolina outlawed smoking in all restaurants and 2. Salsa's expanded!  They've added a fresh tortilla maker and a place for a live band.  We went last Friday night to see our friend's band play and it was the same great Salsa's food in a wonderful atmosphere.  There was still a wait for a table, showing that the place is even more popular now!  Menu recommendations:  Pork Carnitas - I challenge any one person to finish this.  My wife usually has 2-3 meals from it.  Any other fajita - all of them are great, but now add in the fresh tortilla experience and they are no longer \"just a fajita\".  Tacos al Carbon - a great hot sauce and the onion/cilantro combination make these tacos jump  Enchilada Suizas - when you're in the mood for enchiladas done differently with a tomatillo sauce and queso!  And, getting back to the live band, they had the volume of the band set perfectly.  You could clearly hear them, but you didn't have to shout to have a conversation at your table.",

I've tried a few different entrees and was pleased with them all, everything tastes fresh and nothing is overcooked! If I were basing this review only on food I'd rate 5 stars.  However, the server we had the last time we went was a jerk. He was very rude and disrespectful to a member of our party. The customer he was rude to, ordered in Spanish and the server seemed to have a huge problem with that. The server replied in Spanish and called him a few rude names over the course of our meal. All of us spoke a little bit of Spanish and knew very well what he said. If I could remember the servers name I'd be sure to tell you, so you could avoid him.  It's unfortunate the server left such a bad taste in our mouths because we normally really enjoy Cabos. I really think service is a huge part of a restaurant experience which is why this place gets 3 stars. If we ever go back I'll make sure to update my review.",

They have several pork, meat, and chicken dishes, fried fish, fried shrimp, french fries, rice pudding, pancakes, omlettes made to order, the list goes on.  The food is Fresh and Fantastic.",

On Saturday night's they  have live music and it makes for a fun dinner!  Two outside patio's are awesome for a fabulous outside night if you are in the mood!  One thing I also really appreciate is that the owner is always walking around the restaurant helping out with no hesitation and is always very friendly!  I would recommend Cabo's to anyone!!!",

    "text": "This is about your average Mexican restaurant.  One thing I need to recommend is that you do not get the Charro beans. .  In the description it says they are Pinto Beans with Chorizo and Sausage.  It is more of a soupy side of beans with hot dogs in it.  The other food there is great though.  They have lunch specials and they also have a few dishes from other Latin American countries.    I will definitely eat here again as it is right across the street from my work.  However, there is a lot of competition here in the Pineville area.",

Then when we finally got our order the food was very bland. Then it took another 20 minutes to receive my check , which I had to asked for. Regardless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant.",
