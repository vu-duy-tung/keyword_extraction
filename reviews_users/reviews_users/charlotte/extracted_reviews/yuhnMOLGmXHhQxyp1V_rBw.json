I would usually go here and get the 'endless' bowls, but on my last trip, they got rid of it and moved to small, medium, and large sized bowls. The pricing for what you get is also higher than it used to be. Before the switch to the sized bowls, I'd give it four stars. After all this, I would still recommend this place",

He said it costs money and my waitress should have told me that. I leave and begin to realize I could have paid for that glass and he should have asked. Also why was he so rude? I called the restaurant shortly after I left and was told they would let their employees know. No apology or explanation. Simply rude.",

The food score is mid ninety's, the hostess was very nice, seated us, and took our drink order quickly. The server came, holding a small stack of stainless bowls, greeted us and asked if we'd been in before. We said yes but it had been awhile; she said we just got a new menu and made some other changes; like the name card so when your bowl is cooked they can find you. I would have been fine with a standup number card to let them know where we were seated, but wait, what happened to standing there and waiting for the grill cook to hand it to you? Another change. Our very nice server then explained about the bowls. At first we thought the bowl was for only the meats/seafood section, but we were told no, it is for  that and all the veggies too. Oh no, I don't take much of the meats, but I love the veg and I feared the new bowl wouldn' be able to access all I chose, it didn't. The sauces were a little confusing to me and with short arms I had to reach to to get a few items. So, after you put what you can in the bowl a cook is waiting to take it from you and get your starch order because these items are no longer on the bar with the other food. Another change. I asked for steamed rice and it came mixed in with my stir fry ...it always came on the side...did not know you had to ask for it not to be mixed in, another change.  It seemed to be overpriced for what you get. We miss the original order of things and probably won' t make the long drive anytime soon.",

The place is loud - like the cafeteria in a night club loud.  Lots of hard surfaces, tall ceilings, loud tv or music - just noisy.    We didn't have to wait long for a table and was seated in the back.  The kitchen is open and there was a line what I assumed was a salad bar.  It wasn't.  The concept of this place is that you take your bowl, stand in line, and then fill it with as much raw stuff as you want.  Then you hand it over, someone else cooks it, and brings it to you.    For people who know what they want, you might like this...but why.  The concept of a restaurant is to have someone give you a menu of items, you choose what you want, and they prepare it for you.  This place requires a bit of imagination...imagination I don't have.  As a result, my meal was terrible.  No one to blame but myself since I chose the ingredients but if I want to screw up my dinner, I can eat at home.    I took my son hoping there would be something for him as well.  They have the requisite kids items (pizza etc) but he wanted to be like me so he grabbed his bowl and stood in line with me.  Raw meat looks gross - it just does - so he was unimpressed.  He ended up with some imitation crab and an egg in a bowl.  They scrambled his egg and give it back.    Nearly $40 for 3 people to eat and I have to make my own food and if I make it lousy, it's my own fault.  Yeah...no.",

After almost ANOTHER 35 MINUTES, we noticed the server and manager in a discussion after she told us she was getting our bowl. I caught the tail end, where he nonchalantly said, \"just apologize\". She came by and said that she had given our bowl to another customer!!   We've eaten at this chain in several cities. This experience has led us to NEVER go to this establishment again!! A BASIC tenet of chain restaurants is that the customer gets a consistent experience, wherever they may eat. As they are clearly unable to deliver on that promise, they have lost our business forever.  We discourage you from going to this restaurant!",

    "text": "Very good food! Staff super friendly and helpful. You go in and are seated at a table, handed and menu, waiter comes by asks for drink order, then asks if you know how the system works, if not they explain it all to you. Our waiter was nice, but we didn't see much of her.  It's a topping bar style, do-it-yourself, make your own stir fry place, however if your not in the mood to really think about putting a bowl together, you can pick from a menu. First you choose your meats (raw) and they have everything from chicken, to seafood, to beef, to turkey. Next choose your spices. Add veggies, and there is plenty of great variety and they are fresh, pick out a sauce (fyi Dragon sauce is awesome), then take it to the 'grill area' and pick out a starch. (The tofu was very good too!)  **TIP: Pile your bowl high, the veggies and meats reduce when they are cooked.   The food was very healthy, tasteful, full of flavor, and cooked very nicely. You can watch your food being cooked as well. Prices were a little high, however I would return because the food is quality. For a lunch bowl it was $7.99 and for dinner is was $9.99.    Side note, it was a VERY cold inside, might wanna bring a light jacket.",

I tried this one because i was in the area and too far from ballantyne. i was still pleased. i love the cafeteria style build your own plate thing. Its a new trend in restaurants. There are others like Mod pizza, etc with similar preparation structures. The best advice i was given from our server was \"be greedy, get as much as you want it will all be cooked and added to your bowl. And make sure you go overboard on veggies because those shrink down\". i LOVED HER. i put a heaping amount of veggies on my bowl and they fell all over my tray. i love the combination i created with the dragon sauce, ginger, lemon pepper and a few other things. I am so glad my date led me here. I may not see him again but i'm definitely building a relationship with this place lol!",

However...got food poisoning which started around 5am Saturday morning. Thought I should go to the hospital during one 2-hour stretch. I'll spare you the details. An elderly person would have had their life at risk. By late evening Saturday night I was through the worst of it and improving.  There is no doubt in my mind this illness came from my meal at this restaurant. My daughter did not get sick.  Unfortunately, I will not be patronizing again. This is the risk you take eating at an establishment that has raw meat laid out in reach of the public for long periods of time. In fact, I'm just going to scratch Mongolian BBQ in general off my list.",

We sat at the bar and they have a tv, with inexpensive wines including sake and a couple of beers on tap as well as bottled beer.  You are given a small bowl that you can heap up with various proteins and veggies of all sorts, some marinated, some not and you can choose a sauce to be cooked with it all.  There is a selections of dried spices and seasonings so you can make it to your taste and hot or not.  There are tasting spoons for you to try the sauces, but because there is a line behind you, you don't really get to taste them all 'cause you don't want to hold everyone up.    You get a choice of starch (noodles/rice etc...) to go with it and you can add an egg to it as well.  They take your bowl to be cooked on the flattop, and give you a number and bring it to the table when it's done.  I really like the taste of mine (beef tips, calamari, scallops w/chestnuts and mushrooms with a honey soy sauce), but I felt they went very light on the starch (udon noodles for me).  I felt like I would run out of noodles before I was half done with the rest of the dish.  I would probably go back, but not if I was really hungry.",

Employees were visiting with each other when they could have been cleaning to possibly prevent someone from falling from stepping in grease.  I asked if the noodles were made with buckwheat, since that's what udon noodles are supposed to be made with.  (I asked because some places use a combination of wheat & buckwheat flours to save money.). Our server didn't know, so she went & asked 2 other employees.  One didn't know & the other one had her tell us that they are made with buckwheat flour.  They weren't.  In fact, they were just regular wheat noodles in the shape of udon noodles - no buckwheat at all.   There was no shrimp, but fish in the bin labeled shrimp.",

We had to ask for refills and our bowls once our order was cooked and even hunt down a server and ask for our check. We overlooked the service since the food was so good. We decided to go back yesterday for lunch again. We will never go back. We had to wait for shrimp to be defrosted in order to make the bowls we wanted, the raw steak was brown and tasted funny to my son, veggies were empty and not being refilled, I had to ask the cook for sauce cups and once I got my bowl, it took 25 minutes before my husband's and son's were done and they ended up walking to the counter and getting them themselves. Then my husband's bowl was so burnt he had to start all over again just for them to burn the second one! I don't mean overcooked either I mean the meat was black and crispy. Why? Because half the time the cooks at the grill had their backs turned not even watching the food. They did comp his meal only after I asked and didn't want their free dessert. The poor people next to us tried ordering off the menu and they were out of everything. Once they did find something it was brought out completely wrong. Unless management changes we won't be back.",

Be sure to go heavy handed on any bowl size because the meal will be smaller than you thought once it's cooked.  At least your free item, will make the experience balance out.  I made my order based on a previous patron review.  It turnt out pretty good but I was missing my rice in my dish with noodles.  I got the peanut butter dessert as my freebie for joining the rewards program.  Once my meal was cooked and ready to go, the waitress informed me I would be given the other two dessert choices to complete the free item.  So once I got home, I ate my meal first and realizing my rice wasn't there.  After I ate, I open up three containers to see two desserts in one box, one in another, and there's my rice in the last box.  I felt like my initial meal was worth $6 but with the rice maybe $8.  The lemon raspberry cake and peanut butter cake were moist & delicious.  The Oreo was quite dry.  If I come back next time, I'll get more creative with added topping to such a small bowl.  YouTube gave me some building ideas.",

Everyone in that restaurant made sure that we had everything we needed (refilled drinks, sauce, and anything else). This was the best service we have had at a restaurant in so long! And the food was so yummy!! Do yourself a favor and go eat at this place. You won't be disappointed!",

Genghis Grill can get quite crowded sometimes,especially on a Saturday.I remember going one time and there was a wait.However,all the staff members seat and serve guests as fast as they can.There is a female and male manager and I would just like to commend them because every time I go in there they are working so hard and leading by example.Sometimes managers forget they have to get in and get dirty too,but these two definitely don't.Kuddos to you two!!",

First of all when you walk in it smells awful and the floor is clearly not kept up with there was dirt everywhere. My family and I ordered our drinks and food and just tried to enjoy ourselves. After getting our bowls to fill at the bar I went over to the meat bar first. At first glance everything looked fine. But when I stuck serving tongs in the steak bin the steak was all frozen in a big block. Next, the shrimp had an odd smell and color on it. We did not even get past the meat bar before leaving the restaurant. I will not visit this location again. I told my waiter about the steak and he did not really seem to care. We will not be back.",

We asked to take our refill bowl home because it took 40 minutes to get and we did not have time to sit there any longer, the serve informed us that we could not have a box because it was the unlimited box. I explained to her that I understood that this was the policy but that we had waited so long for our food that we could not wait any longer. The server then went to the manager and asked if we could have a box and explained to him the situation and he said no. I then asked to talk to the manager and when Chaz approached the table he was rude from the start. I again explained to him why I was asking for an exception and he stated that I was being \"confrontational\" and stormed off to get us a box. When he returned to the table I explained to him that I was not intending to come across that way, I was just explaining to him again what the server had just explained. He then accused me of trying to convince the servers to break the rules, rolled his eyes and stormed away from the table. Our server was very apologetic for her managers actions, but this does not make up for the managers actions.",

There's only one buffet line which makes more sense since the one in Ballantyne only has one at a time open anyway. I like this buffet line better tho because the grill is right at the end of it!! So there was no risk of lifting my tray and losing anything off top!! This location does not have cheese or sour cream though. And they burned my bowl!! All I tasted was the burned sauced scraped from the grill to my bowl. Will definitely not be returning to this location. Only positive thing was the setup.",

Perhaps it's all of the above now? The service was the worst. The food was (as usual) overpriced for what you get. It wasn't bad but I've had better stir fry at a Chinese take out. The floors are always sticky and the stations are sloppy. Won't come back to this particular location ever again.  Maybe the other locations are better",

    "text": "I will start by saying that I ate here with my daughter who has been here quite a few times and loves it. However, this was first visit and I would never go back if it weren't for my daughters positive comments about past experiences. We arrived for lunch shortly after opening and were the first patrons to be seated. A young man came to take our order and we both chose a frozen margarita. A couple of minutes later a woman came to our table to inform us alcohol was not available on Sunday before noon. We both chose a Coke product instead which was quickly served but completely flat. The server did a great job informing me of the options and bowl sizes so we ordered and were on our way to the buffet. Everything was fully stocked and nicely displayed. We approached the grill and were greeted promptly by a nice young man. We ordered our bases and went back to be seated. When our food was delivered I was shocked to see how charred it was! There were bits of chargrill stuck to the side of both of our bowls and unrecognizable burnt pieces that I picked out from the food. We managed to eat most of it without complaining. Our server had brought us drink refills and we were hopeful these would be carbonated but they were just as flat as the first ones. We then relaxed and talked while waiting for the bill. My daughter had placed her debit card on the table as a sign we were ready when the server came by and asked if there was anything else we needed, which we declined. We assumed our bill would appear promptly but it took several more minutes before she came by again to see if there was anything else we needed and we had to ask for it. Then after waiting several minutes again for her to come back I finally said let's go pay it at the bar. As we stood up and began walking up there the server appeared from around the corner and took it for us. It will take some sweet talking to get me to return here.",

    "text": "Today was my last visit to Ghengis Grill, which saddens me because I always looked forward to going.  The visit started out fine. We went in between lunch and dinner, hoping it would be less crowded since the line to pick your meats and vegetables tends to bog down during peak hours. It was surprisingly busy and we ended up waiting quite awhile for our food to cook. We didnt mind because we've always loved their food and knew it would be worth the wait.  Both of us ordered the bottomless bowl, which we always do. Mine arrived cooked perfectly; my husband's was burnt and he didn't eat it all. When asked if we'd like to make a second bowl, we said yes! The second bowls were both cooked to perfection, and were made much quicker, too. We ate what we could and then this is when everything went south.   I asked for two takeout boxes.   I was immediately informed that bottomless bowls were not able to be taken home. Mind you, there was a good portion left in each of our bowls. I told her that we'd taken home our leftovers at least half dozen times before and she said, \"Sorry, it's policy.\" I asked to speak to the manager.  The manager came out and said the staff has been \"retrained\" and that they never should've allowed us to take food away all those times in the first place. They would rather throw good food away...how wasteful. All she kept saying was \"No exceptions.\"  As a customer service manager myself, this is no way to treat your customer. Rules are not always black and white.  It's a shame that one horrible ending has tarnished what was once an enjoyable place to eat.",

It took 30 minutes to get seated and only slightly more than half the tables were occupied. Another 10-15 minutes to get our order taken (drinks and bowl size). Then we got to the bar where you fill your bowl. It was absolutely DISGUSTING. Food was cross-contaminated - spilled all over the counter. The sauces were spilled all over and about a third of them were empty. I really wanted to leave right then, but we stayed anyway. Our food was (thankfully) fully cooked, and it tasted good (of course, we chose all our own ingredients, so it SHOULD). But my wife and I decided we will NEVER return to this restaurant chain. It's so simple - keep the food at the bar fresh, and tidy and the customers do the rest, mostly. They can't even do that! Sad! Oh! And the entire experience took 2.5 hours from the time we walked in to the time we left. Service was so SLOOOOOW!!!",

We were seated quickly and got our drinks.  The waiter was friendly and personable.  We went through the line, assembling our bowls and handed them off to the cook table.  About 25 minutes later, one of out 2 bowls comes to the table.  I think that it was mine... it had the rice I requested and something that might have been the beef I put in the bottom of my bowl before it was turned to charcoal.  Really.... it was black!  There wasn't even a hint of a vegetable (2/3 of what I handed over).  We flagged down the server and were questioning what happened when what we assumed was my wife's dish came to the table.  It had the pasta she requested, topped by what I could best describe as burnt dog kibble dropped at the table.  I saw the all vegetable / fruit items that she chose and I can't figure out how they took that input and created whatever was delivered to our table.  What is even more amazing was that someone scraped this off of the grill, put it on a starch and SERVED it!  No apology.  No \"please reassemble a bowl and we will make it right.\"  They sent it to the table and looked surprised that we weren't thrilled!",

    "text": "I visited this restaurant with some friends years ago, and I remember enjoying it immensely.  However, since I live nearly 45 minutes away from this restaurant, I almost forgot about it altogether.  Only because of some errands scheduled on that part of town (Independence Boulevard), I decided to give Genghis another try.  As before, I enjoyed the near-novelty aspect of \"Build Your Bowl\" Stir Fry format...with the freedom to choose exactly the meat/meats, veggies and sauces that you wanted.  Also, the food was quickly prepared, once we handed over our bowls to the seemingly amateur team of T-shirt clad chefs (?) circling the grill.  As fun and/or interesting as it may be...of building your bowl by going through the line, handing over the bowl to the grill-side chefs, then heading back to the table to wait, it all felt a bit too casual and unsanitary.  It also felt a bit too hectic...and not very relaxing in terms of dining.  That aside, the stir-fried bowls were delivered to our table quickly, piping hot...and overall, quite satisfying!  In this particular occasion, however, I added too many varieties of sauce to my bowl, so the spiciness was a bit over the top.  Since I designed this meal myself, I've got nobody else to blame!  No matter, I did enjoy the entire experience...and will most definitely do it again.  Although the location was an issue, I discovered that there is now a Genghis Grill branch closer to me (Ballantyne location)...so that's where I'll be heading next.  Given that branch is newer, it may feel a bit more sanitary?",

The manager said they'd  refund the money but I never got the refund. My son loves it here and his birthday was yesterday so we went back. That is honestly the very last time I'll ever go to this location - the people cooking just stand around and the waiters/waitresses are so inexperienced. Couldn't even get the apps to come out before the dinner and there was a good 10-15 min between bowls being delivered. When we left the manager Manny was outside smoking and laughing with a few other workers. Stay away from this location - it's just not worth the frustration that you experience, not to mention the lies they tell you.",

I love the idea of putting what I want in my food and making it taste how I want it to. It's all fresh and a lot  of it. I just wish the prep bowls were a little bigger. For ten dollars per person it's a little challenging to put it all in these bowls. Otherwise good food.",
