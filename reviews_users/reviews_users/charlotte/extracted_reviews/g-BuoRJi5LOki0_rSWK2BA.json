The portions were minuscule for the price. $12 for French toast isn't crazy, but it's laughable when the food comes and it's 1 piece of sandwich bread. I repeat 1. I've felt more satisfied on a juice cleanse. Save your money and go next door to bang bang burgers. Their burgers are awesome. You won't be disappointed.",

There were some loud people where we were sat so we asked to me moved to a more quiet booth. The host graciously led us to a very comfortable booth. The bartender and everyone who came to our table was very knowledgeable and super friendly. The food was AMAZING- we had the ricotta gnocchi, scallops, wagyu tartare, seasonal asparagus and to top it off, the Krispy Kreme bread pudding YUM. Needless to say we had a great experience and I will be returning!!",

We ordered a lot of stuff:  Petite Wedge: absolutely delicious Roasted & Glazed Carrots: My absolute favorite thing of the night and I don't even eat carrots Main Lobster & Avocado Toast: This was kind of not good to me. It tasted like key limes and was sweet and just not what I expected. American Wagyu Tartare: My other favorite thing, it was so good and flavorfull Charcuterie: Delicious!  Our waitress was also amazing and extremely knowledgeable. She asked for feedback at the end and accepted it with grace. I definitely will be returning!",

Many times the server would come to the door but not even come outside and check on us. Took 30 min after being seated to even get a drink. Thought maybe it was packed inside which could explain the poor service, but plenty of open tables there, too. Overall very dissatisfied and wouldn't recommend unless you are in no hurry whatsoever.",

The menu is chef driven and always changing, curated by one of the most passionate chefs in Charlotte, Vince Giancarlo.    The bar is mesmerizing, I especially love the silent movies they play on the TVs, it really keeps the environment classy and interesting and the cocktails are innovative and unique.  Their bar is endless, the most cordials and mixers I have ever seen in one place. The bartenders Ryan and Shane made me all sorts of interesting cocktails and every one of them was excellent.   Being a bartender myself, I appreciate the craft and the technique that goes into every cocktail and Zeppelin prides themselves in following through with those expectations.   All in all, this is one of my new favorite places to hang out and will keep coming back for more !",

First, the restaurant itself is very well designed and has a great ambiance.  It is clear much thought and effort went into design of building menus.   Overall the service was not good at all.  It was slow and simply not good.  Most were very friendly, just lacked proper training and/or competence.   The menu was a bit limited due to how new the restaurant is however there were some highlights from what we ate.  The calamari and duck are exceptional.  Will definitely order both again.   We were caught off guard quite a bit by the attitude of one of the bartenders.  While we respect the fact that he created the drink menu, he was quite condescending and frankly rude.  Not an ideal way to endear yourself and your new restaurant to locals who dine out every weekend.    I expect that the rough spots from our experience were due to the fact that the restaurant was just opened.  Hopefully they will address the service issues and round out the menu as expected.    If so, it will be a welcomed addition to the southend dining scene.",

I am a music fan and enjoy many different genres however I draw the line when it becomes culturally insensitive . I was and still am highly offended when I'm trying to enjoy myself and I hear a song playing very loudly that is clearly using the n-word. At first I thought it was a mistake but noticed as time went on that the unedited versions were playing and the n-word was as played several times. I brought this the the managers attention and was basically told the owner has received this complaint several times, likes to play his preferred music and that my concern would be conveyed again. Translation is the owner doesn't cater to people like me, doesn't care about offending others and to basically get over it. So I will actively choose to spend my money where there is an understanding of cultural competence and sensitivity and tell anyone who asks to not patronize this place.",

We ordered our drinks, which were delicious.  The menu is small and most dishes are served tapas style and serve 2-3 people each. We ordered a total of about 4 small plates and 3 big plates and a dessert which I was too full to try.   The notorious P.I.G and calamari were delicious!  The lamb ribs were tender and perfectly seasoned.  The fried green tomatoes and burrata were surprisingly refreshing and equally good. I wasn't too fond of the waygu beef tartare. Although the presentation and favors were on point, the way the meat was presented, visually, turned me off. I was expecting finely chopped beef but my plate had ground raw beef on it like it just came out of a meat grinder.  And the truffle yolk was not aesthetically pleasing to me. But I have to admit, eyes closed, the flavors were good. The beef was very well seasoned and the components of the dish worked well with the beef.   I especially liked that with each dish that came out of the kitchen the server gave a tantalizing description of each dish. I felt like I was at top chef!  All in all it was a pleasant experience and I would definitely come back.",

However I do like the outdoor set up (lots of loungers/couches). The burger place next door has picnic tables with umbrellas. I'm sure duing the summer this will be a great hangout spot.  The restaurant is really quaint. not as large as it appears online but really cute. The food is served Tapas style which I wasn't all for...until I actually ate. OMG!!! The food here is THE BOMB!!!! As a table, we decided to just order a few small plates and share (that was our servers suggestion). We ordered the scratch buns, kettle fried chicken, hush puppies,scallops, and Rictota Gnocchi. In my opinion ALL the food was good. However as a group we felt the Notorious P.I.G. puppies, Fried Chicken and Scallops were our favorite! The food is very well seasoned! Definitely order just a few items for a group. You can always decide later if you want more, and the food comes out pretty quick (which makes sense since the menu is so limited).   To drink I ordered the Paloma De La Parrilla. It was good. A little too bitter for my taste but I did ask for something not sweet and this was the recommendation. It has salt on the outside of the glass which is cool. I would have preferred sugar. I will probably order it again and get the sugar on the outside instead. I only needed one drink as that 1 did the trick! Everyone agreed the drinks were great!  Our server was really sweet and offered great suggestions on how the food should come out.  This place gets 5 stars not just because the food was good but because the music was ON POINT!!! They seemed to play mostly hip hop and R&B which I LOVED. It was mostly 90s and 00's music and I was jamming the whole night! I also appreciated the restaurant wasn't super packed and the music wasn't too loud. It was just right. There's a parking lot they share with the burger place that I was able to park in. There is off street parking as well.  I DEFINITELY will be returning to Zepplin. I can't wait to have another girls night or even bring my husband back.",

    "text": "A casual restaurant, with a not so casual menu. The service is friendly and very professional. I had the pleasure of having the head bartender, Ryan, to tend to my table. Ryan suggested some cocktails and they were absolutely delicious! Quit dragon my heart and French 75, definitely recommend both. Dragon is smooth and sweet while the French 75 is very citrusy, crisp and refreshing. That said, I think French 75 was my favorite, most drinks topped off with prosecco, are usually good in my book. The menu is meant to be shared but in no way like many other restaurants where they are barely sharable. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Tartar and the Point Judith Calamari, both dishes were enjoyable. The only thing that threw me off was the Tartare, the togarshi rice crackers flavors compete way too much with the tuna.  I liked the contrast of the compressed melon, cucumber and almost preferred the tartare with the cucumber alone. I am looking forward to returning so that I can try more items! Great job Zeppelin team!",

    "text": "Really digging this spot. The first time, I went in the evening after the sun had gone down. The ambiance and vibe was pretty chill. Sitting at the bar felt very lounge-y which is the kick I've been on lately. Yesterday I went because I remembered there was a nice patio out front and I wanted to enjoy the beautiful weather. Although we ended up sitting at the bar the entire time, it was still awesome. The hosting staff is so friendly and welcoming as soon as you walk in. A bar staff member approached us and dropped some waters off while we waited for the bartenders to finish up their current tasks. From there we were so impressed. Not only did they answer any questions we had about the menu items, they recommended things and told us about other recipes we hadn't brought up. These guys really knew what they were doing. The entire cocktail making process was such a presentation and show. It was as if these guys were chefs and every detail truly mattered to them. From the way they shook the shakers to how they cut a lemon peel into a perfect rectangle. The cocktail I got was on the lighter side and was made with a melon vodka and topped with egg whites and an edible flower. My boyfriend got the old fashioned. It was presented in a smoke filled cake cover and was nothing short of perfect. If you happen to wonder what the \"Waygu fat washed bourbon\" is, then the bartenders will reply with the following explanation: the restaurant serves a waygu tartare and the extra fat trimmings are set aside to mix with the bourbon. The fat is melted down and added to sit for about an hour and a half. After this, the mixture is frozen for about two hours and when the fat has separated from the liquor, it is skimmed off the top. What is left is a rich taste of waygu beef in a nice brown bourbon. What an awesome technique that truly adds so much to an otherwise typical recipe.  A friend joined us and ordered dinner which looked awesome as well. I picked one of the two deserts they offer which was the bread pudding garnished with lemon ice cream. Omg! So good. I even got my chocolate loving boyfriend to try it and enjoy it. I got a cold brew coffee to pair with it and wake me up from my food coma. I was honestly just so impressed with the bartender's knowledge and service that I probably wouldn't even have noticed if the rest of the place sucked. Good thing it didn't and all in all this place is a 6 out of 5 stars.",

I'll start with the atmosphere which is pretty cool given the eclectic 90s throwback playlist... I love the bare wood roof ceilings... the place is cozy without being TOO small, but I'd suggest coming early (RIGHT after work, as it seems to fill up fast!!) For my drink, I felt I just had to have the Edison... an Old Fashioned brought on a tray, covered in a bell jar filled with wood smoke... it was a lovely drink to look at, and even better to enjoy sipping on the smoky classic with the treat of a liquor soaked cherry at the end!   We split a tray with duck prosciutto (which melted in my mouth), Spanish chorizo, cheddar, goat cheese, triple cream brie, and the fog bleu... served with little blintz pancakes, whole grain mustard, and house made pickles... the ONLY thing that could've made this tray better would be to have had some sort of crackers at the ready as there were not enough vehicles for the cheese/meat in the mini blintzes... They did bring us some chips, which was very helpful!! All of these were served to us by a waiter named Tony who was as friendly as he was knowledgeable about the menu!    All in all, we REALLY enjoyed our visit, and I'm looking forward to coming back soon!!",

I was hoping it would not be a pretentious cocktail bar with mediocre food like some of the other new places popping up in Charlotte. It certainly was not any of that, Zepplin is tiny little gem in Southend. Awesome patio and very comfortable restaurant inside with cool decor. Not very big so I could see coming here on the weekends being a challenge, I'd try to make a reservation if they take them. We went on a Monday and it was still pretty busy.... all for good obvious reasons! The cocktails are interesting and delicious. If you like gin, try the giggle water. It was very refreshing and was not to sweet or spicy. Service was top notch! Our server was fantastic and very attentive. The food menu has many great offerings whether you are in the mood for tapas style or entrees. We decided to share a couple dishes between the three of which was perfect. The butternut squash hummus is amazing, seriously delicious and served with honey, olive oil, squash, and pesto. This combination of what sounds random was absolutely fantastic! All served w freshly toasted bread. The lobster Mac and cheese was on point, it was creamy and served with linguini. I really enjoyed how it was a good balance of cheese and a light cream sauce, wasn't heavy at all.  Check this place out! You will not be disappointed!!",

    "text": "Was really excited to try Zeppelin but after my Sunday brunch experience it would be difficult to recommend.   Made a reservation for 8, for 12:15pm. Like most people, my friends and I looked at the drink/food menus beforehand and saw they offered Aperol Spritz pitchers, we attempted to order those but were told they don't offer them anymore. No worries, places change menus often. When it was time to order food, 4 of the 8 of us ordered some type of Scratch Bun, a staple on their menu. Ten minutes later, our waitress came back to tell us they only had one bun left...they open at 11 so just assumed there was some ill planning there. For those who ordered the fried chicken bun, our waitress was offering another chicken entree that was $7 more but would not honor the price of the bun we ordered when asked if they could accommodate us due to half of our party having to re-order. Once new orders were figured out, we all received our food very piece mailed and delayed. Two people ended up not eating at all.  I was appreciative of the manager coming over to apologize and letting us know he would adjust our bills accordingly. Unfortunately that was overshadowed by our waitress letting us know he discounted our bills incorrectly and she was now having trouble dividing everything up. Something we as the customers should be the sounding board for.   The couple bright spots were the that the food was very good once we received it. And the mimosas were delicious as they're champagne forward - which was needed after our experience at Zeppelin.",

Well, if you consider waiting 3 1/2 hrs ok for food , or being served sub par food ok, or perhaps waiting  too long for the check to arrive .. or the horrible \"no wait\" app that drastically under calculates wait time .. or maybe even having the manager sitting down at the bar and drinking before all customers have left for the night ok ... then you might like this place.  From what I found out , 2/3 owners have no previous restaurant experience.  The manager on duty supposedly had 15 years of fine dining experience , yet she looked no older than 30.  She was not apologetic now did she stay around to field any questions or concerns .. she spent most of the 3 hours I was waiting, standing at the back of the restaurant while the poor hostess had to deal with all the onslaught from waiting customers..  although we did get 2 free apps... which again , I thought were ok.   It's sad to me to see all these new and exciting places popping up around south end and all of Charlotte , but with sub par food and service .. especially coming from the service industry and doing my time in customer relations.  Communication and feedback are key !  To say I will NOT being going back to this place is an understatement !",

    "text": "I've enjoyed two meals here already and really had a great time, but jeez wait times are crazy!  The location is great, nestle right in South End by the design center. There is plenty of street parking and a small lot nearby. The restaurants interior is really cool, but it's pretty small. They have a little bit of outdoor seating.   The drinks are good and displayed beautifully. I ordered the Fogle Fizz, it was slightly too sweet for me - I'm pretty sensitive to sweet drinks though. My friend ordered the Edison - it has quite the presence! It comes in a smoke filled glass dome that they artfully lift when set at the table.We ordered specialty drink when we went for Valentines day. I can't remember what they were, but they were actually very good.  We've had the roasted and glazed carrots, Maine lobster and avocado toast, Point Judith calamari, Maine lobster mac and cheese, and the buttermilk fried chicken. The standout is by far the carrots!!! They come with a whipped ricotta. As it is with most tapas restaurants, each tapa was between $9-$20 (this is a little steep, but the portions are a little larger than normal). They have larger plates for about $18-$35 (again, they were larger plates, but still a little on the expensive side).  The service was quick. The waiter explained each dish and answered all questions.   The wait however, was out of control. Using the no wait app barely helps here. We used no wait Valentine's day weekend and waited for almost 2 hours. It was kind of ridiculous. The first time I came here we came at 5:15pm and we had no wait and were seated immediately.   I suggest you come here for a drink or two and maybe 2-3 tapas and then head out somewhere else for a larger meal!",

The Edison was tasty. Served under smoke filled glass.  4 of us shared 5 small plates and it was plenty. Everything was good. Loved the citrus lobster avocado toast. The calamari with sweet chili oil was the perfect last dish. Almost liked dessert.   Service was excellent. Everyone knew the menu and the details and you will want the details because you will forget all the info and not realize where all the flavors are coming from.",

Table of 6 was sat pretty quickly after we called and were told in a very valley girl accent that they were \"like......10 deep.\"  Our server was great. I've seen reviews about bad service, but ours was really attentive.   Great old fashioned drinks there. Highly suggest.  Here's where the yelp reviews are True:  Avocado toast is SUPER lemony. Overpowering to the whole dish.  Lobster Mac and cheese is fettuccini (which is accurately presented on the menu.ot macaroni, which let's be honest...is what we're all looking for. The lobster Mac and cheese at Namastay Kitchen is better. Seriously.   Biggest charcuterie board only comes with 5 tiny pancakes to use with the cheese. We had to ask for extra.   And speaking of the charcuterie board, I've seen complaints about things on their website menu being a different price when you get to the restaurant. This is absolutely True. The full blown charcuterie board online was $36, and when we got there it was $50. $50 FOR A CHARCUTERIE BOARD? I'm sorry...I'm not sure you got that. It was $50! I'd love those margins if I were Zeppelin.   My advice is go grab a drink and a snack, and leave. Immediately.",

I love Old fashions and they have a special one called the Uncle Eddy that I highly recommend. It has a strong ginger flavor but you can still feel the bourbon in it. I love that they serve it with king cube and cold smoke that gives it a personal touch.   I still haven't been able to try the full menu, but the food for thought, if your going for late night tapas and drinks are a must. There are like 5 or 6 items and we ordered all of them and they were all presented spectacular and so yummy.   I would recommend for you to try the notorious pig puppies and the lamb rumba. These two are a must. My mouth is watering just by writing this.   I had seen on Instagram they did a cocktail with a Z for zeppelin on it, but they don't do it anymore. I hope one day when I'm back I will be able to try that cocktail since it looks so appealing to me.   Go check out zeppelin you won't regret it.",

Needless to say they were good. If you have a wide palate for alcohol, you will definitely find what you're looking for here. We grabbed calamari and avocado toast to much on. The avocado toast was very pretty yet the bread was a little sweet for my liking. However, between the bread, lobster, and avocado spread, you will experience a lot of flavor. The calamari stole the show. You must try! I will be back again!",

So I used the app to \"get in line\" and walked in to make sure we were in fact, in line. To my surprise the parking lot was pretty damn empty. Walked inside and it was not packed at all. The hostess asked if we wanted to be seated now, which is just a weird question. Of course I want to be seated now?   Anyway, we got the table and the service was just okay. The cocktails can be talked up all they want, but they aren't really anything amazing. Their version of an old fashioned is $16 and last I checked this is CLT, not Upper Manhattan. The charcuterie board was mediocre at best. Meat, cheese, and mini pancakes with a microscopic dollop of mustard and 3 slices of homemade pickles. Absolutely not worth $32 (these margins are ridiculous).  The vibe and interior are pretty cool, but aside from that I would say go to Davidson Street Public House or an equivalent, for good food and good drinks at reasonable prices.  3/5...decent craft cocktails, interesting food menu, but unnecessarily expensive. Also, some of the more administrative-type kinks need to be worked out.",

Every single item that we ordered tonight (from the calamari, to the scallops, to the surprisingly amazing and thought-provoking lamb) had been just perfect.  The staffs recommendations have been on point as usual, and the culinary and cocktail fanfare have been among the CLT food scene elite. I seriously can't recommend this place enough, and their recent accolades online are well-deserved. Kudos to Chef, Ryan, and the whole Zeppelin team...you all are pouring your hearts into this venture, and it shows!",

First small plate was the avocado toast. The avocado smear on the excellent brioche slice was unbelievably good. It was the ultimate avocado.  Second plate was the Wagyu tartare and it was heavenly. The wagyu was a melt in your mouth flavor. This dish is worth a visit if you try nothing else on the menu.  Third up was the nightly pasta special. For us it was a charred scallion pasta in a parmesean small neck clam sauce. The pasta was incredibly delicious and the sauce was potently  delicious.  Then we had the Notorious P.I.G. puppies. The bbq that accompanied the hush puppies was succulent and flavorful. The whipper honey butter was a good pairing to the hush puppies. The hush puppies were a smidge dry unfortunately.   For dessert we had the chocolate stout cake. The cake was very rich and had great flavor but was slightly dry. The Biscoff ice cream was amazing.  Definitely worth a visit.",

Octopus was good but overpriced and the scratch buns were decent. Nothing to write home about. I was excited to check this place out but was really disappointed. Drinks were good and Dana our waitress was the only saving grace. not sure what the managers name is but she was completely unprofessional and has a lot to learn. I conveyed to our waitress that our scallops were undercooked and a bit mushy inside. I guess she relayed that to the young female manager with the tattoos and she came over with an attitude. I promptly told her the scallops were undercooked and that they weren't the best. My girlfriend is also pregnant which was another reason why I brought it to her attention. Not to mention I've read other reviews on here after our experience and I'm not the first to complain about the undercooked underwhelming scallops. She proceeds to completely disregard my concern and tell me that they weren't undercooked and pretty much tell me I didn't know what I was talking about. I show her only one side of the scallop was seared as the bottom was completely white and the inside was a wet mushy gelatinous mess. She yet again undermines what I had clearly pointed out and with a rbf says she'll take care of it and take it off the bill. As my girlfriend and I were still hungry we ordered the fried chicken which was $28 (absurd) but I had read reviews about how good it was so I went for it. Dana then comes over shortly after and explains there was a medical emergency in the kitchen and that the kitchen would be closed down for an unknown period of time. I say no problem I'll take the check. Check comes, scallops are still on there. I mention it to Dana she comes back after talking to the manager who clearly said she would take care of it and to my surprise she only discounted the $22 scallops half off. I mention it to Dana and she says she can't really do anything about it and even mentioned how sorry she was and that she has to deal with the young unprofessional manager a lot. She apologized and I paid the tab. I then walk over to the manager and bring up the bill and she gets completely defensive and has the gall to tell me she took the fried chicken off the bill and discounted the scallops half off! This is where I wanted to laugh out loud. She had the audacity to tell me she \"took care\" of the fried chicken and removed it from the bill. You mean the fried chicken we never got??? Am I tripping here? Like come on. She literally said this to me with a straight face as if she did me a favor removing the chicken off the bill. I then tell her she was young and had a lot to learn and if you tell a guest that you'll take care of something as a manager that's what you should do! Plus arguing with guests over a legitimate concern isn't a good look. Overall crappy experience especially with the shitty customer service by the manager and overpriced subpar food. I'd save my time and money if I were you and go somewhere else.",

Two minutes later he comes back with the same glass, same amount of foam...  just filled to the brim (if you enjoy a great gin fizz, you can already guess that the bartender just topped off the glass with soda water.  I opted for a glass of Rose and told the waiter to just give up on the gin fizz. 10 minutes later he returns with another attempt and a gin fizz.

Atmosphere:  I get going with a hipster retro vibe, but both times I've entered this place, there's no vibrancy, there's no excitement, it just gives off a depressing vibe, especially when you hear the bustling noises of the restaurants next door.   We had dinner here on a weeknight, chose to sit outside on the patio since the weather was nice. Our waitress was nice but aloof, we saw her a few times but were primarily taken care of by food runners.   #1 pet peeve: order a drink and it takes so long to come out that you're already eating. My wife and I each ordered a cocktail, and we were already done with our first course before they came out. On a half priced wine bottle night, literally the only tables near us (and in the whole establishment) were outside and all of them had wine, so I don't understand the ridiculous wait time.   The food was described by our waitress and in the menu brilliantly, but the execution was lackluster at best. The yellowtail was given to use and the tartare \"sauce\" at the bottom was mushy, slimy, and inedible. The ricotta gnocchi was the saving grace, pillowy pasta with a nice crust and a decent sauce and 2 trumpet mushroom pieces. The fried chicken was the biggest disappointment. For $28 if you're going to over promise with an elaborate description, you better deliver, and it did not. The coating on the chicken fell right off, so you couldn't get it in a bite with the meat, the corn and spoon bread were both charred to a crisp and both tasted only of that char and nothing else. The pickled mango slices on top were so over-cured that, on taking a bite, it felt like someone stabbed my tongue with a taser. Habanero vinaigrette? Saw a couple drops on the plate, didn't taste it. Overall, my impression was over promising and under delivering in execution of food drinks and service. Sometimes less is more.",

This isn't a problem for most people, but for those with dietary restrictions, it might be. It's not the most vegetarian-friendly place in the Queen City, but there are definitely options.

    "text": "My hubby and I finally had the opportunity to check out Zeppelin Friday night. We knew we were just gonna get a drink and an app so we ordered at the bar and brought it outside to the couches.  I ordered the Paloma, which was very unique and delish. My husband ordered a drink with coffee and whisky in it. Sounded super weird but came together nicely.   For food we ordered the PIG Hushpuppies. Easily the best hushpuppes I have ever had and the balance with the pork was perfection. I would go back just to have these.   My only two complaints were that 1. the drink prices are a tad bit higher than the Uptown Charlotte average. 2. The Hip Hop music did not match the scene at all and was a bit off putting. I don't particularly love hearing loads of profanity in music while out on a date. Otherwise, great night out, food, and service!",

    "text": "Ideally, I would give this place 3.5 stars. The menu is filled with unique dishes such as butternut squash hummus, coal roasted cabbage and lobster avocado toast and has a strong focus on locally sourced ingredients. However, there's a certain \"je ne sais quois\" that is lacking. The \"smalls\" dishes are in the price range of $8-20 and are meant for sharing. My table ordered the following:  - Peppadew rellenos ($9)- tasty but nothing special  - Charcuterie plate (with all the options- $35)- highly recommend, great assortment of meats (e.g. duck prosciutto) and cheeses - Maine lobster mac & cheese ($20)- this dish used fettuccine noodles and was trying to be too gourmet- flavors did not go well together - prefer classic mac n' cheese topped with lobster  - Pacific yellowtail crudo ($16)- four thin slices of tuna (no flavor), paired with bland crispy rice cakes and plated on top of a sriracha type sauce   I really wanted to love Zeppelin's but some things need to change before I give it a second chance.",

One of the girls in the party has a gluten allergy and he did a great job explaining what she could order from the menu. He was attentive enough without being overbearing. The food was okay. I ordered the bbq eggs benedit without the barbecue... unfortunately it came to the table with the barbecue on it. However they brought me a new one very quickly. But it was just okay. A few of the girls ordered frittatas that looked dry and they verified that they were. The others ordered shrimp and grits and one of the 'buns' options. They both enjoyed their dishes. I ordered two aperol spritzs' for cocktails. They were good, nothing out of this world though.  The food runner was also a bit sassy with me when I said that my dish was not right. She said that the server thought I meant no bbq sauce (which was kind of weird to already have a reason ready or so that is how it seemed). I said nope, no barbecue. The server did come and apologize for the mix up. This place is also pretty expensive for what you get in my opinion. It would have been nice if they had a cocktail option that was in the $6-$7 for brunch.",

    "text": "I am only rating off of our experience at the bar. We did not eat.  Went in late on a Saturday night and sat at the bar. The place wasn't very full. The first thing we noticed was how loud it was. They play the music loudly and even though it wasn't full it felt very loud. We wonder what it sounds like when it is busy. Not the best Ambiance because of this. Doesn't seem to match the look. We kept saying they needed to add some panels to help absorb the sound. I do like the look of the restaurant, however.  We sat at the bar and didn't have the best experience. We didn't even get greeted when we sat at the bar and the bartender was only a step or two from us. It was not busy and there were three bartenders. We simply had a menu slid towards us. Once the bartender did take our order, he did not ask us if we had any questions or help explain the drinks. He walked over and simply looked at us. It honestly felt like we were bothering him.   I ordered a Manhattan and my husband ordered the Edison. I know it's gimmicky, but I love the taste of smoky drinks. The presentation of the Edison is beautiful. The Manhattan was solid and small. The Edison was good, but was not near as great as I wanted it to be. I have had better smoky drinks in town.   My last concern with this place is the prices. Not all of us are on a banker's salary. The Manhattan was $15! Not even a specialty version. The Edison was $16. Ouch ouch ouch. If things are going to cost this much they have to be great, and these were just not worth it and neither was the experience. I recently had a bartender make me a custom smoked version of an old fashioned from scratch for $10, so this feels absurd.  We live within walking distance of this place, so I was very disappointed. I will likely not return. I understand they are a restaurant and not a bar, but I'm hesitant to return and try the food because of the above experience. A kind, engaged bartender would've likely changed our entire experience.",

Everything was outstanding.  Our friendly bartender Shane(who I recognized from Soul) made us all some amazing drinks.  The uncle Eddy is a perfect hand crafted cocktail.  Waygu fat washed bourbon with a cold smoke on it, quite a beautiful presentation as well.  After that I didn't really pay attention to what everybody else was drinking, but I heard no complaints.  On to the food.  We ate A LOT of it, lol.  One dish that really stood out was the waygu beef tartar with truffle egg.  The truffle egg was a little pungent for my taste, as the beef was amazing on its own.  The perfect little chips for dipping topped it off nicely.  The diver scallops were above and beyond as well.  Perfectly cooked.  I was hesitant about the bread crumbs, but they worked.  The celery root puree was a nice touch.  Everything else we had was superb, I just thought those 2 dishes were noteworthy.  The chicken was super juicy, brined, but not overkill on the spices in the brine.  The Burrata on the fried green tomato caprese was extremely tasty.  The calamari was on point, the pork bun was great and the yellowtail crudo was delicious, too.  One of the better meals I have had in Charlotte in some time.  Don't hesitate to ask questions.  There are some terms on the menu that may not be relatable, but the staff is quite knowledgeable.  Also, some older folks might not like the modern music, but I don't see it being a deal breaker.    I'll be back, again and again.",

I've been meaning to visit Zeppelin for a while but hadn't had a chance. We arrived an hour before closing on a Wednesday, so there was plenty of seating area. Since we were only going for a couple of drinks, we opted for the bar.  The place is decorated very nicely with a mixture of rustic and contemporary flairs. The lighting and ambiance was perfect for a quiet little date and the entire place impeccably clean.  Our first two cocktails were a Van Helsing for her, and a Paloma de la Parrila for me. Both were impeccable and not shy on the booze. Our second choices were a Sazerac for me and a Corpse Reviver # for her. Again, both delicious and well made.  The bartender was knowledgeable and talked us through a lot of the drinks and processes while we were there. All in all, it was a very pleasant backdrop for our date and we definitely plan to go back to try the food and more cocktails.",

We all shared small plates and had lots of cocktails, some of the specialty cocktails too.   All were just awesome. Order the calamari first, then whatever you want (it is all wonderful) but finish with the chicken; what a great comfort dish.   The scallops, the skirt steak, and the calamari were all 5-star dishes, but the chicken had that 6th star of making you feel like \"home\".

    "text": "After reading some other reviews I was worried about the noise level but the music was not too loud on Saturday at 7pm and no profanity laced rap.  It was a nice, mellow hip-hop vibe.  At 8:15 on the dot they turned the lights down and the music up so it probably gets much louder later.  The booth seating is the best but it's reserved for larger groups.  Sitting along the wall is nice but the chairs are a little hard seated.  They ran out of the necessary liquors for two of the specialty drinks as we sat there.  But I suppose that's better than faking it with other ingredients.  They offer chopsticks but the food isn't really designed to be eaten with chopsticks.  The citrus on the crudo is in supremes (slices) so you don't get it in your first bite if you go straight for the fish.  It's designed to be shoveled together with a fork.  So it's three large bites.  The skirt steak is a little chewy and could use a dash more salt or a harder sear.  Definitely knife and fork food as you want to cut it into smaller pieces to be able to eat and talk.  The egg pasta special is basically yakisoba.  But there's butter in it so beware fellow non-dairy diners.  Personally I find tossing butter into otherwise standard Eastern dishes offensive but I don't have to order it again.  Enjoy the atmosphere and drinks here for sure!  And it's a short walk to Jeni's Ice Cream for dessert if it's nice out.",

So prefect on what was a very hot Saturday night.  Then we got the roasted octopus. Honestly I love octopus but this was one of my favorite versions Iv had! The chirizo and the shisito Chow chow went so well with it.  The food here has amazing flavors and are unique and well balanced. My drink was also really good, it was their take on a Paloma and made with mezcal. The hubby got a pineapple rum drink and we both agreed it was a little basic.  I would say the hubby drink and the fact that it was a bit warm in there and in general the sort of squished seating were the only negatives.  But the awesome food far outshines any of that so I def look forward to coming back and sampling more of the menu!",

Not a huge amount of seating but nice and intimate. I would give 5 stars for service but the food was just okay. I had their new brunch dish, the Island French Toast. Y'all I love avocado and eat it daily... but the avocado puree with pineapple compote on top of French toast was a strange combo for me. It looked like baby food on top & pineapple chopped up. I scraped most of it off and enjoyed the perfect brioche French toast underneath. My only other frustration were the home fries were not even warm when they came to the table. $5 for side of those was dissapointing (thought menu said $4 too...) Nevertheless I would come back here again for cocktails. Nice spot and they have a parking lot which is great!",

Their talked-about cocktail menu extends to the morning for creative spins on drinks inspired by breakfast classics like cereal milk and their food menu is a series of creative takes on classics. The fried chicken is boneless and melts in your mouth over a bed of sweet potato hash and the various French toasts are delicious without being so big that you leave feeling heavy. I had a French today with a pineapple compote, avocado mousse, and coconut syrup and it was delicious. Definitely will be coming back here!",

    "text": "This is officially now my favorite restaurant!  The overall experience was superb!!! We had a reservation via open table for 915pm but arrived early around 830 just in case we could get a table. The hostess marked us here and said as soon as the current guests are done we can be seated. We headed over to the bar and we were immediately greeted with menus and glasses of water. From there we decided on 2 drinks. Before we could even take a sip the hostess said another table opened up and we could be seated. I'm like yassss for the service! The only slight downside is that it's noisy, so don't go on a first date here buuut other than that, it's perfect for anything else. They played 90s hip hop music so we were jamming ALL NIGHT!  So we get seated and I believe our waiter name was Peter (might be wrong). Well he took the time to break down the menu, explain how items are made and told us his favorites and why. From there we decided on the calamari, Notorious P.I.G. Puppies and the buttermilk kettle fried chicken. He brought out each item and further explained all of the ingredients and how the item is cooked.   The calamari and the sauce used had just enough spice. The calamari was cooked with just enough crunch. The puppies were good and the butter made it them so tasty. The pulled pork that was on top was tender and juicy and that comes from a Texas girl! Now the chicken...the buttermilk fried chicken...whew, my mouth watered just typing this. It was OH SO DELICIOUS!!! The corn spread under the chicken and the habanero vinaigrette gave it the extra mmph! My husband and I smashed alllll of the dishes with no problem.   All in all top 5 restaurant for me in Charlotte for overall experience including food quality, taste, drinks, customer service and the experience. My husband and I have been raving about this place since we went and can't wait to check out the Sunday Brunch!",

    "text": "We recently came here for restaurant week. I've been wanting to check it out since they opened and their restaurant week menu looked good so it seemed like a good time to try it.   They let you order off both the restaurant week menu and the normal menu which is nice. We decided to do one restaurant week order and then order other things off the regular menu that we really wanted to try.  For restaurant week we ordered the notorious P.I.G puppies, the buttermilk kettle fried chicken, and the Krispy Kreme bread pudding. Off of the regular menu we got the point Judith calamari, the octopus special, the ricotta gnocchi, and the local burrata. We were also with another couple and shared everything. We tried a little bit of the fried green tomato caprese, the Asian BBQ skirt steak, and ice cream trio they got as well.  I'll start by saying that everything was delicious. My favorites were the calamari, the octopus, the fried chicken, the ricotta gnocchi, and the bread pudding. The calamari was the star of the show. It was amazing. Fresh. Great sauce. The only calamari I've had that even compares was in a tiny seaside town in Ireland.   We tried a few drinks as well. We had Dat Juice, Some Like It Hot, and The Uncle Eddy. Dat Juice was my favorite, but they were all very good. I will say that as good as they were, I'd probably skip them next time to cut down on bill.   The service was incredible. We had the friendliest most helpful waiter. He made great recommendations for us.   Given the small plates style, it's not a cheap restaurant, but you get some really great food.   We all loved it. I would highly recommend Zeppelin for your next special occasion!",

Great place to go with a group so that you can try more plates. I suggest 1.5 plates per person.  Items we tried ranked in terms of my favorite to least favorite:  1) beef tartare with truffle egg. The mushroom and radish chips and pickled daikon and each type of sauce gave this dish many flavor profiles. 2) calamari with Korean Chile sauce and Serrano peppers. I love a fried food especially this dish. 3) pork belly buns. Buns were fresh and pork belly had the perfect sear. 4) gnocchi. This was almost tied with pork belly buns. Two buns per order. 5) yellowtail crudo. The only thing I did not like was the fried polenta that came with it. The yellowtail was great on its own. 6) fried chicken. Great for those that like heat. Wish it was spicy throughout the huge portion. Cornbread was great to cool it down. 7) burrata. Probably wouldn't order this again unless it came with some fried green tomatoes.  Our server Peter was great and gave us a lot of good tips for ordering. He even let me sample my cocktail first before ordering. Will definitely return for dinner and will come back to try their Sunday brunch.",

They were very accommodating of personal preferences and provided guidance for someone in my group trying to drink and avoid sugar.  We shared a number of items and the yellowtail was a hit. Light and refreshing with edible flowers and citrus. We liked this so much we ordered two.  Other favorites were the fried chicken with spicy mango on top and the steak dish.    It was simple to use Opentable to make a reservation and they have a patio with soft seating and tables that allows dogs. There were people with little kids, dates and business dinners when I went. Prices are high - you are paying for local and presentation (and I guess the address). However, it was a nice night out and lots of places to walk to in Southend after (Jeni's for ice cream, anyone?).",

We hadn't been to a tapas before and I LOVED it.   Our server was great with suggestions, really funny, and down to earth and relatable while still being professional.  We loved the exterior and feel of the place.   I ordered an Old Fashioned and it was probably the best one I've ever had. The fried green tomatoes were a thing of perfection. Coupled with the mozz cheese and that vibrant sauce, I couldn't stop eating them. The buns were our favorite (we ordered two because they were that good.) The meat was cooked perfectly and the buns were the perfect fluffy vessel to carry allll of that flavor. I could eat my weight in those...and that's a lot. The hush puppies were a little heavy for me but they didn't go to waste either. The scallops were cooked perfectly and even though we chuckled at the salad on top it was a wonderful accompaniment with the sauce underneath. Lastly, we had that AMAZING Krispy Kreme bread pudding. We also tried the peach ice cream which was delicious.",

I also got to try one of their spring drink specials, \"Baby, Don't Be Chai\" and it was a pretty tasty citrus drink. It included blood orange liquer, pomegranate flavor, and lemon juice, which all blended together very well.

It's rolled in a sweet thai chili sauce and that just completely elevated the flavors to a whole new level. I've never been a huge calamari fan but I took one bite and ended up ordering a whole order for myself! All their food is really good. However they have small plate portions and can be pretty pricey. So I suggest going with some friends, ordering a handful of different things and all sharing them. You'll still get full and you'll get to try a lot of dishes. Keep this at the top of your date night spots!",

Perhaps, they cater to \"a different type of crowd\". While the bartenders were quite nice and the 1 old-fashioned that I ordered was proper, the musical selection baffled me.   After about 30 minutes into enjoying my cocktail, I noticed that old school hip hop playing. So far, no issues. Then, I hear the n-word consistently dropped in song after song.   THIS is where I take issue. Not only is it culturally inappropriate and unprofessional, but the fact that such was happening while my friend and I were the ONLY people of color in the building...well, it raises questions...to say the least. I was offended.  The issue was brought to the manager's attention and we were told that the owner likes to play old school hip hop, but he prefers the unedited version. We were also informed that he has been advised not to do so, but opted not to change.   Such is his right. Such is also my right to write a review and opt not to patronize Zeppelin.",

    "text": "Zeppelin is at the moment a hidden gem in Charlotte. In a city filled with mostly chain/ less unique restaurants, Zeppelin offers a refreshing and original take on food. Ambiance and decor are spectacular! Unique dark woods and Edison bulbs mix in with some green moss like shrubs that create an intimate yet warm and comfy environment. Read, great spot for date night! Plus side, you can change it up and enjoy drinks or a meal on their front porch as well.   The food, I gotta say is well thought out, different and delicious! The chefs here really put thought into their food and try to think outside the box which I can really appreciate. The menu is constantly changing almost on a weekly basis and so are the drinks so what I recommend here may or may not be on the menu. Nonetheless, the Notorious P.I.G Puppies and Ricotta Gnocchi are a must in my opinion. Drink wise, the Poloma De La Parilla and the Uncle Eddy were my favorites. Bonus, the Uncle Eddy is their take on an Old Fashioned and comes smoked, the presentation is super cool! Also, the Zeppelin Pickleback shot, ask about it, just do it and if you try it like I did, prepared to be mind blown!  Last but not least, big shout out to our waiter Peter, he is the absolute best in every way - I'll always be requesting him in the future!",

    "text": "After reading tons of mixed reviews I didn't know what to expect from a meal at Zeppelin.  I ordered a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate and decided to give it a shot.    The environment is trendy, upscale with a play on Edison.  It's really cool.  They play fun rap music  kind of like little spoon (brunch spot in charlotte) but not as loud.  I liked it a lot.    The weather was nice so we sat outside.  Going early at 5, there wasn't a wait and our service was incredible.  It seems like previous reviews complained about wait times so i can't Attest to that because we were the only people there   We ordered a fig and goat cheese tart, gnocchi, pork steam buns, and banana blonde chocolate deliciousness for dessert.  I think the menu has changed from when they originally opened because items from previous reviews weren't on the menu.  Every single thing was so unique, flavorful, fresh, and tasted different than anything I've ever had.  It was incredible.  We were practically licking the plate.  The presentation was beautiful.    We ordered two cocktails as well and they were good.  From the patio you can see the top of the buildings uptown. All of the drinks and tapas are $9-20.  It is at a high end price point as previous reviews state, but all tapas places are about the same.    I noticed there is a way to put yourself on the waitlist but you can't make reservations through yelp.  I'm looking forward to coming back!!!!!",

    "text": "Of what the restaurants tries to be, this restaurant does not meet its expectations. The quality of the food, environment, and the service do not match the prices of this restaurant. We ended up spending $200 on our meal...  Quality of the food:  -My fiance and I ordered 5 small plates. We had the octopus, beef tartare, yellowtail crudo, pork buns, and the special egg pasta. The tartare and the pasta were good, pork buns were ok, octopus was over cooked and a bit fishy, and the yellowtail crudo was bland.  -Dessert was fabulous! We had the ice cream and the bread pudding.  -Cocktails were good - we had the Strawberry Fields, French 75, and Spring Fling -Overall, for spending $200, we didn't think that the food was good enough  Service: Service was not good. We got our first three tapas, which were hot, at the same time instead of staggered, so two of the meals were cold by the time we got around to eating them. Also, it took 25 minutes for our last dish to come out.   Environment: The restaurant has a neat interior, but the environment doesn't match the prices. It felt like we were eating dinner at a nice brewery.  Overall, this is more of a cocktail place than anything else. If you're looking for great tapas with reasonable prices and more upscale environment, then I would check out Bardo",

    "text": "We were so excited to try this place but were so disappointed.   Firstly, the wait times on the No Wait app are completely inaccurate. It told us to arrive at 7:56, but when we arrived the hostess said it would be another 30 minutes but that we could order a drink at a small side section of the bar. Apparently they seat at the bar, so they try to avoid people going to the main part to get drinks, which that part I understand...but seating at the bar after waiting hours? Anyway, we got drinks (giggle water and room to grow), and the cocktails were pretty good and pretty much what you expect to pay for cocktails at this kind of restaurant. We stood outside on the deck with the heaters to avoid the crazy crowdedness inside. I do appreciate the heaters and am grateful that the rain held out. We checked on our place in line an hour later (yes, this is an hour after we have already waited an hour and after the additional 30 minutes quoted by the hostess), and she says ANOTHER 30 minutes (*jaw drops to floor*). We've already waited so long that we decide to wait it out. Another 30 minutes later, she says our table is ready. 10 minutes later, we sit down. (End of waiting saga/rant, but the people must know what awaits).   Finally a table! YES! And we are so ready to eat. We wanted to start with a charcuterie board, but the prices were way higher on the actual menu than website menu, and we decided not worth it. (Side note: we love charcuterie's and didn't want to sour our charcuterie love with what had not been a not promising experience so far). Based on our tastes and the waitress's recommendations, we got the carrot, cabbage, and hushpuppy smalls. The carrots tasted really good especially with the ricotta, but were all cooked to different levels so some were really soft while others were almost raw. The cabbage was nice and tender but kind of tasted like your standard cabbage. We enjoyed the hush puppies, which were basically fancy hush puppies with bbq pork cheeks on top, so how could you go wrong. We were pretty full at this point, but didn't feel satisfied so we decided to order a big--the fried chicken, which a friend had recommended. I am glad to report, this was the best thing we had all night! Yay finally! The chicken was so tender and had a nice thin crispy breading. It also had a subtle smoked flavor and kind of spicy mixture underneath.  Side note: it was SO loud in there. No sound absorption at all so everything echoed. We had to yell across the table and could barely hear the waitress.  So--was the food good once we finally got to eat it: yes. Was it worth the wait: absolutely not. Based on the quality of the food, I would have been willing to wait 30 min. In total from getting in line to leaving, we spent 3.5 hours with Zeppelin. Aka way too much time. If we hadn't been misquoted so many times and had know this from the beginning, we probably would have just gotten a cocktail and left.   To sum up this way too long review: Zeppelin is worth trying if you have a lot of time to wait and expect to be misquoted on wait time. Otherwise, there are a lot of restaurants in Charlotte with just as good or better food and cocktails for around the same price (or less).",

    "text": "While the food looked interesting, our party was never seated due to completely sub-par front of the house staff. We were a party of six that arrived at 6 pm fully prepared to wait for a table. Hostess took our name and said about 45 minutes. Fine- we had a decent but overpriced drink at the bar. When we checked back an hour later she said there was a two hour wait- what can you do?  The actual issue was complete lack of table Management such that a six top was never going to became available. Again, that's fine just tell me when I walk in at 6 pm on Saturday that you don't manage to a party of six and I'll go somewhere else. But don't have me waste a prime hour of time and then have 1-2 hour waits at all South End restaurants.  For the prices they want to charge, they need management that actually tries and cares.",

    "text": "My wife and I went out for a date night at Zeppelin over their opening weekend and our overall experience was fantastic. The food was delicious, and our server Brittney was friendly and attentive. Our biggest complaint is that they do not accept reservations, but instead use the no wait app. You can't put your name on the list until you're within 5 miles of the restaurant and with a 60 minute wait, you're still waiting quite a while in the restaurant. As for the food, it is tapas style, and it all came out about the same time. The collards and apples salad was delicious! The Granny Smith apples, sweet potatoes, and collards mesh so well together I almost forgot I was eating a salad! The Maine Lobster and Avocado Toast was very flavorful, and presented very nicely. Our \"entree\" was the buttermilk poached kettle fried chicken. The server told us when we ordered that it was spicy, she did not tell a lie. I've never tried Nashville hot chicken, but it has to be of a similar spice level. The habanero vinaigrette really puts a kick in this dish. If you don't like spice, I would pass on the chicken even though it was very good, I think... (my mouth may still be on fire). Overall a great restaurant where you can relax without being rushed and have a delicious meal.",

The drink was terrible as was the service. I thought I would move on with the fried chicken but it was also terrible. It was clearly refried after being made. Paid a lot of money for garbage. I don't normally write bad reviews but this place was terrible. I hate to do this to a local business but it was really that bad.",

Similar to Stephanie B., I walked in with a friend and was told that they were full, but if we wanted a drink we could \"get one and stand over in the corner - the bar is for people who are eating\". Not the way you want to be greeted when trying to support a new cocktail place in your neighborhood. We felt like a burden instead of being welcomed, and immediately left.  Place seems to have a lot of potential and is somewhere I would love to experience, but should really revisit how they navigate the front of the house. Maybe it will be better once it's warmer and the outside opens up.",

The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. And let me tell ya about the patio and the music; it was great! That night they were playing a playlist from the late 90s and my friends and I really enjoyed it.  I had the Fried Green Tomato Caprese and it was memorable. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "If you like bacon, this is the place for you!   I came here on a Wednesday night for a birthday dinner and the place was already somewhat packed by 7:00 when we arrived. They don't take reservations so our group of 5 was seated in a very cozy booth.  It was a bit of a squeeze. We started off with a number of different cocktails, and all of them were delicious, creative, and unique.  Because it was a birthday celebration, we also decided to try the pickle-backs, which were significantly better than any pickle-back I've ever had! They were served with some sort of globe of pickle juice that's difficult to describe, but yummy. Onto the food.  We got a charcuterie board and the selection is delicious.  I would have liked more crackers and accompanying pickles, etc., but it was still a good plate.  I did, however, have a difficult time finding other food options since I don't eat bacon or meat.  To be honest, if you're a strict vegetarian, the choices here are extremely limited.  I'm typically able to order food without the bacon or meat but most of the menu has bacon infused into the food which made finding something to eat a True challenge.  I also found the servings to be a bit small for the price.   We ended our birthday dinner with a desert, which was excellent.   I should also mention that our waitress was truly outstanding. She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu in its entirety and provided excellent service.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Zeppelin but I would not recommend them for someone who doesn't eat meat or simply doesn't eat bacon.  I'd probably come back for the cocktails.",

They have a great cocktail list, my friend ordered the gin & tonic and said it was the best he ever had.  We ordered small plates and they all were delicious.  The fried chicken was the best I have ever had!  The only reason for a 4 versus 5 star is the service was a little slow, not attentive enough -- probably need more staff and the lobster Mac and cheese was more like a pasta dish with cheese on top, delicious but not a traditional lobster Mac and cheese.  The atmosphere is small, elegant and lively!",
