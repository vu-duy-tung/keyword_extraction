There were 5-6 other tables already seated.  There were 2 servers running tables so it was not busy enough to cause the poor service.  We were not greeted when we entered, even though they were standing by the door, they never introduced themselves, they never came back to the table to top off drinks, check how we were doing, see if we needed anything, nothing.  Bad service, poor menu, and average food is not what expected.",

I do think that if you have someone who is not a fan of sushi or has never tried it, you need to bring them here and they'll instantly be converted!  We had the cherry blossom, pink floyd and firecracker rolls.  Could not even beging to tell you our favorite because they were all outstanding!  I also had the wonton soup and house special friend rice...both were full of flavor.  So many times I've had wonton soup that has basically been brown water/broth with a dumpling thrown in.  The wonton I had last nigh at Koishi was rich with flavor....excellent!  Highly recommend this restaurant!!",

They recently rennovated it to be a more modern and young feel with colored-lights, which I find appealing.   The sushi is yummolicious! I love their volcano roll! If you love baked scallops and imitation crab meat with lots of spicy mayo, this is your roll! I also love the grasshopper roll with shrimp tempura and seaweed salad on top.What an interesting combination right? It's delicious. If you want something visually appealing, I would go with the cherry blossom roll. You'll see why when you get it!   As for the Chinese dishes, I don't care too much for them. I don't know if this restaurant loves to use sugar, but their sauces are all a bit sweet. If you go here, I would stick to the sushi and stay away from the Chinese.",

I highly recommend the Ichiban Roll (tempura shrimp, eel, avocado, unagi sauce) - it's a great spin on the Caterpillar Roll, but the added texture & flavor of the tempura shrimp make even the most novice sushi people happy. The Hot Lover Roll is also a personal favorite (scallop, masago, tobiko, sriracha, and spicy mayo sauce), though I am a scallop sushi aficionado, so am fairly biased. I tend to stick to sushi when I order from Koishi, so am not sure how their Chinese/Pan-Asian dishes are.",

I ordered takeout thru Grubhub last night for 1 each of Spicy tuna hand roll, Spicy yellowtail hand roll, and a Firecracker maki roll. What I received were 2 unspicy tuna hand rolls and a dull. muddled tasting  and chewy Firecracker roll. The nori on the hand rolls was tough as saran wrap. The pickled ginger, gari, is restaurant made from regular ginger and is also tough and extra vinegar-ed. At least they don't use green horse radish for wasabi. I think the restaurant is on a slow descent to closing and cutting corners, although from the first review here quality issues reappear. Apparently Grubhub is aware of slow service because ordering takeout at 6:30pm orders are predicted to arrive in the 8:20 to 8:45 window. So when mine arrived after an hour and half, that was a little early. What I should've done is hop in the car, drive to Carolina Place mall area and stopped in at Mr Tokyo for outstanding, buttery fresh seafoods in my sushi. It's that much better with the plus of being all you can eat for less than my total at Koisha. That's the future for me.",

I had heard that they had authentic sushi and so when the Adventurous Palates group decided to go there, I was in. We got a very wide variety of rolls, soup, apps and entrees. Some of it was good, most of it was OK.  I went back another two times with my husband and I wasn't blown away by the quality of the fish any of the times i went and found it very very average.   The service was not too bad with the big group but when it was two of us it was slower, oddly. And unfortunately it feels like you're in a renovated Pizza Hut.   Bottom line: The service, food and environment all left a bit to be desired. Will you hate your experience there? No. Will you love it? No. For me, not worth the drive unfortunately.",

We just arrived in Charlotte and tried this restaurant based on the reviews on Yelp. It is unimaginable to me that this place is capable of four stars.

Not sure what waiter everyone else had, but the waiter I got was beyond serious and practically scared my mom.  When we first arrived there was no one there. The place was nicely decorated on the inside though. We waited and were about to leave when he finally came out and sat us at a table. His attitude just seemed like he didn't even want us there. After he took our order, he literally only came back once to check on us. Then disappeared to the back and we had to wait forever for him to come out so I could get the check. (I could have just walked out without paying! Though not my style I'm not that mean) when he finally came out and I ordered the check, he went back there again... By then my mom was kinda upset so we just walked to the register, I guess he forgot I had just asked for the check???  The food... Maybe I'm spoiled or just used to better tasting sushi if I'm paying more then $10. Whatever. I ordered the cherry blossom roll, my mom got rainbow roll. I've had rainbow roll before at various places and is usually tasty, but this was just plain and the fish tasted old. My cherry blossom roll, although very pretty and nice to look at was equally as bland as the rainbow. Forgive me if I like to taste the shrimp or tuna that I'm eating. I would give this place 1 star, but we also ordered shrimp fried rice which was by far the best thing we ate there. Thank you shrimp fried rice! For that I give it 2 stars. Will I be returning to give it another shot? Nope! Not even worth it.  Did I mention that it was my mom's birthday?! Thank you koishi for ruining it. I should have just driven the extra miles in traffic and taken her to sushiya or oneu.",

    "text": "After a few months, decided to try Koishi again and had to note some changes. Still no egg roll substitutions, still fairly small sushi portions, still kind of cold on the service - but they definitely decreased the wait time, and from what I can tell completely nixed the bento box.  (For the lunch sushi combos) A nice portion of salad came out first, with the same really good dressing. Before I could even finish my salad, a small plate with my 2 rolls of small 4-5 pieces each arrive, along with an eggroll and dipping sauce on another plate. A mildly less than fresh smell from the fish and the tempura shrimp smelled like they either needed to change their oil or had switched to a more pungent type - kept getting hints of concession stand fryer-ness, a little odd.   I don't think I can up the stars because really, it still is just \"a-ok\" in my book. Water sat empty for a little bit, some rolls are below par for lunch sushi - but it's still a decent meal for a decent price.  If I go back I think I'll branch away from sushi and look into their entrees.",

    "text": "The search for good, affordable sushi is always a challenge for me. You don't want to pay too much, but you also don't want to pay too little - as that's a little frightening when you're thinking about super cheap raw fish entering your stomach. So, imagine my delight when Cotswold centered Koishi offers a sweet lunch special for $8.95.  A few girlfriends and I dropped by this affordable sushi heaven for a quick weekday lunch. Inside (and outside), Koishi isn't much to look at - it's in an old Pizza Hut. No joke. Don't expect to be dancing in any strobe lights or bumping to the hot beats in this joint. But, it's clean and the employees are friendly enough to make you feel welcome.   For lunch I chose \"Sushi A\", which, for $8.95 is a pretty sweet deal. This special includes two maki rolls (you choose from a list of ten or so), soup or salad and an egg roll. For my maki, I went with the spicy yellowtail roll and the California roll. The rolls weren't anything spectacular, but they were fresh and cheap. Perfect for lunch in my opinion!  As for my other \"Sushi A\" components, the salad was fresh and had a great ginger dressing. And last but not least, their eggroll wasn't too greasy and didn't burn off my fingers when I picked it up. That's a good eggroll in my book.   So, is Koishi the best sushi in Charlotte? Nah. But this place offers a convenient, cheap and fresh lunch that will satisfy many.",

However, once you get inside it's lovely! They must have decorated since some of the last reviews because it is well decorated in a modern theme.   After being intrigued by it's $8.95 sushi lunch special, I had to check it out for myself. I have to agree, it's good and affordable! Hubs ordered the Veggie Feast and it was a nice-sized portion of a flavorful dish. When you are ready to leave, they give you Andes mints! Oh, they think of everything to make a good impression!  The service was very attentive. When they weren't serving, they were cleaning off tables or sweeping the floors. Big plus in my book!  I'm pleasantly surprised and happy to have found a new sushi and Asian cuisine stop! I will return!",

I started with the miso soup, just okay, and the spring roll, which was very disappointing. The vegetables inside tasted stale, or very bland. Would pass on that next time. On to the sushi. I ordered a salmon hand roll & it was awesome. The salmon was fresh & the rice steamed to perfection. I definitely enjoyed. I chose the Cherry Blossom roll and really enjoyed it. The only disappointing thing was the fried shrimp was almost non-existent. A little more shrimp would have made it perfect. Overall, as I said, ok.",

Food - I was somewhat overwhelmed with the choices of sushi, appetizers, entrees, and etc.. But with a little help from the waitress, I started with the volcano salad - crab, masago, cucumber, medium spicy.. OH MY GOODNESS, was deeelicious.  I am craving it now, while I am typing this. Then I ordered the traditional shrimp tempura roll, which was not bad, and my husband loved the cherry blossom roll (since we were told i was the most popular one).    Service - We had a kind waitress who was attentive and took care of us.  So I cannot complain.   Price - It was manageable.  As any sushi place, they will be a bit pricey, but we chose this place because it was not as pricey as other sushi restaurants.    Koishi! My husband and I will be back!",

I have tried so many rolls on the menu that I can't give a review of just one.    They are all so good.  I will say this is the place you take someone to convert them to loving sushi if they don't already.  The rolls are not cheap, but they are not over priced as well.  You definitely get what you pay for.  I will pinpoint my favorite roll as the Grasshopper roll.    The entrees are good as well.  I would rank them up there with any other higher end\"ish\" Chinese cuisines (i.e. P.F Changs).  The dining room is not the largest and the ambiance sometimes is lacking. The service is definitely not going above and beyond, but at the end of the day, the food comes out in a decent amount of time and the water glass gets refilled. For me, its all about the rolls and that's why I keep coming back.",

There's always 20% off check total coupons in local clipper magazine. The sushi here is decent but you can't beat all that food for just $9.99! You definitely don't go hungry and I usually can't finish all the food.",

I went in the first time to a packed restaurant, sat around a lively bar, chatted with a regular about the tempura, left having thought I found my new favorite spot.  The next two times I went in, things were just weird.  The restaurant was eerily quiet.  There were three iPods laying out by a sound system, but there was no music playing.  It took a really long time to be seated, though there were plenty of seats.  The last time I was seated, I watched SEVEN employees outnumbering the customers) stand around looking at their phones, chatting with each other, and blankly staring off into space while I waited for service.  I started making eye contact with servers, trying to signal.  No one in this tiny restaurant even acknowledged me for over 10 minutes.    Finally, I got my glass of wine to sip while I ordered takeout.  A server sat down right next to me (in an almost empty restaurant, with plenty of tables to choose to work from) and started rolling silverware.  In fact, she was pushing her flatware pyramid against my notebooks and papers I was working on.  There were so many other open tables, why was this happening?  The dead silence didn't help.    The portions are small, and I always leave feeling like I didn't get my money's worth.  I would almost be ok with that if the place was at all cool to hang out in.  I've tried to like this place.  It's a shame.",

When the avocado is grey with dark spots it makes me wonder two things. One, why would anyone serve a bad avocado not to mention wrap a roll in it for all to see. Second it makes me wonder if anything else there is fresh.       Along with the sushi I had the seafood bird nest something that was 50% Surumi (fake stringy crab sticks). Not appealing at all.  And the scallop Pad Thai. One scallop sliced, no way there was two.  I'm surprised at the 4 and 5 star reviews. There has to be much better sushi in Charlotte than this.",

There's a sushi bar just inside the door facing the kitchen, booths on either sides and a few tables in the middle.  The dinner group met here last night (and for once everyone showed up).  This was my 2nd attempt at sushi.  I started with the seafood hot and sour soup.  The soup was good but i didn't really care for the seafood addition.  I also ordered the King Tuna roll which was tasty.  The rolls weren't as big as my first experience with sushi at Cowfish but they it was still good.  Next time I come back here, Ill know to order more.  Others around my table seemed to be satisfied with their meals. The person next to me went for the General Tso's chicken which was beautifully presented and another person went for a noodle dish that came in a very cute bowl.    Service was excellent here and I can definitely see myself returning here.",

The decor is a lot nicer than Ru Sans  and Akahana ( In Plaza). Our waiter was kind and recommended a few rolls. We split the Pink Floyd, Giant Saporo Roll and a Philly Roll.

The place was fairly empty around 12:30, which was nice.  I ordered the Sushi B lunch special that is a roll and 4 nigiri - I tried a bit of everything.  Nothing really special stuck out from the lunch menu, other than the appetizer salad is pretty big.  You get a solid amount of fish on the lunch specials, but it's nothing that blows your mind.  Service was good.  The dude was nice and not overbearing - he let us talk and eat freely without much interruptions.  He was attentive as well - good job, tall dude with glasses.  Ambiance was questionable at lunch.  It's not wholly the restaurant's problem but for the first part of lunch, there was a little baby that would just scream randomly - that got annoying pretty quick.  Luckily, they left.  I wonder how this place does at night - it looks like it could be pretty cool.    Plenty of parking.  dmo out",

He continually tries to sneak in extra gratuity into our bills at checkout. He will charge 20+% gratuity and then when you give payment, he will return with only the non-itemized bill hoping you won't notice and will tip on top of it. He said they charge gratuity for groups of 5+, but this has not always been the case.   To make it worse, two people at our table (who ordered the same thing as me) had been charged 15% tip while I had been charged 25% tip. I typically visit once a week, but I won't be returning.

Most in our party found that the food was fine, but nothing special.  When we first walked in we were virtually ignored for a moment and then seated.  Our waiter was brusque with us, but he did keep our drinks filled and brought out our food, but no friendliness and no frills.    The food was fine, but not as awesome as I'd hoped.  The seafood hot and sour soup was lukewarm and not very flavorful.  I wouldn't get that again.  The side salad with ginger dressing was yummy!  It was my favorite dish of the day.  The ginger dressing is different, almost a cross between ginger dressing and shrimp sauce.  Our sushi rolls were good, but not special.  There are better choices in Charlotte, but I chose this one, believe it or not, because of the parking.  We went to a few places closer to downtown and parking was such a hassle, I just went to the next place on the list.",

We have had many days where we were too tired to cook: a long day after work, after a long travel day, weekend days, etc. I would have previously given a 3 star for consistent food. However, our takeout tonight, presented a different story. My boyfriend took the first bite of his food and bit into a rock. I'm sorry, if you're paying attention to the quality and preparation of your food, there is NO excuse for a ROCK in your food. We sealed everything back up, and returned to the restaurant for a refund. If there's a rock in there, what else is going on in that kitchen?   Upon arrival to return the food, the hostess was laughing and being exceptionally unprofessional. A group of staff gathered and were equally unprofessional and simply dismissive and aloof about the public health severity of this disgusting incident. They offered we keep the food that did not have the rock, which we refused since we choose not to consume questionably made food.   Glad we weren't giving a bite to a child or breaking teeth. Watch out.",

Our waitress, Victoria aka server 8, rarely checked on our table, we had to call her over to place our order and again if we wanted more drinks.  One person's food came 10 minutes before everyone else's. This restaurant included the tip on our 5top. I've NEVER heard of that before. No wonder she was so inattentive.  When I went to complain to hostess server #8 aggressively let us know how she felt as we left.  Side note, server 8 was our waitress previously and was pretty awful then too.  Really bummed out because the food is great but I most likely will never go back.",

What? Ok...whatever.  So I got a huge bowl of $9 lo mein with added tofu for lunch.  He said they are no veggie egg rolls when I've gotten them there before.  So I got a spring roll that was not good.  He never checked on us. Gave me only a tiny serving of hot sauce, didn't refill my water, didn't say thank you when we paid...just a bad experience.

First of all, the place is a dive...a worn down, cheap-looking, diner-like ambience with this lackluster taupe/beige color scheme...just all Blaaaah.  The overhead music also had that same trucker-friendly vibe (think it was just some generic rock...not even Top 40).  I stopped in for what I hoped to be a late lunch (around 3 pm?), and was told right away that lunch-hour is over, and now serving dinner. :(  Then when I placed an order of Squid Salad, I was told that the Squid is frozen, so not serving that. :(:(  I went with their signature \"Cherry Blossom\" dish, along with a side order of Tempura.  Although the \"Cherry Blossom\" was quite cute, with pink maki rolls in a flower-pattern design, it was way over-priced for what it was.  Same with the Tempura dish...way overpriced, almost as much as a meal!  The food wasn't bad, but nothing special...and definitely not worth the high price.  You can get much better maki rolls and tempura in another Japanese restaurant that actually has snazzy ambience to match the pricing.  For what I consider a near trashy ambience, it just didn't seem right that I had to pay nearly $30 for these 2 dishes (good, but not exceptional).  Lacking smiley disposition, the waiter wasn't exactly friendly or welcoming...but he was quick and attentive, so no major beef there.  Overall, it was a 2-star dining experience, with well over a 3-star price.  Just not worth it for me.",

It's very unassuming from the outside, but the inside has a more intimate feel to it. Sure it's not decorated, or laid out the same as other sushi spots in CLT, but I was impressed by the food.   I started with a veggie spring roll, which was mostly comprised of cabbage (there were other veggies in there too), but it was delicately fried and you could actually taste the vegetables rather than oil and mush. Then, being that it was my first time here, I went with two staple rolls that I always try at any spot - spicy tuna and California (granted I also didn't have a huge appetite and some other rolls were massive!). Both were on the smaller side, but the tuna was fresh and delicate, and I appreciated that the roll was just spicy tuna, no other fillers. Overall, the sushi was tasty, and I honestly loved the price points....much more reasonable for the same rolls than other spots closer to uptown. I definitely will be back to try some different rolls!",

But I am more than willing to try any other kind. So needless to say, I was definitely impressed with Koishi.   We just recently moved right around the corner and am so happy that we found a close by Chinese/sushi spot to fill those cravings. The menu is HUGE! And everything looks delicious, it literally took my boyfriend and I about 25 minutes to figure out what we wanted. But so worth the contemplating :)   We got the steamed dumplings as an app, delish. I got the house goner salad, which was amazing and a really big portion which I was really happy with because I always find myself wishing it was bigger at other restaurants. For our entrees, we got the shrimp noodles, ACAC roll, and the shrimp roll. Omg where to begin! All of it was sooooo good. The noodles were perfectly seasoned and had the right amount of soy sauce where it wasn't overpowering at all. The rolls were big and delicious! I added cream cheese to the ACAC (vegetarian) which was awesome. And I mean you can never go wrong with a tempura shrimp roll! Everything tasted super fresh and they were great portion sizes.   The interior was really nice. Very modern, quaint and comfy. The staff was really nice and really knew their stuff about the menu, we had a ton of questions. The menu is very affordable and has a wide variety of things for everybody's pallet. Cannot wait to return!!!",

After a couple of minutes I was finally acknowledged by a gentleman who sat me.  Upon looking at the menu I noticed it was a dinner menu and asked for the lunch menu.  I was told that I arrived at 2:33.  Keep in mind I stood there before being seated for a few minutes, which I let the gentleman know - he did not care.  It was white and black to him I wasn't seated before 2:30.  Being it that I was starving and it was raining outside I choose to stay and eat at the dinner menu prices which are nearly double the lunch prices.  Lunch special for my meal is 6.95 dinner price is 11.95  I have eaten here for lunch before and the portion size did not appear to be that different in size. Had it not been raining and I not walked over ( I work right across the street ) I would have left and went elsewhere.  In review: Food is good, service and hospitality is bad.",

The quality of the fish and originality of the sushi rolls are somewhat lacking.  Most every roll on the menu is deep fried or  includes a fried portion of fish within the roll.  I know this is a popular preparation right now but it is not really what I would call sushi.  So the creativity is not there but this is still an average sushi place that you can frequent on occasion.  Their is usually a Groupon or coupon out there somewhere so make sure you get one of those, do your best not to pay full price here.  One our most recent trip we got the grasshopper roll, the cherry blossom and some orange chicken Chinese food dish.  The Chinese food was surprisingly good, crispy, flavorful and well cooked.  The sushi is what it is, average.  People think average is bad, it is not, it is middle of the road.  This place is middle of the road.",

The menu is expansive with sushi, stir fry, Chinese and Japanese entree choices.  I usually go for the sushi - and in this case, ordered the Just Pete roll and a yellowtail scallion roll, both with brown rice.  The sushi is always a great mix of textures and flavors - and I like that there's creative use of smoked salmon in several of the rolls.  There are a ton of signature maki to choose from - you could order a new roll every time you visit and not run out of options until the 7th or 8th visit.  The only downside is that the interior lacks some personality, but when the food is so tasty, you don't really notice.  Highly recommend!",

Pieces are correctly sized (most sushi is made too big) and 2 to an order. Fish was lovely and fresh. Rice was good. Price is appropriate. Nothing nearby like it, so I'll go again - it was worth it.  If you seek ambiance go elsewhere - place is ugly as a bowery bar.  I don't seek ambiance, so the Pizza Hut origins don't bother me.    Somehow I think they could be better - given the paucity of good sushi in Charlotte, I hope they do.",

    "text": "Don't let the Pizza Hut exterior fool you; this is a decent place to grab a quick, fresh and cheap sushi combo lunch.   Have been a few times with friends and mostly order the Sushi A combo for $8.95, which gets you two maki rolls (generally go with the California and Spicy Tuna), a ginger salad, and an egg roll. The ginger dressing here is quite good, but be sure to ask for it on the side unless you want your lettuce literally drowning in ginger goodness. The veggie egg roll isn't too greasy and the sushi is average but fresh. All this for $8.95 makes it a great lunch deal if you're in the Cotswold area.   A must have if you aren't ordering off of the combo menu is the Cherry Blossom roll. It's the best roll I've had at Koishi and comes out looking like a flower, which gives it a little extra something, in my humble opinion.   Service is a bit on the slow side but generally friendly. And there is plenty of parking on the side and behind the building. Only gripe is that it's tough to get in/leave with the barrier in center of Sharon Amity and the no U-turn signs, but no worries; it's worth the bit of extra maneuvering.",

I haven't once been there where the entire parties food has come out at the same time.  I also think the sushi pieces are very small compared to some other places I've been to in town.  On a postive note the staff is friendly they do take-out and have an extensive menu for sushi and chinese food.",

Apparently, no amount of interior re-decorated could take away the spirit of Pizza Hut.    I felt like I was in a pizza hut that could have been located in downtown Beijing.  I had read that Koi was owned by a family known for their restaurants, especially in the Charlotte area.   I ordered a Gen. Tsao chicken and it was utterly bland.   Prices for the Chinese dishes range from 8-13 bucks.  I decided to try what makes this particular restaurant unique in Cotswald and that is Sushi.   The Maki was good, with decently sized shrimp, but rather bland.    I am still unsure as to how to really rate this place.   It was good but felt tentative.  Definately ok if you don't feel like going far and you live in the Cotswald area - but there are better places if you don't mind driving just a few miles.",

The sushi here is pretty expensive for what you get but this place is close to where we live and my family loves sushi so we wanted to give the place more than a fair shot in the hopes that it would improve.  It didn't - the last time we went we found a piece of metal on one of the rolls.  It was curly and a few mm in length.  We brought it to the attention of our waiter and he didn't say a word.  He simply picked it up and took it to the kitchen to apparently discuss it with the manager or the cook.  A bit later when he brought the check he said that the manager thought it came from the Brillo pad that they use on the cookware.  That was it. No apology, no offer to take that item of the bill, no visit from the manager, nothing.  Perhaps I look like I need to increase my iron intake but it won't be from Koishi.  There are far better sushi restaurants a little farther out.",

What I DID mind was the 50 minute wait for a to-go order to be completed; when I called to place the order, I was told it would take 25 minutes.  We probably showed up after 30, and then proceeded to sit on a bench for another 20 minutes until the order was complete.  By the time we got our three (yes, only three) rolls home, the spider roll was cold and mushy.  The other two were fine (spicy salmon and rainbow), but after the long wait I think I was maybe just glad to be eating anything.  Provided you don't mind waiting for them to catch, debone and descale, and then finally make your dinner, Koishi is a decent option... but there's many other choices around town.",
