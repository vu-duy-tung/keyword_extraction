My roommates and I used to go so often that several of the staff that used to work there would know our order just by seeing our faces. Now that I live quite a bit out I don't get to eat here as much as I wish I could but I still hype this place up to anyone out of town. The staff are always really nice. The only downside is that it's kinda pricey. The portion size is pretty good before the price increase. If you've had halal cart, the portion size of this is twice as big but also 3x the price. I've always ordered the lamb mandi or lamb shank, both are ridonkulously delicious!",

We arrived late after a long day of work,but we were greeted in a very warm and friendly manner. Even though it was already 9 pm, they made us feel welcome and the food was hot,fresh, and amazingly delicious.   The portions are generous,the food is fresh, they use quality authentic ingredients, and you can tell the the chef takes pride in their work and their food. Even the rice is full of rich aroma and flavors!  Thank you for an awesome dining experience, authentic and rich food, and kind hospitality!",

The rice was flavorful and the salad was full of feta and red onion - just how I like it! The kebab was delicious - perfectly spiced and tender.   My dinner companion had the Philly cheesesteak, which he enjoyed, and the chicken shawarma pita, which he said was not great - the pita was hard.   The baklava was very disappointing.   For my second visit, I recommended this place to a group. It took a long time for us to receive our food. But everyone thought it was delicious!   I'll be back!",

I am a newly-aware falafel freak and ever since I have made the discovery, this has been my go-to place for Mediterranean food. I have had other dishes Here including chicken kabob, falafel wrap, falafel appetizer, geek salad...I recommend trying it all.  I have yet to dine in here, but the times that I have gone the staff is always nice and the restaurant seems very clean. It will vary greatly with the potential language-barrier with some of the staff, but in the end They are very accommodating. It has indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating isn't on an enclosed patio so be prepared to be just kind of out there on the sidewalk. But it's cool :-)  They do take quite a long time if placing a carry-out, for obvious reasons (freshness perhaps) so I do recommend calling way ahead. The parking lot is usually the devil, but that is the least of a concern. It's certainly worth wiggling in and out of the awkward, Always-packed lot!",

We don't eat meat, but did a wide-ranging sample of the vegetarian offerings - best I've had in Charlotte since we lost the Middle East Deli on Independence.   We started with stuffed grape leaves and Ful Madammas, which I'd never had before.  Both were excellent, as were the lentil soup, hummus, baba ghanouj, and tabouleh ... fantastic.  I restrained myself because I'm crazy for a good falafel wrap, and I got it here. Perfect balance of ingredients and flavors, exactly the right amount of tahini.  For you omnivores, others in our group had meat kebabs and shawarma and said they were fantastic.    Our evening here was a great experience and I recommend to others in search of quality middle-eastern food.  Our servers, Arij and Wayne, couldn't have been nicer or more helpful, and all the staff seem to value every guest. We don't live near the university and, esp with light rail construction, were concerned about traffic and parking, but both were surprisingly easy, at dinnertime on a weekday!  The portions are truly generous, as others have mentioned. It would be impossible to leave here hungry, and you'll enjoy the experience, and every single bite!",

I did not like their versions of some \"basics,\" namely the grape leaves and the hummus. The falafel was good and the mixed grill plate I had with the fattoush salad was awesome. I split it with my sister and we still had tons of food. Others at the table tried the shrimp kabobs, shawarma, and a variety of salads. Everyone was very satisfied.

Only complaint about the place overall is the music (turn it down a little) and the odd heaters placed here and there? Also doesn't look like they've done any updating since this place was Yoshi's but I can get over ALL of that bc the food was great! I had the lunch special: chicken kabob with 2 sides for $6.99. I chose hummus (they spelled hummos?) and rice pilaf. The hummus was a $.99 up charge but well worth it. Some of the best I've had and I'm a huge hummus fan. The rice was delicious, had I had any more room to finish it, I would have! The garlic sauce/dip to spread on your meat...MMMMMMMM!! Slather it on the chicken because it's gooood! Enjoy!",

The servings are large, especially if you order rice as your side.  The side salad that comes with the platters is crisp, fresh and with hints of parsley and lemony.  Just writing about this is making me want to have some chicken shawerma!  My husband ordered the lamb shawerma and I tasted it.  It was also very good but the chicken shawerma takes the cake!! On my first visit the owner brought us a free sample of their hummus.  We were already stuffed but ate it out of curtesy and it was delish.

I had shawarma was excellent and all of the sides and salads were delicious. The food was very visually appealing and looked extremely fresh. I was here with my parents who are pretty narrow in their food choices but they really enjoyed the gyros, so I guess there is something for everyone here. Definitely one of my favorite new restaurants I've found in recent memory and one I hope to revisit the next time I'm in the area.",

The lentil soup was made with pureed potato's , the lamb had a musky smell to it. Chicken was baked before grilling , hummus was out of this world bland , and the table service was the least a person can hope for .   Will not visit again",

Let me start by saying I really want to give this place more stars as I really liked how things looked walking in and I so want to find a good solution for my Middle Eastern food needs in the area.  Called my order in ahead which went very well, the guy on the phone was nice and helpful. Was in a hurry on way to the Panthers game and there were three of us so IlI ordered three double chicken shawarma wraps with fries.  Everything was ready when we picked up and again, people were friendly and the ambience of the place looked really great. I want to go back and try some of the rice and grilled meat dishes I saw being served while I was there.  Unfortunately our take-out meals were below average. The wraps themselves were decent, nothing spectacular. A lot of pickle flavor, the chicken was just fine.  The fries were horrible. They had no salt on them and I am quite sure they were left over fries that has been thrown back in the fryer. Dried out and tasted like the oil was not fresh. Really bad.  In a small plastic dish was a white sauce. I was hoping for tzaziki sauce or maybe a yogurt dip but instead it was a garlicky mayonnaise. Tasted just like garlic stirred into common mayonnaise. Yuck.   We all commented that Fast Food would have been just as good. Here's hoping I can go back and give them a fair try sitting down in the restaurant and ordering off the menu.",

The kabob was good as well as the rice but what I really loved was the yogurt that came with it. It looked like they made it in house and it was great to dip the kabob and rice in. We had the hummus and pita as an appetizer- probably some of the best hummus I've ever eaten. We also had the baklava which was a little smaller than I wanted but delicious and you can't beat the price!",

My fiance hadn't had Greek food previously, and it won him over.  We had a pick your own appetizer, where you picked three of five items.  Then we shared the entree of three different kebabs over rice with a side.  We had baklava for dessert.  Everything was excellent.  My favorite was the beef kebab, which is saying something since I am mostly vegetarian these days.",

We just recently arrived back from NYC where we tried the famous \"halal guys\" food  truck as our first introduction to mediterranean food, and since then knew we had to try a local place to see if  we loved it just as much.   We started with the hummus & pita & falafel. The hummus was a perfect consistency..creamy & smooth with just the right amout of roasted red pepper & chickpeas on top. It was delicious. The falafel was pretty tasty too,  For my entree I had the chicken shawarma (thinking it was similar to what I had in NYC) the chicken was tender & seasoned perfectly but I was not a fan of a spice in the rice. My husband had the \"combo shawerma\" consisting of lamb/chicken & he loved.  The portions are large & the wait staff were nice. We will go back if in the University area!",

They have a nightly buffet for Ramadan. Get there by 8:15 to secure a table, but eating (and drinking even water) doesn't begin until 8:35. Technically, if you aren't muslim you can eat before then, but it would be very rude.  Everyone else there will have been fasting since sun-down. About 8:25 people will start lining up to fix their plates so when the time comes, they are ready to eat.  Go and get some great food and witness a cultural holiday different than your own!",

It is a little messy to eat as liquid keeps seeping out. No matter. Just have napkins on hand. The fries were standard. No salt on them. But they have ketchup on hand.  Now the flan. Cheese based flan. Yum! Best part of my meal! Good texture - smooth. Right amount of sweetness - meaning not overly sweet. And the caramel sauce was enough so it could still sweeten it up!! Perfect.  Would come back for the flan. Maybe not the rest. But they do have an extensive menu....",

My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch and ordered the appetizer combination tray with stuffed grape leaves, baba gnoush, and hummus. I wasn't crazy about the hummus, but the grape leaves and baba gnoush were excellent! We also ordered falafel sandwiches. The falafel itself was excellent and the best I've tried in Charlotte; my only criticism is that I wish the wrap had more pickle. The bread and pita that accompanied our starters was fresh and tasty.  I'll definitely be back! It was quick and very affordable, the staff was also quite friendly.  Update: June 2012- Since my initial review, I've been back three times. I've discovered that their mint yogurt dip appetizer is delicious as well as their lentil soup (which I'm told is completely vegetarian- no chicken broth)! I've been pretty unoriginal and ordered falafel or lentil soup and an appetizer each visit; I still need to try their baklava. I believe the owner has greeted us each time we dined and asked how our meals were and the staff are very outgoing.",

My wrap was chock full of chickpea, sesame and pickled goodness all for $4 + tax. The flavor is good enough to convince me I don't need to drive all the way down to Sharon Amity every time I have a Mediterranean craving.   Where Le Kebab Grill does slack a little is the service. The gentleman in charge is awesome and attentive, but his counter help isn't always on the ball (or at the counter) and they forgot to add the hot sauce I ordered to my wrap (which I might not have minded if it weren't $.59 extra). Maybe over time they will get with the program or maybe its just a case of college-help-itis. Le Kebab Grill is a welcome addition to the Grand Promenade Shopping Center.",

But my concern was; i was shocked to see the chef !!! nabil working here and announcing him as the owner. the guy is only working 3-4 months at any restaurant and always being fired. the food is so so he was doing better in la shish kabob. the name is funny though. He used to work for la shish kabob 4 months ago. Kabob grill is known by every charlotean lebanese food lovers. And he tricked the name by mixing both. How original!!!! He is trying to get advantages of kabob grill name.",

Having lived overseas in the Middle East multiple times, I can say that without a doubt it's as close to authentic as I've found here in the QC.  Nabil (I think?) the owner, is really eager to please and want's people to try out everything he's got.  He might be a little over the top, but I'd rather see a little passion go too far then the converse.    The hummus was fresh and a huge portion, the pita came in little plastic bags which seemed odd, but tasted great and didn't really bother me, just made the presentation a little weak, but again it was it's first few weeks.  I had the shwarma, which was clean, fresh tasting and well assembled.  And the key, it had fries in it! I can tell you that in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, etc they almost always had fries in them so that's the way that I love them. Anyway, it was filling and made me think of my days back east.  All in all a great find on the north side of town that I'll frequent again as soon as I can,",

So personable, welcoming, funny, charismatic and she gave us a run for our money with jokes and puns. I ordered a spinach pie for an appetizer, a gyro and chicken kebab which came with fries and a salad for my entree (I was really hungry), and to finish it off with dessert, baklava and rice pudding. Everything was incredible. I am Greek so I am very picky about my Greek food. I was fully expecting to not like it much. I have been spoiled by authentic Greek food while visiting family in Athens, Greece. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the spinach pie. It did not have any cheese in it and the spinach they use has a slight bitter taste to it. Other than that, everything tasted very comparable to the real thing. I have visited Athens, Greece many times and no restaurant here can beat it, but this place is a very close second to the real thing. I recently went to a Greek/Italian restaurant in south Charlotte that was okay. Much more expensive than this place. The food at Le Kebab Grill knocked the food at the other place out of the park and came in at about a third of the cost. I will definitely be going back. Best middle eastern/Mediterranean food I've had since Athens, Greece!!!!!! I can't say it enough. BEST MIDDLE EASTERN AND MEDITERRANEAN FOOD YOU WILL HAVE IN CHARLOTTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Meanwhile there we're 2 tables available. One in the front by the door and outside. I just was ready to go. The \"owner\" the tried to make me stay. I just wanted to leave. She then followed me out the restaurant and still tried to make me stay. She caused a scene when there was really no problem. I just didn't want to eat there anymore.

And our waiter was just about the nicest, friendliest, smile-ist person I've ever met. Maybe because he eats there all the time and it makes you happy?  I got the kofta (beef and lamb) kebabs, and the fella got the chicken kebabs. We were just boring enough to get the same two sides, too - rice pilaf and steamed veggies. He liked my meat better than his, and I liked his meat better than mine, so we gave each other one of our two kebabs. His chicken sauce was like a spicy, Crisco, and my sauce was tzatziki but a little thinner than I'm used to. The rice was almost sweet... and I ate almost all of it.  All of that was only $21 (we both got waters), and the service can't be beat. Awesome place!",

I ordered the lamb over hummus and a tabouleh.  I was a bit surprised at the price (close to $20) but once I saw the portion I understood.  I was told that they didn't have any more tabouleh and was over the fattoush salad.  Sure, I'll try it.  After about 7 minutes my order was ready and the owner appeared and said that he made a tabouleh salad for me which is what took so long ( 7 minutes is not so long at all sir!). He also told me to keep the fattoush salad at no extra charge and tell him what I think of each.... how nice! The owner spoke briefly about their plans for expansion of the location and was very nice. The tabouleh was very tasty with the right amount of acid and it was served with a Meyer lemon which added a nice touch of sweet and bitter.  It was the best tabouleh I've had.  I wasn't crazy about the fattoush.  It just wasn't my jam... the lamb over hummus wasn't bad although next time I might try it over chicken.... yes there will be a next time!",

    "text": "Just the smell of grilled meat alone will pull you into Le Kebab Grill.  My coworker and I walked in on a Friday night and found the place crowded, but still with plenty of tables to accommodate the many parties that were waiting to be seated. Our waitress for the night was Ketty who has to be one of the nicest waitresses we have ever met. She was so meticulous when it came to explaining the menu, especially when we had some questions about the items. She came by often to check on us, always polite and always asking us if we needed anything. At one point, my coworker had a question about what vegetable his soup was made out of and she quickly went into the kitchen to ask the chef before coming out and explaining to us what it was. Just Ketty's service alone deserves five stars.  But I'm happy to report that the food at Le Kebab Grill is worth boasting about as well. Before we had even got a chance to order food, Ketty brought out a complimentary platter of two falafels, hummus, pita bread, and house chips. There was so much food! Even though there was plenty to have as a starter, my coworker and I also got the combination platter with falafels (so good we had to order more), labaneh (a yogurt cheese to eat with pita bread), and stuffed grape leaves. The yalanji was super light to have and definitely helped us meet our daily vegetables serving for the day. The labaneh complimented the hummus well, especially with the soft pita bread.  Even though I was already quite full, I still ordered the gyro plate that consisted of thinly sliced and grilled lamb and beef with a side of tzatziki sauce as well as a side of lentil soup. The lamb and beef were combined into lightly grilled slices of meat that reminded me a lot of bacon without all the fat. I loved eating it with the pita bread and the tzatziki sauce that added a touch of tang and creaminess.   As for the soup, I've never had lentil soup before so I didn't really know what to expect. I wasn't too fond of the puree-like texture and there was a slight bitter aftertaste. However, I could definitely taste the fresh ingredients and the soup was delightfully light.  Good food and phenomenal service from Ketty easily made Le Kebab Grill one of the most memorable spots for dinner for my stay here in North Carolina. The food was flavorful, the portions were gigantic, and the service was absolutely welcoming.   Let's go back!",

    "text": "Le Kebab Grill serves hot, fresh Middle Eastern food that I'd put against any restaurant of similar cuisine in the area.  For our appetizer, we got the sampler plate with falafel, hummus, and yalanji.  The yalanji was soft and delicate with an excellent flavor.  The falafel was expertly fried and perfectly seasoned, and their hummus was delicious and as smooth as it could be.  It was the perfect prequel to our entrees.  I got the Kofta Kebab plate with an extra skewer of kofta, and for my sides I chose tabouleh and rice pilaf.  The kebab itself was amazing...they must use charcoal in their grill because it has a delicious smoky flavor and is perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The tabouleh is tasty and refreshing, though slightly overdressed.  There was basically a puddle of lemon juice in the bottom of the bowl, so I couldn't quite finish all of it as it'd be too overwhelming.  After the starter and my entree, however, I didn't have room for it so I'm not going to take off a whole star for this one tiny misstep.  The rice pilaf was perfectly seasoned, delicious, and there was a metric ton of it on the plate.  Le Kebab Grill is an excellent restaurant and a great value.  It's fast, casual, and high quality.  If we lived in the area, I'm sure we'd be here a lot more but it's well worth the trip and we definitely stop in when we're in the area.",

The chicken in my wrap was dry and the garlic mayo really overpowers any other flavor that may have existed in my wrap. I'd much rather have something light like Tzatziki. Now I did get some on the side and for some reason the consistency was like mayo whereas someone at my table had the same but the consistency of hers was creamy salad dressing like. I don't know... maybe mine was thawed out recently. Anyway, I wanted to make sure we had the same thing. When I tasted hers, it was very tart and just unpleasant; and mine was just okay.   The fries were meh. Again, I'm a fry connoisseur and these just weren't hittin it.   The falafel was off today I guess cause I make better ones at home. I'm not trying to be harsh but there wasn't any freshness to it. I thought maybe some Tzatziki would help, but nah. I had 6 balls. Took a bite of one and didn't have anymore. I should have asked them to take if off my bill.   Now the service was top notch. I was with a big group and the waiter was extremely attentive and kind. I feel like we were all trying to do something different with our food and he wasn't impatient are annoyed but really helpful. He offered some good suggestions for others and he was accommodating for us all.   Someone I was with commented that she wasn't feeling the place either and recommended another Mediterranean joint to me. Maybe it was an off day? I don't know.   I can't say I'll be back but I'm grateful for the attempt.",

    "text": "I loved this place when I first found it here in the university area, my go to on the east side is La Shish Kabob for a mediterranean fix. The first few times dinning in were good, I built up the confidence to order takeout. I say built up because i n my experience to-go does not get the same attention as dine in, I thought this place would be different, it is not. Lamb mandi was something I enjoyed here, it cost about $16 you get a lot of rice and a few nice pieces of lamb shank.   I've ordered this multiple (foolish)times to-go thinking that maybe it was just a bad night until on one instance I took the food back in side and pointed out that I had been giving a plate of mostly bone. The ppl there looked at me like I was crazy and they justified a plate of fucking bones with \"we weight the meat\", there were 2 pieces of lamb the size of chicken nuggets atop a sea of rice surrounded by lamb joints, not meat. Also on those same visits I was served salads with brown lettuce. The discrepancy in service is ridiculous and when the customer mentions he wants what he's paying for there should not be hissing and rolled eyes in a foreign tongue followed by reluctantly \"correcting\" the mistake from ppl who are in the service industry working with food.   I may have some run on sentences here.   But the point is if you have time to drive to central avenue, do it and visit La Shish Kabob. For the same price as the lamb mandi you can get there 2 shank lamb plate, which is actually TWO WHOLE LAMB SHANKS and it comes with a soup or salad for about $17. Le Kabob charges extra for the soup or salad and doesn't respond well to their mistakes being pointed out, Le Shish Kabob hasn't made a mistake yet. I drove 25 min past Le Kabob to go visit this place last night and was reminded of how worth it it was.  If this place works for you cool, if not, visit La Shish Kabob on central ave.",

The dish was delicious! Hummus didn't have a ton of flavor but he lamb and chicken had plenty to make up for it. Add some of their hot sauce and its a wonderful meal!  Pita bread was just ok, only reason I wouldn't give it 5. Will return again.  I see a lot of complaints on here about time to get food, I ordered to go around 2pm and it took 7-8 minutes to come out so not bad at all.",

    "text": "First time here....always looking for good places before my French language classes up in the University Area. And it won't be my last time!  Started with the Falaffel balls, with a delicious Tahini sauce. Very tasty and well seasoned. Due to the Yelp reviews, I tried the Lamb Shawarma which came with 2 sides, so I opted for their very delicious Lentil Soup (everyone who reviewed this was indeed correct - YUMMY) and the yellow basmati rice. The lamb didn't have any \"funk\" in it that it CAN have (at less than reputable establishments) and it was very delicious. A little \"odd\" in that they were small strips and not \"Greek Gyro-like\" in thicker strips....but boy do they give you a LOT of it. My only criticism is that the tahini sauce, which was the same they served with the Falaffel, didn't seem to go with the Lamb. A yogurt based sauce (like Tzatziki) would go better with the Lamb. But the lamb itself was delicious by itself.  And just because I'm a Hummus Junkie, I had to leave with a side of their Hummus. I had it for breakfast the next day and it was very good! I'd personally like a tad more garlic in it but hey, it was very creamy and delicious.  Oh, the staff and my server were all SUPER nice and friendly, and made sure my experience was a great one. It was. And when she found out it was my first time there, she threw in a Baklava for free. And it was very yummy as well!  Overall a really great place for Simple but DELICIOUS Mediterranean food. Definitely a place to check out! For those of you on the South Side of Charlotte (like me), check out Jasmine Grill on South Blvd, which is just as good if not better than Le Kebob!",

Decorated nicely and had traditional eastern music playing softly. The friendly staff was smiling, warm and inviting. The food was very \"clean\", and perfectly seasoned. The veg too, very fresh. We had a bowl of yogurt dip and some pita while we we deciding on our order, also very nice. The marinated and grilled chicken was really good and the bread used for the Philly cheesesteak made it a cheesesteak to remember. You should try an experience here, it was tasty.",

    "text": "The food at Le Kebab Grill is great! Everything tastes extremely fresh.   Appetizers - The hummus is absolutely delicious! Lots of fresh soft pita bread. If you love hummus there is really no comparison when you get delicious fresh made hummus versus the stuff you get at the store.   Lunch Special - You can get a skewer and two sides for a reasonable price. I usually opt for the kofta skewer, lentil soup and a salad. The lentil soup is very good. The salad comes with a delicious oil and lemon juice dressing that is very light and fresh.   I have also had the gyro wrap and french fries. The gyro wrap is very good, the meat is soft and tender. The fries are crinkle cut.   Service seems to be hit or miss here. Some of the servers are extremely friendly and helpful. Other times you get a server who seems like they just walked in off the street and aren't really sure what's going on. Also some servers are very good about timing what comes out when with your order and others not so much. Today our waitress was awful. Only came to one side of the table and asked us to pass food and pass our glasses for her to refill. It just was bizarre, like she didn't realize she could walk around to the side of the table. She also brought out french fries about 10 mins before our entrees.   One take away when you look around at other patrons in a restaurant is if the ethnicity of the food they're serving matches that of the patrons - when I visit this restaurant there are always middle eastern patrons. This tells me that the food must be pretty authentic and GOOD!",

About a month ago, my girlfriend and I went there during lunch time at noon and it seemed pretty busy so while taking our time, we felt rushed, even though it was our first time there and was deciding what to order. The table we had was really small to where we better finish our appetizer before our entree gets there or we'll have no space to put them; the place itself was pretty packed in and tight. Definitely worth trying but do pick a good time to go in to eat.  P.S. Now to the single men out there, there's a beautiful hostess who works there so put your game on and see if she's single.",

We arrived to find the atmosphere nice and the place busy, even at about 9pm. The clientele seemed to be the types interested in something authentic. Plus, in the University area, they were expecting a good deal.  We started with the falafel appetizer, and we both really enjoyed it. Very tasty.  My wife ordered the mixed kebab - three kebabs on rice with mixed veggies. I ordered the Turkish kebab with the rice and the lentil soup. We both highly recommend the soup. It was delicious, and we'll be making it ourselves in the future.  The kebabs were all cooked very well. Seasoned and spiced very well, and very tasty. The rice was light and very flavorful. The only miss of the meal were the mixed veggies - apparently a nod to western tastes. Avoid them and get something that comes from the Mediterranean.   The service was pleasant, and the place stayed busy. Overall, this is the best kebab/Mediterranean meal we've had in Charlotte, and we highly recommend it.",

    "text": "So last night I headed out to Le Kabab for the annual iftar buffet that the have during the fasting. I have frequented this restaurant for years, so I was really looking forward to it. Typically, the food is decent and consistent. I have been to several middle eastern countries and eaten a wide variety of dishes that come from the region, so I am quite familiar. For the most part, Le Kabab is pretty average. Compared to other Middle East restaurants in town, they are one of the better ones. However, last night the food and service was terrible. From being discouraged from dining in because the place was crowded, to the waitress that didn't check on me, bring me water and flat out refused to clean the dirty table. When I was being seated I sat my bag down to go to the buffet and and asked \"can you clean the table, it still looks dirty?\" She mumbled something which at the time didn't matter to me as I was very hungry and who isn't going to honor your request at a restaurant and NOT clean a table that was CLEARLY DIRTY. Once I returned to the table, I was so shocked to see that she never cleaned it. So I waited for her to come back. I wasn't going to be rude but I was flaming mad. At that point, another waiter comes and as me what I wanted to drink. When he came back with water, I just cleaned the table myself and decided to get over eat and just enjoy the food. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Bland pieces of fatty lamb, chicken kabobs that could have cooked longer, and more unfavorable side dishes. Buffet food should be quickly replenished and not left until empty. I recently found another Arabic restaurant in town and that will be my go to spot in the future. Best wishes to the establishment but I am moving on from here.",

I've received bigger pieces of steak from the mall Mediterranean place  in DC. The rice had a weird taste , the pita bread was cold and served in a plastic bag.

I wanted more, either more portion, more of a particular sauce, and/or more of a particular flavor.  I can't put my finger on it but I think this place has 5 stars hidden in it with a particular tweak.  I wish I had the inspiration to let you and the owners know what to do, but this is why I don't run a 5 star restaurant, that and I don't have a passion for running a restaurant.  My advice is to try this place out without expecting too much, and also don't have a lot riding on the event.  Such as a critical second date with someone you really like.  I might recommend going with some laid back people that like everything.  Then you can try multiple dishes and figure out the solution to me ennui with regard to Le Kebab.  3 Stars from me is still a good rating, if you look at my profile I am not stingy with the 1s and 2s, not because I am crabby but because I try a lot of places once that in hindsight you should try zero times.  This is not a try zero times place.",

We had an awesome waiter named Basher, who answered all of our questions and was very knowledgable about the menu.  They were even nice enough to customize our meal for us.  We wanted to try the fattoush and tabbouleh but didn't really want the big huge salads, so they gave us smaller portions for a smaller price!  I love flexible places!  All of the food was AMAZING!  We got the lentil soup (warm, hearty, and yummy!  great for the cold evening!) a small side of Tabbouleh, very well seasoned, a small side of  fattoush, also very well seasoned, (many places i have had it, it is too bland), and a Lamb Shawerma Wrap.  We asked them not to wrap the wrap up so we could take pictures, and they were very obliging!  Let me just say I have never been a fan of lamb, but this was AMAZING!  I would definatly get it again.  It was well seasoned and yummy!  Especially with the tahini sauce.  I've had tahini sauce other places and it is, often too tart, but here it was smooth and flavorful without being too tart.  And then we ended with some mint tea.  Also very nice on a cool evening.  I am looking forward to going  back here again!  The prices are very reasonable and they aren't skimpy with their portions.  Staff was very friendly.  Service and food were both 5 star!",

My top favorite things are  -Grilled Chicken Entree  -Lentil Soup (if something I order comes with 2 sides, I usually get double soup because it's that good) -KUSHAREE (this is why I'm writing the review) it's their Monday special. I'm not sure if they have it available other days of the week but they should! It's a vegetarian dish (possibly vegan, you'd have to ask to confirm). It has lentils, some macaroni noodles and lots of flavorful rice into a single dish. It comes with a mildly spicy sauce (it comes on the side so you can control it... I used it all). Plus, it is topped with caramelized onions. YUM! My husband who lives and dies by animal protein regretted not getting this. I'm a self-proclaimed flexiatarian and participate in meat-free Mondays so I'm glad it was last night's special.  We usually do take-out because they don't serve alcohol which I'm assuming is due to religious/cultural reasons but I WISH THEY DID!!! As a suggestion, I think they should offer beer and wine, at least, and then those who do not partake can abstain but those of us who would like to wash down our Kusharee with some cold beer could do so in the restaurant rather than at home. In the meantime, I will keep ordering out and going to Food & Wine in the same plaza before heading home.",

The baba ghanouj was flavorful and a very generous portion was brought out - enough that I needed more pita bread. The wrap was good - it also included lettuce, tomato, and tahini sauce.  Friend ordered the gyro entree - the presentation was a little unexpected but the flavors were good and with 2 sides included, it was a satisfying portion.  The server was friendly and attentive.

Basher did a great job greeting us as we walked in, serving us and answering questions!

Harris Boulevard.    Parking is plentiful due to the many stores and restaurants nearby.  However, it does tend to fill up around dinner time - especially during Fri-Sun nights.  My recommendation would be to arrive a bit early before dinner to get a closer parking spot and a seat near the windows.  The inside decor of Le Kebab Grill is fantastic.  The restaurant features many Middle Eastern pieces hanging off of the walls and even has a section with tacked up currencies from around the world.  Light Arab music gives an elevated atmosphere.  Classy place.    The staff are gracious and willing to regularly check up on you throughout your dining experience.  The food itself is solid.  Exceptional flavor, healthy, and with sizeable quantities.  Keep in mind - the food can take some time as most dishes are prepared fresh - order some appetizers while you wait.  The pricing is fair, especially for the quality, atmosphere, and amount you get per dish.  Le Kebab Grill is one of the best Middle Eastern eateries in Charlotte.  If you haven't checked it out yet, you're missing out - big time.",

The service was quick, the atmosphere was active and multicultural (hey, it's a college campus) and to top it all off, the portions were large and fairly priced. It's a no-brainer, this is where you want to go.",

My husband and I decided to grab dinner before going to the movies and looking on Yelp this place came out with good reviews and one dollar sign for the price.  We got sat right away and the waitress was very attentive.  They have some decent options but definitely were not just one dollar sign place.  The place was clean and didn't take too long for the food to come but I was impressed with the food at all. Specially because my meal, for my standards, was not a big of a deal. I had a gyro plate and my husband had a phillycheese steak. My husband enjoyed his food a lot but unfortunately I can't say the same about mine.  I had a salad as side with lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers. The tomatoes were old, they were white looking and really soft.  My steamed veggies looked like the ones you get frozen from de grocery store and the tatziki sauce was the worst I've ever had in my life. The only thing good was the meat and the pita bread. It cost me $15 for a meal that I could eat 1/3.  Unfortunately this is some place I won' go back.",

Definitely recommend the lamb kabobs or the half grilled chicken (both served with yellow rice).",

We were quickly sat in the crowded restaurant. Our server was prompt. We ordered the Kibbeh for an appetizer. Crispy kibbeh with warm bits of lamb inside. Very flavorful and aromatic. I ordered the Falafel pita and my partner had the shawarma with lamb and chicken. Additionally I noted it being Saturday their special was a fried chicken, I also ordered this. For my side I chose the chicken vegetable soup. The soup was perfectly simple. Tomato broth with fresh vegetables and bits of chicken. Definitely homemade. The chicken was good. Crispy and hot!  Fresh out of the fryer. Our sandwiches were also good. Oddly enough the date of the show was the garlic mayonnaise!!  This was so delicious we dipped everything in it; fries, chicken, sandwiches. Will definitely return. Very friendly staff.",

There are a lot of cheap options on the menu and they give you a big proportion! The hummus is amazing!!! You have to try! I don't usually like hummus, but this one is a must. I believe I got shawarma chicken with the yellow rice. It was very filling and the white sauce that come with it makes it taste even better. I got a salad as the side, but the dressing was a bit too much. I couldn't even eat more than two bites of the salad because of that. Besides the salad, I would recommend eating everything! Its amazing! Trust me. I'm not a big Mediterranean person but somehow this place got me.",

I ordered the chicken kabobs with rice pilaf and steamed veggies. It also came with a little bit of garlic sauce ( wish it was more sauce). The food was pretty good the chicken could of been a little more tender.  My love had the falafel pita and some lentil soup. He loved the pita so much he went back the next night to get another one. I also tried it, it was pretty good and the portion was a good size.  We would more than likely go back again!",

    "text": "I was in the area and this place popped up as one of the top Mediterranean spots in town, so I rushed over knowing how much I loved lamb over rice and shwarmas. My experience was not as good as I was hoping, but it wasn't necessarily bad either.   Service:  Service was good, but understaffed as it was extremely busy. The servers are extremely nice and have great knowledge of the menu. They'll make a custom order with just about anything without really breaking a sweat.  Food: Here's where I got some disappointments. I ordered the lamb over rice with a lentil soup * Falafels. The falafels were pretty good, the soup not so much, with the lamb being fairly dry. I got some garlic sauce on the side which really brought out the flavor of the lamb over rice. However, if I didn't order it regularly from other Mediterranean places, I would've been really disappointed with me meal.  Venue: Very nice venue that seats a surprisingly large amount of people (even if it does look small). Extremely clean with plenty of room, has a very charlotte-esque feel.  Overall, I believe this place is extremely overhyped, maybe because there's a lack of good Mediterranean food around the area. Overall, I might come back but only to try a sandwich.",

The restaurant was packed, but we got lucky and snagged a table close to the front.  They also have outside seating and the full menu is also available to go.  We started our meal with Hummus and Pita.  The Hummus was fresh and we were given a hearty portion.  There was a red pepper swirl through it which was awesome!  I got the chicken Gyro made with the chicken that is off of the swirling meat roaster.  haha I do not remember the proper name!  I do not eat Lamb though the traditonal gyro looked great.  The portion was huge and it came with one side for around $8.  My boyfriend got a Kabob meal with rice.  He loved it and said this place is going to be one of his regular spots.    The acutal meal did take awhile....I'm not sure if we looked ancy or what but one of the chefs hand-delivered us a dipping sauce for free  because of the wait, which was delicious!  You can tell this place is family-owned and everyone was incredibly friendly.  We will be back!",

I was informed that the wait staff was unusually irritable because of fasting and I can totally understand because I fast as well. The owner shared that he loves seeing people enjoy his food and that he never wants customers to feel unwelcome. Le Kabob is back in good graces with me and I will definitely be back! ...  The service here is the absolute worst!  My first encounter with their terrible service was at an end of year dinner for my student org. 20 of us came to Le Kabob and throughout the dinner the waitress, a middle aged woman, kept harassing us. She first complained that nearby tables called us loud, which, after further investigation, turned out to be a lie. She brought out her coworker to yell at us but he confirmed we were doing nothing wrong. At one point two of the girls at the table were talking to eachother and giggling and she told them to stop laughing!?! Another girl got up to use the bathroom and the waitress told her to sit down. This whole experience was so embarrassing for the entire organization. I would implore you all to avoid bringing large groups here.   Then, last night, another waiter ended up waiting on my family. We asked to sit outside but he appeared to be dissatisfied with our request. We ended up sitting inside to please him but that did not result in better service. He often forgot to check on us and the food took a lot longer than usual to arrive. He brought out the incorrect order for my sister and tried to get her to eat it instead of making the correct dish. He eventually did bring her the correct food and allowed her to keep the first dish. Either way she ended up waiting over an hour to eat. Furthermore my cousin's to go order was completely burnt but she felt so intimidated all evening, she did not have the heart to bring it up.",

My dish was the mixed grill and it lacked the one thing I love about middle eastern food, spices and natural flavor.  :-/   The chicken skewer was the best of the three.  The rice was short grain rice mixed with butter... eww?!   Is that common in middle eastern food?  From my experiences, a light fluffy basmati rice is much better.    The house dressing for the salad was bland, not fresh lemon flavor as anticipated.    So, in the words of the American Idol judge, Randy, \"it was just alright for me dog!\"  The staff however, was spectacular.  On point!  Friendly! Genuine! And well trained and instinctively caring a kind.    If I lived local, I would certainly try again, but stick to kabob me thinks!",

Since spicy food upsets my stomach next time I'll see if they have a milder version of the chicken. Although it was spicy it was really good. But the star was that rice pilaf!! So tasty. The salad was rather ordinary but it was good to have some freshness with the meal. My platter was a whopping $14 with tax!! I thought that was rather much until I realized I could eat from it for four days. That really made it worth every penny.  Overall, my food was good and the portion size was outrageous!!

I settled on the chicken souvlaki pita, and my dad got a gyro. We also got hummus as an appetizer.   They bring you fried pita bread with the drinks. As for the food, you get incredible portion sizes. The homemade hummus is brought out on a plate, and honestly, it rivals Sabra hummus in portion (their hummus is MUCH better, and I love Sabra!).

I really wanted to try the falafels but I recently made my own and still have some left over so I felt I'd be cheating on my own falafels...I'll try their another time.  I ordered the chicken shawarma without the rice with sauteed veggies and a salad for myself. I really wanted the rice but, carbs. I also ordered the Baba Ghanouj....it was NOTHING I expected. I've heard the name of the dish several times, so I thought I'd try it. I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich with fries for my son.  I basically inhaled everything. I started with some of the fries because they looked so golden and crispy. My son loved the cheesesteak so that was a winner. I think there could've been more veggies considering I didn't get the rice, but they were more steamed than sauteed. The actual chicken shawarma came with red onions and banana peppers and a garlic \"sauce\". The sauce wasn't very saucy. It was more like the consistency of cottage cheese so there was no pouring it over the chicken. However, it was good! I will ask for extra next time. The Baba Ghanouj came with a side of pita. It was very good. I actually think I've probably had it before, just didn't know that's what it was. I probably thought it was hummus. I have yet to eat the salad but it's a basic salad so I'm sure I'll enjoy it.  I am definitely going back and I'm getting rice next time.",

First off, I must say the staff are really patient and always take time to answer my questions and make suggestions. Along with the regular menu, they have daily specials that are posted inside the restaurant, so if you're calling in an order ask what the daily special is.  I love the cauliflower salad with tahini sauce, it's lightly fried, very simple but delicious.  The beef kebab is another favorite, served over mixed rice is seasoned really well and melts in your mouth......again very simple but really good.  The menu is pretty extensive and there are so many other things I plan to try along with some of the suggestions made by the staff.",

I was not impressed with the fries this trip. They didn't seem full cooked so didn't really enjoy them.   That is why I gave a four vs a five. This is one of my favorite Charlotte spots. The food is flavorful and filling as well as worth the money. I look forward to coming back and having this again.",

I ordered something simple, the Philly Cheese Steak with French Fries. It was decent but not something I haven't had before. It was just a standard Philly. My wife had Gyro plate. She didn't seem too impressed with it at all. For starters, she did not enjoy her salad, well the dressing mainly. She even stated the tomatoes were very bitter.   Looking back, I feel like I should have ordered a Kebab plate, but we weren't trying to spend a lot for lunch that day. If we ever end up back here, I'll make sure to try one of those out and update my review then. But, as of now, with the food that we ordered, we didn't think this place was that good.",

After spending way to much at Ashley hunger hit and of course wanted something affordable and delicious.  What a gem this spot was. The food was great, service amazing and overall affordable. I ended up getting the Lamb chops, chicken veggie soup with an unsweet tea which again was amazing. I ordered it medium but it came out more well done but overall the char on it was perfect. The boo ordered the chicken kabob with a side of grilled veggies which again just great. I did think they gave way to much of the rice which was delicious. Never thought I would be saying to much food but it was a bit much but very tasty. The hummus was yeah yeah yeah I've said it before but it was delicious and tasted fresh the olive oil and chick peas was a nice touch.  We'll definitely be coming here again when we're in the area. I don't recall my waiters name but he was very tall, nice curly black hair and darker skinned. I don't know the last time I've received that type of service without it being a 4-5 restaurant.  If you're on the fence between this Le Kabob and another spot, I would highly recommend this place.",

Without any apology or even welcome she just asked how many?! And she told me \"wait here to check if there is a place\". After another 3 or 4 minutes waiting, Another lady noticed I'm still standing. She grabbed a menu and asked me to follow her. When I entered I found the first girl was talking to one of her coworkers. Hello. The place wasn't even busy. Exactly 16 minutes later until someone got my order.",

    "text": "Yelp world, I'm back! After a multi year hiatus because of grad school, I'm excited to start Yelping again.  On a road trip thru Charlotte, my husband and I were craving gyros since we've been eating Mediterranean food this month. This happened to be close to the highway and had high reviews.  OVERALL: 4.5 Le Kebab is a solid casual Mediterrean restaurant in Charlotte that prepares savory meats and fresh vegetables into traditional halal recipes.   FOOD: 5 We ordered the gyro wrap and chicken mandi, both of which were fantastic. The gyro wrap had a fluffy pita with savory slices of lamb and beef gyro, plenty of lettuce and tomatoes, onion and tzatziki sauce. It tasted like a more fresh version instead of a greasy gyro that you'd find from a state fair food truck. But the chicken mandi was the star of the show. The chicken was so tender and had great flavor on the skin and with the sauces. And that yellow mandi rice was so flavorful yet light. We need to learn how to make that rice because I'm still dreaming about it.   SERVICE: 4.5 Our server was super attentive and would bring extra plates proactively and clear plates when they were full of bones and napkins. The only thing is I wish he were a bit more knowledgeable about how things were cooked. He couldn't tell us what went into the sauces or which spices were used for the rice. But if we needed anything, he was on top of it!   ATMOSPHERE: 4 Pretty standard for a one dollar sign restaurant that brings food out very quickly. The restaurant was clean and had a fun wall of money bills from all around the world. There were pamphlets up front as well for people interested in learning more about Islam. This spot would be perfect for a work lunch, or just whenever you're craving really good authentic Mediterranean food.   PARKING: 5 Plenty of parking in the front since it belongs to a bigger complex.  Charlotte is lucky to be blessed with such an establishment. Next time I want to try the chicken shawarma and lamb mandi along with some dessert.",

I recommend the Lamb Mandi, one of the specials. It comes with yellow rice, cucumber sauce, and a spicy pepper sauce (all of which are lovely). Their appetizers are delicious. This is a great place to try out food you haven't had before. They have Greek, Turkish, Halal, veggie, you name it!  During the warmer months, they also offer hookah outdoors. The staff sets it up for you. You get a large, somewhat nondescript hookah with a few coals on tin foil. I believe wind screens are available if necessary. I'm not judging the restaurant for the quality of the shisha they use, but I will say that it has been hit or miss. I would say to steer clear of the pomegranate flavor. It is dull and tasteless. Other than that, the staff is helpful and will get you extra coals if you need them.",

If you are looking for a hidden gem, I definitely recommend this place. The food consistent along with great prices. I love to know that every time I go there, I am going to a great meal. It is hands down easily one of my favorite restaurants.   I would it if there was location on the south side of Charlotte! I live in the area of this restaurant but I work in south Charlotte. There are days I would love to have it for lunch but since it is so far away, I cannot. I definitely have not been impressed with other middle eastern places that are close to my work as I have been with this place.   One thing I would note is for dinner time during Ramadan you should consider carry out if you pressed for time. Since they prepare for a feast at sundown, the dine in service time is not as good as it is during any other time you would go there. My kids can get impatient having to wait longer than usual, so we just do carry out to avoid that during that time of the year.",

However, I didn't see any take out menus.  The place looks legit tho. I have been waiting to eat some good Mediterranean food.  I got my food, here's the after thoughts:  It didn't take me that long of the wait.  I ordered hummus, fattoush, and gyro combination plate.  The food was ok.  From the time I got my food and back to my hotel, was probably less than 10 minutes.  The fattoush was very soggy, as if it's been sitting in the dressing for a long time.  The rice that came with the gyro was very soft and soggy as well.  Not sure if the rice is done how they like it or it's a mistake.  I have never had soft and soggy rice at other Mediterranean restaurant.  The hummus was good and I like the gyro.  The price of the food is a very good bargain.  If you want some cheap, ok taste Mediterranean food, this is not a bad place to be.",

There wasn't a single dish cooked properly, extremely dry chicken, chewy tough beef, fried items were cold and soggy.  Sterno was out on all of the dishes so it was all cold.  None of the buffet items that were out were getting replenished, and there were several.  They told us the buffet goes until 10:30 and we got there at 9:50 so there was no excuse for empty buffet items, especially when the kitchen was still open which it clearly was because they were still taking orders from other tables and food was coming out of the window.  Service was non existent, every server was sitting around, you had to go up to them and interrupt their conversation to ask for a glass of water.  All for 15 bucks...this place is garbage, will never go back.",

Tonight  I went with my friend's family who have never eaten Middle Eastern food before (I am used to eat this type of food back home). My friend's family absolutely LOVED IT. The restaurant was easy to find. It was clean and the best part is that the food WAS NOT PRICEY AT ALL. Our server, Brittany, was SO GREAT in everything! The owner came to our table and talked to us. He was very nice to talk to and also generous to our table. We ordered the combination platter for appetizer and it was DELICIOUS (Yilanji, baba ghanouj, and falafel with pita bread). We had the baked chicken, Turkish Kebab, mandi lamb with rice, and lamb shawarma plate. We also had homemade chicken soup and lentil soup. We shared everything because I wanted my friend's family to try different kinds of food. They all LOVED EVERY PLATE!    If they are ever in town again, they will definitely come back. I am definitely coming back again to this wonderful restaurant.   Please keep up this excellent quality of work!",

I was in town for only two days and only wanted to try local eats. (No chains). Unfortunately I never got to try the food.  After the waiter took our order (very good service ) which was good to say. The table next to us had a ceiling tile fall straight in the middle of the table hitting a women in the head and broke into hundred pieces. What looked to me as if the ceiling tile that was saturated by the water sweat from the A/C vent had given way and came crashing down on top of this innocent women. What also came down were \"PALMETTO BUGS aka ROACHES\". Which scattered the floor and all over the table and floor. At that point the managers were running around to try to step on them and contain the situation. These bugs were BIG!  We took our belongings and were walking out when the waiter offered us to move our table. Let's just put it this way I quickly lost my appetite.",

Then I asked one the staff for a cup of fruit they had and she went inside to get me ..meanwhile the men staff who spoiled my day came and told we don't have anything left inside but I know there are lots of fruits they kept inside. On the  counter when I paid I said what had happened and that gentleman went inside again to bring me some. But this time again that person who said nothing left again came to me and asked sarcastically do u guys have any problem as if he does know anything ..I noticed they had a conversation inside in front of me on what I asked. Attest if they don't have the fruits they should got us something and said sorry. I was waiting for few mins and finally no one came and I ended up paying 50 dollars for 3 buffets. We dint really eat anything and went for another restaurant with hunger. I will never go to this place in my life time. If anyone from the store wants to discuss call me at 201-245-1315. I recommend no one go Ther and there are plenty of Middle East restaurants which are really good. Plz try those Instead of this. Thanks",

First off the falafel was delicious and piping hot, the labaneh wast tangy thick and cool the baba gnoush had an odd aftertaste neither of us cared for. The pitas did come in little ziplocs which was not an issue but the strong refrigerator taste on them was it distracted from the flavors of the dips. After ordering our Gyros I asked if it came with anything I was told no but I could add fries which I was going to do but the waiter told me the gyro was very large so I decided against it. Now let me qualify my review of the gyro by saying I have eaten and loved gyros since I could walk, I have been looking for a good gyro shop here for a while and have had to settle for just ok....that being said this gyro was not very good. it was really low on toppings, based on what the waiter said it felt almost like the cook only made one gyro then instead of making another just split the meat and veggies between the two. The meat was not 100% meat there were obviously a lot of fillers. It left a lot to be desired I may go back but more than likely I wont.",

I had the lamb shawarma which is very good with the taziki and garlic sauce. But word to the wise. please zero out your tip when tipping cash or ordering takeout from this place.

They were very funny and pretty much required me to try a sample to taste because they thought it was something I would not be familiar with and therefore I might not like it. But, with lamb and yogurt you basically can not go wrong. It smelled fantastic. The lamb was nicely cooked and the sauce managed to be creamy and tangy, almost lemony, at the same time.

    "text": "We were so glad to find this place in the University area! Charlotte needs more Middle Eastern restaurants. We had the falafel, mixed grill plate and hummus for two, which was more than enough food. It was all really, really good. You can't beat perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked kebabs and keftas. I want to try the lamb next time. The service was great as well. Only complaint was the music was loud and the CD was skipping or something which was driving me crazy. But I will definitely be back. They have a bunch of wraps and sandwiches as well. Reasonably priced, we got out for about $24.",

    "text": "Overlooked and under appreciated hole in the wall Middle Eastern food.  Le Kebab has excellent food.  I have brought two middle eastern friends here and they confirm the cuisine is authentic.  One of them would drive from Rock Hill up to University area (40 minutes) just for this restaurant.  The key items to try here include the chicken shwarma, gyro plate, and lamb kebab plate.  Other items of note include the Vimto juice drink, lentil soup that is served with most dinner plates, and the baklava.  Le Kebab also provides excellent garlic mayonnaise, tzatziki, and tahini sauces .  The portions are a bit large for one person, but the food heats up well as leftovers.  I cannot speak to the hookah aspect of the restaurant, but there are regular customers who partake in it that swear by Le Kebab.  The hookah customers never seem to affect other diners with smoke smell or crowd the restaurant so I've never had that as a problem.  Parking is generally available and food is served quickly dine in or carry out.  For the money Le Kebab is an incredible value.  A meal for two will generally be under $25.  Ownership/management is always around and friendly, and I have never had problems with service there.",

Plenty of parking available too. Be careful with directions on google maps because the location is incorrect on there. This place is next to Jimmy John's.

We weren't sure what to get but ended up deciding on the mixed shawarma over hummus to split instead of apps. It was awesome! The chicken and lamb were both super juicy and full of flavor. The hummus was perfectly balanced - you could taste a bit of garlic, some tahini, and olive oil but none overpowered the other elements. The free pita bread with it was great as well, and they'll give you an unlimited amount according to our waiter; we didn't get extra as we had just enough for the dish. We actually planned on having more than one dish but it was huge and we were both full after since it was just an afternoon \"snack\".  Great deal for $11 for the huge plate, the flavor was superb, and the service was solid.",

The portion on this dish was more than adequate. They could have gave me half of the and I might still not finish.   The environment here is casual. They try to decorate the place to have a slight middle eastern feel. It's a great place to catch up with a friend, which was what I did.

    "text": "This was the surprise dinner of the year! My son's friend works here and he wanted to go visit his bud. He (my son) told us the food was good but he's 15 so who the hell listens to food advice from a teen!?! (NOTE: This excellent review has absolutely nothing to do with knowing an employee. If I didn't like it I would just have not reviewed it out of respect to him.)   Le Kabob is situated in the back portion of The Promenade at the corner of Harris Blvd and North Tryon. It is a fairly unassuming place in a corner spot. They do have their name in letters on the top of the building but other wise just a very small sign that hangs above the door.   We walked in, there is a counter to order to go or they will seat you and send a waiter your way. We did the latter.   Bottom line is: The food was EXCELLENT! You get a falafel plate after ordering (like an Italian place sends bread). They were outstanding. And the Baba Ganoush (apparently that's blended spiced eggplant, which I generally despise eggplant) was wonderful as was the humus (which i generally love).   I got the slow cooked lamb shank with rice, my wife got he lamb kebabs and my son got the mixed kebabs (Chicken, lamb instead of kefta and beef). Each plate was super tasty and cooked perfectly. They all came on HUGE beds of insanely well cooked rice (as a cook, myself, I can really appreciate rice done so well.) We also order the chicken wings for an app (white people, am I right!?! I am right!) Not sure the spice blend but they were yummy and crispy and very good as well.   So, as a lesson to all of you with kids: Every now and again they get it right. I wanted to eat there again the night afterward but got shot down in place of burgers/steaks) I was bummed. This will absolutely be one of our go to joints on the reg. And as a bonus, the prices are pretty reasonable.",

We ordered hummus which was good (that's why i gave it 2 stars ) but the pita bread wasn't very good, I didn't think it was fresh. I had the Greek salad with chicken, I didn't like it. My husband had the gyro plate with veggies but he didn't care for it either.",

I had the Lamb and Chicken over rice (the one that's pictured the most in here) it was definitely worth the $11.00!! So much food and everything was delicious. I hope to come back when I get a chance.  Also, ask for the pita chips!! They will only give it to you if you ASK :)",

Per the nice cashier's suggestion, I ordered the lamb shawarma with a side of fries. After a 7 minute wait and admiring the clean, well-kept interior, my food was ready. When I opened the box, (2 minutes afterwards) I was saddened by the lackluster and limp fries, no salt or seasoning and not cooked well. Nothing special there. The shawarma was chocked full of lamb but was only topped with a hefty amount of raw onions, tomatoes and a little sauce. None of the other toppings listed on the board were present.  The pita was sadly store-bought and served room temperature. The lamb was tough, lukewarm and lacked flavor. I had to go back in just to get hot sauce which made it tolerable but it still wasn't the flavor journey I was expecting. Maybe I just came at a bad time given all of the good reviews. Unfortunately, I have to admit,  I've had better shawarma off street carts.   3 stars for cleanliness and good customer service.",

Small little restaurant with about 4 times as many people working than eating so the service was extraordinary. As far as the food, I've had better but it was still good. I feel like they toned it down on the spices to make it more acceptable to the general public. I had the chicken swarma over rice with a salad and the chicken was slightly dry. We also had the kofta kebab with rice and steamed vegetables. It was very little meat compared to the massive amount of rice. The meat was alright but would've been better with more flavor and seasoning. The steamed veggies was perfect.",

It didn't seem like a lot of food, but I was quite satisfied once I finished it. Everyone else loved their dishes too. What really set this place apart was the service. My sister is gluten-free and forgot to ask about the dish she ordered being gluten free. She got fish that ended up being slightly breaded, and the staff was SO NICE about it. The waitress got her a fresh menu and the two of the guys from the kitchen came out to make sure she could get something to fit her diet (usually not an issue at these types of places). She ended up with chicken on a bed of hummus and they subbed in some veggies for her to dip with. All the people who came by came by with a smile and wanted to make sure she was happy. I really cannot say enough for the exceptional service of the staff.",

    "text": "So good even the water gets 5 stars!  Went here this weekend with some family - specifically because it was nearby some stores we were at, but also because they had vegan options.  It was refreshing to have the staff well versed on allergies and ingredients in their food and made it tremendously easy to find options for everyone.  I had the lentil soup and falafel wrap with a shareable plate of hummus for my relatives.  The lentil soup was perfect for a cold day and had a creamy texture (lentils, carrots, potatoes blended).  The table hot sauce and some pepper took this to another level.  The hummus was prototype smooth goodness and the pita actually came out warm (some places get lazy, but not Le Kebab Grill!)  We had them bring out some other hot sauce that we all could pretty much drink because it was delicious (more on this in a few lines).  The falafel wrap was out of this world.  The actual falafel were super crispy on the outside with warm, perfectly seasoned insides.  It had some lettuce, tomato and more hummus with tahini sauce  on the inside which made it quite filling.  This was one of those scenarios where we were so full off the generous servings, but our mouths were so hypnotized that we could have easily forced some more food down our bellies.    Back to the hot sauces - we ended up asking one of our servers if they sold the sauce and what was in it.  We were told they actually bought the sauce and when we asked what kind it was- they went back and snapped a pic of the bottles - awesome service!  Ironically these were both common sauces easily found in stores but perhaps the spell-casting capabilities of Le Kebab Grill can make anything taste 10x better - even the water!  Will definitely be going back here - something for everyone.",

We ordered an appetizer combination, which allows you to choose 3 items from a list of about 6. We selected the hummus (extremely smooth, almost creamy, and a good portion), falafel (seemed a little denser than I'm used to, but still yummy), and the grape leaves (I am not a huge fan in general, but I tried a bite and liked them).  I was kind of disappointed that none of the 4 kid's meal choices were anything middle eastern at all. It was all the same hamburger /chicken nugget fare you can get anywhere. I opted to have them share a chicken kebab plate, and my husband and I had other varieties. There are 3 kinds of rice available: plain basmati, mandi (which is yellow and mildly seasoned), and kapsa (which is light brown from all of the spices! It's not hot spicy, but has such a fabulous flavor punch. I really enjoyed it) As our second side, my husband and I chose the lentil soup, which was also very flavorful. Overall, service was fairly attentive and the food will definitely merit a return visit.",

    "text": "It appears major retail may be vacating the central University City area over to Northlake and Concord Mills. Even more will be splitting when the new shopping center opens near Ikea. A plus to this appears to be lower rents and more ethic type restaurants. Great for me; probably bad for real estate investors. Le Kebab Grill is a fine Middle Eastern option; worth checking out for some variety and adventurous cuisine.  The restaurant set up is simple; light colored walls with modern art and large windows streaming sunlight. Service has been friendly, prompt and helpful. Falafel is dense, hot and delicious with the tahini sauce; the eight piece serving split between two people will go fast. The stuffed grape leaves are tasty as well; slick with olive oil and shaped like cigars.  The Kafta Kabobs consists of seasoned ground beef pressed around a skewer and redolent of cumin with perhaps a touch of cinnamon; order it all the time it's so yummy. You can get your main with a salad simply dressed with olive oil and lemon juice. Some days the dressing is better than others; perfect with the right amount of lemon juice but on occasion it seems to come out of a particularly harsh bottle of True Lemon. The rice they serve is tasty and generously portioned. The last time I was there they offered a smoked rice and it was so good; yellow rice with a subtle smoked flavor.  Good food, nice portions and great prices; I'll be back for more!",

They have a variety of Middle Eastern dishes that can be either ordered in a pita wrap or as an entree with rice, salad, and soup. My personal favorite is the chicken Shwarma entree with lentil soup and salad. Le Kebab Grill's atmosphere is good, although it is more a fast food rather than restaurant ambiente. The prices are pretty average for the entrees, however the wraps are very inexpensive. The garlic and hot sauce are amazing, unfortunately there is a limitation on sauces per entree. Staff and location are amazing. I really like that place!",

    "text": "I normally don't write reviews, especially bad ones but this time it's a must. I really wish I could give this place a ZERO star!! We use to come here couple times a week spending at least $40 each time until recently, their service has gotten really bad. It was just us and another table, all the waiters just sat there and stare at us, finally a girl came and took our order. We ordered the chicken wings, Mozart and Gyro plate. We used to love the wings, dried rub with spices, however, this time the wings were smother in sauce. When we asked them about it, the girl said she'll get the cook to redo it. Once she brought it back to the kitchen, we can hear the cook yelling at her saying that it's the only way he can make it. She came back to tell us that there's nothing they can do. These wings looks like they came from Costco. It was disgusting!! We didn't even touch it. We can see all the waiters looking at us and talking as we were eating. It was really uncomfortable. Needless to say, this will be our last time here and we will be spending our money elsewhere. They really need to improve their customer service and the kitchen staff.",

But seeing how I went here on so many special occasions in previous years I was tied to the place. Not anymore. So sad to see a once good business tank. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR SERVICE.",

    "text": "There are few places in Charlotte with middle eastern food and this place not only has a great selection but it's of high quality and great taste! Be sure to try the kafta or mixed grill kabobs, and the yellow rice is very well cooked and prepared! They have a nice chill dining area and outdoor seating area too.  The carry out is also prepared fast but with quality. I had a small issue once where my card was charged twice for the same meal but the manager took care of it very quickly when it was shown to him. Make sure to visit!",
