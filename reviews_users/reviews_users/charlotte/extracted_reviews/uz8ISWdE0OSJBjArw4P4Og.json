    "text": "Have you ever walked into a place and been not only greeted by name but the bartender knows what you drink / eat?  Oh, and this person is ready to serve you (already making your drink)!  Having traveled for a work for many years, as well as a background in the service industry, this type of service can be few and far between.  When Mellow Mushroom opened uptown, honestly, I had my doubts.  I have visited them in MANY towns.  I have found that they are typically rather run-of-the-mill, however there is one bartender in the Uptown Charlotte location that stands out.    Please don't think twice about walking past Mellow Mushroom Uptown and stopping by to see Ran-D (okay, it's Randy).  I have first-hand seen him go above and beyond to ensure that every drink and food order exceeds customers' anticipations.  Such expectations are far beyond what you may find at a typical bar or restaurant.  Do yourself a favor, swing by MM Uptown, sit at the bar, and make sure you ask for Ran-D.  *And please tell him that Jennifer T. sent you.  ;)",

Got there at 9:40pm, leaving now starved?? The waitress said the kitchen gets overwhelmed, however the table next to us who got there 20 minutes after us, after requesting their food to go due to the long wait, actually got their food, they were brought their food in boxes???? We left with nothing?? We ordered one pizza and 3 calzones, no specialty??? It was on the menu?? The fact that nobody cared, the waitress knew we were upset and could have cared less even after we sat there for 90 minutes. Why does anybody eat here????",

The bartenders in plain sight had their greasy hair down, eating their lunch licking their dirty fingers right in front of clientele. The \"manager\" was quite dumpy with a unprofessional demeanor. Other staff ignored empty cluttered tables, as diners were left to stare at the abandoned food about. The floor was covered in trash, the pizza was uncut and to be quite frank the whole restaurant and its staff seemed to be incompetent unwelcoming and unapologetic. Will never return.",

    "text": "Let me begin by saying I used to love Mellow Mushroom, I've been to two locations had nothing except wonderful service and food. I can't say the same for this location. We were there around 8PM on a Friday there was no wait except for service to your table.  As we were seated our server appeared requesting drink orders, my husband had never been so it might been nice to be given just a second to look over the beer choices. I ended up only ordering water bc I didn't enjoy a server standing over my while I choose my beer. Our spinach artichoke dip was ok different than most but ok. Our food arrived in a timely manner, sadly it's just not the MM pizza I remember.  First the good, my husband ordered a meatball sub that totally enjoyed!! It certainly was a huge portion to say the least!! Now the not so the pizza dough was a bit tough and although cooked through a tad \"doughy\". To me that means old dough or not properly prepared dough. I know as I make bread often. There was almost something extremely hard and crunchy in the crust. At first I was afraid I'd chipped a tooth as the crunch was normal crust crunch and could not be \"chewed\" whatever it was I found in 3 of the 4 slice 10inch. My water was empty more than full and we waited over 15 minutes for a second beer-----that's after it's been requested, it arrived as we were requesting to go boxes. Needless to say that beer didn't get consumed as we were finished with our meal and requested to go boxes. When she dropped off the boxes she asked about dessert we said no thanks we are good to go, you'd think \"I'm ready for our check\" didn't need to be said since we declined dessert. We still had to wait and wait then finally track down our server for our check. I'm sure it's not easy being a server but please at least act as if you like your job and pretend you are happy!!!",

I got the small and it was the perfect size.   Overall, it was a great experience and I'd definitely come back! Great service and delicious food!",

Tastes like the ingredients went way down hill.  Steak calzone was aweful which was not the steak of past(if you can even call it steak now). The pizza (sausage and pepperoni) was bland and dough was rubbery.  Very, very disappointed. My guess is they sold out for cheap ingredients for more profit.",

I didn't think traveling a couple hundred feet for a delivery was a big deal however, they didn't want my money or my business.  If they won't travel a couple of hundred feet for me I doubt I'll ever travel that far to visit one of their restaurants either.  So near and yet so far.",

Although when we ate on the patio last week we had about 5 people stop us while eating and ask us for money. That's why I'm not giving the place 5 stars. It has nothing to do with the food (which I loved), or the service (which was excellent), but just the people walking by. Unless its busy on the patio I would recommend sitting inside.",

    "text": "It's great to have a Mellow Mushroom in Uptown!  That being said... I think they have found some sort of a balance between the restaurants quirky, relaxed approach to pizza and Uptown's modern, business-like persona.  Being located in one of the newer apartment buildings (Catalyst), this location screams modern from the outside, however it have a small bout of personality with the signage out front:  uptown skyline with a rising (or setting) mushroom in the back.  If you go here for lunch and order a pizza, get ready for a  bit of a wait since they cook the pizza to order (per usual Mellow Mushroom standards).  They have plenty of \"faster\" options like salad or small apps that probably doesn't consume your lunch hour, but I'd say to come here for the pizza.  My favorites include the Mighty Meaty and the Philosopher's Pie.  Nothing beats freshly made pizza.  There are a ton of tables here, and even a bar to sit at.  No shortage of TV's around to watch sporting events.  I guess the only thing missing is a half of a bus you can dine in, or a normal, signature giant mushrooms decorating the outdoor patio.  They do have some pretty cool 60's/mod sci-fi art that sets the mood for the restaurant.  For some reason, the bright orange chairs in the dining room remind me of the Jetsons.  Servers are friendly enough and make sure you are well taken care of.  Great place for little ones and conveniently located next to Romeare Bearden Park.  You can escape the heat of the park for some nice A/C and snacks.",

I prefer the Kosmic Karma, which has Red sauce base with feta and mozzarella cheeses, spinach, sun- dried tomatoes and Roma tomatoes with a pesto swirl. This is one of a few options for the vegetarians out there.   The uptown location can get busy around lunch, but the kitchen does a good job of churning out pizzas in a reasonable time.  On my last visit, I was checking in on Yelp and asked a cashier whether they delivered. It turns out that while Mellow Mushroom doesn't deliver, there is a service called QuickFox that will deliver MM pizza to you. The cashier even provided me with a magnet to help me remember. I have always experienced good service whether getting takeout, eating lunch, having dinner, or dining at the bar. It's a well run establishment and if you haven't been, make it a point to go.",

I like to start with the greek salad - the esperanza dressing is perfect.  And then go for a medium pizza to split between 2 of us.   I love the Holy Shitake pie - subbing a red sauce for the base - or the carmelized onions and portobellas.   Depending on our hunger level, we may or may not go home with leftovers.",

No excuse given, we decided to order take out pizza and were told 30 mins wait while she swiped the card so basically no turn around zone. We would have left, but we had hungry kids. So we sat there and we're upset but then again we knew it's a busy day just mad we weren't updated as to what exactly happened to our party being seated. While there were emptying tables around. Manager Sydney happens to pass by and asks if we were ok-we told her what happened. She quickly sits us down, expedites the to go order, brings us cheese bread and drinks. She was amazing and wasn't expecting that considering what we went through. I hope she reads this and how amazing she was today!!! The pizza was so delicious as well!",

Last night we arrived at 8:00 to celebrate my friends birthday. We were sat right away, as there were only 15 or so other parties in the restaurant, half of which were done eating their food. Upon sitting, we waited more than five minutes for our waitress to arrive at our table. She finally came over and took our drink orders and we went ahead and ordered our appetizer and pizzas since we knew what we wanted. 45 minutes later we still had not received our pretzels or food. Our waiter had come by many times to refill drinks but never mentioned our pretzels. I asked another waiter walking by to check on them and long story short they said the kitchen was behind... which didn't make sense considering we were one of the only few tables in the restaurant. The manager came over and said the pretzels would be comped. After an hour of being seated, we received our pizzas.. and my pizza came out wrong. I told the lady I had ordered pineapple on the pizza so she took it back to the kitchen and returned with my pizza; however, it was completely burnt. The pizza tasted awful and the crust was inedible. Our waitress was very apologetic and she did a good job, but the kitchen obviously needs some improvement.",

We got there around 10:40 after the fireworks ended at the Knights game Friday night, and we had to wait 10 minutes to be seated. maybe had 20 other patrons there. Still had to wait. We were hungry and we're like well we like it so whatever. Alst the while a guy is standing at the front counter, barely acknowledged our presence, and just stood there. Finally a girl comes and seats us and gives us our menus and tells us our waiter will be by shortly to take our drink orders. So we wait probably another 5-10 minutes, enough time to figure out what we were getting, and then I guess she was our waiter, walks up and doesn't even offer to take our drink order before she rather rudely tells us they aren't taking orders anymore and that they are only selling slices of pepperoni and cheese pizza. We both weren't exactly thrilled but we were both hungry and I had a 3 hour drive to make back home so I just said yeah whatever. Don't understand why you close your kitchen down an hour before closing time. That's absurd. It gets even better. She finally comes back around after we order two slices of pepperoni pizza and offers to get us drinks. We've been there probably 30 minutes at this point. So we both were rather upset. We ended up waiting nearly an hour on a water and two slices of pizza that we never even received all the while our \"waiter\" was bringing other folks who had put orders in as we were being seated their food. She came by I think twice and told us they were cooking the pizzas fresh. Turned around to look in the kitchen and the 3 cooks were goofing off in plain sight. We waited I think about 10 more minutes and decided enough was enough and left. I've never seen such abysmal service at a restaurant. From the time we walked in to the time we left. We will NEVER be back.",

    "text": "Disappointing. That might not seem to be the case given the \"A-OK\" 3-star review, but we had Mellow Mushroom in Jacksonville Beach two summers ago and it was way better. So, we were disappointed.   When we walked in, the place was clean and comfortable, but the host brought three of us (notice the number three [in written form]) to a table for two. This was despite several booths being open since it was early for lunch on a Saturday. My wife and I looked at each other in a puzzled manner and I asked for a booth. Request granted.   We ordered and then waited about 20 minutes for our pizza. During that time, I visited the bathroom just to see how it looked. Clean. Check there. The service was also friendly, but obviously the food took a long time.   As for the pizza itself (the most important factor), the dough is exceptionally good, but the sauce tastes like pizza sauce you would have if it a bowling alley birthday party. My wife agreed and added that it tastes like it comes from a jar. I know the sauce doesn't come from a jar (this is directed at management before they defend themselves), but it TASTES like it comes from a jar.   I'll sum it up this way. I would assume this location attracts many drunks and stoners based on the location. Those people are going to leave higher reviews because drunks can't taste much and stoners think everything tastes great. Therefore, it's an ideal location. But to have this location and still only have a 3-star average is worrisome.   We will try another Mellow Mushroom in the future for a tiebreaker, but it won't be this location.",

Not sure who was more annoying.   I would recommend the Holy Shiitake, however, be sure to ask for light garlic/mayo drizzling. I love sauce as much as the next guy, but it was just way too much, I had to scrape it off the pizza.",

The hostess kept coming by and saying our order would be ready soon and that they hadn't forgotten about us.  That was fine. However, when we finally got the pizza it was COLD. I am extremely disappointed that we had to wait so long to end up getting a less than fresh product. Also, the pizza was ordered to be lightly baked but unfortunately our request was not honored. The bottom was completely burned. It is not the first time our pizza has had a burned bottom which is why we always make a point of requesting lightly baked to prevent this.  We literally live right next door to the restaurant so we routinely patronize it. I certainly didn't mind the wait but I expected to at least receive a hot and fresh product at the end of it which didn't occur. The staff appears to be very poorly equipped to handle a busy night.",

These pizzas are not something I am fine with having messed up and wait another 20-25 minutes for another. They are pricey and I cannot stand waiting an hour for a simple pizza. Our table and two other tables in the clump around us all had messed up pizzas. The server and manager were very nice as to comp our pizza but I can't hold my tongue anymore. I hate to be the negative Nancy but management needs to have a serious talking to the kitchen staff. The servers are aware of how pizzas are ordered and kind write it very clearly but the kitchen staff doesn't seem to care. I'm starting to understand why it seems to be pretty dead every time I go in. It sucks because he pizza is really good when made correctly.",

Server told us it would be about 25 minutes for our large pizza; no problem. My pet peeve is waiting for the check and mellow definitely irritates me on this one. I consistently wait 10-20 minutes to get a check. Tonight's visit was closer to 20. I was getting up from my table to find someone when our server finally appeared.

Took time enjoying the beer and witnessed a slightly belligerent and obviously drunk couple being upset over the time of their to go order, that they had only placed a few minutes before.  I watched the encounter and felt as if the Mellow Mushroom staff and management handled the situation extremely well.  I've worked in hospitality so I know how tense these encounters can be but I was impressed by the Mellow Mushroom staff.

Even better to come here late night after hanging out with my friend Mary Jane, if you know what I mean.  What do I love about THIS Mellow Mushroom? The service is freakin rad. I've met some really cool people here and they are always willing to bend over backwards to make sure you get what you want. Also: great outdoor parkside seating.

I had the chicken wings and pretzels appetizers which were excellent. I tried the gluten free pizza, but it was a disappointment. It wasn't so much as a crust problem, I didn't even really like the cheese either.   When you go to a pizza restaurant and like everything but the pizza, you'd think that would be a problem. Well, if you want a pizza it can be. The bar around the back is lively so stop in for a few drinks, order an appetizer, and then head on home.  UPDATE: Went back August 2014. I was served this ridiculously burnt pretzel appetizer. Clearly no quality control in the kitchen. I uploaded the photo as proof so check it out! So disappointed now, will never be returning.",

    "text": "Big disappointment.  We had family from out of town and my daughter recommended to try Mellow Mushroom in uptown since she enjoyed the one in Charleston, SC.  First off, it took a long while for someone to come to our table after we were seated. The place was not busy at all. There was nothing going on uptown--no games, no concerts.  Our server finally came and she turned out to be super sweet. Really. Nice friendly smile. Seems genuine. Our order came about 45 minutes after we ordered. Our server said enjoy your meal and disappeared before we can say, we don't have silverware! We all had salad to consume. We finally got the attention of another staff to give us some silverware.  As for the food? The caesar salad was nothing special and they were served in this half-plate, half-bowl to make them look like there's more than there truly is. The pizzas? We ordered the Thai and the one with the portabella mushroom. Nothing could be more boring. Taste bland. No traces of garlic where they should be at least in the sauce! Pizza and garlic no matter how faint should go hand in hand. I showered mine with Tabasco sauce and red pepper to give them more taste. Dough, well, too doughy. Heads up on that one.  BTW, I had to tell our server that chunks of old cheese were stuck on my menu. Isn't that a health code violation? So, wrong.  I work uptown and I have to say that this will be my last choice if eating out. Last, as in after Panera bread and Subway.  The location is great! It will continue to be busy, but most likely will not have a loyal following.",

Granted, we came on a very odd day and mid day when it wasn't very busy and I think that's problematic sometimes for kitchen and wait staff.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was really nice, as a matter of fact, all the staff is super nice and attentive.  It was just the meatballs I had weren't really cooked all the way through to a point where the cheese even melted.  That won't keep me away though.  The beers here are pretty solid as is the case with most MM's.  The interior is just as funky as the other locations as well.  The only drawback here is going to be the parking as is most places Uptown.",

Our server and his trainee were both scatterbrains (not organized), couldn't answer any of my menu questions, and were kinda awkward to talk to....   Food took longer than 45 mins to hit the table. Maybe that's typical for this restaurant? It didn't seem that busy though.  I ordered a salad and added avocado to it. I got three small avocado slices on the side (picture less than a fourth of a normal size avocado). I was charged almost $4 for \"avocado\" on my bill. Just as much as I was charged for the steak that was added to my salad.  Overall, my mellow mushroom dinner was disappointing. I don't think I'll be back.",

Last time we went they got our pizza order wrong twice and we even told them what their specialty pie had on it after the first one and they messed it up again. The third one was mostly correct. Today we visited and they didn't put cheese on my hoagie and didn't know the proper ingredients for their own hoagie. Also our server took our sauces away without a word while we were still eating. Not to mention we had to tell them we didnt have a server after we sat for about 10 minutes. To boot we never recieved the waters we ordered twice. It is a shame because i love mellow mushroom but this location is absolutely miserable and obviously managed quite poorly. Would not recommend to anyone.",

This location is a bit quirky, but features everything you would expect. Rather than do a lengthy rundown of my experience (and previous experiences here), I'm just going to create a simple pro-con list to consider if you are in the area.   The Pros:   - Some of the better crust in the city, if that's your thing  - Super convenient location  - Nice outdoor patio - great for taking you dog (which we did for bark in the park)  - Great beer selection (~40 taps or so, tons of local choices)  The Cons:  - Service is usually a bit slow. However, last night our waiter was on point, so I might not list this one here again  - Decor is a bit odd. Think 70's shag carpet meets business casual. Probably wouldn't take a client here for dinner  All in all it is about what you would expect in a great location. Definitely a spot I hit up late night after a knights or Panther's game!",

I called a friend to meet me out there and we grabbed a drink, appetizers and of course a vegetarian pizza.   The atmosphere was fun and trendy! It was definitely kid-friendly and my son had a great time, as well!! I would suggest going on an empty stomach because you will be eating your share of bread! If you're a bread fan, you will love this place. But a person like me, needs to be careful, it is very easy to consume too much and fast. Especially since everything is sooooooo tasty!   The service was excellent as well! Our waiter was very patient and knowledgeable about the menu! Don't forget to check in and redeem your free Hummus or Bruschetta appetizer! We chose the Hummus, which was good, nothing special about it, I mean it's hummus. The Pretzel Bites were tasty, but they reminded me of bread just covered in salt. And lastly, the Pizza it was delicious, I can still taste it! If I don't go back for anything else, I will be back for more pizza!!",

An hour later, and one coworker still doesn't have her 1 slice of CHEESE pizza. Ridiculous!!!!! Our customer service sucked today. We were offered no refills. The manager was very accommodating when I spoke to him, but it still should not have come to that.  We finally get that one slice of cheese pizza, and it's cold. Again, manager was very nice and replaced it immediately.",

Once it was here, it was great! But for a Monday night, when it was slow to begin with, we shouldn't have had to wait that long to be served. As my first time in Charlotte, I'd say definitely a spot to check out, if you are not in a rush!   Update, June 2017: it has been over a year and I came back to town this weekend for my sisters wedding. We went in last night and I figured I'd give them another chance. We only had 3 people order food and it took a half hour + for the food to arrive. The food was hot which leads me to believe it took them awhile to put the order in in the kitchen. We asked for a manager multiple times and that took a a long time as well! The food is good but if you REALLY have time to waste, go ahead. We probably won't be returning.

We had the bruschetta this visit, and it was good as well. You can also never go wrong with Kosmic Karma or the Mighty Meaty.

    "text": "Took in the Knights game and was craving pizza after the game. We had left the game in the last inning Saturday night, so we expected the restaraunt to be busy. Fortunately it wasn't. We walked in and waited at the hostess station for over 3 minutes. A waitress walked by and said someone would be with us. Still waiting and finally someone came up-a young guy with a man bun. No smile, no thanks for waiting, just a blank stare. I finally broke the silence and said \"there's 3 of us\". He stared down at the seating chart for a good 30 seconds, grabbed menu's and started off at a brisk clip to the back area by the bar/bathrooms. We had no idea he was seating us-again, no words ever left his lips to indicate we were to follow him--we did anyway, thinking we had nothing to lose. He seated us and mumbled \"your server will be with you.\" We sat at the table for over 15 minutes before a server finally came by, Zach, who mumbled an apology (who knew that would be the theme of the night). He took our drink order, which was not complex: a beer, a glass of wine and a mixed drink. About 5 minutes later he came back, apologized for being busy and asked for our drink order AGAIN. Waited, waited and waited. Finally, our knight in shining armor came back a THIRD time, confirmed our drink order AGAIN and said they would be right out. We told him we wanted to order--I was hoping to see a pad of paper and pen, but alas....he apparently took pride in his memory. BIG mistake. Simple order: Caeser salad, large cheese pizza with black olives and meatballs. Drinks finally arrived, he confirmed our meal order AGAIN and offered yet another apology while throwing the rest of the staff under the bus by saying something about the bar not getting it right, too few waiters, too busy, etc.. Essentially, saying no one there knew how to do their job and it was effecting him doing his, which did not explain how he could forget our drink and food order multiple times. Writing orders down is apparently a lost art.   Our friends salad arrived about 5 minutes ahead of our pizza. We enjoyed watching him eat. Pizza finally arrived, just cheese. No olives, no meatballs. Dreading having a long, drawn out useless discussion with the waiter, I simply asked that he make sure the olives/meatballs were not on our check-clearly, they weren't on the pizza. He then said the kitchen messed up. I truly didn't care who did or didn't do what, just wanted to make sure we weren't charged. Finished dinner, didn't bother with another round of drinks for fear I would age another year while waiting. Got our check and no, we were not charged for the extras we didn't get, probably because they were never on the order in the first place.   I left a $5 tip on a $33 check--only because we love their pizza and I wanted the cooks to get something for their creation.  We did witness a waitress bust her tail waiting on a table of about 12 people. We were very jealous of the service and attention they got, so kudo's to her for knowing what GREAT service is.  I can only blame management for their lack of training in customer service. I can't imagine why there would not be a manager on duty on the weekends and if their was, then he/she needs to go back to training. He/she should have been walking the floor, making sure customers were being tended to. Chatting with anyone sitting in our area, with the exception of the large group, he/she would have heard the same complaint from anyone sitting in that section.   This place is in a prime location-ballpark, hotels, the park and has the potential to be a gold mine, if someone truly cared.",

I was seated quickly and ordered the hummus appetizer, which you could get either pita slices OR carrots/ celery according to the menu. I ordered carrots/celery, but received pita wedges with 2 slices of both celery and carrots and was told \"Don't worry about it- they didn't charge you extra for the pita.\" To which I replied \"Thank you but can I have more carrots and celery\" since that's what I ordered. I order a cider which I found out they ran out of 5 minutes after ordering it. I was given my beer and it spilled all over the table with no attempt to clean it up. My server was blatantly ignoring me as I tried ordering pizza so I just figured I would get out of there ASAP. Didn't get a chance to try the pizza and it's a good thing because as I was leaving I overheard other tables discussing their choices and it turns out, I wasn't even given the entire menu!! I was only given the appetizer page along with the specials page which listed 3-4 pizzas. Come to find out there were tons of other choices- salads, sandwiches, etc. Very disappointing after getting such a good review from a friend. Honestly don't waste your time!",

    "text": "This pizza spot was stumbled upon as my husband and I walked our first night Uptown Charlotte.  It was very close to the park where we watched fire works and children playing in the multi colored water falls!   As soon as we walked in we were seated with a view of the street.   The menu was awesome. We ordered the Meatball Trio. They were huge and smothered in a fabulous sauce. The meat was seasoned to perfection and there was just enough cheese for a cheese fanatic like me.  We also ordered a small House Special pizza! It was freaking amazing! Pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham, bacon, mushrooms, olives, green peppers, roma tomatoes and onion! Incredible! Best pizza I ever had in my life!   I will be going back as much as possible.",

We had a five top and the server rarely came to the table, always seemed like he was in a hurry, forgot someones entire dinner plate, forgot ranch and drinks a couple of times, and the pizza that ended up coming out was burnt. Then to top it off they didnt offer any compensation for our horrible experience and the forgotten pizza. I am absolutely not going back again. Hope they improve though cuz they have a nice bar.",

    "text": "So I just moved here from Philadelphia, and had never heard of Mellow Mushroom til a native down here recommended we check it out one night. SO DELICIOUS !!!! I was  blown away by how the chefs are able to completely transform even the most basic pizza by adding their special ingrediants and flavor! :) For example, the Mediterranean pizza REALLY tastes like a Gyro! And the Mexican South of the Border Pizza really captures the taste of Mexican cuisine. Every pizza is so dramatically different and unique. There is something for everyone, vegetarians included. I cannot say enough good things about this place, I went there three times last week so that should speak for itself.. Safe to say this is one of my favorite things about the South sofar :) My friends up north are missing out!  If you haven't been here and you live down south.. What are you waiting for? They are everywhere around here, so check them out! Enjoy!",

    "text": "This place is a JOKE!  Mellow Mushroom Corporate needs to helicopter in Gordon Ramsey to whip this operation into shape.  Have been coming to this place since the ballpark opened and it's been a series of hits and misses.  Make that a series if misses and misses.  Was thinking growing pains would be worked through by now, but I just don't think anyone there gets it.  Tonight after our party of three was seated hastily in a crowded section, we noticed the table behind us was having obvious issues with their food and service.  Our problems started about 10 minutes later, when we still had not been approached by any wait staff, although plenty seemed to be running around not accomplishing much (same for the manager who was trying to appease the unhappy table behind us).  He didn't pay us any more attention than our absent waitstaff.   After running down a busboy to ask him to find someone to help us, a waiter appeared, took our order and then he must have left the building.  The drink I ordered arrived about 20 minutes after I ordered (no exaggeration) and then still later another waitress brought some, but not all, of our food.  So with some our order still MIA, our original mystery man waiter was spotter so we flagged him down.  He acted shocked and appalled part of our order hadn't made it to us.  He said he'd take the missing food off our bill (what a prince... You mean your not going to charge me for food I never got?  A-1 customer service).  And the food we did get was devoid of any flavor.  Soup and salads with zero taste.  Nada.  And on top of all this, the atmosphere was so awkward because you could sense multiple tables around us all starting to fall apart as well.  The absolute worst restaurant downtown, bar none.  I was forced by Yelp to give a minimum star review, but really it should be ZERO.",

However, we waited an hour and fifteen minutes for two pizzas that we ordered. After an hour and fifteen minutes, we only got ONE of our pizzas. After our waiter (who never gave his name) came back and told us that the cooks wouldn't tell him where our pizza was, I asked him to get a manager. The manager came back and said that our pizza had been dropped on the floor and the cooks didn't want to tell anyone and get in trouble so that it would be out in 6-8 minutes. meanwhile, our waiter was going to bring my mom a birthday dessert. After waiting for the second pizza for an additional 20 minutes and half of our party was done eating, I began to start on my pizza. Half way through, I found a disgusting hair in my food. Asked my waiter to speak to the manager AGAIN. It took the manager (who never gave his name either) 10 minutes to come to my table and explain this situation to me. Needless to say, we didn't finish, pay for, or take the meal home. This place is disgusting, the waiters and managers are extremely unprofessional and if you want good service and pizza, visit the Myers Park location. THIS IS NOT WHERE YOU WANT TO GO.",

We went to the bar to order a pizza to go, which was delicious, a beer, and a glass of wine. My girlfriend asked if they had Sauvignon Blanc. The bartender mentioned the name of the bottle and poured her a glass. He never mentioned that the wine wasn't part of the 1/2 off discount. The one glass cost $11.00, at a pizza shop! We could have ordered an entire bottle!! When we got the bill and shared our concern, the bartender rambled on about drinking good wine and how he worked at a wine bar, etc, even after my girlfriend told him she drinks any wine, red or white, and would have been happy with anything that was 1/2 off. Wasn't expecting any sort of compensation, mistakes happen,but the fact that nothing was offered, I'll reconsider where I drop $50 for a pizza and drink.",

They're were also a lot of staff just lollygagging around. The pizza was good per usual. A guy who I believe was the manager asked how everything was once we got our food and we expressed our complaints he didn't offer a resolution of sorts for the wait just expressed that he understood how we felt. My wife had to ask him to at least comp the $.25 they charge for each ranch. They were also out of a few beers I asked for. Also the single stall restroom was disgusting.

The good news is there's now one called the Pacific Rim (red sauce with mozzarella, ham, bacon, caramelized onions, pineapple and jalapenos). It's kind of similar and also totally delicious. Okay Mellow Mushroom, I forgive you.  I'm not a huge crust person. For me, it's just a waste of carbs. However, I will eat this crust (buttered and sprinkled with parmesan) and I don't even need anything for dipping. They use the same dough for their pretzels. Mental note to myself: order the pretzels and beer cheese next time. For the gluten free crowd, there's a ton of options for you. We took advantage of the Yelp check in (free bruschetta or hummus) and opted for the hummus (easier to share since we had a group). I would normally never think to get hummus here, but it was tasty. Christi got the Enlightened Spinach Salad which looked good. I like that they also have a build your own salad section.   This is a great spot to hit if you work uptown or at heading to either Panthers stadium or the ballpark. If you're not already uptown, it's kind of a pain in the ass to park. You have to pay at the decks. Pro tip: check the streets around it (Poplar, etc). Meters are free after 6pm.",

I would go back if that was a convenient option but I don't think I would crave the food.",

On a Monday night, we anticipated being served quickly because the place was empty but jokes on us. Sat at 8pm, pretzel bites arrived 35 mins after ordering and a pizza 30 mins after that! Staff wasn't attentive either. I regret the decision to have Mellow tonight. If you're looking for a nice dinner a Mellow I definitely don't recommend this location!",

While I was waiting for my carry out pie, I watched as one of the cooks in the open kitchen was trying to hand toss  some dough, with less than stellar results; It made me wonder if this was the in-house entertainment they intended. I ordered a oil and garlic pie, with anchovies, sun dried tomatoes, and fresh mozzarella. Again the pie was ok, but I wish it was at least more well done than it was. Also, I didn't see any evidence of fresh mootz. Maybe, here in the south, they just don't know about that stuff? Just sayin'.",

My friend and I (both vegetarians) decided to go today for lunch, (mellow has great vegetarian options btw) this was her first time and I was excited to show her this amazing pizza place.   We get seated, get our pizza and her pizza has a piece of sausage randomly thrown on it. We are unsure so we ask our waiter Sarah what this meat is on her pizza. Sarah replies 'oh it's a piece of sausage!' very calm and excited. I explain that we are vegetarians...she said 'I'll tell my manager'   Manager Thomas comes to our table with the first words said 'hi heard y'all found a litttle piece of sausage', not to mention my friend is Muslim and it is against her religion to eat this said 'little piece of sausage', then Thomas follows up and says 'I used to work at another mellow in Cary that was full of Muslims and things like this happen bc the pizzas are made on an assembly line'..   I understand that mistakes happen but an apology would've been nice. Nobody apologized. The waitress Sarah was rude and dismissive and the manager himself was extremely dismissive, made excuses and never once apologized..   If you care about good service... don't go here. We were dismissed.",

Now the bad things, our hot wings were not their usual crispness and at least 4 of our wings were so tiny and almost unrecognizable as chicken wings the they should have never been put on a plate. They brought us a new batch and gave them to us for free but no visit from the manager however our waiter apologized. It took about 25 minutes for our pizza and when we did get it it wasn't that hot as if it had been sitting for 5 minutes before we got it.

    "text": "I have frequented many different Mellow Mushrooms and have never had a bad experience until last night. We were excited to come as we had family visiting from New York and this is usually one of our favorite places! We arrived yesterday, a Monday- at around 5pm. It wasn't busy as it was still so early. A hostess was at the stand with about three other people. I told him I needed seating for 4 adults and two children. He went to go set up the table I'm assuming for what felt like quite a long time. During that time another person even came and tried to seat us. Finally we were brought to our table and after sitting there for 15 minutes I decided to go see if a waitress or waiter was even assigned to us. I walked back to the hostess stand but no one was there, it looked like half of the staff was congregated at an empty booth on the left side of the restaurant. I walked over to ask the hostess if we had a server to which he replied \"yes you should.\" He left the group to go find someone and about ten minutes later our waitress came. She was extremely apologetic and sweet and was not one of the many staff who were standing around. She was very attentive for the rest of outer visit. The pizza was just ok, definitely not the best we've ever had. My question is where is the management? It doesn't look good to your customers to have ten staff members standing around talking while meanwhile they are sitting in a booth for 15 minutes not even being asked if they would like a drink. I also noticed two tables had customers leave and dirty dishes were just sitting on the tables for 30+ minutes... Every other Mellow Mushroom has had a very hands on manager on who walks the floor and takes pride in the establishment. Definitely didn't see that here. I would visit another location before dining here again.",

My coworkers loves this place so we typically get there once or twice a month for lunch, and every time I can't believe how long it takes to get in an out. Food typically takes over 30 minutes, regardless of what you get. The specialty pizzas are great, but at about $25 for a large is very overpriced. Not worth going in unless you're looking for a long meal.",

Mellow Mushroom has always been a favorite ever since my college days.  The tastes are consistently good.   Get the Mighty Meaty if your a carnivore like our family.  It's DA BOMB!",

    "text": "First time here. Came on a Friday night for pizza before exploring an event happening uptown. Typical Friday night crowd. We were greeted and sat right away (table for 2) by the kitchen. We were starving so as soon as the server came and greeted us we ordered our food.  With a yelp check in (or email sign up) you get feee pretzel bites so we ordered those and wanted to try a Cider from the drink menu. The sever told us they were going through transition and they didn't update the menu yet. He wasn't 100% sure what they did have but did make an effort to go back and forth between our table and the bar to ask questions about drink availability and even brought us a little sample of something.   Pretzel bites came out pretty quick and they were good!   My issue though is that after the pretzel bites came out no one came back to our table. We got to the restaurant at 8:45 PM and it was 9:53pm and still no pizza. Frustrated, we tracked down another employee walking by and asked for a pizza status update.  Turns out the kitchen hadn't even made it yet and nobody knew what happened. Apparently the ticket got lost or something.  The server never came back to the table to apologize or anything and another lady (possibly manager) came over and told us that she would take care of our bill. Technically the pretzel bites were already free so all that was covered was one angry orchard cider.   We left after wasting an hour of sitting around with no pizza, still hungry and no real apology just a comped cider.   I understand that Friday nights can get busy and that mistakes happen but I think a lot more could've been done to resolve this situation.",

Food was excellent as was the service. The calzone was huge and perfectly prepared. The pizza had a fantastic crust and was loaded with cheese. The salads however were a bit wilted.  What was most impressive though was their care and concern for a young member of our group of eight who has food allergies. After questioning or waitress about his salad dressing, the chef actually brought the container out and kindly read the ingredients to us. Now that was going above and beyond.  The atmosphere was fun and the sanitation score was a 94.5. We will return.",

Even though the place was busy we were seated immediately.   Then we waited and waited. Finally someone came over to ask if we wanted water...and then she never brought it.   Finally, our server came over and took our app, drinks and food order. She was nice but so overwhelmed. I gave up on trying to get silverware and just went back to the kitchen to get it myself.   We started with the pretzels they were good but arrived lukewarm. My friend ordered a ceasar salad and when it arrived to the table it had pineapples and olives in it?! It's sure it was as disgusting as it sounds. There wasn't really an apology for it. Our sever just wanted to know who brought it to us from the kitchen. Okay...but at least they comped it for her.   I ordered the Pacific Rim it comes with bacon, ham, pineapples and caramelized onions that I swapped out for banana peppers.   The pizza was really good. It took forever to get to the table but it was hot and fresh when it finally arrived.   So I don't know. I really liked the pizza but it didn't make up for the service and the waiting. So overall, it was a \" meh\" visit. I'm not saying I won't rerun but it may be a while.",

The restaurant wasn't full and they put us on a side where there weren't other people. I had to go up to the hostess to check on our waitress. After that it was smooth sailing. We checked in on Yelp and got the free pretzel bites which were so delicious. The cheese dipping sauce was perfectly balanced with the slightly salty pretzel bites. I think they use the same dough as their pizzas and it was perfectly fluffy bites! Next we ordered the medium bbq chicken pizza which was perfect for our group of 3 (there were 6 slices). One of the best bbq chicken pizzas I've had!",

Since then their score is now an A. We had a few drinks and ended up talking to Sydney, the owner. She was very personable and openly walked us through what happened. They now have a new GM and kitchen manager, which was really good to hear. She also gave my friend a birthday drink, which was very nice of her. Jojo our bartender and server was really good. She was very attentive to our needs the entire time, even before the owner was talking to us.   We had mimosas which were $15 bottle champagne. After checking in you get pretzel bites with a purchase of a pizza. Someone in our group got pizza so we were able to get the bites. They were really good and the cheese dip is what sets it off.  Sydney's energy and engagement with us, along with the great service from Jojo will be the reason we come back. We look forward to the changes they are making with new management.",

Especially if they can afford to put up the money for network sponsorship.  It was a late Sunday afternoon. My team (Pitt)was absolutely destroyed the previous evening, my hangover was beginning to fade. Pizza seemed to be the right comfort food considering I had already devoured southern biscuits for breakfast.  The restaurant was clean, service was exceptional, the fountain coke was sweet nectar. And that is end of all things positive.  If you're here now let me tell you. This pizza was mellow, we opted for the most mellow order a plain cheese pizza. It came out piping hot but when it cooled enough for a first bite it was the most underwhelming slice I've had since lunchables. To be completely honest I felt like I was eating a fresh diogirno pizza with a better crust. It was a struggle to split the small eight slices of pizza. I chewed, drank more coke but there was nothing helping with each bite. I just only ate the crust and left the body of each slice on the plate. Do southerners have no pride in food other than chicken, biscuits and gravy? For a chain with so many locations it's apparent why it did not extend north of the mason dixon line. Some northern specifically New York influence would certainly help resurrect the flavor of this pizza.",

I was really looking forward to the pacific rim pizza which unfortunately didn't get to try but my colleagues raves about it. I also had the house special which was also about a 7.5.

Right when we got there the girl at the front said \"sorry.... no seating inside\" ...like ok??? Are you going to offer me outside seating...? So I said it was fine and asked nicely if we could sit outside and she begrudgingly said yes. Anyway, the service was horrendous. They delivered us a dirty plate, said they'd replace it and never brought another. No napkins, no utensils. Then they forgot about our food, so that took a longgg time. A couple other things happened, but I'm giving 3 stars because the manager gave us a free bottle of wine for the trouble. They need to figure their stuff out because their food is pretty good!",

That didn't happen. Our pizza came out around 25 mins after we ordered and we had to ask 2 people about the wings. They eventually came and the waited stated they just came out but they were warm. We also had to walk to the front just to let someone know we were ready to pay.   This was very frustrating as we really enjoy the food at Mellow Mushroom. There was not a designated waiter and the food was not as good as food their locations.",

We ordered small pepperoni pizza, chicken salad sandwich, spinach artichoke dip, and a Caesar salad. 40 minutes later the sandwich came out, on a wrap instead with an apology from the manager that they had run out of the chicken salad so it was only about a quarter full. Luckily they comped it. Next up was the pizza for our 6 year old, 15 minutes after my sandwich. The waitress asked if we had her got the dip and we told her no, so she hustled and got it for us another 15 min later. For some reason the hardest for them to get out was a Caesar salad. Made no sense. Nothing else comped. Spent over two hours there at lunch. Good thing we didn't have to be anywhere after that.",

On 6/5 around 10pm we attempted to place a to-go order with this location and was told the kitchen had closed early, due to \"complications\" with the oven, yet the restaurant was full and patrons were still waiting for food.   On 6/7 we returned to place a to-go order, placed the order and spent an hour waiting, but never received our pizza. During the time we were waiting, there were patrons assembling pizza boxes, who admittedly stated they didn't work in the establishment, standing on the service counter dancing, and waiters groping and kissing on these guests in between running plates to customers. After we waited the 45 minutes I asked the to-go waitress to check on our order, she stated \"everything is in the oven\", the cooks then came around the corner and said \"don't take anymore orders\", by this time it was 11pm, another waiter spoke up and said \"they have already placed their order.\" After a full hour of waiting I decided the better option to get a refund and take my pizza craving elsewhere :(  In the future I'll make the drive to the Selwyn Ave. location to avoid any disappointments from this location.",

They have a great location, fun interior, small patio, and the food is good.  But they also have a bunch of issues.  I've had lunch here a variety of times, and every time it's unbearably slow.   (with one time the appetizer showing up the same time as the main meal.)  With the staff, I always get the feeling that they are in a rush.  As soon as they approach my table, they are in a hurry to leave.  It's strange and not a very friendly experience.  Also, the patio is great, when you can keep away the drifters and homeless.  In one visit, had 2 homeless men browsing the patio area for leftovers, and one even SAT DOWN at a table and ate.  It was a really awkward experience for me as he was in my line of sight and stared at me the whole time.  The waitresses definitely noticed him and didn't do anything about it.  Until this location can get it together, I'll be heading to the Myers Park location.",

    "text": "I really wish I was writing a \"Hooray!\" but I'm not. The Uptown location wasn't my first rodeo with the Mushroom and won't be my last.  The Mushroom is usually solid artisan pizza, just not this time.  I started visiting different Mellow Mushrooms about ten years ago.  The Jerk pizza has always been my \"go-to.\"  I went to the Uptown location for a business lunch.  Not too bad.  We got seated in less than a minute.  The menu didn't have my favorite, but I'm the type of person that is willing to try many different things.  So I asked our waitress for a recommendation and was led to the Mellowterranean.  A grilled chicken pizza with onions, roasted red peppers, black olives, chives, feta, mozzarella and tzatziki sauce.  Sounds like a homerun eh?  Two things to note about this pizza:  Gigantic roasted red pepper laid out on the pizza.  This isn't convenient to eat, and the texture and amount just make this strange and unappealing.  Second, yes, the tzatziki is pretty tasty, but I found myself using it to cover up the other tastes.  A condiment should compliment, not be needed to cover up the  the rest of the dish.  Lastly, the cheese bread appetizer.  Oh how I laughed.  The look on my associate's face was priceless.  To quote, \"Is this cheese on hot-dog buns?\"  Lol...I almost spit water out my nose when he said that.  To be fair, what we were brought, looked nothing...and I do mean...nothing...like the picture you see on Yelp.  Maybe they were out of bread and went with the old \"McGuyver that shit\" method...but \"hot-dog buns\" is being nice about it.  So why three stars if the whole experience was less than decent?  Because I know the Mellow Mushroom as a whole.  I know that this is the only experience I've had that was disappointing.  Maybe it was an off day, maybe it was blah blah blah.  Regardless of what it was, I'd go back and expect things to be a much better experience.  Would I recommend or order what I've had?  Not a chance, but I wouldn't exclude them from my list of pizza joints based on one bad experience either.",

I got the hummus for an app and veggie calzone for dinner. My husband had the traditional wings for an app and a medium two meat pizza. We were not disappointed! Being from NJ originally I've had the privilege to sample some really mouthwatering calzones from both Philly and NYC, this surpassed! It was flavorful and not too doughy so you could really taste the filling of the calzone. The hummus was also very well flavored with basil and olive oil served some soft pita chips. My husbands wings were mild (he's unable to do spicy foods) and only had a slight kick, but were tender and basically falling off the bone. As for his pizza, again not real doughy but the crust was cooked well and it was not soggy from the grease from the meats.   There are three things that really impressed us while we were there: 1) Even packed full of out-of-towners and football fans, the staff was so nice and our server Dean was OUTSTANDING! 2) the meats, vegetables and cheese were fresh! 3) (this is amazing to only me) but there are so many vegan and vegetarian options! We can get & enjoy more then a salad!!!   If you visit the area and enjoy good food this place is outstanding! A must try!",

Anyway, I've always been pleased with the meals I have had at this location. It's usually very timely and cooked perfectly. I love the original plain jane pepperoni but their specialty pies are always on point! The staff is a occasionally on the lackadaisical side but I'm in a place with 'shrooms on the wall sooo....yeah.

    "text": "First Review! Yayy!  So, I love a good Mellow Mushroom. This is the third location I've been to in Charlotte, and they just opened this uptown location on Monday, I learned. Just like the others in Charlotte, it's fancy schmancy. I can foresee this location being particularly busy, especially during basball and football seasons as it is right between both stadiums and across from the \"French Quarter\".  I was surprised that they weren't busier, but the server/bartender we had told us that this was still considered their \"soft opening\" week, and there hadn't been much advertising yet. Come Sunday, when the Panthers take on the NO Saints at home, they'll get more business than they are ready for...  Anyhow the more important piece of this review- the drink, food, and service: Well, they've got quite a solid selection of taps, but half of the tap line was down due to issues with the refrigeration sysytem, so no OH Death By Hops for me. (Waah) It's okay though- I went with a  Bell's 3rd Coast Barleywine instead. YUM. You don't see this beer around much in these parts. Fair warning, if you order a beer that is over 7.0% ABV (Bell's Two Hearted) be prepared for a smaller pour. I can understand this notion for the 10% beer I was drinking, but for the Foothills Jade IPA (only 7.4%) I drank later, I think a small pour is silly, in my humble beer drinking opinion.  The food was just alright on this visit. The bruschetta was lacking in flavor, and the toppings seemed a little scant. I did however like the way they toasted the bread, it was the perfect balance of crunchy and soft. The pizza was alright, but not as amazing as other Mellow Mushroom pizza i'd had before. My friend could not decide which kind she wanted, so we went halfsies and got the Holy Shiitake and Redskin combo. Didn't seem like as many toppings as I'm used to seeing on a Mellow pie, and again, the flavors were lacking.  Service was great. We sat at the bar, and were greeted immediately by a friendly Ray and a friendly Taylor. Both were very accomodating, and offered samples to my not-so-beer-savvy comrade. They get two thumbs up.   If Yelp offered the half star rating, i'd go 3.5/5. There's room for improvement, but understanding its only the first week of business, I'll come back once they get settled. They're open til 4 am on the weekends, which is crucial after the clubs and bars all close and there's nowhere else to go when you're drunk hungry.",

    "text": "So, I have mixed feelings about my experience at Mellow Mushroom. First off, there were plenty of tables open on a Thursday night which was great because we were seated right away. The bad news is that we didn't have the nicest server and the wait for the food was ridiculously long, about 45 minutes. However, the beer cheese was delicious to dip the parmesean pretzel bites in. (or so my husband told me) I ordered the gluten free crust which only comes in a 12 inch and is very thin. Unfortunately if you order a specialty pizza on gluten free crust, it sets you back about $20 per pizza. The redskin potato pizza was delightful and really different! The mellowterannean was amazing because it comes with Tzaki dipping sauce. Yes please! I would come back if they could speed up the service because I haven't had a better gluten free-vegan crust (they use Smart Flour!) I also like the location uptown next to the super cute park  and the funky ambience inside.",

    "text": "This Mellow Mushroom typically provides a faster service than the usual Mellow Mushroom thanks to it being uptown with people usually only on an hour break to stop-in, grab a salad or pizza and go back.  My typical visit to this location is during the lunch hour, so this is a good thing; though if the place is very busy, the kitchen slows down, but that is expected.  Diners can be seated indoors and out or can opt to seat yourself at the bar.  This location offers daily lunch specials and discounts to nearby businesses (i.e. Duke Energy, Wells Fargo, etc.) on certain days.  This location also has a stamp card that offers a free meal after 8-10 visits.  Generally, service at this location is good; if mistakes happen, they will make another pizza/salad or reduce your bill.  The pizzas are fantastic, no question.  The sourdough like bread with a strong tomato sauce has a unique taste no other pizza place I've been to has replicated.  Though simple pizzas can be ordered, their menu features signature pizzas that have chicken, pesto, and a lot of other nontraditional toppings... and of course various types mushrooms.  The only negative is that the build-your-own pizza can be most expensive, so its best to order the signatures, if you see one you like (I typically get the Mighty Meaty).  Please note that they will also add Parmesan cheese on top of all their pizzas.  I don't order salads, but I have been told by friends that they are good too.  They serve Coke products at this location.  Their sweet tea is generally water-down bad, so skip it.  Full bar and a good selection of beers on tap.    The style of the place is not as fancy as other locations, slightly spartan.  Lots of televisions around the bar area and around the restaurant.  Free Wi-Fi, when it allows you to connect.  Price is going to be higher than average, but worth it.  Overall give it four out of five; it is one of the better Mellow Mushroom around.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "My husband and I came here last Wednesday before heading to a Charlotte Knights game.   The location is super convenient (we walked so I can't speak to parking) to alot of areas in Uptown. The restaurant was fairly busy but we were able to grab a seat outside. It feels a bit odd cause the restaurant isn't decorated like your typical Shroom location. It feels like they may have just tried a bit too hard to get that Uptown feel.  The beer list is fairly large with a good amount of local selections. I had a Red Oak (my go to beer of choice!) and my husband had a Porter or Stout....must have spaced out while he ordered cause I have no idea what he had!  Since we have recently been trying to eat less meat, we ordered a medium pizza off their speciality summer menu (I believe it was called Tempeh-rarily...or something like that!). It was delish! Tempeh, artichoke, pineapple, mushrooms, pesto, and an olive oil base! A medium was perfect size for us. Actually, it may have been a bit too large.  Food was delish and exactly what we expected from a Mellow Mushroom. However, service was awful! We were there almost 2 hours with 80% of it just waiting. Normally, it wouldnt be a huge deal, but we were trying to get to a Knights game and ended up getting there at the bottom of the 6th inning because of the super long wait. The waitress was super sweet when we chatted with her, but for the most part she was MIA.   We will absolutely return, just not when we are in a rush!",

I placed an order for the Teriyaki Chicken hoagie, I was kinda in a rush so I ordered the half sandwich thinking that it will only take a few minutes... Wrong!!! 15 to 20 minutes for a HALF SANDWICH to be made... Really?!!! I got it anyway. I left to go pick up a few things while they were preparing my food; came back, the server said it was going to be an additional 5 minutes for my sandwich to be ready!    At this point I'm getting pissed off due to the fact that I only have 3 minutes left on my lunch and my sandwich is not ready. The guy who took my order apologized for the delay and spoke to his manager about the matter. A lot of apologies and at the end I got a refund along with my sandwich... Thank you!    30 minutes later, I finally got the chance to sit down and eat my sandwich that I waited so long for to eat... Here's were my anger falls into play, I go to take a bite out of my sandwich and a couple pieces of meat falls out the bottom of my sandwich... One piece in particular STOOD OUT! \"The Hell is that?\"... Is that a hair?!!!! Sigh!... I waited for this sandwich all to have a hair in my damn sandwich!     Fast forward to 5 minutes later... I wrapped up the piece of chicken with the beautiful luxurious piece of hair on it called Mellow Mushroom and asked to speak with the manager about the situation that unfolded before me. Took the sandwich back and again had a lot of apologies and offered me a new sandwich with 2 $5 gift cards and a bottle of water for the wait.     Got my sandwich and walked away with my water and 2 gift cards... But over all this was my 2nd bad experience with them and I don't know if I'll spend my money here again because of it. Hey! It's just my experience and I thought I would share it, maybe yours could be different.",

    "text": "I was here twice during a weekend as lunch prior to a festival Uptown.  Rather than pay for expensive festival food and cheap beer, I figured this was a good opportunity to check out this Mellow Mushroom and their beer selection.  The restaurant decor lacks the funkiness of some of their other locations and is more trendy which is popular Uptown.  Gone is the MM soul with the funky characters surrounding the restaurant.  The first visit, I say at the bar.  They had just opened for the day and were still getting ready for the day so service actually seemed a little slow.  They have a huge beer selection on tap. You are bound to find something you like. For a meal, I went with a large greek salad. And let me tell you, it was quite large and very tasty but it was so large, I could not finish it.   The 2nd visit, I sat in a booth at the front of the restaurant. Again, I caught them when they had just opened and apparently they clean the entire restaurant on Sundays around lunch time. They were cleaning the booths/tables around me and it was a bit annoying because it wasn't just 1 person, it was 6 and it was very distracting.  And then I went ignored. It took forever to get a water glass refilled and also forever to get my check.  I ordered the Magical Mystery Tour pizza this time around. It was loaded with veggies and I love MM's pizza dough but again it was huge and I could only finish half of the pizza.  The food is great here but both times there were service issues. Apparently cleaning and prepping here means you can ignore your paying customers.  Service is what stopped this from being a 4-star review.",

    "text": "My friend and I went to the Uptown location Saturday hoping to enjoy some delicious pizza after working all night. We walked in the restaurant at exactly 11:24pm. The restaurant is supposed to be open until midnight; I like to specify that the RESTAURANT is supposed to be open until midnight, not the bar, the restaurant and bar. We were greeted by the host who told us that the restaurant was no longer serving menu items and that they were only serving by the slice. I then asked if I could get a slice of any of the pizza options they normally serve and he said no they only had pepperoni and cheese. I used to work in the restaurant industry, and in NO way is it justified to completely close your kitchen down and only serve pepperoni and cheese slices when you still have 35 minutes left until you close. Since my friend and I had walked across town to get pizza, we just decided to suck it up and get a slice. We were then told that we had to sit in the bar area. So they had COMPLETELY shut down the entire restaurant sitting areas except for the bar area. They weren't allowing anyone to sit at a table or in a booth section. The bar area was the only place we were allowed to sit and it was packed to where I don't even think there was a place to sit, let alone eat comfortably. I do want to say that we do not blame the host at all, he was only doing his job and notifying us. I think it is unacceptable that when your place of business has 35 minutes left to serve food, you close your menu and sitting areas down and only serve pepperoni and cheese slices and in 1 area, the bar. We decided to just leave and take our money elsewhere and ate at Peculiar Pizza.",

    "text": "Coworker dinner at Mellow Mushroom preceded a work outing to the baseball game & location was perfect.  Our waiter was also *incredibly* efficient & patient w/ our large rowdy group & he alone deserves extra props for our fun evening  Drinkys included Elderflower somethingorother that had bourbon, elderflower & tea - it was pretty okay; cosmos got raves & lots & lots of beers which ranged from tap to bottles & all declared good (even though it was of the Coors & Miller varieties)  Started w/ the Pretzels - these were in reality breadsticks that had been shaped into a pretzel shape.  There was no crispy / chewy outside & soft inside.......but giving credit where it's due, the description of these \"pretzels\" state it's their pizza crust baked up like a pretzel.    Also shared multiple orders of the Bruschetta & they were the hit of the table - loved the fresh tomatoes  Entrees included salads & different varieties of their pizzas - being the only veggie in the group has its benefits b/c I got to order a whole pie for myself & that choice was the Shiitake Pizza - supposed to have shiitakes, portabellos & different cheeses, all drizzled in truffle oil.  In reality, there were few mushrooms & I didn't really discern *any* shiitakes & no indication of truffle.....but it was a nice mushroom pizza & I liked the ranch they put all over it - yay for the South & how we like our ranch!  Other pizza orders included a standard pepperoni, the Potato Skins Pizza (by far the winner of the table) and the White pizza which had fresh tomatoes & ricotta  Overall = decent pizza - maybe a bit too bready & chewy but wouldn't turn it down if the option presented itself",

    "text": "I have been to several Mellow Mushroom establishments. Met up with some friends prior to attending an event.  The location is right in Uptown Charlotte and Happy Hour is filled with locals after work.  The layout and design of this restaurant is contemporary and lots of flat screen TV at first it felt like a sports bar.   Mellow Mushroom makes delicious pizza. Had the Magical Mystical Tour and the Jalapeno kicker. The second pizza was a bit too hot for me. Not use to eating Jalapeno.  When we ordered the pizza's the waitstaff said it was going to take 10- 15 minutes or more to get to the table. It was also a 10 minute wait for the dessert. The Half Baked Brownie Supreme came but we were still waiting for the three pretzels. The brownie was a tad dry around the edges but with a teaspoon of ice cream and whip cream it made it very moist.  We had to leave for a show and went to the counter to ask the pretzels be wrapped to go.  If you were not in a rush or had ample time to relax and unwind after work then this is the happening place to be.",

    "text": "Eating here is the closest you can get to gambling in Charlotte. It will either be absolutely delicious or a giant waste of money. We lived in the apartments above Mellow for two years and ate it far more than we should have. Probably spent thousands of dollars over two years. It was so convenient. That is why they have as much business as they do, unless its a game day. I feel bad for the new manager to some extent. Mind you, there is often a new manager. Like there are ALWAYS new employees. Our last visit, post-living upstairs, we ordered salted pretzel bites to go when we were leaving a Hornets game. We got there and they were ready. Except, they were parmesan, not salted. This would have been no issue if I didn't want any, but I like the salt and don't eat the parmesan at all. They said they would get a new order \"right out\". 45 minutes later I'm standing up because I'm about to demand a refund and leave and they come running over with my new order. I was so furious, I was almost shaking. The manager asked if I'm the one that just left the bad review....yes, because you left me sitting here for 45 minutes waiting on pretzel bites so I had some free time to leave a bad review. At that point, I was so tired and annoyed, I didn't even eat any and my boyfriend who would have preferred the parmesan had he known that I wasn't going to eat any, ate a few and also became annoyed and we threw them out. When the kitchen screws up an order, let's not be on Facebook reading notifications and be out here making sure the customer is getting their order corrected quickly and before those that just walked in the door. So disappointed that some place with service this bad can do so well.",

I think the quality of the food is absolutely different when there are more people (worse).  One funny note - if you know the Panthers have a practice in the afternoon  it is a fun time to checkout the bar area.  No, not to meet the Panthers.  To see the single ladies who come in dressed in some amazing outfits and sit at the bar by themselves HOPING to meet a Panther.",

The decor is very \"mushroomy\" if that makes sense. The patio area outside is spacious and offers wonderful views of the adjacent park.   I love that they have Abita Root Beer on tap. It is absolutely delicious! My favorite thing to get here is the Buffalo Chicken pizza. I love that they give you blue cheese dressing or ranch to dip your pizza in. It gives it the perfect added taste! I have had subs here for lunch and they are also good. This is a good place to get a pizza. They have a lot of creative options aside from your standard toppings.",

    "text": "We were next door at Romare Bearden Park and decided to get some takeout we could eat in the night air while enjoying a jazz band. With the concert and a baseball game going on, we expected a long wait.   Before we ordered, we were told it would be an hour to get anything for takeout - which was ok due to our expectations.   I ordered the Magical Mystery Tour which has Pesto base with button and Portobello mushrooms, feta and mozzarella cheeses, spinach and jalapenos on a pesto basted crust. A medium was about $20. I asked for jalapenos on half. When we picked it up, about an hour later, they were helpful with napkins, plates and anything else we needed.   Verdict - great flavor, and an abundance of toppings - on half. The half with jalapenos was loaded up. The other half looked naked. Flavor was fantastic, but was extremely disappointed that for $20, they couldn't get both halves to look the same. The no jala side had maybe two mushrooms - and no spinach. If it had been even, I'd have said it was worth the price.",

There was a 2-top and a 4-top open behind us.  We got wings for an appetizer and they were hands down the worst we've ever had. So dry and tasteless. Only got 5 and are 2... Barely. They took them away and we told the waitress but she said said \"ok\" (not letting us know if it would be handled / free).   After we are no one came up to clear our plates or offer a box. We waited until someone came up so we could order dessert but the bartenders just stood there talking to each other. 35 minutes later someone finally came up and we ordered then.  Never coming back... One of worst Mellow Mushrooms ice ever been to.",
