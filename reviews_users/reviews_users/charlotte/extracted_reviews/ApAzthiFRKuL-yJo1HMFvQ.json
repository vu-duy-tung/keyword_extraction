It's just a shame that they decided to stuff the band downstairs where it was a 90 degree hot box! We would have stayed longer if we hadn't felt ourselves melting! Food was delicious and the service was great once the servers found us out in the random unairconditioned hallway! Will definitely think twice about going next time if the band plays in the hotbox!",

We had such a great time and Tracy clinched us coming back again in the near future.",

Meat flavored okay, but sandwich lacks. Homemade chips good, but sauce is thinned down ranch dressing. Onion straws very good, fish tacos good. Major problem is service. Understaffed? Don't know but it took 15 mins for server to even come near us and we had to grab her attention to ask for drinks. She complied but acted unwilling at first and took her time reappearing and seemed distracted all night. Won't return.",

The staff here has always been very accomodating and while the bar area can get packed quick there is plenty of seating towards the back.    The decor is pretty much typical sports bar and I think this is a West Virignia University loyal bar too (for those that care) as well as UNC - Tarheels.  The downstairs is also a good spot for a business meeting or social event.  I've been to a few there and it's nice and roomy.    I've only tried food there a couple times and never had a bad experience but mostly a fan of their deli wraps.  Can't really screw that up though.    One other nice thing is that this bar is one that is pretty well intertwined into the social media scene and has regular 'tweetups' for twitter followers that want to socialize....cool :)",

The omelets are great.  Bacon can be a little undercooked.  (Which seems to be a North Carolina thing because I can't get truly crispy bacon anywhere except at diners.)

I went on a Thursday during lunch because it is so close to my work, so maybe I would be more WOW-ed by the atmosphere if I came on a game day or late at night on a weekend. I was impressed with the Cajun seasoned grilled chicken BLT sandwich though which was on special the day that I went. And their drink specials seemed decent. Even mid day on a Thursday parking was tricky so highly consider ubering here if you can. Also, hold your breath as you're walking in because they share a front entrance, foyer like area, with a cross fit work out place which is downstairs and you are immediately bombarded by an overwhelming smell of stale sweat and old locker room fumes.  So, try to sit outside in their nice patio area and stay for the drink specials!",

    "text": "Sorry in advance for the really long review!  I really wish I could give Dilworth Neighborhood Grille more stars, but after last night we won't be back.  We have been patrons of DNG for the last 4 or so years as they are the bar for UT alumni and their football games.  I do not understand why UT has not received the memo that it is time to look for another bar, most other schools have - Uga, Auburn, wva, Msu, and others have all left.  It is now only UT and NCSU, as far as I know, which says a lot if a lot of groups are leaving.  I will say that DNG is a nice spot to grab a bite to eat when an event or alumni/team group is not there.  We like their food and have had a lot of their menu items, although disappointed they changed their menu last year and took off our favorite item.  The housemade buffalo chips are great!  My issue?  When they have a large showing like us UT fans, they are NEVER prepared and do not have enough servers - usually only 2-3 servers. It has not changed from year to year.   Last night was no different and our server was the worst we have had.  We (5 of us) were greeted early on, but then there was a long wait to get our drinks.  Kevin's sweet tea came first, then eventually my bar drink came, then eventually the other two bar drinks came (after finally being told that they were out of one beer), and finally a diet coke.  It was probably another 20-30 minutes before she came back to take our order.  The three others with us had their dinner served to them 10+ minutes before the sandwich that Kevin and I were sharing came out.  When she finally came by to check on us, Kevin asked for a refill on sweet tea.  She checked on us about 3 more times before finally coming back with a refill of unsweet tea...  Took awhile for her to come back for us to notify her about the mistake.  Again took a couple reminders to get sweet tea.  I wish I was off, but it took around 40-50 minutes before she finally got the sweet tea refill.   She told the manager how bad she was and he came by to offer a beer or dessert for him, but we were not interested at the time.  How about offer the sweet tea on the house, instead of charging us for it?!?   We decided 5 minutes before half we wanted to leave at half.  Since she had not come by our table in awhile we sent one of our people to track her down to pay.  She got two out of the three checks and asked if the third person wanted their check...really?? She did not return and we had to again ask her for the third check.  Halftime was over before we finally paid out.  Beyond that, they need more tv's.  Having only 4-5 in a dining area is pretty crappy for a sports bar.  DNG needs to get more servers or get backups to just come around to help with refills or make sure people have what they need.  They have yet to fix this issue each year, it is no different each game.  We enjoy going to be with other ut fans, but it is not worth it when they can't handle a crowd.  I'm disappointed we brought our guests to a place like this.  Goodbye DNG!",

The burger (which I ordered rare knowing it would continue to cook in transit) was not good. It came in well done.... the avocado on it was not even near ripe. I also ordered wings char grilled. My wings were not char grilled. They actually look like another review where they ordered normal wings. I'm sorry but I'm not paying extra to not have them char grilled. Fries were ok but nothing special. Mine were actually not even crunchy. They were undercooked. Ultimately a total disappointment. Especially since the delivery took under 5 min from order completion to my door. Definitely not the drivers fault there",

    "text": "My guy and I came here the other night for trivia night on Tuesdays. I really liked it and to be honest could see myself coming here a lot more often on nice summer nights. I pass by this bar all the time and until the other night had no idea they have a outside bar seating area that allows you to sit at the bar but outside at the same time which is one of my favorite features of any bar. Clearly we were the new kids on the block for trivia night as everyone knew each other and at first it kinda felt like we walked in on some exclusive bingo club like the ones my grandpa used to go to but with younger people. Thankfully that feeling subsided really quickly as we had mentioned to the host when we ran in that we had come for trivia and we were like 3 mins late and rushed to the bar. Side note on that if you come to trivia night they start on time so don't be late or you could miss multiple questions they go by REALLY quickly.  I think the host could tell we had no idea what we were doing so he grabbed the needed sheets for trivia and brought them to us which was much appreciated that he went out of his way to help us out for being late and the bartender greeted us and told us the specials. They have 12 dollar beer pitchers on Tuesdays! We also had some food as well my guy had the cali burger I think it was called which he devoured before I could try it and he said it was pretty good. I had the beer cheese dip with a large soft pretzel to dip into it. It was just ok to be honest I couldn't really taste the beer in it it kinda just tasted like queso dip.  I have had the crab cakes on another occasion and would suggest that for an app over the dip for sure as those I do remember being really good.   Service was great and theres plenty of parking. This place was a little pricey compared to other places as we spent $70 on just the two of us before tip but it was definitely a good time and well be back for sure.",

MY GOD. Perfect seasoning on both dishes, and with the perfect portion sizes!  However, a coworker sitting across from me decided to go with a veggie flatbread, and that will definitely be my next dish to try.  I say this because I will be back. Especially for that 10am-2pm BRUNCH BUFFET on Sundays. :p",

I will be going back for more bbq and mac-n-cheese.  Maybe even one of the signature salads! Parking is tough.

The Asian chicken salad was ok-the best part of it was the dressing. The grilled chicken was not seasoned and also was not served warm.

The patio is large with several TVs and tables as well as high tops.  Our server was very friendly, but unfortunately somewhat MIA. Very hard to track him down and somewhat distracted when it came to getting us what we needed. I chose the Chicken Philly, which first let me say was huge. So, large portions which can be a plus. However, it didn't taste good at all. Not sure if they burned the mushrooms, onions and peppers, or if they were bad, but there was just a bad aftertaste in my mouth. Definitely wouldn't order that again.  The others got the Steak Philly and Black Bean burger.  Overall they said they were okay, but don't think the Black Bean burger was a hit. I will however say the Fries and Onion Strings are great! Overall it was nice to come back, since it has been years, but definitely not somewhere I would return to for dinner anytime soon. There is definitely better \"bar\" food elsewhere.",

Although our server was nice, she forgot our wine, forgot our appetizer, and decided to sweep the patio instead of bring our checks when we were done. I try not to complain, especially when using a Groupon and getting discounted food, but when the manager came over to redeem the Groupon he asked how everything was. I let him know the food was great, but service was not. No questions asked, he handled the situation very professionally. For that I will be back.   Food was actually pretty good! I would say we started with the buffalo blue chips, but they came after our entrees. Still good though! I ordered the Southwest Salad with blackened shrimp instead of chicken and added avocado. It came with more shrimp than I expected and the dressing was great! Boyfriend ordered the Cuban and said it was alright. Their Sauvignon Blanc is very sweet-- would not get again.   Definitely going to give this place another chance!",

Dilworth truly has a cool spot and I believe it is one of the most underrated patio situations in Charlotte!! The space is very large and their bar extends outside. When it is warmer, they lift the covering and you are in open air with a bar and tvs surrounding you! Additionally, they have a downstairs area that was being utilized for a private event when we were there.....definitely got some laughs from the noon time Sweet Sixteen dance party that was ensuing as we arrived!  They have a very nice beer selection as well. Typically I just go for Red Oak, as that is my drink of choice. On this particular occasion, my husband went for the Red Oak and I got the mojito in a mason jar as it was on special. The mojito was very nicely made and delish.  We decided to split the Ahi Tuna wrap with a caesar salad as our side, as we weren't too crazy hungry. The salad was very good and nice portion for a side. The wrap was very tasty with lots of seared ahi tuna inside.   Great spot that may become a regular outdoor seating option!",

I hope management reads this and removes this tumor before she infects any of the other staff.

She shouldn't be anywhere near customers as she clearly doesn't have the desire to be of service.

This is the USA Swimming Officials hang out since it's just a few blocks away from the Mecklenburg Aquatic Center. As a matter of fact this Dilworth Neighborhood Grille has been a sponsor of the Grand Prix Swim Meet for several years.  Dilworth has there own private lot and when really busy I am unsure where customers park, it must be challenged. I never see any debris in the lot and it always seems like things are tidy on the exterior of the building.  I can honestly say after repeated visits there is a high level of consistency in both food and service. I have not had a poor service, or meal that I have not thoroughly enjoyed. The tap beer selection is solid with variety of NC Craft, IPA and domestics.   The atmosphere is fun and pub like around the bar. The dining room is more restaurant like and is suitable for children as they do have a kids menu. The adult menu is what you would pretty much expect and pub like with sandwiches and burgers. There are dinner dishes as well, but I have never tried them. They have some tasty appetizers like wings too.  It is not uncommon for large parties, banquets etc. to book here. They can accommodate a large party with special rooms and this usually does not distract from the customer service experience. However, on my last day in Charlotte a wedding party of around 30 hit the bar at once. It appeared to be a challenge, but I did not see where they could not handle.   I would encourage you to give Dilworth Neighborgood Grille a try if you have never experienced. I personally am a fan and will be back the next time in the area.",

If you are looking for good burgers, wraps, salads, etc. with or without a couple of drinks, this is a great spot for it.",

    "text": "Dilworth Neighborhood Grille is right behind my apartment building and there have been quite a few times where I have wondered about it but hadn't ventured over and boy do I regret not going sooner!  The bartender makes a perfect French martini and the food is good. I shared the artichoke spinach dip and it was as to be expected but what truly blew me away was the spaghetti dish. The portion was huge but it was perfectly cheesy and truly delicious. My boyfriend had one of their sandwiches and it was extremely good as well.  The service was as to be expected. We made the mistake of asking to be seated in the main dining room instead of the bar area and the waitress did make an effort to come check on us consistently.   I will definitely be back for the spaghetti again soon!",

Atmosphere is ok. Fun on game days, but I feel as though this place needs some serious updating.   Good beer selection. Beer, wine, and liquor drinks are all relatively cheap. They were having a wine tasting the night I was there which we enjoyed.   Overall, not my spot. I won't go unless invited by a friend. There are just other places I'd rather be.",

    "text": "First time trying this place today. My first impression was that the environment was really relaxed and it seemed like a cool place to grab dinner and some drinks with friends.   I ordered the Berkeley Salad which consisted of spinach, carrots, onions, strawberries, mandarin, and smoked salmon with an Asian ginger oil dressing. I personally didn't think the strawberries mixed well with the Asian taste but they were tasty in the side. The salmon was pretty tasty although the cut was a bit small. Overall I did enjoy my food but I think the ginger oil dressing was a little too much oil for me. I'd recommend an Italian dressing or basalmic vinaigrette.    The service was pretty poor, our waiter in particular. He was very clueless the entire time and took a long time to get our orders. When my friend asked about an item on the menu he basically said he wasn't sure what exactly is all in it. He also never came back to check on us or refill our drinks. Three other women did come to our table to check up on us but that was kind of confusing because I had no idea who they were and if they worked there. They would spring up out if the blue.   Maybe we just got bad luck with bad service on the first day. I would like to try some of their other food items. Hopefully next time the service will be a lot better.",

We were in the downstairs space (great for private parties and events) but the food was decent.  The event was for a running crowd so we loaded up on pasta, salad, and proteins.  It was your typical buffet line catering deal, but they still did a good job with the food (in my opinion).  The servers were very nice and came around with refills (even though I don't think they had to).  I will have to come scope out the bar scene or maybe catch a game or two here later.  The one minus is the parking situation is a bit tight... it was a weeknight when we had our event and the combined regular customers with our special event packed the parking lot.",

I don't want to be sitting by some loud guys objectifying women, dealing coke, and going around the corner to smoke weed.  All around a shoddy establishment that cares very little for the customer.  Most food comes in frozen, even their \"fresh never frozen\" wings, and all of their desserts are out of a box. Disgusting. Don't waste your time on this place.",

    "text": "I hadn't been to Dilworth Neighborhood Grille in years before last night... I had a pretty good time, that being said...  First, they offer (or offered last night, due to the charity event, not sure which) a complimentary valet service... The lack of parking situation hasn't gotten any better since the last time I'd been, so that's a welcome change... From what I remember, the lot is pretty small so if there was a relatively decent crowd or the Big Chill (are they even open anymore?) was also having an event, it was a nightmare...   They haven't changed the interior at all, but honestly, why would you?  There's a little foyer and you can choose to go right down the stairs or to the right directly into a bar and there's a room that can be reserved a little further back past the bar on the first floor as well... It's a nice size, I'm sure you can hire it out for a party and whatnot... (I think I heard someone say they did that last night...) The bar is basic... Lots of wood, seating and televisions... Decent spacing, so that's a plus... The stairs leading to the downstairs dining area has railings on the left side, right side and down the middle which is awesome for when you're wearing platform stilettos and drinking... You can never have too many handrails... (Trust me; I've seen some things... Use the help when it's offered, ladies... lol)  The food was tasty... I enjoyed the little Chick-Fil-A-like nugget situations and the barbeque sauce was good... The pepperoni pizza was hot and fresh (perfect), but I could not get the blasted thing cut to pick up the pieces properly! lol  It took a little work, but it was worth it... I'm a big tomato fan and their sauce tastes like a thickened tomato soup to me, so that was right up my alley... Not a lot of additional seasonings, but it was a good eat... The crust could use a little something, though... Maybe some garlic or parmesan?  I couldn't have the meatballs (April 1st seems so far away...), but the boyfriend said they were just okay... We both enjoyed the spinach dip... If there were any artichokes in there, I straight missed them... It stood on its own, though... Creamy, but not too creamy... If it had a little bit of red or black pepper, I think it would have been perfect... We had the Goose Island IPA and the 312 for beers and they were yummy...  Overall, it was nifty and I'll probably head back when they have specials or something...",

There was one other table with people sitting - lots of staff around the bar and in and out of the room - but no one made it over to us.  After 15 minutes - I checked - a guy came over and asked if anyone had helped us?  No.  Okay - I'll check and see where your waitress is.  5 more minutes and another girl comes over with a backpack on - like her shift is ending - same question - have you been helped?  No - she goes and gets us menus and waters and says she'll check on our waitress.  After dropping off the menus, our waitress K pops up - hi guys sorry for the confusion (there's no one in the restaurant mind you) do you know what you like to drink?  Uh - we just got our menus.  K - Oh would you like to know the specials?  yeah that'd be great.  It was 1/2 price bottles of wine - we selected one.  She comes back with bottle open - she doesn't know how to uncork a bottle of wine and said she didn't know how to pour it either.  This isn't a fine dining establishment - so whatever.  We had to ask for a wine bottle chiller.  Then she asks if we want to order anything to eat - we all do - I said - hey if I get nachos would you eat some?  My friends say yes, so K says great - nachos - I'll go put that in - she was gone before anyone else could order.  Sigh.  Nachos arrive - unspectacular and clearly not enough toppings.  My friend asks if we can have some salsa ... it arrives in a salad dressing cup.  Uh - can we have another ... another salad dressing cup shows up. It's hard to mess up nachos, but these are unremarkable.  As we're finishing up she asks if we want another bottle of wine or anything else to drink.  Our friend asks if she orders another bottle, can she cork it and take the rest home because my other friend and I want to order a beer.  She says of course.  Beers come ... this bottle comes cork missing - K tried to open it herself and destroyed the cork.  Bartender comes over 5 minutes later and tells us he's brought us the wrong beers.  Brings the rights one and takes the others away ... K finds a cork for the bottle - friend has to ask for a bag to carry it out.  I suggest that my friend review the bill to make sure it's correct given how our evening has gone.  Final blow ... we got charged $1.00 for the salsa.  At least I was out with friends.",

While it's not a terrible place I wish those groups would pick somewhere else less congested.  After going to similar bars like your Hickory Tavern, Fox & Hound, Jocks N Jills, etc. where parking is ample and in most cases a bigger bar area.  Here parking can be a nightmare with all the sports in the lot occupied during bigger events.  During events with larger groups its often difficult to get a server's attention.  To be the clear the staff clearly works very hard- some of them doing a lot running up and down steps- but with limited space and too many people its difficult for them to provide quality service.  Given that in terms of price, menu offerings and food quality there's really not a big difference from these and the aforementioned places I don't know why you would pick this place during popular bar hours unless you have a thing for enjoy parking lot congestion and having to elbow people away to get to the bathroom.  With Sunday ticket Panthers fans would be well advised to stay clear of this place when pretty every bar in town will have the game.",

And the sauce that does with it is good. I ordered the Italian Chicken Wrap and my sister got the Greek Chicken Pita Wrap. Both were delicious.",

    "text": "As far as neighborhood restaurants go, Dilworth Grille is one of the best casual spots to visit.  Here's why...  1. The atmosphere is lively and fun!  Great place to catch a game with friends, or come by yourself and make new friends as you're bonding over football.  2. The drink selection is pretty solid.  Bonus that I can get a mimosa on a Sunday and not be judged for not having a beer.  3. The food is very good.  This isn't gourmet by any means.  For a casual restaurant, their food gets two thumbs up.  Not only is the food quality good, but they have a great menu that has something for everyone.  The wings have a few interesting sauces.  The salads are a large portion and fresh.  The sandwiches are super yummy.  Prices are reasonable.  The parking can be a bit crazy.  If you're going to spend the afternoon day drinking on a Sunday, I would take an Uber and get there early.  This place gets really popular right before a Panthers game!  Good thing for the outside patio seating and plenty of TVs.",

I reseached to see who would be open and had reasonable prices. I also didn't want to get dressed up. I zoned in on DNG. I made a reservation. When we arrived, we were seated in the bar area. I was glad we was not in the same room as the set up because I would have eaten too much! I was impressed with the Thanksgiving buffet!  Mac and cheese  Sauteed spinach Mashed potatoes Stuffing  Bacon Green bean casserole  Sweet Potato casserole Popcorn chicken Crabcake Fried turkey  Baked turkey Salad bar Fruit salad Omelet station Carving station  (prime rib and ham) Ice station (crab legs and shrimp cocktail) Dessert station (too many to list)  Our server Tracey was friendly, but not overpowering. Managers used earpieces to talk to the kitchen to tell them what to bring out to the buffet. They were hands on and that was nice to see. Plenty of TVs for us to watch the different games. And all of this was for the low low price of 19.95 per person! I was sold!",

We ordered the blackened fish tacos with sweet potato fries, the chicken gyro with rice pilaf, and the Suite 200 with seasoned fries. All of the food except for the gyro and seasoned fries was on the bland side, definitely needed salt. We're picky with our sweet potato fries and we're disappointed with these - soggy and bland. The gyro was really good and priced well. It seems like your typical bar food - we'll be back for trivia night!",

The waitress came to our table several times to check up on us ask us how the food was and also get a drink and food order.  The waitress appeared very patient. At the time that we dined at this location it wasn't too crowded there were several families and single individuals at the bar having a drink. Food and drinks came out promptly the place was pretty clean. The waitress brought the drink out and I asked for straw she brought the straw out with her hands and place it on the table. She didn't use a napkin for the straw place it on a napkin. The thing was she didn't wash her hands because she just cleaned off the table with some chemicals then brought someone cash at no point did she wash her hands and placed the unwrapped straw on the table. Yes, I can be over the top but this was just nasty. They had to loose a star for that. I brought this to her attention in a polite way. The person I was with started vigorously praying over the food In fear they would contaminate it because I voiced that I didn't like how they handled the straw before the food came out. This isn't a 5 star restaurant by all means, but your day to day dinning place. It's a decent place for drinks or bar bites, but I do sweat the small stuff. Despite the single incident within the dinning experience....I think it's an alright spot.",

    "text": "Smdh. I've heard so many wonderful things about Dilworth Neighborhood Grille, and in one night...that all went out the window. The service was more devastating than when I was dumped in the 3rd grade by Amy Myers. Some of the worst service I have ever had, and I've had bad. I'm still shocked from the events that occurred that night.  To start out the night, we had a fairly large party as it was a buddy of mine's birthday.  We of course start ordering some beers...which, I will hand to DNG, you can order in pairs.  It wasn't long after that the birthday dinner turned south... Everyone in the group was enjoying themselves, having a good time, when a gentlemen in our party started having trouble with his brew. He literally pulled a shard of glass out of his month from his pint glass! I swear on the Tom Brady's baby blue eyes, that's the truth. He surprisingly didn't make a big deal out of it, but WTF, that's scary to think he could have swallowed that.  The server said \"sorry\" in the most unremorseful way.   Then the food came out...well everyone's but mine and another person's order.  Simply put, we sat there empty handed and felt like the ugly, red-headed step child, forgotten and alone. Since we ordered in two different waves, we hadn't realize the amount of time that had elapsed. I finally went up to the server and asked what the problem was, and the look on his face said it all. He forgot to place the orders... I said to cancel the order since we were leaving and I didn't even receive a \"I'm sorry\". That was the straw that broke the camel's back, no pun intended... as it did happen to be Hump Day. I was hungry and you didn't feed me DGH- and you didn't even offer a simple \"sorry\". Sad! I have no idea what the food taste like here. Actually, I had a couple nacho chips and they were alright. But no main course!  In conclusion, no reason to go there unless you want to sit on their cool patio and watch a sports game. Don't know what the food tastes like but if it's anything like the service, it must be awful. That's speculative. Thanks for nothing Dilworth Neighborhood Grille.",

All of this was ~$32 and we have a full meal just in left overs. Really impressed with the pricing and the food quality. It did take a while though, despite being mostly empty, so glad we weren't in a hurry. By the time I got the ranch that was left off of my tacos I was full and just took it to go. Paying with a Groupon is tricky... A manager has to see you to edit the ticket, a process that took a full 15 minutes. It made it seem as if they don't trust any other staff to support with that and leave it to the sole manager of a huge restaurant.  Definitely recommend if you're in the area and got some time. Looks like they have fun events throughout the week too!",

We ordered the steak nachos to start and they were alright. What was great was they gave us huge portions and the nachos can definitely be shared. I got the buffalo chicken wrap with fries. I did not care for the wrap. It was done poorly and I did not care for the giant curds/chunks of blue cheese. I did like the fries though.   This is definitely a game day spot if nothing else. There were many fans for all different teams supporting their players. There seemed like there were many beers on tap and available so if you're wanting to go watch a game then it's great however the food was pretty so so",

Today we had one of my worst experiences in a restaurant. 1) the waitress did not know, or find out the rotating drafts. 2) today the signs all said $3 craft beer. So I walked into the bar, saw ballast pointe on tap, and we ordered that. 3) my mother ordered soup. It came out cold. She had to ask twice before they could get a manager to allow them to heat it up. Then they forgot to return it. It came after we had all finished eating. 4) I was billed $7 for the ballast pointe beer. When I asked about the craft beer special the waitress said it didn't ring up as a special. She asked if I wanted to talk to the manager. I said yes. The manager wouldn't come, but had the waitress tell us it is an expensive beer.(which might be why I ordered it on special). See attached photos. I brought 8 people here expressly because $3 beer is allot cheaper that $7 beer. 5) and to top it off the charges for the cold soup that took forever to reheat.",

I loved the spice in the shrimp and grits but it could have used some salt and pepper..other basic seasonings but, the mild heat was there. Grits were creamy and there was an ok amount of shrimp. Had to take the rest home. I found the chicken spiedie really dry, the chicken has good seasoning so sauce of some sort would go a long way here. The service was a little slow but, it was also about 9:30 and nobody else was ordering food.   Wednesday nights are half off martinis. I got the white gummy bear, the bartender made it pretty stiff so it was well worth the price. We have also ordered the bread pudding for takeout, so yummy! I love the caramel sauce. Will be back for more!",

    "text": "We headed over to Dillworth for a Sunday night dinner this week.  The restaurant is under going a remodel, but there were no troubles in getting a table. Seems like they want to go for a more upscale feel than simply being a neighborhood grill, and that's cool. Private parties are where the bucks are anyway.   We knew the place had never had decent sweet tea the previous three times we had been there over the last few years and that hasn't changed.  To the owners: Guys, you are in the south now and everybody isn't going to drink beer or other beverages, though I realize we are in the minority here on that one.  Tea that tastes like a mix with sugar thrown in is just gross.  We both opted for some other beverage and my Doctor Pepper was flat.  Sadly, the guy that seated us that looked like he might be the manger refilled my glass once and he didn't notice the lack of fizz, either.  I have drank flat soft drinks before so it wasn't a deal breaker.  My fiance's Delmonico Steak Sandwich was incredibly fatty and messy.  His homemade chips were alright, according to him. He took the steak out of the bun and cut the fat out just so he could eat it.  I opted for the Chicken Spiedie Wrap and was a lot happier with my meal.  I wouldn't want the spiedie sauce every day, but the way they marinated the chicken in the sauce and whatever makes it taste like something other than just Italian dressing was a nice change from what you  might encounter at other places.  The previous times we have been were during the week and there were special items available for that day. We had always been pleased with those.  I don't think we will be going back on the weekend, and I don't think we will be increasing the frequency of our trips to DNG, either. I give them 3 stars simply because in the past the food was always really good for both of us, but this experience was really sub par. I hope this was just a weird quirk that wouldn't happen again if we went back next week.  My bottom line is that it is a laid back place, comfortable and a perfect place to hang out with some friends and cold drinks on the patio or in the bar. If you are a supporter of one of the football teams that they used to be the base for - they didn't have the flags hanging up when you made your way downstairs, so I don't know if that has changed- you'll love being there on Saturdays.  I might give their Sunday brunch a try down the road sometime, but I don't find DNG to be so spectacular that it warrants a drive down from University just to eat there.  I would, however, recommend trying the Chicken Spiedie Wrap just once since you aren't going to find anything like that anywhere in town.",

So I ordered the shrimp tacos ( recommended by the waiter)and a strawberry sweet tea right before kickoff.  The drink came quickly and was the perfect combination of sweet, strong, and refreshing.  However I had to wait until halfway through the 3rd quarter for the tacos to arrive. I opened the aluminum foil to take a bite of the taco and it was a steak taco. Fearful that if I requested a change, the tacos would come well after the game was over, I took a bite of the steak taco. It was flavorful but had way to much gristle. It made it chewy and difficult to enjoy.  Return for the drinks, not the food.",

The build your own salad is reasonably priced, can obviously be tailored to your preferences, and is a large portion.  I typically eat outside on their patio which is basic and not the cleanest. My fiance is not a big fan of this place as he's not a salad as meal kind of guy, so I typically come here with female friends.   The outdoor bar could be a decent place to hang out (they have fans).

The appetizers were unimpressive and the pizza's cheese tasted like cardboard and we didn't take home leftovers (half of the pizza).

Friend and I gave it a try on a Saturday afternoon and there was only one other table dining in the restaurant. Waited over ten minutes for someone to take our drink orders.  Then waited a half hour for our food to come. Ridiculous considering there were only two tables dining in at the time. Lots of waitresses standing around not doing anything.  Our waitress would disappear and it took a long time to get drink refills or order another beer.  Their menu made it sound like they were the only place in town that had spiedies on the menu so I wanted to learn more about it before I ordered it.  I asked the waitress what it was like and her exact words were, \"chicken with some spices. I don't know how else to describe it.\" I went against my judgement and ordered the chicken spiedie that came on a hoagie roll. I will say this, the chicken was very moist however, it did not taste good at all. The sandwich was just a hoagie roll with cubed marinated chicken on top. I'll post a picture so you can see what I'm talking about. Overall it was a very disappointing experience. I'm not sure if I will even be back to watch the Panthers next football season since the service and food was so bad this visit.",

Now we are in the midst of wedding fitness but this was a cheat day, so we started with beers. They were alright. They would've been better if the glass was frosted or just served at a cooler temp in general. For meals, my fiance got the wings (he loves them, I think they are just okay) and I got the buffalo chicken sandwich in a wrap. I tried the sweet and spicy sauce and it was okay.

I felt like I was biting into a piece of rubber. The sauce was non existent and I had to pay $1 extra for all flats or drums that I did not receive  (who does that). There was no flavor...like no seasoning, no nothing; just super hard fried wings. They literally looked like the skin of a hairless cat. The quesadilla however was bomb and that's why I'm giving it two stars.",

Norm, Oz, and Chris are an amazing owner/manager team that have hosted a number of charity events for me over the years.  we have utilized their downstairs on a number of occassions to host the Beards BeCAUSE Clean Shaven and Five O'clock Shadow parties.  they have always been extremely accomodating to our needs as we entertained crowds in the 120-180 range.  they always put the staff on that could handle the crowd and still have fun with the patrons.    for the reason, i have recommend Dilworth Neighborhood Grille to others looking to throw charity events on a budget that have been successful.  they are good hearted business people that ensure a good time.",

Its kind of sports bar in the front, restaurant in the back, and more seating downstairs (I was told). The bar area was a bit noisy....but it IS a bar...with lots of TV screens. But it wasn't so noisy that me and my friends couldn't have a conversation, order food and enjoy some cocktails. The food was above average for a bar, and out of 4 girls, we were all more than satisfied with our choices. Service was good. A very happy experience. I can't wait to go back in the spring and sit outside on the patio. Parking was a bit tight, but it is in Dilworth after all..being from a larger city myself, you learn to get creative..ie...park across the street and walk a block..no biggie in my book.",

My group of friends and I have been going there for going on two years, mostly on Wednesday nights for the trivia.    The food, overall, is better than your average bar food.  They tend to have a lot of variety in their specials and they're reasonably priced.  They came out with an updated menu about 8 or 9 months ago, and to my dismay, the nachos were taken off.  I still occasionally talk the waiter/waitress into getting me chips and queso with jalapenos, chicken and salsa on the side, but it's just not the same.  Would highly recommend the make your own salad or pizza.  It seems like there is a high-level of turnover in the wait staff there.  Not sure if that's a function of it being a Wednesday night and no one wants to work during trivia, but it could be.  Overall, it's a good place to go, but I'm doubtful that it stays a regular place on my rotation because they recently changed the guy doing trivia, and that's part of the only reason we go.",

It generally seems to be a pretty popular place, especially on game days, and there is plenty of room both upstairs and down.   The food is pretty average for a bar, but they do have one item that is truly unique: the Buffalo Tender Dogs. Buffalo chicken fingers on a hot dog bun, with cheese. Me likey.   I've never been here during lunch or breakfast times, but the menu seems to have plenty of items for any meal.  Prices are decent, about what you would expect, which means you can get out for fairly cheap.  The service, both at the bar and at the table, has been good the times I have visited. There are a few tables outside as well for those nice nights when you want to escape the smoke inside.  Nothing special, but a decent place to spend the evening.",

    "text": "OK, so I had to add in the Sports Bar category to this restaurant, mainly because every time I've been there has been for a big game. So while this place may be a nice lunch or dinner spot, the \"sports bar\" aspect is pretty good for watching a game.  Having two levels, there is a lot of seating but still tough to get a table unless you get there early for the game. Downstairs, they bring out the projector to broadcast & turn on the audio over the speaker systems. If you are able to get a seat downstairs, then this place is great, but if you get there late & are stuck in a horrible viewing arrangement, then you won't enjoy your visit. And if you're a Tar Heel fan, then you'll appreciate that both Carolina - Dook games I've watched here, the Heels have stomped. Count me in as superstitious.  I've only picked at some finger foods my friends have ordered here, so I can't really comment on the menu. But from my limited tasting & looking, the food seems quite tasty & filling.  For me, Dilworth Neighborhood Grille is a place my friends & I can go outside of the hustle & bustle of downtown to catch a big game (preferably the Tar Heels). If you're looking to join in with a bunch of other Heels fans, then head over here for the next big bball game, but just remember to get there early.",

The space is attractive and has a lot of seating, with a large bar area and lots of TVs for superior sports watching. Service was also pleasant and prompt. Unfortunately the food we tried (other than the house salad, which was fresh and good) was nothing special. The slaw on the BBQ platter was not very flavorful and the BBQ itself didn't have any kind of smoky appeal. The mac & cheese was OK but not great. As for the shrimp and grits, to me it was way too cheesy/greasy- some may like all the cheese but definitely too rich for my taste and not enough distinct grits flavor separate from the sauce/cheese. This would be a fun place to watch a game and definitely good for the drinking set. Of course I only tried a few items from the menu, but from what I tasted the food is not the draw here.",

We read that they had trivia, so we came pretty much for the trivia, which is on Wednesday nights at 8:30pm. The trivia was pretty good too...topics such as 90's song lyrics, movie lines, college mascot nicknames, etc. The winner for each round got a pitcher of beer and the winning team for the overall trivia got gift cards. We won the round for college mascot nickanmes, but we had already had a lot to drink and had to work in the morning, so we ended up giving the pitcher to another group. The drink special that night was $2 dollars on domestics. They also have a pretty good menu. We tried a 12' Build Your Own Pizza, which was absolutely delicious. The prices were dirt cheap....total tab was under 20 bucks. They had a downstairs that was non-smoking (which is great), but unforturnately, the trivia was held upstairs in the smoking area....I sure can't wait til January when smoking in bars and restuarants will be no longer.

My husband and I decided that we wanted wings last night, and being home with a newborn limits us to takeout/ubereats/delivery/etc. we decided to go with Dilworth because it's close, and has always been a good spot to grab bar food. Prior to ordering, I called to see if we could get the wing flavors split, and the woman said, no problem, you can do two flavors. I also asked if their wings were grilled or fried, if you got them tossed in sagar, and she informed me that any of their wing styles can be grilled. So, we went online and ordered away.   Fast forward to getting the food and opening it at home, we were shocked to see that our wings were only one flavor - not either of the flavors we ordered, and there were only 10. I went back online to make sure I didn't order wrong, but their menu clearly says \"12 wings\". So not only were we two wings short, but they were not the flavor we ordered either. I tried calling back, but no one answered, and well, life with a newborn, I got busy.   Overall, the wings weren't that great (pretty small) and not worth the price, considering you'll only get 10 of your 12.",

We ordered our beverages and looked through the menu. Our waitress kept disappearing and was not available when we needed refills or wanted to order another round of drinks. We ordered our food and it took absolutely forever until it came, possibly close to 25 -30 minute mark.   The chicken tenders and chips were very good. The chicken tenders were large and the breading was just how I like it - not very thick.  Really enjoyed their honey mustard dipping sauce.   Sadly, the poor service overshadowed the good food.   Parking during this visit wasn't an issue due to the time of our visit.  However, their parking lot is small and the spots are tight.",

Great spot for a game night or a good spot to pre game. Parking is always scarce but they just opened up more parking across the street. The bathrooms tend to be a little messy but it's a bar so it's not a huge deal. You could get away with bringing your family on a weekday but under no circumstances would I advice a date night stop... unless you're married and date nights tend to be more on the ultra grunge side.

Especially considering how much money I've spent on this restaurant in the last year. I recently bought wings from Dilworth through DoorDash (recently broke my leg and unable to drive). When the wings were received they were VERY over cooked to the point they were not edible. I'm am not writing a review because of the wings, I am writing the review due to the POOR customer service I received when reaching out to Dilworth to rectify the situation. When I reached out they told me that I would have to contact DoorDash about this issue, which made no sense because DoorDash was not the one who provided poor quality food.  But whatever, I reached out to DoorDash because the wings were truly unacceptable. When I spoke to a rep at DoorDash they stated that Dilworth would be responsible for rectifying the situation (which mAkes sense).  When I reached back out to Dilworth they refused to rectify the situation. No empathy, wouldn't even offer to make a new batch. I would have been more then happy to find a ride, return the poor quality wings to get a new batch. At this point it's simply the principle. I would never treat a customer like that. Especially a customer who literally orders from there atleast once a week. Smh. Dilworth, you need to work on your customer service. This was not a hard issue to rectify, you juSt chose not too.",

I'm not sure why they are so darn good but it's a combo of size, flavor, bite through, and well they just aren't super greasy. We were able to order two flavors and both were a win. Hot and fast these wing need are crying out for a beer.   We also had the nachos (super healthy lunch). The cheese was hot and melty and the steak was tender. The cheese sauce was mixed throughout with only a few bare chips but there was cheese elsewhere for dipping. The improvement here would be the size of the steak, they are more like a steak bite than a nacho topping. The chips held up through most of the process, as you reach the bottom naturally they are a bit soggy as expected.   This place also has a very nice area in the basement for events that shouldn't be missed as parties are planned.",

Dilworth's menu has a lot of choices that are right up my alley but I had to try the  spiedies to see what all of the fuss was about. The food took a little long to come out, but that tends to be the case with larger parties so I can't be mad; it was tolerable. I got the grilled chicken spiedies on a hoagie roll and some added cheddar (because cheese).  For a side I opted for the mac and cheese (again, because cheese). What a solid choice. While I didn't find the chicken spiedies taste to be a unique one, it was a very tender, moist, and flavor-packed sandwich, with the chicken being the star of the show. The cheese I added was good but definitely not necessary. I see why it's served with just chicken and bread. It's because they can, lol. The bread was toasted with a nice crunch and buttery. I'm getting hungry all over again. The side of Mac and cheese was ok too. Not on the level of the spiedies but also not disappointing. I'd get both again without hesitating. Next time I'll be back for the buffalo chicken spiedies pizza. See you next time Dilworth's.",

    "text": "Dilworth Neighborhood Grille is your basic neighbood bar and grill -- hey, it's in the name!  You walk in and the bar area is upstairs, next to a long staircase leading you downstairs to a lot more seating.  It has a very clean feeling to it; nothing dirty or grungy here.  You can feel very comfortable eating here.    I've eaten here once for breakfast and countless times for dinner.  The breakfast buffet was so-so.  It was your basic scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, etc.  Nothing stood out, so I haven't been back for breakfast since.  However, for dinner (and lunches, too, but I can never make it at that time!), I was pleased to see their extensive menu.  At first glance, my eye was immediately drawn to the Chicken Spiedie Wrap and Chicken Spiedie Pizza Pie.  Why?  I hadn't heard the name Spiedie since I lived in upstate New York.  Sure enough, on the menu it reads, \"Spiedies are an upstate New York Tradition.\"  The Spiedie sauce is basically vinegar with spices (and sold at Harris Teeter -- plug, plug!), but it's oh-so-good when you marinate chicken in it.  And it's even better when someone does it for you.  From the first moment I tried the Spiedie options at Dilworth Neighborhood Grille, I was hooked.  They are definitely worth going to DNG for and are offered at such a great value for dinner.    The service at DNG has always been spectacular, too, whether I'm upstairs at the bar or downstairs at a table.  Best of all, one of the owners has usually been there when I've been, greets me, welcomes me back, and always checks up on us to make sure everything with our meals is good.  THAT'S service with a smile.",

    "text": "This review is based off of a lunch experience only.  Meh, I've experienced better says it all.  The service was good.  The server/bartender was very friendly.  The problem was with the meal itself.    I got the crab cake sandwich with pasta salad.  I chose the crab cakes because the menu said that the crab cakes are their best appetizer.  However, I found I could not distinguish that it was actually crab meat.  The color was dark brown through out.  It appeared more like barbecue than crab meat.  I was expecting more whiteness on the inside.  On top of the bad sandwich, it was pricey.  Once I added a sweet tea and the tip, I walked away with a $15 lunch tab!  Not enough food or quality for that amount.  In general, I don't know why more places do not have a better lunch menu.  DNG's  lunch menu appears to be the same as their dinner menu.  There were no lunch time specials.",

TVs everywhere so I can see it being a great place to catch college or pro football and watch several games at once.  Also, its very dude heavy.  I was with my fiancee but she was one of maybe three or four girls there with the rest of the crowd being men.  Might be one of those places the guys go to hang and drink or caught em on an off night but definitely lacking on the female patrons.",

I ordered the black bean burger with sweet potato fries on the side. To my dismay, the burger had a black bean patty with just chopped lettuce and a slice of tomato. I patiently waited for my server to revisit my table, and showed him the burger and the actual fancy description on the menu. The cheese and onion, green onion as per the menu were missing. The sweet potato fries were a mixed bag, half cooked, but it was fun playing the guessing game - cooked v not cooked. Well, I thought the server would fix my sandwich, but 2 mins later, he walked in with some grated cheese and an onion ring, please see the picture attached herewith. I still tipped him, but again, I wasn't so lucky. Note to manager: need to train your staff better, mistakes happen, but don't screw up the opportunity to fix it.",

There is a good variety of bands and fun events happening through the year.   I have also been a part of large group events held down in the lower part of the restaurant and experience the same awesome food and service.

There was a group of us. I had the Buffalo chicken sandwich and my husband had the Carne asada tacos. We also had the caprese salad and shared a basket of chicken fingers. Wasn't bad, but wasn't good.   Service: If ratings were based on service this place would not receive any stars. I have been here a few times and service has always been horrible. They are slow, forget things and not bring things. A friend ordered a sandwich and after all of us got our food we asked about the sandwich and she said she forgot to put it in.  Waited 30 minutes and had to ask multiple times for a side of Ranch for my sandwich. Asked for water refills and they never came. Have to ask multiple times for the same item. Everyone is nice and apologetic, but it's ridiculous.    Value: While this place is not expensive, what you get for what they charge varies. I felt my sandwich was fine, but my husband recieved two Carne Asada tacos for  about $9.00. These were no bigger than tacos you get at taco bell.   Overall, we would never come back, but the comedy troupe we follow performs here. But that is the ONLY reason we would return. We will be eating dinner elsewhere from now on before we go.",

My favorites include wing and chicken quesadillas - the quesadillas are so good honestly  the best that I've had-stuffed so well and have such good flavor(mildly spicy) filled oozing with good cheese but not soggy- rather the perfect amount of toasting. The sweet potato Fries are good too. A lot of beers. Female bartenders are friendly enough. Male bartenders- eh. Nice to relax there",

Many alumni groups use this as their gathering place on game days including the University of Tennessee. I am a huge fan of the Chicken Spedie Pie (pizza) and the Black Bean Burger. They also have a delicious pizza fritters dessert and pretty good wings. The new patio is amazing and will make this an even better place to gather and watch game. While thei parking lot is not huge, there are several areas nearby to park. I wish they were a little more clear and comforting on their website though on where you might and might not get towed. The only reason this isn't a 5-star for me is that the service is pretty spotty. Most of the time it's okay but I've been a few times where it has been downright awful including twice where they forgot to put my order in during game.",

Dilworth has always been a favorite happy hour spot for my coworkers because it is close to Uptown and has parking.   When I lived in Dilworth, Dilworth Neighborhood Grille was basically an extension of my house because it's convenient, fast, affordable, open late, and has some delicious pub grub.  Service is typically on the slow side, so don't go in a hurry. The only other negative is that their beer list is, in my humble opinion, lacking. They have a surprisingly small list of local beers on tap, which is kind of a bummer!",

Although I really enjoyed my bar experience, this review is about the food.  I remember the food being better than this.  They used to serve brunch here and they were amazing. I don't think they do that anymore.  Today I had a Blackened Tuna wrap which was listed as a \"Dilworth Favorite\" and fries.  Let me say this...The fries were the absolute worst I've ever tasted, even worse than some fast food places.  There was no flavor and not even 2lbs of salt and being smothered in ketchup could save them.  And on the tuna wrap, the only flavor I got was from the sauce.  There wasn't much blackened flavor at all.  What saved this from being a one-star review is that even though the bar was busy, the bartenders were very friendly and helpful, especially Kelsey.    Sorry DNG, I really thought your food was better.",

    "text": "I want to like this place. It has such a prime location (walkable from my house) that it will always do well especially during football season. But, the service here is atrocious. I waited until my third trip to give a review. The place was 30% full and it still took 15 minutes before we even had someone ask for our drinks. We ordered apps, beers, and waters right away just because we knew the service was slow. We got the beers 10 minutes later, waters nowhere to be seen(we eventually walked to the bar to get them ourselves) and the food took 30 minutes to come out (wings and bruschetta). I won't comment on the food because it was passable. But again, when the food came out we didn't get plates. Okay, whatever. The waiter kept passing by, never once asked how it was, do we want another drink, etc... I'm seriously not one to complain but fuck, ask if we want to spend money on a drink. Jesus.  Then, getting a check was impossible. Again, we grabbed another waiter to get that for us. I took pictures of the staff (stripped sleeves on shirt) because they all sat eating and drinking with other people instead of working. Even if they were off, take your work shirt off.   Bottom line, this place will do fine because of location. The service is fucking miserable.",
