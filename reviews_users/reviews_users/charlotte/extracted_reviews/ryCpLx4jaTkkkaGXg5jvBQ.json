    "text": "I have to say; if you don't like the food here, you really do not know Chinese food; and having LIVED in China for several months, i feel i can say that on good authority.  The place is not much to look at, and the service isn't exactly great; but its not bad service either. They focus on making GOOD food.   The food is fairly traditional Chinese--nothing too exotic, but unlike many other restaurants in Charlotte the food is cooked in traditional Chinese Style-- not the overly Americanized stuff many other places serve.  The portions are great for the price you pay, and the entrees are always good--i particularly the Hot and Spicy Beef, as well as the Honey Chicken,the Crab Rangoon's (which actually have bits of crab, and REALLY GOOD cream cheese)  and especially  the Kung Pao chicken--cooked almost exactly like it is in China--The food is also ALWAYS piping hot too.  The Chinese are big on veggies, and all their dishes will have plenty in addition to large amounts of meat. Not sure what the other reviewer was talking about shrimp wise; i have always gotten plenty.  This being said, i have NOT tried them for delivery, only take out. And DO NOT get their Fried Rice (hence only 4 stars); it is not good--but the white rice is great.  All in all  its a good Chinese Restaurant serving, solid tasty food.  Don't let one person's bad experience ruin the opportunity for some GOOD food. You've got to be pretty superfical  as well to judge a place by its location and \"spelling\"? It helps to not that the owners AND Cooks here are ACTUALLY CHINESE.",

It was sooo bad, I actually looked into their Health score records which are a great explanation of why the food is so disgustingly, peatree dish bad. I ordered the chicken wings and shrimp fried rice combo, fried scallops, can of pepsi, and an egg roll.  The best part of the meal was the can of pepsi.  You could tell the rice was old because it was hard, & bland.  The fried scallops were freezer burned, just like the poorly battered chicken wings.  It was so bad that I called them and ask what their score was and it was a low 90's. I am mortified that this place is still open.",

I kept the receipt and about two weeks later $300 was taking out of my account from an ATM located 21 miles away from where I live. My bank informed me that there were six attempts to withdraw money at one time and then the person figured out my PIN number. Be cautious when giving this place of business any bank information!!!!!",

    "text": "Disappointing!........I've ordered from this place for years, could always count on my favorites. But, since I've been traveling for work over the past few years, there has been long periods of time that I haven't been able to order my favorite Chinese dishes. So, here we are back from a 4-5 month assignment and I decide to have two of my favorite dishes, Sa-Cha Shrimp and LoMein noodles, I placed an order online and low and behold what a disappointment first, the SaCha Shrimp now has these big chunks of Fried potatoes, though potatoes are not mentioned anywhere on the online menu. Then the LoMein noodles were soggy, but these weren't the typical lomein noodles they usually use, these were like Ramen noodles. Like Duuhhhh, I've had a ton of Lomein noodles in my lifetime, I've even purchased them from the store, I KNOW the difference between Ramen noodles and Lomein noodles. I called the restaurant to find out why there were potatoes in my Sa Cha dish, the response I received was well, we always put potatoes in our Sa Cha Shrimp, NO YOU Don't I responded. Then I pointed out that this must be something new, and that it's not reflected on their online menu as part of the description, after the person looked up  the menu on the computer, she apologized and offered to remake the dish, I decided against it, I didn't want to receive anything peculiar that might make me ill. So, she offered an discount for a future order, and I mentioned the noodle situation and she replied that they were the same noodles they have always used, again I pointedly told her that these were NOT LoMein noodles but Ramen noodles. I will probably now buy a cookbook and learn how to make my favorite dishes at home. I will NEVER order from this restuarant again.  But unfortunately, I guess all goods things must to come to an end.",

    "text": "Like so many I had a menu on my door and finally decided to order. Though it took almost the full hour to deliver it was well worth it. I ordered the lunch orders of curry chicken and broccoli with garlic sauce. Both were delicious. Yes the egg rolls were obviously reheated and were not great but the main dish was hot, well seasoned, and a huge portion for $6. There was a ton of chicken and a good amount of veg in the curry. I also ordered the wonton egg drop soup, my favorite because I don't have to choose between wonton soup or egg drop soup. It had good flavor, the wontons were HUGE. Good consistency, egg drop tends to be gelatinous and this was not. There were no veg in the soup but not all places make it with veg. The Chinese donuts were also good, a little soggy but they were sitting in the box while I ate so that's sort of my fault. Reading the reviews I was nervous but after trying it for myself and not encountering any of the horror stories I would defiantly order from again.",

This is the second time I've ordered from them, the first was just as bad but I'd thought I'd give them another chance since no one else delivers around here. The egg drop soup looks like a cup of oil with some yolk in it and tasted like it too. I've never seen bourbon chicken cooked this way before, I hate to say this but I'm really not sure if it is even real chicken. It was really rubbery like some other form of meat. I think they need a health inspector to come check out their kitchen. Crab Rangoon and chicken wings were really soggy and not crispy at all. I've never wanted to leave a review this bad for anyone but this place is just a real disappointment. DONT DO IT!!!! I should've ordered pizza.",

    "text": "Hello Friends,   Well, if you \"know\" me and check out my profile you will see out of over 130 reviews only 9 are ONE STAR (Eek! Methinks not). Well now its 10. For good reasons.   I do not base my reviews off previous reviews of a company.  I give a lot of places at least 2 or 3 chances to redeem themselves. I love food and try to find the silver lining in all experiences (good & bad)  Well well well..... This place WILL NOT get a second chance.   jankie establishment the flyer/promotion (that they left on my door) spelled the place \"CHeeRY HOUSE\". Really?? and I notice on Yelp and the building its CHERRY HOUSE II... Not \"ChEEry House\".  Lazy owners that don't care enough to get the name of the place right..smh Well, they do offer %10 off on delivery and %15 off pick up over a certain amount. (sorry, i didn't commit to memory since i WONT be back) I know how some are about \"strip mall\" and this is located inside one.. ekk ekk ekk  Now to the \"food\"... Not bad in prices, buttttttt..... you get what you pay for.    My GF had Lemon Chicken (breaded tiny piece of \"chicken\" With a lot of breading to trick you into thinking you got a lot of food) with Crab rangoon (Wasn't bad 3.5/5), & \"brown rice\"  i ordered Shrimp/Chicken & Brocclli & \"Brown rice\" as in white rice with brown sauce on it (and I can tell due to the large lump of white rice in the middle), an Egg Roll that didn't make it to the bag as i guess they forgot even tho it comes in the combo) . I had, and please believe me.. i counted.. 5 shrimp in my whole order. And it wasn't the big shrimp, it was the 20-30 count. The \"spring roll\" was as long as Your middle finger and as wide as 2 fingers. I have a finger for them alright... ah ah ahhhh.. not that finger but my thumb. Pointing at me as to say... I won't be back!",

And the sauce it not bland nor was it lacking as most take out places.  I usually have to order extra brown sauce on the side.  Not here.  The Egg Foo Young is super fluffy.  But that lacks some of the meat/shrimp that's supposed to be in it. The staff is friendly.  And the delivery was in decent time.  Because I know we aren't that close to the restaurant, but they still got to us in good time!  So kudos for that.  The teriyaki chicken on sticks are just chicken breasts on sticks with some red sauce dripped over them.  I was expecting grilled like chicken teriyaki.  So I wasn't a fan of that.  We did order from here again.  And when my husband requests it probably.  But not quite my number one.",

    "text": "Like Mike S. here I do my best to look for the silver lining in all things.  I just couldn't find it here.  We ordered delivery.  One chicken & rice soup and two General Tso's chicken (one with spring roll, one with regular roll - both with fried rice).  The fried rice was literally just that - fried rice - no egg bits anywhere to be found.  I've had this combo at a number of Chinese restaurants around the country and every time it has egg bits.  Oh well, moving on... the order, like I said was for one spring and one regular egg roll - guess what came?  Two regular egg rolls.  But that's still not why I give this place 1 star.  The egg rolls were on the small side and I could not finish mine - tasted bad - again I usually can tolerate a lot of variation in how my food is done - I NEVER throw away food - that egg roll I spit out.  But that's still not why I give this place 1 star.  Moving on to the chicken part of General Tso's Chicken - small bits of chicken deeply fried in a ton of breading.  Flavor was in the middle.  The menu marked this as a spicy dish.  I couldn't find any bit of spice anywhere in the flavoring.  Almost had a barbeque type flavoring to it - nothing like any GTC I've had in the past at a number of Chinese takeout/delivery places.  Not a good dish at all - again I NEVER throw away food... I threw this away - not even for leftovers!  My wife did the same after about 6 bites.  But that's not why I give this place 1 star.  Now - remember I ordered a chicken & rice soup?  Well, what we got could not be described as a soup.  Think more like chicken & rice casserole.  There was water in there - but it was soaked up by all the rice - which looked very pasta-like... and not like \"rice\".  I'll try to upload a photo so you can get an idea.  Anyway, my wife loves soup - this was not soup.  To add to this, they threw in fried wontons - which every Chinese restaurant does for their soups.  You use them to soak up the water/oil in the soup to \"thicken\" it.  Was this a joke?  I called them up and according to the person that answered the phone \"that is how we make it\".  I asked why give the fried wontons then?  Silence.  She said next time I order just say you want it more \"soup like\".  Let me get this straight - when I ordered \"soup\" I need to specify I want it more \"soup like\"!?  For my dissatisfaction I was offered 10% off the next time I order.  Yeah, there will be no next time.  The soup that isn't soup debacle - this is what truly gives this place one star.  You've been warned. :)",

However, the chicken was old and dry. I called to tell them and they offered to replace it or get a refund for that item. I chose a refund. About 10 minutes later, there is a knock at my door. The guy they sent stood at my door while on a cell phone call with a toothpick in his mouth that came in a minivan and asked for the food back. I gave him the food. I wasn't going to eat it anyway. I don't expect free food, but at least tell me you are coming to pick it up. A few days later, I check my credit card for the refund. They refunded me the price of the combo MINUS about $1.25. I called the restaurant to find out why the price difference in my refund. He says to me 'because you ate egg roll'! Now I am mad and annoyed at this point and tell the guy to refund me the full amount of the combo. It's not the price, it is the principle at this point. I called my credit card company and they 3 way called the restaurant just to get my 1.25 back - which he was still so reluctant to do but eventually said okay. I don't know what they did with that food, but I'm suspecting someone else probably ordered it and got it which is disgusting. If I knew he was coming to pick up the food I would have put sri racha sauce all over it to prevent anyone from having to eat someone else's bad food. You have been warned!",

    "text": "Got delivery.  House fried rice (shrimp, chicken and pork) along with egg drop soup and an egg roll. The delivery was on time. The egg roll was on the small side and rather average. The house fried rice was pretty good, though. It wasn't greasy like you see in so many places. I got a small size that was easily enough for two meals. I would have liked a few more shrimp,  but it was fair enough for the price. The egg drop soup was probably the best I've ever had for Chinese delivery. I was very pleasantly surprised overall. Will definitely be ordering again.  ...ordered again, and was a bit underwhelmed.  Need to stick with the fried rice. Their egg drop seems to be hit or miss. Will still order again, but not expect as much. This is bordering drunk food territory",

The food shows up and the delivery guy gives me the receipt and I sign it. As I hand him my receipt he looks in his bag and says \"uh oh\" lmao. This dude literally said \"shit\" and then said \"I go back down\" .... I'm thinking he forgot the food in his car. So I wait 15 mins.... no food. I call them back and they have no idea what I am talking about. I'm calm at this point cause I get it my girl works in the food industry.. things happen. Once I explain everything they try to make a few call and see what's going on.... they don't call me back in 10 mins so I call them. They figured out the guy gave to food to someone else and went to go get it... I explained to them that I do not want my food that's been given to someone else. Call me crazy but I don't want food that has already been delivered and then taken and brought back to me lol. So they say they will call the boss and he will call me... I never received that call. The same girl calls me back and tries to feed my this bs about how my food was never delivered but still at the restaurant.... she proceeds to ask me if I want me food. I explain I wanted my food 50 mins ago when I legit signed my receipt and your delivery guy left!.... she said she will deliver my food ASAP. I'm telling her again I don't want that cold food or delivered food which ever it was. I wanted my original order either comped or at least throw in some extra rice and soup!.... to my surprise they wouldn't comp my food or give me anything as a apology! Like that's common sense in the industry... if your royally screw someone you freaking Try to make up for YOUR mistakes..... I can hear the receptionist talking to the manager while I'm on hold! Lmao they were talking crap about me because someone doesn't know how to put ppl on hold and I could hear every word..... it's sad cause I'm really a easy going person but when you make a mistake own up too it. I'm sure this places food is pretty good so that's not what this is all about. The delivery service was shit.... that's my problem and then didn't try to help me out when I waited 2 hours to just get a refund..... I ordered 50 dollars worth of food that I never saw.... i can't attest to the quality of food but I can the service. It was complete shit.",

    "text": "I used to order form this restaurant but will not do so anymore. I normally don't order the shrimp fried rice but i decided to just to try something new. Let me say every time I order from this restaurant or any restaurant I tip extremely well. I normally tip 25% or more at restaurants but because my orders placed at Cherry House II amount to roughly $14 - $20 each time I always give the driver 40%. When I ordered the shrimp fried rice there were only 4 shrimp the order. I called the restaurant back a few days later to order again and I explained to the woman  i was dissatisfied with my previous order and had never had a issue with them before. I told her in fact that i loved their restaurant before I explained why i was dissatisfied. She stated we only put 7 shrimp in the shrimp fried rice. I told her how much i had enjoyed the restaurant but honestly i was hoping for a better result. First of all 7 shrimp is not even worth paying for shrimp fried rice and second of all I was never given 7 shrimp. I had never encountered this issue at any other Chinese restaurant. To me this is very cheap and i told her that i would no longer order from them if they are going to mislead their customers like this. She simply said \"alright then\" and that was it. It is very sad that a restaurant which was so good can basically sell a product to their customer with such poor quality. Literally it may only equate to $14 - $20 dollars an but its the principle. Every customer should be treated well. I treat the drivers well and expect the same service in return.",

Just have to say from the start that I was skeptical from the start, but when you want Chinese food now, you get what's close.   General Tso's Chicken- Tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for the last hour and a half. The chicken wasn't high quality and was squishy not crispy. Flavor was just not there.   Dumplings were the best part and I would only give those a 2/5. They tasted ok but it's also pretty difficult to screw up a dumpling. I should have just bought a pack from Trader Joe's.   All in all- wouldn't recommend, unless it's the only Chinese place open.",

The food is fresh, broccoli is crispy and it was over all a great experience. They also give you an approximate wait time if you order from home like we did!

The crab rangoons were rangoons but thats about it. The reason i gave 2 stars instead of one was the hot and sour soup was on point. Best i ever had. Dumplings were ok too.

Had I read my buddy Mike S.'s (Yelp! should implement a way to link people within reviews!  I digress...) review before, I'm certain I would not have ordered from here.  That's what happens when its gets past dinnertime and you forgot to eat because you're working feverishly to meet deadlines.  A bit overpriced, but plenty of food provided.  That said, it's just food, nothing special:  Tangerine Chicken - I guess it's dissimilar from orange chicken bc it's miniature.  No, I'm not talking about tangerines, I'm talking about the chicken.  It was literal scraps of chicken that was breaded (somehow), fried and glazed.  Too much sauce, not enough chicken.  I guess tangerines also have a subtler taste than oranges, perhaps?  Hot and (Not) Sour Soup:  I've had hot and sour soup at a number of places, and this was one of a handful of places that don't use enough corn starch to get the desired viscosity.  May be a preference thing... one thing that is not a preference is that it should be a bit sour using vinegar.  Didn't really taste that part of it.  Enjoyed the fresh vegetables in it, but that was offset some by how much oil floated to the top.  Fried Rice - Just white rice and soysauce cooked for a bit on a pan.  Jumbo Shrimp with Garlic Sauce:  The dish is the saving grace that kept the rating above one star.  I thought it tasted quite good.  Again, the vegetables were money--they looked and tasted fresh.  Shrimp were the average shrimp size, not the small ones--I guess, hence JUMBO.  Good texture as the shrimp didn't have that taste like it's been frozen forever.  I won't be ordering from here again.  Prices need to drop to match quality or quality needs to improve to match price.  In any event, no more random ordering without checking Yelp!  dmo out.",
