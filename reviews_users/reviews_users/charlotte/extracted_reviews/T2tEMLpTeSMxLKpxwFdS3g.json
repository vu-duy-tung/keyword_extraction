The corn salsa is refreshing and I'll add this place on my list of regulars for sure.   The only thing that puzzles me is why there is California Reggae Dub music playing in the background.  Its more like Mexico meets Texas on a tourist Jamaican vacation.  I'm a huge fan of tacos and Reggae/Dancehall but I've never seen them meet this way.  It's interesting.  I'll keep coming as long as the shrimp tacos stay on the menu.",

There was supposed to be an itemized order list--not there. I'll admit that I should have checked the bag before I left, but so should they have. Now D is speaking to a manager. It boils down to I ordered it and she didn't hear it. We're out of an entire meal after paying $30. Walter, the manager, is giving D her tacos for free when she goes back.

    "text": "Lets get right to it; if you name your place after one particular dish, that item needs to really deliver the goods. Yeah, the fish taco is flat out spectacular! Here's why I like this so much ...   When you order any of the tacos, you get 2 tacos and a side. The restaurant has  a very nice policy that allows you to mix and/or match your tacos. So have a fish taco and have a chicken taco or whatever taco on the same plate. I like that. Each taco comes to the table like a nice big overstuffed hoagie that you eat kind of openfaced. Cabo Fish Taco has figured out how to prevent this from turning into a giant sloppy mess as you munch your way through the meal. The tortilla is wonderfully crispy, a little flakey, and pliable at the same time while not being at all greezy. No idea how they do that?? It holds up perfectly during numerous pick-ups. And it tastes great ... delivering a fresh homemade flavor that will make you feel like you are sampling a family-secret-recipe.  We've eaten there for several lunches, so I have had the chance to sample some of the other non-taco dishes. All very good but I'm happily stuck in taco mode. One quick word about the sides ... the server recommended their spicy pasta side dish. It was perfectly very spicy hot and the pasta was perfectly al dente. Really nice execution.  One last thought about why Cabo Fish Taco gets 5 stars is due to the atmosphere of the place. Very nice and friendly, casual relaxed vibe. Terrific service. Very nice bar thing going on, which I haven't sampled but it's front and center stage. You can't miss it and it lends the place a nice relaxing backdrop.  Give this place a shot, I bet you will really like it!",

The advocado pasta was ok. I like spicy, but jalapeno was almost all I could taste. The Noda Jam Session was good. My daughters Mahi Burrito was no bueno. She only took a few bites. We are from Florida and used to eating fresh fish. She said it didn't taste fresh or it was not a good flavor combo.  Our waiter left us sitting for a while with the bill waiting to pay. He was sitting on his phone st the bar. I finally walked the check up to him. Probably won't be back. Wish we had picked somewhere else to eat on our one night in Charlotte.",

We started with the queso which was delicious! My husband had the tuna burrito which he loved and I tried the honey soy glazed salmon tacos which were outstanding!

I had the lemon grilled shrimp taco which had a nice light flavor while the tuna with the honey wasabi dressing was awesome! The tacos had generous portions of shrimp and tuna respectively. You can choose your side and I went with the refried beans - it was a lot spicier than I was anticipating, but it was a pleasant surprise. The only thing about the beans that I didn't like was that it was served a bit cold. Other than that I really enjoyed this place and will be back!",

We were greeted by a couple friendly faces at the door and seated in the seasonally enclosed patio area on a cold winter day.  It was toasty in there so no problems there.  We informed our server we were in a bit of a rush and he was super helpful and took our drink and food order right away.  Before we knew it we had our delicious tacos in front of us.  We each got one of the traditional fish tacos they are known for and then got another variety to try.  I had one that had a jalapeno Creme sauce.  It was really delicious but still didn't top the original fish tacos.  I also had the avocado pasta salad as a side.  Yummy but I left about half of it because the tacos were so filling I couldn't eat any more.  I love the atmosphere here and it seems like a great spot for hanging out at the bar and eating some tasty food!",

Got here 6pm on a Monday and we were seated immediately.  Seems like a cool and chill atmosphere.  They have a full bar as well.   Once seated, they brought us complimentary chips and corn salsa. From their taco portion of the menu, you can order any two tacos which come with your choice of side dish.  I went with the BBQ Mahi and the beer battered shrimp, with a side of baja rice.

The service is usually very prompt and there is typically no problem getting a table during the lunch rush.   I love the salsa, and have tried virtually everything on the menu and have never had a bad meal!  I've also been to Cabo for brunch and dinner. Our brunch experiences have been delightful and, if memory serves me correctly, I had a stellar bloody mary the last time I went there for lunch.  My only beef with Cabo Fish Taco is that they don't take reservations for dinner (or at least they didn't the few times I've called), I sincerely hope they'll reconsider because I would love to add the restaurant to our repertoire of locations to go for birthday celebrations and/or to bring out of town guests but I don't like to wait in line for 45+ minutes for a table.   Cabo Fish Taco serves top notch food, and provides excellent service. I'll continue to eat there regularly and, if I find out they've started accepting reservations, I'll up my rating to five stars!!!",

The food is spot on every time we come here and the wait staff is always on their game and friendly.  We would probably visit more as we live in NoDa, but since it's such a long wait to get in most days, we try to visit during off hours - like 3pm on a Sunday.  I would highly recommend if you want some good Mexican food in a cool area of town.",

    "text": "We visited on a bustling Friday night and have our name to the hostess for a table. We were seated in about the quoted time and were greeted promptly with chips & the house corn salsa with a preliminary drink order taken. We wound up ordering the shrimp & chicken burrito (without shrimp haha) and a taco plate with the white fish and carne asada. Both were fabulous and filling. Many creative menu items and plenty of options for a non-fish lover like myself! Ingredients were fresh, presentation was good and service was good as well. Waited a bit for the bill, but hey it was a Friday night and we ate rather quickly. Fun & quirky ambiance. Reggae tunes on and servers wearing plaid ;) funky, mon!",

    "text": "Was wrestling between a 3 or 4 for Cabo Fish Taco, but I give it a 4 because of the fun factor and that I'll definitely be a returning customer.  The restaurant is on a lively street in the NoDa area, surrounded by other restaurants and bars.  It reminds me of some of the neighborhoods back home in Chicago.  We stopped in around 7 on a Saturday night and there was already a line formed to talk to the hostess.  They informed us that it would be an hour, which wasn't a problem.  We expect waits like that on a Saturday night, plus there are a bunch of bars to go grab a drink or two while you wait.  Also, the wait only ended up being about 30 minutes.      Ambience/Space:  4  A very loud, energetic space with island type music playing.  This is a great place for groups that want to go out, slam some drinks and have a good time.  They also have a small outdoor seating area which is great for nice nights.    Service:  3.5  Hostess was very nice and texted us when our table was ready.  Our waiter was pretty standard, more interested in just taking our order and moving on.  Again, it was packed and he was very busy, so no big deal.    Chips/Salsa:  3  The salsa was a pico that tasted very fresh, but I would've preferred a little more spice.  The chips were pretty run of the mill, nothing special.  Entree:  4  I had the two tacos and a side dish.  I tried the white fish taco and the carne asada tacos.  I really liked both.  They had a lot of flavor, but the thing that sealed it for me were the shells.  I chose the rice & beans side, and unfortunately that fell a little flat for me.  It didn't have much flavor or spice to it.  Next time I'll probably try a different side.     Margarita:  3  To be fair, I only tried their house margarita that comes with Cuervo.  It was pretty good, but next time I'll probably go for a different version.  I think they have something like 16 different margaritas, ranging from cheap ($5), to skinny, to flavored, to premium.  It really is a pretty cool margarita list.",

It had to have been one of the of the best fish dishes I have ever eaten.  The portion was huge- I had to take half of it home along with most of the rice and beans. The service and ambience were awesome.  So why only four stars and not five stars?  I had a microbrew.  A pint cost $6.50- or over half the cost of the main dish.  While it was good, I will stick with Diet Coke next time.  But rest assured, I will return!",

The corn salsa was so bland that I felt the need to add a pinch of salt to each bite to experience some flavor before I gave up on it completely.   My family ordered three different dishes  1. Beer battered fish tacos had way to much batter. We could barley tell there was even fish in it 2. Chicken quesadillas were nothing more than mediocre. Chicken was very dry   3. BBQ Mahi Tacos were decent. The slaw on top was a bit overpowering but overall, it was the best out of the three dishes.   Maybe my expectations of tacos is different being from Texas, but I had heard such good things about this place that I set the bar high in my head. If I were to come back here, it would be for the environment, not so much the food.",

So I went there with another friend, but when we arrived it was a 15 minute wait. I didn't have a problem waiting, but the hostess suggested that we wait at the bar and she will come get us when our table is ready. So my friend and I went up to the bar and was greeted by a rude bartender. My friend and I didn't want to drink, so when we were asked what we wanted, we just said water. The bartender was upset and told us that we would have to order a drink in order to stay at the bar, because \"drinks make me money. that's why I'm here.\" It was at that point that I started to feel unwelcomed, so I felt compelled to order a drink. So once our table was ready and we were seated, yet again we were greeted by a rude waitress. This was our first time there and we were stuck on what to order because the prices were a little too much for ordinary platters. Apparently we took too long to decide what we want because the waitress asked if we could decide what we wanted at the bar so that other people can have the table. I was completely appalled and disgusted. I didn't even get a chance to eat the food because the poor customer service ruined my appetite.",

I've been to NoDa several times and this place is always crowded.... I'm talking 45 min wait or so.... But it's no big deal because they tell you your table is ready via text so we just went across the street to get a drink and an appetizer and problem solved. I wish they did take a few reservations for big parties.  Their food is very very good. The fish tacos are the signature dish and the best part is that you can mix and match the fillings. There's a ton of sides I've had the nopalito salad, the beans, the avocado salad and they are all very good. The beer battered shrimp/fish were my favorite.  I also had a burrito on my other visit and it was also very good. We had queso and some sort of crab dip as an appetizer and they were both good. Their salsa has corn and its super yummy.   The service was good too.... prices are very reasonable and you get giant servings of food so can't complain.",

That being said its worth the wait and the buzzer they give you reaches across the street to the shops if your looking to blow some time.

Besides the drinks, I'm not a fan. The salsa is more corn than anything else. I want salsa. I want options. I can't get any options here. The guacamole is one scoop for almost 10 dollars. That hurts my soul.  Why the hell can't I get a regular taco option? Why does it have to be over the top?  I understand my opinion is not the most promising for Cabo Fish Taco. My friends love it. I have tried more than several occasions to find common ground with these tacos but my heart isn't interested nor my taste buds and my stomach isn't delighted over them either. I'm sorry. If you're searching for anything other than your wonderful authentic taco, this place is what your dreams are made of. That said, if you crave tacos from the streets of Morelia...keep searching, fellow taco lover.  But the environment can be fun with friends and I haven't found a need to complain about the drinks.  Truth be told, I will probably return to Cabo Fish taco because my friends don't know the lie I am living.   So I'll see you around and order a drink with an extra shot of tequila.",

The restaurant was packed and the waitress very attentive throughout our meal. I had the lemon tuna and beer battered fish with a side of the spicy pasta salad. The fish taco has a lot of breading and not as crunchy as I would like. The tuna included seemed quality and big chucks. The waitress recommended the spicy avocado pasta salad, which I found not to be spicy and too much mayo for my liking. Both tacos were stuffed with fish making them difficult to eat without making a mess. The tortilla really shined here as they are homemade and served warm. The chips were a huge bummer as they tasted stale and over cooked. I did enjoy the corn and tomato salsa and chipotle cheese dip, but the chips kept me from really digging in.",

Today i had their mule and it was just what i needed on a hot spring evening. The nachos and the chunky salsa is so flavor filled.  I ordered beer battered shrimp tacos and a BBQ mahi fish taco. With in a few minutes of ordering our food came out and was everything I expected and more. We sat in their new add on and it was so nice and exciting to see they have more space to sit. I enjoy this place every time I come.",

The queso is out of this world! Smoky, creamy, and they serve it in an overflowing bowl - my kind of place!   I had the carne asada tacos with rice and beans. So flavorful and definitely not your average taco. What surprised me most was how good the tortillas were! They were double wrapped with a bit of cheese and freshly made. So yummy.   I also tried the Slim and Jalaritas - so good! The right balance between sweet and sour. I highly recommend this place - it's great for a light lunch or even before a night out - may be my new favorite Charlotte spot!",

Then I had the steak quesadilla. Mountains of cheese with steak medium cooked, huge chunks of onion, oily with sliced peppers. AGAIN, where's the flavors? They incorporate little to no seasonings in their dishes. Idk if other dishes pack good enough flavors but I wasn't impressed enough to come back. OH! And then they had the audacity to say the avocado salad was a customer favorite. I tasted it from my sister. It was trash.",

The decor was fun with sugar skull chicks, paintings, signs, wood floors, etc.  Music was  loud-ish but not so bar-like that you're going deaf yelling in someone's ears.  Plenty of bathrooms, although I was a bit thrown off looking for them as they're up against the wall in the bar area, but there's more at the back on the dining room as well.  There's also patio dining.",

I have to say O.M.G so delicious.   I ordered the blackened mahi mahi tacos with black beans and rice and it was so good. They give you so much fish and you can tell it is fresh. They give you two tacos and they are huge!!   My boyfriend ordered the special of the day which was dredged seabass taco and it was amazing too! It was lightly fried and seasoned so well!  Our server was such a sweetheart and was super attentive. She refilled our drinks without even asking! Also the manager/owner came around too and asked how our food was! (Which is a huge plus for me)  P.S this place isnt a mexican style tacos everything has a california style to it. If i am ever back in town this place will be on top of my list.",

With all due respect, I have no idea how this restaurant got so many 4-5 star reviews. The service is great and fast, but that's all I can say on a positive note.  The fish tacos were on the fishy side - even with all of the heavy seasoning and salt, you can't be fooled. Nothing that we got here was fresh. The \"queso\" was straight up Velveeta with some peppers (probably Rotel, if I had to guess). The \"Mexican slaw\" was the blandest of cole slaw with some pumpkin seeds sprinkled on top. Neither the salsa nor the pico de gallo was fresh - you know this Bc it was cold - straight out of the fridge. Any salsa you get at a legit Mexican restaurant, or just any restaurant in general, are served room temp. In either case, it was bland as hell.  Save your time and money and head next door to Sabor. Everything is fresh and authentic and delicious.",

I had the Tavaru Tuna tacos and thought I'd woken up on the shores of the actual Cabo!!  Tender seared marinated tuna - had to be 8 oz between the two tacos - that melted in my mouth.  I had to eat half the tuna with a freakin fork to get the them into hand food.  (I'm 6'2 230 and can palm a kickball).   Once I got my full on taco bite on - holy s$#t - the shell was like a French pastry shell flattened just to handle the all the protein deliciousness.  So in case we are not clear yet.    Stop what you are doing and sprint - not run, not walk - to this place.  And we haven't even started on the drinks. The Jalarita is their house margarita with fresh rended jalapenos and is very good.  They go from good to ARIBA ARIBA ANDELE when you get the Silver Surfer Margarita (mid shelf tequila Cointreau and fresh made house sour mix) and add the japs.  I could say more but i'm getting another drink now. So....  Adios my beloved pendejos!!  Tip: Sit at the back bar and ask for Rafaella. You'll thank me later.",

When it's nice outside, you can enjoy your meal on the front patio and do some people watching. Cool neighborhood too. I'm sure you'll find plenty of things in the area, but you'll keep coming back for more. Enjoy!",

Smack dab in the middle of NoDa, CFT is worth checking out if only so that you have an excuse to check out the funky neighborhood its nestled in.   But the food and drink are worth it, too. As the name implies, try the fish tacos. My girlfriend's obsessed, and they're prepared the same way they are in Mexico--lightly battered, served with cilantro and all the fixins. Very fresh and very tasty, and not too expensive at all. The other food is standard mexican--nothing too transcendent, but it's all very good, too. I love the drinks here, and they sometimes have margarita specials which are worth checking out.   As for its environment, we love this place. It's small and intimate, so we love a date night here (clearly we're not alone). Definitely a good plan: go check out a gallery opening and eat here before or after. Or grab a romantic cocktail on your way home from some art-buying. Tres classy.",

Five mins. later the waitress came back and said the \"chef\" couldn't take the peppers off my tacos as the special was a \"pre-mix\". Pre-mix?! It's a damn taco, not French bouillabaisse!

    "text": "Cabo has been receiving a lot of mixed review lately. Some say that the food has been over hyped and that the food didn't live up to it. Today I dined At Cabo Fish taco and I must say that most (not all things) were actually really delicious.  I'Ve been to Cabo many many times and for the most part I loved it. Today was no different. We walked in around 5 and was sat quickly. We ordered The Cabo Roll and Blackened Mahi Tacos. We got the signature corn salsa and chips which would have been been nice if they were a little warm. The salsa needed a little salt. Overall I like the jazzed up idea of the corn salsa. There has been dispute about how they don't get the whole non-tomato based salsa idea. Well let me tell you this: most restaurants that offer a salsa that is slightly blended usually arrives via sysco trucks in a jug labeled Pace Picante. Im all for FRESH foods, not a product that is heated and cooled and shipped thousands of miles!  The Cabo roll was filled with cheese and rather large chunks of both crab and shrimp. It was tasty but the guac needed onions, lime juice and instead of rolling the ball in cilantro it should have been mixed in. maybe a little salt too. As always the tacos are always a favorite. My personal fav is the Diablo shrimp, today however we ordered, and loved the blackened mahi mahi. The fish was perfectly cooked not dry or over cooked at all!!!  I absolutely love their sour cream and lime sauce they use on almost everything... nom nom nom.  I know service is kinda wonky but today they were on par.  love Cabo will be back.!",

Because of this, it was not the best service.  However, food was worst.  The salsa (whatever you call that) was not authentic, not good and very bland. The queso was OK! and my fist taco was just bland and not good.  The ingrediants that make Mexican food special are a combination of  citurs (lemon, lime), garlic, cilantro and salt.

    "text": "If you're looking for a casual mexican dinner this is a must-visit restaurant.  It is quite loud and can be tightly packed at peak dinner hours, but worth the experience.  Upon being seated, a bowl of chips and side of tomato-corn salsa will be brought to the table.  The salsa is good and different from the more traditional pureed type, but the chips are nothing special - cold, thick, and relatively tasteless.  I've only ever ordered the tacos here.  It's not stated on the menu, but you can combine any two tacos for the taco plates.  I chose the BBQ mango and Tavaru Wahoo tacos.  The BBQ mango is super saucy and flavorful, and the Tavaru has a stellar honey-wasabi sauce.  All of the entrees are served with a side and I chose the Nopalio salad, which was a cold mix of black beans/cactus/spices.  I've also had the mexi-slaw in previous visits and was pleased with its very light dressing and topping with sunflower seeds.  In addition to great tasting fresh food and generous portions, the prices can't be beat.  $10 will buy you two very large tacos (seriously the most stuffed tacos I've ever had) and a side.  This is definitely not the restaurant where you leave hungry.  Several \"double decker\" cake slices were listed as daily specials, but I was too full to partake.",

The atmosphere was relaxed and pleasant. My girlfriend's Beer Battered Salmon dish left much to be desired. Personally salmon is not a fish that muddle up with deep frying. The flavor was truly lacking. Rachel was our server and definitely contributed to our pleasant dining experience. I would highly recommend this very reasonably priced restaurant to a friend.",

    "text": "If you like Tacos or Latin food in general, then Cabo Fish Taco is the place to go.  The food is simply delicious.  This was not my first time going but it is my first review of the restaurant and it is something you need to see.  Location: It is located in the North Davidson aka NODA part of town on a busy street with both street parking and a small public gravel parking lot ($3 for all day parking).    Restaurant: The interior has very eclectic art everywhere (which I love) and the place has a very fun, funky, chill vibe.  We had a party of 5 this time and we were still seated right away.  The booth was comfortable and spacious.  I used the ladies room and found it to be clean, well lit and well stocked.  They should upgrade the soap from what they are currently using (cheap pink stuff) but they at least had soap in the dispensers.  Service: We had some folks who \"like things just so\" and our server was very patient in getting everything just right.  He was great.  Food: Let's start with the beverages this time as they happened to have Margarita's on special this day so we all tried different variations of them.  All were good but they were kind of light on the alcohol.  For me that was the only negative was having to pay $8 for a drink but wondering why I felt nothing after drinking it.  On a much more positive note we munched on the chips and salsa while we waited for our food and the taste was very good.  Not too spicy but had enough spice to add a bit of a kick.   We ordered tacos with sides and a variety of other things.  The food was succulent and very well seasoned.  The chefs here have spent a good deal of time working this menu because the food is always consistent.  I had the salmon Taco's and they are always finger-licking-good.  Be sure to get one just to try it.  Ballantyne is actually closer to me so I will go and try that location on my next visit and I hope it is as good as the original location.  This one has set the bar high.",

Stopping by on a recent evening, my wife and I started with a pair of delicious (and potent) Silver Surfer Margaritas, along with a complimentary bowl of crisp tortilla chips and fresh salsa.   For my entree, I ordered the restaurant's signature dish: the wonderfully flavorful BBQ Mahi Tacos. Guy Fieri raved about them on his show, and this recommendation was spot-on. My wife enjoyed the Carne Asada Tacos, which weren't quite as delicious, but still an excellent choice.   Cabo has a fun, family-friendly vibe, and the friendly and prompt service was as good as the cocktails and food. While the restaurant doesn't take reservations, you can put your name down using the NoWait app, or just kill time like we did at one of the many neighborhood watering holes within a short walk. NoDa is one of Charlotte's coolest neighborhoods, and no visit is complete without a stop at Cabo Fish Taco. Definitely worth the trip.",

Staff were pleasant and the drinks were good. The food was great. I had the taco option. It's not listed on the menu but you can pick two different flavors. I got the chicken and the beer battered cod. The cod was my favorite. As a side option I got the brand and rice. The black beans come over the rice with a bit of cheese as a topper. I felt the portions were pretty good and filling. If in the area I may come back.",

I recommend getting a margarita. Every time we've been it always looks crowded, but don't let that deter you we've never had to wait for more than a couple of minutes before being seated. It's great for a date night, dinner before going out in NoDa, or for a group. We'll definitely be back!",

My friends had been to a different Cabo Fish Taco and I've always wanted to try it and let me say, it did not disappoint.   I had the Soy Ginger Shrimp Tacos with the Jalapeno Cheddar Mashers and it was absolutely delicious. You get 2 tacos with your order but it's a decent handful and you get a good amount of shrimp. I don't know what they do with their tortillas, seems like they lightly fry them, but it just takes the taste to another level.   My friends who have been to another location even said the food here was exponentially better than what they've had. I definitely recommend this place!",

The complimentary chips and salsa was just ok, there is a lot corn, I mean A LOT!!! I ordered the guacamole for an appetizer, and this was the most disappointing guacamole I've ever had! It was not fresh avocado, it tasted like the wholly guacamole brand, and they put the tomatoes, red onion, and jalapenos on the side, so you have to mix it yourself! It is not seasoned at all, we asked the waiter why isn't it fresh, and he said they are working on making it better! I ordered the salmon tacos for my entree, and it was just ok. My guest ordered the tofu tacos, and it was under seasoned. The atmosphere was nice, and the waiter was super nice, but the star of the show \"the food\" was not impressive! I will probably never revisit!",

And don't forget to ask about thief daily taco special. They usually have some unique options like alligator or shark. Plus, you can mix n match your tacos so come with a group of friends and try them all! Also, something unique, is that Cabo lightly frys their tacos shells, giving them a light, soft, yet crispy texture. Probably one of my favorite taco shells (is that a thing?) in Charlotte.   Now to the sides- you gotta get the avocado pasta salad. It sounds strange, but so delicious. Warning - It's  packed with a little heat, but oh so good!!!!   The margaritas are also pretty solid and they have plenty of options and flavors, including a full bar and a variety of different beers. They usually don't post their specials so be sure to ask your server if there are any!!! I've gotten lucky here before with Dos being the beer of the month.   Now writing this review got me excited to go to Cabo again, as I'm going there tonight!!!! Aye aye!",

At first I was a bit worried bc it's kinda hot today but their patio has a fan and it's just so nice and pleasant. They brought us chips and corn salsa which was good but honestly not my favorite. I prefer regular salsa, just too much corn for me but people seem to love it, so it might just be me haha I ordered the blackened shrimp taco and the calamari taco with a side of fresh fruit. The shrimp taco was amazing, it had a nice kick to it. I would eat it all the time if I could. The calamari taco was also good but it was a tad greasy bc they fry their taco shells. I feel like since the calamari was fried, having the shell also fried was too much.",

Food quality was average for Mexican themed fare. The tacos we had were really nothing special. Facilities are cool, the place has a funky crunchy vibe. The place was packed when we went and service was quite slow. Since the food and service were just average it's my opinion that the food is over priced for the experience you receive. If your looking for Mexican in Charlotte, check out my review of cantina 1511. If you're close by it might be worth a look but it's definitely not worth a special trip.",

When I asked for salsa what I got what tasted like it came out of a jar from the supermarket, so I ordered tomatillo salsa for $5 which tasted like old salsa freshened up with lime juice, which just made it runny.  My white fish tacos had slightly deep fried flour tortillas which just made them greasy, and as bland as everything else so far.  My boyfriend's ginger wasabi burrito didn't taste like ginger or wasabi, he got a hint of wasabi in one bite. Overall everthing was incredibly unremarkable.",

    "text": "We've been back to Cabo Fish Taco several times since my initial review.  We went again this past Sunday afternoon for a late lunch/early dinner.  It was still pretty busy, despite the off time, but thankfully not like a Friday or Saturday night.    The complimentary chips and corn salsa are excellent, but there's hardly enough time to eat them because the entrees come out SO quick.  And that's not a bad thing.  Almost always, I order Honey Wasabi Tuna Burrito (minus the mushrooms) with the tuna cooked rare.  It's always so freakin' delicious with that sweet spicy flavor that I can't stop ordering it.  This time around, though, I decided to be daring.  I ordered the Tavarua (tav-a-roo) Tuna Tacos.  I know -- so off the wall, right?  It's pretty much the tuna burrito minus the rice.  Upon delivery, the tuna was literally spilling out of the taco shells.  That's how much tuna there was.  I picked one chunk up with my fork and ate it.  OMG.  It was incredibly flavorful, juicy, and cooked to perfection.  Since I had never had their tacos before, I was amazed at how delicious they were, too.  The shells were super fresh (I'm assuming handmade/cooked), and they were a little puffy and soft, but with some crunch.  Wow!    A side comes with the entrees, and I usually order the Nopalito Salad.  It's light and refreshing.  Oddly, this time around, there were hardly any nopalitos (prickly pear cactus pads) in it, but the chickpeas and black beans were good.    The service was fantastic, too, and I think I've found my new favorite \"usual\" at Cabo Fish Taco.",

They have an interesting and wide variety of tacos here. Obviously a lot of fish offerings from Mahi Mahi to Tuna and even Swordfish. But beyond that, the carne asada is some of the best you'll eat, and they have an incredible pasta salad that is made with avocado. Be sure not to pass up the queso dip, which is infused with chipotle pepper, and thicker than your average mexican queso dip.",

    "text": "I just moved into the neighborhood and had to try this place out. I'd heard it was the best fish taco joint in town and an all around great restaurant.   My wife and I went for lunch and each got two tacos and a side as per their taco menu. I chose the beer battered white fish tacos with rice and beans and she got the tuna tacos with the avocado pasta salad. You get unlimited chips and salsa when you sit down. The salsa is really good - extra chunky and a little spicy. I was a little surprised at first that the cost was $10-11 for that amount of food, but when the plates came out I understood why. The tacos are HUGE. As in pieces of fish falling out all sides. We munched on several bits with forks before attempting to pick the shell in and go at it like a regular taco. It was manageable from there.   The battered fish tacos were very good. The fish was really soft and tender with a light batter that was very crispy. The sauce was delicious. The tuna tacos were nicely seasoned with a great texture as well. They had a horseradishy flavor from the sauce. The beans and rice were good for what they are and the avocado pasta salad was very good. It was nice and creamy with a delightful avocado flavor.   I will definitely return, but next time I think my with wife and I will split one order as we each took some of our meal home with us and were still full when we left. My one criticism would be that I'd prefer the tacos to be half the size and half the price. It would be an adequate amount of food and only cost a reasonable $5-$6.",

    "text": "Went here for the first time because it was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives television show. It is now my favorite restaurant in Charlotte and the best fish taco I've eaten. Every time I have guests visit Charlotte, this is a place that I take them to. Every time. Each time I've gone here (4 or 5 times) has been a great experience.   The vibe and the ambience is upbeat and laid back. The lighting is fine, and it gives off a casual dining atmosphere. The service is extremely quick, and the waiters have been attentive and friendly every time. They start you off with free chips and corn/tomato salsa which is very tasty. Not to mention it's free!   I've only ever eaten the fish tacos here and I can't imagine myself ordering anything else. They let you mix and match two tacos with each other, so you can try two different ones. The portions are pretty big and they don't hold back when it comes to the fish. Not a big fish taco eater prior to coming here, I always assumed I would be hungry after eating fish tacos. Not here - I am stuffed every time. The two fish tacos come with a side dish ranging from rice and beans to jalapeno mashed potatoes. One sneaky good side I would recommend is the avocado pasta salad though! Would recommend the BBQ mahi mahi tacos (the ones Guy Fieri had on his show) and the Tavarua tuna tacos (if you're not a big wasabi fan, get the sauce on the side, cause it's strong).  They don't do reservations so expect a wait at peak hours, but it will be worth it.  Bottom line: Amazing food, great atmosphere, efficient and attentive service. What gives this 5 stars and not 4 is the affordability - Prices are extremely fair and you get a lot of good food for what you pay. If you're in Charlotte you must eat here.",

The BBQ tuna taco is a fan favorite and is extremely flavorful if you looking for a twist on a fish taco.  I love most of theirs sides but am still disappointed that the jalapeno mashed potatoes are no longer on their menu.   The wait can be long but if you remember the days prior to their expansion, it's gotten a lot better. Parking in Noda is always difficult so be prepared to walk.",

But I have mixed reviews about this place after I tried their fish tacos and BBQ mahi. Really overpriced for the lack of quality. The tacos were mediocre- fish tacos tasted bland and the batter overpowered the fish inside. The BBQ sauce on the Mahi tasted like it came from a bottle that you can buy from the store and fish was overcooked.  Will prob go back here again only because our server was so pleasant and accommodating. She noticed I didn't like the beer she suggested so she offered me what i originally wanted on the house. They clean the tables right away and try to seat ppl as fast as they can.",

Super flavorful, fresh tortilla was perfectly crispy and they had a good texture from the slaw. Definitely a hipster vibe/setting, portion size was good for the price. I've been back a few times since and I've tried the tempura salmon tacos (daily special) and the crab dip. The crab dip is probably the best thing on the menu, next time I might order that as my meal! Only downside...I wish the chips were a little hotter and I wasn't a huge fan of their corn salsa it was more of a pico but overall great place!",

So one night three of that large group and spouses decided to get together and go.  It was a saturday night in Aug.  The place was packed, there was no place for us to wait, they told us atleast an house wait but to check in 30 mins.  We went across the street to a bar and had a drink while waiting, one person from our party went and checked in after 30 mins, they told us 45 more mins.  We then went to finish our drink they walk around and browse in some stores.  We had to stand across the street and wait, there was no place to sit because there were sooooo many people waiting.  We finally got a table, it was right near the bar, which was packed, and had people's butts sticking in our face during our whole dinner.  The place was so loud we could barely hear the waitress.  For as busy as the place was we had ok service.  They had NO chips, ran out of them.    We ordered the Cabo roll to start, my husband that doesn't usually like crab enjoyed them, as did the whole party.  We all enjoyed out dinners, they were very tastey.  We all said we would go back but never again on a Saturday night and I am sure Friday night is the same way.",

It started when they forgot about us for 45 minutes.  We were wondering why our food was taking so long, when our waitress popped over to tell us that \"the printer hadn't printed\" our order, so we had fallen behind.  I am not sure whether that was the truth or not, but when one of our party (half-jokingly) asked if they were going to adjust our bill, she made some snide little joke about all she could do was keep our water glasses filled.  And guess what--she didn't even do that!  When the food finally came, it was pretty bland, and the portions were very small for the price they charge.  I didn't want to pig out, but I left hungry.   Other small annoyances:  -the hostess who sat us was quite rude, at one point informing us that we needed to move because we were \"in the way.\"  Ok, that's reasonable, but that's not how you talk to a customer.  You ask nicely or at least say excuse me.   -The board listing their specials was a night old, so we tried to order things that weren't available.  The waitress looked at us like we were stupid before we pointed out their mistake. -It's loud.  Almost too loud for a bar, and definitely too loud for a restaurant where, you know, you might want to be able to talk with your companions.  I was very disappointed with Cabo this time around... I don't think I'll be back.",

A big reason was because they serve complimentary house corn salsa with their chips - he LOVES corn salsa.  (Though I think their corn salsa bowl can be much more generous.)    They're tacos are delicious and unique - love their soft taco shells!!! They're fried but still soft and decadent.  Amazing.  I ordered both types of fish taco on the menu, and they were great.  Will definitely order again.  Ambiance/decoration - lively, colorful & fun.  I absolutely love the Day of the Dead paintings - which I could take them down and have them in my own apartment.

Our waiter was too busy falling all over some yuppy girls at the next table to bother with us.  We're generally not picky, but after we brought the problems with the meal to the attention of our waiter, he literally shrugged, apologized and went back to flirting with the next table.  No offer to correct anything.  We won't be back anytime soon.  Overall the place is great for people to see and be seen, it's a yuppy hangout, it's loud and the food is hit or miss.

My side of rice and beans were cold, undercooked, and had no seasoning. The corn salsa was served with cold ships and once again no seasoning.

While I commend you for giving me a lot of food, it simply was not good.  I also have an issue with the corn salsa that come with the chips at the table. I love corn salsa IN a dish. But, it makes for some seriously awkward dipping with just chips.   The kernels...they were...everywhere.",

    "text": "Oh Cabo, I've always meant to visit you! Why didn't I do it sooner? Oh it's probably because you suck. I want to give it the benefit of the doubt, I mean everyone has bad days right? But it's just so bad that I don't want to go back.  So after agreeing to go to Cabo Fish Taco after a pretty bad Eclecfest event at Red at 28th, I was kinda excited. Because Tacos! So after my date and I found some parking, we discovered that we were the first to arrive in our party. I walk in and I'm told by the hostess that there is an hour wait for a 5 person table and a 10 minute wait if we want to squeeze into a 4 person table. I ask to see the 4 person table and it's not really too bad so after some feedback from the others we agree to a 4 person table. Well I went to the restroom, and apparently my friends got told to move it cause they're blocking the hostess's path. Maybe they put up a fight getting out the door who knows, because all I know is after I got out and joined them again to wait outside she yelled my name like she wanted to kill me. My line of work deals with very upset people all the time  so I didn't think too much of it, but my friends and date were quite shocked and upset over it. As we get seated I'm wondering why right next to us there's a perfectly good table for 5 but we're still seated at the table for 4, oh well. Our orders get put in pretty fast I thought after a confusing mix up with them not updating their daily specials board. Chilling with our drinks that don't get refilled, so my date Allen generously refills my cup with his water. About 45 minutes of no water later, when I'm hungry and not happy enough our waitress comes over and says the printer had problems and hadn't printed our orders out (sounds to me like they totally forgot the order). She said sorry I'll keep your water filled at least! Well she didn't even do that. Maybe you could have sent over an appetizer or something after making us wait so long for food and not even checking up on us, because we're hungry!  Finally the food the food arrives at our table, and it's pretty skimpy portions but I'm a positive thinker so I say maybe it'll taste great! Well was I wrong about that. There are way too many onions in the quesadilla, maybe if they had actually stated that there were going to be onions galore in there I would've been able to ask them to omit them. I just wanted a cheese quesadilla guys! We would have been able to share the disappointment in our dishes if the waitress had been around or if we could have heard each other over the loud noise of the place.  So people left hungry, prices are not good for what you get, and there is rude inattentive service there. This place managed to get everything wrong and leave such a bad impression on their customers so why is it so popular? I for one don't have any inclination to return anytime soon, or ever.",

This restaurant is within walking distance of some great small music venues and galleries in NoDa. I was prepared as I watched the Triple D excerpt on their web-page and checked out the menu on-line. We had quick service and plenty of chips and corn/pico type salsa to prevent over ordering. 3 of our party had the Tuna with Wasabi burrito and not a one of them offered me a bite so they must have enjoyed it very much. I went with what they are know for- a blackened Mahi fish taco and a beer battered shrimp taco. both were good, the Mahi was better. I also had the Silver Surfer Margarita, fresh and tasty, no syrupy mixer. I would eat there again if for no other reason than the convenient location and to try something new.",

One thing I did take from the reviews was to stay away from CFT's standard fried fish taco. Instead, I went for the grilled mahi mahi taco, which was very good.  Also tasty was the Mexican slaw with pumpkin seeds that our friendly waitress recommended.   A big thumbs up for the decor, too. CFT is located in an old renovated building with brick walls and old wooden floors that is festively lit and full of warm bright colors. I really thought the design elements of the space added to the experience.   Sure, it is not exactly Ocean Beach San Diego, but it is pretty darn close and a really fun atmosphere with great service. It is definitely worth a visit.",

Very attentive, very professional staff but not stuffy or uptight and quite fun, I always leave happy and full. Many of my friends are now addicted to this place and I must say I am the cause for this addiction. Anyone who has yet to try this place, I have to recomend the Cabo Roll and/or the Honey Wasabi Wahoo Burrito. Both are heavenly!",

A really nice outdoor seating area  Let's start with the staff, the bartender gave me the wrong change ( not just keeping a buck or two for a tip- maybe it was a mistake) and fought with me for about 5 minutes before I had to show him the price of my drink in the menu. I think my waitress hated me or just hated life.  The salsa is corn based- okay, I can get that you want to be different, but the salsa is bland and simply tastes like canned corn. Our chips were stale. The queso would have been okay, but it was cold, which made it form into solid cheese- not very good on stale chips.  I decided to get fish tacos- I figured with a place called ' fish taco' I couldn't go wrong. My shrimp tacos were really boring. It seemed like the kitchen ran out of ingredients  I think they were beer battered, to be honest I couldn't really tell. My whole tables meals came out at different times and our sides to our meals were incorrect.  I would have told my waitress that our food was incorrect, but I couldn't find her for the rest of the night, until our checks came.... $12.00 for two bland and skimpy tacos. No thank you!  I really don't like to give bad reviews, but I can't find a reason to return to Cabo Fish Taco.",

Fish wasn't cooked all the way through. The carne asada meat was tough to chew, like chewing on leather, and lifeless in flavors. Tortillas were hard. Spicy avocado pasta tasted like it was made a week ago and refrigerated. I used to love the chips and salsa here but the chips were stale and the salsa was lacking its usual spice. Our bill was close to $80 for four people... That price does not justify the quality of the food we received. Server hardly returned to see how we were doing. On top of that, she kept change from the cash we handed her for the bill.. Possibly assuming it was her tip?? When should you ever assume though? Had to hunt her down to ask for the change after waiting for her to return for about 10 minutes then she acted like we were being rude or an inconvenience... I've never encountered these types of problems here or had a meal that was this subpar here... Really disappointed. Hopefully next time I decide to return I'll be able to add more stars but it'll definitely be awhile before I come back.",

This is why I am not giving Cabo 4 stars. Along with that, they give you Corn Salsa and personally not my favorite, I would rather have a tomato based salsa. But that is me. Furthermore, you have to buy your GUACAMOLE and GREEN TOMATILLO SALSA for $6.50 and $3.95. The Guac was not great and only a ice cream scoop worth for $6.50. Need to offer free salsa. The good is this is not your average Mexican taco join. They do have burritos as well but did not try any.",

I got a burrito once - nothing to rave about - and the scallops once - tasty - but I'm kind of blown away by the reviews on here who give CBT a one or two-star rating and then confess \"well, I don't like seafood/fish/the central concept\" etc. Why would you go to a place with the word \"fish\" in the name? But anyway....  The corn salsa DOES always end up on the table. Just wipe it up. The real disappointment for me, taste-wise, is the sides. I've had the cucumber salad, the napolitos salad, and th baja rice...all not good at all. My husband always gets the Mexican coleslaw, but I stick to beans/rice (with corn)...definitely the tastiest, in my opinion.  And spending $8 for dinner - excellent. Add in a margarita (starting at $4 for the \"El Cheapo\") and you're all set.",

They brought over chips & salsa. The chips were warm but I didn't get the feeling that they were made fresh. They were on the thicker side. The salsa was a mix of corn and tomatoes/peppers (pico de gallo). Not spicy and not really salsa, but ok. We each ordered our own combo taco plate ($10.50) which came with two tacos and a side. I got one BBQ Mahi taco and one Tavaruva Wahoo taco with fruit as my side (seasonal). I was incredibly underwhelmed with my food. The fish in both were way overcooked and dry. The wahoo taco was way salty and the mahi was under seasoned... Another thing that annoyed me, they only have flour tortillas... Really? A fish taco place with only flour tortillas... Even worse, they weren't homemade/fresh. They had that store bought flour tortilla smell. Come on guys... Step it up.",

I have been there before and noticed servers scooping chips into baskets and letting them sit next to the bar to grab as needed. I understand the urge to save time while serving, but this guarantees that the chips will be stale when they reach the table. Also, because they're sitting out in the open, it increases the chance of contamination from all kinds of things...so no thanks. If you get stale chips - complain. It's the only way to make them change the way they do it. The avocado pasta salad and queso dip are not to be missed!",

I've tried all varieties, Mahi-Mahi, Salmon, Beer battered etc....all are excellent with exception of the beer battered whitefish tacos.  They are bland, but are supposed to be the \"signature tacos.\"  Sides:  Stick with black beans and rice.  They are a safe choice.  Only complaints:  Lack of \"specials.\"  Occasionally they have $1 off margaritas, but their sandwich board of daily deals only ever include \"featured items\" and offer no real price break or discount.

The free corn salsa they give you with chips is delicious and has a little zing to it because of the red onion they mix in imo. I've also had plenty of the cheese dip appetizer over the years and it has a kind of \"smokey\" taste to it that sets it apart from a regular white cheese you would get at a lot of mexican restaurants.   The tacos are all well prepared and my personal favorite is the BBQ Mahi tacos. I probably get that at least 2 out of every 4 trips there. A lot of the other times I will try out whatever the special is they are having. I tried the scallop wrap yesterday and while the scallops themselves tasted a little overdone (I'm guessing its extremely difficult to cook a perfect scallop) it was still a great meal.   The only thing I think they could work on, and this is something I have noticed over the years, is that it seems like a lot of the time they run out of the specials. May just be a testament to the restaurants popularity but if the special is no longer available please take the eraser to the chalkboard so my taste buds don't get all worked up for nothing,",

Yes, there isn't really a good area to sit and wait. But yes, it is worth it. When you're coming to a restaurant this delicious, you'll probably have to wait.  The food: I'm not a huge fan of the chips and salsa, but most people I go with love them. I've had the BBQ Mahi Tacos (about 6 times). They are amazing. The tortillas are fried and the slaw is incredible. I usually get full after the first one, which says a lot because I can usually house my meals, but always make room for the second taco. The sides? Nothing great. Some of my friends love the jalapeno-cheddar mashers. I usually pay the up-charge to get a side salad, which is delicious, but the tacos are good enough that the lack of yummy sides doesn't really matter. The Guacamole Salmon Salad is also incredible.  Great beer selection. Decent margaritas. The prices can't be beaten. I love NoDa and I love Cabo Fish Taco.",

I liked the happening vibe at CFT.     We were headed to Neighborhood Theater for a later show, so we had time to hang out and have a few drinks, chips, and salsa while we waited.  The chips & salsa were so-so, but I was so hungry we devoured a whole basket!  I personally like a spicier, more  tomato-ey salsa, but that's just me.  My battered shrimp taco was OUTSTANDING!  I loved the flavor of the shrimp and the tortilla was delicious.  My chicken taco was good too, but I could have devoured more than one of those shrimp puppies.  The barbecue mahi was pretty darn delicious too.  NoDa is a cool neighborhood...we'd definitely come back for more tacos and another show!",

There's no other way to put it. You can be at a 2 person table and not hear a single word your date it saying. I can't even imagine what  a 6 person table is like.  Service was fast and very friendly. I have no idea how our server even heard me over the roaring but our orders came out fresh and correct.  The food's a 4, maybe a 4.25, but the experience is a 2 at best. I don't go to a restaurant to sit in silence because conversation is totally futile.

    "text": "My wife and I stopped here today after hearing good things about the place.   We were disappointed.  Although the service was fast and our waitress was very nice, the food was mediocre.  Firstly, the guacamole was obviously out of a container.  We suspected that they use the exact same pre-made brand that you find in the grocery store.    They tossed some fresh chopped onions and some other stuff on top, but they weren't fooling anyone.  (By the way, the charged more than 6 bucks for the stuff.)  Secondly, the chips they served were stale and under-salted.  Thirdly, the refried beans were also out of a can.   They had the EXACT taste and texture of the Old El Paso brand refried beans that you can pick up in any grocery store for $0.99 a can.   Of course, Cabo will charge you considerably more.  Finally, we have to talk about the fish tacos.   We tried 4 varieties of their tacos, and they were all bland and uninspired.   The fish was overcooked, the sauces were just gross.  They used fried flour shells and cheddar instead of traditional corn tortillas and cojita or queso fresco (which would be the more authentic way to go with this sort of fair).  Personally I didn't mind the flour shells, but my wife thought it was blasphemy.  Lastly, a word to the chef:   Wasabi and Mustard are not the same thing.  -- The honey-wasabi sauce tasted exactly like the spicy mustard you get from a chinese restaurant (which is generally just ground mustard mixed with water).  I could be wrong- maybe the other flavors screwed up my taste buds- but that tasted just like any generic honey mustard sauce.  I don't mean to bash these guys too much.   The meal wasn't awful- it was just awful for the price.  Also, I need to knock down their rating a little bit, because they just don't deserve their current 3.5 stars on Yelp.  My wife wants you to know that you can get better food at Chipotle.",

So I finally went today.  Got there around 6:30 pm on a Friday evening and the tables were filling up quickly.  Cute decor, island music and nice youthful ambience.  I was feeling good...but not for long.   Chips and pico were served. Took a quick glance at the menu and knew what I wanted.  Fish tacos!  What else?  The place bears the name so it must be their specialty, right?  Wrong!!  I ordered the blackened mahi fish tacos.  ($10.50 for 2 tacos +1 side).  They were wrong in all senses of the word.  Where do I even begin...  Ok, so the plate looked nice but the fish was dry and warm (I like my food hot unless its supposed to be cold).  It had absolutely no flavor.  Blackened is supposed to be very flavorful people!  The fish chunks tasted like stale, warm, low-sodium canned tuna with a hint of, I don't know, garlic powder maybe??  It had a smear of avocado, a few shreds of white cabbage, a few shreds of cheese and a drizzle of \"white cilantro sauce\" which was so scant that I couldn't even taste it.  It was decoration, I guess. For my 1 side I chose the refried beans.  Yuk!  Tastes like cheap canned beans.  I ordered a dos XX special lager on tap and it was flat and watered down.  Even the beer was a hot mess.  And here I am in shock!  I'm not quite sure what all the hype is about. This place was not very good at all.  And I don't plan on going again.  Ever!  If I want good fish tacos, I'll go to the pros... Authentic Mexican.  I'm done!  What a disappointment!",

    "text": "Overall? Mostly awesome. We came about 6pm on a Tuesday night. We went to the bar as we were still waiting for another to join our group. We had heard good things about the house margaritas so we decided to try them. Hey, only $6, so not really a risk. Then...OMG....who uses Cuervo in their house margaritas?! They were perfect with the house made sour mix. It was also Mexican Beer night with 1/2 off all said draft beers. We each tried a few that the very friendly and personable bartender recommended. All good. Our bar tab for 5 beers and 2 margaritas ended up being about $20. Not bad at all.  Finally our 3rd guest arrived and we were seated right away. (Quite a rarity, I've heard, even on a weekday night.) The other 2 had the BBQ Mahi tacos and I had the Wahoo. All excellent. The only other place I have had such good fish tacos was in San Diego. Now, it was obvious that the rice and beans that the tacos come with were pre-plated for some time. This is just fine because they tasted great and it's probably the reason our meals arrived less than ten minutes after ordering. Overall a great atmosphere, average service and well above average fish tacos.  -Side Note: The \"Corn Salsa\". Interesting and Unique. I'm not a fan. It's not bad, just not my thing. I prefer a spicier, more tomato based version. I wish they gave a few options.",

We ordered their unique fish tacos and some margaritas.  I cannot tell you how TASTY and YUMMY this food was!!  It's kind of messy, so it's not for eating on your first date! Parking sucks, though.  You gotta park a ways away, as the NODA district is usually pretty crowded at night. The staff were very nice and accommodating.  The seating arrangement is tight and not the best design for large groups. They do have two bars, so go to one of those and eat if they're on a wait.",

Which, by the way, is NOT salsa! Perhaps there is a time and place for corn salsa, but not at a taco place to eat with chips as the forerunner to a meal.  The food that we ordered was edible, but not much to say beyond that. I didn't finish the burrito that I ordered which usually doesn't happen. My partner's tacos were... like I said before, edible.  Also, the place just felt dirty, like there was a film of grease over every surface.  We won't return.",

I knew the evening would be great would we pulled up and the parking spot closest to the door was open. I was able to do a quick, illegal U-turn and whip my RAV 4 right into the parallel spot LIKE A BOSS.  Anyway, we were greeted by the hostesses and sat in a quaint, two person table along the left wall. Our server was fantastic - she gave us the right amount of time to decide on our margar selections (an important choice, for sure) and had our drinks out to us in a jiffy. We both ordered burritos - I got the carne asada burrito with a side of fruit. They accidentally brought me the wrong side, but quickly corrected it and let me have both sides! My burrito was delicious - steak was tender and perfectly spicy for me. My side of fruit was excellent.   It got more crowded as the night went on, but the atmosphere was still good for a chat with my main squeeze.  I highly recommend Cabo Fish Taco.",

We loved the corn salsa & chips to start. The corn salsa was sweet to start with a nice kick of heat at the end. We had the steak tacos, the lemon grilled shrimp tacos, the tavaroo tuna tacos, the carne asada & the honey salmon tacos. Everyone had a distinct flavor & were delicious. My favorite were the shrimp because I loved the pickled red onions that were on top. Their sides are great. Definitely recommend the mexi slaw & the napolito salad. My son had the churros with the chocolate dipping sauce, which were made to perfection. They were fried but not greasy.  If you go on a Friday or Saturday expect to wait but I can tell you it was worth it.  You will not be disappointed.",

The chips were bad, the guacamole was the worst I've ever had, not fresh and pretty disgusting. My carne asada taco was so over cooked and bland. My side of black beans and rice were so dry, I couldn't even eat them. How do you mess up beans and rice?! I am still so confused about this place and really hate that I wasted a meal here. I love reading the other negative reviews so I feel justified. Will not return.",

This gave us the opportunity to walk around and check out some of the local shops instead of standing around and waiting. Once we were seated out waitress was very friendly and offered recommendations on food and drinks. They had a great selection of local beers and cocktails. We ordered cheese dip, bbq mahi tacos, and soy ginger shrimp tacos. The food was delicious and we had such a great time here! It has a good casual vibe and we will definitely come back!",

We went for lunch on a hot day, but still chose to sit outside on the patio- it was lovely! Shaded and there was a ceiling fan, so we weren't uncomfortable at all. I felt like I was on vacation in a tropical place!  The chips and salsa weren't anything special. The chips tasted a little stale tbh, and the salsa was mostly corn and not very flavorful. But I got the Tavarua Tuna Tacos and LOVED them. Extra star on this review just for these tacos- so flavorful and fresh. I would definitely order them again! My husband also enjoyed his lemony shrimp tacos.   The service was also lovely. The food came out quickly. A good meal!",

    "text": "Wow. This, man. I can't even. I seriously want to move to Charlotte so I can eat here more! We decided to come here due to the Yelp reviews, personal recommendations and the fact that it was on Diner, drive-Ins and Dives. So many good things so I couldn't imagine having a bad experience here, and we certainly didn't! We started off with Guacamole. Holy Moly. It was easily the best Guac I've ever had. It was so smooth! And the taste was great. My boyfriend was convinced it \"came from a can\". Not sure if guacamole has ever come from a can....hahaa. But he was meaning that it wasn't made fresh. Not sure how he was able to tell this, or if it was True. But it didn't stop me from devouring it. yum.  We both got the same Margarita, The Perfect Wave. We got ours on the rocks. Our Margs were delicious! Very happy about that. Really wish we got \"Mas\" for $3 more. Ugh! Next time!  For my meal I got 1 BBQ Mahi-Mahi taco and 1 Tavarua Tuna Taco. I got the Mahi-Mahi taco because it was recommended and that was the one on the show. And I chose the Tuna taco because our waitress said that the Honey Wasabi Sauce was THE BEST. Oh my gosh, yes. And this place does not skimp on the fish! We had huge chunks that were basically bursting out of the tacos. So both were equally amazing. I seriously kept going back and forth to pick a \"best\" and I couldn't. So, just know that you CAN mix and match your tacos! For my side I chose the cheddar jalapeno mashed potatoes and they were delicious! Nothing was bad here. Not even our service! We had an AMAZING time here. Food and atmosphere are on point!",

    "text": "Very trendy place to get tacos. It does get pretty loud in the restaurant at peak hours. I was initially a bit skeptical about the price ($12 for 2 tacos and a side) but was very pleased with the amount of fish/meat in my meal. You are allowed to mix and match any taco on the menu, so I went with two of their specialty tacos - lemon grilled shrimp and honey soy glazed salmon. Out of the two, both were extremely flavorful and juicy, but the salmon was just cooked extremely well and the sauce was divine. I also enjoyed the semi crispy taco shells, that was a first. I think the sides could be improved, however. I got sauteed veggies as a side and they could do with a bit more flavor. But overall, a very satisfying meal.   Service was slow-ish and our server didn't seem very interested at all but it was fine.   It was hard to find free street parking on a busy night but there is a paid lot nearby.",

    "text": "We were really excited to come here because it's that place that everyone seems to mention when you talk about Charlotte. Overall, it wasn't bad but just underwhelming.   The corn salsa that comes for free with the chips was really tasty and nice because it was something different from regular old salsa. Chips were fine but not salted at all. We also had the queso which was more reminiscent of macaroni-and-cheese sauce than Mexican queso. It was pretty good just not what we expected.   You can mix and match any two tacos which was nice, and the tacos are huge. I had carne asada and blackened mahi. The carne was good but had a lot going on between the red pepper sauce, veggies, shredded lettuce, avocado, and cheese. Unfortunately my mahi was extremely over cooked and quite fishy tasting. The blackened seasoning gave little flavor and absolutely no spice. We asked for house hot sauce but they don't have any which is a bummer for a taco place. My husband had the carne taco and fried whitefish tacos. He really liked the whitefish and I thought it was well cooked but again lacked salt or any distinct flavor. I also tried my friend's tavarua tuna taco which is honestly what bumped this review from 2 stars to 3. It was well-seasoned and perfectly cooked.  I had the \"spicy avocado pasta salad\" as my side which I enjoyed but was not spicy at all. Like not even a little bit. My husband had the rice and beans which were overwhelmingly saturated with parsley. Again everything needed salt.   Service was excellent! It's a bummer the food wasn't better.",

Let me tell you that those honey salmon tacos are the TRUTH. It was so delicious that I wanted to get three more of them but sadly I only had one.   The portions here are plentiful and everyone else in my party enjoyed their food as well. This is a great spot to hangout on the weekends but be warned that it can get loud in here! The service was good and our waitress checked up on us a few times and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  SN: for some reason they only had one mens restroom and a unisex bathroom.

I was better off getting two of these instead of the shrimp taco but it was good. The special sauce and pickled veggies on top of the tacos are also worth mentioning! Nothing was too spicy or overwhelming either.   Other things to mention is that their salsa is jam packed with corn, so don't expect the regular salsa here. It's good, just different!

My food came displayed how I imagine the OG Thanksgiving dinner looked, in a cornucopia - almost too pretty to eat. Don't worry, I ate it and it was scrumptious.   Cabo is unique, not only are the wall art installations funky, but the menus have something for everyone. Trust me when I say everyone! You can feel comfortable taking anyone here and knowing they will find something they love.   Be sure you get your tofu grilled not blacked. Blackened ia good, but grilled has the taste of summer and it sits well with the fresh veggies and cilantro rice.   Get crazy here Nd try something outside of your norm. It won't let you down!",

Being right in the middle of NoDa, Cabo Fish Taco tries to embrace the NoDa vibes with some quirky artwork, but just misses the mark a bit.  My stomach has never agreed with Cabo based on the three times I've eaten tacos there (not a great sign). I also just can't get over the fact that every time I've gone, THE CHIPS HAVE BEEN STALE. This is mind-boggling to me, since they serve so many chips every day. I will admit, the spicy avocado salad is a REALLY solid pasta salad, so definitely snag that as a side if you're dining there!",

    "text": "Wait, did I just step into a beach island club, or a restaurant in NoDa. I can't tell. There's some crazy loud music that's not *all* bad, and there's a nice breeze on the veranda, and food that resembles baja mexican, but, ehhh not quite. So, I don't know, I'm confused. I want to like it, it's so close.   Atmosphere:  This is the only real reason to come here. As far as places go in NoDa, it's got some sense of style and some decent music that jams out onto the patio. It's a noisy place, so if you're a big whiny-baby that can't take some loud conversations over top of some fairly loud music, perhaps you'll be better off somewhere else, because the food won't make it worth it for you.   Food Leaves a lot to be desired. The teriaki sauce dishes are pretty terrible. I keep forgetting that and ordering them, then throw a little fit inside myself for not remembering. The salsa they bring out at the beginning is fresh corn salsa that is ok, but they give you a heap of it on a tiny tiny children's toy of a plate, so you focus like Frodo trying not to dump it all over the table each scoop.   Service:  Nothing special. Some nice folks here, they do their job and nothing more.   Celebrity most likely to enjoy eating here:  Perhaps someone from the Jersey shore. They seem to like noisy clubs and their spray tan makes me think they are mexican.   Half hour to live and I have to get my last meal here:  I'd just eat the free salsa and get drunk on some mojitos.",

Really glad they did, I ordered the lemon grilled taco with refried beans.  My wife ordered the beer battered white fish taco.  My Grandmothers ordered the salmon tacos.  We decided to mix and match to try all three and I must say all three were amazing.  The grilled shrimp taco had wonderful flavor, loved the basil and sauce that it was served with.  Also, I love how each flour tortillas is fried to a perfect crispness.  The white fish taco had a nice crunch to it, the salmon taco tasted great as well.  The salmon had a really nice grilled flavor.  Their retried beans were great and the avocado pasta salad had a nice bite to it.  The only item, I did not have was the complementary chips and salsa.  The chips were good, but the salsa was terrible.  It had a lot of corn and red onions, to this tasted more like a coke slaw than your typical salsa.   In summary if, I lived here, I would definitely frequent this place.",

The corn salsa was mild, but different and good.  I got the tuna tacos and thought they were good but not phenomenal.  There were a lot of flavors going on and I don't think they really complemented each other.  Also, the tortilla was a little dry/crunchy.  I'd prefer a little softer, otherwise it equates in my mind as stale.  The service was good, but we did go at a less busy time.  I enjoyed the strange green people art on the walls.

Since I enjoyed it so much then, I requested a repeat visit when I headed back to Charlotte last month.   I was not disappointed. I went all out with soup and an entree.  My soup was of the curry shrimp and chicken variety.  It was on the Specials board and sounded too interesting to pass up.  On a rare (I'm told) snowy night in Charlotte, this soup was the perfect way to start my meal.  Oh, accompanied of course with a delicious margarita, of course! For my main course I chose the mahi tacos with rice and beans.  It did not disppoint.  I was so full from the soup that I really didn't need to eat it all but I certainly did.   My co-diners were less than thrilled with their main entrees however one of them also thoroughly enjoyed the soup so it wasn't a total loss for them.  Overall the experiece was good for all and when they go back (sadly without me!) I am sure they will go back to their old favorites.   SInce I have been back, the restaurant has expanded and so combined with the snow, that meant that we did not have to wait for a table although that might not be the case on a normal Charlotte night.    Out of towners, I suggest you ask your hosts to take you there on your next visit!",

The first time I visited, I ordered the queso dip as an appetizer and the Cabo Fish Taco. The ingredients were fresh and the tortilla was delicious but there was nothing spectacular about the flavor profiles. I visited a second time and ordered the same dish to give it another shot and I was again left wanting more. The side dishes also leave something to be desired. I would be willing to visit again and try something new but definitely no time soon. It is also incredibly loud which is somewhat of a downer if you want to actually talk to your dinner companions.",

Chicken Quesadilla is awesome (I have ordered it as both an appetizer and entree in the same meal before, it is that good), colorful waitstaff, good margaritas and large selection of mexican beer at a good price.  A few months ago they had a waiter that looked and acted like captain Jack Sparrow and somehow pulled it off (although he kept calling me darling).  No reservations, be prepared to wait (only downside).  Skip the queso.  Fish taco is also solid.  Make sure you don't go on a gallery crawl night or it will be a 2+ hour wait.  Also, the hostess here is typically rude and the times they give are meaningless (we were told over two hours and called within 15 minutes) - I wish they would just take reservations or get a decent hostess)",

I'm surprised that I haven't gotten around to write a review about Cabo until now.  The place is pretty loud especially during peak times (Friday and Saturday nights) but it has a fun and funky vibe. If you plan to go during peak times, be prepared to wait. However, the plus sides are that they text you when your table is ready and there are a number shops and bars to stop in while you wait.  In my recent visits, the waitstaff has been SUPER friendly and accommodating. You automatically start off with a small-ish bowl of corn salsa and chips. Personally, I recommend getting one of their signature margaritas. I usually stick with the skinny margarita. As for the tacos, I'm a fan of the BBQ mahi mahi tacos with rice and beans. The rice and beans aren't the greatest but a sufficient enough side choice for myself.  If you are a fan of fish tacos and a laid back time, Cabo is a good choice!",

I went last night as some friends from other areas that wanted to go.  Our service was terrible, the lady was nice but we sat there for 30 minutes trying to flag her down to order the food and our drink were all mixed up.  We order their cheese dip, that was cold and chunky with the blocks of unmelted gelatinous cheese.  The confusion continued when the food arrive and we all again did the shuffle at our table to obtain our correct orders. No one finished their food, as it all was cool or tepid at best.  The flavor was bland with the sharpe overwhelming taste of raw onions.  It took another 10 minutes to get the checks, while during this time we had even more time to enjoy the atmosphere and restaurant wild life.  As a mouse had decided to use this time to make its appearance. Which quickly turn an unsatisfactory visit in to a gut rolling thought of, \"if there is a mouse in the dinning room, what does the kitchen look like\".  We tried our best to leave post haste but we're still waiting on the bills. As to continue with the theme of the evening no one had the correct bill, once we had corrected this we all pay and left as soon as was possible.  To clarify further, we were sat at 7:10ish on Monday (2/11), there were five of us, most of whom have been in the restaurant industry for a number of years. The restaurant was on the low side of moderately filled for a Monday dinner service.",

For the entrees the Mrs. had the Carne Asada tacos and I had the Tavarua Wahoo tacos (tuna was substituted for the wahoo). As our normal procedure we always share our order.  The wahoo had a bit of a kick from the honey wasabi sauce.  The Carne Asada was tender and milder with a roasted tomato sauce.   This is a definitely a divey place,  with eclectic artwork from local artists on the walls. They also serve local craft beers which I didn't have an opportunity to try. Maybe next time when I am in town. :)",

    "text": "A bunch of us were visiting a friend of ours in Charlotte this past weekend and we came here twice, since it's my friends go-to spot!  Being vegetarian, I was a bit skeptical due to the name of the restaurant and I didn't want their random veggie option that they throw on the menu to accommodate the non-meat eaters and typically would just be a crappy taco with some veggies.  However, I glanced at their menu and other Yelp reviews on our drive over, and I was thoroughly impressed with the amount of vegetarian options they had - burrito, fajitas, and a couple of tacos.  They also weren't 'cookie-cutter' and seemed innovative and tasty.  This place is HUGE.  It's (I believe) in an up-&-coming neighborhood of NoDa, and there is new construction being built left and right.  There's tables all over the place in the massive space, with a small bar in the back center.  Off to the side, there's another room with tables/booths, and a small, covered patio for outdoor seating.  Both times we went, we sat on the outdoor patio as the ceiling helps with the heat.  The only knock is that they may not have all their beers on tap - when a few of us came on Friday for lunch, my friend ordered three different beers, and each time, the bartender told us that they were out.  Being from Philly/New York, I have to say the service was impeccable.  Everyone is super nice and friendly, but I also guess that's the norm down here.  Our waitress, both experiences, came to our table to check up on us often.  Onto the food...they start you off with some chips and fresh, homemade salsa with diced tomatoes, cut onions, and corn.  It was simple, and refreshing...they even threw in some black pepper to give it a little kick.  They also keep refilling them for you, which is a blessing and a curse.  For my meal, I got the beer-battered tofu tacos on Friday and the sweet thai chili tofu tacos on Sunday.  Both were delicious and packed with crispy, fried tofu chunks.  If I had to pick, I'd lean towards the sweet thai chili as they packed a more flavorful punch.  The beer-battered ones were a bit dry, as I head to drench cholula into it to make the flavor profile stand out because the white ranchero sauce wasn't doing a whole lot.  They come in a crispy, chalupa-like shell, which is great because most veggie tacos are runny and break apart easily as the liquids from the veggies get all over the place.  However, these stayed in tact and gave it a nice crunch to it.  I must warn you - they put A LOT of tofu in it.  I don't know if they're trying to make up for the fact that it's vegetarian, but I easily took out at least 3-4 pieces of tofu in each taco so I could eat it easily.  Overall, a solid place, and can definitely see why they're always packed for lunch and dinner.  My friends who eat meat loved their dishes - whether it was the mahi mahi tacos, the carne asada, or the shrimp.",

It was really good less spicy than expected but it had a great bbq sauce on it. The shrimp were over a delicious salad that was fresh with a balsamic dressing. The dressing was good but not really needed with the sauce of the shrimp. I would have never thought of this place to have light options but it was a great choice for a variety of options.",

The one side i cannot get enough of and venture to try other sides is the avocado pasta salad. It's so delicious and has the right kick! Nothing beats it, and it's probably one of my favorite side dishes, ever!!!",

We went on a Friday night thinking we'd have to wait but were surprised to find no wait and a simply smooth, and enjoyable experience. Our waiter was very nice and helpful. I got the Sweet Thai chili tofu tacos with the tofu grilled instead of fried in beer batter. For my side I chose the avocado pasta. My husband had the grilled salmon tacos with refried beans as his side. All of their sides are vegetarian. I LOVED his tacos. Definitely felt it tasted better than mine although mine was decent.  You can park on the street. We were roaming through Noda where everything is walking distance so this was the perfect spot to eat.  I'm so glad we came here and recommend it to anyone visiting!",

Who knew??? Brunch time seated immediately. I think we made the last three available tables. Thank goodness because the food was exceptional, the drinks were toxic, the staff was helpful and the ambiance was a typical Saturday, busy morning. Loved every bit of it. My Baja Bowl was so pretty and I had two people order the same thing based on my choice. A great one I might add. Also this restaurant is in a great location. Who doesn't love NODA!!!!!!(that was a statement)",

    "text": "My husband and I have been working our way through the Diners, Drives-Ins, and Dives featured restaurants, albeit slowly.  Today we dropped off our girl at Pit Road Bar & Grill (another interesting DDD featured choice... an indoor go-cart place) for a birthday party and hightailed it to Cabo Fish Taco in NoDa.    I scanned the Yelp reviews on the way and noticed a trend.  Get the BBQ tilapa taco, get the tuna tilapia, get the crab dip appetizer, get Michelle as your server.  Since her birthday party was early in the day we stopped in around 11:45 am on a Saturday.  Parking was light and we found a great street spot with no problem.  Walked in to rather snippy hostess who walked us to a miniature table for two (I mention this because every single other couple was seated at a table for four).    Everything changed then because we got...Michelle...as our server.  I got stitches in my hand recently and what was a crappy doctor visit became good because the the PA who stitched me up was awesome.  Same thing here... if you go to CFT, you want Michelle, she's awesome.  I listened to the other servers making their presentations, but they just weren't the same.  She knows her stuff and has personality, to boot.  I like to tell servers when it's my first visit.  Yes, I've done my homework online first.  Yes, I generally know my order.  But I care about their opinion.  Michelle's face brightened up when I said it was our first visit and she walked us through the menu.  Interestingly, it generally mimicked what I found on here from the reviewers.  Get the tacos, she said, for your first time.  Get the BBQ mahi mahi, get the wasabi tuna.  Get the crab dip starter.  Ok, then, sounds perfect.  My husband, who loves to challenge me to see if he can order the best meal when we go out orders the wasabi tuna (avarua (Tav-A-Roo) Tuna Tacos $11.50 Blackened lemon rubbed tuna in a kiwi-pineapple fajita sauce, stuffed with lettuce, tomato, mixed cheeses & topped with our honey wasabi sauce.) OMG.  He wins. He so freakin wins.  For $12.95 you can mix and match two tacos.  So I, following Yelp reviewers, order 1 Tilapia taco (Grilled mango BBQ mahi-mahi tacos stuffed with cabo slaw, tomato, avocado, mixed cheeses & finished with our cilantro white sauce.) and 1 Carne Asada taco (Grilled steak sauteed in a roasted red tomato sauce with peppers & onions, stuffed with lettuce, tomato & mixed cheeses.)  They were both good, very good.  But Todd still wins.    The tuna tacos are AMAZING.  He got medium which was a smidgey pink in the middle.  The tilapia, which reviewers seemed to love the most, was fine. I won't get it again.  I preferred the carne asada but wasn't fond of he peppers and onions.  All tacos are fork and knife.  No need to pick up.  They are overfilled and waaaaaay more than needed for lunch.  Since I love restaurant leftovers, this was a plus for me and a plus for my wallet.  The crab dip turned out to be crab and shrimp dip with outrageous deep-fried pita corners that had just come out of the fryer.  I commented on how bad they were for me and then ate about 1000 of them. It came out just minutes after ordering, piping hot, with a very, very generous serving amount, we took this home, too.    We were given a fresh salsa and chips upon being seated, a combination of roasted corn, tomatoes and scant seasoning.  I'd recommend ordering an appetizer because the chips were the bagged chip variety, cold, and the salsa extremely bland.  For sides, we got the refried beans (yummy) and the seasonal side which was jalapeno mashed potatoes.  They had some real kick to them so be prepared.  They were cold though so I wasn't really a fan.  Have you ever gone to bed thinking about your meal and your leftovers waiting in the fridge?  I went up to do ironing and then eventually gave in to come back down to snack because I wanted the crab dip and Todd's wasabi tuna tacos.  Obsessively so. This is a big rave.  I'm going back.",

    "text": "My friends in Charlotte raved about Cabo Fish Tacos and finally got a chance to try and boy was I surprised how good it was! It's really large and loud inside, and parking was hard to find so we had to pay for a spot nearby.   Although I had been on a taco kick the past few days before, I knew I had to try their staple. Our server was super sweet, wish I caught her name, and helped me choose my tacos. Originally I was leaning towards the fried tacos because fried food is always better, but she told me her favorites were the lemon grilled shrimp tacos and the honey soy glazed salmon tacos. I was hesitant about the sauces, so she said they would be on the side. You also get a choice of a side and I went with the spicy avocado pasta salad. I was hungry.  We munched on the chips and really yummy corn salsa and my glass of wine was delicious as well. When our food came out, the tacos were larger than I had imagined. Unfortunately they forgot to put the sauce on the side, but I liked them both!  The salmon was my absolute favorite, fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce was superb. The lemon shrimp were tasty as well, and all the trimmings inside the taco were a perfect combo. The avocado pasta salad reminded me of a pesto pasta but it was really good. I demolished my entire meal to the last bite!  Will be back if I'm ever back in the area! Very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get!",

I was excited! We sat in the covered patio area. It was warm but very loud.   Our server was super sweet and attentive. Everyone got tacos and they were all satisfied with it. I got the grilled salmon taco and carne asada taco. Both delicious and fresh!! Filled with toppings!! I got the avocado spicy pasta salad which I highly recommend. Bursting with flavor and just perfect. I could of honestly just eaten that and be happy.   We didn't have any issues with parking. The only thing I don't like about this place is that there is two bathrooms total for men and women to share. I had to wait in line with 4 people in front of me.",

The service was excellent with our waitress being very attentive, especially for lunch hour during a work day. We ordered the crab dip as an appetizer and it was really good and came with so many toasted pitas we couldn't even finish it. We ordered a honey soy glazed salmon taco and a bbq mahi mahi taco. Some of the best tacos I have had! The sauce was nicely drizzled and the portion was perfect. The tacos also came with sides of avocado salad and chickpeas which complimented the main dishes well. Would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the Charlotte area!",

There are quite a few eating places in the area and it's just a great area of Charlotte to hang out.  The table salsa had just the right amount of heat. I love spicy so it didn't bother me one bit. But why did we order the crab dip? BEING GREEDY! It was so amazing...I mean, you want to fill up your bathtub and lather it all over your body AMAZING! And those pitas they serve with it...just order it and thank me later. I'd drive from the University City area just to have that dip.  I had one of the TAVARUA tacos and the Sweet Thai chili tofu taco. Loved them both, especially the tofu because it was crisp and yummy, I just wish there was more heat in the sauce, but that's just me. The tavarua taco was really good as well. I'm thinking they may have left the wasabi off of mine because I didn't taste it at all. Next time I'll be sure to ask for it on the side.  Our server was really very nice. We shall return.",

We only had a 20 minute wait on a mid day Saturday afternoon for a table for four in what appeared to a crowded fan favored restaurant. My nephew who lives in Charlotte had been there once before. He thought it was a good place to try as one of my Food Network featured Charlotte restaurant locations.  Cabo Fish Taco didn't disappoint! The server was very pleasant and steered us in the right food direction with our food choices. We had the Crab & Shrimp Dip, BBQ Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos, Lemon Grilled Shrimp Tacos, Chicken Quesadillas and Southside Chicken Wrap Burrito. We ordered the \"Bannas Foster Cheescake (just okay) and Peanut Butter Chocolate Mousse Cake\" (a better choice) desserts to go, but ended up eating them there!  We all were pleased with our selections, especially the warm \"Crab & Shrimp Dip\" appeitizer (featured on the FN episode) freshly made pita toast points. The \"BBQ Mahi Mahi\" Fish Tacos (also featured on the FN episode) was our favorite entree of them all. The free salas (Chopped Tomato, Corn and Cilantro) was a refreshing change compare to other table side Mexican salas.  If ever in Charlotte, NC again, I would make a track over to this place no doubt!!",

We were immediately seated and our drink orders taken. We decided to split the queso and a chicken quesadilla. Our waitress (as listed per the receipt) was JWOO. She was spunky with piercings and was perfect. She was quick and even asked the kitchen to split the quesadilla between 2 plates since we were splitting (that goes a long way).   The food was excellent, although I think the queso is meant to be taken down in 5 minutes, because once it starts cooling off it can get a bit hard.   Overall we had a great time and will be back, especially if going to Dog Bar.",

    "text": "We saw that \"Cabo Fish Taco\" in Charlotte, NC was on the Food Network so we decided to check it out.  I ordered the Mahi BBQ Taco and it was very good.  Filling delicious flavor.  I really liked the taco shell.  Everything about it was delicious.  My side was the vegetable medley and it looked and tasted old.  It was not steamed recently or if it was it sat for a while.     I also got a the Tavarua Tuna Tacos which I was not happy with.  Dont get me wrong I love me some Tuna.. I love fresh sushi, grilled tuna (salt & pepper), and even tuna fish holds a special place in my heart.  The Tuna from Cabo Fish Taco really tasted off.  I was really disappointed since I though this was going to be the highlight of my dinner.  It was very fishy tasting so much so that I did not finish the Tuna.    My friend John got the Lemon Grilled Shrimp Tacos and was not happy.  I tried the shrimp and it did not taste fresh.  Very Bland...   The salsa that is brought to the table was refreshing and had a good amount of corn in it.  We really enjoyed it.    Overall a decent restaurant but the management may want to taste the seafood without all the sauces on it.  If it doesn't taste fresh all on its own its not going to taste fresh mixed in a taco.",

    "text": "I CANNOT believe this place was featured on diners, drive-ins, and dives. HOLY SHIT. That may have been like a decade ago cause this place sucks now. First, the nachos were soggy. I have never ever had soggy nachos at any restaurant before, so that really disgusted me, especially since both our baskets of nachos had soggy nachos! Second, the water tasted disgusting. Third, the rice had a horrible aftertaste. Fourth, I got beer battered shrimp and fish, to be safe, and it was nasty. I was so hungry and literally I just stopped eating because of how disgusted I was. Finally, the guacamole was disgusting and unnatural. It look like it was scooped out of a jar and place on a plate. Furthermore, a child with my party found a hard substance in her food and just gave up eating, a child was disgusted. Also, I don't have to ask for lemon/limes when I get seafood, that should come with the seafood. Like salt with pepper, common sense. I tried to eat the fish and shrimp without lemon and it was nasty. The only good thing about this place is that the woman's bathroom was super clean. The cleanliness of the bathroom is what warned this place one star. The tables were dirty, so that sucks that the bathroom was wayyyy cleaner than the tables lol.",

Next we ordered a side of queso, which was delicious.  More flavor than your typical white queso, very good, especially when we mixed a bit of the corn salsa with it.  Next was the task of figuring out what to order for dinner and because it was our first time we didn't know quite what to order.  Tacos and quesadillas are cool, but we came here to try something new.  So we relied on a recommendation from the waiter.. the Baja Bowl with soy glazed salmon and honey wasabi sauce on the side... YUM!! That was a great choice.  The manager was really cool, she came and checked on us twice just to make sure we were enjoying everything, and we did!  Next time i'll have to try the Rasta Pasta.",

The white sauce is the best, I always order an extra side of it. The mashers (mashed potatoes) are great. They are obviously made from scratch and are some of the best I've ever had.

Nothing like the first one that was made. And this was the same bartender. Oh well. Next time I'll get beer, that's always reliable. The guac was good but a little salty. The corn salsa that's on the table was hands down the best!!! I filled up mostly on that. So yummy. Prices overall were not bad so I will go back for the tacos. The rating is 100% on the tacos.

After my last experience there, I can now say that it was a \"me problem!\"  I just didn't order the right thing.   I finally tried the tacos rather than going the burrito or wrap route.  The tacos, my friends, are legit.  I got the tuna taco with the wasabi honey sauce and the tofu taco with Thai chili.  Boo yah!  They were both tasty, with an edge to the tuna.    Now I see why people wait an hour and a half on the weekend to eat here.  Just be prepared to experience that wait.  And when you finally get seated, order tacos!",

Rice was dry and crunchy. Pasta tastes like paste. Guacamole tastes like grocery store guac. Their beans were too mushy. Service was spotty, and she was not that friendly or helpful.

Entires ordered:  - blackened chicken quesadilla;  - epic tuna burrito;  - blackened mahi mahi tacos;  - blackened grilled amberjack tacos (on special)  This is my second visit to this restaurant, previously I would haven given this -1/2 star.   Chips and salsa:  the other 3 in the party loved the salsa, it is a corn/tomato salsa. Personally, I am not a fan of this type of salsa, I like the traditional kind so I'm not able to provide an unbiased review. The chips have a stale texture, this is consistent from both visits, this may be just how the chips are supposed to be. Not a fan personally here either.   Entrees:  Blackened chicken quesadilla (mine) - not your standard quesadilla, not overloaded with cheese. Good balance of chicken-to-cheese ratio. The blackening is second to none, this was an pleasant surprise and delivered a very nice kick. Onions and peppers were good, not too much, just the right amount. I don't eat seafood, that's why I didn't get a \"fish taco.\"   Epic tuna burrito- very good, comparable in quality/flavor of fresh California fish (according to the diner)  Blackened mahi tacos- delicious.   Blackened amberjack - the diner went on and on about these, refused to try anything else because she didn't want to \"ruin her palate.\" (Tad dramatic if you ask me, but what do I know).   My review rating is based upon my entree and the opinions voiced by my cohorts. They truly loved everything (although they did share my feelings on the \"stale chips\").   My original experience was terrible, I don't remember what I had exactly but it was bad enough that I successfully boycotted this place 3 years. However, after the blackened chicken quesadilla, I will be willing to return.   Also, one had a Bloody Mary (on special) and said it was \"delicious.\"   Note: parking is a real pain, just be prepared for that.",

    "text": "Good, but definitely not as good as it used to be.  Eleven dollars for two small tacos with hardly any fish or shrimp in either of them but way too much cilantro, plus a small side of beans of rice.  All of our flour taco shells were so chewy that we could barely eat them.  Give customers a choice because flour does NOT taste better, plus there's that whole gluten-free craze.  Draft beers were very pricey for a restaurant.  Not in much of a hurry to go back.  The food is fresh though,which is whey they barely earn three stars.",

We had the pleasure of Jeremy yesterday as our waiter and he went above and beyond and made our visit even more enjoyable.  We always have a great meal and great time here and the food is always amazing so it's hard to get 'any better' but Jeremy is a first class act when it comes to customer service and left us talking about how soon we will be back!!!  Cant wait to get my next 'fix' of all that Cabo Fish Taco has to offer!!!! YUMMMMY!",

    "text": "Can 14 years make a difference in the life of a restaurant?  At Cabo Fish Taco the answer is a resounding NO!  The last time before this week that I had a meal there was 2000.  At the end of my meal I remarked that the fish was overcooked, tasteless and served barely above room temperature.  The service was at best mediocre.  As we were in the area, a friend suggested we go there for lunch.  I hesitated for a moment, but then figured they had to get better after 14 years.  WRONG!  Someone please tell me how/why this place is still in business!  Whatever that corn stuff they bring to the table is was horrible.  None of the condiments at the table could make it much better.  Our waitress (in training) was pleasant enough.  She recommended a daily special - Curried Fish (trout I believe) Taco.  I had actually been in the mood for Indian food that day, so a Curried Fish Taco sounded like just the thing.  WRONG!  The curry flavor was so diluted that it tasted as though someone sprinkled just a dash of cheap curry powder on the fish while cooking.  Jenny's Cabo's Signature Taco (beer battered white fish) was dry, overcooked, and EXTRA crunchy.  I surely would not want my signature on that!  Perhaps I will wait another 14 years to see if they are able to earn that third star....",

    "text": "I moved to the Charlotte area about a year ago, and in that time frame, have eaten at Cabo Fish Taco approximately 5 times.  I originally wanted to eat here because of watching it on Triple D, and it has certainly proven to be worth the hype.  I am quite shocked at the number of mediocre to negative reviews on YELP for this restaurant (by my count it currently stands at 40% of reviews being 3 star or below).  This is, by far, one of the best restaurants I have ever been to in my life.  The BBQ Mahi and Tavura Tuna Tacos are incredible and delicious.  The Baha Shrimp dip appetizer is amazing as well.  As far as sides go, they are all good, but the Avocado Pasta Salad is the best.  I've also had the Steak-n-Cheese taco and one of the special fish tacos.  They were good also, but the real stars of this restaurant are the two tacos I mentioned above.  The wait can be bad on weekends but they use an app called NoWait that will allow you to track your wait status on your phone.  This is great compared to the normal method of buzzers because you can go wherever you want during the wait period and just track the updates on your phone.  You will get a text message when your table is ready.  Since NoDA is full of great restaurants and bars, you are able to go have a drink somewhere else while you wait for your table, then quickly walk back once you get the text that your table is ready.  The atmosphere is very chill with a Latin vibe, usually there is some reggae music in the background.  The ONLY thing this place is missing is live music, which I have not seen in my trips thus far.  I think that would really put this place into the upper echelen of chill/hang out places, but still, this is definitely a 5 star place to me.  Don't really get all the negative reviews but as they say \"haters gonna hate.\"",

Once we were seated, it took 30 mins for someone to even take our order and 25 mins to have water brought to our table. Multiple servers and bussers came by our table to replenish the utensils, but they were not concerned that we hadnt ordered and we didnt even have a drink after such a long time. It felt like we were being treated unfairly and we thought about leaving multiple times. We shouldve honestly left because our server didnt seem to feel that bad about the wait. Would not recommend if you want to go somewhere that values your time.",

It is just a perfection medley of flavors. The tuna is always cooked so well....seared with a nice pink inside. The wasabi sauce on it adds that nice bite and kick. Delish.   The avocado pasta salad is my favorite side still. Creamy and tasty with a little spice.  In terms of portions, my husband and I typically split a plate and add an extra a la carte taco. On this occasion, we split the tavaru tacos (2 tacos in the order) and added one BBQ Mahi, which in my opinion is the second best on the menu.   2013 since my original review and Cabo Fish Taco is still (6 years later) one of my favorite eats in Charlotte.",

Whenever I get tacos, I'm usually hip to traditional Mexican style: carne asada, lengua, al pasto, or carnitas. Never do I reach for pescado. But tonight, that all changed. The BBQ Mahi tacos were awesome. Grilled mango BBQ Mahi-Mahi tacos stuffed with Cabo slaw, tomato, avocado, cheese & finished with cilantro white sauce. These tacos are pretty big in size and they come in pairs of two + a side. I could of eaten more, but it's a decent portion size for the average eater. The chunks of fish are humongous. Located in the heart of NoDa, this place does get busy, especially on weekends. Totally worth the wait, so if you commit, there's no decommiting. Please order the Baja shrimp and crab dip as an app to start - it's just as big time as the tacos. The dip is solid, but pay attention to the crispy pita chips. They will remind you of a soft, warm Taco Bell chalupa shell, but better. Both the dip + pita chips complement each other perfectly. Next visit, I'm going to try the honey soy glazed salmon tacos and a quesadilla.",

We had to do a $5 pay lot almost behind the restaurant. My wife and I tried the white fish and tuna tacos. Both were great. The white Fish was beer battered, flaky and crispy! Great taco! My wife liked the tuna, but I wasn't a fan of the seasoning. Medium rare tuna doesn't need all that seasoning on the outside. Just the tuna is suffice for a great taco. The corn salsa app they bring to the table for free with chips had some serious kick! I liked that. My wife did not. Kudos on the refried beans side for having a few toppings to give it more taste and texture than most. And the avocado pasta salad had a great and unique creaminess to it. I highly recommend! We ate for $42 with 1 water, 1 tea, a $6 queso app and our two entrees. That's pricy for usual Mexican food for us. It was good, but with the $5 to park, too, it's not something we'd do again any time soon. Just too expensive. And good food, but not good enough for that cost.",

I recommend the soy ginger. I also liked the salmon taco above the mahi (wasn't a fan of the Bbq sauce). Margaritas are good for the price. It's Noda so the service is 'artistic'. I love the area and will return.   Jeremy was our server (both visits).",

If I could recommend any taco off the menu it would be the BBQ Mahi Mahi fish taco, this isn't your ordinary fish taco, get ready to take you palette to flavor town bc this taco has some mango bbq sauce that will blow your mind  this menu is has everything on it, unfortunately the jalapeno potato mashers were all sold out but I hear this side dish is also a \"go to\" this place gets busy my wife and I had a 20 min wait but by the end boy was it worth it. Very nice atmosphere and reasonable prices, all around it was a great experience. Going back soon!!",

On a Saturday afternoon, a little busy and maybe a little rowdy but they were able to bring us to a table and a very pleasant waiter took our orders.  With not much on the mostly bare walls to break up the sound, it is definitely a little loud in here. A few televisions tuned to sports and news channels but the noise is all people.  Food arrived swiftly and they have an excellent corn salsa to go with their chips. Not exactly easy to scoop and easy but we made do until the guacamole arrived. A nice portion with a good spicy tang to it, yum.  Then the fish tacos. Nice big chunks of fish here and a sauce that had a little zing to it. Delicious and easy to eat though you'll want to fork a few pieces of that fish first to make room. For sides, I would really recommend the avocado pasta salad. Amazing.  Excellent service, great food and reasonable prices. Easy to rate Cabo at Five Stars.",

First, the food is made from high quality ingredients. The chefs pay close attention to flavor profiles and ensure that the tacos taste amazing! I ordered the BBQ magi tacos and the shrimp &a crab dip. I wasn't disappointed. The tacos and fish were cooked to perfection. The dip was good. The pitas that are served along with the dip are amazing!   Now on to my area of suggested growth...the place is small and has a huge following. Prepare to wait for lengthy times. On the other hand, they use the No Wait app so when you check in they communicate to you clearly and efficiently. Our food took a very long time to arrive. The hostess stated that the kitchen was really behind. We waited for close to an hour. The staff is friendly but the wait almost made it not worth the trip. My brother, friends and I were agitated but had a quick mood change when the food arrived because of how good it was.   Overall, the place is great. They should consider opening another location or moving to a larger place.",

But when you have waitresses that are not polite, food that comes out one hour after you have ordered them and not cooked to how you've asked them, then you know that something's gotta give. This was obviously not the first time and what makes it difficult to be understanding about these bad experiences, is that they didn't happen on a weekend when they were busy. It happened on a rather mildly busy day, at best. So yeah... I love their food. But I'm afraid my money would be best spent in a place that has both good food, but also good service.",

Unfortunately, the food reminded me of an office party that was \"Mexican\" themed. In which,  people serve salsa, queso , and beans from a can purchased from a local American grocery store. As I prepared myself to eat my shrimp battered tacos, I realized that things weren't getting any better. My tacos were cold, my cheese dip was cold, and my beans were cold too. The corn medley being used as a chip dip should be a crime! That's Tex Mex, NOT Baja at all!!! Also, I have a big problem with having a pasta, guacamole, something or other as a side dish. When we asked for an avocado slice we were informed they didn't have any and they only had guac spread....What?!!! You mean to tell me that my tacos and sides weren't made with fresh avocados?!!!! I have 4 words... NO AVOCADOS FROM MEXICO!!!!   Additionally, my mojito tasted like an alka seltzer, and my waiter was like a student avoiding eye contact so he wouldn't be called on. Overall, this experience has me feeling like Biggie Smalls....\"I'm going back to Cali Cali\"",

    "text": "We came to Cabo Fish Taco while en route to our vacation in Florida and met up with a local friend of ours and his 7 month old.   Beware, put your name on the list because there's gonna be a wait. This joint is crazy popular and for good reason. It's a sizable place but they fill up fast; when we drove by, there were a ton of people waiting outside to be seated. Luckily our friend had our name on the list so we only had about a 15 minute wait by the time we arrived.  They're pretty accommodating of young families, there were a few people with babies and strollers and there's a bit of a stroller parking lot at the front. Took us a bit of finagling to figure out how we were gonna get the stroller parked so it wasn't in the way but we managed. For me, the tables here are a bit too crammed together, especially since its always full. We arrived in time for a 2:30PM lunch and it didn't quiet down by the time we left an hour later.  We all ended up going for the taco stand tacos, you get to pick any two on the menu. I went with one of the daily specials, the pork belly, and the tavarua tuna tacos (\"Blackened lemon rubbed tuna in a kiwi-pineapple fajita sauce, stuffed with avocado, mixed greens, tomato, cheese, & topped w/ honey wasabi sauce\"). We got nachos and corn salsa to snack on while we waited for our tacos. Honestly, not a fan of the corn salsa, not sure what the hype is about but I wasn't a big fan and would pass next time. The chips aren't anything special - we're used to Lone Star (Canadian mexican chain) and they give you fresh fried chips which really really make the difference.  I couldn't believe how fast the tacos came out after we ordered! My hubby got pork belly and the steak and really enjoyed his, he said the steak was almost better outside of the taco, well seasoned and properly cooked. Mine were both good, but the tavarua tacos were a bit on the spicy side for me so I wouldn't get them again. The pork belly was TO DIE FOR. So delicious, some kind of sweet honey sauce on them, I could have eaten five of those. I regretted not trying any of the deep fried tacos, if we go back I'll make a point of trying those.  My main issue with this place is that the whole experience felt really rushed. It's a busy place and its popular for a reason. But I really felt like I didn't get to truly enjoy my food because it was so hustle bustle. With the tables being as close together as they were and people passing us by in the aisles and rubbing up against my chair and that kind of thing, it really interfered with my enjoyment of the experience.  Overall, a really good spot to stop in and try if you're in Charlotte or passing through. The neighbourhood is cute, so even if you end up with a wait, you can wander around the neighbourhood and check out the shops and whatnot. We'll be back the next time we're in the state and see what else they've got to offer.",

Better late than never.  They have huge portion sizes which justifies the price. Loved their house made corn and salsa, which is not the usual kind youl get at other places. Even their margaritas are ate fantastic. I ordered the mahi mahi BBQ taco and I got these two giant tacos with almost a pound of fish ! Never have I ever seen this much in a taco. It had the right amount of spice for me and I just loved my food. My girlfriend ordered tofu with Thai chili sauce and even that was good. Definitely coming back here.",

I've had friends who have tried the burritos and quesadillas, but nothing seems to beat the tacos. Best fish tacos I've ever had. Laid back and chill atmosphere.   Eat here!!",

I've been here a few times for dinner, and the wait is always tremendous. You put your name in with the cool, laid-back hostesses that are always working, and you can walk around NoDa for the remainder of your time.   Once you do get in the door, they greet you with some corn salsa and chips. When the chips are hot, you're in business! It's delicious and a great appetizer for your amazing meal to come.  I've been here a few times, and I've never strayed away from the tacos. I get the two taco plate, and normally like to mix-and-match. The fish is great, battered or grilled, as are the shrimp tacos, battered. I do think my favorite is the battered shrimp tacos, but it really depends on the mood.  It's a very noisy environment, especially at dinner. I've come during lunch and it's still just a loud place to be. Not really a complaint, but I wouldn't call Cabo a date-spot.",

I would've given the place 5 stars if it wasn't for the lack of good margarita choices. All of their margaritas are pre-made with heavy amounts of sour mix. Food 5 stars drinks 3 stars.",

I've been multiple times and I love getting the shrimp tacos. I really enjoyed the avocado pasta salad as well as the complimentary chips and salsa! It's the perfect place to eat during spring when it's nice weather out and you can sit out on the veranda. I wouldn't recommend going at a busy time, mainly because I went once during winter and they don't have a waiting area, at all. We had to stand in front of the door and it got crowded pretty easily, and chilly. They have specials that they advertise on a the wall in chalk and that was very helpful when looking for the specialty drinks they have during specific seasons. The food is super good and you'll always enjoy it, even if you have to wait a bit to find a spot to sit.",

Anyway, the evening I found the penny my fiancee and I decided to celebrate by going back to Cabo. I had an awesome experience there a couple of years back, and this was no different. We were seated promptly and the waitress got waters to us immediately and also got our margaritas out quickly. She answered all the questions we had about the menu in a precise fashion.   I decided on the grilled Mahi Mahi burrito with a side of pasta salad and my fiancee got the Carne Asada burrito with fresh fruit on the side. The food came out quickly and was perfectly cooked. The Mahi Mahi was just spicy enough to break a sweat, but not overpowering. Same with the pasta salad, just enough spice and flavor. No complaints from across the table the Carne Asada was tender and flavorful and the fruit was fresh and succulent.   Still on the hunt for more pennies, and hopefully I'll end up back at Cabo Fish Taco.",

We came in, We stood there like fools while everyone else that came In was being seated and we felt invisible. 4 tables for our size party were open. As I turned to my husband to tell him \"let's leave\" the male standing by the hostess proceeds to yank the menus out of our hands, and then proceeded to escort us out with his body, what the hell?!!  I felt so disrespected and insulted, he then decided to yell at us telling us we were in the wrong. For what? For doing what we were told? We left so confused.

    "text": "I recently had one of the most disappointing experiences in a restaurant that I can remember and it made me want to review one of the best experiences I've had in Charlotte: Cabo Fish Taco. There's a ton that's been said about this place. It's got a lot of hype and lines out the door to prove it. After living in Charlotte for almost 20 years, it was time for me to try it out. And it did not disappoint!  Food- 2/2 *Excellent. Loved the flavors of the BBQ Mahi tacos. We tried several different kinds and loved them all. They were really something I had never tried before. Personally, I loved the corn salsa that comes with the chips. We order an appetizer of queso, and it was also very, very good. One minor note that I believe to be a fluke- the chips seemed a little stale. I haven't read any comments about them before, so it probably was just a bad batch.   Atmosphere- 1/1 *As mentioned elsewhere, it is loud inside. But I didn't sit inside, I waited the extra 15 minutes and sat outside on a beautiful June evening. It was worth the wait. This place fancies itself as a West Coast taco shop and sitting outside, it felt that way to me. I don't know if I would go back and not sit outside. I enjoyed the atmosphere there.   Price- 1/1 *No major complaints. Normally, I would frown on paying $12-15 for two tacos, but they filled me up and is loved them. I'm willing to pay a few extra dollars if I like the food and I leave full.   Service- 1/1 *I cannot write enough good things about the service that we received here. It wasn't that it was over the top or extra attentive. Our waiter was running around like crazy, it was packed. Yet despite the busyness of the evening, our waiter really valued us. He gave great recommendations. It was clear he had tried everything on the menu multiple times. He never missed a refill on drinks or chips. And here's the thing that awesome: I love queso. I will eat every last drop of queso and the lick the bowl. I love queso. Our waiter had noticed me scooping out every last drop and unannounced brought us another bowl of it, free of charge! Now, I didn't need any more queso, since this was after our meal. But this communicated a ton to me: it communicated that he took notice of the experience I was having and he wanted to g out of his way to make sure that I wasn't just having a good night at Cabo, but a great night. Most wait staff don't operate as if it's their restaurant that they are invested in. I don't know who this guy was, but you could tell this was HIS restaurant and that mattered to him. I loved it (both the queso and the gesture). I've never experienced anything quite like that. It was awesome.   I live 30-35 minutes away from NoDa. It's a trendy area and I'm hardly trendy. In fact, most of the time I feel out of place and uncomfortable around so many cool, hip people. Needless to say, I don't stumble into the NoDa area. And yet, I can't wait to go back. The other night I was getting takeout by myself and I wrestled long and hard about making the drive, finding a weird place to park and walking through crowds of people that are much cooler than me just to eat those tacos again. And I don't think I'd feel that way if it weren't for out waiter that night. He was awesome and whoever he is- 'thanks for taking care of us that night. You realize we could have eaten a lot of places and we tried your restaurant. It won't be the last time.'",

C.F.T. is a great spot for lunch, especially on a sunny day, no matter how cold it is outside.  Not much of a seafood person, I got the tacos and was able to get both steak and chicken at the waitress' recommendation.  The chicken is nicely spicy. The steak was a little under-salted but high quality beef and cooked tender.  Service was impeccable and friendly.  She even threw in a few \"hey dudes\" for good measure.  The house corn salsa is chunky and fun.  I wasn't wild about the tomatillo salsa because it had too many onions.  I went for the cactus salad as my side for the tacos and wasn't crazy about it either.  Next time I'll just get the black beans and rice which reprises the fresh corn and has no onions.  I didn't realize the tacos are served on a bed of cabbage so next time I'll ask for them to skip that part.  And I'm glad I asked for the cream based sauce on the side. But everything still had a lot of flavor even after a picky eater like me takes it apart.  Next time I'll order a margarita from their specialty drink menu since they offer my beloved Herradura amidst their impressive tequila selection!",

From a food perspective, I didn't really LOVE the Baja Shrimp & Crab dip (although my coworkers were into it, so who knows...maybe I'm crazy), and I've had better queso. They were fine, but I had a little of each and was over them.   If I were only rating the tacos and the margaritas, this place would have 4 stars. I had the special that day: talapia tacos that were covered in this delicious, spicy, buffalo-ish sauce and done to perfection...they were seriously yummy. And the Pomegranate margaritas were super delish...but then again, I think all of the margaritas are probably pretty good, from what my coworkers have told me. Definitely worth a stop!",

Perfect weather means spending time outside, and that always means a trip to NoDa. And NoDa means good (cheap) food. I want to branch out and try all of the street's fabled offerings but today it was back to a tried and True favorite after a long winter of hibernation: Cabo Fish Taco. They have never done me wrong.  Over the winter they seem to have expanded. A second room has doubled their capacity. And today they needed it all. We were squeezed in amongst the most diverse crowd you'll find in Charlotte - a refreshing reminder that the world is more interesting than the Uptown bar scene. You'll find that all over NoDa, but here especially. I was a little nervous that with the expansion, and with the beautiful day bringing out so many people, the staff might be overwhelmed. Our waitress was a little harried, but she managed to efficiently serve a dozen tables - polite, even if she didn't have time to chat.   Per Bill F's suggestion I went for the blackened mahi-mahi signature taco, and it was awesome. Awesome. That white cilantro sauce is to die for. My only complaint is that I didn't see their complementary salsa on the menu. That stuff was so good I would have loved to buy another serving. It is probably for the best; I couldn't have managed another plate anyway. Just enough room for some Tasty Yo across the street...",

I work in the service industry and I always expect amazing customer service everywhere I go, and she deserves 5 stars!  I hate coming to a new restaurant and the wait staff doesn't explain the menu/concept.  She was very very thorough and so personable.  Some wait staff can be a little too personable and it can get annoying.  But she was the perfect amount.  She explained the menu very well to someone like me who is very indecisive.  And our drinks and chips were never empty (and we had a table of 8).   I think some people may not like the salsa.  It's mainly corn, red onion, tomatoes, lemon juice, cilantro, and maybe some green peppers.  I loved it.  Nice and simple.  I had the tuna rancheros.  It was so good!  The tuna was cooked perfectly and the tomatoes were so juicy and sweet.  I had a bite of my friend's beer battered shrimp taco and it was amazing.  I regretted not getting it, but oh well, I'll just have to go back!  I will definitely be back...very soon!",

Not only is it close to New Life Theological Seminary where I work, but they consistently have great food and great service.  I could make a meal off of the salsa and chips; it is fantastic.   My personal favorite is the Southwest Chicken Wrap, I rank it the best in Charlotte!  This time of the year you can choose a fresh summer fruit cup as a side, an added bonus.  The restaurant is always busy and can sometimes be a little noisy, not the place to hold a business luncheon and parking is limited.",

We ordered fish tacos (what else?) - I had the blackened Mahi and my friend had the breaded whitefish.  The whitefish on her tacos was completely bland, and the breading was far too thick for fish that was to be served on tacos.  My tacos were better - the Mahi-Mahi was actually pretty tasty - but unfortunately nothing was hot.  The rice and beans were lukewarm, and the tacos didn't even come out that hot.  Not appealing at all.  The corn salsa that is served to you when you sit down is really unimpressive, too.  The chips are tasty, but the salsa is totally worthless.  The worst part of CFT was the service.  I don't know if she was just having a bad day, but our server was down right rude.  On more than one occasion I thanked her for bringing me something (my food or a beer) only to have her say nothing in return.  I was not at all impressed.  Moreover, I would have liked to have ordered another beer.  I just wasn't given the opportunity to do so until we were done with everything.  I will probably go back, for I did find the atmosphere to be fun, but if it isn't better on the next visit then I think I will be done with CFT.",

The original offer for a table (after waiting for an hour already) was to split our party into the two separate rooms of the restaurant at twe very distant tables. The server that offered this was not only curt, but her words were \"it makes it really hard on us\" to seat our party. Personally, having worked in the industry for ten years, i would NEVER say something to this affect to a paying customer!  When we were finally seated, there were only a chips and salsa appetizer for almost fifteen minutes before our order was ever taken. When our food was finally delivered, two of the persons in the group were not served. Their food was not delivered to the table until everyone else was finished with our over cooked and very dry tacos. This was something that was never acknowledged as a short coming on the restaurants behalf. At the risk of sounding cheap, there was never an offer to comp their plates, or compensate in any matter.  When it came time to deliver the bill, the server had no idea who had what. The bills were jumbled, and as a matter of fact some of them were even PAID TWICE (considering one of our party felt sympathetic to the futile efforts of the staff and stayed behind as the rest of the party left and later found out the tab had actually been paid) !!! Fortunately for the server, he was paid AND TIPED double for at least one of the tabs for his less than mediocre efforts. I will NEVER return to this restaurant, and recommend anyone with more than three, or four people in their party not confuse and overwhelm the staff by their presence.   Horrible service, food and poor attitudes!",

This thing is stuffed and has some girth on it. Its probably in diameter the size of a Monster energy drink can. I could barely finish it. The meat is so tender and juicy and the suace compliments the contents perfectly. I didn't enjoy the Margarita's so much, not saying they were bad, just...different?. I tried 2 different kinds and while the ingredients sounded good, I have to say I'll pass next time and just order a beer. Love the food though!! Definitely go for the food!!

The restaurant is so good that it's been on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. We started out with the crab dip for an appetizer. The dip was so addicting and delicious. I love crab dishes that have more crab than cream cheese and this certainly did. The flavors that were added to the cream cheese made it even better. The pita chips it came with were fried and tasted like a funnel cake. My practice with moderation was definitely challenged. For my meal, I ordered the guacamole salmon salad with a vinaigrette dressing. The salmon was awesome, but I couldn't eat the lettuce because they poured cilantro all over the plate. I didn't know that it came with cilantro otherwise I would have had them take it off. The next time I went, I ordered it WITHOUT the cilantro and it was better:) The guacamole at this place is awesome!   We always have great service when we're at CFT. My brother, who is a fish taco king, said they had the best fish tacos HE HAS EVER EATEN. That was one hell of a compliment.   The restaurant is very hip and a great place to bring your friends or family who are visiting. It's definitely a touristy-y spot. After dinner, you can walk down the road for some drinks or coffee. Noda is a very hip neighborhood.",

    "text": "First time I came here was for lunch and it was pretty empty. I didn't know what to expect. But what I did know was that the corn salsa was the bomb. The mahi mahi and carne asada tacos were pretty good too. But this last time I went to Cabo Fish Taco will probably be my last unless I'm dragged along with a group of people. It was a really busy weeknight because it was the first time the weather was nice after winter. We put our name and number down and told it would be a 20 minute wait. After about 45 minutes and seeing people get seated before us that arrived after us, we asked the hostess how much longer our wait would be. She immediately sat us down, realizing that we were still there. I had the Honey Wasabi Tuna burrito and it was okay. The thing that made me not want to come back was eating my leftovers the next day. My lips tingled and felt like they were swollen every time I took a bite. I eat raw tuna all of the time. Not sure if this was bad fish or what, but it makes me hesitant to come back.",

The atmosphere is fun and everyone around us seemed to be having a good time!   Ordered the blackened Mahi-Mahi and Tavarua fish tacos, and they were great and a lot bigger than I expected! The Tavarua's wasabi glaze was a little stronger than both my friend and I expected though. The corn salsa was a little bland and we quickly swapped it out for some queso.   Service was a little slow, especially after that wasabi glaze hit and we needed water. But besides that, definitely wouldn't mind bringing old and new friends back to eat!",

Batter was nice and light, not overpowering, and really highlighted the fish.    Also tried the Blackened Mahi Fish taco.  Nice spice! The Mahi was a little dry but when you got a bite of Mahi, cabbage, creama it was perfect.    I'll be back to try the BBQ Mahi fish taco.",

I love that you can choose a specialty taco and substitute any meat, for example if it comes with tofu and you want chicken they will do that for you.

First, I'll say that the food was tasty and the server was as attentive as she most likely could have been given how busy the restaurant was.   My grievance is with how much I was charged: I ordered a burrito, with no wrap and instead on a bed of mixed greens, and no rice substituting extra vegetables. On my bill was a $2 surcharge for a \"side salad\"  (the bed of lettuce equalled maybe half-a-cup of shredded lettuce ... definitely not a side salad) and a $2.25 surcharge for \"extra vegetables.\"   Now, I'm not unreasonable and assumed I'd be charged something for the substitutions but feel like the server should have discussed the charges with me beforehand since they were so outlandish. I wound up paying $17.50 (before tip) for what essentially was a deconstructed burrito minus the rice and wrap.",

What I did not like is we ordered a drink and then an hour later when the table across from us  sat and was eating in like 5 minutes I was wondering what was going on. Finally our waitress came and told us the kitchen pulled our order at the end instead of the beginning. So we waited and hour and 20 mintes to eat, bought more drinks because we were sitting there with a guest. So its was and additonal 40.00 in drinks and the waitness shoudl have compted us the second round of drinks. I really enjoyed the food but the fact that 6 tacos cost me about 100.00 becuase of the 5 drinks is crazy. It took us over 2 hours to eat and we only ate for about 15.00 miniutes.  I really wish the service had been better because it ruined the whole thing for me. Oh I had the salmon tacos and they were very tasty. I just hate having a whole night ruined by bad service...and I had to pay 100.00 for it hummm",

    "text": "This noda staple has a lot of great features and plenty to offer in terms of variety, atmosphere, affordability, etc.  However, I think it may be getting a little played out and my most recent visit was not as impressive as times past.  On a side note, they have this new system where they text you when your table is ready so I thought that was pretty cool...  So, we had a party of 6 this past Friday and for the most part we were seated quickly, treated well and the waitress was very attentive.  I think their service is pretty good overall.  They start you off with a corn salsa in a dish that is so microscopic I could hardly fit my chip in there.  Trying to scoop straight up corn onto a corn chip is just annoying in my opinion.  If it was salsa, WITH corn, then maybe I could get on board but more corn ends up on the table than on your chip or in your mouth.  We ended up ordering some queso and that came out in the same itty bitty dish...but the queso was good.  I don't need to rehash all of the food, the fish tacos, the wraps/burritos, etc...I think everyone knows what they have at this point.  Everything we ordered was \"good.\"  We ordered a couple specials for the night, mahi-mahi fish tacos, grilled shrimp tacos, etc.  Everything seemed fairly fresh but I will say that most of our dishes came out cold/lukewarm.  I ordered the grilled shrimp tacos and they were just a little dry.  It was like eating a piece of lukewarm shrimp wrapped in a piece of bread.  The other ingredients were barely there so it didn't add anything to the overall flavor of the taco.  The refried beans were a bit cold as well.  I know they are super busy so I can't expect perfection but I just think the quality of this place has decreased slightly since my first visit a couple years ago.  It is still an exciting, vibrant place to be and I still felt like I was cool because I was in noda with all the trendy, cool people...but I think the lack of competition in this area is what keeps this restaurant truly hopping.  It is unique but if you put up a couple more restaurants on N. Davidson I don't think Cabo would maintain their hype.  That's just my opinion.",

My personal experience has been that coming on an off peak day or time has made for the best tacos. Friday or Saturday nights can have a wait upwards of an hour but the hostess has always been friendly, either offering a seat at the bar, or taking your number to text you when your table is available. This is super convenient if you want to hit one of the other NoDa bars for a beer before dinner.   On my most recent visit (an early Sunday night, around 6:30), we were seated immediately and had great service. I ordered the Lemon Grilled Shrimp tacos with the Nopolita Salad as my side. We also enjoyed some guac to start. Paired with a local Birdsong Jalapeno Pale Ale, it was a great dinner all around! I'll definitely be back. Also a favorite spot to bring out of town visitors!",

You can make the honey wasabi sauce at home- 1 part honey, 1 part wasabi paste. It really is that easy and has made the lack of Cabo a bit more bearable.",

    "text": "Love me some Cabo!  There are a ton of tacos to choose from and every one I've ever had has been delish. Generally my wife and I get two different ones and share. Today's visit brought us beer battered Tilapia and BBQ Mahi. Most of the tacos come with minced cabbage, tomato, guacamole, cheese, and some yummy, creamy sauce drizzled on. They start you with some corn, tomato and pepper salsa and chips which is not too spicy but is always fresh tasting. Today we augmented with some queso that was hot, cheesy and tasty with a peppery finish.  The atmosphere is funky like most NoDa places and we've always found the service to be fast and friendly. No pretentious hipster vibe here as everyone seems to be deemed cool enough to be treated well by the staff. Always a mix of clientele from the tattooed and pierced to the khaki'd and buttoned down. Nice beer specials too and it was all I could do to lay off the $2 drafts before heading back to cubeville this afternoon!",

Some people are reluctant to try fish tacos but everyone I have brought here has loved it. Not a single complaint. They offer some typical dishes but then also offer some exotic options as well. The sauces they use for the fish are amazing!",

Cabo started in Blacksburg. Anyone else notice the high number of Hokies that live in the Charlotte area?   The inside is really nice. I like the decor. They renovated the building and did a great job. There is a little patio.   I usually get the Lemon Grass Shrimp tacos. I like the mexi-slaw as the side. They have an INCREDIBLE corn chowder- but it isn't always on the menu. Order it if you see it.  My husband loves almost everything on the menu and always raves about it. BTW- this place can get PACKED. This is NOT a smart place to go to with a big group.",

I always chose patio seating instead.  The chips are very thick, it's kind of awkward. The corn salsa is delicious though. My last visit we added the salsa verde and it was so salty we could only have a bite of it.  The tacos are okay, they seem to have lost flavor over time.  Out of previous positive experiences, I'm not going to write Cabo off, but it won't be my first choice.",

That being said, when someone decided we should go to a place that serves fish tacos, I could think of nothing more disgusting. But because I am always willing to try a restaurant's staple dish, I bravely tried a mahi mahi fish taco.  I don't get surprised by non-desert foods a lot, but wow!! I loved it! In fact, for the next several days I actually had fish taco cravings. Since that experience I have been to a few places where they recommended their fish taco, hoping to satisfy the craving I would eat them but they were horrible compared to Cabo Fish Taco.  I have now been back several times and have even guided a few friends into trying a fish taco. I still don't eat seafood but love these fish tacos. The complimentary homemade salsa is really good too.  Word to the wise though, if you have a group bigger than four people, show up really early or plan on a wait. They don't take reservations. And only have a few places that seat bigger parties.",

    "text": "This place use to be on our short list of regular places to visit. The shrimp tacos and mexi-slaw were worth waiting for.  I hadn't been in a few years until yesterday, when I decided I had been going without Cabo for long enough!   It was quite chilly outside, so when the hostess sat us at a table directly in front of the door, I asked that we be moved into the \"bar\" room. She hesitated and said service would take a while if we moved, even though I could see several empty tables. We agreed to stay right in front of the door. It was cold. When other guests walked in they tended to leave the door open, and the hostess was rarely there to close it, so that wasn't very comfy.  The hostess never smiled, and often rolled her eyes at the backs of other guests, and once at a crying baby. That was a turn off. They couldn't see her, but we could.   I got my usual shrimp tacos and slaw. The shells to the tacos had been very lightly fried, but were greasy and tasted of old oil. The slaw has changed. Not as much flavor and the spicy seeds they put on it were missing (that was the best part!)  My son got the $6.96 shrimp burrito from the kids menu. He got a side of Baja Rice. It would have been nice if the server had told us the burrito was already filled with Baja Rice, which was described as having chutney on it, but that must have been missing too. So the not-so-good rice and burrito were left with one bite out of each.   My daughter got the lemon seared shrimp tacos. Basically bait shrimp with lemon seasoning on it. She asked for the fresh fruit option as a side, but they didn't have any, so she got the veggie medley, which I ate. She picked the shrimp out and ate them solo.   My husband got swordfish tacos (maybe burritos?) and mexi-slaw. He LOVED the swordfish, but even as an avid slaw lover (and just all around food lover!), he left his slaw to the trash.    On a side note, our server was nice. The vegetable medley was really tasty, and I wish I would have just gotten a huge bowl of that!   Not sure we will be back, which makes me sad. This was my go-to recommendation for any new comers to Charlotte.",

We enjoyed our wait across the street at Growlers Pourhouse.    Once we were seated, our water and drinks arrived very quickly.  What happened next is still an amazing mystery.  We put in our taco order and no less than five minutes later, it all came out.  It was incredible!  Four of us each ordered a duo of CFT signature tacos.  I had the BBQ Mahi and Lemon Shrimp.  The Lemon Shrimp wins between those two hands down.  It is so light and refreshing and perfectly lemony.  The BBQ Mahi is delicious too but on the heavier side with the creamy BBQ sauce.  And my classic margarita washed it all down wonderfully.",

    "text": "This place is one of the things I miss most about living in North Carolina. I will start out by saying that I am not a big fan of seafood, but I do enjoy a good fish taco. Their Bbq Mahi Tacos are my favorite item on the menu. I've ordered that dish quite a few times and it's never anything less than fantastic. The texture and flavor of the mahi is just perfect and they are very generous with the portion. The dish comes with two tacos, but so much falls out of each taco you almost need a third tortilla to make an extra taco with. I must also suggest the wasabi tuna burritos. There is just something about that wasabi sauce... and the large chunks of tuna, just....delish. The only things that I'd like to see added to the menu are corn tortillas. Flour tortillas are good, and theirs aren't bad, but when it comes to fish tacos I tend to prefer corn. The music volume also tends to be a little on the loud side. When you're already hard of hearing it makes conversation with the other people in your group a bit of a challenge. Other than that, wouldn't change a thing. It's truly a unique restaurant in a trendy setting in Charlotte's art district. When I head back to Charlotte this summer for a visit, this place is on my to-do list.",

Both were extremely good, each with a unique sauce to compliment.  Their side dishes are loaded with flavor and make sure to order one of Charlotte's local brews...they offer several!!

I'd recommend this place to anyone. It does have a tendency to fill up so whether you're doing lunch or dinner you may want to leave a few minutes early.",

    "text": "Yummo. Simple, good, fresh food. The flavors speak for themself- which is good b/c this place is crazy packed so it can be hard to hear what anyone has to say. The beer battered fish tacos are light and remind me of SoCal. Big chunks of flakey, moist white fish cooked to crispy perfection on the outside.  Ask for extra white cilantro sauce, it is just so damn good on everything!   My dining companion, a fellow foodie, did the nirvana eye-roll upon tasting her shrimp tacos. The menu has a great variety but isn't too big; there are just enough choices that everyone should be able to find something to enjoy. I can't wait to try the carne asada. The staff is friendly, laid back and accomodating. I asked for a side of their corn relish (in my opinion it's more a relish than salsa) and was given a large container. SCORE! This stuff alone is worth the visit. It is made in house and it has a sweet undertone that hits the tastebuds in all the right spots. One way I judge a mexican joint by the refried beans and this place has the best I've tasted in a looong time. They make their own, add lotsa of spice and a tiny kick, topped w/a touch of shredded cheddar and oodles of green onions - I could eat a whole bowl w/chips. Dangerous!  We had a 30 minute wait when we arrived on a Friday night around 8:30 so we were encouraged to visit one of two bars or check out the local galleries. We did both and enjoyed both. Had the weather cooperated, I doubt our wait would've been more than 20min as more people could've used the patio. Either way, I will gladly return and wouldn't mind another 30 minute wait. It's worth it.",

The staff is helpful and they will make any dish to your preference: allergic to dairy, no problems; don't like tomatoes, done.  The name gives it away, the fish taco's are pretty darn delicious.  The portion sizes are large and reasonably priced and with $2 longboards & tecates to wash it down, that's a pretty sweet deal.",

I finally discovered they do take out, so we by-passed the hour wait (at 8:30 on Friday night) and ordered food at the bar. We got chips and the amazing tomatillo salsa while we waited, and luckily, by the time the food came out (which wasn't long), two seats opened up at the bar and we got to eat there. And lemme tell you... It was well worth the wait. The beer battered tacos were out of this world. My husband had the mahi, which I liked on its own, but liked my taco more. The avocado pasta salad was the winning side- my black beans and rice were a little bland. But overall, it definitely lived up to the hype!",

It seems like they do some kind of misguided communal attempt at serving here, and then none of the servers communicate with each other so we ended up with multiples of some things and none of others.  Worst of all the servers seemed annoyed with US when we corrected them.    Listen guys, theres a reason that 99% of restaurants have one waiter per table, BECAUSE IT WORKS.  On the brightside, the burrito I had was pretty damn good, so was my girlfriends, though I dont remember which ones they were, the fact that 2 different ones were good leads me to believe they have their burrito game on lock.

We decided to say something since there was obviously something wrong.  Instead of bringing us a new drink they tried to doctor it up.  The waitress said they poured out some of the drink and added more sour mix.  Needless to say, it was horrible.

We actually asked the guy about them b/c we thought they were stale and he let us know that's how they are supposed to be.... they had made a fresh batch about 2 hours ago.

Cabo's perimeters were empty and the streets of Noda were barren. No gallery crawl, so lunch was to be served unadulterated and uninterrupted.   It all started on a sunny Sunday afternoon with amazing weather and a $2 can of Modelo. The service was friendly, the patio was ideal, and the food came out hot and fast.   Chips are no longer cold and instead of the regular fried White fish tacos, I decided to switch it up and opted for the special Tav-ah-roo tacos. The Tuna still wasn't anything special, but the wasabi sauce was pretty fabulous. Blackened tuna tacos were also so/so, along with the sides.   Cabo still hasn't made the upper echelon as far as my personal favorites, but still a very cool spot with decent food and a nice break from the norm.",

I ordered the shrimp & chicken burrito, despite the contents it was pretty dry and lacked seasoning. The chips and pico dip were equally mediocre with what tasted like borderline stale chips. The only reason for three stars is the servers were especially nice and I did enjoy one of the tacos from a previous trip. If I want good tacos, this wouldn't be at the top of my list.",

    "text": "Wish I could rate this 3.5, I realllllly like this place, I always have a good time here as well as good service, and yet when I initially clicked 4 stars it didn't feel right.  I have been here multiple times and have never gotten anything I didn't enjoy.  The tacos are great, the queso and salsa are really good as well, have had good burritos, have had good fish, but I think there is a tad of over-hyped-ness that comes with this place.  It's slightly expensive, but to be honest for well prepared, fresh fish you probably should expect a pricier meal. Most times I have been there is usually a wait BUT there is a bar to belly up to whilst you wait OR you are in NODA and there is plenty to see (shops, art, or ppl watch).  Continuing on the wait, the staff is always hustling and it does create an up-beat environment, and it is a fun place, service is great and waits never seem as long as they say.   My biggest gripe with the place might be the beer selection, I know it is a destination sort of place and you want to make sure you have your BMC's covered, but when you are literally one miles from two awesome breweries offer more than just one option from the two... And $5.50 pints ($5 was the \"special\") C'MON!!!  As a stickler for good beer, and being in this neighborhood, try a little harder!  Now my bashing is over back to positives, they mixed drink selection is pretty good, wife always gets margarita and still hasn't had a repeat flavor as the variety is big.  They don't seem to skimp on the booze and she always says they taste solid.   This and cowfish are also our two favorite places to take friends from out of town looking for something different.  Great place always a good time, enjoy the food, fun, but maybe just a tad over-rated for me.  Will be back, would always recommend",

They give you the option of corn or flour tortillas, I had the flour. The tortillas were slightly grilled or fried - they were in between soft and crunchy and they were fantastic. 2 tacos for about $11, but trust me, they are huge and filling. I can't recommend these tacos enough, and Cabo Fish Taco is on my must visit list from now on when I'm in Charlotte.",

Fish was in chunks, lightly seasoned with cabbage, cheese, guacamole and queso sauce. Tortilla was chewy, but still good and didn't \"dissolve\" after one bite.  Also ordered the guacamole and chips. Homemade and very good, but a little too puree for me as well and would have liked a little more cilantro, but still good. Hard to screw up guacamole.  Ordered a couple of local beers and enjoyed each. Sat at the bar and again, find the best service at the bar.  Small place and packed on a Thursday night. Cool place to check out a \"local\" Charlotte hangout.",

The food was really tasty, Blackened Mahi Taco's with Avocado pasta and Battered Shrimp Taco's with rice. We all had NODA Jam Session draft beer and that was really good as well. We arrived 20 minutes before closing and we're told as we walked in to order quickly and we felt rushed by the staff and especially the waiter. When he brought our beer he told us if we wanted another it was last call, so we asked for one and he told us we had to drink the first before he could bring another - apparently state law.  OK, so why tell us it was last call.  No attention. No care in our food or service.  We'll go back but not within 30 minutes of closing.  We felt rushed and ignored!",

    "text": "Cabo Fish Taco is located in NODA, which is the north end of davidson street.  Everytime we stop by NODA, my bf and I would always see a line out the door.  People were obviously waiting for seats to open up.  We were lucky enough to gone there early on a Wednesday night 6pm, right before my flight to grab an early dinner.  Once we walked in, there were plenty of seats and a reall cool looking booth that can fit up to 10 people.  Would love to sit there, if i were to come with a group of friends.    We were first served chips and salsa! I absolutely love their salsa! It had tomatoes, corn, and pieces of onion.  I guess i love anything that has corn in it!   We both ordered two tacos which comes with a side.  The tacos can mix and match so i got the Beer Battered Fish Taco and the Beer Battered Shrimp Taco with a side of Spicy avacado pasta.  I thought the shrimp taco was more delicious than the fried fish taco.  Reason is because the shrimp was still juicy and chewy even when fried.  I can tell they must of fried the shrimp on the spot, because both the fried fish and the fried shrimp came out pipping hot.  The taco shells were also fried, which was a change in all the tacos i ever had up north.  With every bite, there would a crunchy taste!  I would like to rave about the Spicy Avacado pasta salad! it was definitely delicious!   My bf got the Blackened Mahi Mahi Taco and the Steak taco  with a side of the baha salad?  The side came with black beans, chick peas , and corn i think.  And in our perspective, the side choice wasn't a good one.  However the Blackened Mahi Mahi taco was just okay, and the steak taco was chewy and was cooked to medium well.    Next time i think i would  try the fried shrimp tacos again, and another taco thats not from the fryer to balance out the chew factor taste.",

Located in the cute NoDa district of Charlotte, Cabo Fish Taco has a laid-back, southern Cali vibe with 2 bars tucked inside and outdoor patio seating. There isn't a bad spot in the house. The patio is heated for colder weather.   The food is unreal. When you are seated your server will bring you their house-made salsa and chips. It is so fresh and tasty. I love to try their weekly specials, one of my all-time favorites being the Wahoo taco. Their season jalapeno mashed potatoes are so delicious! This is available in the colder months. We always start with the crab dip appetizer, no one can beat their crab dip.  Staff is friendly, and service is on point. They also have a great drink selection, and a great margarita menu. My favorite being the Azul margarita!",

The combination of the BBQ sauce and spices kept my taste buds working throughout the meal. Refried beans had adequate texture to compliment the Mahi. Service was prompt and attentive to my needs. The Buckshot local draft beer helped top off the meal. I will return to this establishment to get deeper into Cabo's menu.",

I ordered the Cabo roll as my meal and it was delicious, however it is super rich so it's self limiting. One of us got the lemon grilled shrimp tacos with refried beans and the other got the tuna burrito. The refried beans have a strange bright citrus taste to them in my opinion, but they were still decent. Also we got a margherrita but they don't offer them as frozen blended, but it was still good. Overall the food was good, there are a lot of choices, the prices are decent, the parking sucks, I would go back again for sure.",

When I received my fish tacos they looked like what I expected except for one thing. If the fish was breaded at the restaurant then why bother breading fish pieces. The fish itself was fine but I received pieces. Typically, if you cut the fish correctly you won't have pieces. The batter was okay but I've fish sticks for Gorton's that were better. The batter had absolutely no flavor. It just seemed that someone took the time to decorate but I felt that I was served leftovers. I'm going to look somewhere else for fish tacos in the future.  If you ever in San Diego then try Rubio's, which is a fast food fish taco place and they seem to know what to serve the customer and what not to serve the customer. Cabo's didn't feel that way. At I could have received the same dinner for half the price but with a lot more flavor.",

The first time I had something fried with the cilantro white sauce - I thought the sauce was way too much and the fried fish was flavorless - did not ever want to go back. Needless to say, I returned. The salsa is very bland, literally just a little bowl of corn and diced tomatoes? I tried 3 of the tacos on my recent trip - the lemon grilled shrimp easily the best but in the larger scheme of things just average, the bbq mahi tacos ok - a lot of flavor, seemingly none of it fish, and the beer battered shrimp tacos pretty Captain D's-esque. The pecan pie was nice and gooey, but the flavor was a tad too sugary. And the red velvet cake was tasty with a good middle layer, but a strange gelatinous top layer.",

I'm now left wondering just what, exactly, all the fuss IS over.  Cabo has generated a lot of hype, but does not have the substance to back it up.  Given that it was a Saturday night, I assumed there would be a bit of a wait.  We were told we'd have a table in 10 minutes, and the hostess was pretty accurate.  After initially getting our names on the wait list, though, she could have done without immediately telling us we were in her way (in those words, exactly).  We made it to our table, and the waitress promptly greeted us and took our drink orders.  We inquired about the specials on the chalk board, only to find out those were from yesterday and no one got around to updating the sign.  We placed our orders from the regular menu.  And waited.   And waited. And watched other tables, who were seated AFTER us, receive their orders BEFORE us.  Mind you, half the restaurant is still empty.  After 45 minutes of waiting and inattentive service from our waitress, she explained there was a mix up in the kitchen.  She was unable (unwilling?) to compensate us in any way for such poor service.  The food finally arrived and I was unimpressed.  It tasted good, but not Food Network, everyone's-talking-about-it good.  The tacos were more lettuce than fish and the slaw was rather bland.  When you add it all up, and factor in the fact that the place is so loud it's impossible to do more than look at the other people at your table, I felt like I had wasted my money and the better part of my evening on a miserable experience.  Needless to say, I won't be giving Cabo a second chance.",

    "text": "I've never been to Cabo, and I don't like fish tacos. I also don't like paying to park in dodgy gravel lots. However, I do like parking for free about a block down from NoDa's Cabo Fish Taco. There I might see a man in the yard adjacent to my meterless spot, expertly swinging chains with fiery balls attached to the ends. That he was performing for the group of firemen encircling him made it seem somehow normal.  You just never know what you are going to get in NoDa. You do, however, know what you are going to get at Cabo Fish Taco.  Usually, you'll get a waiting list. They've expanded into the space next door, where the hardwood planks are far less buoyant than those on the original side, and added covered outdoor seating. Their popularity has grown as well, so the extra room is proportionate to the demand. They don't take reservations, and at lunch and  even on weeknights there's sometimes a short wait, so it's best to plan accordingly.  You'll always get complimentary salsa. Not the liquefied tomato version of most Tex-Mex eateries, but Cabo Fish Taco's primarily corn, tomato and black bean brand that always has a few rebellious members who refuse to stay in the bowl or on a chip.  Fresh food is de rigueur at Cabo Fish Taco, along with special twists of white cilantro sauce and Napolito Salad. That's cactus, to the gringos. For those of us who don't care for fish, the menu also includes salads, burritos, tacos, quesadillas and my favorite, the Serrano Chicken Salad with a side of Mexi-Slaw, all sans fins.  Perhaps as a nod to the weird, or to the sense of community in NoDa, there are two toilets in the ladies room, but no stalls. I'd bet cash money that women with no previous interactions except simultaneously full bladders have used those potties in tandem based on their consumption of Purple Haze Margaritas.  Casual, and generally quick service is expected at Cabo Fish Taco, where the vibe is decidedly NoDa and what I expect of Cabo San Lucas: Anything goes, as long as it is good.",

Saved the other half for Monday's lunch.  The mashers were happily recommended by our server, yet they were lacking seasoning. Hats off to Cabo for my being able to tell they were homemade ( or in disguise)mashed potatoes.  Bf and I also tried Azula Rita margaritas. Margaritas range from $5 to $12 and are $1 off on Sundays. It consists of OJ, pineapple juice, Blue Curacao and Jose C. Pretty tasty and bf ordered a second. ;)  Service was just ok and there was a not big crowd. Will be back to try some of the other menu offerings.",

And even the forgettable ones are okay as repeats if I'm really in the mood for fish tacos. But the Cabo tacos are just in a whole nother level of bad. The mahi mahi was so overcooked and dried out I could barely press my fork though it. Eating it felt like chewing through paper. The coleslaw was totally boring. And the cilantro cream was \"meh.\"   I also ordered the nopalito salad which was unexceptional (more like a chickpea salad). The chips were stale. The salsa was extremely bland.   Yes, I'm from California where you can find the absolute best tacos, so I have to admit that small bias. HOWEVER the carelessness and uninventiveness with which Cabo is approaching their staple meal is unacceptable.  I just read in another review that the Food Network came here. What?!",

Then we split the shrimp tacos with avacado pasta salad..FYI if you can't handle spice like me, they can take the spice out of the pasta salad. Pasta salad was great and the tacos were even better.

Fortunately, you can put your name in with the host and they'll text you when your table is ready.  While waiting,  grab a drink at one of the nearby bars or browse in the stores across the street.  If there's only 2 of you, take a look at the bar - you may be able to get a seat there.  There's a second bar in the room to the right - don't forget to look there!  Once seated, you'll be greeted with a basket of chips and a bowl of corn salsa.  If you don't care for corn salsa (though, it's d-lish), you can ask for another type of salsa.  Their guacamole is fresh and very tasty.  You also won't be disappointed with shrimp and crab dip - creamy, cheesy, seafood goodness.   My absolute favorite item on the menu is the Tavarua tuna tacos.  You get large pieces of perfectly cooked (medium rare) tuna topped with an amazing honey wasabi sauce - think sweet and spicy.  I also really like the salmon guacamole salad - they will cook the salmon how you like - rare for me - and it's done to perfection!    Whenever we have guests in town, I love to come here. There's something for everyone, but it's still unique and memorable.",

I remember it being so much better than my recent visit.  This visit was a disappointment. The best thing about the visit was the jalapeno margarita but I think you can find better ones of those elsewhere in Charlotte.  Like most mexican or tex/mex places we were given the complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were stale so I wasn't really interested in dipping them in the corn salsa.  I ordered the Tavarua Tuna tacos with a side of their mashed potatoes mixed with jalapenos. The tuna and sauce were good. The rest of it was meh. The tortilla shell was rubbery. The mashed potatoes were only partially cooked and I've had better mashed potatoes at a 24 hour diner. My friend ordered the chicken quesadilla in which she offered me a taste and I thought it was quite bland.  I remember Cabo being so much better than this. I guess the appearance on Triple D went to their heads or something like that.",

    "text": "We were visiting Charlotte from out of town and came to Cabo on Saturday night for dinner... they quoted us a 30-45 min wait, so we went across the street and grabbed a beer. And they called us right away to get seated! So our wait was really only 5 min... but we weren't ready to sacrifice our beers - Cabo was understanding and put us at the top of the list when we finished and came back. Inside is loud, and they were busy! There were big groups there, and mostly younger people/couples but also families.   Ok no beating around the bush: THE CRAB DIP! We all agreed that this hands down was the best dish we had all weekend. The warm semi-soft/semi-fried pita chips were so perfect and the dip was so tasty! We were still talking about this days later. The chips were so so good and come with a corn pico. I was honestly full before dinner. Margaritas were tasty, not all that strong though.   I think our server forgot about us or forgot to put our order in because we waited an uncomfortable amount of time before our food came out. My friend (Charlotte resident) said food is usually super quick to come out! So our service was a little disappointing.   I ordered the fried fish tacos Because the restaurant is called Cabo Fish Taco so how could I NOT order a fish taco! Crispy and HUGE! I had to take a whole taco and most of my side home. I had the avocado pasta salad, which was decent. I don't really think it's \"spicy\" as it's named. There were just large chunks of jalapenos that gave it a kick but 95% of it was just a regular pasta salad! People on Yelp seem to love it but it was pretty ordinary to me! My date and friend loved their steak tacos! Definitely a good value for the quality/quantity of food that you get!",

Their teriyaki-kiwi tofu is AMAZING. I was really blown away. It's a very unique flavor that they pull off marvelously.   A waiter will immediately bring your table chips and salsa - but be aware it's corn salsa and it's messy to eat and not particularly flavorful. I wish their fajitas came with avocado/guacamole, but that may be a personal preference. I also had a \"skinny\" margarita and it was the perfect balance of alcohol and lime and whatever else they throw in there. I'll be back soon!",

We were fortunate to have only a short wait, and even got a parking space right in front!   Loved the vibe of the place, reminded me of my old town Berkeley. A hipster joint and friendly crowd! My spouse had the fish tacos and I had the beer battered white fish tacos. Both were superb. I paired my white fish tacos with a nice local serving of Triple C Brewing 3C IPA, given by our hostess' recommendation. Stupendous.  Menu is extensive.

I say this, and I really want to like this place, but honestly, most of their food is lackluster, bland (or way too spicy/overseasoned) or greasy. Maybe I just haven't had good meals here, but no one in our party was blown away by the food...except the seafood dip and guac, those were both on point!   I ordered the battered fish and shrimp tacos (one of each), with a side of rice and beans. My shell was so greasy that it was almost translucent and all the shrimp and veggies fell right out of it. I spent more time wiping my hands than I did enjoying the taco. The shrimp itself was delicious, but nearly impossible to eat in taco form. The fish, on the other hand, spent a little too long in the fryer, and honestly, just tasted like oil. I didn't even finish that taco. My rice in my rice and beans was still crunchy and other friends at the table had the same complaint. The avocado pasta salad, was spicy, but flavorful, so that was a bonus. Drink wise, stick to beer, as everyone at our table felt the margaritas were heavy on the sour mix, rather than a balanced margarita. Overall, I've given this place three chances since moving to Charlotte, and I think it's three strikes, you're out. Sorry Cabo, but I'll be taking my taco cravings elsewhere.",

Plus, it's in the great Noda neighborhood, where the whole street is filled with great restaurants and bars you can hop in and out of.  The menu is very varied, and offers a mix of Mexican cuisine as well, with their infamous fish tacos. Very eclectic menu and atmosphere overall and great for groups. Their bbq mahi mahi fish tacos are probably my favorite dish (I usually always order fish) and their salmon comes very well-flavored as well.   The salsa that comes with the chips is very good and addicting, with their pico de gallo/corn mixture. I always get seconds and thirds. They also have a lengthy margarita list, if you are a tequila lover, which I assume you are if you are contemplating Cabo. !  Great spot for groups, beer drinking, or margarita drinking",

Landed at the bar because it's just easier that way; fish tacos plus black beans, rice and an iced beverage for a happily diverse luncheon... Start with too many chips and dish of corned salsa to make my meal seem more substantial. Chips are standard fare but crunchy so close enough (because it's not Cabo Chips.) corn salsa has a little bit of \"howdy!\" and I like it okay even though it tends to fall off the chips. Fish tacos were delightful and well mannered alongside the beans and rices; a fine example of peaceful coexistence in troublesome times. Can't really complain about crispy breaded whitefish chunks and all that vegetative stuff with a decorative swoosh of sauceage: just fishy enough to know it used to was a fish not a chicken. Black beans are hard to wreck and pair nicely with the rice; I'd prefer a pinch of cajun spice in the beanery but when that's my biggest problem in life we're looking pretty sharp.",

Just order the BBQ Mahi-Mahi or the Beer Battered shrimp tacos, simply awesome. I tried the new Soy Ginger shrimp tacos and it was one of the best things I have ordered in this city. Oozing with flavor, I was licking my hand not to waste a drop. Haha, questionable. So a tip of the cap to Cabo, cheers my friends. Shout out to waitress who was boasting six tables on the patio.",

Not-so-fresh (brown), tasteless mashed avocado in one small dish with pickled relish (huh?) onion and tomato in two others. So 1/3rd avocado that tasted bad to begin with. Would have sent it back but we were lucky to get it since it was so busy, Our meal took over 30 minutes to arrive, it was busy but that is still too long. The bbq mahi tacos had good fish, but were very spicy, and the tortillas a bit greasy. The rice and beans were soggy. Shrimp tacos were OK. Our waiter gave us our check before asking, so if there is dessert at the restaurant, we have no idea. I know this place is popular, but we will go elsewhere for Mexican. The city has no shortage.",

It was not crowded and we were taken to our seats right away, but the full party did not want to sit outside. In most situations the hostess ask if you would like to dine in or outside. We told her that we wanted a seat in the inside, the hostess said it would be 20 mins. We didn't wait that long. The lady came and brought us chips with corn salsa. I asked for verde and they stated it was a charge. She did say that the regular salsa was no charge. The chips seemed dry with no flavor and so did the sauces. I ended up ordering the crab and shrimp dip, which was amazing. Our waiter was great and knowledgeable about the menu. I ended up ordering the chicken and shrimp burrito, which was supposed to have a white cilantro sauce with the mexican slaw. I don't remember tasting a lot of cilantro. The meal left me feeling like it was ok, which was not my norm with Cabo.",

As a warning sometimes the wait can be really long because this is a popular spot.   When you are seated chips and corn salsa is brought out to the table.  They are both really good.  I ordered the lemon tuna tacos based on the waitresses suggestion and they were incredible.  I didn't eat my side because I was full off of the delicious tacos.  As a warning the shells are fried but they are delicious.  My husband got the blackened mahi and chicken corn tacos, and really enjoyed them!",

    "text": "I can't say enough good things about this place. My dad has worked in NoDa since I was little, and I'm glad to say Cabo Fish Taco has stayed as popular as it has. Whenever I'm home from college or in the area to visit family, CFT is my go-to place for eating out. It was first on my list of restaurant bars to hit when I celebrated turning 21, so I immediately ordered one of the azularitas, made with Sauza extra-gold tequila, Curacao liquer, pineapple juice, and the house marg mix...SO good (and it's blue, so double the fun).  Without fail I order the grilled steak signature tacos. The cabbage is an excellent addition that Cabo adds to their tacos that not many other places do; it's extra crispy and refreshing with the steak and cheese, plus the Cabo tortillas are unlike any other I've had- they're crisp and golden, but don't fall apart when you pick up your food. The baja rice is the perfect pairing with the tacos, and it comes with a delicious addition of mango-esque sauce on the top that prefects the sweet-and salty flavor of the rice.  They've got great corn and tomato-based salsa I blow through in minutes and have to order refills of every time (good thing it's free), plus great Dia de los Muertos-inspired art in their outside seating area and unbeatable service. They're packed almost all the time, but the wait time is never long and there are great little shops all around the street to look in while you wait, and parking is easy to find all up and down the street or in cheap lots tucked away behind some of the other restaurants.  I've been here at least 15 times and have never experienced anything short of greatness here. Hands-down my favorite Tex-Mex joint in the Queen City area.",

As soon as you walk in, you'll see it may seem small but it's actually pretty spacious and has a great atmosphere. When i sat down, i was immediately given chips and corn salsa - YUM! the chips tasted fresh and the salsa was sweet and had a kick. I ordered the queso dip - which I normally don't order when i go to get mexican food, but this one was really good. I also ordered the blackened mahi tacos. OH..MY..GOD, the tacos...they were amazing. the fish was cooked perfectly, tender and flaky-not dry, and the seasoning was perfect! I ordered a side of the mexi-slaw which was surprising amazing too. And i couldn't go without ordering a pomegranate margarita, AMAZING! This will definitely be my go-to spot whenever I come to Charlotte!",

    "text": "Why are there not 6 stars available?????? During my years on this earth never before have I eaten such blissful food served by a thoughtful waitress by the name of Stephanie. I came here for lunch on a Wednesday since I've been craving some fish tacos and I'm so glad I did. Even for lunch, Cabo Fish Taco was fairly crowded, I didn't expect that at all. I thought we'd be the only table there. We found 2 seats close to the bar quickly though, and didn't have to wait.   I'm fairly adventurous and asked our waitress Stephanie to order me something excellent that would make me want to return for more and wow did she deliver.Our order was taken promptly and we waited about 10 minutes to get our tacos. I was blessed with the combo tacos containing Blackened lemon rubbed tuna in a kiwi-pineapple fajita sauce, stuffed with lettuce, tomato, mixed cheeses, & topped with their honey wasabi sauce as the first taco I devoured nearly biting the end of my index finger off ensuring one drop would not hit the plate. As for my second taco I was equally impressed with the Grilled mango BBQ Mahi-Mahi tacos stuffed with Cabo slaw, tomato, avocado, mixed cheeses & finished with their cilantro white sauce. For the price, the tacos are gigantic!  The tacos were delicious and cooked to perfection, the flavors of the fish blended very well with the salsa and white sauce. The mahi was grilled just right, and the fish meat just flaked right off with each bite. The tuna taco was nothing short of amazing and am at a lost for words to describe articulately how your taste buds will feel after this delight.  Its not often I run into servers that take guests comfort and needs as serious and personal as our waitress Stephanie and is a real gem for this establishment. I happened to meet their General Manager Chris and again a real class act. Its apparent to me that this place has extremely high standards in both selecting employees and the food they offer to their patrons. I will most definitely be returning at my earliest opportunity.  The music may have been a tad on the loud side for casual conversation, but then again I'm getting a little older and this may just be me. (nothing that would prevent me from returning to this Charlotte jewel!)   HOORAY Cabo Fish Taco you have won my heart!!!!!!!  Note: they DO take credit cards.",

We have friends that have been to 35 Triple D's (Diners, Drive Ins and Dives) and this is their fave and I know why! We started well I started with an Azure Margarita \"Blue\" and it's the best Rita I have ever had! So smooth that I ordered a second one but this time pomegranate. They bring chips and a corn salsa to the table which is really good and light! We both ordered the 2 taco combo plate and they let you mix and match. My husband ordered shrimp and the lemon tuna and I got the steak and white fish. We both agreed that the white fish was the best. It was beer battered with like a tempura batter. Omg it was amazing! The shrimp had the same type batter! The steak was just ok..a bit tough. The tuna was fresh and flavorful!!! It was just good food! The taco shells are fried but soft not crunchy! This place is amazing!!!!",

It's loud, it's a place to say you went. The shrimp tacos are pretty good, but it's hard to screw up fried food.",

I (did) love cabo fish taco but last night was a really bad experience. My friend got there minutes before me (so a table for two) and they refused to sit her. It was a weeknight (a Wednesday) at 7pm.  I got there and she told the hostess that we were both there and she then told us we would have to wait. Mind you, there wasn't a wait when my friend got there. So, we had to wait even more. They got our name and phone number.  10-15min later, they texted us so we came to the door. The hostess ignored us as her and her coworker were telling a patron about seating options for a large party. She looked at my friend (who she has now seen 3-4 times) with the look of \"what are you doing here?\" I've never seen such  a horrible waitress before.  Also, the salads are horrible. I got the tuna one and it was gross. Not worth the $12. Just stick with a margarita and queso.",

I was expecting fish tasting taco but it was the least fish tasting tuna I've ever had. The fish was cut into chunky cubes but cooked so the meat practically melted into your mouth. The best part was the tortilla.  The tortilla was made out of some sort of God-Bread that was both flaky and bready at the same time. It was almost pastry like and I need to know how to make it!   But anyways. You get my drift. Awesome, awesome, awesome food.",

The food was delish and sooo good. The salsa was so flavorful, it honestly tasted like they just prepared it before they brought it to the table. The chips were perfectly salted and so crispie and crunchie! Sooo good.  My 2 year old nephew was with us this day and he loved the food and also the MUSIC! He was partying and jamming out to some reggae songs while we ate. Got some cute videos of him. Soooo...if your 2 year old nephew is smiling and jaming out and snacking on chips, salsa, fish tacos and the alike, this place has got to be good!  4 adults, 1 child, and bill was around 60 bucks or so. Not terrible. We were stuffed and by the time we went to leave -- the entire place was packed and there was a line at the door!  This is saying something for a Sunday at 12 noon !  Check this place out - you will be glad you did! Oh yummm dude!",

I got the refried beans before and they are a meh.  The cheese dip is very good.  We ordered the guacamole today and we were not fans of it.  My husband ordered the bbq mahi mahi tacos and loved them but he found a fish bone in it..and he also found something mysterious and hard in his refried beans (it looked like a fish bone but I don't know how it would have ended up in refried beans!).  Also tried the tomatillo salsa the first time we went and it was horrible..the whole table couldn't eat it.  The corn salsa they bring out with the chips is alright.  Basically a lot of hits and misses but the main attraction (the fish tacos) are very good.  I'm just a little turned off by the fish bone and more so the mysterious hard thing in my husbands refried beans. I think I may stick with the fish tacos at Phat Burrito. They put mango salsa on it and also have a fresh salsa bar with at least 6 or 7 different salsas on it.",

The server was way too laid back and paid no attention to us at all. The chips and salsa are bland - ordered some cheese dip to kick it up, and the cheese dip was just hard, melted velveeta. We ordered the steak and fish tacos. Both were mediocre, at best. I had the mexi slaw, which was nothing to write home about and my husband had the jalepeno-chedder mashed potatoes which were cold and just plain awful. Our beers were VERY over priced as well. Overall, I will never go back there again. It's a shame, because a few years ago, I remember it tasting much better. Perhaps being on a food network show got to their heads because the quality has gone WAY downhill. Ugh.",

My once favorite shrimp tacos are made up of overcooked shrimp and a greasy a tortilla shell.

But even though some previous reviewers might disagree with me, I thought that service was reasonably fast once we were inside.    Food was average.  As a vegetarian, I can't have their signature item, so no tacos pour moi, but I still judge places on their veg items.  And what I had wasn't bad at all, it was sort of a grilled California burrito with queso (Burrito Verde).  It was big and I took home a good bit of it.  Had a side of Jalapeno and Cheese Mashers, which was fairly bland.  But prices were fine.  Small but decent selection of beers on tap (Dogfish, etc. when I was there).  Overall, I would probably give this place a 2.5.  Though the food isn't great, they don't forget about the vegetarian.  And the wait should be expected.  But its just so LOUD!!!  Have to deduct some points for that.  If I wait, and deal with noise, and then the food is amazing, then its worth the trouble.  But though good, the food here just doesn't justify dealing with waiting/atmosphere.",

But I was working from home on Fri and some former co-workers were heading there so I decided to suck it up and meet them.  It was packed at 12:15 and even though the 3 others were there they wouldn't seat them until I arrived.  Seemed odd for a place like that but okay.  When our waitress came by she was very abrupt with us and kind of slapped the menus on the table.  Someone else came by and threw the chips and salsa down.  My main complaint with this place is the chips suck, like seriously w/o fail everytime I go there they taste stale and cold.  Do they keep them in a fridge??  Not good.  We split the crab and shrimp dip appetizer, it was good and they pita crisps they give you tasted fresh.  I had the shrimp tacos w/no cilantro sauce because cilantro  makes me gag!  I was offered some honey wasabi sauce and I accepted but never received it.  Oh well, the tacos were actually pretty yummy on their own.  I got a side of the fruit but didn't eat it because it looks like it was really old and had a congealed look about it, no thanks.  Even though the food was good, I still just can't really get into this place, the service, the bad chips, in the past really bad margarita's.  I would much rather hit up Revolution or Solstice if I choose to eat out around home.",

    "text": "Cabo Fish Taco is one of the most hoppin' restaurants in Charlotte and for good reason:  tasty fresh Cali-Mex (or Baja) food, cool ambience, fresh salsa, and its proximity to all the hightlife joints in NoDa.  However, the place is somewhat \"tainted\" by their reputation.  I've never been when it wasn't packed and the servers weren't rushing us to order.  Dont' get me wrong-I still highly recommend that people try Cabo.  Just try it out for lunch or whenever the gallery crawls in NoDa are not taking place.  I've had the taco salad with chicken and on another occasion, carne asada tacos-both of which were slammin'!  The carne asada tacos uses chunks of well seasoned meat-with onion, cilantro, and romaine lettuce.  I was exceedingly full after eating just two of them.  The salad screamed freshness as well; chunks of real chicken, romaine lettuce, and other fresh veggies and cheeses.  Mmm mmm!    if you dare go on a weekend night, please be gracious to the wait staff.  They work pretty hard and brought our food in a timely fashion despite the crowds.  If I could offer any suggestions to Cabo, I would tell them hire more wait staff for the weekends.  The service doesn't quite match the quality of food.  Perhaps they could open up the upstairs for dining as well.  Overall, I'm pleased to have a restaurant like this in CLT.",

    "text": "I had my first fish taco when I was 18. That's way too long to live without knowing how great of an idea that is. Beer-battered fish has been a part of my life since the fish fries I went to as a kid, and taco night was always a DIY-adventure. So the two together can be pretty awesome. Or, like many things in NoDa, they can be trendy (and a bit pricey). Cabo Fish Taco's namesake is pretty good. They're not anything to sell my possessions for a surfboard over, but because I can't surf in Charlotte, I wouldn't do that anyway. I like the salsa blanca and how delicate yet filling these tacos are. Their queso takes a good hint of chipotle and is an excellent appetizer choice. Above all else, try the Mexi-Slaw, a chopped vegetable side that I like more than the traditional cole slaw. Since the place is trendy, one of the hot spots in NoDa, the way is long. Very long. It's relieving to be finally seated, but the place is so bumping that it's hard to really get anyone's attention. Once a server comes over, they're more than happy to help though. The scene's one thing, the food of the sea is another, and that's why I like Cabo Fish Taco but don't always want to go.",

I have been a frequent visitor of the location in Blacksburg, VA and upon moving to Charlotte I was super eager to give this one a try as well. They have a slightly different menu but for the most part it's the same. I tried their sweet chili tofu tacos which was something new to me and they were amazing. I am usually not a huge fan of tofu but these were delicious and the sauce was sweet with a hint of spice but nothing overwhelming. My bbq mahi tacos were actually a spicier than the tofu. I always like to get their margaritas as they are delicious and they have a wide selection. There is normally a wait but the restaurant is a decent size and you usually don't wait as long as they say. Plus, it's totally worth it.",

(disclaimer: my first fish tacos were eaten in Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico...most wonderful thing ever.)  We went with a group, 6 in all, on Saturday. We arrived about 2:20. Sat, ordered drinks and crab dip. Enjoyed drinks and crab dip, and ordered food, only 5 of us ordered food, all tacos.  then we waited...and waited  .......and waited  ....................still waited.  About an hour after we ordered the waitress said our food would be ready soon.  30 minutes later we asked her again.  It was ANOTHER FULL 30 MINUTES before food arrived, cold and awful.  They said that their computer system was broken, but somehow they were able to fill every other table's order. We saw others seated, fed, and gone.  And the food...cold, how do you cook something at the last minute, but deliver it cold? Our mashed potatoes wouldn't even melt the cheese. The tacos were just...just...there aren't words for how much it sucked.  We were in the restaurant until 5:00. Now, I'm all for leisurely eating...but not for this.  They did discount our food, but that wasn't the point really. We would have been more than happy to pay full price for a decent edible meal.",

Our waiter never let our glasses get low but didn't hover. He was very kind to our 2children and treated everyone with upmost respect. I would give Cano 7 of 5 stars if I could. This was many of our parties first visit but you can be sure we will return every chance we get. Their creative,relaxing, decor and attention to detail is a True gift to NoDa and great reason to visit this part of Charlotte. I can't wait to visit other businesses in this part of town. CUDOS",

    "text": "Hmmm... I wanted to like Cabo so much! But sadly, my sister and I's visit on Friday night fell short from the get go, but wasn't a Pompei-esque meltdown either.  I believe the sour taste started as we waited about 2-3 minutes for anyone to notice us standing at the \"wait to be seated\" sign, despite the place being 3/4 empty.   When we got seated, it was obvious our poor waitress was having an off night for whatever reason, but she dropped some chips and \"salsa?\" with us, and took our orders in a decent time frame so all was well with me. Now the \"salsa\" is DUMB. Lacking in flavor, tomatoes and spice, this is basically a cup of corn with a few diced tomatoes and some parsley on top. At least that's what it tasted like. Seriously, bring me some damn salsa, none of this corny junk. Turns out though, if you want some salsa, cough up $3.95 and expect it to be green. :'( Not cool, IMO!  I got the BBQ Mahi Mahi tacos and it was moist and a good portion, but the white sauce everyone is commenting left me asking \"where is it?\". I mean, it was definitely on there but I couldn't taste a thing. Sad day. My sister chose the steak wrap and she didn't say a word from first bite to last and that says it all! :D  As sides, she got black beans and rice which she didn't eat much of, and I tried the jalepeno mashers which are basically chunky mashed potatoes with diced jalepenos and unmelted cheese on top. Weak attempt at a side, guys. Get with it.  For $20, it was ok but I won't be rushing back soon.",

If you want to know if they play up to the hype then just look outside literally any night and you'll see groups of people waiting to grab a table.   Their taco game is on point here ... notice the name. You can't go wrong ordering them. Just two tacos with a side will probably fill you up! I've been branching out and trying new things recently like their burrito which was great!   Prices aren't bad and they have good beer specials too! Don't hesitate to ask your wait staff for suggestions!   Setting reservations for weekends is probably your best bet but during the week I wouldn't expect a huge wait if it's less than 4 people. They have a solid amount of indoor seating and probably about 8 tables on their street side patio. Perfect way to start a night in NoDa!",

I was interested in the tacos since I hear they're famous for them :-) Best part about their tacos is you can mix & match any two, which is great for someone like me were its hard to decide between two!   I ended up getting one of the salmon tacos & one of the tuna. I can't stop raving about how great they were! From the taco shell to the seasoning to the delicious meat inside, everything was excellent. You can also choose one side & I got the spicy avocado pasta salad... I was curious with this one, but once again did not disappoint!   I highly recommend this place and its conveniently located next to other fun pastry shops & bars. For parking, you're looking at street parking or there is a lot in the far back that you can pay the meter.",

First off, the complimentary chips and salsa were very good. The chips were fresh and seasoned well. The fresh corn salsa/pico had a lot of corn and had a nice crunch to it; it's different from your typical tomato based salsa.   For my entree, I ordered the speciality ahi tuna and teriyaki salmon tacos with Mexican cole slaw. Both tacos were fantastic. The tortilla was lightly fried and was a little bit greasy, but hot and had a slight crunch. There was a very generous amount of fish chunks, and they tasted really fresh. The ahi tuna had a nice sear and was rare on the inside, which is a must. The light sauce and wasabi complimented the tuba very well and made it a great taco to eat. The teriyaki salmon was also super flavorful and a great Japanese taste to it. The tacos with the slaw and chips were filling and great to eat.   Overall, I would highly recommend Cabo as a great lunch spot because it's not as busy as dinner. The fish tacos were excellent and a must try. The fish tasted fresh and were served in huge chunks. I would definitely come back next time I'm in Charlotte.",

    "text": "I just got home and began having severe stomach cramps. Now I'm having so much diarrhea and have broken into a sweat over my entire body. I think the fish taco was old and spoiled. UPDATE: My mom also tasted some of my beer battered white fish taco. I asked her to bc it was bland and not at all crispy. She thought it tasted ok but not very good. This morning, she informed me that she TOO had diarrhea all-night long. I got little sleep as one does in these horrific situations. However, there is good news to this story I'm on a diet and want to lose 20 lbs. Because of all the bodily fluids lost , I weighed this morning and was DOWN 1.5 LBS !! THANK YOU CABO for helping me get closer to my target weight!! You guys are the best . Maybe I should come to Cabo every week. HERE'S WHAT I EXPERIENCED: food was subpar and not worth the price. This place is militant when it comes to the subject of straws. They do not and will not have plastic straws ever. On a chalkboard inside the restaurant there is a hashtag that literally says , #nostraws (I didn't see that until way after our encounter). If you ask for a straw- the server jumps on their soap box about plastic and its' evil ways. I'm an environmentalist and know it's an issue. However, the LAST THING I want to happen when I'm dining out at a very expensive restaurant with people who are close to me and others I want to impress is a waiter / waitress making me feel guilty and belittling me because I have a sensitivity to ice and need a straw. THE GROSS PART: I stood my ground and still asked for a straw. The server smirked at our table and handed us recycled plastic straws with no covering. I envisioned so many hands def. not all clean touching all parts of the straw before i sucked on it. I had no choice but to use it (sensitive teeth). I had to accept it. I'm 10000 percent sure that it's not sanitary . I don't think that would pass inspection either. Myself and my entire table (4 people total) were all so disappointed. I felt awful because I was the one who picked out Cabo due to the positive reviews. When we left at 6pm - the entire restaurant was full. I'm confused about the popularity. It's really strange. I want to forget the whole ordeal forever.",

And, after returning this year, I can clearly say I am not missing out on anything. Cabo Fish Taco is just okay...just don't get what all the hype is about. We arrived shortly after 7 on a Monday night and did not have a wait, which was great. We were seated in the new addition of the restaurant (which may not be so new, but since the last time I was there). It is definitely a great addition to the location, very open with a full bar and multiple tables. Monday nights they offer a Margaritaville Margarita for $5.00 so we started with those and were brought chips and salsa, which is corn and tomatoes.  This is the one thing I remember people love about Cabo, not me. It is okay, but no flavor. Needs a little salt. And the chips, they are chips. Not hot, don't seem fresh and need salt.  I ordered the Chicken Quesadillas with a side a refried beans. The quesadillas were good, grilled perfectly with melted cheese, chicken and peppers and onions. The peppers and onions definitely could have been cooked more. As for the beans, blah. Wouldn't bother with those again. My friend ordered the Tavarua Tacos and was not impressed. He also ordered the jalepeno mashed potatoes which sounded really good but said they were nothing great.  So, I remember why I hadn't rushed back and don't anticipate going back anytime soon. However, I thought our server was very sweet and definitely thought her service and the timing of drinks/food service deserved three stars.",

As recommendations if you live outside of uptown, do yourself a favor park near the light rail and take the train up and get off at 36th Street Station and walk a few blocks up, that way you do not have to worry about traffic, parking or anything else. When you finish walk down a few blocks to heist Brewery and sit and relax. ENJOY!",

The chips and corn salsa is always a crowd pleaser and I washed that down with a nice Dos Equis Amber! . . Then it was showtime and I ordered some beer battered Soy ginger shrimp tacos with jalapeno mash potatoes, and wow! As soon as I bit into these tacos the flavor just exploded and the shrimp was so perfectly cooked and tasted delicious.  . Cabo always delivers great service and is quick witj getting the food out, plenty of room and also a great view of the noda area! Go check them out!",

Once again, coming from San Diego, I am still looking for a really good Mexican restaurant in the Charlotte area.   We arrived for a late lunch.  It was busy but not super packed.  Service started on the slow side.  We waited a while for the chips and salsa and drinks.  They delivered their corn salsa and chips.  I like corn salsa.  This one was ok, not spicy and not enough flavor.  My husband asked for regular salsa.  That actually had more flavor and spices.  I preferred the regular salsa.  The chips were on the stale side.   I ordered 2 tacos, a bbq mahi and a soy ginger shrimp.  The mahi was ok, it had a weird flavor and maybe were cut too big for a taco.  The soy ginger shrimp was good.  It had good flavor and would have tasted good with some steamed rice.  The tortillas were on the dry side so I skipped those.  I ordered rice and black beans for my side.  The beans were good, but the rice was bland.  My husband had the ahi and the beer battered shrimp.  He liked both minus the hard tortillas.   Service was fine after the slow start.",

The place is located on a busy street where parallel parking is a necessity if you want to dine. The ambiance had a \"chill vibe\" boasting Bob Marley music and service people in casual wear. The menu was overwhelming and everything looked delicious.   TBH, I am hesitant about fish and fish tacos, but my waitress encouraged me to try one. I ordered the honey soy glazed salmon taco with a carne asada taco. It was perfect! My friend ordered the BBQ mahi mahi tacos, which she always orders, and I tried it. Great choice.  Our sides were avocado pasta salad and jalapeno mashed potatoes. 10/10 would recommend.   You must order the delicious crab dip. It is hot, cheesy, delicious, and served with warm Parmesan crusted pita bread slices.   Lastly, I ordered the pomegranate margarita. Great, but unsure if worth $9.   Service was fantastic. Our waitress was honest, attentive, and personable.",

BBQ Mahi-Mahi Tacos- lots of flavor, was a bit nervous about BBQ fish but loved it Tavarua Tuna Tacos- super fresh and light  I would probably order the same thing again if I ever went back because it was such a good balance. All of it was delicious!  The only bad thing thing I will say is about the avocado pasta salad... that just should not exist. Please do not order it.",

I went for the mahi tacos blackened with a side of the jalapeno mashed potatoes. Waitress brought us some corn salsa with amazing homemade tortilla chips. Corn salsa isn't my thing but still tasty with a bite.  The tacos came out and were filled generously and seasoned amazingly (that's a lot of adverbs). Tacos were amazing and filling. Potatoes not bad but tasted like instant but I actually love instant potatoes.   We also got a guacamole app which was fair but I'd skip the next time.  The star was the tacos and therefore, so good they earn the 5 star rating. Don't miss this place.  This is a bit off the beat and path but easy trip from light rail or a quick Uber.",

The tacos were amazing, not one complaint, and they even let you mix and match different tacos.   Staff:  Very friendly, we sat down right away. Our waiter knew everything about the food and answered every question. He even told us the hot spots in town and gave us some ideas for bars and such.

While it may not be exactly like food served in Baja, the food is still good.   My long-time favorite menu item is the crab dip. It's hot, full of cream cheese, flavor and crab. It comes with pita points, and it is a large appetizer so there's no need to order more than one for your table .   Without ordering you get a really great fresh salsa , with plenty of corn and fresh tomatoes and herbs.   I've also ordered the beer-battered fish tacos, as well as shrimp tacos and enjoyed them .   My last visit I had an awesome grilled chicken salad. Yes , grilled chicken salad can be awesome. The chicken was grilled to perfection and had lots of seasoning. The dark green salad was enormous and had plenty of freshly chopped veggies including bell pepper ( one of my favorite vegetables).   Know there is patio seating, two bars indoors and a pretty large dining area. Also know that they do great margaritas too.",

The sides here are also really good, my go tos are the avocado pasta And the cheddar and jalapeno mashed potatoes.

That being said, I've missed out on two years where we could have enjoyed Cabo Fish Taco!  I went twice last week and both times it was fantastic!  Cheese dip was average, Guac was wonderful, BBQ Mahi and the Tavaroo tacos were phenomenal!  I'm excited to try some more new things soon!  *quick edit update:  they are using wahoo right now in replacement of the tuna due to oil apparently.   Had the Tavaroo tacos again and it is still wonderful.  Wahoo is a white fish and it was very fresh.  Still a safe order!  :)",

The atmosphere was great for a Saturday night...had to wait a little while for a table so we sat at the bar and had some cokctails - I had the 3 amigos which was pretty good.  Once we sat at our table (about 45 mins later) we started off with the guacamole - it could of used a little more salt, but hey, that's what salt shakers or for.  I then had the carne asada tacos - steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly! My girlfriend had the Mahi Tacos and those were delicious!  For side we black beans & rice as well as the avocado past salad, both very good.  I can't wait to go back try a bunch of other menu items that caught my eye!",

It came with huge chunks of fish, and all of the other ingredients were fresh and delicious. The corn salsa they put out for the table was great!    I had a couple of drinks. One was a specialty margarita, the other was a NoDa Jam session, which is some sort of local beer. Neither drink was very good, at least based on how the server described them. I would probably not drink here in the future, and leave that to one of the many local bars within walking distance.   Definitely recommend if you want something a little different. We went with a large party and everyone seemed very satisfied. I will definitely be back!",

The latter was simply amazing. The traditional (at least what I consider traditional) was just okay. Perhaps I had super high expectations because, oh I don't know, their name includes the words \"Fish Taco\". The corn salsa was fresh and very tasty. The guacamole was just okay but my expectations weren't that of the beer battered fish tacos seeing as how it's not \"Cabo Guacamole Dip\".  This was my first visit so I asked our \"too cool for school\" waiter his recommendation. He smugly responded, \"I haven't had a bad taco in 4 years.\" Dude, I didn't ask how long you've been employed at the establishment, I asked what you recommended from the establishment.   All in all, food was good, nice environment, waiter was a douche.",

We wanted to eat somewhere in Charlotte and decided to pick Cabo Fish Taco because they were featured on Diners, Driveins, and dives. Overall the atmosphere was nice and friendly. For some reason the same dumb song played multiple times during our time there. Not sure what that was about. We were seated in a section that looks like they might open it up to the outside in warmer months. Someone was smoking just on the other side and it was coming in the restaurant.   We ordered cabo rolls and tuna tacos. The tacos and avocado pasta were amazing but the cabo rolls were too salty to eat. When we let our server know she immediately got us a menu to order something in place of the cabo rolls. We ordered the carne asada tacos and they were delicious! The chips weren't warm. I've never been to a good Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve warm chips. They did tasted good and the salsa was yummy and we will definitely return if we ever get to Charlotte again!",

Their food is good, their service is excellent, and it's just got an overall great vibe.  I recommend the queso dip if you want your willpower tested. I'm not usually a fan of queso dips (*gluuurg* calories), but there was something about this one that just.... crack, it had to have been crack. It was crack queso dip.  Cabo Fish Taco serves various forms of crack, skillfully folded into their food. My dining companion was quite taken with the honey wasabi sauce. It went into the Mahi Mahi fish taco she thoroughly enjoyed, and it went into the side of rice. She considered briefly drizzling it into her margarita before she finally resigned to just putting a small lid on the container (thoughtfully provided by our excellent server) and slipping it into her purse.   I had the lemon-grilled shrimp on a corn tortilla (because flour is the devil, or at least my devil), and some sort of chickpea, tomato, and black bean concoction on the side. While the shrimp was tasty and the overall taco was a good blend, he white cilantro sauce (sour cream, yogurt, and cilantro) could *really* have used more, you know, cilantro.. or crack. I'd take crack. I could be biased because I'm a cilantro fiend. Hey, they're good for your kidneys. The salad-ish thing on the side could  have used a lot of something, anything. It was really tasteless. I really like all three of those ingredients normally, but put them together with nothing delicious (or crack-like) to, you know, rule them, find them, and in the darkness bind them... er what? It was just lackluster.   Have I mentioned service was excellent? We came in on New Year's Day and was there ever a day where water was more needed? My glass was always refilled promptly, even as I was sucking down glass #3 or 5 or something.  Definitely worth your while. I'll be back some day, Fish Taco.",

I mean, Cabo Fish Taco - I love Baja California and I LOVE LOVE fish tacos (favorite food, for real, look at my profile). And it's in my hood among other places I frequent. Part of me thinks I'm just being a fish taco snob, but several visits and outside sources have confirmed my original conclusion, this place has terrible fish tacos.  Please remedy this situation. I want to like you, so much, just learn how to grill fish.",

I've tried almost ever taco combination on the menu and its like my 1st time, everythime. Great atmosphere, local art, local beer, and great vibes. I have yet to find a better fish taco anywhere else. Noda Charlotte, NC",

I complained about it because I am obsessed with guac and my waiter even admitted they buy it premade because \"they don't have time to make it\".  Half of the point in going ot a mexican restaurant is for the good guac, so that turned me off right away.  This place is not worth the extremely long wait times.  I would only go back for the environment, not the food.",

    "text": "I really hate to be a debbie downer, I know A LOT of people love this place....but I have a standard, if i can make it at home just as good or better, then it's not worth eating there.  And I would have to say, this is one of those places where I can make it just as good, and probably better at home, and i have had far superior tacos other places that i would go back and pay for.  We got the beer battered shrimp tacos with Nopalito Salad.. The shrimp weren't bad, but not the best i've ever had.  The taste was acceptable, but, as my dad would say, \"it's nothin' to write home to mom about.\"  and the Nopalito salad....ew.  My boyfriend had it there once before and said it was good, but this night he had to give it two thumbs down.  We also ordered BBQ MAHI TACOS, which based on the menu description, sounded like it would be really good!  ( Grilled mango BBQ Mahi-Mahi tacos stuffed with Cabo slaw, tomato, avocado, mixed cheeses & finished with our cilantro white sauce)  Yet when it got to the table, again the flavor was acceptable, but very mediocre.  I got it with the jalapeno mashers, which was apparently mashed potatoes with diced jar jalapenos and shredded cheese on top....and to be honest, i did not like the flavor of the mashed potatoes...there is a spice they put in it that just did not mix well with the flavor of potatoes....maybe cummin? or something like that...not sure, as i haven't really learned to tell completely the flavor of a spices.  But I really couldn't eat more than 2 bites and then thought to myself, its not worth wasting calories on something that doesn't taste good!  lol  The food was also room temperature, I would have expected it to be warmer when it got to the table.    for the money, I would say this place is not worth going back to.  If we would have paid $5  a plate, I wouldn't complain, but it was no were near worth about $10 a person for the quality of food we received.  If you're looking for good tacos, i'd say keep moving....in fact Taco Bell just may be more satisfying, cheaper, and give you hot food.  :)",

I've had better at Taco Bell and sadly, or maybe not, I've had better HERE at Cabo Fish Taco, so what is going on... It does not seem they are slipping it seems more like a Fall a dive in quality and flavor, not a swan dive, a NOSE Dive!  Fishy, Mahi Mahi should not NOT taste fishy especially when it has BBQ sauce to mask the flavor of the Fish, still fishy tasting!  The Menu said it was Mahi, so maybe it was a mistake, we made one too!  Glad to say neither of us became physically ill!  The Mashed Potatoes were so Cold as if they came out of the Refrigerator... Equally as disappointing as the worst parts of the meal!  What is cooler than cold, Tacos at Cabo Fish Taco!  Some food is like Revenge (better when served COLD)!  If they could make everything as good as their Corn Salsa I would be giving them closer to two or three yelp stars!  My Beer Battered Shrimp Taco (the Dish that used to be good here) was the best part of the meal and it was not very good!  The Wrap was COLD and the sauce had little flavor!  The other Dish I previously enjoyed here (years ago) was the Nopalito Salad I call it a Bean and Cactus Salsa! This time it was almost flavorless   The service was friendly and laid back, maybe a little too laid back since our food came out room temperature and since there were only two other tables (of two people each and they were already eating) it would be different if they were busy!  Here is how they approach the question they should have asked \"How was your meal?\"?  Instead they say : \"Everything's good isn't it\"?  They noticed we did not eat very much!  They knew we did not enjoy it!  One improvement is the Boys Bathroom!  Congrats!  This is a good upgrade from years ago!  If the food could have stayed good. I'd settle for going outside like before, (I was not the only one)!  I know you can get in trouble for that, so I'm glad they made that improvement!  The meal was so disappointing we went out to eat AFTER leaving this place!  After an experience this poor I want something good to make sure I still have Taste buds!  I did!!!  This place is probably still very popular and could be a cool place to hang out!  Sincerely I hope they were only having a Bad evening!  I hate writing 1 star reviews!",

    "text": "This place is AWESOME over in the NODA area. We have made the way over from South Charlotte on several occasions and have NEVER been disappointed. They have a standard menu of the typical taco choices, however they ALWAYS have a special two choices wrote on the ever so colorful chalk board along with the drink specials.. The staff is varies which is pretty cool, they include tatted up people, college students, Goth, Hippy, Happy, etc.. EVERYONE work well together and are all HAPPY to be there working and appear to LOVE their job. I must say the ladies room on the left side of the venue is pretty funny. The door has a lady on it and when you enter you enter to one sink and two toilets with no separation between the two commodes other than a small wicker basket with 3 drawers containing tissue. THIS IS PRETTY AWESOME to me ONLY because it has been several times that me and the ladies have gone out and we all have to go equally as bad and with this set up we can go at the same time.. NOT SURE I'D WANT TO only because that's awkward squatting next to your friend. What type of conversation happens when you are squatting next to your girlfriend LOL.. I LIKE it for taking my daughter to the restroom with me as we are able to go in at the same time and have an additional commode if she get the urge while waiting on me..  Enough about the LADIES ROOM.. Some of my many check-ins are below with what I was indulging in with the Mr. or with my daughter or with the Ladies:     Jerk Salmon & Grilled Mahi Tacos!  the chipotle lime salmon taco & beer battered shrimp taco is a winning combination ;-)  Blacken Seabass taco special is a must!!  The chips & in house fresh salsa is SPICY & AWESOME. Any of the various fish tacos are great I LOVE the grilled Mahi Mahi & Shrimp taco..  Salsa & Chips is very TASTY & a tad bit Spicy which I LOVE!!  Cons: There is a SERIOUS wait time on the weekends in the evening as the place is popular. Not sure if that's a CON because it's GREAT BUSINESS for a GREAT restaurant.",

    "text": "I had a fish taco craze last year and that was pretty much the only thing I ate for about a month. Still, I am not a self-proclaimed taco connoisseur and will not pretend to know everything there is to know about the dish.   I will tell you that in my short-lived taco-eating career, Cabo Fish Taco definitely tops the list of delicious tacos I've eaten. And I've tried all kinds. Korean bulgogi tacos to Vietnamese pork belly tacos to traditional carne asada tacos.   Seems to me that there are three main components  to the taco:   1) the protein  2) the case (wrap) 3) the garnish  While most of the tacos I've eaten have excelled in 1 and 3, few have been able to come up with an astounding 2 the way Cabo Fish Taco does. I would describe the \"case\" as a crisp soft shell. It's a light and fluffy, doughy bite with a crisp finish (literally). Reminds me of the Indian puri. Then you get this magnificent choice of beef, chicken, blackened mahi-mahi, lemon grilled shrimp...the list goes on of meat to flavor your taco up. Loved the shrimp in particular. Finally they sprinkle on an assortment of sweet, sour, tangy or creamy toppings that are powerful and enticing. Even after you inhale the taco though, you don't feel like a beached whale. You could eat these all day!  They also have some sick margaritas (see photo)  The one area that disappointed me greatly was the quality of the appetizers. Yes the guac is fresh avocado - but unseasoned and plain? The \"queso\" tasted nothing short of Moes Grill's mass-produced queso. They could've tried harder on the easy parts!  4/5",

It's like a portal to a seafood shack somewhere in a beach town.   Once seated, you are greeted with chips and what I think is homemade salsa. It was great! Definitely a different take from your typical restaurant salsa that is runny.   But, I didn't come here for salsa. I came for the fish tacos - they did not disappoint. I had both the battered shrimp and fish, both were so delicious. I ended up asking for lime to complement the tacos, which was definitely the right decision.  I would definitely visit this joint again, it was a great spot in a really fun neighborhood.",

I ordered the chicken and shrimp burrito again, and this time it actually came out correctly. BUT! We also ordered a salmon baja bowl and not to my surprise it came out with shrimp on it. I don't know where the gap in communication is with this restaurant. It may be the volume of music that is so loud the wait staff can't hear the order, or may the chefs can't read. Both times I have gone they have given me the wrong food. It's a shame the service is so poor because the food is delicious. Won't be returning.",

However, since I was in the neighborhood around lunch-time, I decided to stop in and give them a try.  I was by myself, so I just sat at the bar.  On my visit, I was very fortunate because the service was good and they had my order ready super-quick. (Probably because the owner was in the kitchen as one of the bartenders told me).  In any case, I decided to order the Tavarua Wahoo Tacos ($10.50). This consisted of blackened wahoo in a kiwi-pineapple fajita sauce, with lettuce, tomato, cheese, & a honey wasabi sauce.   The dish came with 2 tacos and your choice of a side dish.  The fish was perfectly cooked and had a nice balance of flavors. The tacos had a good amount of fish and tasted really good. I was a little worried that they might go overboard on the wasabi, but it was just the right amount.  For the side dish,  I went with the black beans & rice.  The side dish was ok, but the black beans could have used a little more seasoning.   The chips on my visit were fresh & crispy.  The salsa seemed to be made in house and had a nice flavor but was mostly corn and could have used a little more tomato and a little more heat.    Overall, I enjoyed my lunch and had good service, so I would definitely go back.",

I went here quite a few times my time in Charlotte and always enjoyed it. You got superb people watching, cold beers, a decent patio area (albeit more mosquitoes than I care to have around me at one time) and reliable food. As for the inside, I have no clue about it and really don't remember it that much. Hmmmm....that can't be a good sign. But I blame it either on beer or the fact that I always sat outside (even in the fall, again, big hmmmm). The first thing I ever ordered there was the BBQ Mahi Tacos and I never strayed from it because I loved it so much. But I think more of that was due to the tortillas than anything, you could put an old dirty show in one of their tortillas and I would eat because I'm nasty like that. And now I'm in FL craving Cabo, anyone want to overnight it? Thanks!",

You can style and profile all that you want, but I want to eat some delicious food when I go to a restaurant. I do like the Goth girls, but then.....I always find stupidity amusing.   * Flavorless whitefish tacos. There are literally dozens of Hispanic restaurants, featuring superior fish tacos, in and around CLT.   * Weird Cold Corn Salsa with Stale \"Cardboard\" Blue Corn Tortillas. Creative? Yes. Tasty? Mmmm, No. Give me chunky, freshly made at one's tableside, pico de gallo guacamole any day of the week and twice on Sunday. (Served with hot tortilla chips, which doesn't happen here!)  * Difficult parking. YMCA parking lot, and we're walking there.   * Expensive. There's no reason for fish tacos to cost this much, and to be so effing mediocre. If the fish were freshly caught that morning off the coast of Charleston, or served somewhere along the PCH, yeah, maybe I could see their prices as realistic. Here, you're just paying for the cool factor of dining in NODA, and screw that.  ** Their location nets one star, and they usually have competent waitstaff, which procures the second star.   PS: I like Guy Fieri, but he's not always right.",

    "text": "I have to say, these fish tacos are mighty good.    I was reading an article in Charlotte's edition of Creative Loafing and the writer mentioned ordering two specific tacos which he found to be delightful. Having lived most of my life near the coast, I have a rule about eating seafood so far inland. Yet, I've heard nothing but good things about this restaurant and I was literally a block away..so how could I resist?  I ordered a BBQ Mahi taco, which I'm told was featured on 'Diner's, Drive In and Dives.'  The fish wasn't as fresh as it would be at a beachfront taco stand and the sauce was a tad sweet for me, but that was nothing a little hot sauce couldn't fix.   I also ordered a Tavaroo Tuna taco, which had a hint of wasabi and was fantastic.   It was early Saturday night and the dining room was filling up quickly, so I sat at the bar and could observe everything coming out of the kitchen..and it all looked delectable.    Nice margarita menu and beer selection too.",

Both were very tasty; however, I preferred the Shrimp tacos out of the two.  We each were able to select from a choice of several sides which we did,  Our waitress Heather was very prompt and courteous and was very good about checking in with us.  Chris, the GM, came over to our table and once he found out we were from out of town / state, he sat down and began giving us recommendations on local eateries as well as brew pubs.  Chris was very cool!!  Definitely would go back, and definitely recommend!!",

    "text": "I hear hoots and hollers about this staple of the NoDa district but I was honestly not too impressed. I went in with two other friends. The hostess was polite and friendly and entertained me with a chat while I waited for my friends to show. But this was more of an obligation as Cabo is one of those places where they will not seat you if your whole party is not there. Even on a Tuesday night when half the restaurant is empty. So don't even ask.  When they showed up and we got our table we each ordered something a little different. I split my taco choice getting one with fried shrimp and the other with fried fish - it was a fried food kind of night for me. My friends got salmon tacos straight-up and the salmon salad. For starters the salad and the salmon in it were pretty tasty. I can't remember if it was guacamole or sliced avocados in it but either way it was a delicious addition. Apparently that salad is one of the hottest things on the menu here.  But my other friend and I figured on the namesake of the place and went with the tacos. The plates came out with that delicious smell of fried and grilled fish and we dove in. But the fried fish was tasteless and 3/4 fried batter crust which just blanketed the general flavor. The fried shrimp was okay but in general the tacos were lacking in additional spices. If you want better seafood or other types of tacos I would suggest Krazy Fish first and foremost. Most likely I will be back to Cabo for some function or other gathering but I won't likely bank on the tacos again. That salad will be what I go for next.",

The fella and I went out with some friends after work on a Friday evening, and we all managed to get there at different times. If I were the waitress, this would've seriously annoyed me, but our waitress was so nice and accommodating!  We sat on the bar side at a table, and all the doors were open since it was so nice outside.  Throw in a little reggae music and a margarita, and how can you go wrong?  We ordered the Baja Shrimp & Crab Dip and guacamole to start.  The pita for the dip is fried... YUM.  It was warm and buttery, and the guacamole was solid.  (As much as I love avocados, it's hard to focus on them when there's fried bread.)  I got the carne asada tacos for dinner.  The steak was tender and perfectly seasoned, and the peppers and onions balanced out the southwest mayo.  I wish I could tell you what everyone else got, but I was a little too focused on my own food to nicely ask how everyone else's food tasted.  Oops.  By the time we left, the place was slammed and we heard them mention a 40 minute wait.  You'd never know how busy they were from the staff though - our waitress was awesome, and the manager checked in on us once and said bye as we left.  I love some good customer service!  Perhaps I'd misjudged Cabo... I'll definitely be back.",

Okay, not such a big deal. Then comes the guacamole. YUCK! I think it would be better in a diner. Sort of brown and taste is really gross. Then a couple of minutes later dinner comes. We never even had a chance to eat our disgusting guacamole. Haha. I ordered the Bbq Mahi tacos. The sauce was really good but very spicy. I wish I had known that.

    "text": "As a first timer, I can honestly say that my expectations were blown away by this place. I could seriously eat here every day for the rest of my life and be totally okay with it. I love Mexican and I love fish, so I am predisposed to like any place that combines the two.  While visiting friends, they drove us around different neighborhoods and pointed out Cabo Fish Tacos while we were in NoDa. While they were at work the next day, I went back right as they opened at 11am for an early lunch. The service was amazing (granted they weren't exactly swamped at the time), and kept the water and chips and salsa coming all meal long. It didn't take very long to get our orders.  My boyfriend got the grilled mahi mahi and the steak special taco and I got a grilled mahi mahi and a BBQ mahi mahi. First: the shell. Awesome, a little puffy, not overly greasy, although a little flimsy on the BBQ taco. Second: The fish. I can't think of any place I've ever been where I've gotten that much fish (and great quality fish at that) in a fish taco. At first I didn't think two would fill me up, but they definitely do! I am not a huge BBQ person, so I preferred the grilled, but they were both excellent. I got the rice and beans as a side, and they were a little spicy compared to what I'm used to and whatever spice they used kind of stuck in my teeth, so that was the only \"miss\" of the meal for me.   I'm bummed I don't live in Charlotte because this would definitely be a regular place of mine. I will definitely be returning next time I'm in town!  Hopefully I'll get to try some of their awesome looking margaritas next time too!",

    "text": "I have been OBSESSED with Cabo Fish Taco lately! I randomly get a hankering for cool, fresh, fish tacos and my brain immediately screams \"Cabo!\". Usually, I answer it and head to NODA where I can munch on tacos and hot crab dip.   The service is always on point here. I even once had a server plug up my dying iPhone by the server stand so I could keep an eye on work things over dinner. I tried to offer her $5 for charging my phone even though we had moved to a different server's section and she refused to take it! Good peeps over there.  The decor and vibe of Cabo is very NODA-esque and fun. It reminds me of grabbing a bite to eat at a restaurant in Florida after a long day on the beach. The patio can seat quite a few people and is good for some interesting people-watching! There are also TV's at the bar if you don't want to miss a game.   Cabo has an extensive margarita menu and a decent beer selection as well. But the best thing about this pace is the delicious food. You just can't go wrong with any taco you order from the menu. I think their Taveroo (sp?) and Blackened Mahi might be the best, though. :) Every table receives fresh corn salsa and chips before their meal and I always end up filling up on that stuff too early because it's so dang good! The food always tastes so fresh and is packed with delicious flavor. I've never had anything bad here, nor had a bad experience. I love this place and it's a no-brainer for the summer!",

It was a suggestion of my hotel Bartender as a good place to get food in NODA, with other places nearby to explore. I sat at the bar and enjoyed a margarita from a very nice young lady whose name escapes me - it was a unique name - but thank you to her because her suggestions on where to go next (\"see Mike and Kelly @ Davidson Street Public House\") would kick off my tour of bars and restaurants. I got a burrito with seared ahi tuna, wasabi, and avocado maybe? I can't remember everything in it but t was amazing. The only drawback was that the bar and restaurant as a whole were sticky and messy. I usually hate this about a place but I did roll in within 30 minutes of closing and I could tell it had been a busy night so I give them a general pass on that aspect. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend Cabo Fish Taco to anyone. And I will be back! Maybe next time for happy hour ;)",

We took a 5 or 6 mile detour off the highway after researching good places from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives between Atlanta and Washington, DC (long car trip!) to stop at Cabo. It was one of the best meals of the trip!  I really like that you can mix and match tacos on your plate - you aren't committed to two of the same tacos, you can swap from one of the specials or any of the others featured on the menu. I got the BBQ Mahi, the sheepshead (fish) special, and the cactus side salad. The BBQ Mahi was DELICIOUS - I can't say enough good things! The sheepshead (which I've never had before - mild flavor) would be good any other day of the week, but it was hard to compare after the BBQ Mahi. My boyfriend got the avocado pasta salad, and I'd recommend that over the cactus salad (the salad wasn't bad, just a lot of beans to it - fresh flavor though).  If you're in the area or passing through on the highway, I would definitely recommend this stop. It's worth it!",

The bowl of mostly corn with a few chunks of tomatoes, the perfect scant amount of onions, cilantro and spices was actually sitting on the chips and sloshed on them on the way to the table so the bottom half of the bowl of chips was soggy.

The vibe is definitely casual and hip with a lot of open seating and a great little patio outside. As others have stated, parking can be a pain in the butt, but if you drive around the corner there is ample street parking along side roads within a short distance. Hope my fellow NC natives have been working on the elusive skill of  parallel parking because you will need it here.   Ordered the honey soy glazed salmon tacos which were well cooked and on point. I could do without the sauce they put on it some sort of creama it just makes the flavors too complex and not in a good way. The avocado pasta salad was good, but definitely could have used more salt.    Will definitely come back to try some other things on the menu. As others said, it can get kind of loud. Recently visited during lunch on a weekday and the place was maybe at 40% capacity and a bit loud, so keep that in mind if you're looking for something more intimate.",

I appreciated that the tortillas were fried and the flavors were good, but my tacos were pretty cold (not just room temperature but cold to the touch). I feel bad now I didn't say anything to the waitress. The fish tasted like it had been cooked a long while ago and our food came out quickly which is a little disheartening.

When you walk in you have left Charlotte and been transported to a small Cabo beach taco stand with reggae playing the soundtrack in the background and you are instantly relaxed!   My guy and I went the other day and sat at the bar and got started with margaritas while looking over the menu. We had a super sweet bartender that made some great suggestions for not just the drinks but the tacos as well and with so many options to choose from it was much appreciated. I had tuna tacos and my love had the crispy tofu which he must have really liked because they were gone in minutes. Both kinds were amazing and I love their roasted corn salsa they bring to you it's so fresh and different from other places that bring you the staple chips and salsa to start it was nice to have something new. The service was amazing as I had ordered the wrong tuna tacos and just based off a question I asked (as I had no idea I got the wrong ones which was my fault) the bartender not only let me keep the ones I had but insisted on bringing me the other ones as well! Such great service!   There is plenty of indoor seating as well as a small outside area which is great when the weather is nice. Parking is easy there are street spots as well as at night you can park in the ymca lot down a few blocks.   Overall a great spot for any occasion you gotta check it out!",

Whenever I had friends in town I would always try to take them there to eat.  So, I was not surprised to see Cabo Fish Taco high on the list with good reviews when I was visiting Charlotte and I looked up what restaurants were popular in the area. My boyfriend and I decided to check out cabo for lunch so he could get a taste of it for himself. Of course, even cabo fish taco in Charlotte did no disappoint. The restaurant is located in a nice little artsy area known as NODA. Just as you would expect. the interior is something you would imagine for a restaurant near the beach - almost like a surf shack.   I generally always order some form of taco. When in Charlotte, I saw a new one that I haven't tried yet, the TAVARUA (TAV-A-ROO) TUNA TACOS so, of course that's what I went with. Ahhh, these were so good - even our server mentioned that they were her favorite! I didn't really expect them to have a spicy flavor but the honey wasabi sauce definitely added a kick. Also, if you didn't know, you get complimentary chips & corn salsa to start you off which is delicious.  If you haven't been here yet, you should definitely check it out! Whether you're with friends, family, solo, a date - Cabo Fish Taco is very versatile so I think it would be a fitting place for any occasion!",

    "text": "The key to getting a table at Cabo Fish Taco without a long wait: Go for lunch! We have previously tried going here for dinner and found the wait to be ridiculous. So this time we planned accordingly and came for lunch around 12:15 on a Saturday. No wait for us! But as we were leaving, there was quite a crowd waiting for a table, so be sure to get here earlier rather than later unless you want to wait.   The service and food here was really good! We asked our server what he recommended and he pointed out 4 of their most popular specialty tacos. So instead of having 2 of the same tacos for each of our meals, we mixed each of our meals up and got to try the 4 that he recommended. The BBQ Mahi and the Honey Soy Glazed Salmon were my overall favorites in terms of flavor. But as for the fish, I really liked the quality of the tuna that was in the Tavarua Tuna tacos.  The fourth one we tried was the Lemon Grilled Shrimp, which was just ok in comparison. I think this is one of their \"safer\" options for those who are not crazy about fish.  To me, it needed a little more kick or spice. I also found that the fish tacos were WAY more filled than the shrimp taco.  Overall, the food was really good but it wasn't mind-blowing. It was solid food, solid service and a solid atmosphere. Worth trying!",

    "text": "It was a lot easier to get a seat, grab a taco and leave back when Cabo was a place where mainly those of an artistic bent hung out.  Suddenly Fat City was torn down, more restaurants moved in and NoDa became an acceptable place for the crowd that never left Uptown before that point.  Enter hour-long waits to get food and a slight decline in the quality of the food.  But we all must move forward....  Cabo has finally torn down the wall and expanded their restaurant!  Hopefully this will continue to alleviate the wait time and it won't be such a pain in the ass to eat here.  I'm a big fan of the corn salsa and nepalitos salad.  I typically stick with the blackened mahi tacos since the fish on their taco specials is not really as exciting as it used to be.  Service is often quite good, but there are days where it can be piss poor, too.  Overall I'm happy with service, though.    I don't go to Cabo because they make the best tacos I've ever had or because they have an extensive beer menu.  I go to Cabo to eat an above average taco, drink some cheap Mexican beer (probably from a can AND with an unnecessary piece of citrus fruit) and enjoy a sunny day outside while sitting inside.  I also like to stare at Will Puckett's art and wish that I actually had the talent to paint.",

Lets start with the bad:  the guacamole looked very manufactured.  It effectively was a scoop of avocado (clearly scooped from a large container) with a number of other toppings (jalapeno, onion, NO tomato) scattered on top.  It took work to mix it into guacamole and still wasn't that good.  The BBQ Mahi Tacos were drowned in a white mayonaisey sauce, which was way too heavy. On the positive side, the Tavarua were incredible.  The Wasabi was perfectly proportioned and the taste was delicate and delicious.",

    "text": "Eating at Cabo, or anywhere in NoDa on a Saturday night, is a bit of an adventure. Our most recent was on an uncharacteristically snowy evening in Charlotte, which lent the night a sort of mystical austerity, as if magic were ordained by the decent of the twinkling flakes falling all around us.  Our posse of seven put in for a table, which is no easy feat for a restaurant Cabo's size. We were told it'd be forty-five minutes, which delighted us, since that afforded time for at least six or seven glasses of wine at Dolce next door.  Scarf-ensconced, snow-laden, half-lit and stumble-happy, we received a text that our table was ready and made way for the gloomy labyrinth of NoDa's most prestigious fish taco waystation.  Echoing lively with an always handsome mix of dirty hippies, uptowners slumming it in the \"artsy\" area, and cleverly-paired retirees done up to the nines, the Cabo dining room reminds me of the background setting in a rom-com where the couple has its first hilariously awkward fight. It's somehow both romantic and unsettling... but in a good way.  Our tables were still being cleared and arranged when we walked in, so I spearheaded a mission to obtain one quick round of Dos Equis Ambers from the bar. The mission was a success. Lime-treated frothy brews in hand, we took to our table, not nearly sized for seven people, elbows bumping, thigh to thigh, alcy breath exchanging hot between us. I looked across to Huxley, that soul-stealing mermaid-haired goddess of mischief and misreason, and toothed her a goofy grin. \"I've never felt closer to all of you,\" I said.  Our waitress came up, god bless her, pale and long, sheer gray cotton draped snug and purposeful around the rolling chalice of her body, shoulders high and firm, chopped blonde chin-cut springing around the soft features of her face... AJ kicked my shin under the table and shot me a wide-eyed, closed-mouth stare. He knows my type.  Huxley sneered. With rich voice, full and lively, our waitress greeted us, accepted my immediate request for more beers, and then sold us, vividly, on the day's specials - southwestern style fried oysters appetizer (it has long been established that I and Mine are suckers for oysters in any condition), rainbow trout wraps with black-beans and a spicy sauce, or some whitefish taco that I'm pretty sure she called \"Drunk Fish\". We ordered several of each.  In a brilliant flash, she was back with the beers. I doled them out with jittering hands, all aslosh and messy. We toasted the night, \"To fish tacos and our semi-annual snowfall!\" As glasses clanked together, we heard a crashing thud against the front glass of the dining room. Outside in the street, a band of scrawny hipsters were engaging in an epic snowball fight. Our waitress walked past and startled at the noise; she turned toward us and laughed. \"We should be out there with them,\" AJ said. He motioned to the waitress. \"So should you!\" I nodded in enthusiastic agreement. She giggled and said she was totally into it... but we were too focused on food and drink to actually break out into an impromptu snowball fight at that moment, unreasonably attractive waitress participant notwithstanding.  While we waited for our entrees, we gorged on oysters and Dos Equis, and told each other, plainly, how badly and intensely we were all in love. Whilst perusing the margaritas menu, Nellie and I had a gruesome conversation about our respective past experiences that have led to our present inability to conceive of anything containing Tequila.  And then, the food. Oh glorious frozen twinkling mad and descending all around us. Assaulted by flavors, the trout, dear god that trout... it fell apart in our mouths like a shattered dream... and the drunk fish, drunk fish as it was, moist and white and flaky pure, all dressed up in spice and glaze, oozing, flowing, plates exchanges and forkfulls shared, cheeks stained and scarves like napkins, and flickering votives and cream stuck in beards and delicate fingers soaked through by the morsels they gripped.  Hux reached across the table, fetched my chin, and with the most deft and subtle movements of her spiderlike fingers, tipped away some flake or smear that I had smattered about my face. \"I'm always a mess,\" I said. She smiled that cutting smile. \"That's why we work together; I'm always flawless.\" Our gray-wrapped wedge-cut goldilocks came back. \"How should I split this up?\" she asked.  \"Look at us, doll,\" I said to her before glancing back around the table. \"We're all in this together.\"  She grinned a pearly grin. \"So, that's one check then?\" I nodded.  Outside, drunk and full and spinning wild, I held the door for my men and my ladies. As I turned to face the street, I caught a cold, hard ball of fresh-packed snow right to the left eye socket. I cursed and coiled over. As my vision cleared and sensation returned to my cheek, I looked up to see Huxley laughing maniacally and dusting snow off her palms.  \"Thanks for dinner,\" she said.",

Most likely going to avoid Cabo from now on, and I'm hoping that I feel better soon. :(",

We walked in 30 minutes after they opened so wer were immediately sat at a table. I was told that they get super busy pretty early and it last most of the day.  They brough complimentary chips & salsa and the salsa was obviously homemade with lots of flavor. We ordered queso that was also good. I ordered 2 tuna tacos (1 Tavarua Taco & 1 BBQ Mahi Taco). Both were great but the Tavarua was just plain nuts. It has honey wasabi sauce and I'm a big fan of wasabi. I know they've gotten sub-par reviews but my visit was really good. I'll look to visit again the next time I'm in Charlotte.",

    "text": "I've heard great things about this place and I was dying to see what all the hype was about.  I came with some friends on a Saturday evening around 7pm, and let me just say BAD timing.  The place was packed and we had to wait almost an hour to get seated (there were 5 in our group).  There are 2 bars and we were able to grab beers and chat while we were waiting, but it was so packed there wasn't a whole lot of room for us even in the bar area.  After we were finally seated our food was served to us by a frustrated little man.  He seemed agitated and he wasn't very pleasant.  I had the signature tacos, one with beer battered white fish and the other was beer battered shrimp just to make sure I got my fill of fried goodness.  I ordered the jalapeno and cheese mashers (mashed potatoes topped with shredded cheese and chopped jalapenos from a jar) which I thought were pretty tasty.  My tacos were decent but seemed to be lacking flavor, maybe needed more sauce of some sort.  They seemed dry and I nearly choked on the lettuce and tortilla shell because it felt like eating paper.  Parking is extremely limited especially on a busy weekend night.  The prices are decent and they had a fairly good selection of beer on tap.  Overall this would be a great place to stop in for lunch but I definitely won't be back for dinner.",

Chips and corn salsa can go either way- sometimes they are fresh and delicious - sometimes they are stale and not so delicious.   I had the lemon tuna tacos yesterday and they were just-ok. I like my tuna on the rarer side so this didn't really do it for me. The cabo fish tacos are just ok in my opinion -although I am not a huge fried fish eater. I am not so into the steak tacos either.   The jalapeno mashers  are really tasty although they certainly are not the most health conscious choice   Margaritas are pretty standard here. I've had good luck in terms of service and the place itself is really cool.  Solid 3.5-4 ( 4 if I get my go-to meal)",

Was very excited to try their fish tacos and was not let down!  The meal started with their unique corn salsa, a delicious mix of corn kernels, green bell pepper and tomoatoes served with tortilla chips.  For lunch I ordered their Tuna tacos with a honey wasabi sauce which was served with a side of mashed potatoes mixed with jalapeno peppers sliced in and cheese. The tacos were excellent with plenty of tuna and the wasabi sauce was unique, tasty and had the right amount of kick to it. While mashed potatoes are not usually thought of as a Mexican side dish, they were delicious and the jalapenos and cheese really added to their flavor. The whole meal washed down with a local Charlotte craft beer was the perfect lunch on a cold winter afternoon!",

    "text": "I was visiting my good friend from Charlotte this past weekend. She proclaimed that, no matter how long the wait, we HAD to go to Cabo. I was a little tired from the 2 and a half hour drive, but reluctantly agreed to brave the wait (which was 45 minutes). We were able to get a place at the bar and were immediately given chips and corn salsa. I was a bit disappointed when I looked at their drink menu and saw it full of my \"NEVER drink of choice\"... margaritas. However, my friend told me I HAD to try a margarita (peer pressure...), so I went with the Purple Haze (no salt). It was actually delicious--a little sweet and not overly \"tequila\" tasting. The bartenders were very nice--two of them offered to serve us dinner at the bar so we didn't have to keep waiting. We decided to wait for a table, which worked out pretty well, because after we ordered our second round, the hostess called our name to be seated. With the excellent bar service and upbeat atmosphere, the 45-minute wait didn't feel very long at all.  When we sat down at our table, our waiter immediately greeted us with more chips and salsa (not like I needed anymore...). We asked for water, and he brought us that in under a minute. During our wait, I glanced at a menu, so I already knew what I wanted (the blackened mahi-mahi tacos). We ordered our food and seriously (I am not kidding) 5 minutes (tops) later, our food was at our table. We were both shocked. I mean, I guess tacos aren't that difficult to make, but that is still impressive for a very crowded restaurant. I had the herb mashed potatoes as a side, which were very good. I absolutely loved the mahi-mahi tacos--and the tortillas (I believe they make them in-house) were delicious. Unfortunately, I was a little full from drinks and chips earlier and wasn't able to finish my food, but I definitely would have if I had the room (this is saying a lot...I'm rarely able to eat a whole meal in its entirety!). Our waiter brought us our checks when it was evident that we were done eating, and even made the effort to refill my friend's water after we had already cashed out. It was nice to feel like we weren't forgotten because we already paid. I left Cabo Fish Taco very full and very much so wishing there was one in Chapel Hill! I definitely recommend it for anyone that loves seafood--even if there is a 45 minute wait!",

    "text": "Yes, Cabo Fish Taco seems to be like a mecca for the throngs of people standing on the street corner waiting to get in on a gallery crawl Friday night in NoDa.  And Guy Fieri stopped by to film his Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives show for food network there.  And it is known to be a favorite of NASCAR driver, Kasey Kahne.  But it is also just plain old solid food.  The owners finally knocked out the wall and expanded into the adjacent space after years of slowly doing the construction themselves and it was worth the wait.  They did a fine job adding the nicely finished surfboard bar as well as a refreshing street side outdoor dining area.  If you close your eyes you can imagine that the cars driving by are the sound of waves crashing... alright maybe not...  The fish tacos are obviously good.  The barbecue mahi mahi is insanely tasty.  Personally, I stick with the shrimp tacos when I am going the taco route.  And that is only because there was a lot of inconsistency with the steak tacos.  Sometimes extremely oversalted.  The wraps are also good as I am a fan of the Southwest Chicken wrap.  The combination of just enough spicy with the cooling cucumbers is the key.  For heavier fare, the Surf and Turf Pasta is good.  Plenty of shrimp and steak with bowtie pasta.  Although, it would be easier to eat if they finished prepping the shrimp by taking off the tails.  Sometimes, you just don't feel like eating with your fingers.  The margarita menu is expansive and good.  When the mood hits me, the Silver Surfer satisfies.  Otherwise, they have a solid beer selection to choose from.  Yes, the chips are usually cold, and the corn in the free salsa is canned.  But if you throw in a side of queso, it will curb the appetite that you built up while waiting on the street...",

I went with a friend and we were catching up for quite a while, but our waitress was friendly and didn't rush us, which I appreciated.

If you order a salad be prepared to have a bowl full of roughly chopped veggies that you have to cut yourself (an entire huge tomato in quarters... Bell peppers and red onion in 1 inch think chucks).  The tuna (ordered medium) is dry as toast... Although my boyfriends tuna burrito is a perfect medium.  The margaritas are watered down and the chips are stale (and definite not home made).  The cheese dip is heavy as a brick and tastes (and looks like velveeta).  What else is there to say?",

We were seated, given menus and told about the drink specials which were sort of bleh so we stuck with soft drinks. They followed it up with some complimentary corn salsa & chips, thank god they don't charge for it. The taste was very bland and forgettable but still a nice gesture nonetheless. Luckily, they kept their namesake intact because there fish taco's were quite tasty, not a huge portion but certainly filling enough to get your money's worth. I went with the lemon pepper variety while my date had the more traditional version. Service was a bit sluggish, by the time we finished  our meal I had to flag down our waitress to get our check and get out of there. Certainly a good enough place to dine at whenever I'm on that side of town for poetry, but not a place to really go out of your way for in my opinion. Parking is a little scarce usually have to squeeze a spot on the side of the street or a find a lot a block or so away and work your way back up to the location. All in all, hard to find a good authentic fish taco, so if that's what you have a taste for this place certainly caters to that niche.",

It was very busy when I was there on Saturday afternoon. We got there in the late afternoon and there was a line. I got a pre-salivation going. We got in pretty fast and the waitress was fantastic. She took her time going over the menu and giving us tips about the food. We had a few questions and ordered. I had the Tavaroo Tuna Taco's and my GF had the BBQ Mahi Taco's. It did take some time for the taco's to get there and that would be my only complaint but they kept bringing those delicious corn taco chips and the corn salsa so that kept me happy. They had a nice beer list also. Always a big plus for me! Then we saw the taco's and got very happy. These things are huge. My GF and I split ours so I got to have BBQ Mahi also. Wow is all i could say. The sauces and the delicious fish were amazing. I would go back in a heartbeat but since I don't live anywhere near, I am just plain sad :( . There is nothing like this where i live but if I am in Charlotte again in the near future, I will certainly be going back. Hail to the Fish Taco at Cabo's!!!!",

Young waitstaff who were really friendly and energetic waited on you and gave good suggestions for grub. They have a red bull mixed drink that is AMAZING--if you like red bull that is, I forget what they added into it but it was great.  I had the black bean soup, it was spicy and not boring by any means. The tacos I had were not the most tasty but maybe it was because I got the grilled ones and also b/c I had just had a really tasty soup right before.  I would recommend the place though for a relaxed hang out and decent tex mexy kinda food.",

I cruised through the NoDa area and when I saw Cabo I recalled the decent Yelp! reviews so I figured I'd give it a try.  I went on a Monday night so it wasn't too busy (the rest of NoDa was a ghost town) and the service was prompt and friendly.  I ordered the jalapeno & cheese 'mashers' which I presupposed meant mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately, I was giving the beans and rice, kind of a downer as my GF ordered the beans and rice and we wouldn't get to see what both sides were like.  In the server's defense, she did ask a moment after bringing it out if everything came out right.  I enjoyed everything else enough to just overlook the error.  The chips and salsa were good and, as this was my first time here, came as a bit of a pleasant surprise.  Price-wise I think it was about what I expected $22 for two meals w/ water and tax+tip.  If it was half that price I'd be here everyday perhaps.  One more note, they let me switch the cilantro (yuck) white sauce for honey wasabi (yummy) sauce without a problem.",

You get chips and salsa to start - but its not even salsa.  Its a bowl that looks like they threw a handful of canned corn in the bottom, chopped some tomatoes and onions on top and then added in some picked cactus.  It was vinegary and just bad.  I asked if they had some other salsa, and they brought me a ketchup flavored bowl of yuck.... On to the main course... I ordered the beer battered shrimp tacos, thinking the seafood tacos would be their star dish.  The tortillas were fried, the shrimp had no flavor, and it just tasted greasy and bland.  This place probably stays in business because it is one of the onyl restaurants on the block.  Save yourself the money!",

    "text": "I've been meaning to go to Cabo Fish Taco for many moons and never got around to it. NoDa, despite all it has to offer, is not a neighborhood I frequent. On this night a group of us were celebrating Becky's birthday and our original destination was actually Heist Brewery. The friendly staff at Heist told us that we had a two hour wait so we decided to skip Heist since we were all pretty hungry.  Cabo was packed, and originally we were told there was a 20 minute wait. Fortunately they told us the bar was open so we opted for that option. Ultimately we ended up eating at the bar since we didn't want to wait for a table.  The atmosphere is cool and hipster, not unlike anything else you'd expect in NoDa. The decor was great and the restaurant is ample. I especially loved the ceilings which had been untouched for quite some time and still had the original  The first thing they brought us was this corn-based pico de gallo-style salsa. I've never seen this style of salsa with so much corn but it was great. For my taste though, I could have done with 50% less corn and add maybe a little bit of cabbage instead. Chips were nice too, nothing special.  I ordered the wasabi tuna burrito which was excellent. No complaints at all. It would have never occurred to me to wrap those ingredients and wrap them in a flour tortilla to make them a burrito but it was one of the better dishes I've had lately. The wasabi was there... boom! Front and center in every bite. My tuna was perfectly cooked with a lot of pink in the middle and the avocado sent the whole thing to rock stardom.  Becky ordered the same but in taco form.  The beer selection was decent, as many other eateries in the area they seem to have dedicated a few tabs to local/regional breweries which is always nice to see (although lately it seems that our own loyalty to the local/regional breweries is limiting the availability of other small/medium breweries, oh well). I had one of Birdsong's Jalapeno Pale Ale (what else will you have with a wasabi tuna burrito?!).  Loved Cabo Fish Taco and want to go back to try more of their dishes!",

Parking can be a pain in NoDa, but if you drive around a little, you can often find something.   The one downside to this place is that there is no reservations.   :(   So you will have to wait.   But they will take down your number and you can check the status of your wait while you enjoy some drinks at a neighboring bar.    The other downside is that it can get loud inside.   Therefore if it is nice outside, I recommend sitting on the patio where it is a little less loud.   Even with the down \"downsides\" though, it is definitely worth going to!",

    "text": "One of NODAs hot spots!  I have been to Cabo Fish Taco for the last few years.  This place is AWESOMELY delicious!  Let's start from the very beginning...when you sit down, you are greeted by some chips and salsa.  But not just any kind of salsa, corn salsa.  The salsa is a good mix of sweet and regular salsa-y.  The chips add a nice saltiness to it.  Then the margaritas are refreshing with a good balance of sweetness and tequila.  I always get the Mahi Mahi fish tacos with usually one of their taco specials.  I love how you can mix and match the different tacos.  The tortilla they are served on is hard to describe.  It is more flaky and light than your average flour tortilla.  The ingredients in the tacos are very fresh and flavorful.  Lastly, I am always craving the jalapeno mash potatoes, because they are THE best mash potatoes I have ever had.  However, they are only served as a seasonal side.  So I am disappointed when they are not an option and have to get my second favorite of the slaw.  This is a must try restaurant if you are in NODA!",

We ordered the queso and it was a little thick for my liking. The tacos had great flavor. I was not a fan of the fried flour tortilla with them...I would prefer just a fresh tortilla. I was not impressed with my side (a rice with a mango salsa on top). My husband was also not too impressed with his garlic and jalapeno mashed potatoes. Definitely try the Wahoo Taco.  Great service. Would go back for the people and the atmosphere.   Check out the Women's Restroom....it had 2 toilets, side-by-side with no divider. It was a single room. Thought it was kinda odd!!!",

    "text": "I've been here before.. several times in fact, and the food has always been.. Ok.  Don't misunderstand, I read the other yelp reviews, I've seen that people love Cabo Fish Taco and I WANTED to love this place, I just didn't think it was anything special, passable sure, maybe even \"good\" but certainly not worth the 30 minute drive, it was just nothing special.  Until today.  We had a rare lunch w/o kids so were up for something a lil different.  Decided to try Jack Beagles as I'd heard good things but had never been.  As we pulled up we saw Cabo just next door and thought.. Better the devil you know, right?  So Cabo was the answer.  Got talking to our waiter (also the bartender as our table was next to the bar) and I mentioned that as much as I'd wanted to love Cabo, so far I'd been greatly underwhelmed and I asked for suggestions.  Immediately he suggested the Tavarua Tuna tacos.. And I regretted asking lol.  See, I don't do meat/fish with fruit.  Of any kind, ever.  I greatly dislike sweet and sour food combos, I don't like sweet elements in a savory dish.  Tavarua Taco has all of these elements - blackened, lemon rubbed wahoo (blackened=strike 1 for me) in a kiwi-pineapple marinade (strike 2) with a honey-wasabi sauce (definite strike 3 for me).  Grudgingly I ordered a Tavarua Taco along with my Carne Asada taco figuring at least I knew the steak would be ok as I've had it in the past.  In a word, WOW.  I started with the Tavarua Tuna and honestly, I'm not sure I've ever eaten anything tastier.  WOW.  I now know fully why people RAVE about this place.. If you've been unimpressed, I promise you're ordering wrong!  The GM came past our table to ask how we were enjoying our meal and I told him how..bland our past experiences were (I've always had either the carne Asada tacos or the beer battered fish tacos - and he agreed with me that it is fairly easy to get a better beer battered fish taco elsewhere, but that's not what they're about and often people are disappointed thinking the fried fish taco is a \"signature\" dish, when the reality is the fresh grilled fish and all the clean flavors are the star of the show.  Genuinely, I could eat there everyday - the Tuna was SO good that the Carne Asada taco afterwards felt like punishment, and I ended up leaving it and the side (spicy avocado pasta salad - tasty!) in favor of ordering and having the room to eat a second Tavarua taco.  Unbelievable yum.  We will be back.  We will be back often.  I will be getting the Tavarua tacos, you can bet on it :)",

Also had soup - chicken & jalapeno; also boring, though better when we added some of the corn relish and some bottled hot sauce. Everything needed salt - and more flavor.  And what's up with no salsa on the table, just a corn & tomato relish? Which was mostly corn.  My fish tacos are way better! Can't believe Guy Fieri liked this place - he usually has better taste. Won't go there again.",

My experience last was horrible, not the food but the service. I chopped it up to maybe that waitress had a bad day but I was still going to tell her manager. This past weekend, I connected with a friend there who really wanted to try it out and I put our name down for a table. They text you when your table is available. I realized I received a text msg 2 minutes earlier. We go in and the hostess is talking to someone with a red bull can in her hand about what I don't know but we waited for about 35 seconds (yes, I timed it) to finish talking.  I finally after about 10 more seconds, said \"Hey, we have a text, I think our table is available?\"The hostess looked at us, KEPT talking and turned back around. I say \"excuse me\" She says, \"Yes, I heard you but I'm talking to someone else\" AND SHE TURNS BACK AROUND. It was by the grace of God I didn't slap curse her out. I was about to leave however, my friend wanted to stay and someone immediately walked us to a table. All she could've done was acknowledge us if that convo was that important. I immediately called the manager, I think his name was Walter, who was very apologetic. Get this, he was already kind of aware of the situation and offered us a free appetizer. I declined it but my friend asked for queso but rest assured, I will NEVER go to that restaurant again. They just lost a faithful customer of 3 years who travels down to have a good time at that restaurant.",

SORRY,  I meant the \"CABO ROLLS\" that were filled with nothing but cheese and mayonnaise.  This set a bad tone for the rest of the experience.    I ordered the blackened Mahi tacos.   All of their signature tacos are \"finished with white cilantro sauce\" which did nothing to enhance the flavor and just made the whole thing soggy.  There was a low amount of cilantro accompanied with a low amount of flavor.    Under-seasoned and soggy are the only words to describe the tacos I had there.

    "text": "Cabo Fish Taco, in general, is a decent establishment. Although I have conflicting opinions on various food choices offered, the restaurant atmosphere usually makes up for any setback.   First off, the fish tacos... very well crafted. If you're a fan of fish tacos, you really can't go wrong with these. I've been out to this place about three times now and have come to realize it's a safe bet. My favorite (although I really haven't tried any others) is the Wasabi Fish Taco, which as you may have figured, has that perfect combination of sweet and spicy flavor. In my opinion, it is still on the mild side.  Now contrary to the fish tacos, are their burritos. Fail. These are basically meals you could easily put together yourself- wrap, a can of re-fried beans, mixed with some other ingredients that just don't make up for the overpowering sense of eating at a Taco Bell. Not that there is anything wrong with Taco Bell, but simply put, you are basically paying Cabo $10.29 for a near synonymous $.99 bean burrito from Taco Bell. And burrito size? Probably less than half of what you'd expect an authentic Mexican restaurant to serve you.   Lastly, atmosphere. The restaurant has a great layout and usually has a great crowd. Well decorated. The ambient noise can be a little much at times with the acoustics set up as such- a lot of hard wood, metal, etc.  Overall, I would REALLY rate a 3.5 if could. Ideally, if all your looking for is a place to go to have a few drinks with friends, get some food (knowing you want a fish taco, of course), this place is definitely worthy of your time.",

The fish tacos had no cabbage, cilantro, or lime, they were pretty lacking in general and were served with wilted green leaf lettuce. The black beans and rice had no flavor. The party at the table next to us had to send their meal back for being uncooked. It was just not a meal I would ever come back for.",

The corn salsa and chips they bring out while you wait for your food are great. I had the Lemon Grilled Tuna Tacos with Baja Rice. The tacos were filling and the rice was cooked well. The sauce that goes on top of the rice was really sweet as well. My sister got the Lemon Grilled Shrimp Tacos with black beans and rice. I'm not a fan of black beans, but I got myself a little bite of my sister's shrimp tacos and they were good.   I believe the next time we go, I'm definitely going to try the Beer Battered Shrimp Tacos! This is one place I will return to again and again.",

    "text": "What started out to be a great day ended in my going back to bed at 3:30PM.   After having such a wonderful experience at Shine with Mark, I decided to head over to NODA to check it out and to try something new, Cabo Fish Taco  So the place was packed, as expected from what I've read per previous reviews. I asked if there was a place at the bar since I was solo.   Headed to the bar and was ignored. Finally the grumpy and \"I'm too busy checking my iPhone\" bartender dude came over. He offered me a drink menu and I asked for the full food menu as well. He asked if I wanted chips and \"salsa\" .  As  I was looking over the drink menu, nothing really stood out, so I had the Souza something or other.. blah... boring, bland... stupid... why bother to order kind of drink - as it turned out. And not to mention it was served by a not so friendly bartender.   The chips were fine, but the corn-tomato salsa was DRY... it looks like they must pre-serve the bowls and let them sit until they are grabbed to be distributed. Salsa should be fresh, not dry.   Ok, then another person, brought over my lunch, I had ordered the lemon grilled shrimp taco with a steak taco and a side of re-fried beans as I, personally, dislike black beans. Strange I know, but I despise black beans.   The tortillas were warm, but the proteins cold. The cheddar cheese used on the steak tacos didn't even warm (and why would you put cheddar cheese on a steak taco?) The proteins were of good quality, but SERIOUSLY lacked any kind of flavor. I agree with Tanya R. -- white sauce, what white sauce? I asked if they had any other salsa's -- the dude looked at me like I was crazy. I said, you know hot sauces. He brought over Tapatio and Chula... ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? I said, \"No like salsa verde or rojo? Something else made in-house\" still he stood there blank and annoyed. I said something made in house... he went on to saying something with wasabe... What? WTH in a mex joint... I said forget it, please just bring out some more white sauce (which he charged me for). I put tapatio in in to help enhance it and to add heat.   The food was a big let down. The proteins were of good quality, lacked serious seasoning and were served cold. The re-fried beans were really weird tasting... sour almost, so I quit eating them in case there were bad.   I asked the to busy bartender after he finished checking his iPhone if the owners were from So Cal... he said I don't know... I just started here. REALLY you don't know shit about the restaurant you work in... WOW  And what put my experience over the top was they allow their wait staff to wear daisy dukes... one girl bent over and you could see up to a land you didn't want to observe...  The staff all seemed overwhelmed and too busy to care. Argh I hate grumpy staff. The \"good\" thing out of my experience there was this nice patron sitting next to me at the bar who complemented my shirt...   I doubt I'd ever return. I can't believe this next part is even going to come out of my mouth, but I so wish a Rubio's would come to Charlotte, I would so welcome this chain and their taco Tuesday's... The places I avoided back home is what I'd rather eat here. Sad, shaking my head I even typed that, but at this point, I'd die for one of their fish tacos with white sauce and their salsa verde...",

    "text": "I love seafood and Mexican food...naturally, Cabo Fish Taco was a delightful treat last night! This may have been my first time there but it definitely won't be my last. I wasn't surprised to find that Cabo was packed around 7:45p last night. They won't seat you unless your entire party is there so make sure to be on time if you are meeting someone.   We were seated right away and given this amazing corn salsa to start. I wasn't a fan of the chips, they were a little stale for my taste, but the corn salsa was crisp and refreshing. Definitely a step up from the tomato salsa you get at chain restaurants. I took V's recommendation and ordered the epic tuna burrito rare with a side of avocado pasta salad. I was tempted to order the beer battered salmon tacos but I'll save that for another Thursday. The bf got a beer battered shrimp taco and a chicken taco. I didn't mind the wait, we had corn salsa to keep us company.   Food came out, those tacos looked huge! I seriously have not seen tacos that stuffed, I definitely will be returning for those tacos now. The shrimp was tender on the inside and crunchy on the outside, as it should be. The epic tuna burrito is rightfully named with generous chunks of fresh tuna. I love sushi so I enjoyed the rare tuna. For all of you who don't normally eat seafood, its not fishy at all. The shrimp and fish were seasoned so well. That pasta salad, yum, soooo creamy. I am going to have to opt for this option for every meal at Cabo.   We are for sure coming back. I'll have to try a margarita next time. Cheers!",

I must admit I have not ventured too much away from tacos on the menu, but that's a good thing. They do tacos so well, I've tried them all and love them. The Mahi and tuna are my favorite. It can be a little costly, however I have never left here still hungry. Keep in mind this place can get packed so on a weekend night you'll probably have a wait. However, they use the service that can let you see where you are at in line and alert you when your table is ready. We like to use that time and have drinks or an appetizer next door at sabor.",

I prefer authentic Mexican food when I actually take the time to sit down or else I could've just went to chipotle or moe's. I remembered I hadn't been here in a while when in the area and now I remember why that is. I ordered a shrimp quesadilla which was extremely bland and I maybe took two bites before i stopped trying to force myself. It looked amazing but the taste did not match that all if anything all i tasted was cheese. Of course the table came with chips and corn salsa, but the corn salsa was absolutely disgusting(there was really nothing salsa about it). Our server was sweet which really helped out with our experience but I honestly don't see myself returning anytime soon maybe in another 5 years",

    "text": "Definately a must, especially if you are visiting Charlotte! The shrimp and crab dip is the BOMB! It can easily be shared with 2-4 people as an appetizer (or for 1 person it can be a meal). The shrimp and chicken burrito is my go-to order with the avocado pasta (which has some spice to it). Non-seafood options and veggie options are available and are also very good! The portion sizes of everything is reasonable/a lot for the prices. I always have to get a box to take home food. Beware of parking and be prepared to search, walk a little bit, and/or pay for parking in a lot a few blocks away. The staff are very friendly and helpful if you have questions about the menu. If you are able to find a spot at the bar to eat, take it! The restaurant is always full and busy, so be ready to put your name in and wait when you go, especially during meal times.",

I'm not really sure what the hype is about this place. I think it might just be the hipster place to eat in NoDa.   This not being my first time here but not coming in a long time (5 plus years since my last visit) these are the reasons I like Cabo Fish Taco: 1 - Consistently good food and drinks. These are the reasons I DON'T like Cabo Fish Taco: 1- Consistently a 30 minute wait 2- it's soooo loud.   On this visit I ordered the shrimp and chicken burrito and the spicy avocado pasta salad. I really enjoyed both items and thought they were worth the price. I also had the Azulita Rita with sugar rim and thought it was a great drink choice. Since I'm not a fan of fish  and think that tacos are overpriced unless they are a $1 special I quickly overlooked the taco options. However the only reason I was here this visit was because an out of town friend is in love with the BBQ Mahi taco. I tasted the fish and it was good but not anything to write home about.   I probably won't be back unless someone else just has to go. And if I want the meal I had again I will probably just order togo!",

Gina the manager didn't calm the situation she told me to leave without hearing both sides of the story in a instant, I'm experienced in management and have managed multiple restaurants in the past and hearing the customers part of the story is always important to me, GINA needs training on how to calm situations with a displeased customer and hearing both sides of the story before intervening , I won't be back to this poorly managed establishment.  We don't know the waitress's name but here initials are K.S",

It reminds me of Williamsburg. I don't recall that vibe last visit. The food is still really good. Service was fast and friendly.  The tacos are fresh and the crab dip is definitely worth the trip. I like being able to mix and match taco choices because I can't pick just one. Today I had blackened Mahi and lemon shrimp.  The corn salsa is really good also. I'm not a fan of the rice and beans because it's on the dry side and the rice was kinda hard. It gets loud as the place fills up. This place is a solid 4 stars.

I paired my food with a pomegranate margarita and it was very good. The staff was very nice and attentive to our needs. Overall, my experience at this establishment was very pleasant and they have a nice atmosphere. The only downside to this restaurant is the parking. Due to it being in the NoDa area, free parking is very limited however they have a paid parking lot near available. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "One of our favorite restaurants! We love the beer battered fish tacos, but we usually try something off their seasonal/ rotating menu. The flavors are so fresh and unique, definitely worth the try. Hands down, best queso I've ever had. You will gain a lot of weight your first time here because you'll want to drink that deviously delicious white cream sauce. I mean, this review should just say: Queso. Honestly the whole menu is amazing and fun to go to with a group so you can try a bit of everything. The free salsa they give you is unique and sweet!! The interior is unique and the service is usually very good. 5/5 on all areas!",

Note, very limited parking. Expect to drive around a bit and fight for street parking or a small fee for a parking lot. Free chips and spicy corn salsa was nice but chips are hard. Good find overall.",

What is cool is that it is in the heart of NODA so you can grab a drink some where else while waiting or walk around and get a look of the colorful artwork.   I am trying out vegan now so I was shocked at the options I did have for that lifestyle . . People who love guacamole! You found your new place to love guacamole!!  Now for non vegan people you need to try the fish tacos! Delicious!   The atmosphere is cool but a little small on the inside as this adds to the wait . It has a good word of mouth and some people go insane over this place and I understand why too. I have eaten at a lot places and I still recommend here all the time. Just be prepared to wait.",

The food was pretty good, though my Serrano taco was cold, it had a great flavor and my husband enjoyed the fish taco. The chips were stale (confirming other reviewers). Our service was very good.   The 3 stars is for the dangerous noise level in this place. 30 minutes at this level can cause damage to hearing. The workers in this place should wear protective ear coverings or the owner should take responsibility and protect their workers and patrons from the excessive noise.

    "text": "Cabo Fish Taco...you have been talked about and talked about from FoodNetwork to all-over-Charlotte.  I don't tend to veer towards baja-Mexican cuisine, but was with a group so Cabo it was...and I was excited to try because, well, simply said, I'm a tequila girl. I was ready to get my hands on a nice blanco on the rocks...until I didn't. Why? Because I couldn't.  I asked if they had cazadores? Nope. I looked quickly at the margarita menu since there wasn't a tequila menu (still scratching my head about this), and ended up with El Jimador, which I took approximately 2 1/2 sips out of because I couldn't do it. No no, I wasn't going to let this ruin my tequila.  The girls' tacos looked fabulous but I went with a salad for two reasons: 1. I don't love soft shells 2. gluten and corn-free. The options for dietary restrictions aren't terribly limited here, but they aren't great. Nothing on the menu is labeled, so you definitely need to mention to your server specifications. You very rarely hear me complain about cost in reviews, I'm fine with spending on quality, but I thought $7 upcharge to add chicken was VERY high so considering my salad was over $16.00 but their other salad that happens to have chicken on it costs $12.50 and the salmon salad was $13.95. Again, scratching my head.",

They added $40 to his tab when he had 2 tacos and one beer- his tab was over $70. They also told him he isn't allowed to eat there anymore. What assholes!

I am not a fish taco type of person, so that is somewhat important to my review. But, I am a food person, and flavors are a big part of what makes me decide if I LOVE something. I had two tacos, a steak taco, and a salmon taco. The salmon taco had a sauce that used horseradish as the main flavor, likely a good match for seafood. This taste, however, turns me off in general, making the taco get overpowered. The steak tacos was good, the steak a bit chewier than I would like, especially after the Carne Asada Fries from Sabor next door.  I'm sure that if I loved fish tacos, this would be my place!",

This place is casual, with a nice outdoor seating area, open via a garage door. The menu is full of margaritas, burritos, tacos, and drink specials. They have regular specials on Tecate and PBR, as well as food specials.  As far as the food goes, the standard salsa they bring is a corn and tomato based salsa that I really enjoyed. Unfortunately, the chips were slightly stale, but the salsa itself was solid. I ordered the grilled shrimp tacos and loved them. They have a nice aioli and the tortilla is buttery.   Given this place's spot on triple d, I was worried about commercialism the first time I visited, but I've been overall impressed by the food both times. Not a bad spot for casual drinks and good food.",

I decided to get the rice and beans as my side and my taste buds were dancing in my mouth. I also ordered the Pomegranate margarita and it was the perfect addition to this meal.

We got free chips and corn salsa to start and that was pretty good and a nice change from the regular tomato salsa. Our waiter also hooked us up with queso which tasted great. I got two tacos and they all come with a side (carne asada and tavarua tuna) and I decided on  their special jalapeno mashed potatoes that our waiter recommended as my side. The carne asada was a bit spicy but it was nothing special, there was too much going on. The tuna one was delicious and cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes were weird, I was not impressed because it was just mashed potatoes with jalapeno pieces on top. Overall I think it is definitely overhyped. The tacos are good but not the best I've had, the combinations are cool and more of a go for the atmosphere place.",

    "text": "I like going to Cabo when I'm in the Charlotte area.. the food has always been great. I decided to go today, taking a friend who had never been there and the food was horrible! I was very surprised & disappointed. Food had no taste, the salsa tasted like it came straight out of a jar. I sent my side back, refried beans; and my friend did not eats hers, the black beans & rice. Both were tasteless! Adding a whole lot of hot sauce didn't make a difference in taste. Tacos were just ok. Basic tacos - nothing to brag about. I don't know what happened but I won't be going back.",

    "text": "The tacos are really good.  The menu regulars and special tacos a like.  My favorites are the tuna tavarua and the honey soy salmon.  They have a corn based salsa with their chips that isn't my favorite.  The guacamole is way below the bar, especially for a taco place, one of the worst in the city.  The mexi-slaw is decent but I only get that side because the rest aren't very good either.  They make up for everything else with the tacos which is why everyone goes there.         The restaurant itself is pretty large and has a porch like outdoor seating area in the front.  They can open up the large clear walls on nice days too.  I would plan on putting your name in and  grabbing a drink in the neighborhood while you wait for your table.  There is almost always a long wait but I live so close I usually get takeout which is super easy.        ***  I live in the middle of NODA and have been everywhere in the neighborhood many times over the past years. These reviews are a culmination of lots of visits so it's more of a consistency rating than anything.  If you are going out in NODA I've got reviews up of all the places in the neighborhood if you're looking to compare.  ***",

Refried beans were bland, the avocado pasta salad was warm and weird, also not much flavor. The queso was delicious, but the chips were thick, yellow, and cold. Just not my favorite style of chips. The corn salsa they serve with their chips was also very bland. I won't be coming back.",

Not too long of a wait and I like that they just text you instead of one of those vibrating things. The chips and salsa were good and free is always nice. You can get fresh guacamole too if you want. Started with the crab dip. We loved cheesy with warm pita.a winner for sure I had the tuna tacos and it was perfectly med rare withe spicy wasabi sauce. Big chunks . I ordered two but could only eat one.  My friend got the lemon shrimp tacos and she said the shrimp were sweet , tender and not over cooked. Again a winner The avocado pasta salad make you think your in a modern era and not in granny's kitchen. The parking can be tough because it's on the street but we figured we just had to walk off all that food This is a good place to bring out of town guests and or big groups.",

    "text": "Best fish tacos I've had so far! Stopped by because of the place being featured on DDD. They get you in and out quick. Food isn't a long wait at all.   Got a silver surfer margarita and they have some other specialty margaritas. Husband got a lonerider shotgun Betty and really liked it.   Ordered the BBQ mahi mahi fish tacos which was featured in DDD. I've never had BBQ on fish tacos but it goes so well. The sauce is homemade and the soft tortilla is too! It was the first thing we noticed when the tacos arrived. I wish every taco place had these homemade soft tortillas. I could just smack on those alone.  Husband ordered the blackened mahi mahi and he enjoyed that as well. You get two tacos so we swapped one. He got the spicy avocado pasta salad as a side and it was delicious. It's really not spicy at all.   If we lived in Charlotte we would definitely be coming back. There's no parking lot so you'll have to find street parking. You will not be disappointed with the fish tacos. Almost everyone in the restaurant was ordering them. Also featured on the show was the tuna wasabi burrito. I saw someone order that and it looked yummy as well. Another unique part is the corn salsa they give you to snack on. It's got a slight kick and it's just tomatos and corn with chips.   I just wanna go back and try everything off the menu!",

Cabo Fish Taco was great for the large group I had. Decent, attentive service and overall the food was really good.  I ordered the tuna taco, carne asada taco, and the avocado pasta salad.  The tuna was a bit too salty, and my tortillas were pretty greasy, but overall I really enjoyed all of the big flavors (and huge portions). I definitely recommend checking this place out if you want a cheaper meal that doesn't skimp on the food or the taste.  And the house margaritas are pretty good, too!",

Ordered the Jerk Grouper taco with a mango & misc salsa (there was other stuff in the salsa but mango was the king) which was freaking amazing. You get 2 huge soft tacos with a side which I got the avocado salad which is a pasta also freaking amazing . Cabo gives a very laid back vibe and the atmosphere has a Caribbean feel and tons of unique art which includes Bob Marley (4/20 ). The rice and beans as a side were also tasty so I recommend those as well.  Our waitress was very attentive and thank goodness cause that jerk snuck up on me and slapped me like 3 times lol but it was worth it.   The only thing missing from Cabo is a live band, group of friends and some libations lol.",

Im sure plenty of people would appreciate the strong margaritas and people who like flavorful salty food would love it. I probably woulda really liked it in my early 20s. The waitress was super nice and we had absolutely no issues with the service. The inside is loud but if you do outdoor seating, it's not so loud. It does take a while to be seated but they text you when your table is ready so you can go for a walk or something.",

The pricing is decent and the atmosphere is very chill. NODA is an art district so when the weather is fair I encourage you to walk around and explore the different shops in the area. I have been to Cabo Fish Taco about 4 times in the past year. Each time I go I get the same exact thing. The salmon taco is just so note worthy that I can't pass it up. It's so good that I have even ordered me a second meal to go. There is a pay parking lot directly beside the restaurant but parking is usually available on the street for free, you would just have to walk a short distance to get to the restaurant. The staff here are very friendly and helpful as well. If you are in the NODA district I encourage you to drop in to Cabo Fish Taco and check out what they have to offer.",

My sister ordered the Rasta pasta, which is chicken and shrimp pasta with a pineapple cream sauce! It was different yet good because the pineapple isn't too over powering and it's something different to try. I definitely recommend the salmon taco! It was sooo good. As an appetizer we got the shrimp and crab dip. It came with pita triangles that were soft and seasoned to perfection. The food alone is a reason to go and the service matched.

I don't give 5 stars for this reason, I just wish there was a Taco that was just not so spicy. When they say it's not spicy, it still hurt me- (BBQ mahi taco, fantastic) but I have to disclose I have an incredibly low spice tolerance. Even though it was spicy (for me, and I stress that) I could taste such amazing blends of flavors, and the quantity of meat and fun in the taco is more the size of a burrito, so don't shy from the price. Too it all off with friendly, likable, helpful staff. Love you Cabo Fish Taco, please give me one.. \"sweet\" fish taco, you know what I mean.. maybe a sweetish slaw, advocado cilantro something.. any space with so much attention to detail could give me one not too spicy dish.",

We got there at a perfect time. Sometimes  the line can be long. The Banana Cheese Cake was perfect.  Over all I will go back to try more of the menu.",

So last Saturday I tried this place for the first time after hearing all these great things about it from friends, and it definitely lived up to my expectations. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!   I've had the lemon grilled tuna and grilled salmon tacos, they were both great, but the salmon one was to die for! The cilantro white sauce really perfects the dish! You also get a side with the order as well; I chose fruit cup to be a little on the healthy side. I thought 2 tacos wasn't going to be enough for me because I have such a big appetite, but it was very filling. Good portion size!   This is definitely a place to check out. I want to go there again very very soon!",

I went today and my food was just so-so (everything we ordered) and it's not the first time.   This place is awesome.  A lot of creative choices other than just fish tacos too - my favorite being the Carne Asada tacos.  The price's are reasonable and the atmosphere is pretty chill and down to earth - but nothing special.  I don't think it matters - if you're like me you come here for the food and to have a few brews while hanging out in the NODA area.    So what's holding me back from giving 5 stars?  I'm not factoring in atmosphere, meal presentation, etc because this isn't that kind of place.  And the price's reflect that.  So purely based on food - the sides are very average. The chips and salsa are OK (although complimentary as in most mex-american joints).  And while the main entrees are definetely tasty, they're not \"out of this world\" good.  Still, I'm always up for some Cabo Fish Taco and they get a solid 4 stars.",

They have two bars, one in front, one in the other side of the restaurant.  The place was very busy, and pretty loud.  That's fine, it's just that kind of place.  The sidewalk patio seating looked GREAT but, it was full so, I couldn't enjoy the people watching.  I ordered the special, based on recommendation from the bar tender, the Tuna Wrap.  It was basically a tuna sandwich in a tortilla....sounds lame  but, it wasn't.  the Tuna salad was very nicely spiced and the wrap was quite good.  Very generous portion but, I was hungry!!! what could I do?  I ate the whole darn thing (oink oink)  The beer selection was nice, with a variety of local brews, as well as commercial taps and specialty beers.  Service at the bar was good.  The bartender was VERY experienced and knew what he was doing.  Friendly, good at small talk but, not annoying and bothering too much.  The ambiance....meh.  Take it or leave it.  Too \"themed\" for my own tastes but, that's just the kind of place it is.  I would definitely come here again, especially with friends for dinner before night on the town  Hint:  Plan on waiting if you come at peak times...the place was very busy during dinner, as well as lunch when I strolled by earlier in the day.  Not sure if they take reservations....worth a call to find out.",

    "text": "Two and a half stars, Ok but not so great.  Another Sunday fighting the crowds at Ikea - I recently bought two complete kitchens from them what a Pita!! - from there to the nearest home depot. I'm rarely at that end of town so I ask the young man behind the counter what's a good place for brunch in NODA and he says .... Cabo Fish taco.  Great idea!   We get there about 2:30, the place is busy but not unmanageable. Mexico and Marley theme joint, my partner asked if it was a part of a chain. Told her, no but it wants to be. We get a table immediately, the waitress is very friendly and attentive, although the bar was slow getting the drinks out.   - Salsa and chips. Boooring, the corn heavy but too light on onions and spice mixture is no salsa and chips are cardboardy - I'd be surprised if they're not packaged.   -The skinny Margarita got two thumbs down but I was cozy with my Negra modelo.   - Mahi taco .. with tangy bbq sauce? The sauce was tasty but out of place, it overpowered the whole dish. Mahi, which in Fla we usually call dolphin is a strong tasting fish that can even be served blackened and it's flavor will still come through. Here it was so bland it could have been a chicken. It wasn't bad but the mahi taco tasted like bbq chicken taco so I'd call that a fail. My companion said she would have liked it if it hadn't been for the sauce , not me.  - Honey wasabi Tuna wrap, hu menu says burrito. Exact same result, wasabi/honey is the only flavor that came through and the wasabi tasted more like sharp yellow mustard than like wasabi.  And I'm a wasabi eater, at home I even use it on cold chicken or cold roast beef.  Tuna, unlike mahi is easy to overpower but still that was another honey/mustard chicken wrap not a fish burrito.  The refried beans and the mashed potatoes with jalapenos were the best thing of the whole meal. Price was reasonable. Would I go back? No, it wasn't bad but the food was Charlotte-grade boring.",

They changed their menu around recently and the newly added carne asada taco is great--tender, juicy steak with nice chunks of jalapeno for some kick. The side dishes are inconsistent, but at their worst are pretty good. The only negative is that sometimes dishes can be a little sweet and... cinnamon-y? Especially the corn salsa and refried beans.  The service is laid-back and can occasionally be sloppy. At times, it seems like the staff can't handle big crowds, which is inexcusable for a restaurant that's consistently packed-with-waiting-list on Friday and Saturday nights.",

    "text": "I feel guilty that I have never reviewed Cabo Fish Taco before because it is my favorite place! I love this place and I always take people here when they come to visit. My favorites are the BBQ mahi tacos, lemon grilled shrimp tacos and the mahi maui burrito but you really can't go wrong here. My fiance loves the rasta pasta. The guacamole is also delicious. The only thing that is sometimes a downside to this place is that it can get really loud in the restaurant which makes it hard to talk at dinner. Also, since it is so tasty, sometimes you have to wait awhile for a table. But it is SO worth it!",

Mine came with lightly battered & fried shrimp, tomatoes, guacamole, shredded cheese, shredded cabbage (coleslaw style, minus the dressing), and a delicious white sauce on a house-made, slightly crispy white flour tortilla.   The rice was slightly overcooked and the beans slightly under, without much flavor. Also, they serve chips with a mixture of corn, tomato, cilantro & lime juice which is particularly hard to eat. Salsa would've been nice...  Go for the tacos - they got the name right.",

The location is great as it is in a great urban neighborhood called NoDa.  However I was greatly disappointed in the tacos.  Everyone raved about the tavaroo ones but pineapple on it just did not work for me  I also had the blackened mahi, which was better but the cilantro crema was too mild.  The salsa served with drinks was bland and dry with corn and tomatoes.  Garbanzos in the side dish??  I believe in creative cuisine but the food just was so far off from its Baja theme and was too bland for my taste.  Margarita menu interesting and varied with a great selection of tequilas.  Service was excellent.",

The waitress was super nice and the food came out quickly.   But it didn't make up for the so-so tacos.    My daughter had the fajitas which had way too much soy sauce, very salty.  So sad.

The salsa here wasn't as great as the one back at school but everything else was pretty much on par to the other location. We sat at the bar at this place was packed for a late lunch on Sunday.

Service was great, it was my waitress' first night on the job and she did wonderful!  I tried the bbq mahi taco and a blackened mahi taco. The Bbq mahi was better by far, not sweet, but a little tangy, it was amazing. After the bbq mahi my blackened mahi taco seemed a little plain jane. Also the flour tortillas were so unique , they were fluffy and reminded me slightly of Indian fry bread. They were so good and made it much easier to hold/eat the hearty tacos!  I also tried a skimny margarita in the rocks, which was yummy and paired great with the tacos.   I would definitely go back, I was told after I ordered that the calamari tacos are delicious as well, so that's what I want to try next!",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place, but I don't know what I was thinking; after crappy Mexican food the night before, I thought I could get good tacos in the south?  Either we were there on a REALLLY off day, or the people who eat here have not had good tacos/Mexican food.  I will say, however, the service was excellent and the iced tea was tasty and my glass kept filled.  I was tempted to go an extra star for the service, but I just can't.  The food.  Meh...  First, the chips and salsa.  Actually, the corn and tomato salsa was probably the best thing I had here - very interesting, but the chips were awful  Completely stale.  Oh, I ate them... I was hungry, but STALE.  I ordered the lemon grilled shrimp taco (sounds amazing, right?) but asked them to make it with the standard accompaniments (cabbage versus mixed greens).  The husband had fajitas.  My taco was fine.  I thought it was weird that it had cheese on it... I mean, it's shrimp so cheese is weird, but I picked most of it off.  The shrimp was good, the tortilla was meh, that cabbage was not crisp.  It came with beans and rice.  I don't eat beans so gave those to the husband.  He who loves the beans left them there without touching them after tasting his own beans.  That was a first.  The rice had something weird in it for a Mexican rice - I'm pretty sure it was Thyme.  Never heard of Thyme rice with tacos.  Cilantro?  Yeah.  Thyme?  Not so much.  After eating my tacos, I said, \"well, what was I thinking trying a second time for Mexican food?\"  The husband replied, \"yours wasn't good either?\"  So there's that.  I've NEVER heard him say he didn't like ANY Mexican food.  He's like a vacuum, especially for the Mexican food.... NOT picky.  I feel bad dinging this place, but it was such a huge disappointment.  What surprises me is how much people love this place and even more that a Cali boy like Guy Fieri put this place on his show and raved about it.  Again, maybe it was an off day while we were there, but I just don't get it.  I cannot recommend this place.  Wait until you get to Cali or heck, even New Mexico before going for tacos.",

The second time I returned and got the BBQ Mahi tacos because I liked them so much. Ended up bringing enough food home from our table that I had two other meals (brought home two tacos). This week I was there on Thursday night and we had just beat the crowd. They had 1/2 off NC Draft beers which was awesome! I will definitely return again soon!",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try this place really badly - as a DDD restaurant and the fact that there is almost always a line out the door, it seemed like a solid choice.   My boyfriend and I went at about 1:45p on a Saturday afternoon and it was only a 10min wait. Not too shabby!  We loved the lemon grilled tuna tacos, original margarita, and queso that we split. The queso almost tasted like a beer cheese, just had a more savory flavor than I'm used to I guess. The margarita was really interesting, you'd get the typical citrus/sour mix flavors at first then it had a really sweet after taste - I'm pretty sure I couldn't drink more than two without getting a massive hangover. And the tacos were out of this world - definitely the star of the show - and there were a handful of other types we want to try in the future that I'm confident are equally as good.   My only qualms are: (1) the chips and salsa they serve the table are a unique twist. Instead of making a standard tomato based salsa they serve the tortillas with a corn salsa. This is just a personal preference, but I don't want corn salsa (with close to nothing else but corn in it) with corn chips. Hence the queso move... (2) our server missed part of our order. Granted it was loud, I mumble, and one order of tacos plus a side plus queso was enough to fill us up. But still, he wrote down the first and third things I ordered. Confused on what happened there in the middle.   BUT, we will definitely be back!",

I've also noticed that the quality has been steadily declining over a he years. I used to really like it but now it's squarely in 'just ok' territory with me.   Some of the tacos are good but some are of iffy quality. The crane asada tacos used to be my go to but last time I had then, the meat was incredibly tough. They're seasoned well but that doesn't matter much when the meat is the consistency of a shoe. The tuna isn't fresh tasting so I'd avoid that too. The fried fish tacos and the Mahi tacos are decent.  One of my biggest complaints about this place is the unreasonable prices. Not only are the tacos way overpriced but they also charge five bucks for the tomatillo salsa then don't give refills! The house salsa is free but it's disgusting. I love the tomatillo salsa but I use a lot of salsa and I don't expect to pay ten dollars for salsa alone!  The atmosphere of this place is really fun but the food quality just doesn't measure up to the price tag or the ridiculously long waits. I guess in Noda, you can get away with skewed price to quality ratios since the twenty year old hipsters will flock to you regardless!",

The spicy pasta salad was okay.   4.5 stars but rounded down for the waiter. Our server was kind of rude when my mom asked what the spicy pasta salad was. His response: exactly what it says it is...spicy pasta salad. He clearly had an attitude and did not smirk or smile when he said it. And then when my mom  (taken aback) said oh ok... so its pasta and spices? The guy then rattles of a laundry list of ingredients including pasta cheese jalapenos etc etc. Clearly it wasn't \"exactly what it said it was\". He could have been friendlier overall. Rest of staff was great!",

This review doesn't need to be long because all I really need to tell you is go and try this food because you will simply see for yourself what I'm talking about.  But the real winner of this place is by far the lightly fried taco shells. I truly have never tasted anything like them before. They're not crunchy tacos and they're not soft tacos, they are something completely new. It's what keeps coming back for more each week.  And please do try their crab dip, the fried pitas it served with will also make you want more.",

I spent $75 on the worst dinner ever, and am sad I can't get my money back for such a waste.   The waiter we had, Matt, was the absolute worst. I manage a restaurant, and I've been a server... He should not be serving.  And the most important part - my food was SO bland and weird - (carrots and zucchini and other veggies in a fried taco bowl?) so I said I didn't like the food, but that im willing to pay for it and just take it home, and that I can order something else.. Matt didn't apologize, or even care to ask how he can make it better. I ordered another meal, which was my third entree (including my boyfriends) and ended up paying the $75.   It was my boyfriends birthday... The only thing he enjoyed was the $2.75 buckshots.  All around - Horrible horrible horrible horrible, and even more horrible.",

First off, the chips, salsa, and queso. The chips were stale, the corn salsa was nothing more than underripe tomato chunks and corn (no seasoning whatsoever), and the queso was quite clearly microwaved velveeta. Not a good start.   For entrees, we split the specialty tuna and bbq mahi tacos. Both were one-note and heavy-handed on the sauces. Requested tuna medium rare, but received overcooked tuna. Way too much wasabi on the tuna--not too spicy, it just overpowered every other flavor. Bbq sauce was incredibly sweet and drowned out the flavor of fresh, well prepared mahi. Rice and beans on the side were flavorless.   Maybe this is what constitutes a good restaurant in Charlotte. I certainly hope not.",

These are equally delicious! The chips & corn salsa are yummy too; however, sometimes the chips are soggy, so be careful of that, Margaritas, even the \"el cheapo' are very refreshing...& like the name says, \"cheap\"! :D",

The fish was bland and not particularly anything to write home about.  I had the chicken tacos which were so watery that the tortilla they came on was soggy, damp and crumbling apart before it even reached my table. That should've been my first sign.  There must have been an entire handful of chives in the tacos. I ended up having to spend five minutes picking enough out so I could actually taste the meat.  Anyway, I ate a good portion of the tacos and began feeling sick about 45 minutes later. Spent the next two days in bed feeling miserable.  I will never go back here.",

I've been coming here for years and even used to frequent the other location in Blacksburg, VA. Where's Cabo's menu isn't s strong point for my taste, it's a great spot for a few margs, decent fish tacos, and perfect for street-side seating in the summertime.   *Sigh*...the menu. Some of the items here just don't really push past the point of being worth the dollars. Believe me, the blackened tuna or mahi tacos are great. Love the slaw, the tortillas work well, they are piled high with goodies, and the flavors abound...but the rest of the plate? No thanks, brosef. The sides are ever-so lackluster. Jalapeno mashers? Ick. They never end up coming out right. Also, every time I've ordered a side of beans, I regret it. Also, for the veggie-lover, DON'T order the veggie burrito. The addition of zucchini and yellow squash inside the tortilla is an atrocity. But hey, if the sides are the worst part of their game, I think they are doing just fine for a NoDa staple.   Also, be prepared to wait on a Friday or Saturday night. The addition they have on the patio is awesome in the spring or summer. If you have a large group, you might end up with at least an hour wait on a busy night. I'm privy to heading here for lunch. Much more accessible.   Cabo, you are welcome in my book. I'm not a huge fan of your side items, but your space is killer and I'm a sucker for fish tacos. Cheers!",

We went last week while in town for a concert and it just wasn't the same.  This time, we went on a weekday afternoon around lunchtime.  The corn salad stuff they brought out kinda looked like it had been sitting around for a while and the chips tasted stale.   I ordered the battered fish tacos and hubs ordered the carne asada.  The tortillas had the texture you get when you nuke them for too long - rubbery - and rubbery tortillas sincerely bum me out, man.  The carne and the fish were good, though, I could've eaten those elements all day.  I had rice and beans on the side, which was terrible, but hubs had pasta salad, which was really good.  It has its ups and downs now, I suppose.  Good service and cool atmosphere, though.",

    "text": "I have to say that this was one of the biggest disappointments I've had in a restaurant. I had seen Cabo on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and couldn't wait to try it. I do not live in Charlotte any longer but was in town to visit relatives for the holidays so this was kind of a destination. The NoDa section is very much out of the way but it is a neat area with what they have done with it. There were 3 of us eating so we had a chance to taste a few different things. First of all they were jam packed which was a good sign but resulted in terrible service. We sat for about 5 minutes before anyone said hello and finally Pete showed up. He was friendly enough and took our drink orders. I had an IPA on tap and another one of us had the Original Cabo Margarita. The beer was great but the margarita was the worst margarita ever served. We asked for the margarita to be served \"up\" (no ice) and what showed up was a glass full of tequila and triple sec, no mixer what so ever. We asked Pete about this and he said he told the bartender that it was supposed to be served straight up and he guessed the bartender took that to mean just the liquor. Anyway Pete took it back and had them add the mixer and it really wasn't any better. As far as lunch was concerned, I ordered a bowl of seafood chowder and the blackened Mahi Mahi tacos with a side of black beans and rice. My wife ordered the battered white fish tacos with a fruit side and my brother ordered the battered white fish tacos with a side of mashers (mashed potatoes). A few minutes later our lunch was served. They forgot to bring my seafood chowder and instead of bringing me black beans and rice they served me mashers ( I didn't bother to say anything). My tacos were okay. The tortillas that they were served on were very good, the accouterments served on the taco were bland and virtually tasteless and the mashers were okay. I told them to just forget the seafood chowder. I also had one of the battered white fish tacos and they were tasteless as well. The fruit side was good. Our billed was $47.80 + gratuity which would have been fine if the food had been decent. Overall I would not recommend this restaurant and I definitely will not return. Charlotte has way too many good places to eat without wasting time and money here.",

Every time I've eaten there recently it's terrible. Cold sides, stale chips, fish not fresh... Recently I got the veggie fajitas. I'm still gagging thinking about it. Tastes like old Chinese food (yeah,not Mexican) that had been sitting in a styrofoam box in the fridge for a week then heated up in the microwave. It was so gross. I didn't finish it. So last week I went there (why? Not sure) and I got a simple vegetable wrap with some ranch sauce and a side of fruit. The fruit tasted fine, not freshly cut but maybe like pre cut my Harris teeter or something. Anyway I started feeling an upset stomach after the first part of the wrap. I boxed the other half and took it home. I tried to finish it at home and within 30 minutes I was projectile vomiting. It lasted the entire day. I threw up around 25 times that day. I have never felt so sick. That food was the first and only thing I ate that day and I never ever throw up usually. I couldn't keep anything down the entire day, not even water or medicine, I felt like dying and that wrap poisoned me! Definitely my last experience at cabo will be connected with some brutal food poisoning memories. Ew",

    "text": "Food is good. Drinks are good. Expanded restaurant means that the waits are much shorter than they used to be. Seems cliche but the fish tacos are the way to go here. House margaritas are delicious and inexpensive (they also have an El Cheapo Marg that I think is only $3), but the house is way better and still a bargain at $5. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Cute decor but looks can be deceiving. The mahi-mahi & tuna in the tacos smelled and tasted \"fishy\"- not a good sign. Over seasoned, dry rice & beans...I sent my meal back (the wife had paprika halibut which was very good) but found I was still being charged for it when the bill was presented. I was put in the position of telling my pleasant but clueless waiter that I shouldn't have to pay for a meal returned to the kitchen and asked for the manager, who came to the table to tell me that my dish had been \"comped\" after having tried to charge for it. Hello!? 1 star for food. minus 2 stars for customer service.",

    "text": "My friends and I arrived at 6:00pm on a Friday and the place was nearly filled, but luckily we were seated after arrival. The waitstaff checked up on the table frequently and brought more chips and corn salsa once we were out. Chips were salted and the ingredients in the corn salsa were fresh, however,  the salsa was spiceless. We ordered guacamole for the table and it was good, also not spicy. I expected my tuna burrito to be pretty bland judging from the corn salsa and the guacamole, but the cilantro sauce added the spiciness I was after. The tuna was delicious! I also had the Cheapo margarita and that was very smooth.",

    "text": "Let me say first of all  that I'm writing this review with a heavy heart, but I feel the need to be honest.  I have eaten at Cabo Fish Taco a few times before and I have usually really enjoyed the Baja fish tacos and margaritas.  This time, however, was not the same.  The corn salsa was bland and room temperature. The Baja fish tacos were just not good...that's all I can say.  The typically long, crunchy strips of cabbage were replaced with mealy mush that I guess was supposed to pass for some kind of coleslaw and the usually large buttery avocado chunks on top gave way to a sad little spoonful of browning guac at the bottom.  The fish was super fishy and not in a good way.  I always get the nopalitos salad because I'm obsessed with pickled cactus, but this time I found one slice of cactus amongst an entire bowl of bland black beans and chickpeas.  My boyfriend's Rasta Pasta came without shrimp because they were out (wtf??? no shrimp in a seafood restaurant??) and the sauce/chicken had way too much jerk seasoning that overwhelmed the other flavors like peppers and pineapple.  Our waitress was crazy busy and overlooked our empty drinks more than once, then let us sit for 15 minutes while she attempted to settle our tab.  The margaritas, I will say, were strong and tasty...just like I like 'em.  All in all, I was exceedingly underwhelmed and disappointed that the food has gone so far downhill.  Perhaps the biggest kicker of them all....it was my birthday.  Booooooooo.",

Everything here seems to be so heavy, so when I found light refreshing Mexican with a flair I was thrilled!! Plus Noda is such an interesting neighborhood to visit! By far my favorite Mexican spot in the city. And the margarita's aren't too shabby either.",

    "text": "I went on a Thursday night at about 7 so I expect to wait a little. The problem with that is, there is NO place to wait. the doorway was so crowded the hostest couldn't get to the people that had been waiting. Also people that were waiting in the bar overflowed into the tables of people eating. Once I sat down, we were in a an overflowed table. It was weird to eat with people's rears in your face.  The salsa was great. All the ingredients were fresh and delicious. I wish the chips were hot, like they are at other tex-mex restaurants. The meal I ordered was a burrito Verde (I don't eat fish). It was not really that good, the veggies didn't really go together. It tasted like they just took every veggie in the kitchen and threw it in there. I would not order this again.  The service was also not so great. I went in with three other girls and when we asked for our check to be separate we got some attitude. My water glass was empty about half the time.  Overall if I went on an off night (which from the other reviews doesn't seem like there is one and ordered something different it would be OK.",

    "text": "the best part of this meal was the salsa and chips.  Service sucked we waited a good ten minutes before anyone came to our table after being seated, and it wasn't busy. Guacamole was missing something just didn't taste like guac- it was missing something, but not sure what.  My salad was not very good, The veggies were cut to thick, and obviously cut way earlier in the day as they were starting to wilt. Any of the seeds that the wrote about on the menu were obviously plated first as they weren't seen until the end. Chicken was suppose to be spicy- it was bland although cooked decently.  The fish taco that my wife had was disappointing and lack luster.  It was very uninspired, the blackened mahi mahi was well not blacked the cheese was just kinda there the only redeeming part of it was a white cilantro sauce.   Overall food would be a 2 but service is a 1.  that combo wont be bring me back.",

    "text": "Had lunch here with some team members today, after seeing the Diners, Drive-ins and Dives episode.  It is in the art district of North Charlotte, also called No Da for North Davidson.  The seating area was pretty large and we did not have to wait to be seated.  The service was good as well.  They brought out some chips with a corn-based salsa which was pretty good, with a slight bite to it but the chips were pretty sad, like they had been laying around for a while...definitely not crisp.  We all ordered the fish tacos, with several of us choosing the blackened Mahi Mahi. Our plates arrived within about 15 minutes, which did not seem too long and the tacos were really good.  I had a side of jalapeno mashed potatoes and they were not very warm but they tasted good.  Overall, we all thought the lunch experience was great and the tacos were great also.  We will be returning to Cabo Fish Taco again for sure.",
