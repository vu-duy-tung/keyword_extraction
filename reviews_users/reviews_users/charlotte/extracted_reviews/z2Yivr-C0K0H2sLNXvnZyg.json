They had just run out of their pork (which she told me hardly ever happens - lucky me lol) so we didn't get to try it but had the chicken & ribs. They were really great. The real winners were their onion rings that are made on the spot & the jalapeno slaw which was such s great departure from the usual. All in all such a great place. Oh and their BBQ sauces 4 different flavors were all good too.   We took advantage of the checkin coupon and save 10%! We would definitely make a point to stop back in soon!",

Pulled pork - It wasn't the best I've had but not the worst.  Creamed corn - Tasty side to balance out the salty brisket.  Mac & cheese - It was ok, but needed seasoning and salt.  Hushpuppies - I loved them but my wife didn't like the salty/sweet combination with sugar dusting on a regular hushpuppy.  Slaws - Best slaw we've had. The jalapeno slaw had pickled and fresh jalapeno, plus banana peppers. The BBQ slaw was yummy and had a great balance.  Since the brisket was inedible, we will never go back.",

The hush puppies were bland, over cooked, and had been sitting for quite a while before they were thrown on my plate- one landing in my brunswick stew.  The slaw was sadly the high point, but was a meager 2 tablespoons.  The stew was ok, but only after adding copious amounts of sauce.   The veggies in the stew seemed to be frozen processed junk.  There are more references to god than at a Catholic funeral.  The Jesus music is so loud, the plates rattle.  The church- like religious messages did not prevent alcohol from being served.  Their God clearly thinks alcohol is not a problem to sell.",

The girl who took our order I think it was her first day, I knew the menu (from reading it online) better than she did.  She keep getting my order wrong, I ordered the WIT hot cakes and the Brisket Plate Breakfast.  She was overwhelmed with taking orders it was after 1 on a Saturday and there was a line, she was answering calls, taking orders (poorly) and running food.    I could barely read the menu, after she gave me the wrong one for brunch, she could have said there is a large one on the wall behind you...she did not, clearly stated we wanted the Brisket Plate Breakfast she punched in Brisket Sandwich (thankful she asked if we wanted coleslaw with that)    We got our food some was luke warm, some cold, some hot. I was really looking forward to the brisket (luke warm) over cooked (dark meat not red), no smoke on the outer part of the meat (no bark). So disappointed.  WIT hot cakes were okay, very sweet (get milk or drink water - not that great with a soft drink)  large cut potatoes (not home fries) eggs were pretty good over easy, the puppies w/honey were bigger than a golf ball and as hard as one too, not cooked all the way in the middle (not good) - terrible sweet tea - changed to fountain cheerwine  I really wanted to like this place, i have been asking to go there for 3 months, glad I paid, I apologized all the way home for the experience",

I have never had something as greasy as pork be so dry so I had to use ample bbq sauce with they have a few flavors that are ok. My favorite was probably the turkey although my sister said her burger was very good.    So this place is close and could probably be a decent burger joint but they nickle and dime you for any extra toppings and \"premium\" sides. Since when are fries premium?     I tried the tacos they were different not bad but not great either and again with the nickle and dime for any toppings. The set up is not designed very well. The only full menu is right at the register and there is often a crowd trying to see what they want to eat so it can take some time to even be able to order. They started using wooden utensils also with do not work well.   The brunch is pretty good I will say though. The griddle cakes are great but I didn't really care for some of their specialty breakfast plates.   But the last visit will be the last time I will be eating there.  Right after paying for my meal my wife points to the wall where the bottle cap remover is and there is a roach. Not a palmeto bug but a nasty german roach in the middle of the day climbing up the wall. I realize this type of thing can happen at restaurants but this place is far to pricey to have roaches climbing up the wall in plain view. Talk about an appetite killer.",

The ribs were the only thing we go that was hot. They were ok. Actually the best thing we had.   On top of everything, $40! $40 for a BBQ plate, 1/2 rack of ribs, a sandwich and 1 beer!?!? I guess I expect to much. Maybe I should lower my standards and not be disappointed.  Nah, I love GOOD food and will gladly pay for it. But I really don't get 4+ stars here. I guess Belmont doesn't have much to compare it too.",

I also went ahead and got a side of biscuits and chorizo gravy for the table to share. The chorizo gravy was definitely the star of the entire meal but the pulled pork was a close second. The food was filling, tasted great and reasonably priced. Great value all around. Also, be sure and try their honey butter here. I've had honey butter many times before but theirs was so good we had to go back for seconds after everyone gobbled up our first side serving(s). I was also able to grab a couple bites off of our friends carolina hotcakes and they were uniquely tasty as well. Maybe a little heavy on the \"sweet\" side but that's never been a problem for me. The only thing I can say that is bad about this place is that the seating are is tiny and I do mean tiny. It probably seats a couple dozen people max.",

NO SMOKE SMELL!  Actually No smoke flavor at all in the BBQ.  I suspect electric smokers which to me is not real BBQ.  The onion rings were good.  Adding a few Jalapenos to the top of the cole slaw does not justify \"Jalapeno Cole Slaw\".  We arrived late, approx 30 minutes before closing and the Lady rolled her eyes as we walked in.  No one ever checked on us to see if we were enjoying our meal.  WAY BETTER BBQ IN GASTON COUNTY!!!",

My family split a pound of pulled pork, mac and cheese, baked beans, coleslaw, onion rings, brunswick stew, and hush puppies. The pork was so good it didn't need any sauce, although the 3 sauces provided were very good. The baked beans had a great sweet flavor to them and the mac and cheese was delicious and smokey(my kids devoured it so fast that I barely got a bite).  The onion rings and hush puppies were fried to perfection.  The onion rings were a great balance of breading and onion that stayed together throughout the whole ring.    The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.  An Excellent experience!",

We placed a call-in order for takeout around 10:50 this morning, with a pickup time of 12:20. It was after 12:45 when I got the order. Nearly 30 minutes after the 'promised' time. No apology, or even acknowledgment that the order was late.   This was Sunday lunch, probably the most busy time. Perhaps they were short staffed.   We will go back.

    "text": "Whoa!! What can I really say... this is a rare find. Usually I'm a little skeptical about great reviews on here but this place surpassed the reviews. It's a little hidden but once you find your way in, you're greeted with a warm welcome and if its your first time, they actually take the time to go over the menu with you.   I had the Pick 3 (chorizo, brisket, pulled pork) w/ the chili mac and jalapeno slaw.  The chorizo comes a little dark and looks a little dry but once you bite into it, you get a crunch with juicy spicy pork it was cooked to perfection. I'd prefer chorizo w/ a kick but this had just a bite not too spicy but overall good flavor.  The brisket was juicy and tender, moist with a crispy outer layer. Also it carried just enough fat to give it a natural smoky flavor, not overly fatty like some other places. I Love BBQ but I'm more of a brisket person than a pulled pork person but the pulled pork I was very impressed with, crispy outside not overly dry, or wet. Perfect amount of juices to were you get a crunch from the outer layer and the inside is flaky and still moist enough to not be too chewy.  The chili Mac was Wow for me! The Mac was cheesy, they chili had a kick with just a hint of sweet. Perfect balance of texture with the soft macaroni elbow, salt/sweet of the chili, and topped off with gooey cheese. Great Side if you're really in the mood for comfort. The slaw, I'm always a sucker for great slaw to balance out a hardy mean. The slaw did just that. Best slaw I've had in a while. Not too runny, nice crunch with the fresh cabbage and carrots, a little kick with pepperoni and pickled jalapenos, served cold. Again just great balance with the meats. Only regret is not ordering an extra order of the slaw.  Last but not least, the service. Extremely friendly service. Very informative and helpful when it comes to the food. Feels like you're at grandmas house. They really go out of there way to make sure you're satisfied with everything. Awesome Place!! Highly recommended!",

The slaw( 3 flavors) was good, the pulled pork, ham , turkey were all excellent, my wife loved the brisket and baked beans, she said the baked beans were better than mine, I disagreed I add more spice to mine she don't like them that spicy. The Q sauces all 4 were good. I don't typically like the vinegar based sauces but I liked theirs. Top BBQ I've experienced in Charlotte.",

    "text": "I stopped early on Saturday to try their breakfast as my 1st time visit.  The place was empty except for a couple finishing their meal.  I sat down waiting for a waitress . . . waiting . . . waiting.  The friendly couple finally explained it is counter order only, but no one there, either.  I stood at the counter and finally flagged down a worker out in the kitchen.  I ordered a basic meal, nothing fancy.  It was good but noteworthy? No.  The restaurant is superbly decorated and whimsical.  Everything about the place suggested I must have caught them yawning in a time warp.  So, I decided to return for dinner same day.  What a difference!  The restaurant was bustling and noisy and in its zone.  The staff was friendly and dressed in clean, bright red tees (the morning shift's attire was disheveled and not in uniform).  Christine, the owner greeted me and was obviously driving the place to hit on all cylinders.  I like that.  I ordered take-out wings with 3 Amigos sauce (very good and the wings kept their moisture for leftovers next day); plus, a plate of brisket (undressed with sauce on the side) and mac-n-cheese.  The brisket was tasty and smoky; I just wanted more of it.  It weighed in at 5.72 ounces (see pic), which I thought for $11.95 was skimpy.  The MnC was overcooked and mushy--not a do-over.  I liked the honey infused hushpuppies, too.  An unexpected taste.  My experience was overall positive.  I am glad I returned.  The food was overall very good, the decor spot-on, and the location perfect.  If I lived closer I'd have another Dukedom in which to find me in!",

The high ratings are spot on. A little out of the way but less than two miles from the interstate, some might say it's a hole in the wall place. It's charming and clean inside, and you're greeted by heavenly smells. We just beat the Sunday lunch crowd but when we left there was a line out the door. They were working to quickly take orders for those in line. My husband got a pulled pork plate which came with slaw, baked beans and hush puppies. I ordered the Catawba dog with a side of fries. Our food came out reasonably fast, was freshly prepared, and was so delicious. Everyone who worked there was so friendly. Will make a point of stopping by again when we're traveling by.",

My husband thought the brisket was perfectly smoked and flavorful and passed on adding sauce.  I enjoyed the opportunity to try a variety of sauces.  The hush puppies are special, a little sweet, and compliment the spicy sauces perfectly.  (next time we will order extra!)   We also had chili mac and jalepeno slaw.    Best of all, we were able to order and pay online, specify the pick up time, and boom... done. Worked perfectly for us to stop in pick up the meal and head to our next stop.  very user friendly.  The portions were generous and provided leftovers for another meal. Definately worthy of a repeat!  soon!",

    "text": "Wowsers!  Awesome pulled pork!  This was my first time here, and if a place offers pulled pork that will be the first thing I'll try - so I did.  I was not disappointed, in fact I was very pleased.  The pulled pork was just delicious!  It was moist, tender and has a nice smokey flavor to it and a flavorful bark.  There is no need for sauce, but if you want sauce they have a small but most suitable variety with their original and hot tomato based sauces, a vinegar based sauce and one that's a mix of the other three.  For sides I tried the jalapeno slaw and bourbon (baked) beans.  The slaw was slightly creamy with a nice crunch and a wee bit of jalapeno bite.  Me, personally - I would like more jalapeno, but I've been told my taste buds are burned out.  The beans were very tasty, but nothing unique.  Just good baked beans.  The meal was very reasonably priced, and the staff was very friendly and attentive to everyone.  The next time I'm in town I will certainly be back - which is my measure for an above average dining experience.  So check it out for yourself!  I don't think you will be disappointed :-)  Back in town and had to check on my favorite local Q-Joint.  I tried the chicken tonight and I thought my tastebuds had died and gone to heaven!  The chicken was excellent!  Tender, moist and a great smokey overtone.  You may opt for sauce but you won't need it with this chicken!",

The customer service is A+   The seating situation isn't ideal especially when is cold out because only about 40 people can sit inside. There is outside seating though.  The ribs are awesome (Friday and Saturday) and even better the next day. The 3 amigos sauce is the best, it's a combination of their vinegar, sweet and hit BBQ sauce.  I've been once for brick and the scramble is something worth trying.   This visit here I'm going with he yard bird because I'm cutting down on the carbs but if now the hushpuppies are good. It was recommended to dip it in the Brunswick stew which adds an extra flair to the sweet bread balls of flavor.",

It's small inside but they have a few tables out back. I had the brisket plate that came with 2 hush puppies (which are a super sweet batter) and a couple carrots and a couple pickle slices.   The brisket was $11 which I was expecting about that price but the portion was lacking. It was sliced thin  (3mm thick I'd say) but it was only about a fist full of meat. Luckily the Mac and cheese was filling. The banana pudding was pretty good as well. Bananas were fresh and the bills wafer crumbles on top were awesome.  I kept 1 star for price and 1 for portion. I'll come back and see if either measure changes.  Cheers!  As far as staff, the 3 teenage girls that were speed walking orders out and wiping tables down. TOP NOTCH. They were super friendly and one girl even kept me from busting my ass on a slippery floor haha. Service was fast too considering the huge crowd.

After my meal (which I never wanted to end) I decided to take some banana pudding to go. The plan was to eat it later that night, well that plan failed. I ate the entire container in the car - it was perfectly creamy, and topped off a great meal.   I don't write reviews very often, but when I do it's because the meal was exceptional. This was exceptional BBQ. I wish we had BBQ like this in the Northeast but, alas.... it just means I need to take another trip to NC ;)",

Peace N Hominy serves up both terrific BBQ and the friendliest service -- what's not to love?  Located in East Belmont, the restaurant has a cozy, homey feel. Upon arrival, staff warmly greet you and ask if you have any questions about the menu. Like most BBQ joints, you order food at the cash register and then find a table.   The menu here is quite comprehensive and they serve a variety of smoked meats such as brisket, pulled pork, bacon, chicken, and turkey. My favorite meats are the pulled pork and brisket -- both are super tender and full of smoky flavor. They also have a nice selection of side dishes, featuring a solid coleslaw, slightly sweet hush puppies, and creamy grits. I wasn't a huge fan of the macaroni and cheese (basically pasta + shredded cheese), but you can't go wrong with any of their other side dishes. They have a nice selection of BBQ sauces, ranging from vinegar-based (my favorite) to traditional to spicy. I haven't been crazy about the desserts I've tried here, but that's okay, because I rarely have room for dessert after eating a delicious plate of BBQ!   The service here is top-notch! The staff are genuinely kind and friendly and truly exemplify Southern hospitality! Thank you so much for adding such a great restaurant to the Belmont food scene!",

    "text": "This was just what I wanted after a hot day  outside. It fast casual and you order at the counter. Large menus are on the wall and it's easy to understand. The staff was so friendly and explained a few things. The pulled chicken plate was fantastic!  The chicken was moist and flavorful before I even tried any of the sauces. I liked all 4 sauces. They have a sweet, a peppery vinegar,  a spicy with just a little kick and then one which combines all the other three. They were all good. If you like NC vinegar based bbq you'll love that one. My favorite was the combo sauce. I've never seen it before and it was terrific. The slaw was good and helps too temper the spicy heat. The hushpuppies were fresh and had good flavor. The mac and cheese was excellent,  very creamy. The sweet tea was fabulous! So perfect for cooling down. I measure a restaurant by if they make their own tea and this earned them many points!  There is a reasonable amount of inside seating and an adorable outside area. They serve breakfast as well. If I lived in the area I would be eating here all the time. I would love to have been able to try the pork, Turkey, brisket or burgers but I couldn't finish all the food I had since I also got the banana pudding. Every north carolinian knows that is the best dessert to have with bbq! It was a nice end to the meal and a huge serving. I've already suggested this place to a friend who is in Charlotte often. The town is cute. Lots of gorgeous homes and shops.",

From the whimsical butcher paper menu & paper straws to the homey decor & insanely sweet staff, it just feels comfortable and delightful.  I've tried quite a few things at Peace-N-Hominy and have been there for lunch and dinner (breakfast/brunch is on my must do list though!) The BBQ's great, burgers are traditional pharmacy-style treats, and hushpuppies & fries are perfection! And there's Cheerwine (in a glass bottle AND fountain--SWOON!) My only letdown was the mac & cheese. The mac & cheese is unlike any I've had before with semi-cheesy, warm noodles in a cup with cold, shredded cheese tossed on top. It looked intriguing but was bland and, once the cold cheese was mixed in, rather cold & unusual! Just wasn't for me!  My only reason for a 4 star rating as opposed to 5 is simply consistency. I've had meals before that were positively perfect & wonderful and then I've had some where my burger was charred & the food just wasn't great! I think part of it was likely just timing. When I've been and it's less crowded, the food has been best! When it's been insanely busy (like Sundays after church), the food has come up a little lacking. With such a small restaurant, it could simply be a matter of being overwhelmed when it's crazy busy. The good experiences definitely outweigh the bad though and I'll definitely be back but hope to see more consistency in the quality going forward!",

    "text": "After a long morning of travel we were delighted to find Peace-N-Hominy fairly near the Airport. We walked into an incredibly welcoming place- we immediately felt the hospitality that defines the service we encountered throughout our visit. Each staff member we interacted with showed warmth, attentiveness to our needs, and joy.   The food was also very good!   We had a three meat sampler with onion rings, wings, two types of coleslaw, and extra hush puppies. The boys split a corn dog with fries.   The wings were incredible- a nice fruit-wood smoke, and very juicy (I'm guessing they're brined before smoking?). The skin was wonderful and they dust them with some salt with a touch of sugar in it. We got them with the sauce on the side and I would recommend doing the same. Their ranch and blue cheese are homemade and amazing. (I don't usually comment on the blue cheese, but it was surprisingly good).   The three meat plate we ordered included their bacon (order this) their pulled pork (very good) and their Brisket (our only disappointment).  The bacon strips were decadent and worth trying. Again- fruit wood Smokey, sweet, salty and fatty. Amazing. Pulled Pork was quiet good and made a great vehicle to try their four sauces: original (sweet, but not cloying), spicy (but not blazing hot) Carolina vinegar , and then one that is all three mixed up. Our favorite was the original. The brisket was disappointing, but I think we are ruined on brisket because no one comes close to Texas style, which is what we are always hoping for.   The Jalapeno Coleslaw was awesome.   The hushpuppies were also very good especially because they were covered in their sweet and salty dust.   Ok this is too long. Eat here, it's good.",

    "text": "We grabbed lunch at Peace-N-Hominy Q early on a Sunday afternoon.  I ordered a brisket plate with chili mac as my side, jalapeno slaw, and a link of chorizo.  The brisket was tender but dry.  This has been a recurring theme with their smoked meats every time I've eaten here.  It tastes good but is screaming for some salt, and their \"hot\" barbecue sauce isn't hot at all and has a more assertive sweet quality to it.  The jalapeno slaw was good, but it's literally their regular slaw with a single pickled jalapeno slice placed on top.  If there is diced jalapeno in the slaw itself, it's completely invisible.  The chili mac is tasty, but extremely rich and needs a little salt.  I usually finish everything on my plate but I couldn't get through all of it.  It was the second time I ordered their chorizo and it's absolutely delicious.  They season and spice it perfectly.  Unfortunately on this occasion, it was griddled a bit too long which desiccated the exterior and made the texture somewhat crunchy and unappealing.  It was also less juicy than on my previous visit.  Overall it was a tasty meal, but I feel like there are just a few details keeping this place from being the best it can be.",

    "text": "We were driving through the area looking at houses and we stumbled across this little restaurant. My fiance wanted something \"local\" so we stopped and never expected the pleasant surprise we received. From the outside entrance and parking in the back you cannot even tell there is a restaurant. From the moment we walked in the service was amazing. Jaime greeted us with a cheerful and pleasant smile which began by asking if we had eaten there before. When we told her no, she explained that the menu was on the wall and we should order the food first. We shared a mixed plate which had wings, pulled pork and brisket. Wow! the wings we ordered plain and I am so glad we did. They were juicy and tasty with the reg rub that is used. The other meats were equally yummy. They had 3 or 4 sauces, but I chose the one that was a blend of all three. also, amazing. I had a nice beer from their wide selection and some jalapeno cole slaw. Initially I thought I would not like it until Jaime said it was her favorite so I tried it. Boy am I glad I did. Everything was so good I opted to have dessert. They had a banana pudding that was wonderful and a specialty pie that was called a butter pecan pie. When asked what it tasted like I was asked... Have you ever eaten butter pecan ice cream? I said yes and sure enough that is exactly what it tasted like. At one point we had the opportunity to meet Kristine the owner. What a grand slam to bring an end to an amazing meal with some of the friendliest people you will ever meet. Prices are great. Food is great. If traveling through Charlotte or going to the river... you wont want to miss this little.. out of the way... local restaurant that is truly one of a kind. Thank you to Kristine and Jaime!! Ana and I will certainly return for more of your southern hospitality. :))",

There is literally nothing on their menu that I haven't enjoyed.  The burger was awesome too, and those onion rings are fabulous.    They've also got great Brisket, Pulled Pork, Ribs (totally awesome, but you'll need to go on a Friday or Saturday), Turkey, and yes, even a Bacon item on the menu.  I also really enjoy their salad, mac-n-cheese, slaw, and Brunswick stew.   Also, they offer an awesome breakfast menu.   We're really glad to have this restaurant and family business in Belmont!",

The meat was bland with hardly any seasoning and the brisket did not have the smoke ring you look for in brisket.  The mark of good BBQ is how good the meat is before you add their sauce and this meat did not meet the mark.  Positives: The staff was friendly and helpful, the hushpuppies were amazing and the sauce that I had (vinegeratte based) was good.",

I am so happy I checked out Yelp and decided on this lovely little restaurant.  I stopped in for a late lunch, and the server that was there was one of the most pleasant staff I've ever encountered. I explained that it was my first time visiting, and she explained the menu to me in detail. She made some recommendations, and I ended up going for the 2-meat combo plate of brisket and pulled pork. My sides were the mac n' cheese, slaw, and hush puppies.  I've had hush puppies before and wasn't impressed, but these were REALLY good! I loved the sweet flavor they had, and they were perfectly soft and moist on the inside, and exquisitely crispy on the outside. Mmmmmmmm. The hush puppies were actually my favorite of the three sides.  The pulled pork was excellent, and I love that there are various different sauces available to try. I sampled all, but the original house sauce (I think that's what it's referred to) was my favorite. It had the perfect combo of tangy and sweet.  I'm not in NC often, but when I go visit my client in the area next time, I'll make sure I make time to stop by for some more BBQ!",

We had Pul'd pork, brisket, bacon, wings, grits, bourbon beans, slaw, cream corn and banana pudding and apple crisp.  (Big Family)  All the meat was well smoked and tasted fantastic.  The pork was pulled in chunks and had very little fat attached.  Great brisket and it was incredible with their 3 amigos sauce.  The wings - amazing!  Only thing we didn't care for were the grits.  Not bad but not a lot of flavor.  We are also from the North originally, so we are a bit picky about grits.    The staff made sure we were happy and being taken care of.  Prices were very fair.  Place was had great atmosphere and was clean.  Great selection of glass bottle sodas and beer.  Definitely worth a visit!",

The owner is very involved - she explained the menu, took our order (on an IPad) and even brought the food to our table. The service here is excellent. Look around the small dining room and you'll see lots of smiles from the staff and the customers.  Breakfast is served on weekends until 3PM for late risers.  My wingman had pancakes, eggs and sausage which he proclaimed \"Delicious\". I had a two meat combo plate with pulled pork and brisket. Both were fork tender, and the brisket rub was very good. The Bourbon baked beans were pretty dang amazing (with chucks of bacon). The jalapeno slaw was made with jarred/pickled jalapenos and didn't really stand out (maybe use fresh seeded ones for more kick?). Of their three homemade sauces the Hot was hands down my favorite.Well done! I love going to restaurants where they stand by their food and want to make sure you enjoy yourself. I also like that they carry craft beer from Railroad Brewery which is owned and operated by military veterans.  Parking available on the side and back lot. Two entrances - one in the back and one by the Belmont Drugs entrance.  A current Yelp offer took 10% off our bill, which isn't chump change!",

It looked like a scene out of a movie at night.   We walk in and are greeted by me of the owners. She tells us how it works (probably her 10,000th time) but she tells us as if it is the first. Patient and helpful. What a menu. BBQ of course and other simple fare like chili dogs and burgers. Fries and onion rings.   I ordered the 3 meat and got pulled pork, bacon slices and beef brisket.  The brisket is smoked for 15 hours.  Now that is dedication!  The bacon is the kind of bacon you might kill another man for!    My son had a chili dog.  When it came out - he about fell out of his chair.  He was not ready for it to be. Foot long!  He really liked it. We shared fries and onion rings.  The rings were terrific.  The fries are a weak spot for them.  If the owners are reading this, do away with these fries and go fresh cut.  It would perfectly complement your other items.   I also had the jalapeno slaw.  An interesting take.  I would have preferred shredded slaw to the finely chopped but it was still very good.    The owner checked on us 3-4 times during the meal and also sent us on our way.  What attentiveness!  I highly recommend this place can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "With such a high user rating on Yelp... I made this restaurant a priority on my list while returning to the area on business. My meal was good but nothing special. I absolutely love BBQ and would have to say that while nothing was bad.....very little stood out as great or outstanding. I ordered the 3 meat plate (pulled chicken, pulled pork, and smoked turkey) with slaw, beans, and potato salad. The chicken was very dry, pulled pork was average, but I must say the smoked turkey was very good. In my opinion the hallmark of any quality BBQ will be the sauce.....and again I found them to be....average. I tried all four and was unimpressed. Like the sauce, the beans and slaw where simply average. The potato salad was good and as other reviews pointed out the hush puppies are uniquely sweet and standout as different. Enjoyed my meal well enough, but would not likely return or recommend it as a \"must do\".",

We found this place after enjoying a stroll in the Daniel Stowe Botanical Gardens nearby.  The parking was super easy and the menu was very easy to navigate once inside.  We tried the pulled pork plate and the BBQ sandwich.  The slaw was exactly how I remember it growing up in the south.  The pork was juicy and flavorful with 4 options of sauces to use at each table.  My fav was the vinegar based sauce.  The staff were very welcoming and friendly.  Within 2 mins of us sitting down, we had our food.  Super fast!   We also had two waitresses check on us to make sure we were happy with our food and that we had everything we needed.  Each time, we were greeted with big smiling faces and bubbly personalities.  We will certainly be back again, with a group next time.  This place is too awesome to not share with friends and family.  Plenty of seating and a cooler of drinks if you don't want fountain sodas.  You have to check them out!!   Enjoy!",

There is minimal staff to customer interaction. I wish there was at least someone to seat people since there were people of two sitting at large tables, when you could see a family of 4-6 struggling to sit somewhere. The food was SO good though. The Mac n cheese had a Smoky flavor throughout. I have never had anything like it. The slaw was tasty. There were different homemade barbecue sauces that were delicious. Maybe next time we will order to go because of the seating situation.",

    "text": "Alright, listen up. Sometimes in life we have meaningful experiences that help shape us into who we are. These may include graduating high school, a first kiss, first time buying a house, etc. Your first visit to Peace-n-Hominy can be added to the list. When you first walk in you notice an aura of southern hospitality that is promptly followed by a warm greeting. Alexis, the young woman working at the counter, asked me if it was my first time dining there and passionately broke down the menu for me. She described her favorite dishes in a way that showed that she truly loves the food and is not just regurgitating the information she was told to say. After a friendly conversation with her, I sat down and patiently waited for my three meat plate. It included pulled pork, brisket, and chicken wings. I had never had wings at a barbecue restaurant before, but I am so glad I did. The three meats I enjoyed were cooked to perfection. Wings were perfectly crisp, brisket was tender, and pulled pork was melt-in-your-mouth-y. I tried all four of their homemade sauces and personally loved the original and the 3 amigos (mix of original, vinegar, and sriracha sauces). Another worker named Chris checked in occasionally to make sure I was enjoying my meal. I noticed that he genuinely cared about my response and wasn't just doing it as a formality. I cannot wait to go back for more delicious barbecue. It's hands down the best I've ever had, and their staff is just as great.",

We split the peanut butter pie which was fair. I think it came from the local grocery store - not homemade for sure. Service was excellent.

Jalapenos slaw is Grateful Dead coveting Buddy Holly good.   I had the wings, brisket and pork. Wood smoked wings was a new incarnation of the wing family for me, and they were the star of the meal. Meaty, juicy, tender. Hit them w/ the sriracha BBQ sauce and let the tongue Moon walk. The brisket & pork aren't the greatest in the world, but they're in the top 10%.   For desert I koala'd down the hush puppies. I'm pretty sure that's a traditional southern desert.  They have beer too.",

Plate came with a lot of pork, 2 hush puppies (delicious, would get side next time), slaw (3 kinds), side and a couple pickles. Husband got brisket plate with cheese grits and bbq slaw. Enjoyed both, grits had corn in it which was unexpected but not bad. Fried pickles were interesting. Good, salty. We will be back, plenty of choices on menu and want to try their breakfast on weekend. Give them a try. Counter order.",

    "text": "I have had numerous issues with this place.  So bad that about 2 years ago I sent a personal email to the owner describing how awful my experience was and he offered to send me a $25 gift card and comp my meal on the grounds I would not give the restaurant a negative review online.  I turned down the $25 gift card but did allow him to comp my meal.  I was so mad at the incident I told myself I would never eat at this restaurant again.  Well, due to some slim pickings I made the decision to eat here again.  So I've eaten here about 4 times since I sent that email.  So this is spread across the last couple of years.  So let's just go through those times  1st time) I ordered online.  Chose the ASAP option.  Get there and the staff knew nothing about my order.  I had to wait in the restaurant 25 minutes for my order because they were \"backed up\".  I did not really think anything of it.  I wrote it off as an exception, probably won't happen again.  2nd time) I order online again.  Chose the ASAP option.  Get there and again they have no clue about my order.  I even waited 20 minutes before leaving my house.  I tell the staff, the lady at the front said \"look we are busy, you might have ordered online but you also need to call and check to see where your order is in line\".  I was taken aback, I thought, \"man that was a pretty rude exchange.\"  I waited an additional 20 minutes for my food at the restaurant.  Anyway, I said ok, you know I will just call next time.  Not a big deal I guess. I definitely left feeling uneasy  3rd time) I order online.  Chose ASAP option.  Then called.  Was told on the phone my order would take about 25 minutes.  I then go there 25 minutes later.  I walk in, they say \"online order?\"  I say \"for (insert name)?\" they say \"yes\"  I say \"for (insert name)?\" Just to double check, again \"yes\" . I drive all the way home, I open the order, it is 100% someone else's order.  I call, I say \"you guys gave me the wrong order\".  They say \"we are sorry, can you come back?\".  So I drive all the way back to the restaurant only to find my order is there sitting.  I said \"look, I have been away for 25 minutes, I do not want that cold food.  Can you remake it?  I mean, this was your mistake?\"  O they remade it, but they were not happy.  And I had to WAIT, an additional 20 minutes.  Do the math on that guys.  It took me an hour and a half to get a simple burger and fries.  4th and Last time) My wife is hesitant that I even order.  She said, \"we have never had a good experience\".  \"Well\" I said, \"let's give it another try, ok?\".  So I order a Pig Burger or whatever it's called and an All American burger with a side of BBQ slaw. I order online, choose ASAP option . Call ahead, confirm my online order.  It's going to take about 25 minutes.  I say \"ok\".  I show up 35 minutes later!  Just to be safe.  I get there and the manager comes out.  She is wide eyed.  She says, \"Are you (insert name)?\" I say \"Um, yes?\"  She goes \"look, we gave someone else your order.  We think they may come back and we can give it to you\" . I say \"WHAT!? No, don't give me that order.  Remake it at least.\"  She said \"ok\" She was about to give me a cross contaminated order.  And did not even think about that.  So they remade it.  The manager felt bad and even said she was \"sorry\".  I said \"no hard feelings\".  I wait 20 minutes.  I get the remade order.  I take it to the car, my wife checks it.  THERE IS NO LETTUCE, TOMATO, PICKLE, on the All American Burger and NO BBQ SLAW.  So not only did you make me wait an additional 20+ minutes for your mistake, you did not even give me the right order.  So I go back in.  The staff starts bickering back and forth.  They literally just send the food back there and some guy adds lettuce, pickle, tomato.  It was gross.  I make sure to ask, \"did you include BBQ slaw?\"  They said \"yes\". Again, I take it to the car.  My wife checks.  She goes \"THERE IS NO BBQ SLAW!?!?\"  I was livid.  I go in (mind you I have now been there 45 minutes for an order I placed online an hour ago) and said \"There is no bbq slaw, I even asked\" . The manager was livid at the staff.  I said \"I am going to have to review you online and I will never eat here again.\"  And left.  I eventually got home an hour and 15 minutes from when I left.  My wife got sick from the burger.   This was the last straw.  So here is my review.  The food is ok.  You cannot order the pork plates because they are too small.  Burger is the only bet.  But they will get your order wrong and make you feel like it is your fault it is wrong.  Also, it is not enough food.  They short you.  I am not an obese male either.  I am a regular person who for a $11 meal thinks I should get more than 4 onion rings when they cost an additional $1.00 as a side item.  I will never eat here again. I have never ONCE had a normal experience here.  There was always a problem",

Staff was very very friendly and helpful, you can tell they really care about the business, the food and the customers their satisfaction! What I really loved...   The sauces, which actually added flavor to the meats and enhanced the taste   The Cole Slaws, both regular and jalapeno were very good   Onion Rings were hand breaded and light and flaky, loved them! What was just okay...   Got the 3 meat combo (pork, chicken and brisket) all 3 were dryer than they were juicy and not as flavorful as I would have expected.  But, the sauces really combined well and made the meat \"pop\", so it wasn't at all bad.    The chicken wings were big, juicy and cooked perfectly, but again, the taste of the special rub was a bit elusive, but 3 Amigo Sauce helped add great flavor.    If I was in Belmont again, I would eat here, as everyone raved about the ribs, which we didn't get because they were 30 minutes away from getting done.      Would like to have given 3.5 stars, but rounded up to 4 due to the staff!",

Brunch/Breakfast: Great selection, and the portions are very generous to fill you up for breakfast and lunch combined!  It gets pretty busy in there, but there still seemed to be enough tables for the line even at the longest point.  Dinner: I found it is usually a bit slower in the evenings from a few trips, which makes it very quick to order and get your food.  I had the special item, which should be added to the regular menu!  It was a Havana type cuban sandwich... I can still remember the taste of it.  If you haven't tried this yet, definitely make a quick trip there.  Likely won't be disappointed!",

They offer daily specials, as well as the regular Carolina style of grub- pulled pork.  They have a variety of meats- including beef cuts and meatloaf. Their sides are where it's at. I had bourbon baked beans, which had a delicious sweet taste to them. Their hushpuppies also had a sweetness to them.  They have 4 different BBQ sauces- Hot, Original, Vinegar, and the 3 Amigos- which is a blend of the other three. My favorite was the hot version, as I am accustomed to Texas BBQ, but the three amigos had the perfect ratio of vinegar to the tomato sauces, if you ask me!  They even offer Southern sodas and sweet tea, of course. Cheerwine Cola and Sun Drop Soda are available on tap.  The whole restaurant is doing their best to be eco-friendly, recycling their waste, and issuing wooden forks & knives, and paper straws to go with your eco-friendly cup.  The decor includes kids' drawings of animals that get BBQ'd, and are especially well done.  Overall, this is a great dining experience, and I'd recommend it highly to get some local cuisine.",

This is high quality food with fresh ingredients and a creative flair that makes their menu items interesting and flavorful. I love the fact that recycled paper products are used. This restaurant is extremely clean and the owners are kind, happy people who are there daily and take pride in excellent customer service. I love the smoked wings, chili mac, ribs, brisket. It's all good!",

    "text": "So I sold a car and was flush with cash-always a good thing, right?  Anyway, since we moved from New York, we've done all of our banking online including check deposits. We don't really deal in much cash.  The nearest branch of my New York bank was in Fort Mill, South Carolina. After gassing up for $1.839/gallon, I reached the bank and made the deposit.  It was near lunchtime so I popped open the Yelp app on my iPhone as I'd done many times before. Punched in BBQ because, well, BBQ. I was looking for my old standby, Old Hickory House Restaurant in Charlotte. Well up pops an ad for Peace-N-Hominy Q Shack.   I've had mixed results with Yelp ads but I decide to take a shot-it seems new and there are only 9 reviews-all but 1 was positive. I saw that the brisket was good (I love all smoked meats and brisket is a favorite).   I ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of hushpuppies and a bottle of Cheerwine.  I asked for hot sauce, it came out with a big bottle.   Took a bite of the sandwich and was amazed at the fat cap on the brisket-it melted with each bite. There was a good smoke ring and the hot sauce wasn't that hot for my taste-but it was delicious. Nota Bene: I've been known to drink Buffalo Wing sauce to check if it's spicy enough....  Anyway back to the sandwich-served on a soft, fresh burger bun, it was outstanding, They did offer to put lettuce, tomato or whatever on it, but I wanted to try it standalone. The hushpuppies are my favorite ball shaped ones (hey now) rivaled only by BBQ Joe's in High Point, NC.   Service was great and the place has rolls of paper towels on the table (points) and is well decorated and immaculately clean. Now I'm okay with a hole-in-the-wall BBQ place but this was very warm and welcoming.  It is clear they put a lot of thought into this place and take their BBQ seriously.   I gave it 5 stars as it earned it-and my 9 year old son agreed--I brought some back for him for dinner. He plowed through it and usually hates fat on any meat-but loved this.  I will go back, with family in tow, and hope it lives up to the 5 stars. I will definitely try some other items on the menu.  If I have 1, minor gripe, it was definitely on the high end of pricing. A sandwich was $9.99 and a platter $11.99. I'm used to Triad pricing. In fairness, they are new and this is a quality product. They do not skimp on portions-but just a bit of sticker shock. Also this would be a $15-20 sandwich in New York.  Side note-another 2 people were in and said they saw the ad on Yelp and came in to try.",

    "text": "Not awful...but not remarkable in any way.  Ordered BBQ pork plate with original slaw and cheese grits. Server forgot the slaw, initially, but provided upon request.    Cheese grits were lumpy and bland.  Apparently, they went the route of Kraft shredded cheese (mild cheddar and mozzarella) which combined to make something akin to wet plaster in texture and taste.  Truly awful.  Crust on hush puppies was very tough; which made me think they were re-fried or left in fryer too long.   BBQ was smoked okay; though the outside cuts didn't indicate any seasoning.  Sauces are served on the side, which I prefer, with the choices being Hot, Original, and Vinegar. Watch out when using them; as the dispensers tend to spray uncontrollably.  I've had BBQ all over NC and usually find it delicious.  I'd suggest looking for something other than this place.  Someone with active tastebuds needs to help their cooks develop a signature taste.

Depending on your geography and upbringing, you may bring preconceived ideas about what good 'Q ought to be. In Charlotte alone there are probably a hundred styles. This accounts for the roller coaster reviews for any barbecue joint. There's a lot of emotion in that thar smoke. Peace n hominy, though, has got a good thing going. We had the smoked wings and the ribs which are only available on Friday and Saturday. The meat was really good. Well seasoned with a good pink smoke ring. The ribs were soft enough to just about fall off the bone but not soft enough to totally come apart. They have several sauces. Original, three amigos, vinegar based and a sriracha based. Tried em all. No losers in the crowd. The slaw comes in regular, barbecue and jalapeno. No losers here either. Smoked six cheese mac'n'cheese?  You just may get tired of winning...  Finished up. Toweled off with the wet naps. Grabbed a tea refill to go. Will be back to try the hush puppies.   Staff, by the way, is warm and welcoming like a small family place should be. Prices were great. They also did a nice job decorating the place. Thanks for lunch!",

They have four sauces that are homemade, three different kinds of homemade slaw, and lots of home cooked sides! The service is second to none! When I arrived the girl at the register asked if I had been here before, when I told her no, she came out from behind the counter and walked me through the entire menu, specials, and everything I needed to know about everything they made (I noticed they did this with every new person who came in). Also, during our lunch five different people came to check on us to see how we were doing and if we needed anything. On top of all that, the atmosphere was amazing. Felt like a down home mom and pop BBQ joint and the prices were reasonable. There is no doubt I will be back again, and again, and again....",

Prices are fair, food is FRESH, serving sizes are great, food is delicious, and they are a scratch made, eco friendly place (biodegradable takeout boxes, straws, cutlery, etc)! Also, service was EXCELLENT. can't remember the guys name but he walked us through the whole menu (you order and pay at the counter and they bring you the food). He gave suggestions and answered every question with a smile. He made the experience even better. We will most definitely be returning!",

My husband got the wings and they are a hit as well get them plain so you can try all the sauces. We cheated and got banana pudding and it was great.

They give you a numbered stand to place on your table and they bring the food out when it is ready.  They give you your drink cups when you place your order and you get them from a stand nearby.  The food was fresh and tasty and just the right amount for a meal.  I do plan to go back and we live half an hour away so that says something.  It is pleasantly decorated and clean.  Friendly people too.  My wife could not decide what coleslaw to she wanted and they gave her a sample so she could decide. (The jalapeno is not too spicy but tasty.)

The menu is posted on the wall and you order/pay at the register then take a seat. It took a bit to decide because it all sounded tasty but I ended up on the \"Porkapalooza hash, \" a mix of pulled pork, bacon and sausage with homefries and onions and then topped with chorizo gravy and then two eggs (I chose mine poached). A mess of food but holy cow (pig?), tasty as all get out. The eggs were cooked perfectly.  Yep, this barbecue joint does a weekend brunch menu. Woot!

The pork was tender and good seasoning ( my favorite is still Midwood bbq though this was tasty.) I chose my side as the stew and it is savory and had tasty vegetables. The hush puppies were good, three came with the meal. They had many meats as plate choices and the breakfast menu looked delicious. I think the bbq is good and the service was great! We parked in the lot behind the restaurant. My dad had the bacon plate with baked beans and loved the meat & side. My sister had the mac and cheese side and hush puppies and loved her food too.",

It's go up to the counter style ordering and then they bring your food out to you wherever your sitting. Nothing beats sitting out on the porch!!   Breakfast, lunch or dinner there is nothing you can order that can go wrong. I've been a few times now and always grab something different. Mostly because I'll sit down with my food (that looks delicious) and then see someone else's food that looks amazing too.   Their breakfast specials are so good. The chorizo gravy is amazing just over rice but they make some concoctions on a plate that you wouldn't expect. And they are all great!   Still don't miss out on their bbq and other southern staples they have. They will keep you coming back for sure!",

Peace-N-Hominy had been recommended to me by my dearest old man (see if you can spot his review!) and I was really looking forward to giving it a shot. Honestly, if you're looking for a healthy option, this might not be the best choice, but if you're not in the mood to count calories, order it all! They've got a small by southernly inviting shop with wooden accents and scripture verses all over the walls (definitely home-town-southern feel). I honestly don't LOVE the layout. It's a little cramped and you have to wait in line to order while looking at the menu on the wall that looks to have been designed more for graphic appeal then actual customers (the fonts are hard to read from a distance and it's just a lot of color and texture). We also had a long time getting everything keyed into the Ipad to order, good in theory, but slow if the waiter is learning or maybe not technology savvy.   We ordered the W.I.T. Hotcakes with bacon and the B.E.L.T. plus two coffees. I'd highly recommend SKIPPING the coffee. I can drink just about anything and this was just undrinkable. Plus, if you want \"iced coffee\" they provide you with a cup of ice to pour the hot coffee over. I know we're in a small town, so you're not going to get the big city amenities, but honestly, it'd be better in my opinion if they didn't even offer it. Both the meals were good, home cooked southern food. I loved the pimento cheese on the BLT take and the peach sauce on the pancakes was sweet and tangy. I'd skip the biscuits next time. Honestly, nothing was bad, it just wasn't something I'd return for. I WILL visit again for the BBQ, I think that's where they might shine more (I mean that bacon they served was awesome!) and really am looking forward to another visit next time I'm visiting dear old papa bear.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place based on the reviews but was left disappointed. While the staff is friendly and welcoming the BBQ was just mediocre. Brisket lacked a smoke ring and was reheated. Pulled pork was tender but lacked the depth of flavor that you would expect from real North Carolina BBQ. Hush puppies were dense and doughy and for some reason we're rolled in sugar. The search continues for good BBQ in the area.  In reply to Peach & Hominy's response: I ordered the brisket and pork plate. So by \"plenty of smoke and time\" are you talking 15 hours on a wood-fired smoker or is the brisket cooked in an oven and finished off (or started) on a commercial gas smoker? It tasted like the latter. I guess I was just expecting a deep smoke ring and depth of flavor that you can only get from going low and slow on a wood smoker. This is one of the BBQ capitals of the world after all.  It wasn't bad and if I was looking for a quick lunch it could be an option but I was seeking out real North Carolina BBQ.  P.s. Where was the hominy on the menu? :)",

The hush puppies were my appetizer on the drive home and they ACTUALLY taste like cornbread rather than just deep fried sugar bread! I was very impressed but it only got better when I popped open the box with the burger. First of all, even after driving home first, the burger looked like a picture. It was gorgeous. The bacon was thick and cooked well but not over cooked and breaking off, the cheese was divine and the bbq? Mmh. My god. It was incredible, y'all. I can't even. The fries were fine and the Mac was waaaay better than it looks. I'll definitely be making this a new go to spot when I'm in Belmont.",

I was across the street at the antique store browsing around when I got the feeling I'd had enough antiques and needed something to eat. Popped on yelp, found this place and thought to myself I might have seen it on my feed before. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries. I was going to order coleslaw too but the girl ringing me up let me know it comes with just enough to put on your sandwich already. My kind of place! Everything was fresh, hot and flavorful. The sauces are on the table and they've got 3 or 4 to choose from. No mustard based Carolina sauce here, though. They've got lots of bottled beer and soda options. My meal plus a hard cider came in around $10. Is this real life? What a deal! The menu was a little hard to navigate the first time around; lots to read but who am I kidding I was going to get pulled pork anyways. The restaurant is small and clean with pleasant people working there serving good food. What more could I want?",

    "text": "\"But death certainly, and life, honor and dishonor, pain and pleasure, all these things equally happen to good men and bad, being things which make us neither better nor worse. Therefore they are neither good nor evil.\" --Marcus Aurelius, Meditations   TL/DR: Delicious food, nice employees, over-priced food, and small serving sizes.  Traffic coming home from Charlotte was unpleasant. I didn't feel like sitting parked in traffic on the interstate, on a 90F degree day. I decided to take the Belmont exit and have some barbecue.   I knew exactly where the restaurant was, because I had been to the restaurant's former occupant: Ranucci's. Ranucci's was famous for their competition barbecued ribs, which they NEVER had available, so they went out of business.  There is plenty of free parking.    ORDERING is a go to the counter affair, pay, take a number, find a seat, and wait deal. (Bring your reading glasses or a magnifying glass if you wish to pay by credit card.)  I got the two meat platter with brisket and pulled pork, fries, coleslaw, and a fountain soda. $15.xx. (The cashier tried to gently dissuade me from ordering their coleslaw. I should have paid attention.)  This restaurant is charming, rustically decorated, and miniscule inside. I'd guesstimate that they may be able to seat 25 people max., probably more, but everyone would be elbow to elbow and miserable.   As an aside, their one person men's bathroom was clean.   My food took about fifteen minutes to arrive. When my plate was presented I was kind of surprised at how little food there was, especially for $15+. There was only a token amount of brisket, two hush puppies, and at most two tsps. of coleslaw in a tiny paper cup. But I smiled, said thank you, and dug in.   There were about five sauces on the table, along with some ketchup and hot sauce. Salt. Pepper. Brown paper towel roll.   Pulled Pork, 3.5/5 Middle of the road. Not bad. Not great. The taste was good. The sauce that I finally settled on was their sweet original sauce with a splash of hot sauce mixed in. I WOULD recommend their pulled pork. I enjoyed it. It would make a great sandwich.  Beef Brisket, 2/5 It had good beef flavor (like pot roast), but there wasn't much of it, and it was overcooked. I WOULD NOT order this again in the future.   (Brisket Pro Tip: Pull the brisket out of the smoker when it's below done temp. It should have been wrapped in aluminum foil for the last 3 hours to prevent the brisket from drying out. Let it rest. The internal temperature will continue to climb.)  Thin Shoestring French Fries. 5/5 The best thing on the table - a homerun. French style steak frites, perfectly executed. Zero grease. Properly salted. Delightfully crisp.They were better than McDonald's fries, which is my ultimate compliment.   Coleslaw. 2/5 A laughably teeny tiny serving, maybe 2 tsps. The taste was okay, but I wouldn't get this again. As it was, I almost didn't get any coleslaw THIS time.   Hush puppies, 3.5/5 There were TWO golf ball sized hush puppies and they were good.  Employees? 4/5. There's really nothing to complain about, everyone was fairly friendly. One young lady kept the dining room clean and inquired about everyone's food. She didn't bother anyone and she was nice.  Drink dispenser, 4/5.  Cheerwine was on tap, so I made a cherry Pepsi. Nice!   Price? 15.xx The food was better than I expected, with decent flavor. The prices were higher than I expected, and the portion sizes were on the small side. The rent must be high here.   To the owners: I know that this type of review is not what you want to read, but I've eaten BBQ in a lot of places, and this is how you compare. I won't apologize for being truthful, or pointing out short comings or meager servings for the price. That's all on you.   Peace-N-Hominy serves decent middle of the road pork BBQ. Give 'em a whirl.",

Now my friend ordered the Brisket, which is beef. My Honey ordered the chopped Chicken and I ordered the Pork sandwich plate. It was all wonderful and the portions were a good size. I even shared my Hushpuppies and slaw and had plenty. BBQ sauces on the table if you wish, I dipped my Puppies in each but I would not put them on my sandwich.

However- we got a couple orders of full rack of ribs this past Saturday around 530pm. To say we were disappointed is a huge understatement. The ribs tasted like they had cooked in the slow cooker, or oven at the very least. No flavor at all. No smoke. No bite....just mush meat. The only thing good was the sauce (which is always good). The burger was way overdone, the pulled pork on the burger was flavorless. Honestly the only good thing was the french fries. For a night when we had been so looking forward to barbeque...it was such a let down to spend $$$ on ribs that we could have easily made way better ourselves.",

The have a small area out the back of the kitchen which is partially covered and has some music playing and fans blowing to help with the heat.  The only downside to eating outside was having to deal with a bunch of flies who were as interested in my food as much as I was.  I pretty much had to eat my meal with one hand waving over my plate the whole time.  Not really the restaurants fault but just bear it in mind if you think about eating outside.",

His side was chili mac n cheese and then he also got coleslaw and two hush puppies. The service was good and the ladies were extremely nice but we just really weren't impressed with any of our food. The chili was basically ground beef, the brisket was not smoky tasting at all and frankly did not have much flavor and the same with the pulled pork. The mac and cheese was decent. he wings were the best part of the meal and they were just \"not bad\". We have a few other places closer to home that we prefer and most likely will not eat here again.",

    "text": "I was in Belmont, NC for business and around lunchtime I started to get hungry. I was looking for some Carolina BBQ. A Yelp friend informed me not to get my hopes up but then recommend this restaurant from a recommendation from his friend.  Good enough for me, so I thought. First, this restaurant is very obscure. Located in the rear of a retail strip center. You have to literally walk around to the rear of the building to get in. Then it's very small, maybe six or so small tables.  The lady at the counter was extremely nice. Definite showing of Southern Hospitality. She went over the menu, on the walk, and helped me pick out a lunch platter. Drinks are self serve.  A young man comes out with my meal and shows me all of their sauces. Very polite and another showing of Southern Hospitality for sure.  So you can see some positives here but let's go to the actual food.  I chose the brisket and bacon. Came with 2 sides, cole slaw and BBQ Bourbon Baked Beans.  Brisket was very good, but bacon was a disappointment to me. I expected very thick bacon, but it was regular bacon.  Cole slaw was average at best with very little flavor. But the Bourbon Beans were awesome. If my entire meal was just those beans I would give 5 Stars.  Sorry 3 Stars is the best I can offer.",

Also their patio is dog friendly if you want to bring your four-legged pal!  The establishment isn't anything fancy, which is a great sign for good food! The staff was also very welcoming, even taking the time to proudly go over their menu. If you are a glass bottle coke aficionado, they have an impressive collection. Like sweet tea? They have that too!  Prices were about normal for BBQ places. I ordered the three meat combo plate that came with the brisket, pulled pork, and pulled chicken. The brisket had nice flavored but tasted a bit boiled after the fact (not my personal preference). The pulled pork was a tad dry but overall good once you use the house made sauces on it. The chicken was well cooked and went well with the sauces as well.  The plate came with a couple of hush puppies which were absolutely delicious! Also I got the bbq coleslaw and cheesy grits which were very tasty too.   Looking to satisfy your sweet tooth? Get the banana pudding. Don't hesitate. Just do it. It is 100% worth it. Easily the best part of the meal. If it was societally acceptable to just eat banana pudding, I would do just that with PNH's pudding.  Overall good spot with great banana pudding!",

Upon entering, you place your order and get a number, find a table, fill up your drink choice and they will deliver your food to your table.  Sort of small and dark inside, but we ate out on the patio.    I liked the choice of five different sauces on the table for you to pick.  The staff was friendly and funny.  The waitress fussed over my dog and then offered to get her some cold water while we ate on the outside patio.  Seriously, how can you not like a place that welcomes your dog?   There were four of us and everyone was happy with their order.  Another plus is that I got a Yelp deal for 10% off my check.  Win!",

    "text": "Easy 5 stars.  Deserves more.  I looked this place up on yelp before my trip and had it bookmarked to try.  They also have a 10% off with yelp check in deal.  When I got there, I was so overwhelmed by the menu and the friendly service and breakdown of the menu that I forgot to use my check in deal.  Oh well.  Anyway, I'm usually not one for sides, so I normally get a pound of meat whenever I get bbq.  I decided on a pound of pulled pork.  I was feeling extra hungry from not eating all day and also decided to get a half rack of ribs combo since it was the special of the day and I had not had a chance to have ribs anywhere up to that point.  It also came with a side and coleslaw, so I figured it would break the meat up a little and I had not had any sides yet at any of the other places I had eaten.  I chose the chili mac as my side and I'm happy that I did.  It is exactly what it sounds like Chili and Mac and cheese together.  It is a beanless chili, which works for me!  When the food was dropped off, the guy who worked there who also took one of our orders (and knew this was our first time) broke down all the sauces they had to offer, what was in them, what he liked, etc.  This guy went above and beyond the whole visit to make sure we were okay, brought to go boxes, etc.  The customer service at this restaurant is TOP NOTCH.  Anyway, when my \"pound\" of pulled pork arrived, let's just say that it was probably more like 2 pounds.  I've been getting pounds of pork or brisket everywhere I visited prior to this, so either they were skimping on their pounds (which I doubt) or this place really hooked it up (which I suspect).  The ribs were fall off the bone tender and were not fatty.  All of the sauces complimented the pulled pork perfectly.  I think my favorites were the vinegar based sauce and the Sriracha sauce (it wasn't too spicy).    My friend wasn't completely full and wanted to get some ribs after the meal, but they had run out of ribs.  The woman who was working the dining room (but who also turned out to be the owner) stopped by and said she would bring out a little pulled pork on the house!  Wow, free bbq?! She returned with an EXTRA generous portion of pulled pork and a to go container for the extra.  Completely above and beyond.  Neither one of us could believe it.  He ended up giving her a hug when she stopped by later to check on us.  If I'm ever back in the area, I will come here again for sure.  I will also recommend that anyone coming to the area should go here.  I told all the people at the airbnb I was staying at.  Thank you for a wonderful meal and a memorable experience!",

It's a fast casual restaurant so you order at the counter, take a number, find a seat, and they bring your food to you. Even though it was crowded, it didn't take long for us to get our food. The dining room isn't very big, but there is additional seating outside.   I got the porkapalooza which came with cornbread. I really liked it. There were a lot of good flavors all mixed together. I also had my husband's hush puppies which were delicious. I tried some of my friend's mac and cheese which was the only thing that was disappointing. It had no flavor.   If you're in the area, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try! Don't forget to check in on Yelp for 10% off! I would come back again.",

I ordered the 3 meat plate which, for me included generous portions of pulled pork, brisket & pulled chicken with two sides. Each was moist, flavorful and the Three Amigo sauce was......drinkable! Made in house along with traditional Carolina vinegar based and their original.   Hush puppies.....just weren't enough...but delicious just the same. Did I mention the peach tea?  A word of caution....don't judge a book by it's cover! This isn't the big  production franchise eatery that's popping up everywhere!

The service was wonderful, they must have been able to tell right away from the look on our faces that we had never been before so they talked us through the entire menu and also shared some recommendations. My husband had the brisket sandwich is chili Mac and cheese and both were delicious. The bun on the sandwich had been put on the grill and had a great little crunch. They have three sauce choices and we went with the 3 amigos which is a combination of their sweet bbq, siracha bbq sauce and vinegar sauce. I got the wings, plain with a side of coleslaw. It came with ten wings which was more than enough and because I got them without sauce they had a great bit of sweet and salty flavor. The outside was crispy and there was a good amount of meat. We both said we'd return again and try out more things on the menu!",

    "text": "Thank goodness for Yelp! The fella and I needed a breakfast spot on our way out of Charlotte, so I did a little searching, and we settled on Peace N Hominy (mostly because of the ratings, but I also loved the name!).   We got there around 9 a.m. on a Sunday morning, and we thought it was closed at first since there were no other cars in the lot. That changed by the time we left! The nicest cashier/waitress in the world met us as we walked in and asked if we'd been there before. When we said we hadn't, she walked us through the deeelicious sounding menu printed from floor to ceiling on the wall. Too cute.   The fella and I decided on the 6-pack of breakfast tacos and got 2 with bacon, 2 with chorizo, and 2 with sausage (and all with cheese - of course). I got a coffee, he got a water, and it was a steal at $19. They had all kinds of syrups you could put in your self-serve coffee, too.  The atmosphere is so quaint and down home with signs that your grandma might have hanging around. This is a gem of a place!",

I've probably ate here 20 times, and it's always consistently great. The other smoked meats are great too. It's hard to find a bbq place that has good meat, and good sides. Well I found it here. Onion rings rank as some of my favorite in the charlotte area, and the hush puppies are the best I've ever had. Their sauces are homemade. 4 different sauces. There's a bbq a vinegar and a spicy. Then the three amigos. It's a blend of the other 3. On the rare occasion that I'm not stuffed, their key lime pie is spot on. This is a great place own by great people.",

I have to say were both impressed with the freshness and quality of the meat. Everything was delicious and we left with happy, full bellies.

    "text": "This review is for breakfast. I know you are saying, \"WHAT? a BBQ joint for breakfast\" but they have a pretty extensive menu for the early riser. Why the three stars, the service was horrible. The person taking orders did not know how to use the system or make change($), the menu is difficult to read and service as terribly slow for eggs and breakfast fare. The menu is posted on a wall next to the register so as you are standing in line to order you have to try to over the shoulder of the person in front of you. This makes for an awkward situation and you don't really know what to order until you are in-front of the line and then you slow down the process for everyone else. What was good you ask? The food. What we had for breakfast was all tasty except for the cheese grits. These were served to us cold. They were so cold that the cheese the cook put on the top didn't even melt. The server never asked us if anything was wrong when we left the entire dish uneaten. Food is served on paper plates BBQ joint style. There are a variety of BBQ sauces on the table and the Original Q is delicious! We will try again but maybe phone-in an order ahead.",

The indoor seating isn't awful, it just fills up very quick. The outdoor seating is beautiful, but the fly infestation is a bit of a problem! There seems to be a few tools they are using to condense the fly amount, however it's not working. It makes it extremely difficult to enjoy anything whenever you have 8-15 flies swarming around you and landing on your food constantly. I do understand that it is an outdoor area, however, I feel as if there should be steps taken to reduce that amount of fly flow. Outside of that, Peace N Hominy has an amazing staff, amazing food, and I'll be looking forward to being able to enjoy it outdoors on their amazing patio area one day!",

Love the decor; it's evident that the owners put a lot of thought and time into dressing the restaurant.  Dining room and bathrooms are always clean.  Owners/family have a really great attitude, and are always nice to deal with.  Order accuracy and turn around time is good.  And they're great people...  And then there's the food: there's nothing cheap about the cuts of meat they use; all are delicious.  The chicken is great, and the meat falls right off of the rib bone.  Deliciously smoked.  (Maybe it's because I find their food so good, that I wish their meat portions were a little bigger)  The sides are great too: brunswick stew, beans, cole slaw, puppies...all freshly prepared.  I'd say they're a destination restaurant for sure, and after dinner, downtown Belmont is a great place to have a cup of coffee, or talk a walk in the park.",

Ambiance:  Peace-N-Hominy had an extraordinarily friendly staff and atmosphere. A staff member helped us understand the menu and told us about all of the sauce options (as well as her favorite sauce combinations). After we got our food, two different employees checked up on us to see how we were enjoying our meals. There were a number of different newspapers to read while you waited. Peace-N-Hominy had very tasteful decorations.   The food:  My dad got a brisket sandwich with coleslaw and I got a pulled chicken sandwich with cheesy grits. Both of us really enjoyed what we got and loved the variety of BBQ sauces that were presented for us to test out. Grits is a dish that we do not often eat in Massachusetts so it was a special treat to have them.   Overall, I would definitely recommend Peace-N-Hominy to anyone looking for a satisfying and delicious meal in a casual and welcoming setting.",

We were led here and are very appreciative of the folks who have left reviews because we are very impressed with this small place.   They are very friendly. The first thing they did was ask if we have been there before and made sure to explain the menu. We ordered our food and they brought it to us and made sure we were explained the sauces. We love Cheerwine but don't get a lot of it from where we are from so we got the bottles. We didn't notice they had the fountain Cheerwine which we believe tastes better until later.   After we enjoyed our meal and our bottled sodas, we decided we were going to grab a couple fountain Cheerwines. When I went to pay for a couple cups, the lady just handed us two cups and told us not to worry about it and thanked us for stopping in.   The review was already a 5 before that but they made sure we would come back here next time we are in town. Thank you so much for the hospitality.",

When you read them menu it sounds amazing, unfortunately the concept never seemed to come together on any of our dishes due to little details with each part of the dish... fries seemed frozen, too much cheese(making weird texture), glossy gravy which makes it seem like it's not freshly made, dry or too sweet meats that don't compliment other parts of the dish, too much pepper, not enough seasoning, I could go on:/ was shocked, when the ratings were so high, that this was our experience!",

    "text": "My husband found this hidden spot on Yelp when we needed to run an errand in Gastonia and were looking to grab supper on the way.  It's behind the drugstore that's visible, but I've driven this route many times to work and never noticed the restaurant.  It's an unassuming space with a smallish dining area, but turn around seems pretty quick and patrons were moving in and out without wait times while we were eating.  This is an order at the counter and someone brings you your food kind of place, the menu is on the wall by the cash register and specials are listed on a roll of butcher paper that is changed daily.  It includes a Bible verse, which was kinda neat :)  We placed our order with a super helpful woman at the counter and when my husband swiped his card to pay, he was asked if he wanted to leave a tip on the card.  Now, I'm all about tipping for good service...BUT...we hadn't received any service at that point, so it felt a bit odd to be tipping BEFORE we had received our meal or even knew if we'd have a waitress.  An employee/waitress I suppose did bring our meal, but since we were handed our cups to fill ourselves at the drink station/soft drink fountain, the only time we interacted with a waitress was when one came by to take my trash.  Basically it was fast food brought to your table that you tipped someone to bring your food.  It was just strange, and now that we know, we would likely not tip the next time...I genuinely think that it's quite presumptuous to even expect to warrant one in this setting.  Now on to the food...It was actually quite good.  I ordered the turkey sandwich minus the bun (we are doing a low carb weight loss plan right now) and substituted my side of carb heavy options for a salad, minus the corn, tomatoes and croutons that I don't like or can't have on my diet plan.  The honey mustard dressing tasted like bottle Kraft, which is fine, but definitely not homemade.  The turkey was smoked I believe and had great flavor.  I cut it up and put it on my side salad for my meal and it was quite good.  My husband got the Big Porker plate which had pork bbq, bacon and ham and he really liked it.  I tried all 3 meats and aside from the bbq needing salt, I agreed.  He chose the jalapeno slaw and really liked the bit  of  a kick that it had.  The plate comes with hushpuppies, which I have a weakness for , so I did try a bite of one and mmmmmhmmmm good!  A tad sweet, perfectly cooked and oh so yummy!  He selected an apple ale from the drink case and enjoyed it as well.  We would definitely go back if we're in the Belmont/Gastonia direction and try some of the other options.  I am sure this spot is popular with the locals!",

The pork was overall just ok, a little on the dry side. If you are not a fan of sweet grits, do not order them! They add some type of sweet corn to them and only add shredded cheese on top. The hush puppies were also good. Baked beans just average as well.",

    "text": "Ok so let's talk BBQ! Peace N Hominy is a great little nook in what is sort of a passer by suburb of Charlotte. When you come here, it'll be for the meat, but you'll remember it for the sauces and boy are they good. I've lived across the South and their wing sauce is by far the hottest I've seen readily served to consumers. The pork holds its own, while the brisket is of great texture- even if a bit dry to the taste.   I reaaaaaally wanted to give this place 4 stars, but the environment keeps it as a solid 3. The blaring Christian worship music and overtly preachy decorations, conjured some very uncomfortable social issues in North Carolina. LGBT people shouldn't avoid this restaurant, however keep in mind where your money could be going. And while very, very nice, the clientele and staff present southern charm with good food, even if it can be a bit zealous.   Update: Ownership was very kind in reaching out with assurance that all are welcome at their establishment. Again, while the decor is prototypical BBQ joint, it shouldn't keep an urbanite from experiencing what is an outright down-home meal. Due to their commitment to equality and customer service, I have decided an extra star is warranted. *4",

It's a cute BBQ joint, small interior, order at a counter and sit in a hot dining room.  No AC apparently, just a few fans, and not a great product to take your mind off of the subpar attempt at BBQ! I tried a two meat combo of Pulled Pork and Smoked Turkey, with sides of Mac and Bourbon Beans.  The pork was decent even without a smoky flavor and too much fatty pieces mixed through!  The turkey was nothing more than a store bought breast, deli style sliced very thin and perfectly shaped, put through a oven to warm it up, and topped with a sauce possibly to flavor it?  BTW, the Brisket was oven roasted and fattier than the pork! The Mac n Cheese is kind of a weird dish as it's pasta with some Parmesan and shredded unmelted cheese on top.  A pretty tasteless and strange version!  The Bourbon Beans were sweet, and seemingly dumped out of a can and doctored up with brown sugar and possibly bourbon? Hence the name? On my way out, I noticed there isn't that familiar smoke in the air, nor that aroma of slow cooking meat.  Guess you don't need that for a oven I suppose?",

The young lady literally walked from behind the counter to explain the menu to us and answer any of our questions.    I had been looking at their menu throughout the day so I knew I'd be ordering their pork sandwich w/ Mac&Cheese. The pork sandwich was good, it could have been served a bit warmer but it was a good pork sandwich. The MAC & Cheese was disappointing, sprinkled with shredded cheese on top it did not represent southern Mac & Cheese at all!     The pork platter which comes with hush puppies, slaw and 1 side and a drink was a great bargain and was also good. The fries were awesome! REAL fries if you know what I mean! The hush puppies are sprinkled with brown sugar and give it a nice flavor. They have plenty of soda pop options to include Cheerwine which is a cherry flavored soft drink produced right here in NC since 1917, yum!    To end our lunch I took home a banana pudding which was so delicious and so fresh I regret not buying more!   The only reason they're not a 5 in my opinion is because of the weak Mac & Cheese, it should be cheesier and baked with breadcrumbs!",

    "text": "Utilized Yelp to find a bbq place close to our location for lunch. It's a very plain restaurant, no frills, not very big, nothing to look at on the outside either. Layout of the restaurant is deceiving .. we parked in what we thought was the back parking lot and walked around to the side, which we quickly discovered was not the front of the restaurant; the front was actually in the back of the restaurant where we parked. As I was reviewing the menu, a young girl asked if I had been there before, when I said no, she proceeded to explain the menu, the plates and the side dishes. We decided to share a full rack of ribs and onion rings for our side order. They asked us if we wanted regular coleslaw, bbq coleslaw or jalapeno coleslaw. I love spicy things so I wanted to try the jalapeno coleslaw. You order at the counter, they give you a number and you sit down and they bring the food to you. They knew we were sharing the rack of ribs, so they split it for the 2 of us; brought us utensils and a wet wipe to clean your hands afterwards. So, I will start with the jalapeno coleslaw ... what a disappointment .... it was simply coleslaw with a jalapeno slice on top. Coleslaw was mediocre. The onion rings were nice and crispy. The ribs - we both agreed that they were way too saucy; but they fell off the bone and were really good. Luckily they have a roll of paper towels on the tables as well as all the condiments, which makes it convenient. We both also ordered banana pudding, which was pretty good ... it had real slices of bananas and good mixture of pudding and vanilla wafers. I would come again because I would love to try the brisket.",

They split it for us into two plates. The best thing was the banana pudding.   Their redeeming quality is their staff!  The gentleman at the counter walked thru their menu and sales. Very friendly & professional which gave me high hopes for the place.",

The lady who runs the front is awesome. She made us feel welcome and although the place is small, she took the time to come around the register and explain the menu wall thoroughly.   I gave 4 stars and not 5 because I think they offer too many items. For example, their fried items are stellar (corn dog, onion rings, hushpuppies) but the mac-n-cheese and grits I will not get again, and my pulled pork was kinda dry. That said, I stil cannot wait to go back!",

At this point, I've got my \"usual\"- the peach W.I.T griddle toast with french fries and bacon. I'm not a big fan of potatoes, so I usually choose french fries over hashbrowns. I've also had the biscuits and gravy, which were really delicious, coming from someone who doesn't like white gravy! The coop poutine was yummy too, just a little bit of sweetness to the brown gravy to balance out all that savory egg and fries and bbq goodness. That being said, all of the portions are generous; if you leave hungry, it's your own fault! There are plenty of drink options from the case or the soda fountain, and they let you doctor your coffee however you please with fancy syrups.   The atmosphere there is great, very friendly and casual. They've got fun coloring pages for the kids, and lots of quirky decorative signs. The wait staff are attentive and pleasant, and at this point, they recognize me and my typical order. Odd though it may seem to include in a review, the bathrooms are convenient and spacious. I can only speak for the women's, but there's plenty of space to take kids in with you, maneuver a wheelchair, or assist someone with special needs. The porch is lovely as long as the weather cooperates. On the whole, a solid choice for a friendly, casual meal.",

Three of us went there today for lunch and had hoped for the best. We got some of the worst we have had.   One gentleman got a burger and it was made totally different than the sign said. It didn't have half the stuff on it it was supposed to. He said the burger tasted as those they are frozen and no where near fresh. It didn't have a good color to it at all. He said his onion rings were ok.   The other gentleman got a pulled pork plate with jalapeno slaw and onion rings. He liked the slaw. The onion rings were way over cooked and not edible.  He said the pork was not the best and would not get it again. No real flavor but was tender.   I got the pork plate with stew. I am a huge lover of Brunswick stew and this is by far the  worst stew I have had. It needs a lot of work. Almost tasted like veg-all out of a can. The pork I got was not good either. While tender it just didn't taste like anything. I had to smother it in sauce.   The water also taste really bad. I don't drink soda or sweet tea and the water out of the machine taste pretty dang nasty.   Sorry for the bad review but it is just the truth. Will not go back and will not recommend.",

Also, many of the pieces were mostly fat.  The pulled pork has also gotten worse, now comparable or worse than local bbq chains at a higher price.  Save your money and head to hillbillys or lancasters.",

We were recognized as newbies and given the rundown. I like that. My group tried the pulled pork, brisket and wings. All were excellent. Sides were good. Looking forward to going back. Want to give the breakfast a try, too.",

Fried egg on the burger was cooked perfect but realized after it was almost 3/4 gone that it was suppose to come with bacon and griddled onions. By then I figured it out it was probably too late in the game to say anything Very disappointed, especially with the price of the burger, which the price of the bacon is already added in, which I paid for but didn't receive.",

As a native of Houston, TX, I judge all barbecue establishments by their brisket. The brisket was smoked perfectly.  It was juicy and delicate with subtle hints of smoke and crunchiness. It reminded me of how my father (Butch) does it. In addition, the spicy sauce was amazing. I love a tomato based sauce and yours is superlative. It's unique, with the right blend of heat and tang.",
