I like that the house wines are good and every one is priced the same - makes it easy. I've been to many Asian restaurants that serve really bad wine. I felt very welcome by the staff. My to-go order was Sa Cha Chicken with brown rice and an egg roll. The Sa Cha Chicken had lots of vegetables, peanuts and was lightly sauced - very flavorful. I will certainly go back.",

Had the spicy thai pork and chicken lettuce wraps and they were awesome! Steamed pork dumplings and pork fried rice also delicious, and the Szechuan dumplings were the perfect amount of spice - everything was super yummy.  Great and fast service so perfect for lunch - will def be back!",

I'll start with the positives: service was good, the place was clean, all food was hot, and prices were quite reasonable for dinner. The negative: every item we ordered was devoid of any flavor. Steer clear of the Pad Thai and the basil stir fry (which had no basil).   I really wanted to like this place since it's right around the corner from me, but I doubt I'll be persuaded to return.",

The average: One thing I'd say is that the summer rolls were a bit plain. Very fresh with a touch of basil to differentiate, but without shrimp or seasonings they were all texture. The included peanut sauce didn't mesh with them, IMO. I'd also like their fried rice to be a little more exciting/better as I know day old rice is the best but this may have been a day and a half or maybe two. Very few veggies/egg.  The good: Our main courses, MuShu and a veggie stir fry, were delicious. The MuShu in particular was probably the best I've had in Charlotte though I'll admit I haven't tried a huge gamut. They included enough pancakes (thank god!) and the flavor was excellent even without the plum sauce.  The veggie stir fry was a bit plainer but honestly we also got the plainest sauce that wasn't my first choice. I think their other options would have fit the bill just right. Veggies were fresh and delicious.",

Main course we tried the chicken, veggie saute with fried rice, the sauce was tasty and veggies crisp and fresh.  The fried rice was litely flavored- not heavily oily or filled with peas and carrots,  actually a nice compliment to the chicken and veggies.  The other dish was beef and broccoli in a spicy black bean sauce, and spicy it was!! The broccoli was crisp and fresh and sauce was nicely captured in the veggies- not soupy or overly cloing the flavor of the meat and veggies.  We had this served with brown rice which was very well cooked, again the flavor was allowed to peak through.  Very nice dinner all around, good food, nice cozy atmosphere and friendly staff.",

There are no fancy options - only pho, straight up. The bowl comes with soup and rice noodles with flank steak and sliced meatballs. You can customize by asking for one or the other protein option, but the regular order comes with both. My favorite part is the broth. It's not heavily spiced. Just a nice, clean broth that's punching with strong flavor.   Of course the regular accoutrements come with (sprouts, basil, jalapeno, etc.).  I enjoy it when I'm eating it.

    "text": "In my ongoing quest to find fantastic Chinese food in Charlotte, I thought I'd try this out after searching around on Yelp.   I went for the lunch specials list and decided it's pretty difficult to screw up cashew chicken. It came with an egg roll and I opted for the brown rice.   Egg roll: I got this to-go, so the egg roll was kinda soft and not crunchy by the time I got back to the office. I wasn't surprised, so not a problem. The container of duck sauce that came with it was quite tasty -- unfortunately the best flavor of the box it all came in. The egg roll itself had minimal flavor. Of course, it was hidden by the tasty sauce...   Brown Rice: Is this stuff fried? I'm not quite sure why there looked to be tiny pieces of egg in it. It also didn't seem to be very brown. But, rice is rice and worked well with the food.   Cashew Chicken: I wasn't quite sure why it looked so orange. Maybe that chicken had been soaking in the sauce for a while? But if that was the case, it should have had more flavor. There's a good variety of veggies and the portion of cashew chicken was plenty, but the flavor was missing. There was also a good layer of oil on top of the sauce at the bottom of the container my food was swimming in. Standard amount of broccoli. A few large mushroom halves. A few big chunks of green pepper. A handful of cabbage. A great amount of tender, thinly sliced chicken. How can such a combination be so devoid of flavor though? For a moment, I felt like everything was steamed and I was eating healthy... and then I saw the caoting of oil molesting the rest of the sauce.   Fortune cookie: Crunchy. With a disappointing fortune: \"Focus in on the color yellow tomorrow for good luck!\" I can hardly wait until I have to pee in the morning!  Look, I've had worse, but I've had a lot better, too. I ate it, but am not in a rush to go back. If you don't mind bland, the ingredients all tasted fresh and were cooked right. If I were to go back, I might dump that egg roll sauce on top of it.",

    "text": "This just became my go-to spot for Asian food in Charlotte. The service was impeccable! Staff were friendly and our food came out quickly.   We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and steamed pork dumplings to start. The dumplings were okay; the sauce and filling both could have been more flavorful. The lettuce wraps shone in comparison though. It was a sizable and very flavorful appetizer.   For an entree I ordered the vegetarian spicy Kung Pao with tofu. It was a little spicy, perfect for my taste. There were lots of vegetables and it was a generous serving.  Overall, my husband and I were very pleased! our bill was less than $40, including the tip, which is rare for us. We will definitely be going back soon!",

    "text": "So, seeing the great reviews on Persuasian, and knowing the location is only a few minutes away, I was so excited to check it out. After two recent visits I wasn't as impressed as others, sorry. First visit was an early dinner so I just had the shrimp fried rice. Sadly, nothing to run back for. The rice was good, veggies okay, but I felt the shrimp was probabaly frozen. I wanted to give them another shot for an entree so went this past Thursday and ordered the vegetable egg roll, wonton soup and chicken with mixed veggies. The egg roll, one of the most bland egg rolls I have ever had. It was cabbage only with an overwhelming flavor of pepper and served with an absolutely extreme mustard sauce, ugh. Spit it out and passed on that one. The wonton soup had a good broth, however I felt it needed a little more flavor. And, the wontons, there was no pork inside, just raw wontons, another ugh! The chicken and veggies was good, finally a Chinese restaurant that serves fresh chicken. The veggies were good, but the brown sauce was a little greasy, and the bottom of my plate reflected that. Overall, things were good, but I did have higher hopes and wished  for a great place in Dilworth as we are very limited now.",

We'd driven by a few times and honestly didn't know this place existed, so this one is all Yelp.  We arrived to find the place quiet. It is tastefully decorated for the most part, with a nice bookshelf and stylish touches, though they apparently didn't prime before painting. Atmosphere: OK.  We ordered off of their mercifully compact menu. It's straightforward and that is a 180 from most places that serve this kind of food. My wife ordered the moo shu pork and I had the General's spicy chicken. She said that the pork was among the best she's had and I found the chicken to be flavorful with a spicy note that comes in late. Both dishes were simple, but well-prepared, properly seasoned and very tasty.The food was hot, temperature-wise, but not so hot that it could not be eaten immediately, which is also refreshing.  It seems to be a place with a simple recipe: quality food, quick and simple with none of the sometimes-bizarre ethnic trappings. Service was very friendly and communicative. Will go here again for sit-down Chinese food. I want to try something off their hibachi.",

Thought I would give it another chance since we have been eating from here for years. I knew as soon as my \"go to\" dish hit the table that it looked different. Nothing like it has tasted before-dry and way spicer than before. Wait staff was kind enough to let me order something else (after I was told that I should expect it to be a little spicy--I'm aware--I've been eating the same thing for a while). Second dish was basic pad thai because I figured it was an americanized version anyway and you couldn't screw that up. It was very boring and dry and the broccoli was way undercooked. The waitperson did tell me there was a new chef in the back. Maybe that's it---I hope they figure it out soon. The fried jalapenos were delish and the spring roll was good as well. I would hate for Persuasian to lose its edge in this market on this side of town. Based on other conversations I've had over the past couple of days, our experience is not unique. Hope they are not circling the drain! Here's to hoping yours is better.",

Super excited for our meal, we drove 5 minutes home and began to chow down. The soups were good, but the chicken (sesame chicken, spicy General Tso's) was mushy and what disappointed me the most was the fried rice. It had absolutely no flavor :(   I wanted to badly to like this place! Super bummed but I don't think we'll be coming back. Baoding is still #1 for us!",

I sat at the bar and per the bartender's suggestion ordered the sauteed Thai Basil Shrimp. It was excellent with just enough of a kick of spicy from the chile that was included in prep.   For dessert, the fried cheesecake is awesome  and unique, served with French vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. It's a big helping - good for sweet tooths like me or to split between two people.  The clientele is what sets this place apart though. I came in at 8:30 on a Sunday night and there were regulars sitting at the bar, eating and drinking. It wasn't long until I was looped into conversations and felt like a regular myself. I met nearly all the staff on hand as well as all the patrons. Never have I felt more welcomed in a restaurant. I will be back - soon.",

On the floor the tables are nicely spaced with plenty of room to enjoy your meal and the overall decor is really inviting; it has a little bit of library or bookstore feel - in a good way!   The menu is extensive and by now we've tried almost everything and each & every dish is tasty. You \"could\" skip the main courses and eat all night from the appetizer list and be happy (and full!).  I love the fried jalapenos. Try the Pho at lunch or the salt & pepper shrimp as an evening appetizer with a glass of cold chardonnay.  The wine and beer list is also wide-ranging and well priced.   The staff are amazing. You will feel so welcome.  There is a link with the Zen Fusion restaurant and Peruasian has got the same magical appeal that will make you come back again and again.

Starter always has to be the Crab Rangoon which is amazing! Homemade andcrispy but not burnt with plenty of crab.  So delicious.  I would also suggest the pork dumplings as well.  For entrees I go with the spicy generals chicken.  Highly recommend this dish because it is always crispy on the outside and not \"soggy\" like you will find sometimes.  My girlfriend always gets the pad Thai which is also some of the best you will find in Charlotte. I always have to get a few bites of her dish :)  Looking for great service and great Chinese food then look no more.",

There were only a few tables open when we walked in but, luckily, we did not have to wait at 8:30p. I wasn't really a fan of our server, she wasn't as pleasant as I would have liked (I guess I'm excusing it, who wants to work on Christmas Eve) and she wasn't very attentive throughout our time there. In fact, another server had to take over the service for her, our actual server only came to pick up the bill. The other server was very nice and attentive.   We ordered a bottle of pear sake, the chicken lettuce wraps, the Singaporean curry noodles, and a thai basil chicken entree. Our original server forgot to grab our sake bottle, I had to wave down the nice Asain server and have her grab it. The lettuce wraps came out quick and everything was fresh. The chicken itself had a good basic flavor but was kind of bland though, needed some spice and salt. Sadly this carried into the entrees as well. The Singaporean curry noodles we're my favorite but it needed more curry flavor and more spice. The thai basil chicken was too sweet for me. Total came to about $43, not too bad given the amount ordered. I did appreciate the freshness of the ingredients, props. Everything had a great crunch, including the veggies.   All in all, it was a good meal. Kitchen staff, up the umphf in your dishes. Don't be afraid of seasoning!",

Stepping inside you always get the feeling of being inside someone's house - the restaurant is adorned with bookshelves and some subtle ornery show pieces. It's just a warm feeling to be in such an ambience. The only downside being the tables are small and so close together that a gentle around can end up in looking directly into someone else's face. Surprisingly enough the restaurant also accommodates a bar.  The menu is as any other Asian restaurant - pho, lo mien and rice dishes nevertheless it has a section where you can customize your sauce and protein. There were only two staffs, one waiting tables and one at the bar. We ordered some custom sauces and rice and it didn't long for our food to reach us. The taste of the sauces is just something your tongues would please. The dishes are not to oily or watery. The quantity is apt and the not so expensive with a dinner for two with appetizers mind end up with 25-30$. If you are around Charlotte, you should definitely check out this place for the warmth of the good food.",

Food is top notch, is available for take-out and at a really great price! And the wine selection is really good, especially for a casual Chinese restaurant. But what keeps me coming back time and time again are the people at the restaurant. The service is wonderful. I feel like they take such pride in their service and good care of their customers. It is a wonderful place to meet many Dilworth neighbors and regulars. I highly recommend!",

Even if you're not a regular, Joey, May, Chi and everyone else there will make you feel welcomed and makes you want to come back.   I only been here for lunch, but they are in my weekly rotation... heavily. They have a mix of Chinese, Thai, & Vietnamese dishes on the menu. So you can be basic and get the basic Chinese dishes like fried rice, general chicken, sesame chicken, lo mein noodles etc. But don't be basic, try the other dishes they offer, since they also have Pad Thai noodles or pick a protein and get that stir fried in a Thai basil sauce. Or try out their Vietnamese pho with your pick of beef, chicken, tofu or shrimp. Honestly whatever way you go, you really can't go wrong..... hmmm, honestly, I got a confession. I've become basic myself while coming here for almost 2 years for lunch. I did try most of the lunch dishes and my go to is either beef pho on cold wet days like today. Or it's the chicken in spicy garlic sauce. I need to take off these uggs, trash my Starbucks, and throw down my scarf. The next time I come here, I will switch it up and try something new. So if you're in the dilworth/south end area stop by Persuasian for the food and stay for the conversation. I highly doubt you'll be disappointed.",

Persuasion is a quaint neighborhood restaurant with a basic Chinese-american menu (fried wontons, sesame chicken, ubiquitous lunch special with white/fried rice, etc.).  My waiter, Chi, was enjoyable and engaging without becoming my buddy--she's a real asset.  I ordered the pho after I asked for a recommendation.  It was good but I prefer more umami so I amped it with hoison and siracchi sauce.  That helped bunches (I think they either don't use or lay low on palm sugar).  Either way, I'd order it again.  Nice little place but I would like to see more authentic Asian-inspired food, if only as a daily special.  I think the neighborhood is hip enough to expand our palettes!",

    "text": "My daughter and I happened upon this place on our Sunday walk and decided to stop in for lunch.  Opened only a few weeks ago.  Father/son team where Dad cooks in the kitchen and the son works up front.  I think they both came from Zen Fusion and now are out on their own.    Ultra-friendly service from the son.  He spent time talking to us, finding our likes and tastes preferences and made recommendations based on that.    As for the food...They have set the bar for Chinese food in Charlotte.  I ordered the Kung Pao vegetables and my daughter ordered lo mein noodles with shrimp, but plain otherwise.  They completely catered the dish to what she wanted.  When he saw me douce my plate in Sriracha (yes, it's on the table) he made a recommendation to next time let them know I like it spicy and his dad can use fresh chiles.    The spring roll was made in house and the time commitment is worth the results.  Much better than places that just use frozen rolls.  I could have ordered an entire plate of spring rolls.    My daughter tends to be a picky eater and normally I have to battle to get her to touch her food.  She almost cleared her plate.  The next day she even talked about how much she liked it.    I can't say enough wonderful things about this place.  I'm so happy they opened and can't wait for many returns.  YUM!!!",

The fried rice was good, but both of the chicken dishes were soft and soggy with sauce, with liquid pooled in the bottom. Neither of the sauces had strong or distinct flavors, either, and came off as pretty bland. Experience may be better if you're eating in, but wasn't memorable for take-out.",

I loved that they had a mix of classic Chinese and Vietnamese dishes and pick and choose options.   This is so minuscule, but I loved how they brought out our egg rolls before our meal, almost as an appetizer. I also got a salad - although I was sad there was not some sort of ginger dressing, it was still a decent size with a nice, house balsamic. My entree was the ginger sauce with chicken with brown rice. It was the perfect portion, filled with veggies and I still had leftovers. The sauce was sweet and not spicy, reminding me of a bourbon sauce. Next time, I definitely want to try a middle enter.",

The restaurant was quite busy and my group of 4 had to wait for about 15-20 minutes to be seated. The server felt bad that we had to wait so long and was SO nice -- the service here is top-notch. The space contains a cozy dining area and bar and has a low-key yet intimate vibe.  We started out with steamed pork dumplings and wonton soup for the table. The dumplings were delicious and the soup was piping hot and not excessively salty like other wonton soups I've had before. The entrees here are quite large, so we ordered 3 dishes to share between 4 people. The orange chicken was absolutely fabulous and I would definitely order this dish again! The Thai basil shrimp stir-fry was also delicious -- I especially loved the sauce. The ginger white wine stir-fry was solidly okay -- unfortunately the sauce wasn't very flavorful. My only other criticism was that some of the vegetables in the stir-fry dishes seemed undercooked. But overall, the food was delicious and I left feeling quite satisfied.",

Now, I know that typically the \"best\" stuff comes from the hole in the wall type establishment, but we have broadened our horizons and trying to find \"the one.\"   Persuasian is not \"the one\" for us though. An order of General Tsao Chicken and Tofu Vegetable with Fried Rice and a Spring Roll just wasn't what we were expecting. I'm not sure how to explain it, but nothing seemed right about our orders. The Spring Rolls were the best part IMO. They had a super crunchy texture and they packed with veggies.   I think we will be taking our tour of take-out around the city before we come back to Persuasian.  *Nothing was wrong with the food, it's just nothing stood out. Nothing said, THIS IS THE PLACE. Sometimes the General Tsao packs a punch and it should, but it was just chicken with sauce. The Tofu was a little on the slimy side.",

The decor is whimsical with a bookcase and quirky little odds and ends to fill it.   You cannot beat the lunch menu. For less than $10 you get an entree, egg roll and can add a soup or salad. Price is absolutely awesome and it's a big portion of food. I had leftovers! I love that with the sauteed entrees you have multiple choices in terms of both protein and the sauce it is cooked in. I recommend the white wine and ginger sauce if you're looking for something lighter. Food was fresh, tasty and HOT. Great quality.  They do have a full bar and a separate dinner menu to select from. If you're looking for sit-down Chinese food, make sure you stop by!",

The edamame is really delicious as well as the house noodles. I thought the sesame chicken was pretty good and the dumplings, decent. My favorite thing to order when getting Chinese is the crab Rangoon and I am disappointed. The flavor is really great but they put such a small amount of the crab and cream cheese mixture in each one. My favorite thing about this place is that you can order a bottle of wine! Win! Ha.

For some reason mike other restaurants the chicken has grown. Like hormone growth looking wings. And this place.... it's now just 6 wing pieces. So not a whole wing and leg but three each of those pieces.  That sucks because I would get these joints and some donuts from joes... AND GO IN!   No more of that. No more chasing chicken dishes.

The chicken was cooked perfect, and not deep fried. The entree was loaded with broccoli and had the right about of sauce on it. On the other hand, my husband got the General's Chicken and thought it was delicious. The breading was light and didn't over power the chicken. Again, it was also served hot and fresh!  We also got an order of egg rolls and they were really delicious and a pretty good size. The food was fresh and still hot when I opened it when I got home.   The only thing I didn't care for was their egg drop soup. It was a little too blah to me - not enough egg and more of a clearer broth. It was OK, nothing special.   Also, if you order online via the Chow Now app, you will get 20% off your first order!",

It wasn't spicy, which is fine for me, but if you want some heat you need to request it. One order was enough for two adults. It had broccoli in it, which is different. $10 is a good price and it was worth it. They are quick with their take out. I waited less than 10 minutes.   As for the pork rolls, they weren't really worth it. $5 for two where other places give you four spring rolls for the same price. I get it they have meat in them, but they weren't that great. Next time I'll just get the veggie spring rolls. Online ordering was easy. It's pretty nice inside as well, even though the outside of the building is unassuming. Yelp asked if the place was romantic. I answered yes because it is cozy and the servers seem nice. It could definitely be a nice first date spot.   I'm giving it 5 stars even though I didn't enjoy the pork rolls. First time ordering always comes with the caveat that you might not like what you order. That's on me, not the restaurant.",

I was greeted promptly by the server, she was super nice and attentive throughout lunch.  She told me her favorite was a couple of noodle dishes and the black bean sauce.  So I took her advice and ordered chicken with black bean sauce, you may also add three chicken wings for $1.50 to your lunch.  Can I get a hell yeah?   My lunch was great, I tried my friend's noodle dish and it was delicious too!  I'm like, SOLD this will be my Chinese go to!  My lunch was $11 with wings and hot tea added.

We got the summer rolls, lo mein noodles, a stir fry dish in garlic sauce, and also the lettuce wraps with shrimp. The noodles were A+, the summer rolls and lettuce wraps were an A, and the stir fry in garlic cause a B+. The sauce in my opinion, was a little on the blander side, which made it perfect for the kid, but I'll probably try a different one next time.

Incredibly solid and even better with soy sauce. I don't even like peas and I love their rice. On the reheat? Amazing.   Singapore Curry Noodles? Hold their flavor well without being overpowering.   Spicy General's Chicken? Best I've had in forever.  The Szechuan dumplings are always yummy. My cousin loves the steamed ones and they're good, but the fried ones are where it's at for me!  My favorite thing, though? They have created a Kung Pao edamame. I literally just ate it for dinner. The spice is perfect!   The service: Even though the food is phenomenal, the service is still the best part of the experience by far. Chi, May and the rest of their staff will give up an experience you'll never forget. They're attentive, quick and absolutely hilarious. And they'll remember you the next time you come back. And the time after that, too.  Don't go anywhere else if you're in the area. You're doing yourself a disservice. You're not going to do better than Persuasian.  **If you really want to have some fun, try the spicy chilled cucumbers! If it sounds crazy, just trust me.**",

    "text": "I frequent to restaurants often and used to live in a city filled of wonderful ethnic cuisines (Houston, TX).  We love going to Lang Van; however, since we moved out of NODA to Dilworth area, there wasn't a lot of options.  Google had Persuasion at a 4.3 stars so we gave it a shot. We were fairly DISAPPOINTED. The customer service and the restaurant ambiance (clean restaurant and clean bathroom, great date night lighting) was on point; however, the food was HORRIBLE. IT was VERY BLAND. $30 for 2 appetizers and 2 entrees wouldn't be a bad deal if we could stomached the food. The steam dumplings was the ONLY GOOD thing we ate there; however, if you buy a frozen dumpling bag from Trader Joes, it would taste similar. The Kung Pao Edamame taste bland- the sauce wasn't soaked in the edamame long enough. I'm Vietnamese and know what PHO tastes like. The broth and the ingredients provided in addition to the noodle bowl was a joke. It was like water down beef broth. Since the weather has been a bit chilly, a bowl of Pho would hit the spot. This Pho bowl made me want to run the other direction. I was utterly DISAPPOINTED. My boyfriend order the Chicken Pad Thai, the sauce taste water down. I'm not sure if this is a gimmick for this restaurant to save costs to serve water down sauces in their dishes. The waiter noticed we barely ate our food and did not provide any alternative (comp our meal or ask if we wanted to order something else instead). I DEIFINTELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this restaurant.",

    "text": "Hi.  I give 3.5, but don't know how! Nice lunch-  we tried steamed dumplings. Tasty but when I asked if they were homemade, the wait person said. \" no \"... One of my pet peeves since we can all buy dumplings these days from Costco, HT, Trader Joe's etc. My friend and I shared shrimp with garlic sauce... Nice flavor overall, but shrimp had that frozen/ peel- n-eat taste and texture... Watery and bland, rather than rich and chewy.  This shrimp problem is way to common in our Queen City.   We also shared chicken with black bean sauce . Sauce was tangy and good - broccoli  was fresh and crunchy. The chicken was thinly sliced but texture/ taste not great.   I like good chicken such as Ashley Farms' so maybe this is just typical chicken from mass- produced factory. I haven't bought a Purdue type product in years. Our taste buds adapt.   Well I hope I will like this more in future! I'll try again... Brown rice was good...  So was  egg roll. Cute looking place with books on shelves!",

    "text": "Growing up eating pho for most of my life I was weary of trying it here. To my surprise it was excellent! I love the pho! I've eaten here many times and tried something new each time.  The black bean sauce is great. I like it with beef or shrimp personally. And the chef is kind as to leave out the bell peppers for me and put in extra broccoli. The bar has an excellent selection of wines. I enjoy both red and white and at $6-7 a glass, you can't beat that. The service is great, the price won't hurt your wallet, the atmosphere is relaxed and casual and I haven't had anything on the menu that I don't like. This is definitely a place to try. This is my new favorite spot to go to.",

    "text": "From reading prior reviews I wish I tried dining in! Maybe my experience would have been different but unfortunately I opted for take out due to a long night of work. I ordered the general tso chicken entree and my fiancee ordered the sesame chicken entree. First thing I noticed was very little sauce to where the chicken basically looked like chicken tender bites. I've worked as a chef for over ten years and will always give places a try regardless of reviews. I just want to help someone out before they deal with the frustration my fiancee and I dealt with. The chicken was rock hard and and hard one of the most bizarre textures I've tasted. You can tell it was real chicken which is a plus but it tasted like they either par cook a bunch of chicken prior to the shift, cook a bunch and put them under heat lamps or they let it sit in the fryer for much longer then it should. I tried 3 bites and called it quits. My fiancee was a bit more hard headed and tried picking at hers which caused her to be violently sick the next two days having to call out of work. She called for a refund and the lady who answers the phone became a bodyguard when my fiancee asked for a refund. My fiancee was in tears after the lady hung up on her. At this point I am blown away that someone who runs a restaurant would let this happen because reputation/word of mouth is everything in a business. I called back and the lady proceeded to hang up on me a few times in a row. Toss in her telling me \"it's not her problem\" \"she doesn't have to do anything since we signed the credit card receipt\". After yet another call she handed the phone to the manager who was more then kind and immediately handled the situation offering a full refund. It's just disappointing because I try to give the benefit of the doubt and would have tried it again because the atmosphere inside is very homey but not at this point. It even upset me enough to make a Yelp account and post this. I hope no one else has to feel this way. It will always blow my mind why people who dislike people work in customer service. It only takes one bad employee who has no relation to the food to ruin it for someone.",
