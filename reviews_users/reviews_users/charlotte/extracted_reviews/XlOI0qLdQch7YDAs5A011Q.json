The cheese curds have gone downhill since the last time I went.  Being from Wisconsin I consider myself somewhat of an unofficial expert on these.  The latest trip the cheese, what little there was of it, was over shadowed by all the extra fried dough.  Half the basket was just the fried dough instead of curds.  If this is their new recipe than I'm gonna have to pass from now on.",

Our waitress was prompt and stopped by to check on us often.   We ordered the jalapeno bacon firecrackers to start. We make a similar version at home. They were good but SO hot my mouth was on fire for too long. I did like how crispy the bacon was. Next time I'll opt for the brew cheese & pretzels.   I ordered the Rocket Turkey burger on a whole wheat bun with a side of fries. Honestly the best turkey burger I've had. It wasn't, like many I've had, a frozen patty but was actually ground turkey, farm raised at that! The combination of goat cheese, arugula, roasted red peppers, & balsamic fig spread was amaaazing. Will definitely order again. The fries were just how I like them, crisp but not burnt or hard.   My bf ordered a BYOB, that he demolished & the bleu buffalo fries. Omg. Those fries! I'm a sucker for buffalo sauce and these fries were coated in it with a generous amount of bleu cheese crumbles on top. The best part, even with all the buffalo sauce the fries weren't soggy.   They also have a ton of beers on tap, huge plus! Needless to say we will be back !",

I got a chicken sandwich, and I really wasn't expecting it to be that great since it is a burger joint and all. But it was really good. And when we ordered the rosemary and thyme fries, we didn't like the seasoning on them at all and the server was very nice about it and offered to give us just plain fries in place for them.   The only reason I give it 4 stars is the beer prices. They are a little overpriced considering the area, I could walk right down the block and pay $3 less for the same pint of beer. But other than that, for a good bite to eat it's a great place to go!",

I came in with my boyfriend and sister on a Saturday evening. It was packed, both inside and outside on the (cute) patio. Unfortunately the seating is fairly limited due to M&B working with a small space. The hostess took our number and told us it would be around half an hour before seating became available. During our wait, not even five minutes in, a gentleman came outside to us and asked if we minded being in close quarters with one another. We laughed and said we are family so no, we don't mind. He said they had a little corner table by a window and it shares a bench with another table. He asked one of us to come with him to see it before we said yes, just so he could ensure we would be comfortable. The table was perfect for us and we definitely recognize his goal was to please us and all of his customers, he was such a cool and pleasant guy.   Once seated we selected our beers and had the M&B cold platter (black bean hummus, pimento cheese, carrots, cucumbers, flatbread) to start. It was the perfect size for the three of us to share and was delicious. After devouring that in an instant, we went on to select our burgers. My sister was able to swap the beef burger for a black bean burger on the \"brew raised shroom and swiss\", which was awesome that they accommodate for people's desires and/or needs. My boyfriend had the salmon burger and did not talk almost the entire time because he was focused on his enjoyment of the flavor, and I had the Fresh Produce burger. I cannot say how much I L.O.V.E. when I consume a black bean burger that is FRESH and does NOT taste like they went to Costco and bought bulk frozen patties. It had great flavor and spice and the toppings were so delicious (I mean come on... avocado, pepper jack, fresh herb aioli.... heavenly). I was the only one to get the sweet potato fries at the table and I can tell you right now: the best I have ever had. I could have eaten 4x the amount and not even felt guilty about it. Just the perfect sweetness/crunch and dipped into the honey mustard sauce you get with them you'll never want to order another type of fry again. It will be a struggle for me to veer away and try to \"up my fry game\" next time with one of their many other options.   We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The only negative to the night was when the waitress had a mood swing and ended up getting extremely agitated and irritable for about 3/4 of our time there. I did not dock the review for this, trying to be understanding that it was a busy Saturday night and I am sure she had been through it. Hopefully this will not be experienced again. My boyfriend and I will be back and we urge everyone to support this business!",

I had a spicy burger which was cooked medium.  The bacon wrapped around the pepper inside was a little disappointing.  It was not crispy and was in fact, pretty undercooked and soggy.  The idea of the burger was pretty good, it just didn't come out the way I had hoped.  I finished really fast and got out of there because of the heat.  It was really miserable to sit on the inside of a restaurant and feel so hot and sweaty.  Uncomfortable and it def gave me a headache.  I may try this place again-NOT recommended for summertime.

I never could find the time but I heard that food network was filming so I decided to make that the reason I finally go lol. I got there around 11 am abs there was no immediate parking . I'll blame they on the fact that filming was going on. I ended up parking about a block way. When I got inside there was no wait. I opted to sit outside which was a bad idea only because it was a bit windy that day and I get cold very easily! Next time I'll stay inside. I ordered the moo and brew burger I believe it was called and sweet potato fries. The burger came with chili and cheese and I wanted it well done. The sweet potato fries were a nice addition. Since it was 11am I ordered a ginger ale to drink! Even though they were filming the wait for the food was not long at all! My waiter was extremely attentive and I left full and happy. They do have a signature drink there that I will try the next time I go. It's very instagramable (maybe that's not s word lol) Anyway this place is definitely a must try if you are in the Charlotte area and I'm sure when you see it on food network soon you will see I tell no lies lol.",

We decided to eat here the other night, and I was so glad we did! We started with some beers. They have a great local selection, but also have other beers you don't find as much that were good to try.   I ordered the Turkey burger as prompted by the waitress, and boy was she right. The turkey burger was moist (what a concept!) and perfectly cooked. I loved the peppers and goat cheese on the burger. We also ordered the rosemary, truffle fries and the sweet potato fries. Both of the fries were exceptional! Really some of the better fries I have had. Perfectly crisp and not too greasy.   Overall, it was the perfect spot for the evening. We went on a Friday evening before Christmas, so it wasn't very packed at all. It seems to have a nice patio and we were able to find a parking spot in the lot right away.

Stopped in for a quick burger and beer with a friend who was helping me move into the area on Sunday. +1 for having a parking lot and luckily available parking when I pulled in!   Sometimes staff in 'hip' restaurants can be a bit pretentious, but not at Moo and Brew the staff were amazing from start to end. The guys at the door were funny and made us feel super comfortable, almost like we were regulars! The waitress was attentive and even remembered the exact type of beer I had when she asked if I wanted a second round! I know that might be of minimal importance to some, but after a few lackluster service experience this week in Charlotte, it was greatly appreciated.  Prices were reasonable, especially if you build your own burger the base price is $6 and goes up based on topping choices. Definitely know where to go when my budget gets a little tight!   Oh and try the Good Morning Vietnam from Wooden Robot, great beer!",

    "text": "More Brew, less Moo.  I was so excited about this local burger place, but it came up a few dollars short. The location is primo and the few times we've been there the brews have been flowing.   The Brew: The beer selection is from the best of the best local and they are constantly changing their taps. Moo & Brew has a featured brewery of the month, too.   The Moo: This is where it came up short. I know a good burger when I see one, and each burger I've ordered hasn't knocked my socks off. I was really hankering a veggie burger and after confirming with the staff the black bean burgers are frozen (not made in-house/fresh) which is ironic considering the name of the burger: Fresh Produce, I opted for the Rocket Turkey. Now, I cannot confirm that the turkey burger is made in-house/fresh, but the accompaniments: goat cheese, arugula, fig spread and roasted red pepper sounded like it would pair beautifully. Again, it was a 7.5/10 it didn't blow me away but was decent. I felt the same with I ordered the Way out West Bison BUrger and swapped the bison patty for the Salmon patty. The accompaniments sound delightful and I am starting to salivate while writing this, but again the burger was just coming up short.   Everything else: The fries is why I will come back. It doesn't matter if you upgrade that order or just go with the classic, these fries are what will hook you. Fire green tomatoes, a Southern staple, and Moo & Brew is making them right.  The staff is friendly and they have an awesome patio out front and a great spot for yard games. This is a great spot if you have pets.",

    "text": "I've been to Moo & Brew about five times now so I think I'm more than due for a review. Let's start off with the scene: they have a nice outdoor set-up with some communal tables, some bar-height seating, and some individual tables. You can order drinks at the walk-up window, which is fun. They have a big awning that they set up in the summer so you don't suffer in the scorching sun.  Inside is usually a bit loud. There are a number of TVs, a bar, and many tables of varying heights. Some fun memorabilia. It's a definitively FUN, relaxed atmosphere.  I love their waitstaff. The women in particular are so friendly and welcoming. Anyone will be happy to talk you their vast beer selection. And man, do they have a GREAT variety of beers. I'm not much of a beer gal but I know enough to recognize how awesome their spread is. They also have some wine (not great) and some cocktails. They are infamous for their outlandish bloody mary. If you want your bloody to come with food on top, Moo & Brew is the place.  Finally, onto the food. The pickins' as moderately slim for a vegetarian. Their cold platter is delicious. Those lavash crackers - YUM. I've only ever gotten the fire cobb salad, sometimes with a veggie burger on top. ALWAYS get it with the adobo ranch. I love that dressing so much. It's definitely not a healthy salad, but boy is it yummy.  The veggie burger, which can be customized into whatever you want, is good. I've grown a bit weary of the black bean style, but I do appreciate that theirs is homemade. I recommend ordering it as is on the menu, but the customization options are endless. Their fries are great. The sweet potato fries are a solid 7.5/10. The parmesan fries, however, blew my mind. They are completely addictive. Love those fries.  Overall, it's a solid neighborhood joint. I will always admire Moo & Brew for its strong spirit and happy waitstaff. They also regularly host events which seem very well-received. So I'm sure I will soon be back!",

    "text": "Been meaning to stop by this place for awhile now. There are so much good things to rave about.  Drinks - they had a huge selection of beers, including a ton from local breweries. I went with the Raspberry Wit from Sugar Creek (which was awesome) and my boyfriend had the Peach Cider from Windy Hill (he loved it). We got a good amount for the price, too, which is always a win.   Apps- we went with the cheese curds. I only had a few because I can't do a lot of dairy (and this meal was HEAVY on dairy) but they were soooooo good! I would definitely get these again and again and again and again. My boyfriend wants to try to the pork rinds next time but I ain't eating that, so he's on his own there.  Burgers- my boyfriend had the farmers daughter burger and loved it. I had a build you own black bean burger. I'll be honest, it was just okay. Here's the thing, I'm not a crazy meat lover. I will eat a good steak but for the most part, don't want to eat a lot of meat. The black bean burger was great on flavor but fell apart when I would try to pick it up and eat it. I ended up just eating with a fork. Both burgers came on a Martin's Potato Roll, which... I mean...who doesn't love those!?!?!  Fries- we made the mistake of ordering two separate fries to share. We got the nacho fries (my boyfriend loved them, they were a bit much for me) and the rosemary garlic fries (we both loved). However, this was a ton of food! We did not even eat 1/4 of either of them. Tip: just share fries with your boo there.   Service- our server, Matt, was great. He was friendly, welcoming, helpful and made our experience super enjoyable.   Price- I feel like this place was somewhat overpriced. We spent over $50, which is a bit more than I think it was worth.   All in all, for a splurge burger spot - this place is solid. We will definitely be back.",

Annnnnd, more fries of the rosemary truffle variety, these with garlic aioli.   Their beer selection was fantastic and I appreciate they offer flights.

I would give the service 4-stars by itself.   I had the \"farmers daughter\" burger with fries and it was top notch. The burger was cooked great with a delicious egg, bacon and perfect bun.

    "text": "I stopped by Moo & Brew on a Wednesday evening for dinner and a few beers - it was delightful!  The venue looks great - plenty of seats at the bar, mix of low top and high top tables and a large patio out front.  It also looks like they are prepping the side for additional outdoor seating and walk-up bar.  The parking lot is small - this may be an issue on busy nights, but was not a problem while we were there.  We sat at the bar to get a first hand look at the 40ish taps.  Wow, what a great selection of beer!  There were several options that I haven't seen anywhere else - this alone makes this an awesome addition to the n'hood.  On Tuesday nights, you can get $5 blue cups (from He's Not Here in Chapel Hill - 32 oz.) of PBR.  Typically I don't drink PBR - but, put it in a $5 blue cup and I may change my mind.  If not, for a $3 upcharge, you can have OMB Copper, Lagunitas IPA or Sweetwater 420.  The also have a Midwood Mule on tap with Tito's vodka - it's heavy on the ginger, giving it a nice spicy finish.  For food, you have a selection of gourmet burgers and salads - or you can build your own starting with the bread type (including a gluten-free option), cheese, meat, toppings and sauces.  I opted for a salmon burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, bacon, avocado and herb aioli - YUM, YUM, YUM!  My partner went with the bison burger - very, very tasty.  For my side, I ordered the sweet potato fries.  OMG - Sweet. Potato. Fries.  I'm not obsessive over much, but these fries were incredible.  Seriously, incredible.  Thick slices of potato that were perfectly crispy on the outside.  These fries were enough for me to keep coming back.  The bartenders were attentive and friendly.  I'm thrilled to have this option in Plaza Midwood.",

We ordered a build your own burger and sweet potato fries. Fries - DELICIOUS and definitely get the M&B sauce, winner! Apparently the skinny bun equates to a mini roll bun so the meat exceeds bout an inch.  Sounds great, low carbs, right? Until you contemplate how to eat it.  No worries because it was fantastic, fresh and juicy.   Don't mind workers eating at the establishment; however, do not eat amongst patrons wearing the \"uniform\".  Simply, it's in poor taste.

Cheese curds- warm, gooey, fried cheese, that is as delectable as it sounds. The sauce is a type of cheese marinara and it is wonderful.  Not your farmers daughter burger- with a fried egg and peppered bacon and cheddar cheese you cannot go wrong. I'm not sure what is in their housemate m+b sauce but it compliments the burger nicely.  Build your own burger- lots of good options and fresh ingredients Fries- really yummy and fresh  Buffalo and blue cheese fries- my new favorite dish. I could come here and just eat these all day long. I highly recommend adding these to your meal.  Beer- definitely recommend the flight. They had some great fruity options. I would highly recommend the watermelon beer.   The service could be better but it wasn't horrible.bit wouldn't stop us from coming again. Just a tip not to bring big groups here as it is a pretty small space. However, there is a nice patio deck with seating.",

I'm pregnant and can't have non fully cooked meat, so I thought this was a safe choice. I was horribly wrong. The turkey was completely raw inside. When we mentioned it to our server she immediately went to the kitchen and came back saying that they told her it's supposed to be pink because of the seasoning they add to the turkey. After we insisted it was raw, she went back with the sandwich this time, and came back to us saying yes, it was raw, and they would cook a new one. The new sandwich came and was deep fried in order to ensure that it was fully cooked. I did not want to eat a deep fried sandwich, nor should a turkey burger be deep fried. My husband told the general manager about this, no apology was given at all, only excuses that they add a red wine seasoning to the turkey thus the color, but did say they've had complaints all day about the same issue. I'll never go here again as this place is highly overrated.",

It wouldn't have been so bad if the food was really good, but I'd honestly rather eat a burger from five guys.  The fries were cold and soggy when brought out, and my burger was also cold when it came to the table, the table that had nothing to drink on it.  Maybe our the servers were taking smoke breaks or doing drugs or something, but they certainly weren't taking care of their customers.  The only thing decent about the place was the cheese fritters, which were ok, but nothing to write home about.  Last but not least, the \"dog-friendly\" patio was pretty annoying when people kept bringing their disobedient dogs who were constantly barking.  The dogs would have been a bit more tolerable if I was able to get some drinks.  I was there for an hour and a half and got 3 beers, two of which I had to flag or waitress down for because she wasn't paying attention.",

To start, I was with a larger party so we had to grab a beer at the bar and wait. When we checked in with the host, Bryant, he was honest about the wait time and recommended we grab a drink. The bartenders were attentive, knowledgeable and extremely accommodating. Bryant went above and beyond to keep our party in the loop on the progress of our wait and making sure we were happy. We waited about 20 minutes as promised, and upon being seated at our table, Jesse, our server, picked up right where the bartenders and Bryant left off. He was prompt with waters for the table and all of our specific needs for our orders came out flawless. The overall atmosphere at Moo & Brew is cool with a great local vibe and interesting decor. I would strongly recommend this spot, KUDOS to great service!!! We will be back!",

The waitress acknowledge us immediately and quickly got us our drink order and we ordered the fried pickles which were very good. However the cokes where very flat so disappointing. I ordered a buger built by me and ordered it medium well with a hot pink center. When my Burger came it was way over cooked and the truffle fries weren't hot. However, due to a thunder storm coming quickly I was unable to complain. If you are parking on the other side of central have you will have to pay 3.00 but if you send 20.00 or more it is taken off your ticket. Please remember to take a picture of your recipient tho. Overall the food wasn't bad but it was average. However, I'm going to give it one more try maybe I'll have better luck the next time. Our waitress made up for the experience.",

The spicy fries and the truffle fries were both just waaaaay over seasoned, the truffle drenched in truffle oil, the spicy with waay to much ghost pepper spice. The burgers are nothing to write home about, very bland no seasoning on the meat. I don't know if that's the norm, or if it was because the kitchen was backed up.

After about 20 minutes we were seated. We started off with the pork rinds and cheese curds. The pork rinds were great and spicy! They come in a larger portion, so there was plenty for 5 of us to share. The cheese curds were gooey good and so was the sun-dried tomato ranch they came with.   I got the Rocket Turkey burger. Yes, I got a turkey burger at a burger restaurant but I don't eat a lot of beef and I've been wanting to try this place since I've had it booked marked for months now. Soooo, get the rocket turkey! It's sooo juicy! I loved everything about it; goat cheese, fig spread and roasted red pepper on a potato bun. I would get it again in a heart beat! I also got it with the buffalo fries and a much needed side of ranch. Fries are hand-cut and yummy!  Our server, Evan was great like super great! She was constantly refilling our water, checking on us and did it all with a smile.",

    "text": "I was very eager to try this place due to the fact that it received high praise from people whose foodie opinions I trust. I love a good burger and always look forward to trying a new burger spot. We showed up on a Friday evening, around 6:00ish and was able to park ourselves right at the bar. M&B is a small spot, located not too far behind the shopping center that houses Bistro la bon and Family Dollar. There is very limited parking (we uber'd) but they do have a nice patio out front with an up close view of the nearby construction - #cranecity.  M&B has a very extensive beer list (lots of local drafts) as well as cocktails and wine options. I went with the Tropicmose (I may not have spelled that correctly) - very, very good - and ordered the jive turkey burger with rosemary, truffle fries. All listed burgers come with choice of fries, a choice of rosemary/truffle/sea salt, parmesan/garlic/olive oil, or chili loves cheese fries.  My burger was delicious and one that I absolutely would order again. My dining compatriot ordered a craft-your-own burger (rather, chicken sandwich) and got the parmesan fries. I was a HUGE fan of the parmesan and ended up eating more of those than the ones I ordered.  The various bartenders that night were very friendly and willingly offered up their own recommendations. They also made sure that we were satisfied with our meals and checked in on our need for refills.  This is a fun spot with good food and I hear it gets especially festive when there's a big game on.",

    "text": "Come here if you're looking for good burgers, a spin on fried pickles, and the most amazing Bloody Mary in Charlotte.   Fried pickle lovers, prepare to have your mind blown. Their twist on the classic is ADDICTIVE: pickled fried green tomatoes. These green tomatoes are the size of pickles but sooooo much better! Their batter recipe and special dipping sauce really make the appetizer what it is. You can't come here without getting them, it just wouldn't be right!  I really enjoy their Farmers Daughter burger, which has a over easy egg on top. But seriously, all their burgers are great. I recommend getting yours medium so it's not overcooked.   When it comes to brunch, the Large Marge is all you need. Served on Saturdays and Sundays this Bloody Mary will have you gawking. A full meal in itself, this 20 oz Bloody is filled with two generous shots of Titos vodka, and topped with an angus beef patty in between two grilled cheeses, a carrot, a celery stick, cheese curds, olives, a jalapeno popper, bacon, and fried green tomato. Not to mention it comes with a Miller High Life. This $18 Bloody is worth it because you get all that plus you get to take the glass home to prove you conquered the monster!   This place has limited space so they're very busy quite a lot. There's shaded patio space, which is really nice, booths inside, and high tops in the bar area. (PSA, this is Chapel Hills alumni bar.)",

    "text": "Moo and Brew! What a very catchy name! So catchy that my wife and I actually turned around to give it a shot. We were thinking... they must have good burgers and good beer! Right?  THE WAIT: It took the greeter about .9 seconds to greet us when we entered. It was kindy freaky because he appeared out of the blue like the butler on the Adam Sandler movie \"Mr. Deeds\". But it was very much appreciated seeing that it was my wife's birthday!  THE MENU: There is a decent amount of Burgers and a ton Beers to choose from at Moo and Brew. They stick to their name 100%. There was also a bar so I'm sure a mixed drink could be ordered as well. But with a name like that, I wanted to pair my burger with a succulent beer.  MY CHOICE: I chose the Moo and Brew burger (ordered it medium) with the a special order of Parmesan, garlic, and olive oil fries. They had me at chili and onions with mustard. Also, it had the name of the bar so I was thinking a win win! Our server also said it was a great choice and very popular. My wife chose the Peter Piper (ordered it medium) due to her desire for all things spicy with regular fries.  THE VERDICT: My burger was cooked perfectly and balanced with the best seasonal beer of all time! Seriously, it was a thing of Brew heaven. The bar tender delivered it personally and said, \"this is my favorite beer in the building. Enjoy\" (psst the beer is called 2XMas Spiced Double Ale by Southern Tier Brewing Co). My wife's burger on the other hand lacked flavor significantly.  Especially for a burger that has jalapeno and pepper jack cheese included. The burger was also below medium cooked. It's like that cow was still moo'in and wasn't as great as the Moo and Brew burger I had.  THE SERVICE AND AMBIENCE: Our server, who I remember the name of but will not disclose, was right at par. Not great but not bad either. She waited on a table sat after us before me and my wife (which is understandable, maybe she didn't see us sitting there first although they sat right next to us) they also received their food before us (again understandable), but what she missed was my wife's Birthday. We were out for her B Day, she checked her ID, and didn't say a word. I chuckled a bit really. Overall I gave her my standard tip (still above average) when she had the chance to get my 100% tip (yes I do this because I've been in the serving industry and I know how difficult it is).  It looks really nice inside for a burger and beer joint! Nice bar, retro themed restrooms, several tv screens that had the game on display, all while being reasonably priced.  TO SUM IT UP: It's a good spot for specialty burgers and beers. ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS. Good servers typically know what's good on the menu. I'll be giving it another try for sure.",

Correction: As a VEGETARIAN**, when I am craving a damn good burger this is the only place that will utterly satiate my needs. Believe me, I have tried many many non-meat burgers and this is my favorite in Charlotte.  Their black bean burger is the shiznit! Even if you aren't vegetarian, I would still recommend it. Obviously, I havent tried their meatier options but this place is always packed in the evenings and weekends so I think that alone speaks on its burgers.   Amazingly huge selection on craft beers, ciders (they carry ACE ciders which is quickly becoming a favorite of mine) and liquor.   I also really enjoy that they have tons of flavors for fries. First time I tried the Truffle and Sea Salt fries because I have a slight obsession with Truffle fries. They didn't necessarily disappoint but there was just waywayway too much salt for my liking. The other night I had the Parmesan Garlic fries and they were instantly my new favorite! Ugh!   Overall, I think it is really difficult to find something that you won't enjoying here.   ProTip: Use the NoWait app (you can use it via Yelp app too!) to avoid the long weekend wait!",

Our server Paige took our drink orders and was helpful with the ginormous beer selection. I got the raspberry beer and love, love love. I have got to find this beer in the grocery store!!! I ordered the classic burger and fries. Glad to see a place have a menu that doesn't take a month to read. Hopefully I will be able to go back with the hubby. Great beers and burgers, lived up to its name.",

They have fans blowing and the air blasting but it was still pretty warm. Must be the large windows, the wooden interior, or some other reason but that's here nor there. The overall feel of the place is casual, sports bar.    The beer menu was more extensive than the food menu but thats ok!  I tried the turkey burger on a gluten free bun.  It had goat cheese, fig, arugula and balsamic on it.  Husband created his own burger with cheese, lettuce and tomato.  What an exotic combo! Lol.  I ordered the black beans for my side and he ordered just standard fries (you can get them as jazzed up as you want).  Here is what I will say...The burgers were just ok.  Pretty flavorless actually.  The cheese and add-ons really made it edible. Husbands tomatoes were light pink so just not yet ripened. The pickles tasted like water.  My black beans were spicy and delicious.  The fries were bland and mostly burnt ends.  I enjoyed my turkey burger but it wasnt amazing.    Service was friendly and they have an outdoor patio where you can proudly observe thirsty beaver and their patrons as they hang on for dear life!  Im so rooting for them! Way to hold your ground! I digress...  Anyway...price point normal, food average, drink menu-thorough.  Location..clutch!  You can find one reason or the other to stop by so check it out.  They have fu man chu cupcakes as their neighbor so hit them up while you are there as well.  Get the irish car bomb cupcake to stick with the brew theme of your evening.  Another thought...does pint central next door hate them? Welcome them? Love them? Deep thoughts..",

    "text": "Here at Mood and Brew they've really perfected the art of the sandwich, as a result, this place is really starting to grow on me...here's my take on all the Mooin' and Brewin'.  I've been here a hand-full of times since they converted from the old Joe Hoopers which used to occupy this same building.  Since then it has been totally remodeled.  From what I understand, Moo and Brew is owned and operated by the same folks that own He's Not (w/ the Blue Cups) in Chapel Hill.  If you're a UNC alumni, you know exactly what/where I am talking about.    Each time I've been to Moo and Brew I always opt to build my own burger.  I am the kind of guy that likes options and likes to craft a tasty-piece of food-art whenever the opportunity avails itself to me.  With their build-your-own sandwich options, Moo and Brew provides me with a blank food canvas to create as I see fit.  I usually opt for the fried-chicken sandwich, on a Martin's potato bun.  From there, I go to town with all sorts of toppings from bacon, to pimento cheese, to onion straws to avocado - your imagination is your only limitation here.  No matter what or how you build your burger/sandwich it is sure to be served exactly as you ordered it.  Besides the taste, what's really impressive is how well the bun maintains its consistency with all the toppings and add-ons.  Finally, don't forget about the different side and fry options they offer.  Personally, I'm a fan of the parmesan, garlic and olive oil fries.          As I reflect, I really don't know why I don't come here more often.  The service is always great, and they have a great selection of beers.  I would def recommend Moo and Brew if you are looking for a great sandwich and a cold beer in the Plaza-Midwood area.",

    "text": "This review is solely for service, or the lack thereof.  My in-laws came in from out of town. They really wanted a burger. I told them there was a place down the road that I had heard served good burgers. So, my in-laws left my home on 5/14 around 10:30pm, in search of a burger. They went to M&B and were directed to the bar to place a take-out order.   They STOOD at the bar for about twenty minutes waiting to be acknowledged by the female bartender. They attempted several times to get her attention, to no avail. The bartender moved up and down the bar (which was not too busy) and never acknowledged their presence- no greeting, no \"I'll be right with you,\" NOTHING. After standing, yes, standing at the bar for twenty minutes, they realized they were not going to get served and left. They ended up going back to their room hungry and disappointed.   The next day when I asked about their experience, they relayed what I just wrote. I was bothered that they didn't ask for management. But my in-laws are nice old people, and didn't want the hassle. I probably wouldn't have sought out management either. After waiting twenty minutes in a food establishment that is supposed to serve all customers, I wouldn't want to complain about (the lack of) service, and then have them cook my food.   I have my suspicions as to why my in-laws were not served that night.  I will leave you with this: - Even when an employee is having a bad day, the customer should never suffer because of it, and - there are far too many restaurants in Charlotte that offer really good cuisine for an establishment to not be on their A game every, single day. I will always opt for the establishment with better customer service.  There are absolutely no excuses or reasons that can be offered to rectify this situation. Hopefully, this customer service issue can be solved with additional staff training, although I have a sneaky suspicion that training was not the issue here.",

When I could not decide on one of them they gave me a sample so I could decide. Kudos.  The food for the most part was good.  One in our party ordered french fries.  They were greasy and inedible.  I suspect the frier was not up to temperature since they had just opened.  The burgers were cooked to order.  I plan to go back and try some other items.",

    "text": "Another great day with good friends, good company & good beer.  My first time visiting a Moo & Brew after spending the last hour stuck in the Corn Maze with a desperate need of a cold beer. A friend recommended MB and so happy they did. With one apparently moving to my area (NODA), I'm actually pretty excited now.  I was surprised by the wait since in my mind it was going to bed just a bar and how wrong I was. MB has tons of beer selections and a great burger and fry selection. Having moved from the NJ/NY area Bare Burger was one of my favorite spots because of the protein selection. MB has Bison burgers! Let me repeat that, BISON! My burger was cooked medium which is the only way to eat a burger and the Angus burger (pilfered off a friend's plate) with the truffle oil fries! Complete heaven!   Ok on to the beers. With it being October, I mean why wouldn't you order a pumpkin beer. I enjoy Sam Adams Ocktoberfest but when in Rome. My waitress recommended the Cold Press which I mean I love coffee and I love pumpkin sounded like a match made in heaven but sadly not a favorite of mine. However the Last Leaf was spot on and very delicious so I highly recommend it.  Our waitress was pretty attentive so A for the service. And thank you MB for taking that Cold Press off my bill, I just could not drink that. Lookin forward to the NODA move. More Bison stories to come!  Check out the art in the bathroom! Love Love love it!  The only negative was I sat outside and there were dogs so I could see hair in the air and if it landed on that Bison it was surely eaten. The host desk is located so close to the door, there was a small line forming that I felt disrupted the staffs ability to deliver food/drinks. Overall great visit and will definitely be back again!  P.S. Can I get some other meat selections? Ostrich maybe, Gazelle. Just to name a few   P.S.S. Met this awesome couple/group who just adopted 2 little babies (twins )who sat next to us! So great chatting with them about their adoption experience and for letting us hold one of them. Ok that is all   Beers Last Leaf (Brown Ale w/ Maple Syrup) Cold Press Coffee Pumpking (Coffee Ale w/ Pumpkin)",

I have memories of drinking from my father's bottles as a little girl and had to have one. It tasted as I remembered!  Back to the review, I had the bison burger. It was good but I felt it was missing something. Next time I'll either add something to it, or pick a different burger. Overall, the food was great and the service equally so.  I'll definitely go back",

I kind of go back and forth between Kickstand and M&B, but after my lunch this past weekend, I think that the quality of beef is better.  The patty was big and juicy.  I usually BYOB - Angus patty, fried egg, applewood bacon, avocado, etc.   M&B has better offerings than kickstands, I am all about the Goodies and Sauces.   On another note and I really do not want to hate on Kickstand, but even M&B's buns are better, fresher and tastier.   If you go, please order the Cheese Curds, you will thank me later.      As I said Moo & Broo is about offerings, choices - nothing is better than an extensive craft draft beer list!   Supporting local breweries as well as some out of state beers.   Awesome!!!!!!!  One thing, if you have read this far...... Parking sucks, get there early, the place is small and fills up fast.   I always have eaten outside, it is nice and relaxing!",

Outdoor seating area is great, especially sitting right on central Avenue watching hondas fly over the railroad tracks and blowing out their suspension. After having all the burgers on the menu, I'd have to recommend the bison burger. It's simple, delicious, and gets the job done.

I went for their flagship Moo & Brew burger (medium rare since they grind in-house), fries, and a pint of Lagunitas IPA.  The burger was overcooked and bland.  No punch.  I added salt but couldn't rescue the flavor.  The fries were seasoned well and I think my wife would approve  (she's a french fry snob).   Shelby, my waitress, took great care of me.   Thanks, Shelby (who's not from Shelby)!  I dislike the aluminum serving trays.  The aluminum serving tray salesman must have retired by now and has a yacht at the Lake.  Has everyone bought from him?   Joe & Nosh, Mac's, now Moo & Brew and countless others.  I understand nobody wants to scrub dishes; but, where will our next great chefs come from?  Anthony Bourdain, Guy Fieri, and Bobby Flay all rose to stardom having began their careers washing dishes.  Old school.  Clink.  Clatter.  Breakage.  Serve my burger on something of substance or just wrap it in wax paper and stuff it in a brown paper bag, e. g. Brooks Sandwich Shop  Well, I kind went off.  Aluminum is my kryptonite, apparently.

    "text": "I built my own burger which ended up being Bison, lettuce, arugula, roasted peppers, pepper jack, pickles on a gluten free bun with an herb aioli. Also got the blue cheese fries. When arrived, the aioli made the burger slide around so much it could not be held . Burger was above average in taste, very juicy but not \"amazing\". The fries were not what I was expecting but was probably my fault for not taking the time to read the description properly. They were doused with buffalo hot sauce as had pieces of blue cheese on top. Kinda soggy and gross. My girlfriend had the rosemary fries which were pretty good especially if you like rosemary. It seemed to be fresh in flavor and smell. Overall a decent experience. Probably would not venture here again though.",

    "text": "A great American burger place with a nice outdoor seating. They have a variety of burgers and even BYOB menus with a number of tap beers. We decided to visit here and try out their burgers. Be warned their parking is limited but there is a paid parking opposite the restaurant where you can claim back the parking fee for bills over 20$.   The restaurant was pretty packed on a Friday evening and they would warn you upfront of the delays in service. But you can ignore that, their service is not that bad even during peak times. We never waited for more than we could.  Tried their Moo & Brew burger with a few beers on tap. Their beers were great. The burger was a let down and bland without any real kick to it. The side fries were better and we ended up relishing on the  fries rather than the burger.  Would recommend visiting this restaurant due to their great location and awesome outdoor seating. The burgers aren't the best tasting but do come here for their beers and sides!",

    "text": "I have to come back to this place. Next time with me dude, maybe my brother. Hell, maybe some friends.   It's a cute spot, cozy. So cozy, my mother and I had convos with a table next to us for a few minutes. Mainly about the service. They were there before us and were annoyed that their server hasn't come back in a long time. Right after we finished joking about the issue, the server comes to their table with two free drinks of what they were having and an apology. That was dope. Sometimes at restaurants you just get an apology. Shoo sometimes nothing.   Unfortunately they didn't like their drinks (mojitos). But mine was slammin!  The Midwood Mule was pretty tasty. While I didn't really taste the alcohol, the drink held its own with the fresh squeezed flavor of ginger. I'd order it again.   Now my burger was pretty good. Could have been a little juicier, as I ordered my meat medium. It wasn't bone dry but it was a little dry. Fortunately, the toppings made up for it. Although, I missed out  on the chili. Yeaaaaa I think they forgot it. But everyone else was good. They give you a ton of fries. That literally is a meal by itself. The flavor was definitely good. I liked the aioli, but I prefer ranch with my fries and they have really good ranch.   Our waiter was really helpful and attentive.   If the parking lot next to the building is full, the one across the street is $3 but they'll take it off your bill.   Enjoy!",

I have only had a couple of mishaps with Togo orders and any faults were fixed up and the service was amazing here EVERY TIME!!! The hand selected beer list includes several of my favorites which keeps me coming back for my favorites. I will keep frequenting this establishment as the service, quality of food/drink, service, and management is too notch comparatively to any other paces I have been to in Charlotte!",

I love that you can substitute your side and the protein on your burger as well as the bun. The service was outstanding. They accidentally left off an extra avocado on one of our burgers so they didn't charge us for it yet they still brought it out to add onto the burger. I love the beer flights; lots of options and you can mix and match any four! The size glasses within the flights seem bigger than most flights, too. I really recommend the Jive Turkey burger. I subbed angus for the turkey but I bet it would taste great even with the vegetarian option or as is (with Turkey)! Lastly, the owner was so friendly. On our way out, he introduced himself and asked for our sincere opinions. We'll definitely be back!",

I can't speak on the real burgers. The apps are unique and pretty good and the different fry combos are my favorite thing about this place. Great beer selection. And service is always on point.

The brews are in abundance too! They have great prices on PBR (gotta stay hip in Plaza Midwood) but they have so many other draft choices plus cans and bottles for days.

Now for the food: we ordered cheese curds for an app-they were good, but really greasy...tasted like funnel cake batter. I order the old trimer and added bacon. It was \"eh\". Nothing great. You can tell this is a premade burger slapped on a grill...lacks any flavor unless you drown it in ranch to get it down, bacon was extremely salty and my burger was undercooked to the point I could not eat it. My sweet potato fries were way over cooked and tasted burned. I could not even eat the meal. My Hubby got the farmer's daughter and it was undercooked as well. He said it was \"ok\". His fries tasted a heck of a lot better than my nasty, burnt sweet potato ones. All in all a bad experience. As I sit at the table writing this my stomach is already rolling and trying to revolt on me. I foresee a miserable night ahead.",

Was super rude. My 9 month pregnant friend, in the party of 5, and I walked all the way here based on the waitlist.

Neutral: Had the pimento cheese and hummus app. Pimento cheese was awesome but the hummus and cheese crackers were overwhelmingly salty. Cons: Rosemary truffle fries were overpowering with the taste of rosemary. Peter piper burger could have been much spicier. They need to put at least one beer on special every day.

Because everything was delicious and greasy and would have been the absolute best after a night of drinking. It was still an enjoyable experience even with a clear head.  There's literally one reason I drove all the way to Plaza Midwood for brunch - the Large Marge. My friends have taken pictures of meal Bloody Mary's and for years I have been jealous and coveted them. This weekend I finally had one and it was everything I hoped and dreamed (and the only beverage I have ever posted on Instagram).  The great thing about the Large Marge (other than being a delicious drink) is that almost every appetizer is featured on top. Trying one of everything is my favorite thing - ever. The cheese curds were a little disappointing (would have been so much better fried) but everything else was amazing. Fried picked green tomatoes - delicious. Jalapeno popper oozing cheese - obviously yummy. It looks like the slider was previously sold between grilled cheese buns and is no longer sold that way. Sadness but still delicious as a normal slider. Carrots and celery thrown in to ease my guilt. Oh and it was served with a miller highlife. I haven't had one in years but it felt fancier being served out of a small glass bottle.   My group also ordered an assortment of appetizers to share, and by far my favorite was the fried cheese curds. My fiance let me sample his turkey burger and it was delicious. I ordered a side salad since I basically had a full meal with my drink but wanted to balance it out a bit with something green. It was pretty large considering it was a side and the ranch tasted fresh.  If you've been thinking about the Bloody Mary go and get it. It even comes with a souvenir glass to take home. The samplings of food I had was worthy of a return visit.",

For starters, I like the Jalapeno Firecrackers (I mean come one, anything stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon) and the Midwest Cheese Curds. I love all the different fry options. Why Nacho Fries (loaded nachos but fries)- yes, hells yes. I get a different burger every time I come here pending on my mood. Big fan of the turkey and bison burger options. Don't see one you love? You can build your own. Bonus: you can also pick your bun (Martin's Potato, Wheat Bun, Gluten Free & The Skinny).   Moo & Brew is home to one of the most IG-worthy drinks in the city: The Large Marge. It's a meal in itself- 20 ounce Bloody Mary, topped with a Jalapeno Firecracker, Wisconsin cheese curds, two grilled cheese sandwiches, a burger, fried green tomatoes, bacon and a shot of Miller High Life on the side. If you're a UNC fan, this is also the only place here that you'll find the He's Not Here big blue cups.   This place is not huge inside, but it does have a nice patio.

If it hadn't been for our waiter looking out for us - this would've been a two star review.  We arrived and waited a solid 5 minutes before someone came to seat us. Hubby thought host may have been in the restroom but several people passed us and could've said someone would be with us soon. No one gave a crap that we were standing there waiting. I was on the verge of leaving when host showed up. We sat outside so we could watch the game. The bigger patio only has one TV so keep that in mind if you are there to watch sports. Inside and smaller patio has tons of TVs so great place to watch games. Hubby says that the beer selection was vast but heavy on the IPAs. He's not an IPA guy but found some other selections easily.  We ordered the Farmers Daughter and the Mushroom burger. I got a salad as a side and hubby got the buffalo blue cheese fries. My burger was cooked perfectly and salad was great! Bun was excellent (you have several basic choices for buns including GF) Large chunks of cucumber on the salad but I liked that. Hubby's fries were cold- seriously?? I love fries but they gotta be hot ya'll right?  He struggled thru them but I left them alone.   I decided to order the Rosemary Truffle fries for 'dessert'. Server came to tell us it would take a bit longer because the first batch they put up were cold and he sent them back. Thank goodness for my server!! Fries came out piping hot and let me tell you they set my world on fire!! Those Rosemary truffle fries with the magic sauce for dipping- BEST I'VE HAD ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD!!!   Our server was on the spot with extra drinks, sauces and lemon for my tea. Friendly without being stalky.  Seems this place could jump into the stratosphere if they just had better management keeping an eye on the front door and the fries. Such an easy thing to fix it almost makes me angry at the 'meh' attitude of management. Side note- there was a couple who brought their dogs seated on the patio so I would say you can bring your four legged friends.  Side note 2- the restaurant is located right beside a railroad crossing. If the train comes through, brace yourself. The train whistle is so loud it will rattle your teeth and almost blow your head off. I can't believe the dogs didn't freak out. We were there for an hour and a half and the train only came once so not something that happens consistently.",

    "text": "You get a good Moo and a good Brew here.  In all seriousness, the burgers are juicy and flavorful.  I usually get a Backyard Classic and add some mushrooms to it.  Sweet potato fries are always my go-to side; however, I have heard their regular fries are amazing.  When it comes to beer, they are always rotating their drafts and like to venture out on different beers.  I like going there for the variety of beer choices.  I can get a flight (they do 4 beers) with a sour, a wheat, a stout, and a porter if I wanted.  Love this place for a solid burger and a good beer selection!",

I think it goes down as my favorite specialty dish I've ever ordered. GET IT!!!! I'll start with how awesome it looks coming out, every person in the room let out a \"oooooooo!\" Once you take all the pictures and start actually figuring how to dissect it, you are so giddy like a school girl with al these little things to try!! Let me list: a slider burger.. plenty big, and thick! Cooked nicely medium..pressed between 2 grilled cheese breads, a bacon wrapped jalapeno popper, thick slice of applewood bacon, cheese curds, olives, carrot (like half a whole carrot!) celery, a few olives and as if there could be more, it comes with a side small bottle of miller high life! This is all atop a 20 ounce perfectly spiced and flavorful Bloody Mary. Did I mention you get to keep the cup????? I couldn't be more excited. It was a meal but the only thing to top it off more was the best sweet potato fries anywhere... thicker cut to really taste the sweet :) get the herbed aioli sauce and honey mustard and pull up a chair and stay a while! The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the burgers ordered at the rest of the table were ordered medium and medium rare, but were quite medium well... that just makes me sad, a great burger should be cooked properly. But, just get the Large Marge!!",

For the side I got the why nacho fries which basically has every topping you could possibly think of for nachos but on their famous fries. I highly recommend this place!

Even with all the jalapenos on top it wasn't very spicy and just didn't do it for me. The fries were just ok as well. I had expected more because this is a burger place but was disappointed. I doubt I will come here again.",

There was an air of calmness about him that was rather relaxing.   My friend and I went on a late Monday afternoon. It wasn't busy at all. Parking will either be on the street or the baby sized parking lot on the right side of the building. They have an outdoor seating area, but we opted to sit inside because the way heat and humidity has been lately- nah.   I chose to build my own burger. I got a turkey burger, but doubled the patty, wheat bun, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, and an over medium egg with a side of rosemary, truffle and sea salt fries. They do not skimp on the fries. I'm rather greedy and I couldn't finish the basket! The aioli sauce is good with the fries. I had that & ketchup with my fries.    The turkey burger was daggone near perfect. The patties were thick and seasoned well. The bread wasn't too dense and dry. I had the M&B special sauce to dip my burger in, which was really good. Totally recommend this place.",

Cheese curds, greasy and cheesy like you'd expect. On the undercooked side and all balled together into one big doughy cheese lump, not so much.   The burger was dense, and came out well done when I had asked for med rate. The patty was super thick in the middle and thin on the ends and grey all the way through.   Id rate it next to a 5 guys or in-and-out for my west coasters.   Definitely not for me.",

I have ordered the farmer's daughter burger twice and it was wonderful both times. My husband got the Peter piper and he enjoyed it.  Unfortunately I have to remove a star for a misunderstanding. We ordered and told our waitress what fries we wanted, not understanding that only the special fry flavors are extra and come in a big basket. She did not make sure to tell us that the burgers only come with their regular fries and the others are additional. It was definitely our fault for not reading the menu more clearly but I feel that she should've mentioned it to us. We paid a hefty price for fries we couldn't even eat half of. With that said, the rosemary truffle and sea salt fries are bomb!  Will be back!",

    "text": "Last night we came in with another couple after the YEE Bubbles & Badges party. My husband and I decided to share a BYOB (build your own burger) and a basket of the truffle fries with rosemary and sea salt. The burger was delicious but I wish that it  had been cut it in half for us because they knew we planned to share. It's very difficult to cut these burgers in half without losing half of the toppings. The fries were well seasoned, however, they were saturated in oil. So much so that the cardboard basket they came in was soaked as was the table below. I have never seen that before. The portion of the fries was also smaller than previous orders and smaller than the couple's that we were with which was odd.   We have been here more than 6 times in the last year and I find than I am getting a bit disappointed with the inconsistencies of the fry game. I've also ordered coke slaw on my burger several times and only received it once which is aggravating.   Earlier review: This was my 3rd visit here and I really enjoy Moo & Brew burgers. This time, we brought friends and they said this was the best burger they ever had, and they LOVE burgers.   The price is pretty good for what you get but I don't think I will order the \"skinny bun\" again. Also, I found it a bit ridiculous that I had to \"build my own burger\" to get the \"Fresh Produce\" burger for cheaper. I asked to sub-in a 100% angus beef patty for the black bean patty, having already done the math that it's the same price to build my own. The waitress informed me it would be a $3 up-charge. I don't remember this from last time, but it's been a while. The \"fry game\" basket of fries was good. I ordered the Parmesan option, but I was disappointed at the amount of Parmesan that didn't make it past the top layer since they say they are hand tossed in a bowl. They were tasty but I asked for salt and pepper which wasn't delivered to our table and I would've liked it for the fries missing Parmesan.   Something else that was frustrating with the dining experience is that when we arrived there wasn't a waitlist on Yelp (we had been monitoring). The host was getting a table inside ready for us and a server (or another host?) came up and sat a couple there! We ended up sitting outside and the guy who made the mistake said \"if it starts drizzling come inside immediately so you can get a table inside\" so when it proceeded to drizzle, I went inside and was informed that table was being saved for another party. I found this ironic since our table was given away.  Due to the mix-ups through it the evening, I am removing a star from the review. Moo & Brew wasn't that busy to be mixing up like this and I was really annoyed to have our table given away and then be sitting outside while it drizzled on us.",

I cant do it as much justice as a picture or the YouTube of it being made.  Let's just say you can call it a full brunch in/on a glass.      And you get to get the glass.  Fried Green Tomatoes were some of the best anywhere. The slider on my drink was delicious. After the first bite i said I will be back to get a burger.  Fast and very friendly but not overly so.  Place is smaller then I had thought so there will be waiting at times I'm sure. But everyone is always moving and getting it done.    I left off a star because I have had a better Mary. Just never such a cool one.",

Made with gooey white cheddar cheese, they were good, but I don't think we'll repeat them, as the portion size was too big for just two people.    My husband had their namesake, the Moo & Brew burger, served with onions, beer cheese, chili, and mustard.  The chili was spicy, the cheese was gooey, and the burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  I had a make-your-own burger, with grass-fed beef ($3 extra), cheddar, avocado, and buttermilk ranch.  My burger was also perfectly cooked to a medium, and was very juicy.    My husband's burger came with a side (mine didn't), and we shared his generous portion of hand-cut fries.  They were cooked well and nicely seasoned, and we both enjoyed them.  We also enjoyed our burgers, and here's why we liked them better than Bad Daddy's - Moo & Brew actually cooks the burgers exactly as requested (Bad Daddy's can't seem to get this right), and the buns sufficiently held up to the toppings (another failing of Bad Daddy's).    We'll definitely be back!",

The place can get packed and the noise a bit loud but it's absolutely worth the wait.",

I didn't wait at all to be seated because I made reservations on the Yelp app. I had the Backyard Classic burger with Sweet Potato fries. The burger itself did not have much flavor and I could make a better burger at home. The bun looked like something straight off the shelves of the local grocery store. The Sweet Potato fries were not good at all and I love Sweet Potato fries. The fries were tasteless. My boyfriend had the regular fries and they were much better. Customer service was good and they had a lively crowd. After eating at some other great hamburger joints in the QC this spot just fail flat.",

Definitely a fan of spicy burgers and the Peter Piper was amazing  server Diamond was friendly, knowledgeable and super helpful for picking things out, rosemary fries were awesome as well, such a cool different taste in fries. Sweet potato fries served with honey mustard is also a great combo. Overall ingredients were fresh and delicious.   Awesome beer selection, a ton of local stuff which great.   Decor is really cool too, would say old school meets new school for a burger/diner type place.",

We got the text that said our table was ready so we headed over and sat down immediately. I browsed the menu and decided I couldn't pass up the bison burger. Glad I chose it! It was flavorful and delicious! I also ordered the parmasean garlic olive oil fries, they were delicious. I couldn't even finish them because there were a lot! The service was great! Our server made sure we had everything we needed at all times. The only, and i mean the ONLY thing I didnt like, was the small water cups. I felt like I was taking shots of water. LOL!

She thinks it was the sauce they put on it, she couldn't get past the smell. It had a mold/mildew type smell to it. She tried scraping it off but in the end she just couldn't eat it.   The fries are ok, but again nothing spectacular, some were soft and some were hard like they were under cooked.   This place isn't bad, I did like mine but it's nothing special.

Unfortunately like most, the black bean burger didn't hold up very well and was messy to eat, but at least it tasted good. I want to try the salmon burger in the future. As for sides, my first time there we all upgraded our \"fry game\" and I ordered the rosemary truffle and sea-salt. I found it a little too salty and oily for my taste. The next time I ordered regular fries and they were just fine. The atmosphere is good as well.

    "text": "Moo and Brew is awesome! My roommate and I frequent Moo & Brew a few times a month. At first I was a little put off because I'm not really a fan of any of their premade burger options and I couldn't figure out the best way to order their fries. I've recently started doing the BYOB (Build Your Own Burger) option making the exact burger I'm feeling during that visit. In addition, I ask for cheese on the fries and I am never disappointed.  The wait staff at Moo and Brew is super knowledgeable about their large beer selection, which makes choosing your pint or flight so much easier. The flights at Moo and Brew are very cost-effective and gives you a great opportunity to try new beers if you're unsure of what you want.  Love the Plaza Midwood location and looking forward to the new Noda location they recently announced.",

I've been here a bunch of times and had a slew of things. I appreciate the fact that they let me get my burger as rare as I'd like without judgement... yes, I'm willing to risk it, and no, I don't care. Neither do they. Service is always great, ask for Jesse or grab Kaitlyn at the bar. Peter Piper burger is a good go to and it's not nearly as spicy as it sounds.   Their beer list is also awesome. It's always updated with a crapton of good local stuff and a few harder to find items. They also have prosecco on draft and a badass patio if you're feeling brunch-y.",

It was an appstate game so a little off the radar but they found it and put it on for me!  While we were waiting on our table we got a beer at the bar, what an incredible beer selection they have!  Masterfully curated with local and regional selections, many of which I have not seen in other places.  Someone on staff knows their beer and secures the very best for this spot.  We were lucky enough to meet the owner Matt on this night and he could not have been nicer.  He gave up his seat for us, shared his fried pickled green tomatoes and bought us a shot as well!  On to the food.  I ordered a build your own chicken sandwich with white American, bacon, pickled red onions and herbed mayo.  It was just incredible.  The chicken was crispy and cooked perfectly.  The bacon was crispy too!  I loved the potato bun and the pickled onions just made it a masterpiece.  I may go back tommorow just to order this sandwich again.  The fries that came along with it were nice and crispy, well seasoned and just perfect.  Service was impeccable and the food was outstanding, what more can I say!",

The burger was not a memorable one, and while the fries were also good...I would not crave those specific fries again. The craving part is important! I got the burger with jalapenos on it, and while the toppings were good, and the meat definitely cooked medium like I requested...the actual meat was bland. So saddd. The service was fantastic, and they have Abita root beer...which for a pregnant person such as myself was a huge bonus. I am so sick of water! I would go back because it is a cool atmosphere, but I do think there are several other burger places around that had better tasting patties.",

Mama bear behind the Bar was awesome too, she picked two great beers for me and my wife.   BUT the younger two female bartenders on Friday Feb 10th were trash. They only responded to the guys making disgusting remarks to them at the end of the bar. I would have liked to have been asked if I would like a menu and a starter item. First time we have ever been to Moo and Brew, they could have sold us more on the food options for the limited menu.  My recommendation is to never sit at the bar unless the noticeably older lady is working. Not that she looks old but she's a stinking good bartender. And has a lifetime of knowledge, both in good beers and in good service. That gets you much further than some bimbo in booty shorts who doesn't know the menu. I don't like to say never but I would be hard pressed to return. I wish I would have just got a table, and had a great ending to a great start. But the crappy bartenders destroyed any possibility of that. Hope Zack and his team continue to do well, and that these two bartenders dont hold them back from success. Good luck buddy!",

I wasn't looking for some flat patty frozen burger from some cheap chain restaurant but an authentic burger. Where else better to go than Moo&Brew.   I'm coming into Moo&Brew with a hefty appetite ready to devour some apps., drinks and burgers. A slight wait but definitely worth it. We had two orders of cheese curds that were absolutely phenomenal, the cheese melted in your mouth making you want more. The spicy pork grinds tasted like that were right off a pig frolicking in a patch of habaneros. The sweet tea flowed like water. Now for the Peter Piper burger with some nacho fries. The mouth watering burger with a little less kick than Bruce Lee was great for someone who likes heat but not too much. The nacho fries were alright but tasted more like chili cheese fries with a dash of Hispanic flare on top.  I highly recommend checking out Moo&Brew!",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us back to one of our favorite neighborhoods in Charlotte, Plaza Midwood, and to Moo and Brew. This burger spot offers \"Tried and True\" burgers, salads, and a variety of different types of fries.  For our appetizer, we selected the Midwest Cheese Curds, beer battered and served with a tomato infused ranch dip. These curds were great, crispy on the outside, hot and gooey cheese on the inside. The only negative was the grease left in the bottom of the tray. Dora here. Grease? What grease? lol. I wish they'd have come out before our meal. Then we could've enjoyed them more before filling up on our burgers.  I chose the Moo & Brew Burger, braised onions, chili, cheese, and mustard served on a potato bun and upgraded the side to Parmesan, Garlic & Olive Oil fries. This thick and juicy burger was outstanding, with hints of a smoky flavor in the chili. However, what stood out about this meal were those fries. A giant size portion and crisp, with just the right amount of oil so that the parmesan stuck to each fry.  I think I could have made my whole meal out of these fries. Worth the upgrade over the typical fries.  Dora here. You know how sometimes you're just craving a juicy burger? Today was one of those days. We both just wanted a burger, and we'd been eyeing Moo and Brew for a few months now. I like that they offer a \"Build Your Own Burger\" option. They loaded mine with beef, lettuce, relish, bacon, bleu cheese crumbles and aoili. Messy but YUM! Soft bun, fresh ingredients, just YUM. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I finally had the opportunity to check out Moo &a Brew and let me start by saying the whole night we were continuously wowed. That's all we kept saying to each other was wow this is amazing! My go to appetizer at most places is fried green tomatoes and since there isn't much you can change there (except the dipping sauce) most places are good but none really stand out until I had the pickled fried green tomatoes at Moo &a Brew. They are stand out for sure, I even saved a few and put them on my burger! We also had the cheese curds which were paired with a really great dipping sauce.   My boyfriend got the Peter piper burger but upgraded to the bison which he loved. The burgers are pretty big and I think he ate the entire thing in about 5 minutes, after both appetizers! He also upgraded his fries to the loaded nacho fries and he loved them.   I ordered the fresh produce burger with a side salad. The burger was really flavorful which seems to be a challenge for most people with black bean burgers but they definitely packed it with a great taste.   Aside from the food the service was great. I believe our servers name was Christina (that may not be right I'm not great with remembering names). She was very polite and took great care of us.   Of course I have blabbered on about the moo but the brew is just as great. They plenty of locals and a few not so locals as well. They also have a Winter Mule on tap made by one of the owners and the best way I can describe the flavor is Christmas in a glass. It was absolutely delicious and I would come here just for a mule if that's all they served.   All in all this place has it going on from the food and drinks to the atmosphere and sheer cleverness of the brand. I'll be back for sure!",

First experience here was awesome, and I didn't even have beef (although everybody at the table said that their burgers were excellent). We started off putting our name in, and we were told there would be a wait, but feel free to grab a drink. They have a specialized patio for pre-dinner drinks, where there's a sliding glass door from the inside for the bartender to hand you your drink -- excellent :)   We were sat in the amount of time promised, and given the menus.I decided to try out the Rocket Turkey which was excellent. Their goat cheese wasn't too tangy, fig was awesome.. and the turkey was like melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I decided to up my fry game (hell, everyone at the table decided to up their fry game) and go with the buffalo fries. These are SOAKED in buffalo sauce, which was great for me, but I can assume it would be a turn-off for others. The lady ordered hers with Rosemary and Truffle, which were also delicious and came with an aioii that I want to put on everything in my life.  I need to come back here for a beef burger, but the point is, I'm excited about coming back. This was a great spot to check out, until next time!",

The sweet potato fries  have a very \"homemade\" taste which is fantastic .  I have to say I prefer the sweet potatoes fries over the regular as they are a tad greasy .

I think the place is improving but still has a ways to go! I did enjoy my experience but hope for improvements as they work out the kinks!   Cons: Large Marge took over 18 minutes to get, which I understand it has cooked items but they should figure out a better system since I watched the bartender stain a drink that had been sitting there for ten minutes. Our drink was very watered down so the garnished were really what you were paying for! Suggestion is to out the fried green tomato and bacon one the burger! My burger was also overlooked! I still highly enjoyed my burger but I ordered MR so I expect some red which it was barely pink!   Suggestions: provide shading for patio! I wanted badly to sit outside but with medal chairs and no awnings it was basically impossible!!! Also I suggest working on a system of service for the Large Marge since it is such a point of interest!!!",

There was a wait but Moo & Brew is on the No Wait app which is very convenient- you can get on the list without having to be at the restaurant!  We got there a little before it was time to sit down so we sat at the bar and had drinks. The bartenders were very nice and knowledgeable about the menu.   I got the Large Marge which is a Bloody Mary with a cheeseburger slider in between two grilled cheese buns (whaaat?!), a stuffed pepper, cheese curds, bacon, and a ton of other fun stuff! It was $18 but is basically a meal and drink in one. I was amazed at how good the little slider was!   I ordered the BBQ chicken salad as my entree and could barely eat it because the large marge was so filling- but what I was able to eat was very good- the fried cheese curds were a nice touch!   Overall this place was fun and the food was tasty. I will definitely be back.",

Moo & Brew not only ranks up at the top of burger options in Charlotte for their food, but the people watching and patio make for a great experience.   While I was sad they had run out of the tall skewers for the items included with the iconic photo-worthy Large Marge Bloody Mary, it still hit the spot on a nice Sunday afternoon at 2pm. Their Fresh Produce burger was a good lighter option and the rosemary, truffle, and sea salt fries were savored while sipping on a sour beer.   It was especially nice to walk in right when a small table opened up outside that was both in the shade and against the wall, which allowed for a great environment for our toddler to not have to sit still during the meal and not get into trouble. Our server kindly brought a smaller water cup with a lid and straw, so great job on service.   There are obviously plenty of other places to grab a burger in town and even in Plaza Midwood, but if you want a relaxing environment with a solid portfolio of craft beer taps, Moo & Brew has it dialed in.",

If you are going on a weekend night, I suggest getting a reservation or going early and having a drink or two at the bar. They have many different types of beer (none of their own-brewed in house). For a starter, you must get JALAPENO FIRECRACKERS, which are Pimento Cheese Bacon Blanket With Buttermilk Ranch. For a main course, you can get Burgers and Salads. If you aren't a fan of the specialties you can create your own. Tons of options to put on your BUILD YOUR OWN BURGER. They also have chicken, Vegan Black Bean Patty, and other options for those who don't want beef on their burger. Great place for a casual night with friends!",

I've always heard of this place because of them specializing in burgers and beer, now granted I'm pescatarian so this is no burger review per say but as a whole the place was just okay. The restaurant is soooo tight not much space to move around and typically a wait because not that much seating, which led us to sit at the bar. I ordered the salmon burger with sweet potato fries the burger could've been sooooo much better without this dill pickle mixture they added to it. I can honestly say it ruined the whole sandwich. My favorite piece of the dish was the sweet potato fries and I was kind of jealous of my friends truffle fries as well. I did sample a few beers and the bartender recommended more for us to try and I will say I was definitely satisfied which says a lot because I typically stay away from beer and just choose a cocktail instead (but you can't go to a beer place and not try the beer lol). Overall, the service was good they were nice but nothing fantastic and the food was mediocre; I would only return if maybe in the area and couldn't find anything else",

I'm glad I got over myself and gave 'em a try, though, because they've quickly become one of my favorite burger joints in Charlotte.   I've sat on the patio and inside and I've felt comfortable either way. The service is quick, charming, and helpful.   I would be doing Yelpers a disservice if I didn't share this: get the chicharrones. Get a double order. I'm so serious. They're absolutely perfect, and the flavor is exceptional. The honey lime drizzle is a revelation.   I've been pleased with every burger I've ordered at Moo & Brew. I'm especially glad they have a gluten free bun on the menu.   The fry sides are also delightful. The Bleu Buffalo fries can end up a bit soggy, but the Rosemary Truffle Sea Salt, the Parmesan Garlic Olive Oil, and the Loaded Nacho fries are all excellent. I've also had the black beans as a side. The flavor is good, but they're too spicy for me. Stick with the fries.   Parking can be a pain, but I think that's come to be the way of life in Plaza Midwood.   The clientele seems to skew toward the bro crowd, especially during the brunch hours. Be prepared.   I'm excited to hear about the upcoming NoDa location; I hope they can capture the spirit of the original and find success on that part of town.   In summary: Chicharrones. GF buns. Truffle Fries. Go.",

    "text": "We decided to finally check out Moo & Brew before out kickball game on Monday. Such an awesome decision.  Moo & Brew has a nice outdoor patio with some seating indoors as well. Parking is a bit difficult but we managed to snag a spot of the street.  I ordered a Wicked Weed IPA.....cant remember what my husband got. The beer list was pretty extensive and there were a good many that I don't usually see on the beer list. They did NC proud with their selections! I also noticed they have a flight for $8 that includes four pours.  We decided to split the Farmers Daughter burger with the rosemary truffle fries. The burger was perfectly cooked and I loved the combination of egg, bacon, cheeses, and that sauce! The fries were fantastic! Nice sized portion and the aioli served with it was a nice accompaniment. So glad we decided to split as we were so full after!  Excellent burger spot and addition to Plaza Midwood!",

It is a good bar with plenty of local beers and I would give that part good reviews although it is kind of small inside.  I can tell by the burger and fries I had that the food is not bad but also is typical bar food.  Nothing special here, plain and simple. Probably will be back for drinks and that's it.",

    "text": "Great patio overlooking Central Avenue! They have a lengthy beer list including many local drafts. You can either build your own burger or order one of their creations. They also have options like salmon, veggie burgers and salads. The fry options are really creative too, nacho, buffalo, rosemary truffle, etc. I can't not get the peter piper burger. I love all things spicy and this burger is topped with bacon wrapped jalapenos for crying out loud! The pretzels with beer cheese are great, and so are all of the fry varieties I have tried. I will say, things can really add up on the burgers if you're adding things and upgrading fries and before you know it you've got a $17 burger and fries.   Moo & Brew is also the Charlotte UNC Bar. Finally got to make it there on a game day to watch the National Championship game and was very impressed with how well they executed a busy night. Our server was awesome, constantly checking on us and food and drinks came out quick. They set up the seating to maximize viewing and make it comfortable for everyone! Definitely reccommend for watching a Carolina game, or just when you want a good burger!",

We got the Nacho Fries with the chili on the side which was s a great choice for a larger appetizer that can be shared! Their beer list is pretty expansive with a great selection! I even have to give a shout out to their greeter for having the most awesome sleeve tattoo - he has all the characters from the movie \"The Labyrinth\"!",

The burgers were great but the French fries were poor. The quality of the fries was poor because I think they are just frozen and fried with seasoning on them. The beer selection is really good.",
