I am a big BBQ fan so it takes a lot to impress me with BBQ.  The green beans and hush puppies were really good!  Seasoned just right and hot!  The mac and cheese was good, not great.  Also, the BBQ was good but not great.  It was lukewarm and I like BBQ to be warm to hot.  The sauces were really good with my favorite being the \"swine wine\" and the mustard sauce!  Now, the service.  The service here was pretty dang awesome!  Loren greeted us at the register and took our orders.  She was pretty amazing!  Her display of customer service was top notch and we were really impressed!  It is always great to see someone in hospitality love their job and enjoy doing it!  She is a True asset to this company!",

The lunch portion of sandwiches are good (quartet lb for lunch sandwiches and half lb for regular size)The price is on point for the rest of this area lunch wise. Lemonade is good too recommend that. Didn't try the tea since I'm a sweet tea snob. The customer service is really good. They seem to explain everything really well. The place is clean and a tv is visible from every seat. I hope they add wings to their menu though...no bbq place in NC should have anything less than vinegar base sauce, pulled pork and smoked wings! If you saw my picture you'll see I had banana pudding as one of my two lunch sides (yes it's allowed) and I will say they gave an honest effort. Don't expect soul food grandmama style banana pudding but I'd give it 3.5 out of 5",

So when you arrive, you walk in and order your food then you take your seat. When they're busy you may have to send out a \"seat scout\" while you wait for your meal. We had the big Judges sampler with mac & cheese and hush puppies as the sides. Skip the mac & cheese. Everything else was spot on. Ribs tender and tasty. Chicken smoky and flavorful. Brisket and pulled pork very good. Beware however... the full cut brisket looks a lot like the pulled pork so don't think that they forgot to give you your brisket like I did! All in all a great BBQ place and a very good experience!",

    "text": "I give it 3.5 stars - really nice order and sit down place. Clean and the staff is very friendly. The kitchen is open so you can see the staff pull your meat fresh. Very good meat, I had the choose two and got pork and brisket. The brisket was the better of the two, great flavor and has a distinct smoke ring and the bark seasoning is great. Collard greens are good, a little on the salty side but has big pieces of pork in it for good flavor. I wouldn't order the beans again, but maybe just what I prefer. I'm not a fan of sweet bbq beans and I actually think they cook them in their sweet bbq sauce. There is brisket in the beans and it gets pretty tough from long term cooking.   There are 3 reasons that keep me from giving 4 or 5 stars. First, my pork was over half of fat and my brisket was about 1/4 of fat. When I finished, the leftover fat put together could have been a pretty decent sandwich if it were meat. Second, which is not a huge deal, but they have about 6 bbq sauces and don't explain what they are. So I just went out on a limb and chose the Original and Brushfire. The Original was thick and sweet which went better on the brisket and Brushfire was better on the pork which was a little spicy, thinner and had vinegar. I would have tried the others but since they looked similar I didn't know if I should have taken the \"risk\". Lastly, their sides aren't included with the entrees so everything is basically a la carte. I could understand ordering just a sandwich and paying more for sides but for a $14-22 entree, I believe sides should be included, not $3.29. My opinion though.  Overall, I would go back and I'm not too upset about having so much fat as it may vary based on who is making plates that day. If a manager is reading this, I would recommend having the person doing the plates trim the fat a little. If I had to compare it to something I'd say the atmosphere of Shane's Rib Shack with the food quality of a family BBQ place.",

Sides:  The fries are amazing and you MUST top them with the cheese and bacon, the hush puppies are ok, the baked beans were sweet and savory (I'm guessing molasses), and the okra were crisp and seasoned perfectly.  They have yummy lemonade, and my fiancee was excited that they had 3 diet sodas (unheard of) to choose from -- pepsi, mountain dew, and Dr pepper.  The cashier was sweet enough to give us free chocolate cake to go.  We were so stuffed from huge portions, that we had room for dessert.  We will definitely be back!!!!",

Last time I was there, I got the brisket which was dry like it had been sitting for awhile and the sides came out cold. Utensil and sauce area was dirty and they were out of the usual cups you put the sauce in. No one was bothering to call people's names when the food was ready either so that seemed confusing to a lot of people who were sitting down waiting for the food only to find out they had to go up and get it. Poor communication and service. What was once a place I thought was decent for BBQ has become a place that I will avoid in the future. For the price and all the self service that you do for yourself, I feel I'm better off going to a full service BBQ place as well.",

I was also pleased to know that some non-pork/beef options are available during Lent, such as smoked salmon.",

They will hollar out your name when it's ready which is annoying because its pretty loud in there. Bbq: tender and moist! Mac and cheese had NO flavor, spiral noodles with a creamy sauce and no seasoning or flavor. Fried okra, grainy corn meal coating with NO flavor. Meals do not come with hushpuppies or cornbread! Sauce bar was nice, but unkept and dirty with fruit flies flying around. My husband said the banana puddimg was great! DRIVE TO CONCORD FOR BBQ, WORTH THE DRIVE!",

I had the barbecue leg and thigh, green beans and hush puppies, and I enjoyed EVERYTHING. The chicken was moist inside and well seasoned. The green beans were unbelievable!.....bursting with flavour. And the hush puppies were hot and crispy. I particularly enjoyed the mustard based barbecue sauce too. I'd definitely go back.  Okay....we went back and enjoyed our food again, but found that the prices are too high to continue eating here. I consider $26.00+ for two people to be more than I want to spend for barbecue chicken, baked beans and string beans. (I didn't even get a drink with my meal. I just had water.) Especially since it's not a restaurant where you are served your food at your table. There are less expensive options out there. A man sitting at another table hollered over to us (it wasn't at all crowded), and asked us how much we paid for our food. He said he just paid $37.00 for food for himself and his friend! He said that's way too much money.  If they lower their prices, we might go back. If not, we probably won't.",

    "text": "UPDATE  I've gone back to City BBQ several times, drawn by the excellent service and even better food. Some great brisket and fantastic pulled pork served by smiling, friendly employees all make for a great afternoon and evening.   I only recently found out about City BBQ, a semi-recent import from Ohio of all places. I'll admit, I was a bit skeptical about the place. I mean, what does Ohio know about good barbeque? Apparently. . . quite a lot.   This is some fantastic food. I've had the brisket and pulled pork, sausage, chicken, cornbread, mac and cheese, chocolate cake and 'nanna pudding. No, not all at once. I don't care how good the food is, there are limits to what I can ingest in a single sitting. I've been there twice. And both times I thought I'd finally had that long-prophesied heart attack and ended up in BBQ Heaven.   Nope. Still alive and thank goodness. I get to go back to City BBQ again. Not only is the food tremendous, the staff there works overtime to make everyone in the place feel at home. I honestly marveled at how this restaurant seems to have stocked up on helpful, friendly, knowledgeable employees while I have been almost to the point of setting fire to myself in a bid to get the attention of my local grocery clerk.   This is a fantastic addition to the local BBQ scene. I want more. It's well worth your time and money. Get there",

As we walked in I was a little overwhelmed with my options but the friendly staff was kind enough to offer samples of whatever meat I wanted.   Being a brisket girl that was my first choice, and my last :)  After a pound of some delicious fatty brisket (yes, you can choose your cut) I was left very impressed. I wish I had gone for the \"city sampler\" so I could have judged their other cuts of meat but then again, it gives me an excellent reason to go back!",

I always root for the little mom and pop places that depend on referrals for their living and utilize recipes handed down from generations of bbq'ers but today I am here to sing the praises of.. I hesitate to say.. a chain restaurant. Twice now I have visited this chain in two different locations to assure that is not just a fluke and I am happy to report that I have not been disappointed! The creamy slaw is heavenly even though it is thick cut Carolina slaw, the bbq brisket beans are sweet as molasses and are choc full of brisket. The sausage is pleasant but not too spicy, the brisket is lean and tender and for the first time tonight I tried the pulled chicken and was very pleasantly surprised. The turkey is incredible and quite possibly the best you'll have this side of thanksgiving dinner. There are more sauces to mop up these sinuous delicacies than you can shake a proverbial stick at. The service was incredibly friendly and welcoming. I can't stress how important it is nowadays to walk into a joint and feel welcomed. The wait time for our food was nearly nonexistent which is a definite plus if you find yourself visiting for a short lunch break. If you find yourself in the vicinity, do yourself a solid and stop by. They definitely will not disappoint!",

The downside is that Google Maps hasn't really figured out how to properly give directions to this place.  Don't worry the Google will figure it out eventually.  This location has plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors.  The place is brand spanking new so everything is all clean and shiny.  I really think you should give this place a try and order a few things off the menu.  I am always a sucker for the brisket, but the chicken here is cooked right.  Not dry at all, which is a common problem when you get chicken.  Places like to play it safe and overcook the chicken, but City Barbeque has confidence in their cooking skills and cooks the chicken safely and savory.",

We started with smoked turkey and sausage. The turkey was smoked to perfection and super tender. It was definitely not that dry thanksgiving variety. The sausage was delicious, as well. It had a bit of a kick to it.   The next course was the  smoked half chicken. Out of all the barbecue joints I've been to City Barbeque really nails it. Not dry, ultra flavorful. You couldn't ask for a better bird.   Next we had the pulled pork and brisket. The pork was flavorful and juicy, while the brisket was so tender you could easily cut it with a spoon. They had several sauces but none were required.   Just when we thought we were done, they brought out the St Louis ribs. They pride themselves on not being the fall off the bone variety. It was said that this meant they were cooked too long.  It must be something to that because their ribs tasted as if they were from the heavens!  How could I forget the sides?! We tried the corn pudding, potato salad, green beans, and baked beans. The corn pudding almost tasted like a desert. My table loved it. I couldn't decide. I liked all of the sides. The potato salad tasted like what grandma used to make. The baked beans were some of the best I've ever had and the green beans were very flavorful. You'll love them, i guarantee.   The service was top notch. The staff was amazing. The tea was equally amazing. I will definitely be back. Great job!",

We brought a large (10 people) group in for lunch and it took quite awhile for them to complete our order.  I get the feeling they are still working out some kinks in their system.    The food was solid for the most part, portion sizes were decent for the price.  I would probably go back if I'm in the area and have a taste for BBQ but not sure I'd go out of my way to return.",

I couldn't bring myself to get the brisket because I didn't want to compare the two places. I did however try the smoked turkey and the sausage. Both were absolutely delicious! The turkey was really moist and flavorful, and the sausage was on point too.   I also tried the french fries which were fresh and delicious and had just the right amount of salt. I also had the green beans, which I loved. We got the fried pickles too, and those were also really good.  I loved that there were lots of sauces to try, and that they give you so much food. I had enough left over to have an awesome dinner. Great place for quick and delicious bbq!",

Literally everything is so delicious, with the exception of two things: the greens are too salty and the mac and cheese is too artificial. Other than that, I am obsessed with the pulled pork, brisket, ribs, and chicken. These people do meat justice! The sides are great and I especially love the corn pudding! The banana pudding is also to die for. They have generous portions and they will let you try anything before ordering which is always much appreciated. I will definitely be back here many times to come for the great location and staff!",

    "text": "This is by far one of my fav Barbeque's in all of Charlotte. Their sides are soooo good and I love their lunch deals. You can get a meat with two sides for around $9-10 depending if you get a drink or not.   The pulled pork is definitely made just right and you can get as much barbecue sauce as you want if you eat in. They have a plentiful amount of sauces you can try until you figure out which one is your favorite.   Personally, I like the original the most if I'm eating the pulled pork sandwich!   I think this is a good joint near the university area and is often under-looked because it is a chain restaurant. However, it's an awesome Barbeque place for a reasonable price with some banging potato salad, collard greens, and baked beans.. and corn bread... and green beans... and what the heck! All their sides are good!!!",

    "text": "My mother-in-law raves about her local City Barbeque in Indiana, so my partner and I decided to try the place out. I expected a sit-down experience with a server, but instead I walked up to a counter and placed my order. Not a bad thing, just not what I was expecting.   We both ordered off the lunch menu - a pulled chicken sandwich (smaller size for lunch) with two regular sides (we both chose green beans and Mac n cheese). What I did enjoy was that you chose your own BBQ from a selection and added as much as you wanted. I chose the sweet bbq, and I really enjoyed it. Personally, I only found the chicken OK. Same with the green beans (served with bacon and onions). I did enjoy the Mac n cheese, but I struggle having a side be my favorite part of the meal.   Upon telling my mother-in-law that we were finally at City Barbeque, she told us to get a banana pudding, which was also advertised in the restaurant via a framed picture of the banana pudding on the cover of a Paula Deen magazine, so we decided to try it out. Now, this was definitely my favorite part of the meal. We shared one banana pudding, but I'm telling you I could eat two by myself. It was absolutely delicious, and I loved the caramel sauce on it. The fourth star on this review is simply for that banana pudding.   I can't say that I will ever choose City Barbeque if it's my turn for dinner, but I won't object when someone else recommends it. Be sure to download their app before visiting - you get $5 off your first purchase. Great for your first visit, but it's only OK as far as reward programs go - you have to spend $100 to get your next $5 off. I'm hoping they do various promotions via the app though to lure people back in. I'll update if that's the case. Otherwise, the app isn't really worth it besides your first purchase (unless you go regularly or pay for a group).",

Service is all over, portion is all over....the only consistent thing is taste, which has been pretty good.  This is an order at the counter and sit kind of place- no servers.  They say your name, you pick it up and do the rest.  As others have said there's a huge condiment area with tons of BBQ sauces, pickles, onions, jalapenos and other things.  This is also where the silverware and to go boxes are.  This area has been messy on both visits.  I have tried  the pork, ribs, chicken and brisket.  All are good and have good flavor.  The consistency with portion is where the problem is regarding food.  The price is pretty consistent with local BBQ prices, but it's a bit less of an experience.  Until they get it down I'll have to say 3 out of 5.",

    "text": "Don't stop reading my review because of the low score because...I'm willing to give them another chance!   I think I caught them on an off day. And I'm sad to say I just wasn't impressed with my first visit. It didn't have anything to do with the service! They were kind and accommodating during the entire visit. I asked a lot of questions, asked for a sample and then had a small issue with my sides. But they were more than accommodating during my entire visit.    A little background, I anxiously awaited this visit. After seeing so many of my fellow yelpers friends LOVE it here... I knew that I wouldn't be disappointed. Seriously, I read a lot of reviews and there's a few folks that I know if they loved the food then I'm going to love it too. It's what happens when you hang with foodies who know good food!  That being said - perhaps my expectations were just too high.   I ended up ordering the pulled pork with gumbo and baked beans. The pulled pork was tasty! I really loved the fixings and sauce bar. They have jalapenos! And I sampled most of the sauces with my favorite being the \"Low Co\" (the orange-ish one). Very good!   My main issue was with the sides. First, I tried the gumbo wasn't exactly what I was expecting. But I let them know and the managers were so kind! They came over to the table asked questions and offered another item so I tried the fried okra. And they brought a fresh batch out and the spicy ranch was delish. But I wasn't a fan of the breading. Lastly I also tried the baked beans and they were just too thick and sweet for my liking. After the last one I just gave up and ate the meat.   But I'm going to give them another try! Mostly because I enjoyed the meat and there are other sides that I want to try. Like the collards (they were out this visit) and the corn pudding - I sampled my friend's and it was really good. I'd order that next time for sure. I also want to try the other meats, the smoked turkey, ribs and brisket all looked delicious in pictures.   So stay tuned! I'll be back.  ***Thanks again to the managers for coming by our table and listening to the feedback! I really appreciate that you care about your customer's overall experience!***",

The staff seemed a little busy or overwhelmed for some reason, although it wasn't really that busy.  I waited for awhile to get my order in.  I sampled the mac & cheese before deciding what sides to order and it is very creamy, not baked.  I decided against it and got the pulled pork sandwich, baked beans, gumbo, and corn pudding.  Now mind you, I have been to a YELP event at their first location & was pretty satisfied with most of the stuff.  They were out of collards, sad.  So let's give the run down: baked beans were not good.  It seemed like they sat in a thick, sweet paste all day and we got bottom of the barrel? I don't know, but not what I remember.  Gumbo: horrible...the rice was hard & sticky, there was no sausage in mine, and the flavor was disappointing.  Corn pudding: good, exactly how I remember it.  I tried my friend's okra: horrible!!!!! What the heck??? I don't understand what went wrong tonight. I enjoyed my corn pudding and my pulled pork sandwich with the sweeter sauce and an orange sauce (forget the name).  A few managers came out and took away our gumbo. They checked back on us and even brought us dessert to make up for some things.  They were both really nice and I was thankful they helped us out.  I just don't get what happened with the food, because I remember loving a lot of it at the Ballantyne location on YELP event night. The staff was unorganized and not paying attention or busy with something..I'm just not sure what.   Underwhelming experience and a little depressing.  Maybe an off night?!  Thank you to the managers for caring and being very courteous.  Good customer care.",

In theme with the changing times, this restaurant is low-key causal dining. Once they ring you up, grab a seat and they will call out your name.   The food is great for BBQ. Everything is made fresh the day of and you can tell. Me and the boo both got the brisket meal. I got mine with two sides: macaroni and cheese and collard greens. The collard greens are half a step below my mama's Thanksgiving collard greens. I am a collard green snob and haven't had some this good. It was the perfect amount of slight bitterness and seasoning. The macaroni and cheese was good for a restaurant but didn't knock my socks off. The brisket was so damn tender! Some of the best I've had in Charlotte. The only downside was that it was a little cold for my taste... but I guess I'm glad they didn't warm it up and cause it to dry out.   The food is delicious, the service is great, the bathrooms are clean, and their prices are on point. Definitely a great addition to the community.",

I am really not a fan of the bbq here, and the brisket is just ok,  The smoked turkey and pulled chicken are the clear winners here, flavorful tender smoked turkey, I'll have 2 orders of that please.  There was no need for me to sample anymore of the meat after trying the turkey and chicken, I was sold.  The sides were not very impressive, especially the greens that seemed very oily for some reason.  I wasn't a fan of the mac n cheese, but it was fine for my son's liking.  The corn pudding was amazing but very buttery, and the potato salad was surprisingly tasty.  For dessert I took a chance on the banana pudding, it was described to me to have a butterscotch drizzle and some type of cookie crumbs on top..........amazing, get it!",

Right off the bat you'll see a much wider variety of meat options on the menu than most BBQ places around. I was very intrigued by the smoked sausage. Not only will they give you a sample of any menu item, they encourage it with a big sign inviting you to simply ask! I decided on the Brisket and Sausage. Usually for sides I stick with Mac & Cheese and Cole Slaw at BBQ restaurants, but because of the long list I decided on Corn Pudding and Collards!  The meats, WOW! Smoked sausage that reminded me of authentic Texas BBQ. Moist, tender brisket with an amazing smoke profile. The collards were noteworthy, perfectly cooked and seasoned, with a good amount of pot broth. The corn pudding reminded me of a sweeter version of Corn Casserole. While the corn was good, next time I'm just getting 2 collards!  So we tried 5 of the numerous BBQ sauces and I'll mow through them real quick (all purely subjective mind you. Your mileage may vary!). City sweet was... Sweet, it was OK. Original was good, balanced flavor but not very bold. Burbon was a more dynamic sauce than original, nice savory note. Piedmont Pride, uh if you like vinegar so much you can take it in an IV drip then maybe this is for you, it's not for me. Spicy Ginger, oh boy this is a winner! Nice, mild spice with just the right sweetness. Reminds me of a ginger Sweet Chili sauce.  So there you go, I can't wait to try more! The cashier had a brief moment of impatience it seemed, but they were having technical difficulties that delayed the ordering process more than it should have. Things happen, I just hope the food is as excellent next time as it was last night!",

I appreciate the expanded selection of sides which include chili and stews plus they have seasonal sides. I enjoy variety.  The bbq is disappointing. I have tried the bbq on multiple occasions since they opened because I have wanted the food to be great but it is not. The bbq is OK and expensive for what they offer. They have huge smokers but the meats lack smoked flavor. Originally I thought well wait a few months until the new smokers are well seasoned and broken in BUT no it has not changed.  Don't get me wrong the meats are tender and juicy but they lack the slow smoked flavor they claim to have.",

    "text": "This location still has a lot of bumps to work out because consistency is not key here. I was thrilled to have this University location open due to the proximity to my house and because I enjoy City Barbeque's food and Matthews location.  However, after having been on multiple occasions, I can confidently share that the food is good but the food preparation/service is not great.  If this place is busy and you're ordering take-out, make sure you CHECK YOUR ORDER before you leave because, chances are, they will screw it up. Even though they read back your order, they will still leave out items.  Other than the accuracy issue, they still provide the same menu items found at other CB locations. Food is served pretty quickly and they will normally try to make up for any errors they have caused. On the weekends, I do wish that they had TWO people consistently on the registers. Most recently, I was there during the Saturday lunch rush and there was one cashier. The line was past the entrance and yet, the one cashier remained. Also, it would be helpful to have someone who periodically checks the tables and wipes up messes. Every time I've been there, the condiment & 'fixins' section (where the pickles, BBQ sauces are located) has always been sloppy. Doesn't really make you want to sample BBQ sauces when they're spilled everywhere.  I must share that the CB app is great and allows for you to rack up points so that you can, in turn, redeem them for \"rewards\" such as taking $5 off any order, free beverage, dessert, etc.",

I was attending a meeting and the food was ordered in for us so I only had a few of the things from their menu but that was very good.  The items that had been ordered were the Beef Brisket, Chicken, Macaroni and Cheese, Green Beans and Tea both sweet and unsweetened.  The flavor of the Brisket was AMAZING and it was falling off the bone tender, which is just the way I like it.  They had trimmed the fat and the slices were just the right thickness.  The smoky flavor permeated the meat and tempted my taste buds before I ever bit into it.  Later I tried the chicken and it was equally delicious but I only had a forkful so next time look for more input on it.  The macaroni was cheesy and the noodles were fully cooked and delicate.  The green beans were well seasoned and full of meat.    I cannot wait to visit their location to experience it in person but for now I will live on the memory of the delightful lunch I had.  I highly recommend this place if you are looking for really good comfort food.",

Let's start with the employees - they were all super nice. You know how in commercials, restaurant employees smile genuinely at the customer and laugh jovially? It was like that minus the commercial. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. I noticed that they brought the food out to a couple near us who was dining with a cranky infant, rather than calling their name to come to the counter and pick it up. I appreciate little things like that - kindness.   The food was amazing! I ordered the brisket sandwich combo with corn pudding and fries. It was so much food that I barely ate any of the fries. My fiance had the brisket, sausage, mac and cheese, and baked beans - he loved it all.  *If I had one area for improvement, it would be for there to be some fish/shrimp options. As a person who doesn't eat a lot of meat, I won't be able to come here as often as I want because of the limited options without meat. That being said - when I do come, I know it will be wonderful.  Great food! Great experience! We will be back.",

Actually the official opening date for this one is tomorrow June 19 and a fourth will be opening in Huntersville later this year.  Founded a little over 20 years ago in Columbus Ohio, these guys have made a science of all styles of BBQ. Rather than just one style of BBQ, they have studied all and have have pretty much mastered all of them from Eastern NC style called a Lolo to the tomato based Lexington style to Mustard Based SC Style to Memphis to Texas Brisket to St. Louis Ribs.  They showcased all of these and more and we got a chance to try smoked turkey, smoked Texas Sausage, BBQ Chicken, Pulled Pork, Texas Brisket and a full rack of St. Louis Ribs along with a number of sides including BBQ Beans, Potato Salad,Corn Pudding, Hush Puppies and for desert, Banana Pudding.  Out of all of this, the only thing I did not like was the Hush Puppies which were a bit greasy on the inside.  That said, forget the hush puppies because there are so many other things to dine upon and not fill us the the Hush Puppies.  Very open and friendly staff and between on of the original founders, the store manager and dining room manager, they made us feel right at home. We had a chance to see the smokers both inside and out, the kitchen prep area and had several demonstrations on the proper way to serve the meat.  This is going to be a good place for BBQ. If you bring in a private sauce often found in BBQ restaurants, you get a free t-shirt. They also are working with the community schools and non-profits on fund raising project.",

I had the pulled pork with Mac and cheese and hush puppies.   My wife had the Brisket with the collards and corn pudding.   Good portions and good flavor.  We also tried the peach cobbler.   The cobbler was very sweet and a little bit of a let down.    Overall I would repeat if I was in the area.",

Pulled Pork, Turkey, Pulled Chicken,  sausage,  Brisket,  Texas Toast,  Cornbread,  Mac&Cheese,  Baked beans w/chucks of brisket,  hush puppies, and peach cobbler for dessert.   We rolled out of there, but O-Lordy it was FANTASTIC!  Loren (Manager?) Was absolutely amazing.  Absolutely cares deeply about the food but more importantly the customers.   We are visiting from Kalifornia and would definitely love to have the owners open a restaurant by us.",

The lady working the counter was super helpful and got me a $5 credit for installing their app and registering. Bonus.  I chose the \"Judge's sample\" which included a half rack of ribs, pulled pork, quarter chicken, beef brisket and I chose one creamy and one spicy cole slaw as sides. Nicely packed, it was still warm when it got home.  A great variety (that's the idea, Bruce) and we enjoyed the pork, brisket and chicken. The ribs, not as much. I'm sure that we just got a bad one this time. Very dry and overdone. It was the only thing off from the whole batch.  Will return to CB soon enough and will get the ribs because I'm sure this was just a random.  [Review 11641 overall, 1422 of 2019.]",

I often get better counter service at fast food places.    We got our drinks and then had to try to find a table that had been wiped down.  Finally found one that wasn't too bad and put our drinks on it, only to find food all over the floor that had not been cleaned up. Never saw anyone working the dining area while we were there.        All this was at 7:30pm on a Sunday.     The food was ok, but i will say my corn pudding was served lukewarm at best.  Overall a disappointing experience.",

I enjoyed my experience here and plan to return.     As soon as you walk in you are greeted with the delicious smell of smoky barbecue.  The place looks spotlessly clean.  They have a sanitation grade of 99 posted above the register.  Everything is well organized and attractively decorated.       The employees were very friendly and sincere.  When I complimented the cashier on their sanitation grade she replied that everyone there takes pride in that.  There isn't table service there.  You order at the register and pick up your food at the counter when they call your name.  They sell some bottled sodas chilled in ice or you may serve yourself a fountain drink or tea.  Next to the drinks they offer a nice assortment of barbecue sauces to choose from.  They also have a bar with unlimited pickles, onions, and jalapenos.  Everything is convenient.       The food was great.  We both had the pulled pork sandwich with slaw.   This place offers some neat side dishes on their menu.  We both got corn pudding.  It was amazing.   The barbecue was good.  It actually had flavor and wasn't dry.  I wasn't a big fan of the slaw but everything else was bangin'!  Both meals were less than $20.  I consider that a fair price for what we received.     It's safe to say that we will be back!",

I ate all of my food and would eat here again, it just wouldn't be my idea.   We went in on a Saturday evening around 7:30 and there was a line going out of the door. After standing in line for twenty minutes waiting to order I realized that the line was so long and slow because there was only one cashier, Cameron. He was very polite, maybe that's why the other customers spent so much time with him at the register.   I ordered the regular brisket and mac&cheese and green beans for my sides. The brisket was good- tinder and smoky. The mac&cheese was a basic noodle with cheese sauce that I wouldn't order again, while the green beans were full of flavor from onions and pork that I could see. Those were probably my favorite thing I ate.   Since I was in line for so long I'd read about their Tuesday (all day) deal of 40% off their individual rib bones. I was intrigued so I ordered a rib bone too ($2.25 ea.). I was too full to eat it all in one sitting but I ended up cleaning the bone later. The ribs were better than the brisket.   All-in-all the food was good and the selection of sauces were a good compliment to the meat I had.",

I've been wanting to try a City BBQ and well luckily my work ordered catering for everyone a couple Fridays ago and it came from this location.  I give the catering group from here 5 stars.  They were timely and did a great job setting everything up with labeling it all.  But I'm here to rate the food!  What was offered: cornbread, salad, Mac and cheese, beans, sausage, pulled chicken and pulled pork.  Cornbread - not a single person liked it, it was the talk of the lunch, lacked flavor and crumbled apart.  It's like it was missing an ingredient or two when made.  The butter and honey did not help.  Mac and cheese - creamy but lacked cheesiness that I liked.  Very deceiving in looks, taste did not match.  I'm a Mac and cheese snob, so you got to be great here and this doesn't pass.  Sausage - just tasted like a package I could get at the grocery store.  Meh.  Pulled chicken - probably the best of the day, but I've had better elsewhere.  It was the saving grace of the meal.  Pulled pork - this should be the star of a southern BBQ restaurant.  While not bad by any means, I'm a person who thinks great BBQ is great when it doesn't need all the different sauces.  This BBQ needs that.  My husband smokes a better BBQ with flavor and ends.  Huge disappointment here.  Again, not sure the value people see in BBQ here, there are much better options in Charlotte that are worth paying for.  Luckily I never will have to here!",

I couldn't even get a \"hey, how's it going\" or \"welcome to city bbq\" especially being that it was my first time there..   I chose 1/2 slab rib with the corn pudding and collard greens for my meal. The corn pudding was good and I enjoyed it although the corn was a little hard and tough to chew. The collard greens were ok they weren't like mom or gma collard greens but they were ok.. at least they were seasoned.. I also tried the baked beans which were decent but had too much bbq sauce and I really only rock with baked gma style Mac and cheese so I didn't try the Mac and cheese  the ribs however I could probably eat all day. 1. I love ribs 2. They were good without sauce 3. They were good with sauce 4. They were fall off the bone good   I chose a few different sauces, my favorites were the original, apple, cheerwine, and mustard base..  Overall it was a good meal.. I had room for dessert even after my food but unfortunately they didn't have vanilla ice cream to go with the peach cobbler..  That should be a suggestion to stock vanilla ice cream .",

I got the tacos, wife got the pull pork sandwich, and our friends with kids got fries and some other stuff. My meal was very good. Our group asked me to go tell the staff that the fries were cold. I informed the lady at the counter, she said she would get us some fresh ones. About 25 mins later my friend's daughter looked me straight in the face & shouted out.. \"where are the fries?!\" I went back & spoke to a different girl & she said that she would bring them to me.. about 12 minutes went by & I noticed they were disturbing fresh fries to other orders, & we were neglected once again. So now it is time to shift gears & stay at the counter & remind you what was promised & who promised until I am satisfied as a customer(I hate having to do that).   The young lady that was working grill did not hide the fact that she was highly annoyed & upset that she had to drop fries in the grill after the kitchen closed.. but we got out fries!!! I was apparent that the staff there that night did not have good chemistry working together.   But at the end of the night, they asked how things we going & offered us some peach cobbler to go. So it will not be my first option to return, but maybe down the road.",

That causes me worry about how they attend to food handling.  Someone that may have been a manager came out and tidied up the common areas a little, but didn't touch any of the tables which were almost all dirty.  Eventually someone did come out to attend to tables, but wiped probably 20 tables with the same rag.  Silverware was of questionable cleanliness with visible food residue on some that I rejected.  I give the meats a solid average.  Sides were a bit below average which is disappointing considering how easy it would be to correct.  Pretty good selection of sauces, but in community use bottles that were dirty and sticky.  Looks like the place does mostly take-out, which is probably the way to go if you want to risk a visit.  Only other problem with that is that you can't legally park anywhere close to the door although several just parked in the fire lane.  I guess that's the way our society is today.  Good management could make this a four star for sure.",

I liked the Piedmont pride sauce (it had vinegar) .  The brisket was  delicious and had a good smoke ring. The ribs were equally as good, along with the corn bread. The star of the meal was the collard greens.  I got the plastic utensils due to the fact the real ones did not look that clean.  That's why it did not get 5 stars.",

And as a creature of habit, I would always get the same thing: Lolo's sandwich, mac 'n cheese & collards.  So moving back here & utilizing the light rail for work, I am so happy they are right beside my light rail station at JW Clay. So convenient!  And yes, I am still getting the same meal. Thanks to their app, it's so easy to place my order.  I rate \"OK\", because the couple of take out times & one time placing my order \"to go\" inside, I've had to wait & then get questioned about my order, as if their receipt print out doesn't say. I will say the food taste & quality is consistent, so YAY! there.  I think their prices are good, especially for the portions you receive. Parking is tricky, because they're in a busy area with other restaurants.",

I start speaking letting her know the issue and she interrupts me saying the chicken is checked with a thermometer and that I may see pink because the way it's cooked.  Needless to say as a customer I'm upset at being interrupted and not allow to explain my issue.  I advise her that yes I'm aware that BBQ can be pink but this is raw due to the texture.  She continues to say that it could not be, to which I responded OK I'll bring it to you and her response was OK do that in a tone that really set me off.  The rest of the food was good but the customer service skills have totally disappointed me as a customer.",

Just picked up takeout and it's the second time this location has screwed up my order in the last month. The worst part is that I went there on a Sunday right when they opened and nobody else was in the restaurant, so it's not even like they were busy. If the manager is reading this, you MUST implement a procedure where the folks up front verify that the what the folks in the back filled was the correct order. And if you are ordering takeout from this place, check your order because I feel like a fool for getting burned twice by these guys and not checking before I left the restaurant.",

She gave me a free drink, and two slices of cake for the hubbs b-day! She even checked in on us later! Southern raised so I know my BBQ. While it may not be Skylight Inn (The best bbq ever), it's really good! Brisket sandwich was moist, and love how you can pick your own sauces from the sauce bar! I had mac and cheese and it was good! Not too salty, and nice and saucy. Hubbs had the corn pudding, we both loved it! His pork was a little dry though, the only con. Tea was up to par, and the chocolate cake was amazing! Not too sweet, and super moist. Will definitely come back!",

The customer service was ok upon entering and ordering our meal but once our food came out there were items missing, not 1,2 but 3. Also we ordered banana pudding but they gave us chocolate cake instead we informed the waiter he said they ran out not sure why they didn't mention it as we were ordering but any who the food was delicious. The half chicken was juicy and tender surprisingly  the breast portion wasn't dry. The collards we're a little salty for my liking. The house made peach cobbler is a must try yummmmm, the chocolate cake was good as well just needed a side of ice cream. I loved the BBQ picnic look & feel. It was worth coming back again so I did. Now today I ordered take out I got the leg&thigh tender and juicy as I remembered. Mac&cheese was a little cheesy this time around. Potatoe salad was everything FYI it has celery in it. This time I made sure to order the banana pudding and it was all that and more yummmmy FYI it has Carmel in it so I was a bit skeptical but it served it's purpose. I will sleep good tonight.",

That's great, but I'm good with just a day. The chicken was our favorite of any BBQ restaurant. The pork was delicious and not too fatty. The brisket didn't need a knife, it just crumbled apart. It did have a lot of fat if that bothers you, but it came off easily. The baked beans were way too thick for us. They were in like a thick BBQ sauce and had chunks of brisket in it. Flavor was good. Mac and cheese was cold, but good. It wasn't anything special though. They are super quick. They have about ten different sauces, I liked the mustard and vinegar one. There is also one that is kinda thick like a duck sauce from an Asian place, it's great w the chicken. Def going back!! Yummy!",

We have always brought food home because the portions are so generous.  Seems it's a happy place to work.... everyone is always very courteous and willing to help!  We will definitely be back again!",

    "text": "Love this place! I don't frequent BBQ places, but this one has definitely made my go-to list. Everything is I tried was great: the hush puppies, beef brisket, pulled pork, collard greens, corn pudding, and even their potato salad! (And you know you can't eat everybody's potato salad.) on top of the great food, one of the managers came up to the table and checked on our experience. You could tell he really cares about customer service which is great. The only miss for this place is the Mac n Cheese. It would be better, way better. But everything else about this place made up for it, like the free samples of the sides before you buy. I really like this place; from the ambiance to the food, it's a hit.",

I had the Brisket lunch special with Collar Greens and Mac&cheese. Sadly the collard greens were the best part of the meal. The brisket had no flavor and I had to drown it in sauce to make in enjoyable. And the Mac&cheese was just terrible, I read a review that mentioned they tasted like plain noodles and I can't agree any more.",

It was my first visit so they included samples of the sides--(which are all an extra $2.39) A plain sandwich is $7.32 with tax. None of the sides were stellar and the pork was in large chunks, making it difficult to eat without a fork. It was good, but definitely not worth the price. One visit was enough for me.",

So happy we chose this place, the food was delicious as promised and the servers very friendly.   We had pulled pork sandwich and a pulled pork plate with sides.  The BBQ was delicious and the hush pupped on point, the corn casserole was to die for too.  We found out there is a location close to where we live and we'll definitely return.",

Had the brisket and pulled pork, both were solid. There were so many sauces to choose from, I tried just a few. Brush fire and Spice ginger. Both were good, and I'm looking forward to trying more. We picked up the banana pudding dessert as we left, yet to try that as of this revuew, but looked good. Very excited to have a decent BBQ joint nearby, even if its a 'chain'.",
