    "text": "One of the few classy places to eat in the airport terminal or any airport terminal for that matter, at least in regards modern air travel. Beaudevin has a relaxing atmosphere from the moment you walk up. Coupled with good food and good service it's a home run. This is how it should be for a someone leaving the comforts of home only to enter the loud, crowded and generally rude environment of air travel. I believe this is what the airline industry envisioned when it started its transcontinental service but apparently it never stuck.  Staff: The hostess was quick to greet and offered a number of seating options despite it being nearly full from others trying to escape the loud intercom and shoving crowds. I ended up taking the couches and made conversation with a group of lawyers. Yep, even the flock of Esq talking legalese was tolerable with wine and a comfy couch, lol.  Wine glass chandlers, combo wood and tile floors and soft tones on the walls set the decor while soft rock with a modern tone and cool jazz alternated from the sound system completing the ambiance, relaxing.  Food: I only had about 45 min and wanted to make the most of it so I decided on the Artesian Cheese Tray and despite it wasn't the best array of cheeses to complement the grouping of spanish reds (wines) I had already ordered I was quite pleased as it fit my palette perfectly.   Overall: After a day of hell jumping from one plane to another for book signing tour (Battle Ready, Memoir of a Navy SEAL Medic...in case anyone is interested) this place was like paradise while I awaited the last flight of the night to bring me home.  A must stop from now, in Charlotte, especially if I'm with my wife!  Take the time to stop at Beaudevin, you won't regret it. 5 Stars.",

It was good (the goat cheese was awesome) and a smoked bourbon Manhattan, which was decent. Would this be something I would seek out if I were going out to dinner with the wife? Probably not. But for an airport? Definitely",

Ordered the turkey reuben, one of the items marked as special or recommended on the menu. The sandwich was oily and tough. I ate just half. The \"dirty chips\" were just slightly stale potato chips, didn't eat them. Waiter never asked about the food or I would have been honest. At the end I reminded him of the salad, the farmers greens. It was good though not generous. Disappointing meal and not cheap.",

    "text": "After walking past so many disappointing & artery clogging food choices in the airport (Burger King, Papa John's, Bojangles..), I came across this restaurant, kind of tucked away in the middle of the food court and it seemed like a MIchelin star space compared to all the other options. It was quiet and relaxing, and helped make my delayed flight layover more bearable.  There was a good selection of food - 4 open faced sandwiches, 4 salads, and a wide variety of tapas and cheese & charcuteries. I opted for the Green Apple Salad ($11) with chicken (+$4) - it was a decent size and had arugula, crushed marcona almonds, and apples. It was light, refreshing and delicious. I would skip on the chicken - it was a bit on the rubbery side (almost like the \"fake\" chicken you get at Subway).   I got a little plate of cheese for $4 with 5-6 slices of bread, which was a nice snack.  I think this is definitely one of the healthiest and nicest options to eat at in this airport - having paid $11 before for burnt chicken, or $11 for a CPK Pizza or Chili's salad, these prices for a nice sit-down meal are not too bad. Fork over the extra few dollars to eat here, and pay for service, and enjoy your layover so you don't spend your next flight wishing you hadn't eaten all that fast food.  5 stars for a great airport restaurant - you almost forget you are even in the airport!",

    "text": "Beaudevin is a delightful escape in the Charlotte airport.  Hidden from traffic and noise by the much more pedestrian on the go bar, this chic wine bar features a rather robust wine list that is paired quite nicely with the tapas style menu.  When you walk in an L-shaped bar is on the left with ample tables on the right.  The wine menu is more genorous than the food, but both are excellent.  I would say the only draw back is that the wine glasses are a little over priced and the none of the dishes on the menu where robust enough for a hearty pallet.    All in all Beaudevin is everything you wouldn't expect inside an airport.  Good food, artfully done with pretty reliable accuracy paired with a rather impressive wine list.  Flying fancy free in Charlotte with a littlke time to kill - dine fine at Beaudevin.",

    "text": "I connect through CLT three or four times per year. Time between flights is generally very short, so it's my custom to stop at Brookwood Farms in the airport atrium to grab a pulled pork/coleslaw sandwich with a side of turnip greens. It's pretty good \"Q\" and a great stop before returning home to Baltimore (I grew up in Alabama, so I know good Southern food).  A trip last week was going to result in a 2.5 hour layover in CLT. Since it was going to be mid-day, I checked online to see if I could find some sort of sit-down alternative. Found reviews of Beaudevin and thought I'd give it a try.  This would never work if you didn't have a reasonable amount of time to kill. Airports by their very nature are hectic places and you'd feel like you needed to rush. With 2.5 hours, I knew I had time to sit and relax. You couldn't choose a better place for it. The restaurant is quietly tucked away at the back of the Atrium. It's just a couple of doors from Brookwood Farms BBQ, but feels a world away. You're in a quiet and calming environment watching the harried travelers from a comfortable distance.   Based on environment alone, I'd definitely stop again if I'm in CLT for a longer period of time. There's a pretty decent limited wine selection and several interesting 3oz flights if you want to try that.   I first ordered a 9oz pour of a Malbec. Kudos to the waiter for pointing out that there were two Malbecs available. The one I intended to order was 1/3 the price of the other.   I was in the mood to just relax from a busy week away, so ordered the charcuterie to start. The meats were good and serving plates were pretty, but the plate itself looked like someone just tossed some assorted meats in a pile. I saw several nice-looking ones go past, so must've just had bad luck in who prepared mine.  I live in Maryland, so had to order the crab cocktail. It was a nice-sized portion of lumb crabmeat, lightly dressed and served with crispy flat bread.  Food was good, but not exceptional. I thought it was very pricey for what I was served, but worth it to just remove myself from the travel experience for an hour. Service was very good and the atmosphere was very nice and very calming. Would definitely go again if I have a longer layover in CLT.",

It came out pretty quick but getting the attention of the server was difficult even though there were at least 3 of them to cover the 3-4 people in the restaurant. I did finally get the attention of one of the staff to ask for a coffee refill but was told my server will be back later and I'd have to wait for her....for a coffee refill. 10 minutes later she came around. 4 stars for the food but minus 1 for the service.  Overall, I'd come here again for the food but not if I didn't have at least 45 min to kill.",

    "text": "I stopped by here briefly while waiting for a flight out of Charlotte.  So glad that I got to the airport early for once in my life!    The wines are priced by the ounce and are offered in both 3 oz and 6 oz sizes which is nice in case you are short on time and don't want to gulp down an entire glass in a hurry.  I ordered a full pour of the Malbec along with a salad containing beets, goat cheese, and pumpkin seeds that came with a lemony vinaigrette.  The bartender gave me a generous pour and the food came out quickly.  The salad was good- my only issue being that it had shaved beets which I feel don't really count as beets given that you can't taste them.  However, this was outweighed by the ample serving of goat cheese on top.   Service was friendly and speedy; I suppose you have to be given that a lot of customers are likely on a tight schedule.  The menu has a lot of appealing small plates/dishes on it including a cheese/fruit/nut sampler, charcuterie sampler, hummus dip with veggies and baguette, crab cocktail, and a variety of sandwiches which looked great.    If I am ever in the Charlotte airport in the future I will make sure to set aside some time to visit this place again!",

I had the ceviche and roasted artichoke salad.   The Good; Service was excellent. The waitress was attentive and made every effort to come back and check in to see if I have everything I wanted.  The menu is head and shoulders more interesting and better for you than the options out in the food court. The layout and design of the seating offers you everything from a nice leather couch to the bar to standard tables with lovely cushioned chairs. Head and shoulders above any other establishment in this airport.   The Bad: While the menu is really interesting and has lots of tasty sounding options, the ingredients they are using are not the best. The Ceviches guacamole was dark and slimy and settled entirely to the bottom of the dish. The chicken I added was rubbery and pre-cooked, not nearly as nice as the salad itself. Also, hot tea may not be the most ordered item in a wine bar but considering the 'higher end' nature of this place having more than mint, english breakfast and earl grey doesn't take much effort.   Overall with a couple small additions this place wouldn't just be the nicest in the airport, it would be a standout anywhere.",

First of all, the decor is upscale and inviting.  With wine being a focus of this establishment, the wine bottles dominate the walls, very nice.  The menu is way upscale from the norm.  My Greek wedge salad had a beautiful presentation with three wedges along a long rectangular plate.  It was topped with a lemon vinaigrette, feta, red quinuoa (sp), and herbs.  It was delicious and filling.  I should not have ordered the turkey rueben.  It was not great and the salad had filled me.    They serve wine by the fluid ounce, brilliant.  You can order a little or a lot.  My NC Sauvignon(sp) was crisp and refreshing.  My server was friendly and attentive.  This is a great place to relax in the middle of a long trip.  It is pricier than the normal airport fare, but I found it worthwhile.  BTW, wouldn't it be great if Yelp had a spell checker that was food terminology friendly?",

Beaudevin fills that void and makes you feel like you're not really at the airport at all.  They offer many small plates, which is nice because I don't want anything too heavy before a flight. I tried the Small Cheese Plate (4 cheeses, dried fruit and nuts, fruit jam, baguette), and it was a great complement to the local NC wine I was drinking. I also got the Hummus with Roasted Red Pepper, which came with a tomato/cucumber/olive side salad and pita. Also a great choice.  I would definitely come back if I'm at CLT again.",

The reviews rate it head and shoulders above the other eateries in the airport and I agree. In my opinion if a restaurant can nail the service, food and ambiance then it's all good in my book.  When you step in here you wouldn't know that you are in a airport anymore.  The ambiance is relaxing with a cool green interior.  Sitting at the bar with my back to the airport, I feel like I stepped into a cozy neighborhood restaurant.  The wine selection is excellent and there are plenty of delicious items on the menu.  Friendly and super fast service is very appreciated at the airport and I was thankful on both counts here.  I will definitely come back and would recommend for anyone interested in tasty food with a relaxing glass of wine that takes the stress of travel away for the time you are here.",

I had a two hour layover and am so thankful to have found this relaxing restaurant.  The atmosphere was fantastic. Unless you were looking right out into the terminal/food court, you would never know that you were at an airport.  I did not want to have anything too large before I flew the second leg of my trip, so I opted for two of their tapas. I ordered the spinach fondue & cantaloupe prosciutto plate. The spinach fondue was delicious! The bread it came with was some of the best naan bread I have ever had and it was deliciously hot. The cantaloupe prosciutto was the perfect sized dish. It was cantaloupe wrapped in prosciutto topped with shaved Parmesan and balsamic. There were strawberries served on the side. I also ordered a glass of Moscato. The prices were fair for being in an airport. The service was right on par- attentive but not pushy/nosy, prompt and extremely friendly.   I would highly recommend this place to anyone traveling through Charlotte Airport.",

Quiet, reserved, classy is how I'd describe this place - especially for an airport restaurant. I had the Scottish Smoked Sandwich and it was great. The bread was made fresh that day and they were still slicing it (see pict). The salad was weak but that's ok as the sandwich made up for it. Not a bunch of beer on tap but they focus on wine hence, the name. Cheapest red wine for a 9oz pour was $10 though that's probably not bad. Jimmy the bartender was really friendly and offered me a sample of the chicken salad. I'm fairly particular about chicken salad as I can't stand heavy mayo based foods such as macaroni salad, smoked fish spread, etc. With that being said, I was quite pleased when I tasted it. The crunchy pecans, ripe grapes, and smoked paprika was a great combination. I'd put this place at 5 stars (for airport fare) if the prices were a little better.",

They have a fantastic wine selection, with a lot of local North Carolina wines that will be hard to find anywhere else. The prices can be a little steep,but for an airport, it's not all that bad. They also have a full bar, with a decent selection to make you most of the cocktails that you would want. I ordered an old fashioned the \"old fashioned\" way, not the modern interpretation or the 1950's style. Just sugar, angostura bitters, rye, with a lemon and orange peel. The bartender made kind of an inbetween, with a muddled orange slice. Although it wasn't what I ordered exactly, it still tasted very good.   I ordered a sidecar next, and the bartender didn't know how to make it. I gave her my recipe, but she forgot to shake it D: However, she quickly fixed it and made me a new drink.   Although they have a full bar, their knowledge of cocktails is a bit lacking. However, they make that up with a great knowledge of wine and awesome service. I got one of their malbec's and started talking about wine with them and it was really great to hear their knowledge about some of the local vineyards. I only wish that they carried some wines with some more weight and muscle behind them like a nice bottle of Australian Shiraz.   If you are unfortunate to have a sinfully long delay or worse, have your flight cancelled, you can w(h)ine about it with other like minded people at Beaudevin with some awesome drinks and even better service. If I'm ever stranded at Charlotte, at least I have a great place to hang out.",

We wanted to order dessert and another drink but didn't have time when our server finally came back to the table. We own a restaurant and deal with staffing all the time. Made the comment to each other while dining that it was yet another great restaurant tainted by less than average service. I would say the place is pricey but at $111 for 5 small plates and 2 beverages, I felt I got great value for money and have paid way more for lesser quality of food at other restaurants. While the service didn't match the food and decor, it won't stop us from returning to this restaurant. We are already planning to return next month.",

We ordered 2 different salads and a sandwich. All the food was delicious, beautiful, healthy and very unique. Compliments to the chef! And the staff was very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend it!",

I frequently have 2-3 hour layovers and I think I have tried every restaurant in the airport.  Beaudevin is a nice quiet reprieve when everything else is packed, and the food is very good, but my biggest issue is the hostess. So much, that I avoid this restaurant. It has been the same woman for a few years now but she always acts like she is doing the patrons a huge favor by escorting them to their seat. I also don't like sitting so close to a fellow diner when there are multiple vacant tables. I understand if the restaurant is full but one seat over should not be so much of an inconvenience.  The hostess doesn't seem to make any attempt to be pleasant and if she dislikes the public so much, surely she can find another job hostessing elsewhere.  One time, I will excuse. But every week, it's an issue.",

They offer wine by the taste (3 oz), by the glass (6oz), and large glass (9 oz) as well as wine flights. Prices aren't cheap, but can you really put a price on peace and quiet at the airport?  My husband and I each ordered a glass of wine and split the large charcuterie plate. The charcuterie was good and the wine was excellent. The restaurant also has sandwiches and dinner entrees if you are seeking something heartier than a snack.  Will definitely stop here again if I have a layover in Charlotte.",

I took a bite, and I thought it was a tuna melt.  Lightly grilled rye with no butter, and a filling  of orange mystery stuff.  I could not tell what the filling was, just a glop of goo.  No sauerkraut.  I bailed on the $15 sandwich, and since my plane was boarding in 5, ran next door and got an excellent BBQ sandwich with cole slaw and beans in 5 minutes for $10.   My wife talked to the server about the sandwich.  She said it was as expected, a mixture of ground turkey and Russian dressing.  We paid when we ordered, and were running for the plane so did not have time to try and get a refund.  Not a Rubin.  My wife's salad was very good.  The server was pleasant!",

I have eyeballed this restaurant a few times while traveling through Charlotte but haven't really had enough time (or so I thought) to try it out.   Today I had the roasted red pepper hummus - served with sliced cucumbers, red peppers, warm naan bread and celery.  It was very good.  I enjoyed it as a nice light appetizer.   I saw a few things I could've been happy with as a main course from the sandwiches, and salads menu but I chose to get an open-faced sandwich which was smeared with a cheese spread then had a layer of spinach, roasted artichokes, tomatoes, and greens.  It was yummy and light.   Our server with very fast and polite - the food was out very quickly - and I did not feel bad at all about the meal.

One coworker, the most churlish bastard one could ever imagine and who hates lettuce, ordered a BLT minus lettuce with a side of chips. He got the lettuce in the sandwich plus a side salad instead of chips. The look he shot me when the plate hit the table was venomous.   The second coworker seemed to enjoy his smoked salmon sandwich but was puzzled at the choice of raisin bread. He's a kid though and if that is the worst thing to happen to him this week he's living a charmed life.

I don't know where this place came from. I can't even find a website. It's almost like it was quietly placed here by a divine Airport God as our reward for dealing with TSA's across the lands. This is easily the best and fanciest place I've eaten at Any airport.   I ordered a bagel with a side of all the necessary ingredients for a lox bagel combination creation (herbed cream cheese, capers, red onions, tomatoes and smoked salmon). Everything tasted fresh enough for my liking. The salmon was great. Mind. Blown.   If you're flying into Charlotte and have some time to spare, check it out. I read they also have one in Chicago O' Hare and Miami. Travelers rejoice!",

When wines arrived we were advised that in fact there was a FULL BOTTLE of Heitz. Obviously we asked to substitute the lesser glass for a glass of the Heitz.

But first off, let me say that I've been in some nice European airports and Charlotte is putting them to shame.   Wandered in here to a beautiful little restaurant softly lit, dabbled with plants that has an amazing array of wine to choose from. Sat in the mock 'al fresco' area where a piano player plays right by the entrance on the concourse.  They also serve several local North Carolina wines if you are so inclined to try. Ceviche, fancy paninis, cheese platters, and melon wrapped in prosciutto are all perfect  menu accompaniments. Little on the pricey side, but infinitely better than lurking at the Starbucks. If you have a layover, Beaudevin is absolutely the best spot in CTL to wait it out.",

The waitress said it was a limited time offering due to restaurant week.  I was a little surprised that an airport restaurant was participating in restaurant week.  It seemed strange, but I did not ask for the details.  My tasting menu consisted of some a mini wedge salad, some whipped hummus with pita, a grilled chicken breast and some roasted potatoes.  Everything tasted fresh, and despite my chicken breast being room temperature I enjoyed everything.    Airport foods is usually a disaster and at best the quality of your local fast food.  At worst it can make travelling miserable.  Beaudevin is a refreshing change from this.  It was a tasty, fresh healthy meal.  I will definitely go back the next time I fly through Charlotte.",

I had the small chacuterie plate which prosciutto which tasted the same as the low quality you would find in any supermarket. Then I had the steack with mushrooms in a cabernet sauce, which tested horribly!!! It was more like a extrimely sour soup with piece of iron steack that had no test whatsoever and some white mushrooms. I return the main course and had the iron cheese blue steak instead! The bread was so chewy that I could bet it was wramed up in macrowave. The only positive experience was the service! If you have too much money to spend on crappy food this is your place. By the way this the 3rd time in my life that I returned food to the kitchen!!",

Plus, under the bar are electric outlets for you to power up your electronic devices while you wait.  The staff were friendly, and the server waiting on us at the bar was very knowledgeable.  The grilled vegetable open faced sandwich was incredible, and the bread was tasty.  The truffles were OK, nothing like Switzerland, but pretty good.  The local port was tasty.  They had a great wine selection, and even had some nice tasting flights of 3 glasses to choose from.  A highlight of the Charlotte Airport.",

I wasn't particularly hungry, but stepped into Beaudevin to escape the crush, and I'm so glad I did. The restaurant itself is peaceful, airy, and well decorated. I absolutely love the wine glass chandeliers that they have over the bar top. I took a seat at the bar and was greeted immediately; service was super friendly and efficient, and very knowledgeable about their extensive wine list. They also have power outlets on the underside of the bar which came in handy. The menu is small - salads, sandwiches, small plates - but held a nice variety of items. I had the smoked salmon sandwich and really enjoyed it. It came with HUGE pieces of smoked salmon. I'm talking like a centimeter thick, not like the nearly transparent slivers that you might get at other restaurants. The raisin bread wouldn't have been my first choice, but ended up working well with the herbed cream cheese, micro greens, fresh tomato and red onion. The wedge salad topped with diced tomato and cucumber was fresh, but unfortunately not dressed except for a small drizzle of olive. Overall I spent $27 for a sandwich and a delicious glass of Syrah, pretty typical for airport prices and well worth some peace and quiet in this otherwise crowded airport.",

    "text": "Beaudevin-All the beauty of wine.   Great place for a quick bite or a more leisurely tasting while waiting for take off.  This is my favorite spot for this in the Charlotte Airport offering wine tasting and tapas/small plates.  Caprese Skewers- The caprese skewers are served over arugula with a pleasantly sweet balsamic reduction that complements the peppery arugula well.  A simple but delicious and fresh lite plate.    Knowing the caprese skewers were on the lite side, I also got the shrimp scampi.  Together, these two small plates hit the spot.    Shrimp Scampi- The scampi comes with 8 shrimp in a nice scampi broth with onion, tomato, and a garnish of cilantro. Six pieces of baguette are served on the side for you to sop up the yummy scampi broth.  At first I thought it would have been nice to have 8 pieces of baguette to go with the 8 shrimp, but I was able to make it work and still had some left over to do some broth sopping.  The baguettes are just a little bigger than the shrimp making them perfectly bite size.  One thing to note: if you're not a cilantro fan, you'll want to ask for the cilantro to be left off.  It's not included in the menu description, but there's a generous garnish of cilantro on the scampi.  I enjoyed the cilantro, though there was a lot of it.   I did not partake in the wine or any of the great sounding cocktails.  There's  a nice selection of them.",

I chose the Carolina favorites wine flight and it was great!  They even provide an explanation of each of the wines you get in the coaster which was pretty cool. This makes it easier for me to purchase a bottle of wine that I liked. I had the chicken paprika salad and it was great!  It didn't have has much mayonnaise as some chicken salads do so enjoyed that. If I am traveling through Charlotte again and have a long enough layover, I will be back!",

Designed for a higher-dollar traveler and that's fine.   Extensive wine list. YES!  However, in my one experience, the food failed. Ordered Shrimp Scampi and some chicken flatbread. Weird and disappointing. The shrimp came out in a small hot skillet, but I was quite puzzled because it looked like a sizzling pan of large shrimp in boiling water with onions and other spices. This *ISN'T* shrimp scampi. Scampi, in my experience, has at least some white wine, garlic and butter. This whatever they brought out had NONE of that. Basically about 10 shrimps in a sizzling pan of hot spiced water. What can I say?  The flatbread. Disappointing. It's such an easy dish to prepare. It was soggy, and basically prepared very poorly. Very little mozerella and tomatoes, and some chopped up chicken breast on Indian naan. Fail.  I asked the waitress Is this supposed to be Shrimp Scampi, because it isn't. Immediately she responded back to ask if I wanted to order something else instead. I said I don't know. She came back a few minutes later and again I asked her about the dish and she said, Yeah, well that's what our cook labeled it as, scampi. She just laughed a bit and ran off.  For a nice upscale refuge such as this was hoping to be, I think they failed in the food department. Maybe it was an off night, who knows. It was a Tuesday evening about 730PM.",

I wasn't too impressed with the wine list, but there are a range of options. For food, hubs and I opted for the meat-heavy antipasti. The cornichon and the stone-ground mustard were fantastic, as was the hard salumi. All of the other meats, though, seemed very bland, out-of-the-package varieties. The ambience was definitely more quiet than your average airport stop, servers were friendly, but maybe a bit too friendly if you know what I mean. While we were there, we saw them serve to a total D-bag who was already waaaay too tipsy and then laugh about it. They also regaled us with a tale from earlier in the day about a near fist-fight over a loud cellphone convo. Come prepared to hang, clearly. Still though, I feel comfortable with my three stars. Boudevin is probably one of the better stops in this airport. I'll admit, wIth the menu, I had high expectations. Have y'all ever been to a Surdyk's? They can be found in the upper Midwest and the the one at the airport is the bomb. Although Surdy's this isn't, it's still a-ok.",

My wife and I had a 2012 Justin red blend after studying the wine list for a long time.  $118 ain't cheap but the wine retails for about $70 so the markup was reasonable and we had the time to sit and drink and enjoy.  The cheese platter was a bargain at $13, not bad cheese plus apricot jam, dried fruits and nuts.  Definately something to share.  We split the garden salad with goat cheese which was very nice.  We also had the hummus (we had a 4 hour layover and a company credit card).  Also about perfect.",

After the frustration of being stuck in CLT overnight, I went to the airport Sunday morning (yes in the same clothes as the day before) and went to have breakfast.  I saw a place that I never noticed before, looked at the menu, and yes, they had me at prosciutto scramble.   Well you know what I ordered...and it was fabulous  (The service was great as well)!  The very flavorful scramble was served on supremely buttery and flaky mini croissants; This was a great start to the day.     The location looks awesome for lunch or dinner, the ambiance is clean and modern, the food choices look interesting and the wines / drinks look like they would be great as well.  (It made me excited enough to even drink wine :D).    As a somewhat frequent flyer through the Charlotte Airport, I will be back at \"the beauty of wine\" again.",

I can't speak for the wine since we were not drinking today, but the food and the ambience were well worth the stop.  If you have kids that are decently behaved, don't hesitate to bring them. There isn't a formal kids menu, but he servers are accommodating and will make grilled cheese and fruit plates for them and don't give you that crazy look because you brought a kid there.   We tried 2 of the salads - and you can add protein too if you like. We also tried the turkey rueben recommended by another review and they were excellent! So nice to get something other than fast food at the airport! It was also somewhat secluded and thus quieter than the rest of the airport. A great break for our trip.",

As a frequent traveler I am always disappointed with Airport food offerings (hometown Austin airport is among the worst).  However, there is a new breed of Airport restaurants slowly becoming available.  If Beaudevin was located outside the airport I would probably give it a three star rating, but while in the airport it is an escape from the surrounding madness.  Offering wine by the glass (at a great value), small plates, coffee, in a quiet, clean, and friendly environment; Beaudevin is far and away the best option while in the Charlotte airport.   After surviving TSA, another delayed flight, or just the typical maniacs, do yourself a favor and grab a seat at Beaudevin.",

We'd begun our day at 4am - with a 90 drive to an airport - then our flight with connection in Charlotte.  We had a four hour layover.... needed breakfast and a way to begin the day again...  This was the spot!   Nothing about it 'felt' like an airport restaurant -  or a chain formula restaurant for that matter..... I just want to say thank you to the restaurant staff for their smiling, kind, personal attention, and very efficient service.  You all made us feel relaxed, and maybe a bit pampered - the food and coffee were WONDERFUL - and we felt we could take all the time we liked (granted, the restaurant was not horribly busy at that hour).   We headed to our next gate feeling far better than when we arrived.  The rest of the day went smoothly (or at least we coped very well)  - and I honestly,  truly feel it was in part due to our great experience at Beaudevin.  Its really amazing how one experience can sometimes make, recover, or sour a whole day - even when your trying your best.  Again, thank you to everyone at Beaudevin for making our day !!",

Just to put it in perspective for you - Buffalo's Airport - my home terminal, sucks as far as food options go.  I've never been to Maddie's outside of Gate 16 and I sure as hell won't be going there anytime soon.  Which sandwich would you like to get at Which Which? Which one?  You lost me - who's on first?  Sometimes his wife comes and picks it up.    But Beaudevin was a fresh of breath air (wait for it...) for airport cuisine.  Fellow Yelpers may recall a question I posted in asking where to find a good  charcutuerie in Buffalo.  No one really had what I was looking for - which, thanks to NYC's Eataly, will never be topped.  But, I found a close second at Beaudevin in the Charlotte Airport.    Clean, serene, prompt and tasty.  Well done.",

The bitter and hearty arugula leaves are balanced by the sweet granny smith apple and Spanish bacon. The crunch texture from roasted almond and julienned apple make the salad very pleasant to bite. The grilled chicken on tartine is so juicy. I was expecting card board dryness like most airport vendors, but the grilled chicken is pre-marinated well and grilled very right. Excellent service and atmosphere. The friendly waiter told us the apple is from DC. We don't have so sweet green granny smith apple in California. Maybe the earth in DC is somehow more suitable for growing apples.",

The Grinder sandwich was terrible, thick cold bread with few slices of very thin meat (one piece of prosciutto and few slices of ham) with tomato slices and pickled green beans. I would have just bought sandwich like this at any of the express counter in the airport. They would probably taste better than the one we had here.

Very modern but comfortable. Tons of space at the tables to store your bag, spread out comfortably, and relax. You will not feel cramped here unlike most other restaurants in airports. This is a five star feature of the restaurant.  Service was awesome. Pleasant, friendly and fast.  Wine selection is decent, pricey for a 9 oz pour, but ya know, the airport thing. Wine is served in stemware, so that's cool. I got a nine ounce French Rose for $15.  Food. Based on my single visit and only ordering one small plate, I get the impression that a lot of their food is prepared off site. I got the red pepper hummus which was described as being accompanied by toasted nan, sliced cucumbers, radishes, and olives.  The Reality was the nan arrived warmed (maybe in the microwave even), and the olives were tapenade on top of the hummus. The veggies had been sliced at least many hours of not a day or two prior, and were not the crispiest I've ever had. Also, the hummus had a cumin flavor going on, and for my tastes, cumin does not play nicely with hummus.  Get ready for paying more, but overall I had a decent experience and recommend you give it a try.",

    "text": "I visited here since Bruce K. suggested it was the top restaurant in the airport and Trip Advisor and Yelp also seem to agree.    If you cant find anything on their decent sized menu, make sure to glance at their chef's tasting menu (specials), which are sometimes a better deal and come with a side, like their quinoa apple salad.  I chose a simple farmer's salad since I had a large lunch and added seared salmon, similar to Jenny L.  Although, they have replaced the smoked salmon as an add-on for $5.50, with the seared salmon for $7.50.  I'm sure you can still add smoked salmon if you really wanted.  I prefer the seared, and mine was seared to a medium to give you an idea.  The only ingredient I didn't taste in the dish was the vinaigrette.  This is a great little salad where the goat cheese adds a nice contrast to the leafy lettuce.  I sat at the bar for optimal service in a busy airport and there was no one seated next to me.  Some of their wines are pricy, but they offer various pour sizes to fit most budgets.",

    "text": "This is a respectable establishment with a touch of class in an airport.  I should empasize an American airport, as they do not really compare well with Europe.  It is pretty noisy for a wine bar, but kind of quiet for an airport eatery.  To some extent, the prices keep the clientele at a level of sedation.  However, the need for a corporate base to sustain the atmosphere means the prices are actually quite shocking.  One six ounce pour is close to the retail bottle price.  I chose the Black and bleu sandwich with chips.  Though uninspired, it was satisfying.  I paired this with a glass of Sangiovese.    To follow, i chose the Carolina's Finest flight of savignon blanc, a white blend, and a cab (made with California grapes).  This was quite pleasant.  I added the three smallest truffles I had seen in a while.  Anyway, the sticker shock and industrial, managed ambiance rates a middle of the road review.  It still may be the best in the airport.   Eat well, tip well.",

    "text": "My fiance and I have wildly different ideas about what a timely arrival at the airport entails. I want to be there in enough time to account for any traffic / long line / drug sniffing dog finds you interesting disaster. He, who travels all the time, believes it all works out in the end so there's no reason to sit around bored for hours. However, I am hoping Beaudevin will bring him closer to my way of thinking. Why? Because it is actually a rather pleasant experience to sit here with some wine and small plates.   Other times I've had wine at the airport it has been served in an odd shaped plastic glass. Not so at Beaudevin where my 9oz pour was brought in a proper wine glass with room for the red wine to mellow a little bit. They also have delicious looking small plates. We were having dinner at our destination but my fiance bought me a chocolate truffle tray as a surprise snack. Wine, chocolate and a comfortable seat is all I really want from life in or outside of an airport.   Yes, it is a little pricy but considering it is in the airport it wasn't out of line with some of the equally pricy but nowhere near as elegant options at the Charlotte airport.",

Thankfully it was located near my concourse or I would have said uh no. So glad I went! Gorgeous decor, relaxing and elegant. Had a cocktail and the grilled salmon - both were delicious! The salmon came with an amazing beer salad and asparagus. Excellent, professional staff. Highly recommend!",

I had a lengthy layover due to a delay as I was heading out to Nashville for vacation... my friends were already out enjoying happy hour, which meant I needed a jumbo glass wine to cure my FOMO. They delivered! I had a glass of rose - I opted for the larger pour, which was about a glass and a half. I grabbed food as well, going for something heartier than the cheeseboard that I really wanted, but I need a True meal after a long day of traveling so I ordered the chicken blt sandwich. It was panini in essence with grilled focaccia bread, tomato and spinach. I ate the whole thing and it filled me up! The salad on the side was lightly dressed with a sweet citrus dressing.   The service was speedy, which is what you want in an airport dining experience. It was nice to sit down and feel like I was in a restaurant-like environment even though it was an airport.

True, there are no prices on the posted menu board, but the waiter handed us a menu when we asked. Amazingly, prices are reasonable: our family of four ate for under $50 (no wine or drinks). We arrived hungry, and everyone had plenty, so portions were fine. My open-face chicken sandwich was delicious, as was the Mediterranean Salad. Lots of veggie options. Bruschetta was delicious and served as a meal for one in our party, as did the charcuterie platter.  If you walk in the back entrance by the bathrooms, you'll see a sample of prepared plates, and a deli counter that shows the meats and cheeses they use... all decent eats.  Food came out quickly, which is a feat. Note that we were one of four tables when we landed, so YMMV. We were in/out in 45 minutes. There are no \"chicken nugget\" kiddie items on the menu... YAY! But, plenty of attainable and tasty options for everyone.  Next time I'm flying USAir thru Charlotte, this place will get another visit. Hopefully, other Yelpers will keep this place afloat. Only spots that rival this are in Terminal 2 @ SFO... with San Fran prices. A REAL WINNER here.  My only wish: that there were a couple high-end cultish or hard-to-find wines by the glass. Since Beaudevin has the fancy nitrogen wine dispensers, you can already get a lot of neat wines by the glass, like Caymus Cab. But there was nothing on the list I just had to try right then. Minor quibble.",

The shrimp might have started out jumbo, but they were cooked down to be the size of popcorn shrimp. They were tough and lacked any flavor. What once might have been a sliver of avocado was nothing more than greenish slime in the bottom of the bowl. This dish was mostly just acid sludge.  I also ordered the spinach salad. The first thing delivered was an arugula salad. I should have kept that. When the spinach salad came, it was overdressed (again, pure acid) so that the croutons were just soggy flatbread.   I had a flight of wine. The Riesling was surprisingly good. Not too sweet. The Sav Blanc was vaguely reminiscent of warm swamp water.  Wishing I'd packed a kind bar in my bag. I won't come back to this place. I suggest you not either.",

And the tapas style small plates kept wowing one after another. From the prosciutto & melon to the cheese plate to the caprese skewers, to the bread plate and olives. The only average ones were the shrimp cocktail and the humus. Not bad mind you, just not up to par with their small plate siblings.  And as for the salad mains, I did the grilled artichoke. A solid good. The creamy whipped goat made for a nice complement to the peppery arugula.  Oh, and our server was awesome. Quick, friendly and without writing anything down she didn't forget a single order from the 6 people in our party.",

Given that I fly through Charlotte regularly, makes me to sad to know that the top rated yelp place is the airport is disappointing AND grossly overpriced. Happy to pay for a nice meal if that's what I'm given. Getting the sense that this place is riding on good yelp reviews and its status as the only \"nice\" restaurant in the airport.

It's a comfortable place and, when the piano is going in the courtyard, you can enjoy the additional ambience.  There are plugs all along the bar (underneath) for your laptops.

Each graduation in size is just the price of the 3oz times 2 or 3.   I had a nice glass of wine that I thought was $12 each... I had 2 and it turned out they were $20 each!

I love a great cheese plate, however the sliced cucumbers had been cut way too long ago, then we're stored in cold refrigeration.

Hidden in plain sight, in the main concourse, behind the Airport Sushi stand(which is surprisingly good), lies the CLT airport gem: Beaudevin.   The pours are good and the food is pretty tasty, no matter what you get. The wine selection is decent, and no one should be surprised at the airport per-glass-prices.   Beaudevin is great as a spot to decompress  and relax between flights or get some work done. It's set far enough from the concourse to stay fairly quiet unless there's a robust group in the restaurant.  Pro Tip: there's charging under the bar!",

It's very possible to zoom in and out of here on a short layover, which I really appreciate on days like today. They have an expansive wine selection and make great pairing recommendations. I'm a fan of the smoked paprika chicken salad sandwich, which has pecans, a very light mayo), and overall a nice texture and consistency that I don't often see with chicken salads. I had it with a wedge salad, which normally I'm not a fan of because of my general desire for tasteless iceberg lettuce to go extinct, BUT they even managed to make it flavorful and accompany it with a balance of tomatoes, peppers, and oil to make it enjoyable.   The strawberry peach Bellini is also quite nice. Note that the speciality cocktails run around $16, which isn't surprising given airport + wine bar status.   Super friendly service and a quiet respite from the main terminal. I pretty much make a beeline over here as soon as I get off the plane, every time!",

We ordered the afore mentioned plates as well as a chicken club to share. It was a lot of food for two people. All of it was delicious and very reasonably priced, around $35. (We drank water and Diet Coke).   The only caution I would give is that service was a tad slow, but we had a lot of time to burn so it suited us just fine to sit there and relax.   The place offers a nice variety of seating: a bar area, tables, benches, and if you want that laid back homey feeling you can sit on a couch and use the coffee table!",

I would have actually liked it cut a little more thinly because I don't need that much. The salmon is plentiful and I love the bright lemon juice, salty capers, creamy feta, bite of red onion, juicy tomato chunks and fresh greens on top. This was actually quite a filling sandwich.  My only major gripe is that it has sometimes taken me a while to get seated, but the food usually comes fairly quickly.",

I ordered the chicken pesto flatbread and was very disappointed.  is was soggy, flavorless, and the chicken tasted like it was previously cooked and then frozen in a factory - I bet there's a big plastic bag of it in their freezer.

What does the word fondue imply to you? To me, I picture hot bubbly cheese. This was a cold spinach artichoke dip. Hmmmm... not what I was expecting. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special and it was totally overpriced beyond belief. The other food looked good, so I guess that was my mistake.

    "text": "At the outset, I want to say that this four stars as airport restaurants go. I would not otherwise go here. It is, however, the best place to eat in CLT.  I've eaten two meals here in the past three days.  Lunch: an open-faced salmon sandwich, caprese salad, and iced tea. (No wine.) It was perfectly tasty. Service was prompt and friendly. The bill came to about $30--expensive generally speaking, but worth the money for a healthful airport meal.  Dinner: an open-faced chicken sandwich, a cheese plate, and iced tea. (Again, no wine.) The chicken sandwich was OK. The cheese plate had dried fruits, nuts, and a tasty selection of four cheeses (three soft, one hard), with quite large chunks of cheese. Mysteriously there were neither crackers nor bread, but instead a few triangles of pita. Spreading brie on pita was a strange experience, and not a particularly tasty one. (I suspect that the late night kitchen staff just isn't aware of how soft cheeses are generally served or consumed.) I quickly ran out of pita, and found myself just shoveling soft cheese into my mouth with my fingers. Again, service was prompt and friendly--especially for 10:15 at night--and the bill about $30.  I'm not in love with Beaudevin, but I hate every other food option at CLT--everything is greasy, reheated, meat-and-bread-laden fare, with hardly a fresh vegetable or fruit in sight. Sure, it's HMSHost-owned and -operated like every other restaurant in the airport, but even given that, Beaudevin is a breath of fresh air.",

I would recommend allocating just over one hour for lunch and that is simply sitting, ordering a drink, ordering lunch, eating, paying.  No after lunch chatting.    Decided to try Beaudevin as an alternative to the traditional airport stuff.  It is pleasant looking and you can either sit outside where the action is going on or go inside for a respite from the activity.  I sat outside but if I return I will sit inside. Prices range from $15-23 for a good lunch plus drinks.   The wine I ordered was very nice but at $19 for a 9oz pour one would expect as much.  I ordered the BLT with a salad.  The salad was the highlight of the meal.  The BLT was good, not great, but good.  The server was extremely pleasant.  The only downside was the time it took for the overall experience.  My opinion is that it is a kitchen issue rather than a waitstaff issue.  However, if you have a bit over an hour to spend on a good meal and glass of wine at CLT this might be your place.",

The hummus was delicious and served with veggies and pita.  My friend and I both got our own salads.  I got the Mediterranean, and she got the Artichoke salad.

Stopped in for a quick bite before my flight and ordered the smoked salmon and artisan bagel with herbed cream cheese along with an order of fresh seasonal fruit. The bagel and salmon were as expected, nothing to write home about, but satisfying and met my expectations of smoked salmon and a bagel. I was kind of ticked off by the fruit bowl because it was 3/4 full of old grapes when the menu said it would be fresh assorted berries, and the few berries tasted like they had been hanging out way in the back of a fridge in need of a new baking soda box. On top of that, my bagel plate was served with a heaping cut of more grapes and like, if you told me the garnish is pretty much the same as the side that cost another $6-7, I would've just settled for the garnish.",

Price is what prevents it from being five-star. Their namesake wine was about triple the price you would expect, so we stuck to beer...good to be an omnivore! At $18, the chilled lump crab cocktail was a relative deal. Elegant, minimalist preparation showcased the high quality ingredients. Wife enjoyed her turkey melt.",

    "text": "Unfortunately if you're looking for a place to work in the food court area, good luck. The outlets in the poles have been disabled, so there's no electricity. With that said, this restaurant has outlets, and per my request, I was seated at a table next to one. Since I had a 2.5-hour layover, I had plenty of time to get some work done.  I really liked this place. The service was excellent. When I explained to the waitress I had a long layover during which I would work on my laptop, she immediately understood and only came around to refill my water. Sometimes at a restaurant I am bothered too much by staff, but this was thankfully not the case at Beaudevin.  Best of all, the Scottish Salmon open-faced sandwich ($15.70 including tax) was delicious! At first glance, you would think that perhaps it's not enough food, but I struggled to eat the second half! The salmon was fresh, the herbs were just right, and the bread (raisin bread?) had enough sweetness to give more flavor. All of the flavors were balanced, and I really liked it. The presentation was remarkable (see photo), and I think all restaurants should strive to be like this, regardless if in an airport or not!  The food, great service, and the calming atmosphere in a chaotic place was wonderful. I would definitely come here again!",

Spendy, but acceptable if you consider I'm paying airport captive audience upcharge so whatever.   Come to find when I get the bill that glass of wine actually cost $26. Oh really? What I hadn't noticed was that the $13 option was for a 3oz glass of wine.   On what F#$*#&$ planet is a glass of wine 3 ounces? You people should be ashamed for tricking tired customers like that. Shame on you! And don't even try to tell me that it wasn't deliberate because of course it is. If you want to pretend that this is something cute and special you do, then MAKE IT CLEAR UPFRONT TO EVERY CUSTOMER EVERY TIME.   What would have otherwise been a splendid dinner by myself left me very upset and feeling cheated and taken advantage of. Lucky for you that you rely on a steady stream of travelers so you don't have be decent people to get repeat business to stay open.  I also waited for about 5 minutes to be seated and was not acknowledged once. It was not busy at all, just understaffed. When no hostess came, I sat at the bar. I saw no fewer than five customers come in, look at the sandwich case, wait for service, and leave having never been acknowledged.   The food itself was great. The waitstaff that were there were pretty pleasant, if few in number.",

The people at the next table ordered at the same time, but their food was served long before mine. I was not offered a drink refill and everything seemed to take twice as long as at the next table.

First that is way too many cheeses on one sand which and after I ordered mine I done know how that will all even fit! I went with the creme only and it was perfect.   The bread was really good and you get a good portion of salmon. Yay brain food! It is a bit on the heavier side so I would recommend if your hungry.",

A co-worker and I used a small 1.5hr layover in Charlotte to swing by (it's between major terminals) to grab a quick bite to eat. The interactive iPad set up tells you a lot about the wine options available. The waitress was also spectacular at recommended local North Carolinian white wines to taste. She was also more than willing to give samples, which was nice.   In the way of food, we grabbed the cheese plate. The apple compote, cheese, dried fruit, and bread was a great add on and filled two of us up for lunch. (Not the most filling, but it was enough to tide us over for four more hours.)   Nice bonus: there was a grand piano outside the restaurant, which someone played. Not sure if he was hired or just another traveler on a layover, but it was fabulous!",

I was having such a good time sitting there drinking my wine and eating my cheese that I almost didn't want to leave when it was time for my flight.  If it was anywhere else, I'd say it's 4 stars, but because it's in an airport terminal, and by miles the best restaurant ever in an airport terminal, it gets 5 stars.  There's bar seating as well as a small area with couches and normal tables, and I opted for a table with outlets nearby so that I could charge up all my electronics.  The service was amazing.. the hostess/waitress stopped by to make sure I was always taken care of with drinks, water, food, etc and when I asked for the bill she offered to charge my card at the same time, since she knew I was hurrying to make a flight (after sitting there casually for 2 hours I almost missed it ha).  They have an extensive wine list and every food menu item has a suggested pairing.  I had the open faced chicken sandwich which was absolutely delicious.  It came with 4 pieces of bread topped so it was a generous serving size for the price.  Because it was so good, I knew that I wanted to try something else here. So I decided to overeat and also had a small cheese plate paired with the suggested Riesling.  The small cheese plate is also very generous for the price, and probably would have been enough for me as a meal. I still ate most of it.  With the AA / US Airways merger now underway, I may be spending a lot more time there. Because of Beaudevin, that's now an okay thing.",

The steak sandwich was small for the price (I know there are airport prices but still) and not very flavorful. The bread was nice and chewy, steak was overlooked and under seasoned, and the aoli was flavorless.  The charcuterie salad was ok, I think the Dijon dressing competed a little too much with the other flavored. A balsamic vinaigrette would've probably been better. The turkey sandwich was comparable to the steak sandwich, not much flavor. I probably wouldn't eat here again.",

The atmosphere, located in the middle of the atrium was decidedly un-airportish; urban sophisticated, fresh, and calm.   I ordered the charcuterie salad- I thought the pickled green beans might be odd, but they were fantastic and worked with the rest of the salad perfectly. I also ordered the citrus crab cocktail which was an extremely large portion of crab meat and delicious!   Then I got the desert flight and OMG. No really, at one point I literally exclaimed \"oh my God!\" It was so good. What an unexpectedly fantastic meal!  Staff was perfect- friendly, efficient, and only around when you needed them.  I was able to charge my phone and pass a very pleasant 2 hour lay over. The only place I'd eat at this airport!",

I had the bagel with salmon lox, and it was pretty good.  This place is going to cost you a bit more than most of the other food around, but it gives you a way to escape from the busy areas of the airport.",

It's not cheap, but I enjoyed the meal.   Service was efficient, but not overly attentive. It's obvious they are more attuned to travelers rushing for a flight than those wishing to linger.   I ordered the cheese plate and Farmer's Salad. The salad was wonderful; field greens with pumpkin seeds, shredded beets and goat cheese. I would have like bigger chunks of beet as the shreds didn't impart that great beer flavor. There was a nice balance of goat cheese on the salad. Topped with a vinaigrette it was a nice overall salad.   The cheese plate was also good. 3 cheeses including a nice Brie and blue. Also on the plate Marconna almonds, dried fruit and apricot jam. My only complaint - I would have liked some crackers or more bread. I ran out of bread before I ran out of cheese and the server was no where to be found to see if I could get more   Overall, a nice respite on amid the chaos and a nice surprise.",

But before 11:00 AM, they have a really decent breakfast that you shouldn't miss, as long as you have some time.  Comfortable seating area that's recessed from the atrium (which runs between Concourse B and Concourse C) so it's away from the noise and hubbub of the airport. Proper tablecloths and actual metal cutlery (yes, the knife has a rounded point) on a pretty glass plate.  I had the egg scramble, which came with a nice bunch of grapes and a mini-croissant Portion was great, the flavor was great. Cleaned my plate. The coffee had a nice fresh-brewed flavor to it, served in a decent sized cup.  Pleasant waitress (Nicole) took care of me and promptly.  No, I didn't have any wine but they did look to have a good selection.",

I ordered a farmhouse salad & Scottish smoked salmon tapas plate, along with a 3oz pour of Sauvignon Blanc just to have something to sip on. The farmhouse salad was refreshing & light, but with punches of flavor from the goat cheese & crunchy texture from the pumpkin seeds. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of were the beet spirals in the salad -- it would have been awesome to have roasted beet chunks instead, but w/e, just a minor detail.   I really loved the smoked salmon tapas, which came with 4 rosettes of salmon, each with 2-3 slices of salmon rolled up & bits of capers, onions, & microgreens, all dressed with some creme fraiche & a light white sauce. There was plenty of flat bread to stack the salmon onto, it's so nice when a restaurant provides you with adequate bread/crackers!   I guess the prices are a bit expensive, but considering that a mediocre & skimpy smoked salmon bagel might cost $13 in your typical airport, I'd much rather spend a couple dollars more to eat a high quality meal at Beaudevin. I'm counting down the days to when I fly back home from my business trip, so I can make another trip to Beaudevin & try the flight of NC wines!",

    "text": "While traveling with my daughter, we had a long layover in Charlotte. Desperate to find something better than the typical chain restaurant, we found Beaudevin. We were seated away from the noisy concourse.  I had the open faced roasted vegetable and goat cheese sandwich. The zucchini seemed a bit more pickled than roasted. The fava bean salad served with it was divine. I had the suggested paired wine that worked well!  My daughter decided to skip the late supper and have the berries and chocolate. It was a gorgeous presentation (yes, at the airport) and was delicious. Simon was a perfect waiter, bringing what we needed when it was needed. Our portions were generous, beautiful and tasty. It seemed no more expensive  than any airport meal and much better than any other restaurant options.",

    "text": "The Vegetable Sampler had an unusual collection of flavors. Bartender was knowledgable and patient with the wines. I ended up with a tasty local white. Computers available on the bar. Only problem was, despite efficient service, we relaxed so much, we almost missed our connection",

    "text": "Totally mainstream wine list. Nothing interesting even though the menu has sections like \"Interesting Reds\" & \"Interesting Whites\". There was nothing on the list that you would not find in your average wine store. Largest flight pours I have come across. I want to taste not guzzle. Add to that the price and I know who Beaudevin is trying to emulate but they have a long way to go.",
