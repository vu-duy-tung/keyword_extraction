    "text": "This visit brought 9 of us in for dinner, thankfully with reservations!  Jordana was a wonderful waitress, very attentive & knowledgeable about the menu & tequila.  Tortilla chips - Warm & lightly salted, with not ONE, but TWO salsas! The staple red salsa & my favorite: the verde / tomatillo. Again, Jordana kept the chip bowls filled.  My kitty margarita had just the right amount of tequila & \"bite\" to it & was in a reasonably sized glass.  I decided to go with the shake down shrimp taco & gringo beef taco. I'm not a big fan of beans or rice, so thankfully Jordana said I could substitute other sides. I went with the BBQ buttered corn & a double helping of the chipotle citrus slaw.  Shake down shrimp taco - lightly breaded & seasoned nicely. The shredded cabbage made a nice compliment, as did the pico de gallo.  Due to my overloading on chips, I was unable to finish the beef taco or corn. I took this home to the boyfriend & he loved both. :)  Dion L. - resident foodie! :) also wanted us all to try the chimichanga, which was AMAZING! Luckily, 4 of us shared bites of it. It was full of flavor. Dion & I commented that it tasted like something yummy from the fair.  The atmosphere was cozy & warm, it didn't necessarily have a \"theme\" that I could tell, although their were a lot of warm tones of brown & amber. The music was rather interesting...jumping from rock to country every other song. :D  Overall, I'm pleased with my trip to Paco's.",

    "text": "Ok, listen. Overall, it was good. Not my favorite, but good nonetheless. The margaritas were really good,  chips were warm and crispy, salsa was WAY TOO HOT and I like spicy, but I couldn't do it, so she brought over salsa verde, which useless. Not everyone like shit that hot. Just make the shit mild so EVERYONE can enjoy it. The  guacamole was one of the best I've ever had, mine is the best. Me and Baldie ordered the tacos. You have to order two or more in order to get the combo price, otherwise it's all ala carte.  I ordered the shrimp taco and the brisket taco. Baldie ordered steak taco and beef taco. We made the mistake of ordering them in a flour tortilla instead of corn, which looked like flatbread, much thicker than a flour tortilla. That came with a nice portion of choice of beans, we picked refried, it also came with rice, which was good. Frank didn't like his beef taco. My shrimp taco was pretty much filled with shrimp and the brisket was flavorful and tender.  So, I definitely go back. Next time we make a reservation, that place was mobbed!!",

Smothered in a black bean sauce they were seasoned well with goat cheese inside. A-maz-ing. My date got three tacos, the fried chicken was his favorite but the steak one was a little fatty he said.

I ordered one paco taco (beef brisket) and one chicken taco. They were both amazing and served quickly. Meat was very fresh and flavorful. Tacos come with beans, rice, and coleslaw on the side.

I added a bacon stuffed jalapeno which is a must if you like spicy.  The service was just as great as the food. They refilled our chips before we were even done. Not just putting new chips on top of the ones still in the basket, but giving us a full basket of fresh ones. Also, the manager came around and refilled waters. I would say we had a total of three plus our waitress serve us.  Overall we can't wait to come back to Charlotte and for Paco's to be our first stop!",

I read the food reviews in advance and tried the chicken taco and my husband had the chicken taco and bbq shrimp taco combo.  The tacos were great, although, beware, the bbq taco is quite spicy like it states, but very tasty.  The portions were large.  I ordered a single taco, beans and rice and was full and my husband had the two taco combo and was stuffed (guess it could have been those two beers as well!).  He was also pleasantly satisfied with the beer selection.  For those who have small children, the cheese quesadillas are quite tasty.  Generous with the cheese and not grilled to a hard exterior like most places.  And all kids meals come with a free scoop of real vanilla ice cream.  That kept our 20 month old busy for a while.  And the customer service, albeit it the place is still relatively new and trying to make a good impression, was outstanding.  We are pretty picky when it comes to restaurants and it's nice to have a good option for good food when you're in the mood for mexican.  We will definitely be going back and I would highly recommend it if you haven't tried it already.",

The cocktail list, or rather, Margarita list is awesome. I usually don't care for new twists on classic cocktails, but these guys got it right. I suggest the \"Firestarter\" a vodka martini w/ fresh muddled Jalapenos, it's aptly named. And their newest addition, \"the Ruslty El Camino\" which is essentially a classic margarita w/ blood orange puree. Their tacos are awesome, even if you don't eat meat: check out their whitefish taco, or their calamari taco, they both rock. Bonus points: I took a vegan, and there were numerous options, all of which she enjoyed. It's hidden in South Park, so I've never had to wait for a table, and they play great music: lots of Wilco, Johnny Cash, and even a little Drive By Truckers. Great, now I'm hungry.",

    "text": "I've visited this restaurant several times now so it certainly has that \"IT\" factor that keeps ya coming back for more.  I typically come in the evening times so its usually fairly busy but never to where my date & I have to wait to be seated. In face we've managed to get the same exact booth on every single visit (what are the odds of that LoL) The staff is really good about letting you know what drink specials are offered as well as food to recommend. My date has always been a huge fan of the \"unholy guacamole\" (and now i'm a fan too) which is freshly prepared right at the table side to make sure it's just like you want it. The classic margarita is solid but the grapefruit version wasn't all that tasty (or was just mixed poorly) so drinks maybe hit or miss there. The main course usually does not disappoint, I have been experimenting with various tacos, the traditional seems to go better with the hard shell, but the soft shell works better with the more exotic choices on the menu. The meals are filling and haven't been able to muster up room for desert but they do make sure to offer it to you if you desire it. The atmosphere is pretty lively, they have a patio area if you choose to dine outdoors and there are also plenty TV's locked in on sports if you want to catch a game. I'm looking forward to hanging out here Cinco De Mayo or really anything you are in the mood for a good mexican dish, I would make my way over Paco's pronto!",

When I got there I was promptly greeted and took a seat at the bar.  I ordered a bowl of the Chicken Enchilada soup and it was huge!  It was filled with pulled chicken and was certainly a meal all of its own!  The flavor was good, but was missing something in the broth.  That being said, I would definitely order it again but just a cup so I could try more tacos!  The chips were warm and crispy and the salsa had a great slightly smoky taste.  They were fantastic!  The bartender also made me a margarita on the rocks and it was really good, however it was too sweet for my taste and I didn't even finish it completely!  I really wanted to try a \"street\" taco and ordered a fish taco.  It was good, the batter was a bit salty, but overall it was good!   I will definitely go back on my next trip to Charlotte to try something else on the menu as overall this was a very tasty meal and I would recommend it.  The price was relatively inexpensive and was a good value for the quantity.",

Upgrade for $1 to the side salad..definitely worth it!  We will go back here next time we are in Charlotte!",

The salsa and chips was so loaded with salt it was ridiculous.  For the price they charge I would rather go to Biombos. The waitress was so over zealous that we couldn't even get some conversation in without her hovering over us every 2 minutes. She definitely needed to cut back on the 5-hour energy drinks. It was almost creepy. The drink prices were ridiculous especially the tequila shots. On average, 10 dollars a shot. This place had serious potential but fell short. Not going back to this one, sorry.",

From the chips and salsa to the margaritas to the queso, the tacos, to their homemade flour tortillas! Everything was excellent. I was iffy about it at first being a tex mex restaurant but my friend knows my love for Mexican and I trusted her opinion. I'm glad We came because now this is easily my favorite Mexican here! I tried 3 different tacos and each was excellent! They are also huge portions of tacos so beware that your stomach is as big as your eyes! I got the cucumber jalapeno margarita and it was amazing as well, very refreshing! The service was also excellent! Our waitress was on top of drink and chip refills with no hesitation! I already can't wait to come back!",

He didn't even comp my sons kid meal.  He was soaking wet and we had to leave.    Another time the waiter forgot to put the kids meals and anyone with kids can guess what ensued when it took 15 minutes after our adult food arrived for the 1, 3, and 5 year old to get theirs.... again nothing whatsoever was done.

    "text": "I would come back here for the chips and salsa alone. It's the perfect storm of thin white corn tortilla chips and a delicious homemade salsa. Not too smoky, not too spicy, not too tomatoey. Tableside guacamole was great as well. We filled up way too much on that stuff. I will never learn my lesson.   They had $3 OMB pints on Sunday, thats a pretty good special in my opinion. So good that I skipped the margaritas and had beer instead.   I ordered the Too Big Taco Salad and was not really impressed with that. And I know, you're thinking well you ordered a salad what do you expect. But I ordered the salad because I knew I would be eating a lot of chips and didnt really want anymore chips/taco shell/tortilla and the salad was mostly chips.   My boyfriend got 3 of the tacos. We liked country fried steak the best. Tastes like a cheesesteak taco. His two favorite things. The other two (fish and Paco's Taco) were good too. The homemade tortillas really make them. The taco plates are very generous portions with good-sized tacos and rice and beans.   We sat at the bar and service was efficient but not friendly. The bar seats are oddly uncomfortable. It's like the backs are too curved. Would go for a table next time.   Definitely want to go back!",

    "text": "Very good food! Very horrible service!   I am giving this place 3 stars only because the food is a solid 5 stars. Indeed, this is the only good Mexican restaurant I can find in the Charlotte area that can be anything close to authentic.  Although, the style is much more Tex-Mex and not what I am use to from living on the West Coast most of my life.  I am giving the service, however, one star!     The place is very crowded and obviously, understaffed.  I've had a few problems coming to this restaurant.  The first time I came it took them over 45 minutes to get me my meal and I almost had to walk out, but the meal finally came and I was just visiting Charlotte and starving that night, so I waited.  However, my third time coming I ordered a beef chimichanga.   Well, when I received the order I started eating it and finally noticed they did not give me beef, but chicken.  I mentioned it to them and they were not sorry at all and did not offer to reimburse me.  Instead, they said, \"OH YEAH, THAT HAPPENS A LOT HERE\".  I am like WTH???  They made me pay for the full price of the meal and did not offer any compensation or any apologies at all..   I guess TOUGH LUCK if they screw up your order, right?   They could have marked a little off my bill, since I did not ask them to bring it back and re-cook it.  As well, the servers are always unfriendly and act like you are bothering them. I always go to the bar because the place is so packed and really does not have enough space for the amount of people who go there.  I don't even bother coming to this place on the weekend.  The owners need to find a larger building or hire more staff.     Seriously, this place has horrible service and even makes me question if I want to come back.  Charlotte is hurting for good, authentic Mexican and that is why this place is so popular, because it is quite good.  However, expect to be treated like you are a burden. Basically, the only thing they want is your money.. They want to seat you, slap food on the table, take your money and get rid of you as quick as possible.  It is not a very uplifting experience to eat here, even though the food is good.",

Anyways, I had never been here before and the restaurant is actually a decent size. We sat next to the kitchen entrance, right in front of a television (it was football Sunday!).  When I sat, I was almost immediately greeted and asked if I knew what I would like to drink.  My friend and I were chit chatting a bunch (we had not seen each other in quite a while) and she did check on us twice before I was ready to order - which was perfectly fine! She was very polite about it. When it came down to it, I asked her opinion and I took her suggestion.  I ordered two taco platter; the paco taco and the shrimp taco, no beans.  The food came out relatively fast. But I was munching on chips and salsa (the salsa was a bit hotter than I expected, but definitely delicious!). The rice was nice, not dry! They did provide a slaw but I did not eat it too much - but it wasn't that bad. The tacos... the brisket one (Paco's) was flavored nice but the taco was over stuffed and when I bit into it I grabbed wayyyy more meat than I wanted and it was a mess. So instead I just ate it with my fork. The shrimp taco was good (but not enough sauce). The shrimp and battered and fried. The server was super nice and sweet. She checked on us just the right amount of times and was not overbearing.  The food, was not the best but pretty good. I definitely will be back!!",

There were complimentary chips and salsa but the chips had no salt on them and the salsa was rather flavorless and runny.  I wasn't too hungry so I ordered a taco plate for $7 (decent price for the portion). I got the tanked up taco which is a fried (or grilled) fish filet which was really tasty. My friends all got generous portions in their tacos too so it was hard to eat them without the contents falling out (not a bad problem too have, really). You could choose to have a four, corn, or crispy tortilla which is nice.  I got the charro beans which tasted like watery baked beans with shredded pork... not a fan. I'd probably go with refried next time.  The rice was pretty flavorful but the slaw was average. Service was okay. I'll probably come back for their enchilada...eventually.",

Things to remember about the tacos- they are BIG.  If you aren't a big eater two may be a lot.  They also come with slaw, beans and rice.  There's a ton to choose from.  I also like the fish, but any are delicious.  They also come with a choice of 4 or 5 different tortillas which include wheat, corn, flour, low carb...maybe another!  Try this place out for delicious Tex mex...but with a place like Pacos Tacos- trying the tacos is pretty much required.  They also have different drink specials depending on the day and a nice little patio.  If you're having a taco craving in South Park, this is the place!",

In a nice little very clean shopping area (the restaurant was packed but they text you when a table is ready so having the nice shopping area to walk around helps).  We took one lap around, went back in and found a seat right at the bar so we were able to cancel the \"reservation\".  The guac is made tableside and is a must.  All the typical ingredients including 2 avocados.  Almost a meal by itself.  My wife and I split three tacos (fish, pulled pork and I cant remember).  All were excellent.  Margaritas, the defining item at a Mexican restaurant were really good!!  We had both with and without the house made mixture.  Not too sweet or sour or acidic.  Very nice!!!  While we were staying at a close by hotel, this place is worth a side trip.",

    "text": "Paco's Tacos automatically gets a star for awesomely rhyming their name.  I could say that all day...Paco's Tacos.  Well done, branding team!  But really, that's not why I come here.  As far as Mexican Restaurants go in Charlotte, Paco's gets a solid gold star.  This place is always packed.  Usually I sit at the bar so I can be a bit more relaxed.  The bartenders won't bother you because they are running around making drinks for the tables, so if you want something, you have to flag them down.  Decor is pretty standard and welcoming.  It's not a modern or rustic or modern rustic vibe.  Just good ole' Mexican Restaurant decor.  Food is, well, YES.  I recommend starting with the cheese dip.  It comes out quick and it's really good.  You can add beef or chicken to give it some extra flavor.  TIP:  Add a side of Tortillas for $1.  It's like you can make mini quesadillas while you wait for your meal.  If you're not full by then, order the tacos or fajitas.  Usually I am full, so I end up with the small chopped salad with grilled chicken.  The menu is pretty \"health friendly\" if you can stay away from the chips, but has lots of the good stuff for those who want to splurge.  Margaritas are a little on the sweet side, service can be a bit slow, and this place can be a zoo around 7pm.  If you're willing to put this aside for some decent Mexican Food in the South Park area, Paco's Tacos is your place!  FYI-Bar is great for a date or hanging out with friends or by yourself, while the rest of the restaurant is family friendly.",

These tacos are pretty large. I couldn't finish three but it's a better deal to get three instead of 2. We also had the bartenders special margarita that night. It wasn't much different from a regular margarita except it has an orange slice. The service was excellent. The atmosphere is awesome and the price is good. I'm a new fan and will be returning FOR SURE!   Also, make a reservation.",

Super fresh, delish, tasty guacamole every time, served with those complimentary chips which again is very tasty. The complimentary salsa is damn good too, would love it a bit more spicy though. We ordered couple corona's and order the mix and match taco's.  Couple Al Pastor and Wood Grilled Chicken taco's.  Phew 3 tacos sound like small portion right, but these are huge taco's served with rice, beans and slaw.  That's a huge portion enough for two.  Loved Al Pastor -  the pork was perfectly cooked and it was juicy and delicious.  What could go wrong with chicken taco it was perfect as well.  The beans was just as delicious and so was the rice. Always love the vibe at this place, and our waiter mentioned that Paco's was ranked 2nd best tex-mex in the country last year. Interesting!!",

    "text": "I haven't had the best of luck lately with Mexican places but I was craving it tonight and decided to try someplace new again and ended up here.  Everything surprised me here.  With the chips and salsa, normally the red salsa is the spicy one.  At Paco's, the tomatillo salsa is the spicier of the two.   The chips were kind of average though.    I had trouble deciding on a margarita so I went with the Firestarter which contains jalepeno-infused tequila and ginger beer.  That was actually the spiciest thing I had tonight which wasn't a bad thing. It just caught me by surprise.    I ordered my meal (Paco's Tacos) and I swear two minutes later it was sitting on my table.  What surprised me about this is the sweet sauce on the tacos which was a nice contrast to the spiciness of the salsa and the margarita.  It also came with Chacco beans, rice, and a slaw.   Considering I am not a big beans and rice person, the rice has to be good for me to finish all of it -- and it was.  For dessert I tried the Tres Leches cake which came out beautifully presentted and well it didn't go away the beautifully but it was gone by the time I left.  All in All, Paco's is a nice surprise.  Prices are decent, the service is excellent and the food is wonderful.  This is definitely worth coming back to!",

In my opinion, the prices are too high. My dish was $13. It was a lot of food, but I'd rather have a smaller portion for less money. My husband had the quesadilla, which was very small (3 pieces) for $10. He ate some of mine because he didn't have enough. Because he had the same dish for lunch before, he realized the lunch and dinner portions are the same size, but the price increased at dinner.

    "text": "I came here for lunch with work for the first time last week. The place was packed and the inside looked pretty fun, so I was expecting everything to be amazing.  Nothing here was bad, just lackluster.   In the restaurant's defense, I ordered a salad... which I guess is pretty boring most places, but I think it's a restaurant's time to shine. Anyway, I ordered the Chopped Salad, which is vegetarian EXCEPT for the dressing. So I substituted the Chipolte Bacon Ranch for the Honey Cilantro Lime dressing. Otherwise the salad was good, just boring and VERY skimpy on the toppings.  Highlight of my experience? The chips and salsa were good!   Even though the place was slammed, we did have really great, quick service. Well, except for my friend asked for no sour cream on his salad and it was there anyway.. but that's a kitchen problem I suppose.  I would be willing to try Paco's again, but can't say I'm terribly thrilled to do so at this point.",

I like the menu so much in fact that I noticed I purchased the same exact thing the last time I was here. After i post my most recent pictures I noticed I ordered the same last time.  This place has more than enough reviews in which I'm sure are perfect. I  most likely won't be able to add much to the already made reviews other than the food is good.

There's nothing authentic, original, or interesting about this place. And so pricey for what it is! I'd rather eat with the roaches at Azteca or some other real Mexican place in Charlotte than in this faux roadhouse with their weak drinks and oppressive food. If you must go (because your co-workers insist or whatever) just stick with the basic tacos and drink water.",

She basically lives across the street, so we added it to our must-see list on my recent visit. We met our cousin and her daughter for lunch and I was very impressed. The staff was on their game; the chips and salsa were delivered quickly and were yummy, and our waters were always full.   I ordered the small chicken quesadilla with a side salad. In hindsight, I wish I had just ordered a large salad because the side salad was one of the best I've ever had! It had a little too much dressing (ask for it on the side) but there were chickpeas, peppers, avocado, corn, etc etc etc in this salad. SO YUMMY. The quesadilla was good with a decent amount of salsa/sour cream/guac on the side, and it was a good value for the lunch. YUM.",

Paco's Tacos was located a super short distance from the Marriott South Park which was great since we didn't have a car.    I ordered the cucumber jalapeno margarita on the rocks and it was delicious.  The margarita was not too spicy and refreshing.  For an appetizer we ordered the chips and guacamole which was made table side.  The bowl was towering with chips and definitely a generous serving.  I tried not to fill up on chips but it was a challenge.    For dinner I ordered the pacos tacos which was braised brisket, grilled onion and a chipotle sauce on a corn tortilla.  Again, not too spicy and the onion was mild and didn't over power the flavor.  You have the option of picking what kind of tortilla you want and I went with corn.  You were also able to pick your beans and I def made the right decision with picking refried.  These refried beans were amazing... I wasn't expecting abnormally delicious refried beans.  They were smooth, creamy and had a very subtle kick of spice.  I loved them.  The meal came with rice which was good but I preferred to eat the beans and chips.    The service was great and I enjoyed my meal and experience.",

    "text": "Maybe it is because I neither tried Paco's tacos nor his tequila but I was not enamored with this restaurant. It was an A-OK experience overall. I will say we had an excellent server considering we were a work group of 12 and basically took up a whole back corner.  I sampled several items and here is the breakdown:  Complimentary chips - yes! Warm and salty in the best way possible.  Complimentary salsa - not the worst I've had but definitely bland.  Smoked jalapenos - my favorite item of the sampling! I thought they were perfect but the more spice sensitive members of my group thought they were too much and were wishing for some milk.   Chicken tortilla soup - more broth than substance with a lot of tortilla strips. I loved the addition of avocado.   Refried beans - strange oily aftertaste.   Charro beans - I would probably order these again over the other bean options but wouldn't seek them out.  Rice (that I didn't order) - bland. I requested two bean sides with my meal instead of rice because I am not big on rice. However my meal came with rice and I sampled it because it was there. Kind of matches how I feel about rice in general.  Enchiladas de Dennis - my second favorite item sampled! Smothered with queso and stuffed with chicken and spinach I would happily order these again.  The decor is nice and the restaurant is clean but overall the food wasn't particularly memorable. Maybe I will return one day and try some of the food after having some of the tequila and will be a more enthusiastic patron.",

I would give this restaurant 5 stars alone based on their Volcano Queso (queso with pineapple + bacon) but everything about this restaurant is 5 star. I have been here countless times and there are so so many dishes to highlight. Like I said, the volcano queso is a MUST-GET. I was wary at first of pineapple in my queso but who knew it was everything I needed and more ????? The guacamole is made table side and is always so so fresh. My favorite of the tacos is the steak taco with the peppers and onions. The meat is sooo tender and easily on my \"top tacos of all time\" list lol. Lastly, if you like fajitas, the steak fajitas are amazing. If you are in the area, definitely put Paco Tacos on your list.",

It's about a 40 minute drive from my house, so unless it was a place that friends were wanting to meet, I wouldn't go out of my way to dine there.  If I could have given a 3.5, I would have.  I ordered Paco's Taco which came with Spanish rice, slaw, and a choice of beans.  The taco itself was good and the first bite made me go, \"Wow!\" but apparently all of the sauce in my taco was in that one bite.  After that, it sort of fell flat for me.  The rice was okay, but the slaw was pretty dry -- like just shredded cabbage.  I didn't taste the citrus or the chipotle in it.  The side of Charro Beans was the most flavorful thing on my plate -- and I did enjoy them.  The salsa at Paco's is also really good -- perhaps the rest of my meal just suffered by comparison.  We did receive good service from Henny!",

Chips and salsa were brought out promptly and the waiter recommended the white queso because we wanted a smaller portion.   We devoured the queso pretty quickly and the server brought more chips right away.  We split three tacos for dinner.  We got the pacos taco, skirt steak taco, and grilled white fish.  My favorite was the pacos taco (yes it's worth the extra .50 cents).  The grilled white fish was fishy tasting, so we should've gotten it fried.

On my most recent trip with a friend, I got the taco and soup lunch special. I selected a pacos taco and chicken tortilla soup and it was amazing! The one thing I would change is that I would ask for the tortilla strips on the side for the soup because they got pretty soggy after a little while. Next time, I will order tortilla strips on the side and just add some as I go. The taco was delicious as always. My friend ordered the chopped salad with chicken and used the salsa as the salad dressing. She commented on how great it was.   This is a spot that I will go to again and again and again.",

Good enough to come back or nah?  I had great food and service during my first visit to Paco's.  The food came out fast and my waitress was really nice and helpful. Can't remember her name because of course I was only focused on the food at the time. We began with the smoked bacon wrapped jalapenos. I think there was cheese inside but I was focused on the bacon, which was nice and crispy and definitely not undercooked or burnt. I had the enchilada sampler which was good overall. My least fav was the roasted veggie enchilada.  There was cinnamon-y or something flavor that was just weird and the black bean sauce over top made it look unappealing.  I ordered the Texas mule to drink which was pretty tasty but I should have gone with a margarita.  My companions had the outlaw steak fajitas and the ambushed shrimp.  I tried the shrimp and it was really good but honestly anything wrapped in bacon is gonna be dynamite. I left Paco's stuffed and planning a return visit.  Yum!!",

Queso, so great you'll never not order it (not if you love cheese as much as me!) I've had most of the tacos on the menu and have yet to try one I don't like. I highly recommend the Rusty El Camino margarita, but be careful if you're driving because it's a deliciously strong one!   Let's be real, you can go to RuRu's tacos and tequila but not get free chips and salsa and pay the same amount for a margarita that's half the size of Paco's. By far, best Tex-Mex the the CLT, and yes I've tried quite a few places.",

    "text": "My wife and I eat here regularly, but most recently we had a life changing experience at Paco's.  We recently had a child and while that seems like a useless piece of information, it is, until it isnt.  You see, we had yet another sleep-deprived night last night (as all good parents do) and our beautiful demon baby couldn't stop screeching all morning. It's a Saturday morning, so what do we normally do? Oh Home Depot, Bed Bath and Beyond, we'll see. Might get a little crazy. Well, after we called our parents and both sets of them laughed at us, they gave us some of the best parental advice that's been passed down from generation to generation... drive her around!   So we did.  Plopped our little porkchop into her tank of a car seat (have you seen these things recently? That's why mom's in south Charlotte don't need to hit the gym. Doing curls with a 25# car seat will give you guns to rival Arnold) and off went.  Magically, it worked!  After cruising the mean streets of South Charlotte for an hour, we realized that we broke the cardinal rule of new parenting: don't forget to eat and drink plenty of water. My wife realized she didn't eat for the last 3 meals!  What are we to do? I flipped up the Yelp app (product placement) and we decided to stuff our faces with South Park's finest Mexican, Pacos Tacos.   We were nervous we were going to be the only ones there at 11:05AM, looking completely haggard from a tough night.   The good news?   That's where all new parents go for the \"early bird special\".   We were even more nervous that our hellion was going to lose it and we were going to be \"those parents\". You know, the ones who let their kid wail in the middle of church because they couldn't properly manage their kid's blood sugar?   Well Pacos had us covered there too. The dull roar of the kitchen and Willie Nelson's soothing tunes kept our daughter quiet during our entire meal. (Yes, the ENTIRE meal)  Bless you Paco, you saved the day.  You know what else is great?  Getting the first food served of the day.  My wife's fajitas were perfect.   The unholy guacamole, lived up to it's name.   My steak quesadilla, burrito, two tacos, and enchiladas?   Hot, delicious, and made with love. (So what, I'm a stress eater... want to fight about it?)   Later that day, we all made it home safely, our daughter slept for another hour and my wife and I, well we got the best hour nap of our week.  Thank you Pacos, we are customers for life!",

I knew the moment that I pulled in to the outdoor, upscale shopping center, that this was going to be a typical chain Mexican cuisine with inflated prices. Yes it's like walking into a Chili's with Mexican decor! The margarita special of the night had no tequila in it, and it was so tart and sweet that we kept pouring water in it to dilute it! The Chicken and Steak Fajitas combo we ordered to share was delivered with skeptic looks from us. For $19 I was expecting even more than you'd get from your favorite American Mexican spot! Well it was more like a 1/3 of that amount with a separate plate with a dab of sour cream, guacamole, shredded cheese, tomatoes, and a couple of shredded lettuce particles! Despite the overpriced incredibly small portion size of this dish, the skirt steak was really good and equally impressive was the tender chicken breast slices! Despite the quality of the two meats, they tasted like anything you'd get from Applebee's or Chili's. The rice, charro beans, tomatoes, guacamole, and cheese were all just bland. The one highlight though is the house made tortillas! These are phenomenal and straight out of some street vendor in San Diego! Perhaps I'm spoiled now? Perhaps I'm just over these mall style Mexican restaurants with their weak $12 margaritas? Or perhaps we should just expect better? You could certainly do worse than Paco's Tacos, but you could pay half that and find something way better in the ever more available taquerias that dot every city's landscape!",

Authentic Mexican? Not a chance. However, this place does serve REALLY good Tex Mex!   Fresh chips and excellent salsa? Confirmed! I added some delicious Chili con Queso and voila, excellent way to start off the lunch.  My friendly waiter made some recommendations and I went with them. He suggested the slow braised beef brisket, and I also selected a chicken fried steak taco. Man both were really excellent! Very flavorful with sweet/heat contrasting flavors. But while i knew the brisket taco would be good, the chicken fried steak was even BETTER! Halleluiah! Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Highly recommend this one!  Oh and the beans. Can forget about the charro beans. They have brisket in them with onions. Very savory and tasty. The only negatives was that the rice was average and the cole slaw sucked. But who cares when the mains are this good, right?  Overall a great first, but certainly not last, dining experience at Paco's Tacos!",

I was in heaven and literally could not stop eating the chips. I will definitely be visiting here a lot more once I officially move back to Charlotte.   I also got the queso with the chips and it was really good; however, I feel like there wasn't as much queso as I would get at other places.   Overall this was a great experience and the perfect lunch spot!  UPDATE: I recently went back here and was reminded how much I LOVE their guacamole and queso. My friend and I are already planning our next visit.",

But I wasn't ready for the amazing flavor packed into the \"Too Big Taco Salad\"! Amazeballs! I mean this salad was amazing and one of the best taco salads that I've ever had. I know some of you may be thinking \"a salad,REALLY\", but this was no mediocre taco salad. There was a layer of tortillas at the base, but not your ordinary tortillas. These tortillas were thick cut and super crispy to withstand all of the flavors atop of it. Next there was black beans, queso cheese, romaine lettuce, fresh cut sweet corn, tomatoes, chilli lime dressing and I topped mine with a piece of grilled chicken. Yoooooooo.... this salad was foodilicious!",

For the restaurant week menu they had the no name margarita to start with. We all got it frozen. It was a lot bigger than I anticipated so well worth it with the meal. Choice of appetizer was either queso or guacamole. 3 of us had the question and 1 the guac. Both were very tasty. Our waiter made sure to keep our chip bowl filled so we could enjoy the guac and queso. Second course was either a salad or chicken tortilla soup. We had both. Both tasted good. Main course was a choice of 4 different entrees. 3 of us got the choice of three tacos and one got the tipsy chicken. I really enjoyed the the turkey club carnita taco. It has some sort of jalapeno bacon in it and it was really good. For dessert the choice was either peanut butter chocolate pie or tres leches. 3 of us had the pie and 1 had the tres leches. The pie was really good as was the tres leches. If in the area I would stop into the restaurant again",

They have several salsas you can ask for, make sure to try the habanero and verde if you like a little more spice.  The chips remind me of Salsaritas...but better.  We also ordered a small queso and it was one of the better queso dips I've had.  The drinks are pricey but strong, I could only do one margarita.  The food is good, I got the grilled shrimp taco and skirt steak with rice and coleslaw.  My husband got the build your own combo with the same tacos and one enchilada.  I have to say the enchilada was the best.  Cano Fish taco still beats any tacos in Charlotte!",

Clearly, as it was May 5th, the place was slammed... The upside to this being a solo mission?  No waiting for a table... I just pulled up to the bar and perused the snazzy menu... I met a nice guy named Joe who told me that the shrimp tacos were really good... I wasn't really all that hungry because of the ridiculously tasty and filling brunch I'd just had at Vida, so I didn't want a whole big platter... I noticed that they do a singular taco option, though!  Perfect... :)  The couple beside me (in from Greensboro and completely sweet) also heard Joe recommend the shrimp tacos and echoed his endorsement... I figured I'd give it a go, then... I decided on the broccoli with queso and one shrimp taco...  They're called the Shake Down Shrimp and I'm not really sure why, but who cares at this point?  They were amazing... They apparently make their own tortillas and that was a tasty base, the fillings are fried shrimp, shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, cilantro, chipotle ranch and Cholula (hot sauce)... Now, I just started to eat shrimp, but I am still a no-go on ranch, so I had mine without the sauce... I guess that would have cooled down the spiciness of the dish, but I was loving the heat factor...  The herbs, cabbage and pico all tasted fresh and delightful... The cabbage had a really nice crunch... The broccoli, you know, tasted like broccoli... That queso was insane, though... A total blanket of cheesiness with a minute fiery kick...   The bartenders were attentive and friendly... Even while they were slammed with all the people surrounding the bar and filling the restaurant's orders... I can't wait to go back and actually enjoy sitting down in this place for a while... There's something called a Firestarter margarita (with jalapeno infused tequila) that has my name on it...",

They offered to replace it, but he declined.  The restaurant is crowded but not too rowdy/noisy that two people out on date night can't hear one another.

I've been to Southpark a million times and always overlook this shopping center across the street.  Paco's is there on the side and has nice, indoor and outdoor seating.  Nice menu and the chips and salsa are wonderful and I'm pretty sure they fry them in a separate fryer so they're not comingled with wheat items.  I had 2 tacos Brisket and Shrimp and they were wonderful.  They certainly don't skimp on ingredients and the tacos were totally on point.  My daughter had the Smokey & the Brisket taco also and she really enjoyed it.  Best of all, we topped it off with $.50 ice cream for dessert.  In my situation where I enjoy eating out and have to find places that won't have my daughter puking her guts out afterwards I have grown to appreciate places like this.  Paco's will now be on our rotation for good, solid, food in Southpark!  Great job!",

My employer's regional office is in South Park, so this is one of a handful of restaurants my co-workers frequent when we're in town for a meeting or training. I've never been here for dinner, but I highly recommend Paco's for a tasty and hearty lunch.  I typically get the tacos- they have several different combos that are good. Brisket, fish or shrimp, skirt steak, and gringo beef are all good. The sides of rice and refried or black beans are a good compliment. My favorite other than the tacos is the \"bacon egg and cheese\" enchilada. It has jalapeno bacon with a chili/gravy and a fried egg on top. Not the healthiest thing in the world, but so tasty!    Service is typically good. It can get slow during busy times like many other places, but I don't remember any issues. I can eat here once a month or more and still keep coming back.",

They were \"bomb\" as he said.   I got the Tanked up Taco (grilled) and the Crispy Shrimp. Both were delicious and FULL of flavor.

The veggies were seasoned perfectly and I could have just ate those and skipped the chicken. My friends ordered the lunch taco plates and they were all satisfied. The chips, queso, and guacamole was also a pretty tasty started. I mean can you ever really go wrong with queso?!

We had the feeling that we were on the right track as people seemed to all be heading in the same direction as we approached. We could shortly see why. Upscale, delicious Tex-Mex. would be the simplest way to describe Paco's. We both had 2 delicious tacos and can't wait to go back for more. My only complaint would be to have a beer special every day. Otherwise, perfection.",

Had SUCH an amazing waitress (Ashley) who made the entire experience memorable. She's a veteran at what she does and completely genuine. Her attitude was positive and full of energy the entire time which was appreciated. She recommend the best margaritas and convinced me to try a palette of shots. (She repeated the name of all the shots at least 5x and for the life of me I cannot remember.)   Will absolutely come back to this location and specifically ask for Ashley with hopes to see her again.   On top of her perfect customer service the food was beyond expectations. Check them out! You won't be mad.",

    "text": "We used to like going to this place. With the gluten friendly options it was a pretty decent place to eat (aside from the fact they can't seem to find a way to season ground beef without wheat - yet other restaurants do it all the time). However last month we stopped in for dinner and I got the Turkey Club carnita taco (along with the Al pastor taco). The Turkey club taco contains shredded turkey which one would think is safer than eating something like fish that might contain random inedible objects. However I unfortunately chomped down on a rather large piece of BONE after I had eaten 3/4 of the taco. Luckily I didn't swallow it but it didn't feel good on my teeth! I put it on my plate because at first I had no idea what it was. The waitress came by and I showed it to her. She apologized and asked me if I wanted them to make me another taco. Well no - if there are bones in this one, what about others? Plus I had pretty much lost my appetite. So she took my plate away and a few minutes later the manager came by. He explained how the bone possibly could have gotten in there and apologized but didn't even attempt to offer anything to me. No drink, dessert, nothing. So we thought no biggie - most places won't charge you for something like that happening. When the bill came, we noted there was no discount on my meal (I had a BONE in my food people). I've had other restaurants surprisingly give discounts when food came out wrong/late! Now I'm not a person wanting to find fault in restaurants and get stuff for free or discounted but a bone in someone's food that I could have easily swallowed is a big deal to me. So we just paid the bill and left. The next day my fiance called to speak with the corporate office about the issue (since obviously the manager at the restaurant wasn't concerned). He left a message the first time he called. After several days, there was no response so he called again. He spoke with the receptionist who took his name/number and indicated he would get a call back immediately. It's been over 6 weeks and no one ever returned his call. Pretty pathetic customer service and the food isn't that great. We'll never go to Pacos again.",

The tortillas were soft and warm, the salsa perfectly spicy, chips were warm (but a little too salty), guac tastes yummy, and the steak was cooked perfect.   The bads: Chicken taco, drink \"specials\", price, wait, beans, and rice.   The chicken was bland, drinks were over priced and watered down, pricing for two tacos and boxed rice/canned beans is $11 (way too much), watched many tables get turned away but we were seated immediately at an open table, and there were many... I don't understand their seating here it seems strange.   The averages:  Service - somewhat lacking, she was never close by nor did she check on us often enough. I didn't like my drink, and she never asked about the full glass, but happily put the extra $11 on my tab.   The lowdown, this place is okay, not authentic Mexican food, not terrible, but not worth the price. I dunno, we might we return. We might not.",

He was honest and helped us decide on our orders and was very attentive and super funny! CJ alone was enough to get us to come back every week! Everyone else on the staff was great, refilling waters at other tables and bringing out more chips.  I can't say anything negative about this restaurant! The only downside was that we filled up on chips and dip and hardly touched our dinner!!",

The tacos are absolutely wonderful, particularly the beef brisket Paco's and the Wood Grilled Chicken, which come in flavorful orders of two or three. The Chimichanga and Enchiladas are also excellent, and the chips always crisp and delicious.   Every Mexican restaurant lives or dies by its margaritas, and Paco's serves up some of the best in town. My favorite is the El Dorado, now off the menu but still available by request. Service is also friendly and prompt, and the environment is fun and kid-friendly. For my money, Paco's is the best game in town if you're craving Tex-Mex in the Queen City.",

To start out, do yourself a favor and order the volcano queso --- bacon, pineapple, jalapenos all buried inside the cheesy goodness. They serve it with warm tortilla shells so you can switch it up from just plain ole chips.  I've only ever ordered the tacos, and the best go-tos are the Paco's Taco (braised beef brisket FTW) & the Shake Down Shrimp. The Turkey Club & Chicken Milanesa are also good options, but  not nearly as good as my first two recommendations.   Their margs are delicious, albeit a little pricey.

The service was very friendly, lots of smiles which always makes the meal taste a little better in my opinion.   We ordered their drink specials. A rusty el Camino and a peach margarita. Both were lovely. the el Camino was really good.   I ordered the fajitas. the portion was smaller than I expected, but the steak was good. I left full. My wife ordered the tacos al pastor. It wasn't what we expected. But I believe the place is Tex-Mex. The meat was pulled pork. A nod to the geography, I guess. The taste was good, but my wife said she bit into fat a few times which turned her off.   Overall, the place is cool if you are looking for Mexican food in South Park.",

Didn't quite like it and I recommend asking to taste it before you place your order. The light margarita drink was clear and crisp and I don't typically drink light drinks but this was good and tasted way better then the one with the sour mix. Many of the drinks are made with the house sour mix. I got the tacos- chicken and shrimp which were tasty. The rice was stick, but I liked the refried beans I was nice to dip my chips in.

They also have great margaritas and if you get lucky (which is more often than not), you'll get a server who loves tequila and can mix you a cool concoction of their own. Did I mention their sour mix is homemade??",

I tried this place for the first time , after completing a Barre class at a studio within walking distance . I ended up getting a chicken taco bowl ( on the menu it's called a Fiesta Bowl), that was awesome. The fajita chicken was grilled just right, none of that rubbery chicken business. I will definitely be keeping this place in mind the next time I visit the South Park area.",

The reason I give it 4 stars is because we still had to wait an extra 30 minutes for our 8:30 reservation to get seated. The best part was our waiter Jake who took very great care of us. He went through the entire menu with us and took the time explain what is what. It's $30 for a 4 course meals including a margarita so go before it's over. I will definitely be returning.",

I got the Brisket Plate and my husband got the Two taco plate (we shared both meals) with a Taco Al Pastor and a Paco's taco.  The brisket was exactly what I was craving, and we had enough to take home.  Both tacos were good, but the Al Pastor taco was the best out of the two.  We got good service, and great food.

This is my first experience eating brisket (I was told this is the best thing to order at a tex-mex place) and it was delicious!  ....And there is a but....So I am a Northerner and I probably have this wrong so please forgive me....but am I allowed to compare brisket to bbq in the sense that good bbq usually does not have a lot of fat or grisel or bones?  Is brisket supposed to have clumps of fat in it?  If so - and if I am clueless, please forgive the reference to it and skip my review, but if you are the tiniest grossed out by big pieces of fat, dont get the brisket here.  Ok fat conversation over.  Other than that the brisket that I got in my tacos was very tender and delicious.  Yet I was kind of wondering 'where is the rest?'  I gave this place only two stars because the hard-shelled tacos I got had probably three good mouthfuls of brisket and no lettuce or other fillings in them so they pretty much came out 1/3 full for over ten bucks?  (I ordered two tacos but I think you can order 1 or 2 or 3).  No amount of dry Spanish rice on the plate could make up for it.  The meal also came with your choice of beans which were very good.  The pic posted shows the truth of portion size so judge for yourself.    Service was excellent and they were constantly adding chips to the basket on the table.  Sigh...in the end I couldnt get over the fat I had to pick through or that it cost so much for so little.  I hope to try this place in a few weeks and add more stars.",

I had some kind of turkey carnitas taco on a whole wheat tortilla with bacon and avocado on it, DELICIOUS! Top shelf margarita was $10 tonight (Thurs) and well worth it! We will definitely go back!! So nice it is just 3 miles from home too.",

    "text": "Food - 2/2 *I've eaten here multiple times and I've never had anything I don't like.  The tacos (all of them) are excellent.  My favorites are the skirt steak, tanked up and shake down shrimp.  But my personal favorite menu item is the mac and cheese.  It a delightful Texas style mac/cheese that has a kick to it. It's creamy and delicious!  My go-to upscale Tex-Mex restaurant in South Charlotte.  Service - 1/1 *No complaints here.  Friendly, helpful.  Nothing extraordinary, but solid.  Price - 0.5/1 *A little higher than I'd like to pay, but that's what you have to expect in Southpark.  Let's be serious though - $9 for guacamole is outrageous.  Atmosphere - 1/1 *Fun place to have dinner.  Packed on the weekends, but if if's packed, you can still walk around different shops and they'll call you when you table is ready. One night I found a table in the bar area, while it was crowded, and still had a great time.   Listen, all of Frank Scibelli's restaurants (Mama Ricotta's, Cantina 1511, Bad Daddy's Burger Bar, Midwood Smokehouse, and Paco's Tacos & Tequila) are 5/5.  I've come to like this place better than Cantina 1511.  It's the best place to have tacos in the city.",

We were easily able to get seats at the bar at 8:00 PM on a Tuesday.  The bartender was nice enough to create custom margaritas for us and they were DELICIOUS! (but expensive...$11 each!) I definitely recommend getting a margarita with their jalapeno infused tequila.   The salsa was fantastic, but the queso was just OK. Chips were a little undercooked but the staff was great at refilling our basket! My fiance and I shared the combo fajitas (chicken and steak) and it was more than enough food for the two of us. We subbed black beans for the standard charro beans and I was happy we did.  The staff was really friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about their products so I would definitely go back again!",

The chips have the perfect amount of salt. The menu has a lot to choose from. The margaritas are good and the service ranges from okay to good depending on the crowd.  The food isn't the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it's good, it's always good, everything on the menu is good. It's consistent, it's fresh, and the portions are more than you'll need. Chicken burrito is a bit dry but works with salsa. Shrimp tacos are very good, with a decent amount of shrimp. Steak quesadilla is very cheesy (white cheese) and the tortilla has the perfect slight crispness. Food is also quickly prepared.",

I can't believe I've driven by this place so many times, and missed it's existence.  Tucked away in the back corner of the shopping center featuring William Sonoma and Bricktops, you almost have to know it's there or you could miss it.   The service was really friendly, quick, unpretentious, and as soon as we sat down, a bowl of hot crispy chips appeared at our table, with two salsas.    I was THRILLED with my steak and shrimp combo fajitas.  The tortillas are made fresh in house. LOTS of juicy, caramelized peppers and onions, and some kind of butter melted over it for extra decadence. Plenty of toppings and goodies (which is what I love about fajitas!) mean lots of ooey-gooey-drip-down-your-hand-and-arm goodness.   Our server also recommended the Paco's Tacos and shrimp tacos, which were also super flavorful.  The brisket is smoked for 6 hours, and extra tender, perfectly seasoned...the shrimp, breaded and fried, and a bit sweet from the cabbage. If I weren't such a fajita fanatic, I would have downed both tacos.   Notes: Lots of drink specials.  Manager walked around to check up on us several times. Nice dining room area with booths and TV's...another bar area with LOTS of tequila, and another side section of dark polished wood stools...and an outdoor seating area. Next time we have friends in town, this would be a good place to have a gathering.   Bottom Line:  I'm not a connoisseur of Mexican or Tex Mex or whatever Paco Taco is associated with...but it's mighty tasty, and just feels like a comfortable restaurant I'd like to come back to again and again.   PS:  Had the fried ice cream...which is good, but what I liked about it was the marshmallow fluff on the side!",

    "text": "After a shiner beer dinner trip, a few hours at the bar trip, and a few just dinner trips - it's definitely a fully rounded review, but I'm pretty sure it would have sounded the same a few months back.  The food, is delish. The paco's taco (brisket) is just divine, as are both of the shrimp tacos. i think the campechana is awesome - and my mother (a ceviche expert) agreed. They have awesome food specials at the bar, and they have frito pie. (though I have yet to try it, the fact that it is on the menu makes me happy) Even their free chips and (both) salsas don't disappoint. They aren't perfect, and some items I've liked much more than others, but nothing has been \"bad\".  Now to the important part - the booze. a lovely selection of shiner (two or three on tap and then a few bottled) and a (slowly) rotating selection of infused tequilas complete their full bar and tons of tequila. I'm a fan of the three-pepper infused one which tastes fab alone, in a bloody maria, or in their firestarter (or something to the same tune) margarita. oh, their margaritas - I've had a couple different ones and I like all of them, especially the one that's on special that night.   What keeps this from being 5 stars is the service, and maybe a little of the ambiance. The amount of fajita plates ordered is ridiculous, and kind of makes me feel like I'm at Chili's. Not really their fault, I guess, but the constant sizzling and smoking can be distracting. The bartenders have always been great and friendly, but sometimes service has been a miss. In my book, there is a window for great service, but asking if I'm doing okay too many times in a certain time frame can be just as bad as never coming back to check in. I guess at Paco's I'm usually over-served(?), and more than once by a server who reaaaally shouldn't have chugged that second red bull right before her shift started. But hey, my water glass was continually filled to the rim, my drinks kept coming, and seconds after my food hit the window it was at the table - so I can't complain too much.",

The staff was friendly, my waiter was very helpful and although they were busy, they kept things moving and while keeping an eye on everybody. Plus, the food was delicious (had the fish tacos and chips with queso) and also I enjoy the fact you could to a reservation online as well (left my first choice at 830, set appointment online for 9pm, got there and check in at 845pm and by text I was informed two minutes later they had a table) so I was happy my second choice was a superb option.   Now, with this fantastic review you will be wondering why it didn't get the 5 stars and it's only because I was told to removed my hat. Honestly, if I'm there to eat, why does it matter if I have my hat on since it won't be bothering anyone? ***UPDATE*** MANAGEMENT READ MY REVIEW AND CONTACTED ME ABOUT THAT POLICY NOT BEING THE CASE WHICH SHOWS THEIR LEVEL OF GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I THANK THEM FOR CLEARING THAT OUT.

We received a glass of water and then waited. We seen the server buzzing around but evidently we were invisible. Finally she came by and I wanted a margarita. Went for strawberry on the rocks. It was very sweet and hard to explain the taste. Not very good but drinkable. I went for loaded steak tacos. Ok this made up for other things. They were very good and all the toppings were fresh. The guacamole was very good. Service did improve but the evening could have been better.",

No one greeted me, even thought there were plenty of servers walking by. Yes, the rest of the table looked pretty \"done\" but shouldn't the server know that there's a new person here? Say hi, ask if I want anything, pretend you care. When I finally had a server, I asked what is their drink specials, and her response was \"I don't think I can serve you.\"  WHAT??  She offered me a water.  Turned out they have denied service to the entire table because they have a one drink an hour limit. WHAT?? Mind you I was with people who just got off work, including a CFO of the company.  We were not some youngins making troubles. Plus, I just got there, obviously haven't had any drink.  We left shortly after, still baffled. Which restaurant doesn't serve their patrons? I guess one that doesn't want any business.",

The bartender gave me a menu and took my drink order. I opted for the fiesta bowl with grilled shrimp. The fiesta bowl is basically a deconstructed burrito - very similar to the fast casual competition. It was very tasty and the avocado that accompanies the bowl was firm but still ripe - delicious.  The crunch of the cabbage accompanied well with the black beans, three blend cheese, and rice. The shrimp was seasoned well and grilled perfectly.",

The taste of the food is very authentic and we even got to know the fact that this place owner did his research to bring in the beat Mexican food in town. Pretty interesting to me and very relishing to the taste buds.  We preferred to order 3 set crispy chicken and 2 set fish tacos. Each tacos come with a side of rice and another choice of your side. Very tasty! We enjoyed the tacos by gulping our margaritas.  We also had a chance to taste the dessert , the only one which they have - tres leches. It was ok. But , I would definitely recommend the tacos and drinks. Will definitely come back for more Mexican food.",

I loved the soup you could tell the taco strips with in it had been marinating in the broth and the vegetables in it added a nice touch. The only downfall was they completely messed up our order. They bought my boyfriends tacos with the wrong type of tortillas and forgot two of my tacos. They were quick to resolve the issue though.

If you make a reservation, why are you waiting when you're seating walk-ins? That doesn't make sense to me. With four people, it shouldn't be hard to find a spot for us to sit because this place is huge.  With awesome vegetarian options. I was pleased with Paco's except for when they forgot my stuffed jalapeno. I opted for two tacos, one shrimp and the other fish. Shimp was by far the more supperior taco. Just for this taco alone. I will be back. Can't wait for my stuffed jalpeno next time, too.",

    "text": "Jalapeno margarita + kick ass salsa = one happy Nikki.  I have always loved the food here, but the service has pushed this from 4 stars to 5 stars.  Let's begin with research I did a few weeks ago for the Weekly Yelp. For my Yelp Flips The Bird issue, I called on a super busy night. The nice young girl on the phone answered all my odd questions (I never told her who I was or why I was asking all these questions). So nice... so helpful.   This past weekend, I took my buddy Steve to bust his Paco's Tacos cherry. The bartender was our server. She was fantastic. Super friendly, so good at her job. She knew the menu by heart. And when she got tied up with to-go orders at the bar, another nice girl jumped right in to bring us boxes and the check. During the meal, the manager walked over to ask how our lunch was. I wish all restaurants did this. It's such a simple gesture, but it really does go a long way.  Okay now to the food!  Chips and salsa: I love the salsa here. Perfect combination of spice and flavor... plus the chips are so light and fresh. I could easily crush multiple orders by myself.  Firestarter margarita: Jalapeno infused tequila, fresh lime juice and ginger beer. Great heat. The ginger beer gives it a very unique flavor... unlike any other jalapeno margarita I've had.   Paco's Taco: Brisket, caramelized onions and chipotle bbq sauce. The brisket full of flavor and piled high.   Turkey Club Carnitas: slow cooked shredded turkey, sliced avocado, shredded iceberg, jalapeno bacon, tomato and avocado ranch. The Yelp family was right once again. Wow, this is a great taco.  Charro beans: Don't get me wrong, I like black beans.... but I have to go with charro every time for my side.   Fajitas: Nothing beats the smell of the sizzling plate as it comes out... making all other people jealous that they didn't order it. Huge portion size and a giant plate of fresh toppings. This easily made for two meals.   I'm a huge fan of this place... and now so is my buddy Steve. He was super impressed by his first visit.   Cheers Paco's! :)",

First of all, they got rid of the main item that my friends and I enjoyed - the vegetable fajitas! They said it was because they no longer have the ingredients to make them, so they took it off the menu??? THEN the manager proceeded to tell me that my brand new, tiny puppy who was asleep in her blanket the whole time was not allowed on the outdoor patio where we were eating! I was very confused by that as I came here from South Florida and was in NYC before that, have also lived in Europe, and having a dog at the cafe outside isn't even questionable, it's just the norm! The manager told me he would \"make an exception this time\", but wtf? Charlotte itself is outdated in a lot of ways, but this place (and I'm sure plenty of others in Charlotte), need to get with the spirit of 2018!",

I always say i'm going to try something different but I very rarely do because I love their tacos so much.the signature Paco's Taco is amazing and when doing the combo, you never finish the whole thing but yay for leftovers!.  table side Guac -- you know it's fresh. you never run out of chips! I do have to say my favorite Margarita out of the ones they have as their signature cocktails is the Rusty El Camino.   i love the smoked Jalapenos, yes it's spicy but i'm used to it being half puerto rican. Its fun to watch my boyfriend eat them and after 3 bites, there is sweat dripping down his face! He's a good sport though. But how can you resist anything wrapped in bacon!  We go there a lot. It's a lot of food for a decent price..... best part... lunch the next day or if it's friday or saturday, try putting the leftovers in an omelet! So good!   AND MOST OF ALL FOR ME-- A GLUTEN FREE MENU as I have Celiac disease. everything for me is on a corn tortilla!",

The Paco Taco was bomb and be sure to get the Charro beans - so good! $2 pint of Shiner doesn't hurt their case either.  True Tex-Mex taco shop with all the random Texas decor on the walls.

Chips and salsa are complimentary, but try to avoid filling up on them before the food comes! Service is generally good and the quality of the food matches the price. Parking is self Park, no valet.

Yea, we'll go with that.  We were immediately given plates, chips and salsas, and had our drink order taken (Their margaritas are the bomb, make sure to ask for their daily special, ours were the No Name for $5). After multiple visits getting their wonderful tacos, I ventured to order the Fiesta Bowl, which was basically a 'skinny' burrito with cabbage instead of lettuce (which was really great!).  I don't think I've reviewed here before, so please don't get me wrong, the tacos are AWESOME. But it felt good to try something new.  ... And now I can say I've done it and I don't have to do it again and I can back to tacos thankyouverymuch.  Always good service. Always good food. Always leftovers. How can you go wrong?",

    "text": "Stopped by this place as we were heading out of town from a business trip. It was a southwestern type authentic Mexican food restaurant. We both had tacos. I had the skirt steak taco and husband had skirt steak taco and their Paco taco. Lots of choices for different types of tortillas and beans. Both plates of food came with choice of beans. We tried the retried and black beans which were both good as well as their rice. It was too early for margaritas as it was on a Sunday and NC law requires you wait till 12 to drink. NC residents should vote that law away- lol. Great place for Mexican food. Service excellent.",

I'm not a fan of food made spicy for the sake of being hot.  Both of the salsas and the queso had a spicy flavor without being hot.  One of the highlights was the three Shiner beers on tap: Bock, 102, and the Ruby Red.  All fresh and cold, and only $5 for 20 oz.  We had two entrees: the barbacoa special and the enchiladas.  I've never had better.  Usually enchiladas are just a mess of cheese and a sauce.  These were flavorful and bite after bite you could taste the distinctive flavors.",

    "text": "We went to Paco's Tacos & Tequila this past Saturday night for a late dinner (around 9:00).  It was still pretty crowded, which is impressive considering there's very little signage leading you back to this new restaurant that sits hidden in the back of a parking lot.  I guess word-of-mouth does wonders!    We were impressed by the transformation from the former Manzetti's to Paco's.  The new decor added to Manzetti's dark wood was perfectly suited for a Tex-Mex place.    A friend of mine had been recently and recommended (since I like spicy food) the jalapeno margarita.  (I think it was called the \"Firestarter\" on the menu?)  I ordered it, and it was fantastic.  There were other jalapeno-infused beverages offered that sounded appealing, too.  Mind you, these are ONLY for people who are serious about spicy food; they're damn hot.  Be sure to order a glass of water as an accompaniment!  The chips and salsa they serve (free!) to start were fantastic.  The chips were very light -- both in weight and taste.  I didn't feel like I was truly stuffing myself with them (which was a good thing!).  There were two types of salsa served with it -- a sweet green tomatillo one and a red spicy one (possibly habanero?).  Both tasted incredibly fresh and flavorful.    As an additional app (because it was late, we were starving, and they sounded so good), we ordered the fried pickle chips and jalapenos.  It was the perfect combination for sharing between spicy food lovers and non-spicy food lovers.   I ordered two tacos for my entree -- a fish taco and a shrimp taco.  The fish was just okay. I think it's the coleslaw that ruins it for me; I'm not a fan of cabbage.  The BBQ shrimp taco was awesome, though.  I think next time I would order a quesadilla like my partner had, since I don't really need the rice and beans.  The quesadilla was huge, packed full, and came with fresh-made pico de gallo and guacamole (with chunks of avocado in it).      Would I recommend Paco's?  Heck yeah.  For many reasons.  It's a great casual dining experience, offers drinks and salsas that other Mexican restaurants don't, and it's fun for all.",

It's in a great South Park location where Manzetti's used to be.  They started us off with chips and dip which included a warm basket of chips, hot salsa as in heated not spicy hot, and a side of pureed guac.  Everyone liked the warm salsa and guac.  For apps we had the Brisket Nachos and Bottle Caps which were a combination of deep fried pickles and jalapenos with chipolte sauce...tasty!  The nachos consisted of about 10 nachos each with a piece of brisket on top with cheese etc.  Both apps were good and priced in the $8-10 range each.  The apps portion sizes weren't huge but eveyone was able to get a taste of each.  For entrees we had the Ambushed Shrimp and Brisket Tacos.  The 9 shrimp were bacon wrapped with a cheese topping.  The entree came with slaw and rice for $18.  A tad pricey but very good!  The brisket tacos are avaiable in hard or soft shell with rice, beans, and slaw and received a thumbs up.  The tacos are approx $12.    For dessert we had one Tres Leches for the whole table.  I must say it was some of the best I've ever had.  They brought out our bill for 4 which also included 8 Dos Equis beers for a total of $122 not including tip.  Our friend took care of the bill but we left a nice tip for our great waiter.  We collectively gave it 3 stars due to the upper end pricing for tex-mex but if your looking for something a little different it's definitely worth a try :)!",

It was very uncomfortable as it was humid and there was a stench coming from somewhere? They brought us around to the back side in front of the window. That was great. But it was evident that we weren't going to get served anytime soon. Our waitress went to every table around us, including a couple that was seated 5 minutes after us???? I was calm as I wanted to have a nice evening. But I really wanted to get up and leave after 15 minutes! When her mood ring changed the right color for her to serve our table, I ordered a strawberry rita on the rocks. Way to sweet. Move on to the Dennis enchiladas. Those made everything better. They had a creamy cheese sauce on top, instead of a lump of hard melted plastic. Very good and filing.

Margarita was well blended and tequila options were impressive.   Wait staff was impressive!   How Chuys stays in business so close to this place is impossible to understand,",

The Paco Taco which has a slowed cooked chili-rubbed brisket in it. Unbelievably good. An amazing fish taco, the best I've ever had, which unfortunately will not be offered on the restaurants new menu. Too bad because it was delicious. The last taco had skirt steak in it. It too was great but the Paco Taco was even better. The platter had rice, a slaw with amazing fresh ingredients like corn sliced right off the cob, and awesome Charro beans. Everything was hot and seemed incredibly fresh. $2 Shiner Bock drafts on Thursdays was a plus. This is now my go to place when I spend the night in Charlotte.",

They are a must-get.  I had an interesting cocktail called firestarter or firebreather or something.  Its primary ingredient is jalepeno infused tequila.  It was pretty cool.  It astounds me that a drink has been created that is spicy and sour at the same time.  I don't know how good it is for business though because it prompted me to sip slowly.  There was a 30 min or so wait on prime time Sat night, but service was good and price was reasonable.  2 brisket tacos with rice, beans and chipotle slaw for $10!",

After writing my original review, I was contacted by \"Stephanie\" with FS Food Group (Big Daddy's Burger Bar, Mama Ricotta's, Plate Perfect Catering, Cantina 1511, and Paco's Tacos & Tequila).  She apologized for the error with  the $8 split plate fee and asked for a copy of our receipt to clear up the mistake.  To make a long story short, we were charged only $2 for the split plate but they did inadvertently charge us for the dinner portion vs. the lunch portion of fajitas.  Next thing you know, I open my mailbox and guess what's there???  A gift certificate with a handwritten thank you note appreciating my help!  I love a business that \"gets\" customer service!  Nice job FS Food Group.  I'm a fan.",

    "text": "On a warm summer afternoon, there are only a few things that are more soul satisfying than chips and salsa, chicken fajitas and an ice cold margarita! This restaurant rightfully has \"tequila\" in their name, because they make one sick firecracker margarita!! Made with jalapeno infused tequila and lime juice, it's one of the most refreshing drinks I've had... with a kick!! (I think I may have finally found my favorite beverage.) For those of you who aren't afraid of spicy foods and drinks, this is definitely something you ought to try! Enough about the margarita! Now moving on to the food... I ordered a pretty standard dish; the chicken fajitas. This is usually my first choice in Mexican restaurants, because it's a safe choice, and usually sets the expectation for how good the other items on their menu might be; it's a good benchmark for me. Given that the fajitas were quite good, I'm definitely going back to try some of the more interesting items on their menu like the chimichangas and bbq shrimp tacos! Mmmm... I'm already looking forward to another glass (or two) of the Firecracker Margarita! =)",

We arrived about 515pm, the place was dead, and it took a solid 20 minutes to get our drinks and chips/salsa. There were 5 in our party, all of us had cocktails.  Anyone who thinks the guacamole is good has never been to an authentic restaurant. It is a novel idea to have it made at your table, but it has zero taste.  Our server was rude, slow and snapped her fingers when we needed water refills. Our chip bowl was always empty and any request from extra napkins to a cocktail re-order seemed to be a huge inconvenience to our server.  The queso dip was good, but at 9 dollars, way overpriced.  I ordered the 3 taco meal; the turkey and bacon taco was verry salty, and I LOVE salt; the beef taco and chicken taco were ok and you could tell the entire meal had been sitting under a heat lamp for 20 minutes. The refried beans were delish and the highlight of my dining entire experience.  The beans, fresh drinks (although pricey) and location get it 2 stars. I doubt I will go back.",

    "text": "After having heard many great things about Paco's, we were very excited to try it. Since moving to Charlotte from Texas several years ago, we have not found a True Tex-Mex place that comes close to the real thing. Paco's comes close, but it's got way too much \"Carolina flavor\" thrown in to truly call it Tex-Mex, or even Mexican, for that matter.  We went on a Friday night. Made an Open Table reservation through Yelp on the same day - super easy and convenient. When we arrived, we were seated right away at a nice window table. My 8-year old was thrilled with the kids' menu/crayon combo, and my hubby and I ordered margaritas and some guacamole to get settled in.  We made the mistake of ordering the Cadillac Margaritas, which were bright blue and way too sweet (they were on special, so we thought we'd try it). Their traditional margarita on the rocks was MUCH better!  Hands down, the BEST part of the meal was the table-side guacamole. Our waiter was enthusiastic about this, and it did not disappoint. He mixed up the guac to our specifications (chunky or smooth? spicy or not spicy?). It was perfectly seasoned and yummy to the last bite. I would go back JUST for the guacamole, it was that good.  Entrees: I am a fish taco fanatic, so I had to order the fish taco. I also got the brisket taco, upon recommendation by our waiter. My hubby ordered the steak burrito. Our son ordered the cheese quesadilla. The food arrived quickly, and was fresh and hot upon the drop. My husband loved his burrito. It was huge! The steak was tender and nicely seasoned. The burrito had a sour cream queso on top, not my hubby's cuppa tea, but he poured some of their house made salsa over it and was happy. My fish taco was supremely good - from the homemade flour tortillas to the crunchy, slightly spicy fried fish (you can also order grilled fish) and creamy slaw topping. I was very happy with this item.  The brisket taco was... weird. As I mentioned, I moved here from Texas where brisket is king. So I had pretty high expectations of the brisket. I was surprised to taste something sweet in my brisket, and it was NOT a pleasant surprise. There were caramelized onions in it, and a chipotle BBQ sauce, which made the whole experience overly sticky-sweet and ruined the brisket, in my opinion. I realize that here in the Carolinas, this sort of sweetness in a savory dish is popular, so I figured the chef wanted to appeal to the regional tastebuds. I wouldn't order the brisket taco again, though. But that's because there are several other items on the menu I plan to try! My son's cheese quesadilla was as expected - my little picky eater was pleased and happily gobbled it up.  Dessert: We were stuffed, but we ordered a Tres Leches cake to go. It was perfection, even a day later after sitting in a plastic container overnight. I highly recommend you try this dessert! It's the real deal. The peanut butter chocolate pie was tempting, too.   Service and aesthetic were both excellent. The tables were a little close, and the restaurant was somewhat noisy, but that only adds to the experience.   All in all, while we did not find \"the one\" we've been in search of, but we were pleased and will return. My husband still favors Cantina 1511 over Paco's, but I would have to say the guacamole was so good that I would go to Paco's over Cantina any day of the week. : )  If you're in the SouthPark area, and craving Mexican, you won't be disappointed in Paco's. Just be sure to read the product descriptions so you're not surprised when your food/drinks arrive!",

A female manager jad gathered servers in the kitchen and started yelling and cursing about something. My children even remarked about the \"bad words\" she used. Normally I would brush this off as maybe a bad day but it was the second time I noticed this. My previous visit an older gentlemen yelled about dirty tables. I think asking for help will get you further rhan berating employees. Your servers are most likely hard working and under paid as it is. I refuse to support an establishment that treats employees that way. It's unfortunate.  I feel horrible for your staff.  There are better ways to communicate issues and more effective means of dealing with problems besides yelling and cursing.",

Everything including the chips (homemade), salsa, cocktails, guacamole, salad (we had the chopped and a split portion was still gigantic) and tacos (the smoked brisket ones were fabulous) was excellent.

We started with the queso blaco which was very good.. creamy and had peppers in it which was a nice touch. For dinner I opted for the small chopped salad, BF ordered the two taco place with crunchy beef and soft brisket (for me!) with charro beans as the sside. The small chopped salad was HUGE... I had enough for the next day, nice and fresh with lots of veggies and chick peas (love them!). The ground beef was well seasoned and nice and juicy.. the brisket was a little salty, I will say we do not use a lot of salt so I would guess its at a \"normal\" restaurant food level... it was very tender and flavorful. BF said the charro beans were really good but I was too stuffed to try~",

Second time I've ate at Paco's and I must say, they live up to the great reviews and I'm not even a Mexican food kinda guy, but sweet fancy moses they have great tacos. Not like your ordinary cheap tacos - these are well made with great ingredients. Always...I mean ALWAYS order the Unholy Guacamole - they make it in front of your and it is delisioso...I believe that is Spanish for tasty. The girls digg the margaritas too and I'll always toss back a Corona while I'm at it. Gracious once again Paco.",

I only saw four tables from where I was sitting (right behind the host stand), which were full. Other than that, I am certainly coming back.",

    "text": "I'm seriously torn about how to review - as two stars or three.  This would have been four had it not been for the shortcut to an unplanned weight loss.  Business traveler, dining alone, weekday night.  Fairly busy. Sat in bar area at high top.  Prompt service.  Asked for and promptly received water, chips, salsa.  Salsa tasted great and had a good amount of heat.  Waiter made a few recommendations, including the pork carnitas.  Carnitas are always risky - I've had way too chewy and overcooked, I've had ok but stomach ache for a week and I've had \"damn, I should order that every time\" - but all from different establishments.  It was really feeling like more of a fish taco night so I compromised and ordered the Tuna Carnitas.  Sounded interesting and tasty!  Waiter came back and apologized saying they are taking it off the menu.  Hmmm.  I decided to not pursue the seafood angle based on that so rather than fish tacos instead went with waiter's original recomendation of Pork Carnitas - he reaffirmed my confidence in my selection by saying \"Now that's a great choice!\"  So I felt good about it.  And I have to say, they tasted excellent!!  Only, as I was walking to my car after having had a good amount of salsa and the carnitas (didn't really eat the beans which came with it) I felt the first \"uh-oh\" moment.  My hotel was literally only minutes away so I kept going.  That almost did not work out...within about 20 seconds of walking in my hotel room door I think I had literally lost 5 lbs.  My stomach is not that sensitive but this must have been caused by something I just ate to have had such a quick and unpleasant reaction.  On the positive side, thanks to the \"cleanse\", my suit pants weren't too snug the next day and I gave an unbelievable presentation to my client!  So 3 stars.",

    "text": "This review is based solely on food and experience. I did not get to partake of any tequilas or margaritas, but I was not looking to drink alcohol on this lunch occassion.  To start with, we ordered some chili con queso. Our server then prompted us, \"do you want the white queso, or the chili con queso?\". Only the chili con queso is listed in the menu, so I had to ask about the white queso. $5 gets you a small bowl of Velveeta product with some rotel in it. Something you can easily make at home.   For lunch we ordered a chicken quesadilla (for my partner) and I ordered the chopped salad. Once again, we were prompted with an option that is not listed in the menu- \"would you like the small salad, or the large salad?\" Our server had a hard time explaining the difference in size, but eventually she got it out. I'm glad I got the small size, but if you want the small size and you want to add chicken to it like I did, be prepared for a $11 salad. The dressing was tossed in with the salad, but I wish I'd asked for it on the side, because I was underwhelmed with the overall flavor of the salad as a whole. The chicken appeared to be pounded out flat, and was dry. Nothing special here.  While we were waiting on our food, I took a look around at some other plates...Now, I get that the tacos are what they're known for, but $11 for two tacos is just absurd in my mind. I am a taco afficianado, and the ones that i saw on other plates just didn't look all that great. Best way to serve a taco is simply corn tortilla, meat, onions, and cilantro. Authentic, and less than $2 at a True mexican restaurant. I get that it's tex mex, but if you're out for authenticity, Paco's Taco's is not the place to go. Venture on to South Blvd, or Eastway if you want the real deal.... you could feed four people for the price of two here.",

Regardless, I really like this place. It is in a great location tucked behind South Park Mall so people from all areas south of 277 can get to it with ease. I don't really tend to notice ambiance unless it is for a date or there is something special. However, there is something (which I can't put my finger on) that personally put me at ease here. The food is mid-range priced Tex-Mex but high quality taste. Even the chips are noticibly better than other Tex-Mex restaurants. The complimentary salsa has a bit more kick than most. It is tasty but be forewarned. I tend to always end up gravitating to the tacos and depending on appetite, and how many free chips I've consumed, I can order two or three (I can always take home that third). They have some pretty unique taco options and what is great is that you can mix and match. I have not tried a bad one yet. Although I am still working my way down the menu ;-) Also, if you are here with your friends, be festive and grab one of their signature margaritas. They are delicious!",

No worries - you can put your name on the list and grab a seat at the bar while you wait to be called.  Oddly enough, when I asked for one of the buzzers to notify me when our table was ready, I was told that its range was really bad and it might not go off, even though the bar was 6 feet away.  Luckily, the anticipated 45-50 minute wait was cut to only ~30 minutes, and we grabbed the pitcher of blood orange margaritas to drink at our table.     While our server and service was fine, I unfortunately found the food to be unremarkable, with the free chips & salsa being the best thing all night (although Ben mentions the tomatillo salsa, we only received the smokey red one).   We started with the table side guacamole, and while it was heartily devoured, it lacked much heat or flavor outside fresh avocado.  I ordered three tacos and tried the chicken, skirt steak, and ground beef options.  On the plus side, with three tacos, rice, and my choice of charro, refried, or black beans, there was more than enough food; on the con side, none of it was overly remarkable... in fact, there wasn't much to remember on any part of my plate.    Of all the Frank Scibelli's restaurants, Paco's proves to be my least favorite.  I've tried it twice and have been underwhelmed both times.  Maybe third time's the charm, but with all the other great eateries around town, I don't know if I'll give Paco's a final chance to wow.",

Cola has been sitting on the bar watered down and has not been refreshed....DONT come here if your hungry and want good food.",

Wish I hadn't! Only thing good was chips and salsa served before the meal. If you like bland, tasteless, flavor deficient, Americanized Mexican food you'll probably like this food. I however can count at least 5 maybe 6 Mexican food restaurants around Charlotte better than this place. (Verde, Vida, El Paraiso, Que Onda, Pio Pio, On The Border) Besides the flavor deficient food, the furnishings were old and dirty, whole place needs a good cleaning. Waitress didn't listen to my order very well, and brought me something I didn't order. So that was a wasted $50. Never again will they get my money. I was sadly disappointed!",

Great price/value for what you get. Chicken was grilled, but lacked \"authentic\" marinated flavor. Still very good. The borracho beans were spot on! The tortillas, I doubt are made from scratch on premise as they seemed too formed and thick like pita bread. Just an opinion - again, good.  Overall, great experience.",

    "text": "I was visiting Charlotte from Jacksonville Fl to see my sister and her family..just before this I was reading a list of the top tacos in America..because i love tacos, this doesnt seem like something strange to read for me..well i told my sister that while i was in town i must eat at Pacos, cause they have the number four tacos in the US, also the name is super fun to say and the menu made me drool a little! We got there around 2 o clock in the afternoon on New Years Eve and only waited a few moments before we were shown to our table..the energy here is really awesome, and theres a bright bar showcasing all the libations available..we were brought some chips and salsa right away and then met our server David (last name Pacheco..theres more than one David here) he was super quick and attentive and was able to answer questions for me with no hesitation or giving me a really long winded non answer..i learned that the salsa is made in house, and he also was able to direct me to a fabulous local IPA, that of  course I cant remember the name of..soon we were placing orders that all consisted of tacos..and also some table side guacamole..the guac was so good..and im really picky about guac..my sister and nephew really liked it as well..then our meals came, and everything looked oh so fantastic..i got a soft shake down shrimp which had crispy plump shrimp and some shredded cabbage, pico de gallo and chipotle ranch..i also had a soft smokey and the brisket (cute name!) it had the most tender amazing brisket and some pico de gallo..they were both amazing and flavorful..the pico de gallo and chipotle ranch really take things to a whole different taste level..also with the tacos come rice and beans (i chose refried, you can get charro or black) and i pointed out to my nephew that by looking at the crisp brown cheese on top of the beans you can tell they werent just heated up in a microwave..also the rice was really on point as well..normally the rice and beans are kind of just meh when you get them as part of a meal, this was so good i ate it all! We were checked on and got drink refills very often, and we really enjoyed all the food we had..price point was really good for the type of quality that it is..I will try to head here when I am in town next!!",

    "text": "I visited Paco's for the first time during Restaurant Week along with a lot of others! My friend made 7:00 p.m. reservations on a Tuesday night and the place was packed! The only sour note was that, even with reservations made, we still had to wait around 15 minutes to be seated. However, it was worth the wait....  The restaurant week menu offered A LOT of food plus a margarita for $30/person. The drink special was the No Name margarita (very good!) with offering of four other courses. First course was choice of queso (beef, white, or yellow) - my table ordered each one since there were three of us. ALL GOOD!  Second course offered choice of pork nachos or guacamole. Two of us ordered the guac, which is prepared table-side with choice of it being smooth/creamy or chunky and level of spice. I asked for chunky guac and for it to be made 'medium' but I didn't really taste much spice.  Third course was choice of tacos, various enchiladas, or fajitas. I went for the three tacos (get choice of tortilla): Shrimp, fish, and turkey club tacos. The shrimp taco was my favorite with choice of beans and rice.  For dessert, choice of tres leches cake or brownies with strawberries. I went for the brownies.  With all of the choices offered, you would think the portion sizes would suffer but they did not. Everything was delicious and generously sized. There was no way I could finish everything so I had my remaining guac (which I was able to snack on for three extra days) and tacos packed up to go.  I will DEFINITELY be going back to Paco's because I think I've found a new favorite Mexican spot.",

While we were waiting for a table, my coworkers and I grabbed a drink at the bar and they brought their chips and salsa right out to us too. Now this isn't just the normal salsa you get at every other Mexican restaurant, this salsa had a kick to it and it was so good. When we got seated at a table and again the chips and salsa came right out with no hesitation. Our server came over and she was was very friendly and gave great recommendations. Starting off we ordered the volcano queso with no pineapples and it was absolutely delicious with chopped up bacon on top. I want that recipe haha Everything on the menu looked great but I ended up going for the chimichanga and my friends went for 3 tacos each. The food portions are outrageous and I love it. I wasn't able to finish my food but really wished I could. My friends also couldn't finish and could really only eat 2 tacos.  We saw on the menu brussel sprouts and bacon and we were sold, but unfortunately we weren't impressed at all. This is a dish that is best left simple. We would suggest not shredding the brussel sprouts and maybe keeping them whole or cutting them in half. It turned more so like a slaw with the shredding and the tomatoes and we wished it wasn't.  Overall, this place is amazing! I would suggest it to everyone. Though we didn't like the brussel sprouts, everything else was to die for and this place definitely deserves a 5.",

    "text": "The first time I came here was with my fiance and dad for Fathers Day. We didn't have reservations, but there wasn't a wait and we were seated right away. My dad ordered steak fajitas and my fiance and I ordered the chicken and steak fajita combo. Everything was really good and the portions were huge! None of us finished everything - even me and my fiance and we were splitting. The prices are a little high but the food was good.  The second time I came was for Valentines Day. My fiance made a reservation, but we were about 30 minutes early and they were still able to seat us right away. We wanted the fajitas and decided to split again since the portions are so large. However this time we were charged a splitting fee for sharing food. Even though it wasn't a big fee - I was pretty disappointed with this. Our waitress didn't tell us this beforehand - I only knew prior to receiving the check because I overheard another waiter tell his table. Typically when going out my fiance and I share appetizers and one entree so we don't over order food and get to try more - so I always hate when restaurants want to charge you for sharing food. The food was good. The amount of vegetables definitely increased, while the amount of meat included decreased. I ordered the Perfect Pear Punch off their cocktail menu. It was good, but you couldn't really taste the apple cider in it and for $12 I wasn't very impressed.  Overall I like it here. The food is good, the staff is nice, and the atmosphere is unique. If you really like tequila or margaritas they have a pretty extensive drink list.",

Thanks to my Yelp friends, I heard that Paco's was THE PLACE, so I put out feelers for someone to come with me. No takers. I'm still new to Charlotte and I don't have friends...is this starting to sound like a dating site profile?!?!   Anyway, I decided to take my damn self out for tacos. It was crowded when I arrived but I quickly found a spot at the bar. I guess being a party of one isn't so bad. I was quickly acknowledged, given a menu and asked for my drink order. A tray of shots sat in front of me begging to be sampled. Eventually one of the young ladies came to pick it up and offered me one. It was a STRONG coconut margarita! It was good...and it paired nicely with the pineapple mint margarita...I had two of those, and they were so worth it. The chips and salsa were great. The salsa was nice and spicy! I decided to get the three tacos (two shrimp and one white fish) with rice and double order of slaw instead of the beans. Because...CARBS!  I would really love to come back and try the nachos and a salad, and queso, and...Yeah, the entire menu.",

    "text": "Disclaimer, I like simple food.  Paco's like many restaurants have gone to the practice of just adding more toppings on something that is already delicious simply to drive up the cost.  I suspect a lot of times this is because they know people will ask to leave off items to restore it to the delicious item it was.  Paco's like to throw chipotle, avocado, and other items on simple things.  I found myself paying full price while asking to leave half of the items off so I could just have simple food...and when I did that I found the simple things like the tortilla, meat, and pico probably needed the avocado, chipotle ranch and the other items I left off to make it good.  Again, I am a simple food guy so this might be the best place for foodies.",

Every meal starts with the chips, which most of the time are hot and fresh. They're free and come with salsa that is mild and a bit smoky. That's good on it's own, or you can get queso (my fav queso) or tableside guac.   For the main course I tend to rotate between various tacos, fajitas, or the top big taco salad. Never ordered anything I didn't like.   This place is also awesome for margs. The regular marg does you just fine, but if you're picky about your tequila, they've got so many options! They also tend to do seasonal ones and my fav so far has been a watermelon one.   If you get a chance to go during restaurant week, do it! It's a ton of food for the value. Everything listed above and maybe even a little more, all for $30 per person.",

There was a super short wait. The place was packed! I have never seen a restaurant turn over and clean tables so efficiently and well. It made my previous server heart happy!   We were seated quickly and instantly greeted by our server, Roger. He was super attentive and personable. Having been our first time here, he was also helpful in making some taco suggestions.   We ordered the chili con queso dip. It came out fairly quickly and was so delicious. It was flavorful and creamy. Their salsa is amazing. Smokey and a but spicy. Loved it!  I ordered two tacos, steak and the shrimp. It comes with red rice, coleslaw and your choice of beans. It opted for black beans. I also put those tacos in a corn tortilla. My hubby ordered the chicken enchiladas and our kiddo ordered the chopped salad.   My tacos were outstanding. My eyes were bigger than my tummy and I ended up bringing my steak taco home. I just couldn't power through. The shrimp taco was so delicious. Lots of flavor and a little bit of heat. Absolutely outstanding. My hubby and kiddo equally enjoyed their food.   I wish we had a Paco's where I live. I would eat there about every day. There were still several tacos I would love to try. Definitely will back!",

First of all, I loved the chips, salsa, and guacamole here.  The guac is made at the table with your choice of typical ingredients and also your choice of consistency.  So my chuncky/spicy guac preference was definitely satsified.  I ordered three tacos, the best of which was probably the shrimp or shredded beef (i forget the exact name).  All you really need for a good street taco is well-seasoned meat, a unique topping (think cabbage or some other veggie), and a good sauce.  Paco's does all of these well and puts it on par with some of the great street taco-style mexican restaurants I frequent in Cincinnati.  As a side, the black beans were awesome.  I'd love to visit PAco's again to try the tequila selection, other tacos, or some of the other menu sections I didn't experience.",

Seriously it tastes like dried ghost chilis, reconstituted with vinegar and mixed with honey - there is probably more to it than that but it doesn't matter - all you need to know is this stuff packs some heat.  Seriously, go light on it if you are not used to very spicy food.  Also the carnitas have become my new favorite, I'm quite certain they are some of the best in town.

The food is always amazing (I have never had one bad item), the service is good, and we enjoy the music selection.   Since I come here so often one of my friends gave me a gift card to here for my birthday (she knows me well). That next Sunday we put it to use only to find that the money she put on it did not register on the gift card. The manager came over to let us know this and was very apologetic. I spoke to my friend in regards to the amount that was on the card and the manager put that amount on the card and more for our troubles, no questions asked. The customer service she provided went above and beyond what she needed to do. We thought we loved Pacos before but now we know this is the best place in Charlotte.   Since this is my favorite place I will also give some recommendations on the food I love here: Veggie fajitas, enchiladas de dennis (I usually see if I can get it with ground beef instead of chicken), the beef chimichanga (we get this with queso over the whole things instead of the half and half sauce), chopped salad is amazing as well as the chicken tortilla soup, the guacamole is made fresh at the table, the queso is amazing, the tacos are amazing I love the pacos taco, gringo beef, wood grilled skirt steak, and we love the BBQ buttered Corn.   Again I cannot recommend Pacos enough, thank you for showing quality customer service and the best Mexican food in town.",

I recently discovered that going during the week is easy on the pocket book.  :)  They have half price bottles of vino on Wednesdays...which again...Hubs was thrilled.  LOL!  He enjoys beer specials and I light up when there are wine specials.  We sat out on the patio and chatted with the waitress which was nice.  She was friendly and just laid back.  We weren't in any hurry...enjoying the cool night air while we sipped on our 1/2 price bottle.  The fresh Quac is my fav (nothing like what i make though.  *wink*) but it's fresh and oh so good.  Fish tacos are decent...chips and salsa are yummy.  All three times we've been here, the GM has come out to either greet us or bring us our chips.  So crazy, yet refreshing.  He's extremly nice.   Can't wait to go back....this place will def be on the rotation list! Plus it's close to me casa just in case....hehehe!",

The sides are strong but not outstanding black bean, slaw and rice are nice but again not outstanding but sides shouldn't steal the thunder anyhow. Staff was friendly and efficient without being over attentive. All in all a good experience it would have received 5 stars but as is common in Taco spots the temperature of the food was a bit on the chilly side.",

Cool place, insanely popular, plan on waiting a bit (we went and poked around some nearby shops for a few).  When I time came we were promptly seated and delivered chips and salsa, which were delicious. Definitely dig that salsa!  We ordered 4 different tacos, ground beef, pork, chicken, and steak. The chicken was tasty, the pork with pineapple salsa was awesome, the steak was dry and chewy, and the ground beef tasted like dry beef jerky.  I could eat tons of the Mexican rice, that and he salsa were my favorite parts of the meal.  Honorable mention for the fresh made tortillas, the flour tortilla was especially tasty!  A little bummed overall, we were hoping the tacos were going to be bangin' but they left us wanting to look elsewhere to fill that gaping taco shaped hole in our hearts.",

People leave the most asinine complaints sometimes clearly outright falsified reviews and the business just needs to sit there and take it.  Scroll down and read Adam J's review where he complains about bland meat. This man is clearly an idiot and his opinion is dumb. Empty tables dont mean shit buddy, you need to have a waitress available to serve you too. I hope that you dont go back to Pacos Tacos because you dont deserve to eat there.",

Salad had a bunch of delicious toppings such as corn, avocado, tomato, jicama, garbanzo beans, queso fresco.   Service is always spot on and food never disappoints. I live much further away now in the Waxhaw area and don't get to have Paco's often anymore. You should definitely put one in Indian Land or Ballantyne!",

The service is typically super friendly. I have only had 1 experience where the service was not good but she could've been having a rough day.   I've eaten at over a hundred Mexican restaurants and the (free) chips & salsa here is unparalleled. This is such a small feature but so important.   I've eaten the shake down shrimp tacos, brisket enchiladas, taco salad, al pastor tacos, brisket tacos.... I feel like I'm forgetting so much! But everything has been incredible!   I visit at least twice a week & will continue to. I'm always so impressed with this place!! Please give it a chance!!!",

The menu is varied, but not too overwhelming, and the cocktails are plentiful. I had the strawberry and the pineapple margaritas, both were mixed well and were super enjoyable with lunch. The table split the salsa and chips plus guacamole; the salsa was sooo yummy, I wish I had asked to buy a jar! The guacamole was made at the table and super fresh.  For lunch I went with the 2 tacos plate-they were huge, tons of flavor and lots of different options-plus it came with slaw, rice and beans. It was truly a ton of food haha All of it was super yummy and I would definitely go back again!",

The chicken quesadilla was also good, you can't really mess that up.  Overall, this is a popular place with the locals and I can see why.",

I usually go for the two taco combo, but today I went for the denis enchilada, and it might be my new favorite. It's filled with chicken and spinach, and then smothered in their queso and this red pepper cream. It's warm, a little spicy and a happy enchilada hug! They serve their plates with a side of rice and beans of your choice. The retried beans are great, but the rice is a give away, in my opinion. Nothing too exciting or flavorful about it.   They have a full bar, and with that many margarita choices....and you can't go wrong with any of them. It's a perfect compliment to the free chips and salsa that come with your meal as well!",

We sat outside and I ordered a strawberry margarita which was tasty and not too 'tequila' flavored. We ordered fish, beef, and chicken tacos that were all excellent. In addition to our meal, we scarfed down some chips, salsa, and white queso. Our waiter was witty and quick with service. Many of the staff came to bring us our food and clear our plates. The only criticism I would give is that our beans weren't very good. But who cares about the beans when there's tacos and tequila!!!",

The dish was good in it self however, was not able to eat much as the brisket was very fatty. When I told the server about the brisket she offered to replace my meal or bring me a helping of brisket that was more lean... She brought me a nice serving size and a \"To Go\" bowl. In my opinion, it's all about how you solve a problem.  I wouldn't steer any one away. I just didn't like my meal. The overall atmosphere was friendly and attentive.  Post script: We had originally planned to go to the Pink Cactus but, changed our plans after reading the bad reviews (and lack of response to those by management).",

We arrived on a Friday night around 5 pm for dinner for 2 people and it was a 30 minutes wait. However, there were some openings at the bar so she just snagged some bar stools.   House margaritas $8 in a fariflu large glass. The Friday drink special was top shelf tequila in the margarita for $10 (sry cant remember the type)  Complimentary, unlimited chips and salsa which was delicious and mild. If you want queso or guac it's $10 ouch.    My boyfriend selected the 3 taco combo for $13.50 he had chicken, shrimp and battered fried fish. Accompanied with rice and your choice of beans. Really big tacos for the prices. They loaded them up! The fish taco was just out of this world.   I had a small chop salad for only $7 I wasn't entirely that hungry. It was good nothing really WOW but I indeed ate it all.   Loved this place, your clothes and hair will smell upon leaving FYI!   We will definitely be back, Until next time, Tara B.",

We put our name in and had to wait about 15 minutes for our table but that was no problem. We sat down the server was quick to bring us chips and salsa which the salsa was unbelievably good. The chips were fresh hot and crispy. As the food came out it was hot ready and great. The prices were very reasonable for the amount of food was more than expected.   I ordered the chicken fajitas. It came out and it was well more than a normal chicken breast on top of tons of veggies and unbelievable fixings.  One of my coworkers ordered three tacos and a margarita all were good. The other coworker ordered a burrito which was the special that evening could not finish it. If you're in this area stop in and check out their specials as well as the atmosphere.

Salsa is good with the Warm Chips, but not spicy. Queso was bland, I wish I had gotten the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp but I got the Steak Quesadilla instead. It was okay and the reason I said it was,  because it had a liquid Cheese Whiz product in it instead of REAL cheese. It was disappointing to me, but a couple other people at the table said they liked it like that, so everybody has an opinion. The Service was great ! We had a big Birthday Party and they really worked it well. Nice servers and right at your needs. Like I said, the Bacon wrapped Shrimp is wonderful, the Fried  Chimichanga was huge and rated really good by another one in the party. Make reservations, it gets very busy !",

I should know, being born and raised in real Mexican or TexMex this meets the bar. Tonight I ordered an array of tacos starting with the namesake taco, then the fried fish taco and the shrimp. All were flavorful and spicy when needed. It was perfection with a margarita on the side!

Except \"Chez\" has a spinach-queso that is superior to any cheese dip I've had anywhere -- and I've had hundreds!  That includes the average chile con queso at Paco's.  Unfortunately, despite the upscale, nice atmosphere, the food at both restaurants is only average.  Same for the service.  It is a nice place to go and if I lived in Charlotte, I'd go back.  But the overall experience is only average.  The charro beans were nothing more than pinto beans.  Everything else was just average.  But it was hot (temp) at least.    We sat at a two-seater in the bar area that was much too small for anything more than drinks.  We had to balance our chips and drinks on the ledge next to us, which unnerved the people dining below (and I don't blame them).

The service was very slow, and it really wasn't busy.  We got there at seven, and it took a good strong half hour for our food.  I had Chicken Fajitas and my companion had a chicken quesadilla. I ordered a house margarita, and it was undrinkable - way too sour!!!   Not sure what they use for a sour mix, but it's awful.  I'm usually good for at least two drinks, tonight I left half of my first.  The frozen margarita, not as bad.  They were quick to bring menus, water, chips and salsa, but then everything slowed down.  The food OK, the margarita, not OK - don't think we'll be back, but we gave it a try.  Well over an hour for dinner.",

    "text": "The few times I've been to Paco's, I have found the food to be underwhelming (it's not the best Tex Mex I've ever had, but it's not the worst, and it usually leaves me full and bringing home leftovers). I've had a wide variety of meals at Paco's, and it has always been the company and the margaritas that keeps me coming back, not really the food. The first time I went to Paco's, I got a taco platter, and while they were good, they weren't stand out or spectacular. I've also tried the enchiladas, but my issue with those is I'm more of an authentic kind of gal, and enchies (a very technical and affectionate term for enchiladas) made with sour cream chicken,  or topped with chili gravy don't really wow me (plus they were drowning in sauce, which after bite three made them soggy). My friend can't say enough nice things about Paco's salads (she loves the chopped salad and the Paco's salad), but the one time I went the salad route the veggies didn't seem fresh and the honey cilantro lime dressing was overpowering, and I was disappointed yet again. Yet, I could never write Paco's off (my friends loyally go and say I will find something I like), so I keep giving them more chances. A few weeks ago I was happy I didn't give up on Paco's.  By far the star of the show at Paco's is the fajitas. As I was browsing the menu to try something new yet again (my fallback was going to be to branch out at get some tacos I'd never tried) I stumbled upon the fajita platters tucked in the first page of their new menu. Paco's delivered on steak fajitas, and I was thrilled. The steak was seared to my liking and super tender. It looked beautiful; there were ample grill marks and it was simple and straightforward, which allowed its smoky flavor to shine. An abundance of vegetables accompanied the steak on the sizzling platter, and the peppers and onions melted in my mouth and burst with flavor on each bite. I tucked my precious steak and veggies into piping hot, soft flour tortillas, and topped them with traditional fixings (beans, cheese, lettuce, pico de gallo, guacamole and sour cream) before gorging myself.

    "text": "Can not give enough kudos to Pacos Tacos and Tequila. I thought we would never come across a decent tex mex in Charlotte. Yay! The Holy Guacamole done at tableside is perfection. They put just the right amount of salt and lime to get your mouth watering for one of their great margaritas and don't be afraid of going all in on the chili. It's a nice compliment to the avacado and not very spicy at all. We also tried the tortilla soup which was made in a nice light broth and chicken burrito that could have been shared by two men with big appetites and completely satisfied them. Overall the food was outstanding for Tex Mex and the price was great.  Our server was very friendly and the food came out right when we wanted it to. We also really enjoyed the setting. For me the only thing that could have made it better would be some Chili Rellenos on the menu, but other than that I was a happy camper. There has been a lot of thought put into the upfit of the restaurant space. We were seated in the back of the restaurant which has a great decor and nice natural lighting coming through its roof which is plastered with skylights. We all agreed this will become one of our regular Charlotte haunts. Thanks Pacos!",

Since I've had the opportunity to eat there quite a bit, I've tried most of the entrees and appetizers. Some of my favorites include: the veggie quesadilla, chicken fajita salad, paco's tacos, and the sour cream chicken enchiladas.        The service is great, which is always a reason to come back.  The wait staff and managers are always attentive and prompt; I don't think I've ever seen the bottom of a glass without a new one being brought to the table first.  If you've eaten at some of Frank's other restaurants (Cantina 1511, Big Daddy's, Mama Ricottas..) you know that poor service is never an issue.     Because of the great food and mindful staff it is defiantly worth checking out.  It's family friendly but you can also enjoy a casual date without being overwhelmed. They also have started some really good drink specials throughout the week (try the Texas Rose with pear infused tequila). The price point in the right place as well.",

Where it fell short was in the appetizer size for the money - I enjoy chicken nachos that are stacked high since tortillas are so inexpensive and taste great!  Paco's was good tasting but the chips were a single layer of chips smothered soggy by the chicken/cheese topping.  rate 2.5 The main meal was good but what I want to mention is the \"fried\" ice cream which another customer had about the same comments regarding the coating and presentation.  I could not tell what the coating was made of and there was adequate ice cream to share but it was soft and did not seem crispy.  served on a plate rather than in a cinnamon/sugared tortilla shell it was not what was expected.  It was eaten because I wanted to taste it and figure out what the coating was...rated 1.5 Would I return - maybe for the margaritas and chips and salsa - however, consider a TK klub and punch a card for each different tk tried and award a food item, tshirt, or discount for a meal, or something to encourage patron ship.  Will I give the food a second chance...maybe but they need to reconsider the fried ice cream...",

    "text": "Food-wise, this place is already at 4, 4 1/2 stars.  Add in the fantastic margaritas and cocktails and it surpasses five stars.  My favorite is the Firestarter which is weird because I don't like ginger beer.  It is made with GB and jalapeno infused tequila and is a kick to your tastebuds.  The one I don't recommend is the one made with 100 year old Cointreau.  Not because it is bad, but it is not worth $16.  My wife always gets the quesedilla.  The chicken is tender and juicy and the tortilla crisp.  The quesedilla comes with guac, sour cream and pico de gallo which are all delicious.  The guac is fresh made (I've been told) and the pico de gallo also seems very fresh.  I have tried a wide variety of things but I always get the stuffed jalapenos.  They are wrapped in bacon and stuffed with cheese.  Sometimes spicier than others, but always good.  I often get the steak or chicken fajitas.  While pricier than your \"mom & Pop\" places, they are worth it.  You don't get a little pile of steak that looks like shoe leather.  This is real steak, cut well and cooked properly.  It is not tough at all and you can actually bite through it unlike at some places.",

We decided to skip the appetizers and go straight to the entrees . We ordered the shrimp fajitas and the roasted vegetables enchilada . The fajitas were good , the standard fajitas you find in any Mexican restaurant. However , we were very disappointed with the enchilada . It was very doughy, the roasted vegetables lack the taste and the beans overwhelmed the plate . The only good thing  on that plate were the empanadas . The good service made up for that enchilada .

The Yelp reviews fooled me- normally they are spot on. The jalapeno cucumber margarita was good.  Not very spicy however.  The no name margarita was gross.  I would have been angry if it wasn't on special for $5.  Overly sweet and week.   The volcano dip was just okay.  A little too thick for my husband and my taste.   The tortillas were great and defiantly house made.  I had the beef brisket, grilled fish and turkey tacos.   The brisket was a little dry but okay with some hot sauce.  Turkey and fish tacos had good flavor.  Charro beans were not hot.  Had they been they might have tasted better.  The worst of the night was the tres leches cake.  The driest cake I have ever had.  What kind of tres leches isn't moist.  My kids eat anything and they left the entire thing on the plate.   The server was okay.  We had to ask her for things two and three times.  She was nice enough. On a positive the salsa had good flavor.  Will I come back ?? Probably not.",

    "text": "My visit to Paco's Tacos was mixed.  I was immediately disappointed to learn that they no longer offered the option to \"build your own\" margarita. I had been looking forward to that after reading about it in a number of reviews.  Instead I ordered from their decent list of \"specialty\" margaritas. I had the Paco's Eldorado on the waitress' recommendation. It was good margarita, but perhaps a bit too sweet for me. In fairness, the waitress said it was one of the sweeter ones and she was right.. For my second drink, I had the Firestarter which has their homemade jalapeno-infused tequila and ginger beer. This drink was really good, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has a low tolerance for spicy food but I would definitely order it again.  For my meal I had the three taco combo.  First up was the Paco's Taco, a beef brisket taco \"slow roasted chili rubbed beef brisket with caramelized onions and chipotle bbq sauce.\"  This one had come highly rated from a friend and several of the online reviewers.  Honestly I don't get it.  What I got was a tortilla with a huge lump of dry flavorless meat. I didn't detect any onion or bbq at aall. A huge let down.  Next I had the Big River Fish Taco. This was better than the Paco's Taco. The mango salsa was a nice touch.   Finally the Shake Down Shrimp Taco. This was by far the best of my three tacos. Nice flavor and the right amount of shrimp.  The shrimp were not as hot as I would have liked but tasty nonetheless.  The complementary chips and salsa (both red and verde) were good and the staff did a great job keeping our chip bowl full.  Our waitress was also quite good and checked on us frequently but not so much as to be a nuisance.",

I had the steak fajitas and they were average not bad, just not exciting, and the vegetables were mush. The person I was with got a chimichanga  and it was really dry and tasteless. The tortilla chips were good and the salsa was really good! It had a decent heat and flavor to it and the chips seemed fresh.   The main reason I give it 2 and not 3 stars is because this place prides itself on it's tequila selection and it's \"oh so delicious\" margaritas.  I'm here to tell you they were not good.  The house margarita which was on special was pure sour mix and it wasn't a good sour mix either.  I had a different margarita (can't remember the name but it was the one with grand marnier), and again it just wasn't good.  My uncle makes an amazing margarita with grand marnier and this definitely did not compare (maybe I'm biased).  I was also disappointed not to see any real Sangria choices as I prefer that to margaritas when out and the wine prices are jacked up beyond belief  (I saw a few choices that they were charges by the glass the same price as you could get the entire bottle for at the store). I realize that some raising of the prices is needed to make a profit but $12 for a glass of wine that you can by the entire bottle for the same price?? Yeah I'm not buying that one!!   Needless to say I will probably give this place a second shot and update my review but currently not a fan!",

I usually order a burrito, but I don't reallty like the sauce they put on top of them and I always feel so full and tired when I got back to work afterwards.    Yesterday, I went with fish tacos and they were really good!  Homemade tortilla which tastes great and the taco itself was delicious.  It comes with a side of rice and beans.  I got the black beans.  These were both meh.  It's a good place to go if you work in Southpark for lunch-they are really quick about getting you taken care of for a quick bite.",

    "text": "I was very excited to try out another of Frank Scibelli's concepts. I've been a longterm fan of Bad Daddy's and Midwood Smokehouse. I had heard good things about the tortillas and their specials. Glad we finally got this concept in the books!   Tucked behind the Williams Sonoma on Morrison, it's a secluded location that comes alive for a BIG dinner crowd. Plenty of parking in the lot and other lots surrounding the shopping center.   Our visit was for dinner recently. We had tried other nights but the way can be rather overwhelming. We made it in for an 8pm dinner.   Service was great. Seated quickly, given a good rundown of the menu and recommended a few margaritas for us to try. We obliged and tried the original marg and a mango-infused marg. Sad to say, I was rather unimpressed with the mix. I'm not much of a margaritas goer, but the balance was wrong and seemed to be thrown together rather fast without much consideration for taste. I was a little disappointed since it was a bit of a slower night in the dining room(s) and the bar. On to the meal...  Chips are great. Light, lightly salted and served with an array of salsas. The standard red salsa has a twinge of heat and an smoke to the flavor. The tomatillo is freaking great. Uhh...I think I put it on everything but my margarita. Definitely worth the tomatillo alone.   Entrees: My wife, as many know, is a vegetarian. The menu actually reads \"Ask about our vegetarian options.\" Sadly, there aren't actual \"options.\" Our server pointed to a few regular items that can be made sans meat. She ordered the Gringo Nachos. The only options listed on the menu are chicken, ground beef or brisket. Her order only came with the standard veggies. Rather underwhelming and definitely screaming for some more cheese.   I ordered the standard Paco's Tacos. An order of two that comes with rice and beans. The rice was pretty standard and a welcome accompaniment to my tacos. The beans, however, are a \"charro\" style recipe. Can't say that I'm a fan. Very burnt flavor and lacking in welcoming texture. With a generous helping of the tomatillo salsa, they were in the clear! The tacos were GREAT. Love the tortillas. Made in-house, and boy does it show. Warm, chewy and perfect floury taste. I could 5 with just the tomatillo salsa. The brisket is worth a try. Never had it on tacos before, but I would definitely order it again. Seasoned well and paired nicely with the other taco accouterment.   Price is rather fair. No complaints in that department.   I'd say there are a few things that could have been done a bit better, but we'll definitely be back to try some other options. Looking forward to those warm tortillas again soon! Thanks, Frank Scibelli for another option in the Queen City!",

Be aware weekends are packed, it was going to be an hr wait but we got lucky with a bar table. The service in our opinion was slow, maybe due to how busy. Server was super nice when we got grab her. We ordered cheese dip, I got a chimichanga and my husband their trio option. Dip was fine, salsa was pretty hot they served. My chimichanga with beef was ok, it honestly tasted more like a cheeseburger! My husband said his was just ok and for the price we won't return. It was over $50 for two dishes, queso and one beer...we feel we can find really good Mexican for about half that price. I'm not sure if this is a chain but felt more like that than a local place.",

    "text": "Authentic Mexican taqueria? Nope! Paco's Tacos is unabashedly Tex-Mex fusion at its best. Shortly after opening, it became our go-to spot in South Park and hasn't fallen from its lofty perch.  I honestly haven't had a bad item on the menu, but some of my favorites are the (free!) tomatillo salsa, the Shakedown Shrimp taco and the fajitas. Yes! Fajitas! These aren't your typical chain restaurant fajitas, but ones made with top notch ingredients fried in drawn Mexican butter. Oh, and don't forget about the namesake Paco's Taco, made with spice, tender beef brisket barbecue, that sums up the Tex-Mex fusion philosophy perfectly. And the margaritas are good, especially the tequila infused Firestarter. And the guacamole. And the specials. And they always have a Shiner Bock seasonal on tap. And... OK, you get the idea, right? At Paco's Taco's, it's ALL good!",

We struck with one of the lower cost ones, still $9 a shot, but she persisted. Food was good enough. Retired to the bar, ordered a round of drinks, threw $80 on the bar. Money and bill gone, we order more drinks. New bill shows up with all the drinks from the first round still listed.  Pointed it out to the female bartender and she returned the $80. She must've figured that there were so many of us, someone else would pay. She's a crook. Cute small brunette, with a black spot on her soul.  Dear managers. You've got a problem.

    "text": "So we decided to venture out of our box and decide to give Paco's Tacos a try. We are very loyal to a certain Mexican joint in Indian Trail and we never cheat on them. However we had been given a gift card to Paco's Tacos and we couldn't allow it to go to waste. We showed up on a Saturday night at 7:30 and had to wait about 20 minutes. Not bad for a Saturday. The place was crowded and loud but the chips an salsa eased my pain. They were very tasty, almost to tasty if you know what I mean. The only disappointment was the Salsa was a bit to hot for my 2 little ones and they didn't have anything milder. Bummer for my kids and bummer for me because I had to listen to them complain.   On the recommendation of our waiter, who looked like Dale Earnhardt JR. BTW, we should mix and match the tacos. I had the fried Fish Taco and the Beef Brisket Taco. The fried fish was very good, light , crispy and well seasoned. It gets an A+ in my book. The Beef Brisket was pretty bad. It tasted like Pot Roast. Even my Husband agreed with me and that NEVER happens. The taco had no Mexican flavors whatsoever unfortunately. It truly tasted like a bland Pot Roast. With the Tacos came rice (I've had better) and these beans that were called Churro Beans. OMG, they were very DELISH!!!! Pinto Beans with raw onion, bacon and some wonderful Latin spices. I could have eaten a HUGE bowl of them and left very happy. My Husband had the Calamari taco and the Shrimp taco. Both were good. I will probably stick with the Fish Tacos in the future.   All in all ,Pacos Tacos is OK not great, IMO. I will most likely give it another try. Maybe for lunch next time around.",

It accommodates just about anyone ... young or old. And that's why I like it.   Before I dined at Paco's Tacos I thought it was a \"dive type place\" with cheap Mexican food. The name kind of led me to think that.   Well, once I finally went to Paco's I discovered it's just the opposite. It's not a little \"Mom and Pop\" place, nor is it a dive restaurant. Paco's is not super cheap but also not crazy expensive. It's a little more upscale than the majority of Mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area. With that said, if you're looking for fancy, there are a few nicer upscale \"Spanish influenced/Mexican restaurants\" in the Charlotte area.  Anyway, as far as Paco's Tacos goes this place is yummy. They give you chips and salsa like all Mexican restaurants and are great with refilling both as needed. There salsa is chunky and slightly spicy and really gets your taste buds going.   The past few times I've been there I've ordered the Taco's. You can get two or three it's up to you and the options are endless.   They give you the choice of house made flour tortillas, house made wheat tortillas, low carb tortillas, crispy yellow tacos or soft corn tortillas. \"I like the crispy tacos\". Normally when I'm going to Paco's I'm craving Americanized Mexican food and this place is perfect for that. When I'm craving more complicated Spanish influenced food I go somewhere else ... but that's another review.  Your taco meal is served with red rice and citrus chipotle slaw and your choice of charro, black or refried beans. I really like both the black and refried beans.  I normally get two tacos but my three favorite to choose from are the:  GRINGO BEEF Taco Seasoned ground beef, lettuce, pico de gallo, guacamole and mixed cheeses. \"Very all American\"  PACO'S TACO - a slightly spicy Beef Brisket Taco. Before you get it the chili rubbed beef brisket is slow roasted for 6 hours with caramelized onions and chipotle bbq sauce. YUM!  or the:  WOOD GRILLED CHICKEN Onions and bell peppers, lettuce, pico de gallo, guacamole and mixed cheeses \"This one just tastes fresh and delicious\"   I've had a ton of other things at Paco's but I keep coming back to these three taco choices. They're just YUMMY!  If you're looking for a drink and aren't sure what to get their margaritas are perfect. I'm pretty simple when it comes to drinks so I go with a traditional margarita on the rocks with salt. Try it you won't be sorry.   If you're looking for a starter while waiting for your entree go with this one:   UNHOLY GUACAMOLE 9 Yum ... and the best part is it's made fresh at your table.   Honestly you can't go wrong if you stick with the Mexican staples. The food won't disappoint and the ambiance is great for just about anyone.   Enjoy!",

    "text": "We came on a Friday night and the place was quite busy.  We sat at the bar and had a margarita.  I tried the Artic Margarita which is an $8 special on Friday nights (usually $12).  That's nice it's a special for $8 because I really don't think any mixed drink is worth $12 - unless it straight up. The Artic Margarita is good.  I also had the watermelon margarita with a muddled jalapeno. One of the guys had the really peppery margarita which in a way was good but you'd better like spicy.  I have to agree with the rest of the reviewers - the chips are the best!  and the red and green salsa are great as well.  I went for the 2 taco dish ($10 - can't beat that).  I ordered the grilled white fish taco and the skirt steak taco.  Plenty of food and delicious.  Everything looks and tastes fresh.  Everyone at the table really enjoyed their meal.  I did notice that there was a kids menu, so we will definetly be coming back with the kids as well.  One thing I did notice was that the bar scene didn't seem very active.  We left about 9:45p on a Friday night and the place was empty.  Seemed that people just come to eat.  Though they have an extensive margarita menu and a full bar.",

The funny thing is I thought Manzetti's was still at that location?  I bumped into some folks from work, so this place is popular and even met a local micro-brewer from the Coast having some of his beers being tried out at the place that evening so a good time was had by all.  Tucked away near South Park Mall, Pacos is a great little place with some awesome selection of tequila, great guacamole, and a menu that I look forward to trying throughout 2011.  There are specials, but so far I've just ordered off the menu.  The bar is long and the table plenty, plus in the warmer months there is a patio...for which I don't think Charlotte has nearly enough of them.  Texas BBQ is good...and I also like Mexican, but Pacos is the best Tex Mex in these parts hands down.",

I swore we'd make it to the restaurant SOON after I gobbled 3 plates of tacos, fajitas, salad, chips, guacamole...  Anyhow, FF a few months and we finally made it there.  I was worried it would be too much of a bar atmosphere for our little high chair patron, but was so excited to find it extremely kid friendly.  Crayons and other toys to distract the little ones....we were able to enjoy a wonderful meal of perfectly spiced guacamole, wood fired chicken (exquisite taste), and I love that they offer whole wheat tortillas.   Love the tomatillo salsa - and lots of Shiner beers on tap to choose from.  Fantastic!  DEFINITELY warrants a trip back!",

The chips and salsa are awesome and my toddler daughter was pleased with her chicken fingers. But my wife and I split the lunch chicken fajitas and they were, to say the least, the weirdest fajitas we've ever had.   I'm no Tex-Mex expert, but my experience with fajitas is that they're strips of chicken, onions, and peppers served sizzling on a cast-iron platter.  The vegetables are typically cooked just past the point of tenderness.  The fajitas brought to our table consisted of chunks of what appeared to be a small baked breast atop a pile of what appeared to be an overdone pepper/onion mash which was bitter to the taste.  The sides (guac, pico, cheese, lettuce) were excellent though.  I'm still a big fan of Frank's Cantina 1511 and Mama Ricotta's but not crazy about Big (Bad) Daddy's though or now, Paco's.",

For those who have been there, you know, as we do now, this is not at all where they're located. They're across the street from the mall, behind Williams & Sonoma. We were 10 minutes late to meet our dinner companions as we drove around the mall completely confused. A text from our friends got us back on track.  When calling ahead, we also added our name to the call-ahead seating list, even though they weren't on a wait at the time. We thought they might be by the time we got there 20 minutes later on a Saturday evening, which they were. Our friends, who'd arrived before us, asked if our names were on the list. They were told no, given a pager, and told the wait would be 10-15 minutes. When we arrived, the hostesses were not welcoming or friendly. We asked again about our name being on the list, and lo and behold, they found it. They gave us a new pager. 25 minutes later, after seeing numerous other parties seated, we were seated by another unfriendly hostess.  Sitting two tables away from the large glass windows, there was such a cold draft, I ended up putting my coat back on. I was grateful we weren't seated in the booth right up against the window. However, my table seat location right next to the aforementioned booth, meant the server's & guacamole maker's butts were right in my face when they were waiting on that booth. Ugh.  Tonight's saving grace: our server, Jim. He was on top of things. He was quick to take our order, quick with the drink & chip refills. And when he noticed my husband's chili had come with cheese on it, despite the request for none, he promptly delivered a corrected version (albeit then it was missing the scallions also).  The tableside guacamole is a nice trend I've seen in several restaurants. Paco's is just OK. It was pretty salty but lacking in much other flavor. All four of us felt the same way about that. For the price, I expected better.  Soups and fajitas were good and flavorful. Margarita was OK but overpriced in my opinion. The guys liked both their beers and thought the price was reasonable. (If we go back, I guess I know what drink I'll be getting instead!)  The menu said something about a $2 split-plate charge, which I find rather silly. We're getting the same exact meal, right? We didn't even get an extra plate. What are we paying the extra fee for? Lucky for us, our bill did not include that, which we sheepishly did not point out to our server. (Now if I find out split plates are indeed more generous portions, then I understand the additional fee!)  For the price we paid for this Saturday night out meal, (thank goodness for a $10 coupon!), I expected more from the experience.",

The quesadilla that should have chicken in it was mostly just filled with cheese. Hubby ordered the beef beef brisket. It was way to salty & cold. I had the fajitas which were tasty.

I ordered the crispy shrimp taco in a crispy corn taco shell, my husband ordered a veggie quesadilla (Friday during Lent for all you Catholics out there...no meat!) and our grand total came to $14. This $14 included a HUGE bag of crispy chips and two kinds of salsa. I felt a little guilty paying less than $15 for dinner! But I got over it.  Thumbs up!

    "text": "Ah Paco's, I was really excited to try your tequila soaked spot. Too bad I came for lunch and didn't get a chance to indulge in a big mamma jamma margarita, but that's for next time. Onto my lunch experience...  I met a great business contact here and we enjoyed a tasty lunch. What we did not enjoy was great service - something I have come to expect from a Frank Scibelli restaurant. No, no one was outright rude or mean, our server was just kind of a dud of sorts. I don't know if he was having a bad day or just needs more training but it wasn't great.   First, the food... I ordered the Chicken Enchiladas and they were tasty. They were topped with a creamy queso and a bit of sour cream mixture. The chicken was tender and I enjoyed the two enchiladas. The refried beans were standard as was the rice. My only gripe? I wish it had a little more spice - in all components. The flavor of the chicken and the dish as a whole would be much elevated with a little kick.   The service...sorry for the long, drawn out info... Our server was just kind of absent - he wasn't engaging, didn't help much with recommendations and he also forgot a few things that my dining companion asked for on the side, one being chopped jalapenos. When my dining companion asked for fresh, chopped jalapenos on the side our server looked at her and blankly said, \"I don't think we have any fresh jalapenos.\" Really, that's odd...we both thought. Then she said, well I'd appreciate any jalapenos please. Once our food came out, no jalapenos. So we politely asked the runner for the same request, and fresh chopped jalapenos came out in seconds. Ok....  And then the bill. So, it was my fault for not digging into the bill pad, but our sever did indeed give me the bill as I requested, on one check. There was a bit of confusion as I requested a copy of the full bill, and I didn't see one in the check pad, etc. Regardless, it was in there and that's my fault for not digging, but after the manager brought me a copy of the bill and reconciled (my) error the server said, \"You need to tell my manager it's ok, because otherwise you're going to get me in trouble.\" Hmm. Nice. I happily told the manager there was not problem and it was my misunderstanding, I was chatting with my business contact, didn't notice, etc. I apologized but I thought it was pretty rude for the server to go there, if you know what I mean.  So, long story short, the food was good and I definitely want to come back and give it another go but I hope that server's having a better day and if not, I hope I'm seated in another section.",

    "text": "Really enjoyed my experience at Paco's Tacos last night.   Had a group of 10-12 people we were planning on, was able to call in and make a reservation with no problem, even though some of our party wasn't going to be there until after our reservation time.  Waiter and helpers were fantastic.  Did a great job explaining the different drinks and different menu items that were new to us.  The appetizers are pretty good, especially the unholy guacamole.  The bottlecaps/pickle chips appetizer was ok, however I was disappointed by the amount of fried jalapenos we got, they were hard to find and the dish was mostly fried pickles.  Entrees were great.  I got the Paco's Taco (brisket) and BBQ Shrimp.  Others were raving about the Gringo taco, Enchiladas, Skirt steak and Chicken.  No one was unhappy with their food.  Drinks were inventive, including the mango infused vodka drink with ginger beer.  You also can't beat a 20 oz. draft of Shiner for $5, at least not at a restaurant.  Overall was a great experience.",

    "text": "I'm from the Charlotte area but recently moved. I was in town for a friend's birthday and went to Paco's Tacos. The restaurant had been closed so it could be remodeled. We went on the first night it was back open and got there before the party so we decided to get a drink at the bar. I tried to find the purse hook with my hands and hung my purse on one. I look at my hands and have dark paint all over my hands. I look at my Hudson jeans and have dark paint all over them. I ask the bartender if the bar had been painted in the remodel. He said \"yes\" and I showed him my hands and said \"the paint isn't dry and it's all over my pants too\". He went and got someone above him and she spoke with me and gave me a card for her manager.  She said that I should call her manager and they would pay to get my jeans dry cleaned. Didn't offer anything else...not to buy me a new pair of $150 jeans , no drink on the house, no free taco, no free appetizer, nothing. I'm not the kind of person that tries to get free anything from a restaurant. I'm really understanding when it comes to a restaurant mishap, because I, myself, used to work as a server. I just thought it was handled very poorly. I took my jeans by a dry cleaner and they said that they couldn't get the paint out.  Great! My pants are ruined. :(",

Volcano queso is the best queso in the world and their house made tortillas are also the best in the world, but their machine broke and they haven't made those in months- the only thing that's made me disappointed with this restaurant ever. The Grilled Skirt Steak Taco and the Tanked Up Taco are my favorites. It really isn't the same since they haven't made their house made tortillas and I haven't gone as often as I used to because of it, but I will still give it five stars.",

Manager said if I had ordered the queso as my \"entree\" as opposed to requesting an extra plate, there would have been no charge.  Refused to remove the charge.  She simply said \" it's been a policy that hasn't been consistently enforced\" and \"it is printed on the menu\".

We ordered a pitcher of margaritas, white queso, and the table made guacamole to start. The margaritas were good, but could have been a little stronger. The queso was delicious- duh. And the guacamole was awesome because you can customize it since its table made- it's also a huge portion. The server also brought salsa and chips. The salsa was SPICY! We also got tomatillo salsa that was less spicy and tasty. The chips are super thin and you will eat way too many.   I ordered enchiladas de dennis with charro (pinto beans with onions, bacon, and brisket) and my girlfriend got the 3 taco combo with rice and retried beans. Both entrees were $13 which was very reasonable because it was a LOT of food...or maybe we were full from all the chips.   The enchiladas were so good, covered in cheese and tons of flavor. My girlfriend got the Paco Taco (10 hour smoked beef brisket), Tanked Up (beer battered white fish), and Shake Down Shrimp tacos. They were all delicious! The tortillas are thick, more like pita but they are stuffed full so maybe the thickness is to hold it all in. Whatever it is, it's good!   My girlfriend has already said she wants to have her birthday dinner here, which is 7 months away. There was a bacon, egg, and cheese enchilada we might have to try out.  Overall the restaurants atmosphere was relaxed and funky, the service was good, and the food was amazing. Check this place out ASAP!",

    "text": "If I had to die, my last meal on earth would be Mexican. I love it so I rate it very highly. And after a recent bad experience at a competitor's Mexican restaurant I decided to try Paco's Tacos for the first time.   I came here on a Thursday night around 8 with my husband and a friend. It was pretty busy, but we got seated right away. Our server greeted us with water, chips and salsa. The salsa was great. It wasn't chunky (my husband isn't a fan of tomatoes) and had the right amount of spice. The chips were light and crispy. They tasted homemade. They were too good I couldn't stop eating them.   I ordered the two taco combo, which came with rice, slaw and beans. All for only $11 (they are full size tacos too!)  I got the charro beans. It reminded me of baked beans and was something different from your typical black or refried beans. For my tacos, I mixed and matched. The shrimp taco was my favorite. The chipotle ranch sauce was on point and there was TONS of shrimp on it!! There had to be at least 10 pieces. I also got the turkey carnitas. The turkey was moist and not dry. I would recommend the shrimp instead. My husband got the Paco's taco (beef brisket), which was my second fav.   Overall good vibes at Paco's tacos. I would highly recommend it to anyone and I will be back soon!   Ps try the slaw with your rice. It's awesome.",

I would either suggest Paco's Tacos or Sabor Latin Street.   I have sampled a few of the tacos and they're all pretty delish. If your not as hungry I would suggest ordering the chicken tortilla soup bowl. It's perfect for cold nights and it will fill you up for only $5. We also tried a jalapeno shot. Please do yourself a favor and don't try it thinking it's cool or something. We tried it and I felt like there was a goldfish inside my stomach instantly... No bueno. Other than that everything is pretty awesome not the mention the service and the lovely dim light atmosphere. Enjoy!",

Husband enjoyed the Chopped Salad, large portion very filling. We each shared a few bites. I found the salad dressing quite tasty. A flavorful chipotle ranch without the overbearing smoky spice chipotle can often be. A wonderful blend of fresh veggies with a delicious dressing. Fantastic dinner!",

Since it's near some hotels, I sometimes recommend it as a good spot for a nice meal and good margaritas. However, today was my first time actually dining here after meeting one of the chefs and taking him home from work.  We were window shopping at the South Park mall and decided to come here around 5:30 on a Sunday. We were sat quickly in a comfortable part of the restaurant and immediately greeted with a smile and the customary chips and salsa. My wife, who doesn't like spicy things, really enjoyed the sauce which had just the right amount of kick! We also ordered some table-side guacamole, which was fresh and tasty but felt a little bland. We make our guacamole at home with lime juice, so that is probably a matter of taste.  That night, they had a special edition \"blackened salmon\" taco which sounded delicious, but we did not try it. I had the \"enchiladas de Dennis\" and my wife had the roasted vegetable enchiladas. She got some fried plantains on her plate, which were sweet and delicious! Great rice and beans. The plates themselves were a little bland, but nothing a little salt, pepper and Tapatio can't solve.  I also tried the Pineapple & Mint Margarita, which was like a cross among a Mai Tai, a margarita and a mojito. It was a really creative drink that I enjoyed.  Overall, I would say it's a great spot. Good, affordable food, quick service, good drinks and a great atmosphere. Would definitely recommend to just about anyone.",

We ordered the large queso ($8) - it tasted like the stuff that we get it of the plastic bowl from Harris Teeter. I ordered the quesadilla and it was okay - small and the chicken lacked flavor. My wife ordered the tacos and the carnitas were dry. Our service was sub-par especially when we sent our tacos back and the server kept asking us if \"everything was good\" - we basically will not be going back to Paco's again.",

Perhaps this isn't fair, being from South Florida but how dare these people call that shameful drink a margarita. It was awful and for eight dollars (the house), it should have been spectacular. Of course we didn't learn our lesson. My husband ordered a fourteen dollar margarita, in a vain attempt at putting the last one behind us. If you like battery acid and mediocre food, go there.",

I enjoyed both the green and red salsas and split a pitches of margaritas with my group- which oddly our server did not recommend to do. He said the pitches makes the margaritas get a little too watery- which I think could be fixed by not filling it so high with ice and having glasses full of ice to pour into. Overall it was a great drink $35 for a pitcher of house margaritas which had about seven pours.   Let me just say. This brisket is banging. I also has the charro beans which despite being cooked with bacon were nothing to write home about. Get the brisket. Prices are also pretty fair considering its Southpark and all.",

In fact, I ended up getting the enchiladas de denis which I also order at Cantina. This comes served with red rice and your choice of beans - which for me is always black beans.  It was good, but nothing I haven't had before.   If I lived in the neighborhood, this would probably be a place I would come to more often, but since we have a Cantina 1511 in the 28277 area, we'll probably stick to that instead.",

Their chips and salsa are some of the best I have ever had.  The drinks are an issue in this establishment. Beer is reasonable but their wine prices are way to high. Louis Martini Cabernet for $12.99 a glass? The whole bottle in a retail store cost $15 and the wholesale price is around $10-$12 per bottle. So I figure they have a 4x to 5x markup on a bottle which is outrageous. The same issue exists with some of their other drinks as indicated in other reviews.   Stick with the Tex Mex and Beer when visiting this restaurant.",

When we sat down our server stopped by to let us know she was a bit busy, but she knew we were there and she was coming right over! Sometimes a little bit of expectation setting can go a long way. We had the white cheese dip. The dip had the white cheese flavor you would expect, but a bit more salty and creamy. I had fish tacos and they were AWESOME!

    "text": "One of the BEST Mexican Spots in Charlotte Area....  I'll jump right into the salsa of the matter here - the food was great, the service was great, the ambiance was great, the prices were very reasonable...  Food:  I ordered the giant monster, burrito, which came stuffed with caramelized onions, bell peppers and red rice, I ordered a mix of chicken and steak as I wanted to sample both of the meats.  The waitress was more than happy to accommodate me in this request.  My date ordered the steak quesadillias.  Both of our entrees were delectable and were served to perfection.  I couldn't imagine what more anyone could want from a giant, monster burrito.  It was loaded with meats, both tender and succulent.  In addition the burrito was accompanied with a scoop of sour cream, pico, and guacamole (at my request) and rice.  My date loved the taste her quesadillas and explained that the skirt steak was juicy and tender. -We ordered the Coastal Calamari as an appetizer.  It too was amazing.  As a calamari lover, there is nothing worse than tough, overcooked calamari.  SO you can imagine my elation when we received a big plate of warm, tender and not overcooked, calamari!  It included two different types of dipping sauce, a red based marinara-type sauce and another white, \"mystery sauce\" which was also quite tasty.   -The chips and salsa are on par with crack in their addictive powers.  The chips are perfect, served warm, fresh and with a dab of salt.  The salsa is also excellent and taste fresh.  The best part is that they bring you as much of each, as you want.    Service:  Our service was excellent.  I could not have asked for more as far as friendliness and promptness.  When we needed water refilled, they were.  When we needed more chips and salsa, it was there.  When we needed our entrees after a five minute wait, they were there.    Prices:  The prices were very reasonable, $38.69, but I was able to use my City pass coupon and save $10 (see pics).  Not bad for two adults and that includes a Dos XX Amber and an appetizer.    I don't know if Paco's is actually the NUMBER ONE Mexican spot in Charlotte, but it is certainly in the conversation and one would be remiss not to consider Paco's Tacos and Tequila when looking for good Mexican in the Charlotte area.    I'll leave you with two statements:  1. This place is waaaaay better than the new La Paz at the Met.  2. I'll be back here soon.",

While it's made table size, they never asked how spicy we wanted it and overall I thought it was too bland to order again. Next time we will try the chorizo queso.

We tried the No Name Margarita and another one which I forget the name, but it was fruity with some orange flavor.  We honestly did not like either flavors but they were definitely strong.  The homemade guacamole is pretty good and we ordered quesedillas which were good as well, but the food came out much too quickly.  If we wanted fast food we would have gone to taco bell!

I had the Pick 3 tacos: a traditional Paco's brisket taco, the chicken one, and flank steak taco. Each just a little different, so I wished there were other choices of salsa to pick from.

    "text": "Start off by saying the food was AMAZING! You start with chips and salsa like most Mexican restaurants. The salsa was really good! I also got the house margarita, also really good. Not your premix margarita, this tasted freshly made! I had 2 tacos. A paco taco and smokey & the brisket. Oh my so delicious! You could taste the smoke in the brisket! I liked the smokey & the brisket a little better because it had a fresh tomato salsa that made the taco very refreshing.  My husband had the open face pork quesadilla. He would not stop raving about how good they were.  The services was fantastic! We made a reservation and did not have to wait on a Saturday night at 730. Our waiter was also really friendly as well.  We will definitely be eating here again!",

This is bad time wise, but also a good sign the food is good because if the wait on a Saturday night at 6:30pm is 10 minutes you might want to look elsewhere IMO. Our waitress Holly was very attentive and pleasant. She made some good recommendations that turned out pretty good. In short me and the wife enjoyed the food very much. The chips and salsa were very good and hard to stop eating. We will definitely go back again.",

Food was average and everyone seemed happy with what they ordered.   My biggest complaint would be that I tried to order 3-4 different drinks off their drink menu, and each time the waiter returned a few minutes later to tell me their did not have the ingredients to make it. Not being able to make a mojito or margarita in a mexican restaurant seems kinda odd.. Especially during the world cup games when business should be booming.",

The chips were light, not greasy and deliciously salty. We also ordered the chunky guacamole which was also perfect!  I got the garden enchiladas which were topped with a tasty green sauce that I highly recommend. The fiance got a duo of shrimp tacos, one fried, one grilled. Both were good, but as with most things, the fried was unbeatable.   This place makes pretty much everything in house including tortillas, chips and salsa, etc, and you can definitely taste the difference!  The service as awesome too! And so was my bloody Maria which was only $5 since it was Sunday.   We went 3 days ago and I am still amazed by how delicious the food was.",

So be careful and don't eat too much of those because you would want to save some room for your tummy. The waiter was super nice and always checked up on us. One of my friends ordered a meal but didn't know there was going to be beans in them and was willing to continue to eat it! The waiter overheard and said shed be glad to remake one without beans! Even thought my friend didn't take the offer, it just showed how incredible the service was. The tacos was so flavorful and filling. You don't think two would fill you up but it will! Just make sure you squeeze some like on the tacos to give it an extra flavor.",

    "text": "For starters, I wonder why I have only been here twice since living near by for two years? Paco's was busy during our late dinner visiting time, however both hostesses were pleasant and in good moods, took our information and then enthusiastically confirmed that it would be fine if we waited at the bar (about a twenty minute wait we were told). Before we could even order our drinks at the bar, the sweet and extremely polite hostess came up and said \"miss your table is ready\".  So that was maybe a five minute wait, if that. Nice surprise because we were both very hungry! ;)  We were seated in a booth in the downstairs corner. The ambiance is casual and warm in the seated sections allowing you the opportunity to relax, but there are also TVs at and around the bar for those who want to come and just catch a game and have a drink.  The waitress was timely, polite, and patient with my boyfriend who comically tends to take forever to choose his meal. Meanwhile, we ordered margaritas-the watermelon summer one is spectacular! Just the right amount of flavor and liquor, goes down so crisp and easy it could be dangerous. Chips and salas were ever-flowing and fresh. The only complaint here for me is that the chips were pretty salty. But I applaud the freshness of both chips and salsa, and the spice kick in the salsa is just the right amount! The salsa is the perfect texture, not too chunky and not too watery.  The menu has options for vegetarian or GF, which is what I look for now as another way to bump a review up in stars. They have veggie fajitas, fiesta bowls, veggie enchiladas, corn tortilla options, etc. I had the fiesta bowl with no protein added. It was a generous amount of food, looked lovely and colorful and the avocado was just amazing on it. Everything was cooked well and tasted fresh. My boyfriend had three tacos: turkey, beef, shrimp. He loved how they tasted with the only complaint being slightly dry. He has previously had the fajitas which remain his favorite.   Overall it is a nice dining experience with no complaints. Food is fresh, people are kind, staff works together to refill water/chips/salsa/remove plates, drinks are amazing, and they do have a cute little patio out front. This is the kind of place you keep coming back to because you know you can get good food. We will return and I look forward to trying new things on the menu each time.",

This time I called and made a reservation and we walked right in and got sat!   Their salsa is so good. We asked if they had anything spicer and they have a habanero salsa. That was delicious. I'm definitely asking for it next time.   I always get tacos with flour tortillas. No slaw with extra rice and refried beans. I'm not a big bean fan but their refried beans are the best. It's cheesy and has a smoky flavor to it. I got the beef taco, steak taco and shrimp taco. They are all loaded with meat! My favorite taco is the calamari. They only do that as a taco of the day but I would love if they bring it back!!   Service was excellent!!",

    "text": "I am always in the mood for Mexican food and Margaritas! My boyfriend and I decided to go for Restaurant Week! Once we got there we were greeted by the hosts and told It would be a few minutes, which is what we were expecting. Once we got to our table It took our waitress about 20 to come greet us, by that time a manager had stopped and asked if we needed waters while we wait. Now my boyfriend and I both work in the service industry so we understand that It happens. However, once our server (Chelly?) arrived she proceeded to ask us for our order. I ordered 3 tacos and soup, as I'm ordering she is looking around the restaurant and mouthing words across the room. She asked me to repeat myself so I did but she never once looked at me. She was very distracted. She did the same thing to my boyfriend, got his order and left. When I tell you we didn't see her again, I am not exaggerating. She never came to check on us, never refilled our waters, but we did see her doing all her side work. We're not needy people but It would have been nice to have some more water. We finally saw her when our plates were gone and she asked us if we wanted our desserts Togo or for here. We said for here and she rolled her eyes and sighed. When we received our desserts they were packaged Togo. We were very frustrated.  Now the food was AMAZING!! We both had the chicken tortilla soup, variety of tacos and one of the best margaritas I have had in a long time. For dessert we both had Tres Leches and let me say, that is my most favorite dessert of all time and they killed It. It was so good and so moist.  I would highly recommend you go here for the food, but don't expect great service!",

She and I both grew up in Charlotte so we still thought of this as Manzetti's - an awesome restaurant with a lot of memories. We were very pleasantly surprised that, despite the very different cuisine, Paco's Tacos was just as delicious and good a restaurant.  I had a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese enchilada and it was amazing. I loved the fact that it was not enormous but a perfect amount of food (so sick of all the ginormous servings, like at the Cheesecake Factory). The chips were a bit too salty but the guacamole- made fresh at the table - was wonderful and balanced it out. My wife had a margarita and it made her very happy - all I cared about. The cost wasn't bad - about $10/entree - especially given the area.   To put the cherry on top, the service was excellent. Consistent, smiling, pleasant, not wanting for anything. And the bathroom was clean and smelled fresh - a very welcome change from a lot of establishments.   Will definitely come again.",

I love their choice of drinks and my personal favourite is the jalapeno one. The staff is friendly and helpful. THeir suggestions with respect to food and drinks always proved to be nice. Every meal starts with complimentary chips and salsa and you get to choose from their list of tacos, quesadilla, burrito (both bowls and wrap) and fajitas. The menu is that of any mexican restaurant, but the flavours are really fresh and definitely mouth watering.  I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves mexican food or wants to try it out for the first time. THe price is a little bit on the higher side, but I'm not complaining , since it's totally worth it!",

The food is amazing, always fresh and they use best quality ingredients. The steak fajitas I get, outlaw fajitas is the name I think, are amazing and it's skirt steak and is such a good piece of meat sand very flavorful, always done right! The plate they give u with lettuce, sour cream, tomatoes, cheese, guacamole, and jalapenos!!!! Plus the plate is set up perfectly and not on top of each other or in a big pile, you can really see the effort bc that's not something other places do. They have queso fresco cheese here which is a must for me, I don't want queso dip, but queso fresco the white crumble cheese, it's authentic Mexican! My bf gets the taco salad or tacos, everything is good here, you really can't go wrong, the bar is great for drinks!! Best Mexican restaurant in Charlotte by far!",

And the one we chose was terrific with no next day \"hangover\" effects after two drinks, as we might have felt with traditional brands in the past. Unfortunately, that was the only time we had a server take the time to educate us and we've been there countless times since. Otherwise it's always dependably consistent.",

Well they totally nailed it, from the complementary chips and dip to the sauce stains on my napkin!  The dining area was empty and only a few people were at the bar upon my arrival for a late lunch. Adlai our server was very helpful with recommendations and was knowledgeable of the menu. I had a overstuffed grilled chicken taco which arrived with Mexican rice, mixed cabbage coleslaw and, their own, Charro style pintos, all at the incredible price of... drum roll please... 7 Bucks! My buddy tried Paco's Taco which is shredded beef and was equally as tasty. Servings are huge and everything was fantastic.   Premeal chips and salsa were delivered to the table immediately. The chips are very thin and were very fresh. The place was clean and attractive. Sanitation rating was a 95. For those long time Charlotteans like myself, you may remember this place as the old Manzetti's.  I'm going back soon! This place is a Gotta Try!.",

Your bowls of salsa and chips are constantly refilled before they even get a chance to be emptied. I've been to other Mexican restaurants that will charge you for salsa and chips, and there will not be refills.  I love that they have a separate door for to go orders. Now that I live close by, I'll definitely become a regular.",

I had the enchiladas Dennis with grilled corn and Nancy had the chicken tortilla soup/chopped salad combo.  Never have we enjoyed Mexican cuisine this much.  Add their wonderful service and this was a 10 Star experience!  Thank you, Irma....",

(Why must they act like you're bothering them?!?) We didn't want to sit outside because it was somewhat windy out - and apparently there weren't any inside tables available - so the hostess was really snippy that we wouldn't take the table outside. When we did get seated, we were happy to order margaritas and guac (both of which were DELICIOUS).... but my favorite salad was missing from the menu - (I literally used to dream of this salad it was so tasty). I ordered another and my hubs ordered tacos. His was a bit greasy when it arrived and my salad truly felt like an afterthought. The lettuce was hardly even chopped!! It was WHOLE leaves and probably could have been called a WEDGE salad since it was BIG leaves. The toppings were sparse (also not like I remembered when I was more frequent) - our chips kept coming so that made up for it I guess. I definitely left FULL of tortilla chips, salsa and guac. My salad was hardly noteworthy and my husband's tacos were weak. Hoping this was just an \"off\" day - or I'm afraid it's a sign that Paco's is on their way out. :(",

I was greeted promptly, my drink order was taken and the chips and salsa arrived quickly, always a plus.  I ordered the smokey and the brisket taco and the  fish, which comes grilled or fried. They offer a choice of tortillas, corn or flour and hard or soft tacos.  They have charro beans, refried or black.  The food was very flavorful and the portions were generous.  Two tacos with the beans and rice was a large meal.  I chose the charro beans and they were great.   If you aren't real hungry, one taco would be enough.  The only reason I am not giving this five stars was due to the follow up service from the bar.  No one asked if I wanted another drink or checked back with me once the food arrived except to drop the bill and they weren't that busy.  Still, I would recommend and return to try some of the other tacos.",

The best thing about this restaurant is what they could be in theory.  Creative tacos, great/fresh side items, housemade dressings, etc etc..But really everything is just OK in my opinion.  The tableside guacamole is incredible but that isn't enough to keep me as a repeat customer.    The smoked chicken taco was okay, a little bland.  The pulled pork taco was decent but a little tough and once again, bland.  The side options are solid considering you typically only get lard...I mean refried beans...so I did enjoy my black beans and rice!  Overall--I think Paco's is okay.  They are a good alternative to traditional Mexican places and we don't have very many \"tex-mex\" places in Charlotte so I give them credit.  I don't think they are that great but they will satisfy a craving in a pinch I suppose.",

    "text": "This restaurant claims to be accessible but that's a lie (around 75% of the seating here is on a sunken level). My husband and I tried to eat here this afternoon but ended up leaving due to the restaurant's disinterest in seating us. My husband has recently had foot surgery and is using a knee scooter since he can't bear any weight on his foot. When we arrived at the hostess station and the hostess saw my husband she excused herself and went to talk to someone else who was maybe a manager. Whoever this person was, he never came over but sent her back to ask us if my husband could navigate the stairs...he's using a knee scooter, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the answer to that one. When we said no she said we could sit outside. It was either \"navigate the stairs\" or sit outside. All this while we're staring at about 8 empty regular tables and a couple empty high top tables on the level we're on. When we declined to sit outside and said we'd go elsewhere, the hostess just said oh, ok, sorry. The person (manager) she went to talk to was standing several feet away watching this whole exchange and never once came over to offer to seat us on the ground level when it was clear we were leaving.   TLDR; Go to Chuy's!! They genuinely care about their customers and their food is much better as they serve actual Tex-Mex.",

I would recommend sticking with what you know. I ordered the cucumber margarita thinking it would be refreshing but it had a little too much cucumber flavor and pieces (kind of chunky..yuck). I then ordered the classic and it was too sweet and had too much mixer so if you don't like sweet, let them know before they make it! Drinks may have not been the best but the food was phenomenol. I recommend the combination platter becuase you get a little bit of everything! The tortillas are the best item hands down.If you get tacos, make sure to get soft tacos!! All of the food was delicious, you can't go wrong!",

It was a warm evening, and I was able to score outdoor seating for my friend and me.  We were given chips and salsa.  The salsa had nice heat, but there was something thick and sweet about it.  The menu is meat heavy.  But, I ordered the Too Big Taco Salad without meat.  Wow!  It came with greens, queso, black beans, cheese, corn shaved off of the cob, tossed in a Ranch like dressing.  It also featured tortilla chips nestled under the greens.  Kind of like eating nachos and salad simultaneously.  Very filling.  I may have finished half of it and then our server promptly removed it.  He didn't ask me if I was finished, but probably noting my diminutive size, he figured that I should be.  In retrospect, I wish that I had asked for a box.  However, it may have been one of those dishes that doesn't keep well.  The background music appeared to be mostly country.  Not to my liking, but it provably suits a Tex-Mex place. So, I had a bit of a Manzetti's salad flashback.  I think that I will I order that same dish again when I return.",

We went here on a Saturday afternoon and there were a few other patrons there (mostly with kids, it seems like a good place to bring them) and we were promptly greeted by the server. I was confused by the theme of it though. It has a menu full of Mexican food, the decor seemed more Western Route 66 -ish and the music was random as well. Being one that loves random stuff, I enjoyed it. Service was great and the manager even stopped by after to see how everything was and how we thought everything tasted and if it needed any more flavor or seasoning. I thought that was really awesome that they asked our opinion (even if they really didn't care). I got the ceviche why was served like a parfait in a dessert cup so I found that different but it tasted great as well did the chips and salsa.  Personally, prices seemed a little steep. $7 for one taco? No thanks, I can make one at home for $.80.",

Chips and salsa: Pretty yummy, and the salsa had a nice flavor and sutle heat to it.  Firestarter margarita: Jalapeno infused tequila, fresh lime juice and ginger beer. Great heat. The ginger beer gives it a very unique flavor... unlike any other jalapeno margarita I've had.   Paco's Taco: Brisket, caramelized onions and chipotle bbq sauce. The brisket full of flavor and piled high.   Turkey Club Carnitas: slow cooked shredded turkey, sliced avocado, shredded iceberg, jalapeno bacon, tomato and avocado ranch. The Yelp family was right once again. Wow, this is a great taco.  Charro beans: Don't get me wrong, I like black beans.... but I have to go with charro every time for my side.   Fajitas: Nothing beats the smell of the sizzling plate as it comes out... making all other people jealous that they didn't order it. Huge portion size and a giant plate of fresh toppings. This easily made for two meals.   I'm a huge fan of this place... and now so is my buddy Steve. He was super impressed by his first visit.",

It's not #1 on my list because it's far out, but definitely worth the drive and time.   First, I'll say I love a good margerita, a different flavored margarita (apparently from my previous review at Verde). They had a Honeydew Margarita. Pretty good. Not enough Honeydew flavor, but the alcohol content was on point. :)   Food was very satisfying. My girlfriends and I got the combination item - 1 Taco, 1 Quesidilla,and 1 Burrito. Great section of everything plus you got both rice and beans. Everything was very tasty. I got a a chicken burrito and taco and beef burrito. I'm partial to burritos mainly because I like the sauce. This one proved to be worthy,  as well. Our table also got a Guacamole and Cheese dip to share. Nothing fancy or overly superior in taste, but always a good addition when you go Mexican.   I liked that the location wasn't overall crowded either. Very steady for a week night but still space to sit with no wait. Only reason for a 4 was location being too far out and the margarita wasnt that sweet. I will be returning.",
