It has a cheerful atmosphere and the staff seems to be rather accommodating. I was told that they recently revamped the entire menu. I'm not quite sure how the menu was prior to the new one, but either way the food is great! One of the bartenders even introduced me to a \"snake bite\" (my new favorite beverage)- a concoction of Guinness and Woodchuck (cider beer). I'd definitely recommend giving Tyber Creek a try!",

I love that you can go there and have a conversation with friends, without screaming over loud music.  Except, when there is a band.  And in that case, you are singing along. Their pizza is one of the best in town too!",

I have been looking for a place that had other forms of entertainment than just people watching and I finally found Tyber Creek.  I loved the dark pub feel and how they had not only an upstairs but also outside seating.  Half of the beers on tap I had never even heard of so I decided to taste test them (and they let me!) and all but one were great!  I can't speak for what it's like on a Saturday night, but for a relaxed Sunday funday, I couldn't think of a better place to go.  Cornhole, shuffleboard, outside seating, friendly staff and patrons, and cheap yet unique beer.  Yay!  Plus the nachos weren't too bad either.",

If you were to go here  Sunday-Wednesday this place would prob receive 4 stars.  Unfortunately, this place has the most horrible clientele.  This is yuppie central, especially on Thursday nights, and the people that come to this bar just suck.  I will leave you with this story-  The last time I went there on a Thursday night (when they have $2 drafts, which is cool) a guy i went to high school with hit on me, and it was clear to me he had no idea that we knew each other.  After I reminded him, he happened to mention (while he was hitting on me) that another girl we went to high school with was upstairs waiting for him to return with her drink- this guy is a winner.  I'll admit i thought it was funny that he was such an idiot and that the girl was upstairs waiting cluelessly for him to return, but this is not the kind of behavior I want to deal with when I'm trying to drink.   So pretty much, go during their off-times for a quiet drink or some food or be prepared to deal with drunk, stupid, wannabe social climbers.",

They are also within bike riding distance from y house, so i love to just ride my beach cruiser up there drink a couple of Guinness and pedal home.   It has a True Irish pub feel with 3 different atmospheres.  1st there's the outside, perfect for most of the temperate climate in Charlotte, and on weekends they tend to have live music outside.2ND there's the first floor inside which is dark and very Irish pub-like . And 3rd there is the top level where they have live music and DJ's on occasion and mostly its just a more lively place to hang out than the 1st floor, they do have a pool table, its a little crooked and stained, but hey its only 50 cents to play.   Thursdays, like are $2 draft night where everything on draft is $2, but bear in mind this is one of their busiest nights and you will most likely have to deal with the type of crowds  Erin K. warns about, but if you're like me, that is no problem, $2 beer is good all day every day.  Tyber creek has a great great atmosphere and $2 Guinness pints everyday, beat that.",

Dark is awesome but I would have liked to see some tea lights on the bar.  We had the potato cakes and the curry fries both could have used some salt but other than that, very good. The bartender is from Ireland and she was perfect, slightly cool reception but warms up as you chat. Made us hot whiskey, delicious. We'll for sure be back.",

The upstairs is totally redone:  they \"un\"-blacked-out the windows and put frosting on it so it lets a lot more light in.... really opened up the space and also got rid of that weird \"stage\" level with the railing that had all the tvs and video games located on it.  The whole upstairs is totally one level... and is very open, inviting, airy, and chill.  There are new bathrooms upstairs as well so no more stumbling down dark stairs (you can see now!) to go use the restroom.  I asked the barkeep how long ago the renovations had been completed and she said it had been about 3 months.  They also did away with the quick bar food type menu and have a chef.  Everything is homemade and delicious (according to the bar keep).  I ended up trying the pimento cheeseburger with bacon.... man I was not disappointed by the hype that the bartender put in me while telling me about this sandwich.  The great thing is that the food is Delicious and affordable.",

Rather than wait for the Guinness to settle, I had a draft Harpoon.  Upstairs is a whole different area and yes, there is a proper bar upstairs with the usual selection of draft and bottled beers plus spirits. The two bartenders working that night were friendly but it was hard to hear anything over the rather loud music. Fortunately, we managed to escape before the DJ started spinning tunes.  Of the bars we hit during the Crawl, this was my favorite.",

We had the meat skewers, tuna tacos, a grilled chicken salad, and a pimento cheeseburger with bacon.  The salad was pretty good and basic but the chicken was great quality.  The skewer was only okay, the tuna tacos were good but not great.  My brother had the burger and enjoyed it.  He compared it to Bad Daddy's with far less grease.    The outdoor seating is great and I look forward to visiting again in the fall.  It was a big hot and probably should have sat indoors, but it was great to see the newly renovated area.    On the next visit, I'll sample the traditional irish fare.  With Big Ben across the street serving up excellent authentic English fare, I'm hopeful this one can be comparable so I can have a good Irish place to visit on a cold winter night!  ... More to come ...",

    "text": "For my girlfriend's 50th birthday, she wanted a big party with all her friends.  I called Tyber Creek a few months in advance and they reserved the upstairs bar area for me for free.  A few days before the event, I called back and ordered the medium size Party Package, which they assured me would be enough for 50 people.  I, also, asked that they be ready with 50 shots at 7pm for the birthday toast and reminded me I might want to bring a cake (Oops!)  When we got there about 6pm, they took the cake off my hands and assured me it would be brought up at 7pm.  We went upstairs to find they had the upstairs bar area set up.  We had a dedicated bartender and waitress (plus others who helped out as need be).  They clearly had already been briefed about the shot, food and cake.  And nobody went long without a drink in hand.  They started setting out the food, with hot food over sterno, plates, etc.  By the end of the night, I was pleasantly surprised that there were still a few chicken tenders and some dip left - but not much!  Good value for the money and a real pleasure not having to order any more food part way through the party.  At 7pm sharp, they brought the cake up, having already put the candles on it, along with plates, forks and a knife.  The bartender was just finished pouring the shots.  I didn't have to remind them, which was very impressive.  At the end of the night, my sweetheart managed to twist her ankle, so I whisked her away home.  It wasn't until the next day that I found out we'd left several gifts, mostly wine, at the bar.  They had put it ALL in the office and kept it safe until we picked it up.  That really says something about the honestly and ethics of the staff.  I highly recommend Tyber Creek Pub for groups of 50 or more.  Very professional and a pleasure to work with.   And having had the occasional beer there, I know it is a first rate neighborhood bar, as well.",

Then we found out that they mixed our ticket up with someone else's... they clearly had not even looked into the problem for the last hour we were asking about the food and people that were seated 45 minutes after us were receiving theirs!!  That is just laziness.  There was minimal apology from the manager and absolutely zero remorse or apology from the waitress who had clearly not done anything to advocate for us in the kitchen.  On top of that, the shepherd pie was bland and the salad was doused in dressing.  Coming out for lunch with the office and it taking over 2 hours to eat is absolutely unacceptable.

I've been here a handful of times, but actually never been inside. We sat at the bar, and lucky for us, they had Angry Orchard pints on draft for $5. That's definitely a +1 in my book. The bartenders were very nice while we sipped on our ciders and chatted. The bar was not very crowded at all around 5pm, so we didn't feel rushed to move.

Perfectly fried and fish was moist, succulent New England code. and the tartar sauce just right. Wasn't chunky and dense like a lot of places. Such flavor! Came with peas and fries, fries were decent. Very friendly waitress and food came quickly. Boyfriend enjoyed his burger but said it wasn't necessarily better than other restaurants' burgers. After tasting my fish and chips he said he would definitely order that next time. Also the music selection was on point. Found myself jammin in my seat a Few times. Since the world was iced over we did not eat outside but they have a nice outdoor seating area that would be great for warmer weather.",

    "text": "Looking for good bar food we decided to try Tyber Creek Pub.  We were greeted by a smiling hostess whom asked if we wanted to sit upstairs or down by the bar.  We decided to sit down by the bar.  The bench was incredibly uncomfortable.  But the bar area was as uncommon as any bar in any city across the country.  I excused myself to the ladies room and though tidy I was pretty grossed out with how dirty the floors (especially the corners) were.   While in the ladies room my husband ordered a Jameson on the rocks (for him) and a Jack Daniels Honey Whisky for me.  When the bartender brought the drinks over he spoke to us in his Irish accent...jokingly I told him \"Can you just talk to me all night?\"  I say it was joke because my husband was sitting with me!  He must have taken offense to it because he said \"I am married!\"  Easy Buddy - so am I - it was a total joke.  After he left it was obvious he sent another server over to wait on us.   My husband ordered a Reuben and I ordered a steak sandwich.  Our wait was not long and our food was delivered by yet another server.  My husband's Reuben was really small but he said it was tasty.  My sandwich though good - I could taste the charcoal from the grill.  Both of us were given an abundant amount of over salted fries.   Once done with our meal our plates were whisked away and our server a very sweet young lady chatted with us about Charlotte and hometowns.   The bill with drinks was a little over $35 reasonable.  However with all the great places around the Southend area - it is doubtful we will return anytime soon.",

I had the shepherd's pie and it was nice but nothing to write home about.  No rave responses from my fellow diners either.  A friend has a wheat allergy and they made a wrap without the wrapper for her with no problem.  The main problem was that it took over an hour to get our food, and the place was mostly empty when we arrived.  I shudder to think how slow the kitchen is when they're busy.  The interior is very dark, even at noon on a sunny day, so if you hate the sun, this is the place for you, but if you like to see your companions....  Overall, next time I'm taking my business elsewhere, (like the place across the street which I haven't tried yet.)",

    "text": "One of my absolute favorite pubs around Charlotte. Quaint and impossibly Irish. I frequent here often for a number of reasons:  #1: Beer. Good selection and modestly priced. Of course there are only a handful of tap, but they definitely stock some good non-commercial and local brews.   #2: Great food. I would rate it a 9 out of 10 for bar food. Potato cakes were a must for a long time but I feel they've skimped on the portion sizes lately. Love the wings, especially with the Jameson glaze! Decent burgers and chicken sandwiches. Word to the wise- don't ever order pizza from ANY Irish pub, especially if you're like me.. typical NY pizza snob.  #3: Atmosphere: Your typical Irish pub. Again, very quaint. Upstairs, downstairs, and outdoors. You can order from the bars on both levels. Low-lighted. Outside is key weather-permitting. TV's and games set up.  #4: Vicinity to uptown. Just outside the city in Southend, \"usually\" easy to get to.  #5: Events. Three words- JAMESON. WHISKEY. DINNERS. There's also live music on weekends and one of the best places to be for St. Patty's and the World Cup.   #6: Staff. I purposely saved this for last. The staff here is great. Friendly and always quick to take your order. I've never had bad service, let alone less than perfect service here.   Still taking those Yelp app coupons...",

It was phenomenal and as good as any I have ever had.  The burgers are also great as well (I can't say the same about the soggy/greasy fries, though), and definitely very flavorful....I didn't even need ketchup.  \"Don't drink the water\" - DMB...should be posted on the walls, though.  Pretty sure they use a hose out back for the ice water, so stick with soda or booze.",

Totally willing to carry drinks to the table for you from the bar...  We had a pretty large crew and we were all taken care of very well... I also enjoyed the bouncers... Well, the one upstairs, specifically... He was very sweet but I also got the distinct feeling he could headlock someone in a second, if the need arose... lol    The spicy mozzarella sticks are huge... I don't like those, but the people that had them said they were really good, so I guess they're a safe bet, if that's your thing... I had a couple of the Tyber wings with the Sweet Chili sauce and they were fairly decent for bar food... I really enjoyed their specialty shot with Bacardi 151 and a couple other things in it...  It's called the Tyber something... It was decently priced as well, so that was a plus...   One thing that was kind of lame to me is that I didn't see a purse hook anywhere in their ladies room... Maybe I missed it, but I thought those were pretty standard nowadays...  They have a really cool outdoor patio with cornhole boards, so I'm sure this place rocks fairly well in the summer...

And more recently (ex. earlier this week), I found out they have Bingo on Mondays!   Let me clarify my 4-star rating. I enjoy a good pub/watering hole. I think a lot of places in Charlotte get too packed (seriously who wants to wait an eternity to get a lousy overpriced beer?). Tyber Creek Pub is what it is: low-key spot that gets forgotten at times, and I'm glad because I can find a table and enjoy some $3 pint special.   However I wish their food is more solid. Most recently I ordered the beef skewer and I don't know if it's my fault for having it medium rare. I swear it tasted a little bad. And the soup of the day was incredibly salty, to the point of inedible.   Thus, this is not a 4-star food review. But this is a solid 4-star let's get your drink  on review. Cheers!",

They had a private party in the dining area that night, but reserved a table for us in the bar room. They could have easily told us no - first come first served! But they really went out of their way to make a great spot for us, and customer service like that deserves a positive review. The beer specials were great, and the food was really good too! I think we all ended up with fish and chips, but they were the best I have had in a while. An assortment of appetizers were also well done. Thanks for a great evening Tyber!",

    "text": "Tyber Creek Pub is a little bit tucked away off of South Blvd, but let's call it a pseudo-hidden gem. This place is great, whether you're looking for a quiet drink with friends or a wild night out on the town. Tyber Creek has a very saloon-y feel: dark with wood everywhere, if that makes any sense. There's a downstairs area that's a little more mellow, and then a raucous upstairs space, complete with its own bar and plenty of bar game fixtures (that game with the sliding things and the sawdust? you know what i'm talking about). Great music playing, great crowds, and just an overall fun vibe every time I've been in here.   Check out on a Monday or Tues if you're looking for a quieter evening. if you're looking to really throw-down, try a Friday or Saturday night and you wont be disappointed.",

The bar area is small, but very cozy & welcoming. The bottled beer is cold. I always get the fish-n-chips and it is outstanding. The fish is always fresh, cooked perfectly and is THE best fish-n-chips I have had in Charlotte. There is a regular crowd that hangs out there, but I never feel out of place! When the weather is warm, the outdoor patio area is awesome!",

    "text": "Having just returned from London and missing it, we decided to give Tyber Creek Pub a try.  Turns out, it's an Irish pub, but it fully reminded me of the English pubs we ducked into while in London.  As we soon discovered, it was a bit too much like a London pub.  It took us a few tries to realize that there is no real waiter service in London pubs.  You order from the bar and then someone brings your food out to your table, if you're lucky enough to find one.  Tyber Creek wasn't much different.  After waiting a little while, we discovered that we had to order our food from a little window and it was brought out to us.  Like London pubs, the menu was VERY limited and the food was just average, and the place was a little dingy with an obvious bar/musty smell.  If you're in the mood for something extra casual and just feel like standing around drinking, I guess it could be fun.  Me?  After working so much, I like to relax, sit down, and be served some delicious food in a fun and/or relaxing, clean atmosphere.  I can't find all that at Tyber Creek.",

We went exploring upstairs and found a completely different scene up there.  Comparing the two, it felt like a slightly older crowd downstairs, and a younger crowd upstairs.  To me, the upstairs was reminiscent of fraternity parties I used to go to in college, if that gives any sort of mental image.    The band was great, but it was SO LOUD.  As in, ears ringing the next day, LOUD.  Maybe it's a sign of me getting older (and in that case, I maybe should have stayed downstairs?), but it seemed kind of ridiculous to have it as loud as they did.  Beer selection was good.  We had fun.  Even if I didn't hear a single word anyone said the entire night.",

You definitely run the risk of the following: drunk idiots who are all wearing the same thing (polo shirts and khakis or plaid shorts), a crowded bar, and the potential to lose your voice talking to the people you are with due to the LOUDNESS of the place, both downstairs and upstairs where DJs and bands play. I also enjoy the outside area, which is where I like to head when the weather is nice.  If you can handle all of that, you are likely to enjoy yourself, as there is good music, $2 Guinness draughts, and a great place to observe funny drunken behavior.  Definitely a younger clientele, similar to that of Angry Ale's. Not the type of place I want to frequent, but an amusing and sometimes fun place to hit up every now and then.",

You can always bet on a good mix of people who are either enjoying the pints of Guinness or the pool table and dance floor upstairs.  You can't go wrong in a place where they actually know how to correctly pour a Guinness.  I always like to get a \"snakebite\" which is Harp and Cider mixed together.  It's refreshing and sweet but after about two it's a little overwhelming.  For a long time, this was our neighborhood bar.  We would usually show up after dining hours strictly to party, and that we did, and that we will continue to do.",

    "text": "A group of 6 of us wanted to enjoy some Irish fare on St. Patrick's Day so my brother found Tyber Creek Pub for us to try.  The parking sitiation was pretty dicey but we did all find spots.  They had a tent up for a band and plenty of outside seating.  There was a bit of a nip in the air so we were seated inside- no wait.  We were ushered to the upstairs to a hightop that we kinda had to squeeze into.  The waitress brought us water in a large bottle and small glasses so we could hust pour what we wanted.  We had a couple that would have liked a go at the dart board but one group monopolized it the entire time we were there.  We placed our orders and it was a fairly lengthy wait but we were in good company so it wasn't too bad.  When the orders did come out, only one was incorrect and had to be sent back-my son is not a big cheese eater and his burger, ordered with only catsup and onions, came covered in cheese.  When it came back, they had only wiped off most of the cheese.  We just let it go as we didn't want to spend our entire day there but it did tick me off and he didn't eat much of his burger.  This is why I didn't give them 5 stars.  My fish and chips tasted very good as did my fries.  I particularly liked the tarter sauce.  Can't pinpoint what exactly was in it but it was good.  2 in our party ordered the Shepherds pie and said it was delicious.  My brother got the corned beef and cabbage and raved about how well it was cooked.  One got bangers and mash and judging by the clean plate, she very much enjoyed it.  Our waitress kept our glasses full and was pretty attentive especially as busy as they were.  I would go back but would have handled the burger situation differently.  I would definitely insisted on a new burger.",

My 1st time to this Pub and I will NEVER come back thanks to the horrible bat service and pouring a lower price scotch for a top shelf one....I do work in the restaurant business and I have NEVER seen Women ignored like I did the other night !

    "text": "You're out on a Saturday night and you're not ready to call it a night.  \"Just one more drink!\"  \"Food sounds so good right now!\"  This was me last weekend.  With all the places to go in South End, I was really just looking for a place with good food and beer that wasn't crowded with standing, drunk people.  I wondered into Tyber Creek Pub and since it was well past dinner time, there was no issue getting a table outside.  This place has a fun atmosphere.  They can accommodate large groups with their community tables (or smaller 4-tops if you don't feel like being social with anyone but the friends you came with).  Everyone looking like they were having a good time hanging out and watching the game, so it made for a nice, friendly, casual atmosphere.  The waitress I had was excellent.  I can never tell if I'm going to get good pub food or a greasy mess, but she gave us some pretty decent recommendations.  I tried the salad, the spinach dip and the sausage plate.  Overall, food wasn't totally out of this world, but based on what I had and the clean plates I saw around me, it's a pretty solid place to get a bite to eat.  If you looking to halfway watch a game, have some beer/apps, and hang out with friends, I would throw Tyber Creek Pub on your list of places to go.",

The black and white pudding - well the servings should not have even been plated one was maybe the size of a quarter in circumference or diameter.  I thought rasher came with the meal should've asked but there was no rasher. This is a common component of an \"Irish\" breakfast. I ordered the corned beef hash with sunny side up egg - yoke cook to solid state. Personally,  I would not come here for food ever again.   Yes they gave us a free Guinness but that does not make up for a terrible meal.",

Trust me, it's not as easy as it sounds and SO many places screw it up.  There's a process, it has to settle, you need a rich creamy head on top.  Most bartenders in CLT pour the suckers in 30 seconds or less and the difference in taste is huge.  The bar is comfortable and the patrons are an interesting mix.  If you want a proper Guinness then this is the place.",

I will definitely give the food a shot soon. Overall, Tyber is a great hangout in Southend, and don't forget to go upstairs, on the weekends you can enjoy some good music and dancing!",

    "text": "After a late brunch at Tyber I feel like my previous review needs to be updated. I had such an excellent meal that I will write off the cabbage experience as an unfortunate mishap.   Since dating a Brit I have completely adopted one aspect of his culture - the full English Breakfast. Now at Tyber Creek it is an Irish Breakfast but it is basically the same thing. They definitely have this meal down perfectly. I especially liked that they let me sub extra rashers instead of the puddings (one white and one black). I almost never try to sub out at restaurants but #sorrynotsorry I just can't get past how they make black pudding. Now instead of having a plate with food I wasn't going to eat I had extra delicious English style bacon. AT NO EXTRA CHARGE. I must highlight that point because I am sure rashers are a speciality item and across the street at Big Ben they charge $2.25 just for a single extra Yorkshire pudding. Tyber Creek gets major bonus points for this small free substitution. My love can be bought with bacon.  The waitress and bartender were very attentive throughout the whole meal. Now it isn't really a brunch place but somewhere you can get a hearty English Breakfast until late in the day and it was so delicious we will definitely return.",

My friends Guinness and Jameson ensured the day was successful and that our tournament was not.  What I've liked about Tyber Creek on my several visits is that it has the dark, heavy feel that an Irish pub should have. This is also why you see so many good looking Irish girls with busted looking guys. Major kudos to the men of Ireland!  The beer and whiskey selection satisfy my tastes...and the food isn't too bad either. There are three completely different vibes to Tyber: the daytime...grabbin' food and tippin' one or two...the nightime...\"this is how we do it\"...and the weekend...\"all caution to the wind\"  All three of which are fun and inviting given the mood you're in.  Tyber Creek is a fun time with great service, great drinks and fun people. If you haven't made it Southward...maybe you should.  Try: an Irish Car Bomb  Avoid: domestic beer",

The one consistent theme: I always have a good time.. day drinking, after work cocktails, a place to kick off the evening or to end a blurry night.  What can you expect? The place is dark. The patio is pretty spectacular. The bartenders know how to pour a Guinness correctly. I don't drink the stuff (unless it's in the form of a car bomb), but I give them props for doing it right. It's insane here for St. Patrick's Day. Tyberpalooza is super fun. What is that? An annual two day event that happens every CIAA weekend. Live music, flip cup and cornhole tourneys. They bring in a big ass heated tent for it.  Typically, we come here just to drink. When I do need to order food, I usually go with pizza. I like the Tyber Old School. Buffalo sauce, grilled chicken, ranch = a trio that I will always enjoy. They do brunch on Sundays with a bloody mary bar.   I've left my car here several times overnight and it has been fine when I come pick it up the next day. Take that for what it's worth. If you drink, don't drive. Check points are no stranger to South Blvd, especially near 277 and uptown.",

    "text": "Prime patio dining here. They have a great setup with a mix of outdoor booths and tables. They also have games and live music. Looks like they also have heaters for when it's chilly. Did not even venture inside.   Great tequila special on Thursdays, which you can also order a margarita with at a discounted price. Had to have a Guinness while I was here too. Of course.   Started with the spinach dip (half off thanks to Yelp!). Honestly one of the best spinach dips I have had. Next time I will get with the pita instead. After much debate between pizza and reuben I went with the Reuben...because lets be honest I wanted fries. When it came out I thought the portion was a little small, but I only ended up eating half anyway with the spinach dip app. Great flavor and loved the fries too!   Our service was not great, empty drinks for quite a while, but I think our waitress was new.   Great spot in South End for dinner and/or drinks!",

This food was very authentic completely surprised on the quality of the food. And on the Taste they have madea customer of me for life.        Also using bite. Delivery service for the first time. From now on I will use this delivery. Service the Delivery fee is very reasonable very reasonable in accuracy in time was amazing. The delivery person was very efficient and very friendly",

    "text": "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Tyber Creek Pub in the Historic South End of Charlotte.  Dora here. Isn't this the coolest looking building? I love the brick exterior and this pub has been on my radar for some time, specifically for the Shepherd's Pie. The dark interior screamed bar and outside of two or three tables inside, the only seating appeared to be the outdoor patio. Wouldn't recommend bringing the kiddos for dinner.  For my lunch, I chose the Reuben with a side of hand cut fries. This sandwich was very good and loaded with moist corned beef, sauerkraut, and melted cheese on toasted bread. The bread stood up to this juicy sandwich and never became soggy.  Dora here. We visited on a Saturday for lunch and, if I'd done my research, I would've known that they only offer their limited Brunch menu on the weekends. Bummer since I was looking forward to Shepherds Pie. Instead, I opted for the Tyler Creek Pub Burger. A good burger, but nothing jazzed my taste buds. The French Fries were fabulous. Tasty and not greasy at all, these hand cut sticks almost made up for the unimpressive burger.  We rate this restaurant 3 forks out of 5 for a friendly restaurant serving good food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

The wait staff was friendly and efficient. We arrived about 4 pm and they had traditional Irish music, for about the next 15 minutes, and that was the good part of the day. It was all  downhill from there. For the next two hours there was no Irish music, no Irish dancers, at least outside in the tent, where we had stayed. Then the DJ was setting up for about 45 minutes. My wife asked the DJ if he were going to play Irish music and he just smirked. When he started we were hoping for Irish music but alas that was not the case. He played dance music but no Irish music (there was one U2 song-to be fair). We luckily had time to call our other friends, who were on their way, and change our plans and met at another location. Tyber Creek is supposed to be an Irish bar and at least for the St Pats weekend we expected more but got less of the Irish cheer.",

Take it down to my server HANNAH and told her it has onions on it, she goes into the kitchen and gives it to the cook who smirks reaches over with his barehands pulls the knife out of the burger reaches over deconstructs the burger, puts the bun back on and sticks the knife back in it. Now I am furious, Hannah comes out the door to the kitchen gives me the burger, and I then ask for the manager HEATHER, the allergy issue and what the cook did. Heather said she understood and she would comp the meal. Thanks!? So I come back upstairs to tell the wife they are re-firing the burger, when I think to myself if lack of integrity in the kitchen, ran back down to have the manager watch him make the burger so nothing unprofessional would happen, she said the head chef was making it. It came up bland and tasteless.  We won't be back for food if at all.  Right now I am still shaking I am so upset. Still tried to keep the review professional. I just can't trust them to do right when I am not looking, my personal opinion.",

The reuben at Tyber is unbelievable and a must-try spot if you're looking for a great reuben around the Queen City.  The corned beef was the first thing you notice - thick, clearly hand-carved cuts off a meat clearly done in-house. This was far from the deli meat served on most reubens around Charlotte. It tasted like St Patty's Day inside the surrounding rye bread. The kraut was fantastic, adding that pickled flavor a reuben requires, and the cheese was flavorful enough to be enjoyed in each bite. The bread was the only thing about the reuben that didn't stand out, and something other than standard marbled rye (something locally baked maybe?) would have made this reuben perfect. The experience was great and without a doubt I'll be back to enjoy another reuben from Tyber.",

He's against diversity and doesn't play anything but complete American music. The DJ is racist and gives attitude to anyone that doesn't look white at all. I would only recommend this place if you're into places that are not diverse.",

One main meal was never put in and after finally getting the attention of the server, waiting 30-45min, to address this issue the order had to be switched as take out because it took that long. This meant not eating with my group for which I am very upset. Service had to be waved down for attention. By the end, I had to wave payment just to pay. With this little attention on thier tables or concern for payment, if this happens again, I will walk out.    It was embarrassing to have invited friends to dinner here. I was not expecting this due to other ratings. Not sure if this is due to being a Friday night.  I would not recommend coming here to eat on Friday nights.   In regards to food, the artichoke dip, potatoes leek, and bangers was good. Shepard pie was not impressive but not sure if it was due to it being put for take out. It looked like slop.",

The staff crumbled in front of us and made all patrons feel extremely uncomfortable. The GM was fired under a spotlight on the second floor, our food runner complained to me about his wages, and our waitress mentioned to us that another waiter had just told her to \"f*uck off\"..... We never wanted to be caught up in the awful, petty reality show called Tyber Creek Pub, we just wanted to catch up amongst our friends and have an enjoyable dinner.  I will never eat or drink here ever again, but if you love drama, terrible service, and sub-par food, it's a must-visit.",

I like the outside seating and they have standard bar games outside (cornhole, jenga). There's also an upstairs with a bar and additional tables and TVs. I've only ever had two items off the food menu, but both were pretty good! I had a standard burger and the spinach and artichoke dip. I really liked the dip, especially the bread/crackers that it comes with! Living close also makes it a go to spot for me!",

It's quiet, the music is mellow and you can shoot the shit with the Bartenders while enjoying your drink. On weekends it gets a little bit more rowdy, with live music and DJ's upstairs.  But the biggest draw is the staff. I would definitely recommend getting to know these guys and girls, as they are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet. They know how to mix a mean drink and are always very welcoming.  This has become my go to bar for some time now, and I don't see that changing any time soon.",

I don't normally spend a whole ton of time in the South End (although I'd love to start... in fact, I think I will start now! ready, go!), so when a CMYE popped up for this location, I decided to give it a try.  Our get together was upstairs, and we had a dedicated bartender there, along with waitresses, so we were never out of drinks, which was awesome.  I'd love to come back here and try the food, it looked pretty good (and the samples of hummus, garlic dip, and tapenade were delish!).  I like the atmosphere here, it's quiet enough upstairs that you could hold a conversation, and there is ample space to sit or stand around.  Plenty of TVs too!  One thing, though... maybe get some new barstools?  It was not fun for this short person to hoist herself up onto a barstool by the bottom rung of the stool, only to have it break off and send me reeling and spilling my drink everywhere.  It was a good conversation starter in a sea of strangers, but, I mean, I spilled my drink.  Other than the drink-spilling, though,  good times!! Need to come back and play some cornhole outside!!",

Going out drinking should not be that hard.    The bright sides: $2 drafts on Thursdays. And It's right off the light rail, so if you're coming from uptown or farther south you can take public transit there. If you live in South End or Dilworth, Tyber Creek is probably within walking distance for you, which is another perk.",

It was very busy so we were lucky to be seated with a table outside on the patio that had just opened up.  Our server told us in advance that there was a wait for food which we gathered by how busy it was. We were happy to enjoy a couple Guinness pints while we waited, it was certainly worth the wait and the best fish and chips I have had in a long time! My boyfriend got the Reuben and two others got the bangers and mash & corned beef to share, everyone was happy with their meal and our servers suggestion of Irish coffees as desert went down a treat!  We stayed into the afternoon as the atmosphere was great and despite how busy it was we were well taken care of and returned with a large group for the Irish band the following night. We did not eat but were at the bar and had a nice cocktail with Jameson in it, I can't remember the name but I'll be having it again next time for sure!",

    "text": "Don't go here if you want to have a quiet conversation on a weekend night.  As ususal with a quick review of my fellow Yelpers, I wonder if we were at the same place. How certain is the truthy quote, ' it's all in the eye of the beholder'.  I was interested in this place because I heard they were serving $3 Imperial Pints of Guinness, which they are. It's also the site of place I used to frequent back in the late 70's called the Olde Quarter. Bill Hannah played regular gigs there as well as a host of other local & regional bands...Dixie Dreggs and Spectrum. There was a fire in 82 or 83, the place closed down and I know it's been several bar/restaurants since and has been in it's current incarnation for about 10 years.  Back to the Guinness topic. It's a nice clean and fresh pour and certainly a good value at $3 for an imperial pint which at 20 oz is four ounces more than the standard US pint.  The music....a nice mix of U2, Kinks, Steely Dan, Foo Fighters, Radiators...you get the idea...but loud...loud...loud. Way too loud to have a 'quiet conversation' as another Yelper suggested.  Went on a Sat evening, the downstairs was open, the upstairs was closed. It does have a Pub feel to it, dark and lots of wood, signs advertising specials and various bands.  There's a host stand but no one to greet us at 730p on a Sat evening. There's a good sized bar and many raied round table tops on the floor of the bar...some with stools & some with wood backed chairs. We took a seat and sat for about five minutes with no server in sight. I then went to the bar and orderd some beers and asked for food service.  Within 5 minutes we had a server who was cordial and nice. I asked about the music and she smiled and said \" do you like it\", to which I responded \"yes, but isn't it a little loud\"...she smiled even bigger and replied...\"are you kidding, it's quiet compared to what it's usually like\".  If you don't mind asking your companion to repeat themselves after every sentence or are good at giving and reading sign language then you shouldn't have a problem. Otherwise I would suggest going when it's warmer when you can sit outside. There were a couple of 42 inch plasmas tuned to ESPN...fortunately with the sound turned down  We both had burgers which were better than average. They have a good selection of  pub grub fare. The couple beside has the wings which they both raved about. They also suggested the Rabbit Food appetizer which we orded and I'll admit was fresh & tasty, carrots, cucumbers and celery sticks along w/Ranch dressing...a little pricey IMO at $6.50 but...it was fresh.  Upstairs is a bar with a 52 inch plasma, pool tables & some dart boards. I'm guessing on a busy nite that's where most people go if they don't care for the downstairs.   I would guess that if the place has managed to stay in business for 10 years, it's because of the affordable draft beer selection & the location. It's proximity to Dillworth & South End.  Go for the beer and take someone you don't care to  to have a quiet conversation with.",

The food has always been decent (especially for midnight fare), the bartenders have always been great, but walking upstairs was a disaster. I never noticed a seating problem before, but apparently the owners did... oddly enough, the high tables were still busy as usual, but all of the booths sat empty. Only once the upstairs bathroom line grew too long did people start to occupy the nearest cushion. Also, instead of people being able to gravitate to a high top away from the stairwell like they used to, they were stuck standing right near the stairs (or the bathroom) and walking from one side of the upstairs to the other was more hassle than needed be.   Tyber has definitely dropped on my list of near-home stop ins, but on an off night where I think it'll be slow enough I don't have to head upstairs for a seat, I'll probably be back.",

They were all written in one run on sentence like paragraph using commas to separate them so i really couldn't say how many drafts they had. i know i had Big Boss Blanco Diablo and a $3 Guinness.  Thursday is $3 pint night for all drafts i believe, but everyday is $3 Guinness day.  i went with the buffalo chicken sandwich which apparently comes with a super sized  extra large amount of fries. Plain old fries that could use some love from a seasoning salt of some sort. The buffalo was decent and the chicken was a hearty portion.  Overall, i liked our service and meal. Can't say i'd recommend coming solely for the meal, unless you come armed with the Entertainment coupon then it is definitely worth trying (bogo entree) or if you are longing for an authentic pub feel and are going to have some drinks. (i've never been to a real pub, but it seems authentic),  i imagine we'll venture back if for nothing else to use the 2011 Entertainment Book coupon.",

They spiced things up a little with some mood lighting from the candles placed on every table and all along the bar.  I also liked the selection of music they were playing and it was at just the right volume.  We each ended up ordering the buffalo chicken sandwich and fries.  The sandwich tasted pretty good and it was actually sufficiently covered in buffalo sauce.  Add some blue cheese dressing and it hit the spot.  The fries were practically overflowing off my plate.  Unfortunately the fries tasted just like the kind we make at home in the frozen bag.  They had a decent draft beer selection (maybe 10 or so beers) but we came on a night without specials, with the exception of the daily $3 Guiness pint.  We ended our evening by playing some photo hunt at the bar.  I'm easily entertained.  I would come back here to hang out on a weeknight and grab a couple beers, preferably on a night with drink specials.",

This past weekend wasn't much different, however I will say it's lost some of it's charm. Tyber Creek has been remodeled a few times in the years that it's sat on it's quaint little corner. Every time it gets remodeled I feel a little of it's charm is lost and it's trying to get too upscale. That's just a personal preference though since I've been coming here for a long LONG time. Also the menu is a bit sad. Not a lot to choose from when it comes down to it. So in our group (at least what I tried) we had a pub burger (not bad but the bread was rather hard on the bottom), a chicken sandwich (okay but nothing special) and the steak kabobs which were amazing and what I'd order the next time I come in. The fries were good as well. I also tried the chocolate cake which was okay but why why why must every single piece of chocolate cake be covered in ganache instead of frosting?? Sigh... Anyways service was great, we watched the game and that was a great experience. After the game the DJ started up and he was decent enough; played a lot of old school stuff which was cool. All in all I'm giving 4 stars rather than 5 because the food just wasn't great and their menu is super small.",

The barkeep was great and after about a dozen pints I probably would have proposed to her at least a dozen times but alas the warm beer was the wedge in our potential relationship.   I was informed that during the heat of the summer jungle months that the beer comes about a bit tepid! NOOOOOOOOO! What did that beer do to you!??!! Plus you are pissing away profits in foam! What a shame since the Irish in me hoped and yes prayed I found the promised land of drinking...I will be back in the fall when the temps die down!",

We ordered six items and half of them didn't show. The staff is a mess and the food mediocre. It's a damn pub and they were out of fish and chips... What!? The outdoor area is fun and the DJ is great but you should eat dinner at a decent restaurant beforehand. You've been warned. Too bad negative stars aren't an option.",

    "text": "This is what a neighborhood bar should be, providing a comfortable atmosphere in the bar downstairs, a place to eat quietly upstairs, and an unrivaled patio to pass the many beautiful nights we get here in the Queen City.  The remodel Tyber went through about a year and a half ago did change the atmosphere a bit.  They went from a True bar, dark as midnight even at noon inside, a bit more light was brought in and some more space made downstairs.  I admit, I do miss the days of the $2 Guinness, but this is still once of my favorite places to grab a pint and a bite.",

    "text": "Beautiful spot in a beautiful part of town.  Drove by this place a couple of time and I got really curious about it.  This looks like a beautifully restored brick building which may have been an office building at one time.  Downstairs is appears to be more of a bar type area where drinking rules.  There is a second story where it appears to be more of a dining area.  There is also an outdoor patio area which really looks with about 10 tables which really looks like a nice place.  Ate on the second floor dining area.  The decor is pretty much the basic Irish Pub look, dark wood bootsh, wood floorks, kind of a dark atmosphere that was brightened by sunlight shining through the windows.  The menu is very basic barfood with an irish slant to it.  My freind had fish and chips and I had a cheeseburger.  To be honest, I wouldn't be drawn here by the food, but it wouldn't keep me away either.  Food was good.  Best part part about this place is that it's got this great atmosphere that's relaxing, you have a good selection of beers and you can have food or snacks thats satisfying.  To me thats worth a return trip or two.",

It was pretty empty when we got there (at around 9:30pm), but the sheer size of our group got the place hopping. Those stairs can be slightly treacherous if you've had a couple of the on special drinks. The downstairs bar area is dimly lit and probably a good place to just sit and drown your sorrows with alcohol...but that's sad, so don't do that.   For future reference: At about 2 blocks from the East/West Blvd light rail stop, it's a perfect distance for a crawl. And with a ton of bar games, a great place to spend more time at.",

Not sure what's kept me from going, maybe I think I had the feeling it was a little neighborhood joint and it's not IN my neighborhood or something.    Either way, this is a pretty cool, sort of outdated, friendly bar.  Irish bar with plenty of great and cold beers on tap as well as an appetizer and bar menu that can compete with the best of them.  Friendly bartenders keep the drinks coming and it's not hard to tell why people like this place.  It is definitely a come as you are kind of place and I like that.",

It looked like we were the first ones there at 12 on a Saturday, a little strange but who cares when you are sat quickly and the beer comes out quicker. The service was great Our waitress Lauren was attentive and she chatted with My mother in law and Aunt about her trips to Europe. My mother in law in heading there in September. Our food came out quick but not so fast as we couldn't enjoy drinks. The food was hot and fresh and cooked right, we sat outside in the patio area and they had fans on and with the breeze it was not to hot to be out in the sun. After we paid the tab we checked the games they had two cornhole setups and giant jenga. This place would great for happy hour with all that to keep busy. i will definitely be back and bring a crowd to enjoy everything they have to offer.",

A larger group of us came this weekend and had a phenomenal time. Everyone was happy with their food. NO complaints. I had the blackened chicken/goat cheese sandwich and it was actually blackened (unlike some places) the seasonings were amazing and so delicious. Everything was exactly how we ordered.  The only complaint I have is that we were seated and then told we had to move because another party had reserved the section. It wouldn't have been a problem had we been told that when we arrived. The least that could have been done was a free app.",

    "text": "I've heard great things about this place, so it's possible that my expectations were too high and therefore I was slightly disappointed.   I arrived on a Tuesday evening, around 5:30 and the place was completely empty. I wasn't looking to party so that was entirely fine. It was pretty warm outside so I chose to sit inside at the bar while I waited for a friend to show up. First of all, the inside was SO dark...which isn't good or bad, just interesting. After a few minutes of the bartender staring at me while talking to some guy - who didn't seem like he worked there but was standing behind the bar with her -she reluctantly came over to take my order. I ordered a glass of wine, and she sighed, grabbed a wine glass, and continued her discussion with random-behind-the-bar-guy with my wine glass in hand all the while wiping it down with some dish rag. Like...is it dirty....? Wet...? Anyway finally she poured some wine in it and I thanked her and paid. I took a sip and then looked up to see that the bartender and random-behind-the-bar-guy were standing DIRECTLY in front of me staring as I drank my wine while continuing their conversation. I felt awkward so obviously I thought I will pretend to be doing something on my phone...nope, no service. The entire scenario was so strange and uncomfortable I found a hostess and asked to be seated outside.  The hostess was delightful and after a while my friend arrived and we were served by an incredibly sweet girl (I believe her name was Brittany?) and I really enjoyed the rest of my time there.  I guess my advice is if you come here do not expect good service at the bar.......get a table.",

I love the atmosphere of a pub (opposed to a bar).  The dark wood everywhere and the focus on good beer and good friends (instead of trying to be a restaurant/dance hall/bar).  Upstairs is more seating and another full bar with drafts, bottles, and spirits. They do food as well, but did not sample any on my first visit.  It seems like they take a stab at being Irish, with Guinness and a few other Irish staples on draft, but only a few selections on the menu.  As others have mentioned, the music can be a little on the loud side.  But, at least they play DECENT music, something that fits with the atmosphere and the menu.  Fun hangout place that I'll certainly return to.",

Beyond the nicely put together two floors, spacious bars and plenty of seating, Tyber offers a really sweet patio. Whether you care to enjoy a Guinness after work or are itching to play some cornhole, this is a perfect place to do so. Bartenders are friendly and the overall vibe is relaxed and easy. Bonus points for great daily drink specials!   As for the eats, the menu also received a fairly nice redo as well! I was particularly fond of the pesto dip to go along with the fresh and toasty pita triangles. While the spicy cheese sticks sounded scrumptious, I kept hoping that my next bite would be spicier. That just gives me more of a reason to come back and try a few more apps!",
