Ordered Black & Bleu burger, medium, came out well done and dry. Bun toasted but cold. Small sprinkle of Bleu Cheese, 1 tomato slice and 1 thick piece of Romaine lettuce with rib still in? Couldn't eat it. Also ordered Turkey Club on croissant. Turkey very thick slice, like pre-sliced lunch meat. Manager said that's the way they slice it here and it's not going to change!  I have been in the food service industry for 37 years, would not recommend Hef's to anyone!",

Some items are decent, while others are very lacking.  The worst is selling Kraft macaroni and cheese as a selection.  I don't know about you, but I think that is nasty.    My suggestion to you as a potential customer is don't bother...not worth it.",

Standing at the bar waiting for over 30 minutes for a to go order they said would take 15 (when I called 15 mins ago from my car). Lots of inebriated patrons in the bar and music blaring louder than I have heard maybe ever in a bar. We walked over to the restaurant area to wait but it's not helping... jury is out on how long it will take to get the order. (It was wings... that doesn't take long).",

I ordered the steak tips for dinner and loved that too.  It was served with rice, vegetables and a hibachi style sauce.  The food AND the prices are outstanding!  I will be back for more.",

First, there were plenty of large TVs, and, importantly, the seating was such that you were squarely in front of your game of choice.  Second, the variety of items on the menu was impressive, running the gamut from burgers through very decent oriental dishes.  Third, the prices were quite reasonable--two dinners, two beers, one soft drink, and my 20% tip collectively came to $25.",

When they came they sat with us and the waitress came back to take their order but they had just sat down and we're looking at the menu. She never came back?? We asked the hostess to send her over because they had been waiting for a while to order. A different waitress came said our other waitress had left and didn't know where she went?? This one was good and friendly but she was running all over the place. Food is really good though that's the reason for the 3 stars. But be prepared to wait around.

I contacted the restaurant on 5/31/2016 to discuss the transaction. The Manager \"Kristen\", didn't even bother to research my transaction before immediately offering to refund the additional charge/tip. Kind of makes me wonder if this is a standard business practice. The food is decent. So I am not discouraging anyone from patronizing Hef's. If you eat at Hef's, use CASH!",

I usually just deal with the mess when I order nachos to go, but he was the one that suggested multiple containers. Awesome,  because I didn't want to be the jerk asking for all that. Picking up the order was pleasant as well. The bartender was polite and friendly and came back to me several times to assure me my food was being prepared and packed. The biggest plus of all, though?

Unenthusiastic waitress took forever to mosey on by only to say \"huh....so they didn't bring the nachos out first?\"....upon which I said \"makes no difference, I've had no plates for 10 minutes and counting\".  Also got no carrots for the wings which we explicitly asked for instead of celery.  The nachos had ground beef added...which was a crumbled up hamburger patty...which was excellent......made the nachos awesome....shoulda got a hamburger.  The wings sucked.  Overly hard......probably were sitting cold and unsauced then thrown back into fryer once ordered.  They were smaller than I like and the sauces were *MEH*......very lightly sauced and no personality in the flavor (chipotle bbq tasted like Kraft BBQ sauce).  Took forever to get a refill on my Coke.  All the waitresses and runners I saw seemed kinda scrungy (think dirty bar in NODA) and spent too much time congregating in the doorway to the kitchen on their smartphones or gossiping with one another.   Overall this place was disappointing.  The menu was wonky, had a whole page of Asian inspired dishes...which make no sense at a place like this.  The wings sucked and considering Buffalo Wild Wings is right down the street.....save your money and go there.  Hef's was great over at the Woodlawn shopping center.....this location missed the boat.",

We went on Thursday night, hoping to beat the weekend crowds, and found it still fairly busy, so the word is out.

They have lots of TV's and a decent looking bar. They had $1 Buds as part of their  grand opening specials. I tried the hot buffalo wings and they were decent. They didn't give me a lot of celery compared to boardwalk billies or bww but the price was fair.  The service was a little slow with the bartenders disappearing for a few moments at a time. Overall though as long as these guys have better service than boardwalk or bww, they have a chance to be successful.",

    "text": "I have to say I'm disappointed with Hef's. We've gone there quite a few time and the food and service was always good. Based on our history there I would have given them a 4 . ( I really wish we could do 1/2 stars.) The last time we went the service was good but the food seemed to be heading in the wrong direction. Not bad, just not as good as it was before. That was until we got our wings. There in the center of the pile was a flat with the tip still attached and ALL of the feathers we still on it! Gross!  We went again tonight, because the have a chicken avocado salad that we both like. Every time I ordered it in the past I always felt like it should have a nice chunk of bread with it. That was the only negative. Tonight, it all went to hell!  Our waitperson took our order and left in a reasonable time. It didn't appear they ahd any other tables as they weren't that busy. After we ordered our salad we decided we'd try the wings again, but...no waiter. After 5 or 10 minutes, they finally showed up. We ordered the wings and waited on our salads. When they cam they both looked good, but...The greens and  cukes were in HUGE chunks. The lettuce pieces we a foot long. I mean it was really hard to eat and guess what? No knives! The chicken was hard and dry as a bone. Even with a chunk of tomato, it was still dry and flavorless. The blue cheese was in big chunks (good), but didn't look like blue cheese. I was pure white (bad) The dressing was lacking in flavor, too. Overall a real disappointment. Oh, yea, back to the service...tick tock still waiting for the server to get a knife. Finally after the wings were ready (they said in 5 minutes, but it turned in to 15) we got to ask for a knife. The wings must have been ready in five, but not the server cause they were not hot. When you can pick up a wing and bite into it and not burn your tongue, you know they have been sitting a while. They were ok, not great. The server did not check in on us 1 time, only to take our order, deliver it and bring our check, except when we waved them down They asked me then if I wanted more coke.  I don't know if management is on vacation, they got a new chef or what, but I'm going to think twice before we visit again. One bad night (even feathers) ok, we all have off nights, but this looks like a trend. Unfortunately, the wrong way. I hope I'm wrong because we really did like the food there before!",

I wish they had renovated more, it basically feels the same as when it was O'Charley's back the day (except now they have a bajillion TVs AND a giant Bud Light neon!!).  The bar was packed, so we got a table even though we were just getting drinks and snacks. The beer list is just ok - again I wish they would add some more local breweries. Hef's can you hear me? (if you can, please add some OMB).  For our food, we tried the nachos and wings. The nachos are a solid \"good\" - tri colored chips, not greasy and topped with queso,  a \"black bean chutney\" and the other usual suspects. The wings were better than most places - meaty and lots of flavor options. We did half hot (which was manageable, no sweating) and BBQ Honey Hot. They happily brought extra celery, although I can't remember if there was a charge or not.  The place was slammed this particular Friday night. Our waitress was very very nice, but she was so in the weeds. Luckily we weren't in a hurry...I actually felt bad for how overly busy she was. I noticed a couple tables having issues and the manager appeared to be taking care of it, so that's good.   Clearly there are some things I'd love to change about Hef's, but I'm still going to give them another shot, mainly because it's so convenient!",

Terrible location for the bar in the restaurant by the way- but they bought the building as is.  The wrap was very good. Opted for chips and salsa side. Salsa was good and tasted fresh (I wonder if they made it? ). Never understood why multi-color tortilla chips are used ever- these were red, white and blue.  I'll probably come back in an evening to try the fried oysters out.",

She said that's only for the wings! Huh? Steamed wings? I said on just bring me the oysters. Then when I asked for horseradish sauce she practically threw it at me. I have never been treated so bad by a waitress in my life. I always tip. Even if it is a Chinese buffet  If they are nice and refill my tea. I leave a tip. I did not leave this girl a tip.

The food is decent, but the menu could use some work. The place has a hard time deciding what it is, offering Thi dishes and steak next to wings and burgers. They also need to add more and better apps, especially considering it is primarily a bar. Don't expect to be wowed, but the food is okay.   The drinks are crazy cheap, but that also attracts a certain cliental. The place kind of seems dirty by default.   In short, not a bad place for a drink and quick bite, but they need to work on their identity.",

First, she was very flighty and her attitude the whole night was as if she had somewhere better to be. Maybe she had an emergency, which management should have let her take off. She would ask us if we needed something and before we could answer she was rushing off. Then someone gave her a box a cigarette box while still on the floor. I don't know about you, but that's kinda gross. THEN the food comes out. Everyone's comes out, one by one, except mine. She comes around five minutes after the last person gets their food( none for me still) and asks how is everything. We notify her that I still don't have mine. Another 10 minutes go by and nothing. I see her zip out of the restaurant presumably to smoke the green box of cigarettes I saw earlier. Finally after 15 minutes I get my oysters, although without my fries(which are clearly indicated in the menu). Then after about 15 minutes she comes back in and finally gets to our table and I inform her I didn't get my fries. She said she would discount it. So we were ok with it. But then she grabbed some silverware(for her end of night duties) and sat in the booth next to us and kept staring at us so viciously in an attempt to have us leave(as if we were there for 4 hours, even though it has only been about an hour). Soon after that she went into the back and brought her phone out to the table and began texting, then looking back at us. She even called another waitress over and kept talking to her and looking at us, obviously talking about us. I finally couldn't take it any longer and to make my friend's birthday more bearable I tried to ease the night and we got our checks and left. It was just a night that was supposed to be a fun night that ended up being pooped on by the service. We still left get a decent tip (20% versus 30%) but discounted the fries value she had told us she would have($3 value).   Then I just called to ask for an email since there was no email on the website and Winter answers the phone and  \"Hellooooo?\" Not a friendly greeting. I ask if this is Hef's and she confirms it is. I ask for an email to complain and she says \"Hold on.\" Instead of putting me on mute, she laughs and makes fun of the fact that I want to make a complaint. Not a great image of the bar. I'm sure there is good business, but I will not recommend this place.",

    "text": "I am reviewing the Hef's on Sardis Rd!! OMG...after we had a terrible experience at Kristopher's bar & grill, our group decided to head over to Hef's! Can I say THANK YOU....THANK YOU....THANK YOU!!! Not only was Ryan (our waiter) the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBomb.com&s=716853a54974befb18bd2a2079d876386c9ebd876290947c699fc1e3eaccf129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bomb.com</a> but everything was amazing!  We arrived at Hef's because we had a unpleasant racial experience at Kristopher's bar & grill. When we got there, immediately Ryan (our waiter) began engaging with us. Friendly, smiles, open to answer food questions, etc. Out of 8 people only 1 of us had been there. Well I can say we have already made this restaurant our \"Go to\" for hanging out. The food was great, service was AMAZING and the music and atmosphere was perfect. Not only did Ryan remember the orders but he remembered small details of condiments for each of us. He even pulled out the chair for my female friend when she returned from washing her hands. Chivalry is not dead (smile).   If you want a great experience and awesome service, check out Hef's on Sardis Rd. and ask for Ryan!!",

    "text": "Ok, folks, here it is short and sweet.  With a name like Hef's ...you never know what to expect....or at least i didnt.     An old OCharleys converted into a stand alone \"sports bar\" with tons of TVs.  Hours: open until 2 AM...which means decent food (thats not fast food) LATE.  Bar is in an awkward spot...however, the bartender really knows how to mix a drink.  She nailed my friends obscure request.  The Menu:  not just your typical bar food...but they have that too.   My friend got a steak which was cooked perfectly.   I chose to eat off their Asian flare menu.  Mine was Chicken and veggies with a Thai Red Curry.....it was OK at best...but you cant expect Thai House food at a bar.  They also had other things like Burgers, Nachos, Chicken Strips, Pastas, onion rings, etc.    All food was served hot and cooked to order.  Waitress and hostess were both cute as a button and really friendly.  I hope this place makes it....because there is a very limited number of places to eat in CLT after 9 pm. Nothing ever seema to last long on Sardis Road North....but i hope they can pull through.",

They have great specials on beer and they have drink specials everyday.  For lunch I ordered the spring rolls to start and the crab cake sandwich (which is pretty big) to eat. Both were excellent! For some reason my food took forever to come out. I got my appetizer right before my meal.  I was with a party of about 7. The second time I came for dinner I was with 3 other people. It was a Saturday night and we got seated right away. I ordered a turkey club. I had the least complicated order and it was still last to come out. They brought my fries a few minutes after my sandwich, which was kind of annoying because I already had to wait. My food was really good and I left full. My friend ordered the spinach artichoke dip and it was huge and delicious! They do not short you on food and you get your money's worth! One of my new favorite spots.",

My drink never went empty which is a star deduct for me.  I wanted something different than my usual standard lunch fare so tried their Godfather sandwich which is roast beef, copocolla, lettuce, tomato with mayo and Italian dressing and it was really good.  Fries are breaded which I don't care for but that is subjective and they were cooked right, they also offer a side-salad or chips and salsa for a side so next time I will try one of those.  Sports bar type atmosphere and feel.  Overall a good lunch experience!",

    "text": "Ok, so I just left Hef's on 10+!!! After eating  and not tipping because receiving less than stellar service from my waiter Emilio. Let me start by saying I ALWAYS tip according to service. Therefore, I didnt leave Emilio because of his lack luster service.  He did the basic minimum of his job. He took my drink order then a few minutes later he came back and I  ordered my food. I ordered a side salad w/ my dinner  thinking it would come out before the dinner entree but it didnt . So, when he brought out the dinner and the salad at the same time I said I thought the salad would come 1st. He said you didnt tell me you wanted it 1st . I said  didnt know I had to tell you. Then, he goes on to say this is not 5 star restaurant this is a sports bar. I said it doesn't matter but whatever.  After that he nva came back to check on me ,refill my tea etc until it was time for the check. I asked for to go container for the  salad and someone else had to bring it along w/ the top for the dressing. At that point, I decided he did not deserve a tip. I paid for my check and I was leaving so I thought.... I hear someone say \"ma'am \" I look back it was Emilio.  He said I need you to come and clean off your table since you did not leave me a tip. Then he proceeds to walk up on me and tell how rude I was not for leaving him a tip and how everyone knows I have an attitude and if I didnt want to leave a tip I should've went through the drive thru and how the owner would agree w/ him. Then the  hostess chimed in stating, he was nice to me and he is one of the best waiters. How in the hell would she know if he was nice to me? Hell , I had to get her to bring the cover for the dressingThey both went on to tell me how much he gets paid and said tipping is required and Emilio stated it was a law. I was so discussed I had started cussing . I've never have been so humiliated ,embarrassed  that I had to make scene over my right not to tip for service.  After I stated I will be posting my experience the hostess(she didnt tell me she was hostess til after the fact of me stating I was going to post) then asked me did I want to speak to the owner.  I said hell no since you want to act like your are the representative for Hef's and Emilio. I did tell her  to shut the f up and stay in her lane. Btw , I have patronized this place at least 25-30  times  since I've moved to Charlotte and I never have had an issue until now and due to this issue I do think I will be returning.  I also , work for a company that frequently uses you for parties. I will be letting my company know how I was treated at this establishm",

Ok let me tell you I was initially impressed with the bloody Mary I ordered.. they had my favorite mix but they went far & above & added lots of extra goodies.. horseradish, worschishire sauce, lime,  celery ,olives etc. needless to say that was a damn good Bloody Mary. Ok now the food pretty good oysters but my favorite was actually the freshly cut veggies, wow what flavor & variety. Last but not least the phenomenal service we got! I mean I'm talking good stuff here.. Nancy was our waitress & was very professional. Well I'll definitely b back that's for sure. You had me at hello Such a great team here at Hefs Great job guys, keep it up.",

As soon as we walked in we were greeted and sat down in a comfortable spot. Our waiter whom we speculated is related to the owner was awesome, was patient, attentive and gave us superb service. Our party was a bit large and different people asked for extra this and that at various times which was a little annoying for me because I don't like bothering waiters excessively, but this young man was so quick and friendly as well as professional. Our food was super, tasty and hot! I was impressed by the large quantity in portions that were served; I had the blt with avocado and boy that was crispy and generous with plenty of bacon and avocado, not too much mayo and big chunk of a tomatoe, it was heaven. We also had the fried flounder at the table and I gave it a tiny bite which was so flavorful and had delicious breading. I will be trying that next time. Restaurant was clean and pleasant, it has the sports bar feel without the smell. Overall I was truly impressed with our server whom I believe did awesome for such a large picky party.",

The Garlic Romano was a close 2nd favorite, but it was a bit greasy, still smashed though. Lol.

Then after waiting 15-20 minutes when we were all done eating, had to flag someone down again to see why my friend's food never came back corrected. Not cool.  Very annoying.

It was around 9 when we arrived. We were seated by the hostess and our waiter was kind and tried his best to get drinks out to us in a timely manner. We order food, which consisted of about 50 wings, two orders of fries, and cheese bacon fries. The bacon fries come out really quick. No complaint about those. But we continue to wait and wait and wait for our wings. About 45 min later we get tired of waiting and start noticing people around us getting their food before us, even though we arrived first. Then we see the table behind us receiving complimentary fries for their wait. We start asking about the wings and the fries (which we wanted to come out first). We still hear nothing from the owner/manager or whatever he is.   Finally, I get up to pay for drinks so we can take our business elsewhere. The \"owner\" comes rushing out the back and is very hostile with my table. Right away he is blaming us, the waiter, the day, anything but himself and the kitchen. I ask what he can do for us and he yells \"50% off that's it\". He is making my table VERY angry with his hostile attitude so I step away from table to pay and leave. Once again he won't let me pay for drinks to leave. He is YELLING at our waiter and blaming him for our wings taking so long. Asking a THIRD time to pay he is still yelling in the kitchen. Left a 50% tip for our waiter for his excellent service and then we left.   I choose to call them back to let them know about our experience, hoping to get an apology for the service. I finally get the \"owner\", Danny, and he is angry and rude with me. He keeps interrupting me and cutting me off asking what I want him to do. I didn't want free food, I wanted a sincere APOLOGY for the way HE treated us. All I got out of him was excuses and blaming other people for his incompetence as a manager.   We will NEVER return to Hef's again. Not after the way Danny treated us and our friends (new customers) we brought in. Don't waste your time or money here. They are not loyal to their loyal customers.",

So he goes back in the kitchen and apparently asked the kitchen staff about my shrimp.  The owner comes back to my table...gets in my face and says the kitchen staff denied sending my food to me like that.   He argued with me & made me cry.  I begged him to leave my table.    He had the nerve to give us a bill.    I used to go here three times a week.    Beware!   Go elsewhere!",

My waiter (I won't name names) inattentive and when I asked for the check I wanted 15 minutes. Still no check. I finally tracked down another server and got the check. Never seeing my server again. Then with my bill which was $10.83, I gave a $2 tip. Making the total $12.83. The payment went through on my card as $17.83. They changed the tip amount!!! I am very upset over this and the fact that an employee would change the amount I tipped.",

The jerk chicken was sweet and spicy with a sweet Jamaican relish. The wrap it self was toasted and crispy, not like anything I've ever seen before. I definitely loved the flavors and will be coming back! Thank you for the great service and accommodating for a family with four young kids.",

Their Cajun pasta and Asian styled broccoli chicken/shrimp is delicious too. I come for the oysters too for their happy hour special. It doesn't taste the freshest but still worth the price. They have daily drink specials. If you like light beer, they have $1.50 Miller lights and 3.50 vodka drinks. All their beers are less than $5. The only reason I'd give this place 4 stars is because the service is slow but the staff is still very friendly. For the price, I don't think the food taste half bad in my opinion, which is why I gave it a solid 4 solids. Otherwise, it would've been 3 stars.",

Their menu offerings are reasonable, and provide for about what you would expect in the fast casual arena - sandwiches, salads and the like. Most of them are priced similarly as well.  The real issue that we have run into is that service is very spotty. While they are very friendly when they get to your table, getting them there is the real challenge. Even with a nearly empty restaurant it can be several minutes before being seated, and another ten minutes before someone takes your order, glasses can go empty for a while, and even if they do notice you are waiting on refills they seem to take their time getting back around. Ultimately it can be a frustrating experience.",

So we pick a booth, kid brings silverware and \"menus\". The menus were just some 90's dates inserts. Ok, so we look at the menu, and we sit for about 7-10 minutes. We sit some more, no one and I mean no one, but the bus boy who brought us the menus and the silverware came over. No server said sorry for the wait, I will be right with you, or anything.....so I said do you want to just leave? and so we left....no one said anything. No manager in sight....honestly the place lacks a sense of care and just appears to be a massive free-for-all.

Waited 3 min just for the hosted to come out of the back to sit us. Horrible horrible service. Never coming back. Also way too cold in here.",

I've made two special shopping trips down here, both heavily motivated by eating at this place while out.",

    "text": "My husband and I went on a Saturday night and LOVED it. I want to come back every week and rotate through the menu. We used to go to the old location and this new one has some old menu favorites and new options too. The nacho supreme app is outstanding and my husband raved about his shrimp wrap. They have great drink specials and a good looking happy hour menu. The food alone earns this place high ranks. My friend works close to there and has gone several times since it opened.   The atmosphere is comfortable. It's not too loud where you can't have a conversation and there's a huge projector TV and others all around the restaurant. I'll be watching football there next season.   The staff is friendly and the managers seem to have a good handle on service. The waitress seemed new, but then again the place had just opened a few days earlier. She still did a good job and was able to get my order customized too.   Overall, I highly recommend it and will be back often!",

Final showed up and asked us to wait a minute. went to the back to get a menu. He said something else, I could not hear him, very soft spoken, walked away, then came back. Another couple came in and the host sat them instead of us. We of course walked out, have never been treated so rudely in a restaurant. Will never return, first impressions last forever.",
