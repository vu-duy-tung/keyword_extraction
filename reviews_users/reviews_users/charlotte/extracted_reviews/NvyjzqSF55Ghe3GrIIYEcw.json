You are able to add extra topping to your pizza and it won't cost you anything.  Never had a bad experience with them even those sometimes they dont add enough toppings, but I let them know and they re-add some more.  Their chicken florentine pizza is my favorite.",

    "text": "My husband and I frequent Brixx at both the Foxcroft and  the Blakeney locations. We have always been satisfied with our visits. The food  has always been consistent and good.  This time, we have  decided to try the Dilworth location since we were in the area. I can't unfortunately say that the same experience applies for this location. The only item we both enjoyed, was the Arugula and pear salad. It was good and fresh . As far as the entrees, we ordered the wild mushroom pizza and the vegetable pizza. The arugula on the wild mushroom pizza was wilted and the vegetables on the other pizza didn't look fresh and were not very tasty.The pizza  crust was doughy in the middle. At this point, we would rather go back to the other two locations.",

    "text": "I called one night for a take-out order, and the person on the phone informed me that after 10, they have 2 for 1 pizzas. I paused for a moment, wondering if I heard correctly, then for some reason said \"No, thank you.\" I don't know why, either, I was confused! I have since filed it away in my brain, and have taken advantage of this many times.  The pizza is always good, cooked perfectly with fresh ingredients. My favorites are the Rustica or the Artichoke. I am also a fan of their sandwiches. Whenever I've gone in to get my pizza, it's always full of fellow pizza fans.  Look, some have said that it's not the best pizza, and maybe if you're expecting a typical American-style pizza you might find at Fuel or Hawthorne's, it's not as big or as greasy. But if you think of it more of a flatbread, or perhaps deliciousness in a box that they give you 2 of for no reason at all, it is perfect for me.  The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because of the teeny parking lot. It's not their fault, and I don't really know where they would expand, but it sure is awkward to get in and out, especially if it's full.",

    "text": "Where do you go when you have a couple people you're trying to feed with varying levels of adventure-seeking when it comes to food? Brixx Pizza. It offers thin crust pizzas from the ordinary (margherita) to the unusual (spicy shrimp) to rich pastas to sandwiches and wraps.  You can get the crusts in either regular or gluten free (meh) but they also offer a vegan cheese which is pretty darn good!  I always got the Brixx spinach salad with salmon as my go-to dish that didn't make me feel guilty like a pizza, but alas, the average quality of salmon I've had hasn't been great the last year or two (across locations) and they've overcooked it.  So now my favorite salad is the arugula pear with spiced pecans- YUM!  They offer a large beer menu and you can get an \"MBA\" - Master in Beer Appreciation which is like a passport of all the beers they offer.  The service tends to be generally attentive but not particularly happy- in sharp contrast to the staff of 10-15 years ago (I've been coming here a LONG time). The renovated restaurant is definitely more comfortable but I wouldn't say it's a place I would want to hang for a long time unless I'm outside.    Is it the best pizza in Charlotte? No. Is it a safe choice for just about anyone? Yes.",

The thin-crust, wood-fired pizza is good, but it's certainly not the best in Charlotte. (I'd say Wolfman is the best.) I like both the Margherita and Quattro Fromaggio pizzas.   I've generally had good service there, but the other day was an exception. The waiter forgot our drink orders and had to double check with us, never brought me water I asked for, then entered the wrong appetizer in the computer. When we got the wrong order, he and the other servers quickly got us the right one. Then the bill included both appetizers and we had to get that fixed. Still, he was apologetic and fixed the mistakes, so it didn't do much to tarnish my otherwise good opinion.",

Hubs and I frequent this Dilworth location for a quick tasty lunch on their pretty patio. I'm a fan of their Quattro Fromaggio as well as their Artichoke 'za. The 10\" \"personal\" pizza is plenty for me (for lunch) and I usually take home a few small slices. Granted, this is lunch.   The Quattro is super cheesy, as you expect, and the combination of cheese (mozzarella, parmesan, gouda and goat) are delicious topped with sun-dried tomatoes. The Artichoke 'za is a bit more healthy and one I normally choose - marinated artichokes, roasted red peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, basil pesto and mozzarella. Yum.   I wouldn't recommend getting wheat crust, as it was a little too dry and cardboard-y to me. The traditional is the way to go, my friends. Also, keep an eye out for restaurant coupons, etc. for Brixx. I've scored a few free appetizers and discounted entrees this way!",

    "text": "OK, so I tried this location after hating all the experiences I've had at the Blakeney location and it was better than a 1 star, but far from a 5 star.  They offer BOGO on apps and pizzas after 10, woo hoo! Thankfully they're open till 1am too, which is why we ended up there (Charlotte, you need more late night spots!). Tried the spinach and artichoke dip with pita wedges and it was awesome. Also ordered the brushetta and it was ok, but Mellow Mushroom's is much better.  For pizzas, we tried the mushroom and pear/gorgonzola/walnut. Both were lacking in any sort of taste. Sadly, I had to douse my pizza in balsalmic (I love it and it saves everything in my book), and while it was BOGO I regretted it.  Next time, I'll go back for the apps since I know the hummus is good, as is the spin/art dip but only because they're one of the only places open late.  PS: Why no Olde Mecklenburg on tap here? It's on at all the other locations...?",

I ordered the chicken florentine pizza and devoured the entire thing....so tasty!  The crust was thin and cripsy and the ingredients were fresh and plentiful.  The second time I went in the evening with friends and I tried their greek salad (yummy but a little heavy on the red peppers) and their americano pizza....DELICIOUS!  It's not my usual NYC-style pizza that I'm usually about, but I will be back.  You just can't beat a personal sized pizza.  :)",

Also the service is right quick, even when it's busy.  The pizza it's self is a nice thin crust. I have yet to have any of their pizza with a traditional sauce but their olive oil based sauce is decent, though i think it could use more garlic. The bruschetta is awesome though, and for my vegan friends, make sure to request it with pita chips.  The pizza are designed for one person to be able to eat. First time there for a light meal, I split a pizza with a friend and had to order more food. Note I'm not a massive eater either.  Good beer selection and drink specials. I would say they boast upwards of 20 different beer on their menu. Usually you can get a pretty good deal on them too.",

The ingredients were really fresh tasting and coupled with the slightly crisp crust... Pizza heaven. Fair warning though, I don't know if it is the norm here but the service we received was horrible. As in I had to walk over to my waitress to give her my check. As in I waited 10 minutes on a draft beer while she served others around us, who ordered after we did. At one point a she asked a different server to deliver the rest of our service while she went and sat down in a nearby corner. It was really embarrassing considering we were the only Hispanics in the place and seemed to be the only table she was having difficulty with. I'm not really sure what the issue was, but it was bad enough and embarrassing enough, I will not be returning. Good food cannot circumvent such hostile service. No thanks. I'll spend my money where they appreciate everyone's business.",

The building seems pretty old, which I think is why I don't feel like I'm eating chain here. The kitchen is pretty open here too, so you can see a lot of the pizza making & preparation. The seating area is not too large, but they do have a patio area that's ideal if the weather is nice. The lunch crowds are hectic here so make sure you get here early or late.  While I won't comment too much on the food considering it's a chain, the pizza is worth it. I love how they make their pizzas & they taste great without making you feel like you're eating junk. I absolutely hate the fast food pizza (Domino's, Pizza Hut, etc.), but this pizza is entirely different & much better. You will pay a good price for it, but it's worth it.

No matter the location I can always expect consistency.   Food:  I have so many favorites at Brixx it's always hard to choose what I want. If you've never tried the chicken pene pasta that is a MUST!  Make sure to ask them to add sun-dried tomatoes to the pasta, YUMMY!  Also, my favorite pizza would have to be the pear & gorgonzola: pear, caramelized onions and walnuts. It is a masterpiece for your mouth. Also the spinach and artichoke dip is wonderful! I always ask them to do half crostinis and half warm pita bread. It gives you some variety. The salads are also very fresh and tasty .  This location can be tricky during lunch and dinner time because there is limited parking in the Brixx lot and sometimes you have to park over in the shopping center next door and walk over. Like Nicole said in her review amazing patio area. Also, close enough to uptown off east blvd and scott that you won't have to worry that much about going past that hour lunch time.",

When I finally settled on the Rustica, which had prosciutto, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives and roasted garlic, I couldn't have been more pleased. The crust was crunchy but not dry and all the toppings were delicious. My dinner companion got the Chicken Florentine and he was also quite pleased. It is also of note that they have a respectable beer list, including one of my very favorites which is often hard to find on tap, Victory Hopdevil. Perhaps most importantly, when we asked for a box to take home our leftovers, the box was not made of styrofoam! No decomposing, food sticking, non-microwavable to go boxes at Brixx!

If you are feeling a late night bite though, they do have a 1/2 special for their appetizers and pizza I believe.   I've never had a bad experience here and I don't mind coming here at all. The pizzas are average and don't really blow me away in regards to quality and serving size. I'm the type of person that wouldn't mind paying a little more to get a lot more. An example would be their barbecue chicken pizza. It's a great little pizza, but lately their chicken and cheese have started to disappear and the price hasn't gone down with it. I could go to Mellow Mushroom and pay a buck more to get a better pie with better quality food and serving sizes.  The Brixx chain in Charlotte and Lake Norman is a great place for lunch. Just don't take somebody here on a dinner date unless you really want to go home alone.",

She doted on him and had great banter with us.  She was very sweet and attentive.  Our food came out quickly and our server kept our glasses full.  I got the prosciutto melon pizza which was fantastic and something I'll try to replicate at home.  My husband got the margherita pizza and we're looking forward to left overs and coming back for more.  We just moved from Philly and the pizza wasn't as great as home but comes close.  The crust was fantastic.",

    "text": "Came here for a quick lunch yesterday. Brixx is one of those places that I only go when someone else suggested it. Nothing against it, just kind of overpriced if I just want a slice of pizze (think Fuel). Decent lunch crowd. Getting in and out of their parking lot can be a test to patience. Luckily I wasn't driving. We got a booth immediately, which was surprising. We also were greeted very quickly. I ordered the roast chicken club (and I switched it to a baguette instead of focaccia) with a side of black bean salad. Lunch mate ordered the typical plain cheese pizza. My sandwich was $8.95... ok price I suppose. The chicken was very dry, and lacked flavor. Only redeeming quality was the garlic aioli sauce which looked and tasted alot like garlic butter... you won't hear me complain though. I lathered my sandwich all up with that stuff, and salt and pepper a little and created a better tasting sandwich. The baguette was excellent in itself. I don't know how much the pizza was, since it's a plain cheese. I took 2 bites, and I found it soggy at the bottom.  Lastly, our server likes to disappear. He did well with my hot water, but he never brought a refill for the coke until we were ready for the check.  And oh, I HATE that lousy to-go box, they should consider an alternative box choice. All in all, 2 stars due to lack of value, lack of food quality, and below average service.",

But they recently changed it to a tofu based cheese and now it's pretty nasty.  I wish they'd go back.  The first visit we ordered the hummus and pita appetizer (awesome!).  And a Brixx salad with chicken (awesome!) and a chicken club sandwich (also awesome!).  The sweet tea is very refreshing.  I had diet coke and the waitress never let me go without a free refill.  She was the bomb.  Highly recommended!    It's a local chain but it's not like it's Domino's, Little Caesar's or Pizza Hut.  They definitely try to be fresh and healthy but lately I feel they're losing ground on taste.",

When you think pimento cheese you think rich and filling, but this was nothing but. Others ordered the Bronx Bomber, which was good although I'm not a huge prosciutto fan. Another ordered the 4x4: 4 meats 4 cheeses: awesome. My wife got a salad. Boo! But it wasn't bad, it was something asian-themed or something. Decent, straight down the middle of the plate pizza.

    "text": "I love this Brixx! Although the food is no different from their other locations, this East Blvd spot is so much more cozy and inviting!  Patio seating is perfect on a warm night.  Extra patio kudos for the space being dog friendly!  And I've never had any problems with the service, ever.  The pizzas are slightly overpriced... but after 10pm pizzas and appetizers are BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE! (make sure you mention this to your server!) Brixx also has BOGO coupons everywhere! Citipass book, back of the Yellow Pages book, newpaper inserts, etc.  Menu is very vegetarian friendly! You can even get vegan cheese and whole wheat crust if you so desire. Both types of crusts are thin, wood-fired, and crispy; which makes them super light. Don't let the size of the pie fool you... if you're hungry, one person can take out an entire pizza! (or even if you're just in love with how perfect and delicious it is, in my case).  Appetizers: Spinach and Artichoke Dip is outta control good. It's even got a little zip to it. I substitute the crostinti for pita bread. The Bruschetta is good, although not my favorite in town. \"Wood Fired Pita Chips and Three Dips\" is really, really yummy. This is basically 3 different types of hummus (traditional, roasted red pepper, and black bean). Mmmm.  Salads: The first salad I tried here was the Brixx Salad, and it's so perfect I've never even bothered with anything else. Mixed greens, pistachios, goat cheese, croutons, balsamic vinegerette, and a hunk of house-mouse rosemary focaccia. Heads up, you can order a half-size for half-price!   Pizzas: The best part. I'd first like to mention that Brixx is so awesome that you can get these little pizzas half-and-half if you can't decide on what style you want, or want to split it with someone else.   My go-to is the Quattro Formaggio (mozzarella, parmesan, gouda and goat cheeses with sun-dried tomatoes) and then I add feta for good measure. Does that make it Cinco Formaggio?  Pear & Gorgonzola: !!!!! sliced pear, mozzarella, gorgonzola and caramelized onions topped with toasted walnuts!!!!!!  Greek: roma tomatoes, kalamata olives, red onions, and feta cheese topped with fresh basil and balsamic glaze drizzle.  Decent beer on tap selection here!   Open late (1am) when almost everything else in Charlotte is closed!",

I love the patio here--great for beers. Lots of people hang at the bar here, although you can definitely do better. The bar doesn't really offer much as far as I can tell: it's decent--a couple of tv's, some chairs.   Great beer selection, lots on draft, which is great. As for the food, it's just ok. If you're gonna get a pizza (and you should), try the Spicy Shrimp. I really like it. Someone in my group got a veggie and vegan pizza (vegan cheese etc), and it didn't seem all that appetizing. Another friend swears by the penne with vodka sauce; I tried it and it was decent. The salads are pretty good (and cheap) and the bread they're served with are really tasty.   Again, though, this place is packed, so some people LOVE it. It's fine, but it certainly didnt dazzle.",

We have had these on a few occasions and really enjoyed them (especially the I-77 IPA) but I think something was wrong with their tap as it tasted almost syrupy- very heavy and just overall not so good.   I had a side Caesar which was just ok. I prefer creamy dressing and this was the vinaigrette type  (my fault- I should have asked). The rosemary focaccia served on the side was incredible though.   I went with the quattro formaggio with mushrooms and prosciutto added. The flavor of the pizza was good - but 1/3 of the pizza was crust and I'm just not a crust gal. If I did this again I would almost certainly not add prosciutto as it was too salty (yes prosciutto is naturally - but it shouldn't have been quite this salty). My boyfriend made the comment that it tasted like country ham, I ended up taking off most of it. He went with the margherita pizza which he absolutely loves, but I thought it was a bit soggy.   While certainly my first choice for pizza, it wasn't awful and I would probably give them another shot possibly for lunch.",

But I stopped here for a late lunch this week and came out with a great impression.  First off, although the place is small, they make use of every inch of space.   There are booths around the perimeter and tables placed close in the center of the restaurant.  Outside is a covered patio which looks like the place to sit when the weather is warmer.  There's also a few seats at the bar and that's where I sat.  Behind the bar is about 12 beer taps, a full bar and wine bottles racked on the wall and below.  To the left of the bar starts the kitchen...a stove, and a salad, fresh prep area.    I ordered a chicken florentine wrap but what I actually got was a Chicken club.  No worries because that chicken sandwich was wonderful.  The foccoccia bread alone was fresh and flavorful that made me want more.    Service at a bar is usually spot and and that was the same here.  And contrary to sitting at the bar, all I ordered was an unsweet tea.  :)  As for the parking lot that someone else mentioned, yes it is small but there's overflow parking in the next lot with a stairs up to Brixx.",

I called ahead to check their practices and they use proper procedures to ensure nothing touches anything that has gluten.    I ordered the spinach salad which at first came with croutons (but no read, so they got that right).  The waiter immediately got me a new one when I noticed and alerted him.  The salad without croutons was good but way overdressed and only had one vegetable.  What is it with restaurants these days? Why do salads usually only have one green and vegetable?  I had the 4x4 gluten free pizza which was alright.  It comes on a separate aluminum pan which is nice but the crust is not that great.  It is not at all crisp and it is kind of squishy/foamy.  The toppings were good but when has four cheeses and meats ever not been good?  All I all it was a nice experience to sit outside with my dinner date and eat, but not the best food.",

For our order, we got pizzas (Bronx Bomber to share between my boyfriend & I) & 2 Cesar side salads.  I echo Shauna a little bit, as I was a bit disappointed. The dressing was almost nonexistent & there were mainly pieces of the spine in the salad (which I'm not a fan of).  Our pizza didn't hit the mark either. The oregano was on half of the pizza, instead of spread all over, the edges of the pizza were somewhat burnt, & it just didn't taste as good as the ones at 6th/7th Street. Our friends had a veggie pizza & the spinach artichoke dip & seemed pleased with their food.  Other notes: parking is EXTREMELY limited out front, so you may want to check in the shopping center behind the restaurant.  The restaurant itself - as for the outside - is clean, but you have to deal with a lot of birds flying into the patio area, as well as looking for food on the ground. Prices are reasonable.",

I personally did a pasta dish, angel hair with marinara and meatballs and melted Romano cheese, that was wonderful. The others in my group did various forms of pizza, the 4 x 4 seemed popular, and these looked fabulous also!!!",

I like the pizza with pear on it (trust me). The crust is thin- the way I personally prefer. The salads are fresh. The outdoor area in Dilworth is nice.  It is a bit overpriced though and I will never understand the undying love that the locals have for it (really- there is a huge fan club)",

This experience was completely different than my first. The staff was friendly and helpful and very attentive this visit. The pizzas my friend & her family ordered were well made and not over cooked as before. I ordered the Brixx salad with salmon and I will most definitely order it again! The salmon was perfectly cooked; well-seasoned with a great sear on it.   08/24/14 I'm sitting on the patio at Brixx again, having just enjoyed a back-to-school dinner. Today I had the spinach & artichoke dip and ordered a spicy blt pizza to go. The app was great, but it's also a hard one to mess up. I tried a piece of the pizza & it was delicious! The crust was cooked to perfection & the topping melded well together. The service has again been superb & I'm very happy to see that Brixx has stepped up. I'll definitely be back!",

The quattro formagio and the mushroom pizzas are both fine though a bit bland. I love that pizzas is fairly thin, but would prefer that is have a bit more flavor and less raw flour or cornmeal stuck to the crust.   The Brixx salad is a winner for lunch if you aren't in the mood for pizza. Also, pizza is BOGO after 10 during the week and 11 on weekends.  This Brixx is incredibly convenient for those of us living in Dilworth condos. For that reason alone, we are regulars.",

    "text": "My fiancee and I went there the other night and had a rather poor experience. We walk in and were seated by a young man. Roughly 10 minutes had gone by and we still hadn't even seen our server to give him our drink orders. Since we were on the patio, we thought maybe he didn't know we were there. When he finally does come, it's the same guy that sat us (so he obviously knew we were there). He's fairly quick with bringing out the water and pizzas we ordered, but then he disappeared again for about 15-20 minutes. We finally had to get one of the bussers to grab our server because we were done eating and wanted our check (we'd finished 10 minutes prior to asking for him). All in all, the food was good, but the service was awful.  EDIT: I have contacted Brixx, as requested, and they have not responded back. It's nice of them to \"make an effort\" to reach out, but doesn't help if they don't actually follow through.  EDIT 2: After my initial edit, the manager contacted me again and sent us some vouchers to give them another shot. We haven't gotten by there yet, but we may give them another shot to see if our experience was a fluke or not.",

Frozen pizza from the Food Lion taste way better!  So, far the best pizza i've had in Charlotte has been in NODA, Revolution!!!!",

I don't know what has changed but I told my wife ...\"next time I say let's go to Brixx, remind not to\".  Update:10/30/2013 The general manager contacted me about my review.  He wanted to make it up to us so he sent a Comp card.  So the wife and I went back.  We had bruschetta and pizza.  This trip was much better.  The food was delicious and the service was good.  I have to give Brixx management credit cause so often companies do nothing about complaints.  I am changing my rating to 4 from my previous 3.  Good job Brixx!",

    "text": "This was my first time eating at Brixx. Certain beers were offered at $3 (not sure if it was a happy hour things or it's a certain day of the week), but there were quite a few options available. I opted for the Laguitas IPA. If you're a fan of IPAs, this one is pretty good.   For a meal, I decided on the buffalo Chicken Pizza. It was fresh and delicious. The service was a little slow and parking is a bit limited, but there is parking in the adjacent shopping plaza. Overall, a good experience.",

    "text": "Man the people that give this place anything above a 2 star review haven't had good pizza apparently. We got the 4x4 and chicken florentine. Both super bland and dry. The 4x4 was \"supposed\" to be loaded with meat but the entire pizza had only a couple pieces of meat. More cheese than anything. The florentine had no flavor at all. The chicken was dry as can be. It was like chewing thru cardboard. This pizza is literally comparable to cicis buffet and to be honest for the money you're better off going to cicis. Not to mention our server came by once to take our order and then at the end to pick up the check. I had to get this other girl working to get us plates, straws and refills which were empty for several minutes which really sucked as I tried to swallow the extra dry and bland pizza down my throat. Save your money and go somewhere else. This place is horrible.",

So we were just sitting there. There was only one other table and a couple people at the bar so I don't know why it took so long. When she finally did bring menus and napkins she just placed them on the table not saying a single word and walked off. So we got up and left.  I am currently sitting in Harper's enjoying great food and impeccable service from all staff members. Never going back.",

I ordered the Caesar Salad, which was ok. The lettuce was ok, however a lot of wilted pieces, but the focaccia bread was fresh. As for the pizza, I chose the Roasted Chicken. It was hot & fresh, but was a little underdone, at least in the middle. I ended up cutting the middle out and enjoyed the good crust.",

The staff is always friendly and the atmosphere is laid back and casual. It can get a little loud, but this is to be expected. It's a pizza place, not fine dining.

They also have great drink specials throughout the week, including 1/2 price bottles of wine on Sunday. This spot also has ample parking, even though some of it is mixed in the front and in the back. Overall, not a bad thin-crust wood fired option in the area. I do wish their gluten free crust wasn't a $3 up charge though.",

Waited for about 2 mins to be greeted by a server who was not ours. He brought us menus and kids menus. Another 2 mins later we eventually got a server who didn't not introduce herself. Ok cool.. no biggie Currently being in the restaurant industry. I know the struggle of taking a table with kids. So I planned out all the right answers for our un named server. I wanted to make it as easy as possible.  We get our drink orders in. Cool..  5 mins pass  Drinks come and put our food order in.  Once food arrives via I'm assuming manager he asks if we would like any shredded parm. Waits 5secs and says no...? Ok.. walks off. While I was trying to get an answer for him.  We enjoyed our food.  Once I got my check I knew our servers name Molly.  Sweet girl. Seemed a bit overwhelmed. Her answers were short. Her face told me she had other things on  her mind.  Made a Togo order. Paid and we were on our way.  I say this in hopes of constructive criticism. We always can improve steps of service as well as pace of service. Team work makes the dream work!  Thanks guys.",

We arrived around 10:30p yesterday for some late dinner, I haven't been to Brixx before and I was interested in how good the pizzas were..so late night was the best time to try. There was also $1.95 domestic drafts which was also cool.   I was surprised to find a large, unique pizza items which was pretty nice. We ordered the Mexican pizza, the black been spread sounded good, and the Caribbean Jerk pizza. It took a while to come out, but it was worth it. They were both delicious. My favorite part: the veggies were so fresh and the chicken was tender. This is pretty hard to find when ordering from your large chains like Dominos or Pizza Hut. The pizzas were also really big too, it was about the size of a dinner plate, with the ample toppings..two and a half slices left me full. I love the cumin flavor that came out of the black bean spread on the Mexican pizza and the extremely fresh pineapple bits on the jerk pizza. There is also fresh sliced jalapenos on the Mexican pizza, with seeds, so if you don't like spicy you might want to order it without them. Over all, very unique and yummy!   Our bill for the 2 fresh, well portioned personal pizzas and a pint was $13. Totally worth it, we will definitely be back...with friends. Hit up late night happy hour when you have the time",

Got a friendly greeting as soon as we entered and were seated immediately; outside seating is serene, clean, and quiet. The food is delicious, nothing quite like it! The crust is thin and tasteful. Well priced (about $10 for a 10\" pizza). If you can, ask for Shay (not sure if I spelled it correctly or not) but she is seriously the best! Very nice and gives great service.",

Great service by Erick who was kind & always smiling. He checked in with us several times to make sure we were happy with our food. He was very busy tending several tables but his service was still very nice. We ordered the hummus trio (Vegan) & a veggie pizza with pineapple & vegan cheese (all vegan). It was delicious & came out very quickly. We ate & were out of there in less than 35 mins. The staff was all very friendly! Bathrooms were very clean & had a diaper changing area for babies in each of the two gender neutral bathrooms which is always a plus & I wish more places offered that. (Dads change diapers too!)",

This is the first sit down pizza restaurant I've been to so far. I visited on a weekday, early evening. The weather was still nice, so I sat on the patio.  My companion ordered the shrimp carbonara and I chose the 4x4 pizza. The service was attentive, great atmosphere with a large amount of customers. The pizza was thin, not too thin, but held up well with all the toppings. I couldn't get enough! I had a few bites of my friends pasta which was also delicious.  I was very pleased, and will definitely come back to enjoy the other pizza pies on their menu.",

    "text": "Erin K. mentions the crowds.  I have, on occasion, picked up carry out from this location during peak dining hours.  It was difficult just to get in the door, let alone to find a place where I could pull someone aside and get my food.  So I concur: don't go when it's crowded.  This is one of the reasons Brixx is great, in fact: you don't have to go when it's crowded, because they are open until some insane time like 1 AM.  Is that a big deal in and of itself?  For starters, in Charlotte the answer is \"pretty much.\"  So few restaurants here are open late.  But the real key is that they are both open late and serving quality food until late.  The centerpiece of their offerings is their pizza.  This should not surprise you if you've looked at the name of the restaurant.  In my book the pizza actually deserves three stars, not four; but I think that's mainly because I don't care for this style of pizza, with thin crust and sparse sauce.  The ingredients are high quality and there are plenty to choose from.  One of my favorite pizzas is the Rustica, with garlic cloves, Kalamata olives, and red onions.  They used to have a special on (I think) Wednesday nights that was also very good; I think it was either an olive oil or a pesto base with blackened chicken, basil, and red onions again.  (If you want something that's not on the menu, ask them to make; they've never hassled me about that.)  Their salads are good, and their spinach artichoke dip is really quite good.  Staff is always very friendly and reasonably prompt.  Prices are very reasonable.  Go off hours (I used to show up at midnight; at the time they closed at 2 AM) and you won't have a problem having a nice meal.  Did I mention I love that they're open late?  (Disclaimer: last I checked they close at 10 PM on Sundays.  Also, after 10 PM or so it's pizzas and appetizers only.)",

One question has bugged each time I have gone to any a Brixx location; how are they allowed to call themselves \"wood-fired\" when THERE IS NO WOOD in the place?? Even for the pizza waste land that is Charlotte, Brixx is disappointing.  The one saving grace may be the drink menu. There is a variety of beer and an om wine list. Specials are not great but prices on the list are reasonable.",

The Dilworth location is good....nice view, nice atmosphere and attentive service.  However, the the average 10\" pizza was around $9.  They specialize in thin crust pizzas.  Don't get me wrong, it was good.  But if you want a heartier pizza, try Fuel.   The beverage selection was limited and though this is a nice place for a lunch date, I wouldn't recommend it for a night out.  To its defense, they have salads that appear to be prepared individually rather than in bulk.  My friend had a huge bruschetta platter (though it was called an appetizer).  I would go back if invited by friends, but what's the point in going somewhere the specialty isn't so special?  Give me a nice medium-crust, no-frills pizza any day.   Hey, you wouldn't go to the Waffle House if you hated their waffles would you?",

Anise taste like licorice, if you don't know. It wasn't tasty at all and I lost my appetite.  Both times when they screwed up the orders they deducted the price of the pizzas, which I guess is okay but it doesn't make me want to come back there.   Who wants to have to order things twice?   It used to be a decent place, but Brixx must have gone through an ownership change recently.  This particular one was renovated in Winter 2011 and they added a lighted awning to the patio.  The menu has changed, as well.  The pizzas are very dry and apparently, the cooks don't know how to make these new ones because they keep screwing up the orders.  Also, it has a non-functional bike rack along Scott Ave. made of concrete.  There are better pizza places in Charlotte.",
