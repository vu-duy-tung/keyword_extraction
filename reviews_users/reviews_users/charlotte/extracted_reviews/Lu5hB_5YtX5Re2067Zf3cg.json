I had the Isola Verde pizza, with arugula, fresh mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, prosciutto and parmigiana. Delicious! We sat outside on their simple little patio with a glass of Chianti and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. I ordered the 11' for myself and had plenty leftover for a fantastic lunch the next day.",

These folks own a few restaurants around town (Coco Osteria, Luce Ristorante, and a few others) that have always served me well, so I was excited to check out MezzaNotte.   I agree with William S that some of the servers are a bit too eager...perhaps it's because the location is still new, so they don't have that mix of jaded expertise that is just right.   I was there on a Monday evening, and the wine was 1/2 off, which is GREAT. I had the gnocchi, which were awesome. I'll be back again.",

    "text": "MezzaNotte is in our 'hood, and we'd tried it twice and thought \"uh, nothing special.\" Last week we met some friends for dinner and had a bit of a better experience. Some tips:   1. No need to order an appetizer. They aren't great and the white bean dip with the bread that they put on all the tables is much better. Save some moola.  2. Go on a Wednesday and they have 1/2 off bottles of wine. Bonus!  3. The pizza is okay if you're into brick oven. The marguerita version has a ton of sauce and fresh mozzarella rounds. So if you're more into cheese then pizza sauce, not for you.  3. The salmon was very good, as was the steamed broccoli. The jasmine rice that came with the salmon not so much. Tasted like Uncle Ben's microwaveable bags.  4. The tiramisu was very good, and I don't even really care for tiramisu on the whole.  5. Our server was attentive without being overbearing. I think this was partly because the couple we went with are regulars (I honestly had a flash back to the show Cheers when they shouted \"Norm\" every time the guy walked into the bar). The other two times we went, not such great service.   Overall, we'll probably be back at some point since it's only about a mile and a half from our house, but MezzaNotte is not on our list of top restaurants in the area.",

    "text": "Stunningly bad experience, even by Charlotte standards.  The waiter was a very creepy fellow that turned out to be one of the owners (evidently, relative of the creepy owner/waiter at Toscana).  He hovered over the table when we sat down and just looked at us.  My Italian wife asked for some menu clarifications and requested some special preparations and the fellow smirked and was quite condesending and indifferent--we should have left then.  The food was worse than the creepy server.  The fried calamari was bland and the portion was almost big enough for a child.  The pizza crust was about average, but the pizza had cut up small chunks of ham that looked like it came from a bad salad bar.  Simply bad.  They did not even have real parmasian cheese to grate over the pizza, just the old crap in the shaker like 25 years ago.  My wife order the spinach ravioli with the sauce on the side.  The raviolis were obviously frozen, not fresh and were watery.  The sauce was mediocre.  The only good part of the experience was the 1/2 priced American beers on Friday.  Unless you like really poorly prepared food with a creepy service atmosphere, you will want to avoid this place as it will be joining the ranks of the closed, soon.",

But when we lifted the pieces up to eat them, they were all completely soggy on the bottom! What a waste of a wood-burning oven. Also, the olive tapenade on one pizza was so strong with anchovies as to be nearly inedible. Is it possible to get the pizzas to come out and not be so soggy?!",

    "text": "We made reservations to MezzaNotte on a friday night.  We showed up about 20 minutes early.  Upon arrival there was people in the front, and a young lady which looked like the host but did not greet us when we walked in the door.  She said \"Hi\" and walked away.  After about 15 minutes the Manager came over and looked up our reservation and informed us the table was being set.  We were then sat within a few minutes.  Not the best first impression but I give them the benefit of the doubt since it is friday night.  The service during the dining experience was good.  They kept drinks full and took orders promptly and clearly communicated any thing we would need to know.    Now to the food.  We ordered the fried calamari.  It came out and was very small for 10+ dollars.  It was also covered in fried zucchini which was very very salty.  The tomato sauce that came with the dish was bland and very watery.  Not the best sauce to serve with calamari.    For an entree I ordered just a Bolognese pasta.  This Pasta was not horrible but not a great meat sauce like I was expecting.  My wife ordered I think it was called the Rigatoni pasta with tomato cream sauce and peas.  It was a little bland but not bad.  Overall I do not think it was great and will not go out of my way to go back but may give them another try if I am in the area.",

    "text": "Perhaps I'll give MezzaNotte the benefit of the doubt because it was Restaurant Week... but if ever there was a time to woo customers and get them excited about coming back, RW is it, and I was left unimpressed by my experience.  Now, it wasn't bad in the slightest but definitely not a place I'm going to rush back to.  Food: Only okay, and some items were better than others.  The tomato soup was reminicent of Campbell's, although the added goat cheese provided a deeper flavor.  Panzanella is supposed to be a marinated bread salad, yet MezzaNotte's version is all tomato with a few croutons sprinkled on top as a last-minute afterthought.  The mussels & shrimp pasta was nothing to write home about, and the pesto gnocchi had a sour aftertaste; however, the waiter's recommendation of the veal was spot on and full of flavor.  Between the tiramisu and chocolate mousse torte, the tiramisu came out a clear winner (and this is spoken from the chocoholic).  Service: The service was pretty good throughout the evening, which I'm sure is no small task during Restaurant Week.  We were enthusiastically greeted when we entered and were brought complimentary glasses of champagne when seated.  Many tables around us were dining with children, and it never seemed overwhelming or out of control - either for them or for us.  Location: Located in the same shopping center as a Smoothie King, Chipotle, and Massage Envy (among other retail establishments), MezzaNote doesn't lack for parking, which is awesome.  Interior is nothing to write home about, but inoffensive too.",

We waited by the front door to be seated for a while that we thought maybe there is another entrance...nope just was setting the pace for the evening.  We were sat finally, and I like the menu because it has some of my old Favorites from Il Posto when they were opened. We started with the Caprese and it was delicious the Mozzarella was great! Now we finished with that and our server would just keep walking by and basically refused to take our dirty plates because he had better things to do like speak in Italian with the Manager which by watching them seemed as if they were fighting-VERY professional.....  For our Entrees we each had pasta dishes that were from Il Posto. My sister had the Rigatoni withe Peas in a Creamy Tomato Sauce with Sausage-She enjoyed it. I had the Pecorino E Gamberi-Penne with Shrimp and Zucchini in a white wine sauce Delicious and light!    Ok so now we have finished our Entree's and our server is once again going back and forth with the manager but this time the manager is now enjoying himself some  dinner and a beer at the bar-must be nice! Finally he comes over and asks us if we would like desert we got the Tres Leches-Not good very dry.   And Finally we are just sitting there waiting for our check to come and our server is too busy doing his sidework!!! So i finally asked the busgirl if she could grab it for us-this whole evening consisted of horrible service with the fact that he could care less about his job he obviously just goes to work to hang out and BS!! I will finish with that the food was great and I just hope that the next time if I decide to go back that he is not our server!!",

I've been to MezzaNotte a couple times and each time has been good but nothing spectacular. However, during my most recent visit I ordered the maccheroni alla norma - rigatoni pasta with sauteed eggplant and garlic in a tomato basil sauce tossed with fresh mozzarella. For $12.95, this steaming, baked plate of deliciousness filled me up and left me some to take home. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the flavors were bright and tasty. Delicioso.  Prices are fairly reasonable for upscale-ish Italian...plenty of pastas, pizzas, appetizers, entrees and a pretty solid wine list. Plus, those nice Italian boys always ensure that you're happy with your meal. Mangia, people!",

My daughter got the Mussels, they were very good, loads of garlic and cooked perfectly.

I had the Papperdelle with Tenderloin Pieces and Roasted Cherry tomatoes..Not special..tasted like Stouffers..My daughter had the Veal..it was okay...  just meh..nothing great and the rushing was obnoxious...We had ordered a bottle of wine..which was not done by the time the dinner was on the table..way too fast!!",

Just what we wanted, to be rushed through our Christmas Eve dinner.  As we looked over the menu the employee hovered over us waiting for us to order. There was almost an audible sigh when we order antipasto prior to our main course. If we paused for more than 10 seconds in between bites the bus boy was upon us trying to clear so they could bring out our main course.

I once yeld the opinion that you couldn't get good pizza in the US because of the lack of native born and enthusiastic Italians. MezzaNotte proves that wrong.  I can't speak for the non-pizza dishes, but I can say the pizza is good.   What I really like about this place is 2 things, the atmosphere, and the quality of the food.   The parking is pretty generous from many of the other places I've seen.   This place does not exist without a huge irony. Most of the staff that I saw when I went were Hispanic. Their working language was Spanish and their front of house language was English. This isn't a bad thing, its just rather amusing to see Hispanic workers doing as well as native-born Italians.   The best spot in this place: If they would move the dishes on the bar, is infront of the pizza oven. Its one of the primal urges that connects a person with food, and basic needs. Its a wood fired pit.   The bad: The place isn't a very large place, and I had to wait for 15 minutes just for a bar stool. I can't remove a star from this as that I got the impression that the front of house matradee keep very good tabs on who was still occupying a table, and who was leaving.",

The waiting area was uncomfortably small and filled with people.  It took 6 minutes just to check-in because the host was actually at the host stand for about 10 seconds every 3 or 4 minutes (and this continued the entire time we waited).  The rest of the time he was wandering the restaurant looking for tables.  Even though we had a reservation, the suspicion was we were just put in line with all of the others waiting--the majority of which were walk-ins.  In 20 minutes of waiting for our reserved table, we received no communication as to the problem or reason for the wait.  The host didn't seem to understand or acknowledge the service he was providing was poor.  So we left to eat at a great restaurant in the same complex.  If the service on the way in is this bad, I don't care how good the food is--the experience is already ruined.",

We decided to have a little dinner reception at the restaurant after our ceremony. It was a large party of 18 people. We had quite a bit of trouble getting a menu established with the managers. They don't seem to communicate very well and are largely unorganized. On The night of our reception most everything went alright, but we were disappointed that the managers didn't honor our menu requests. We paid a lot of money to have our families eat at the restaurant and while the main dishes were good, our agreed upon appetizers and desserts were not. We were highly disappointed and will probably be looking for a new neighborhood italian restaurant.",

As far as food was concerned, the bruschetta was topped with amazing balsamic vinegar and was reasonably priced. The mozzarella sticks, however, tasted store bought. The baked ziti was delicious and the bolognese sauce was very authentic. I was apprehensive at first sight of the baked gnocchi, but it turned out to be a terrific, flavorful meal. Dessert was by far the best dish; the tiramisu is easily the best in Charlotte.",

Food was fantastic and I grew up in an old school Italian family so I have high standards for Italian food, nobody beats Nonna's cooking but Mezzanote came close! I had veal osumbucco (I know I spelled that wrong) and my girlfriend had a shrimp scampi kinda dish. They both tasted great and presentation was very good too. Service was amazing, the waiter was very attentive but didn't stop by too much, recommended a few wines as well. They also brought us some canollis on the house since it was our anniversary dinner. Little things like that on top of great food, and great service wins repeat customers.",

After checking out the menu, I decided to go for their lunch special.  For $9.95, you have a choice of the soup of the day or one of the salads, a slice of pizza, a choice of pasta, and tea.  I chose the Margherita pizza and really enjoyed it. Definitely a True Italian style pizza - simple but quality ingredients - tomato sauce, fresh buffalo mozzarella and basil on a nice crispy crust.    For my pasta, I went with the baked eggplant penne pasta.  Really, the salad and pizza were enough for lunch, so I was able to take my pasta to go for another meal, which is a nice bonus!     I was pleased with both the food and the service on this visit.",

The host seemed lost and dazed, but this is really my only complaint. I had a Caesar salad to start and it was great. Perfectly dressed and a good portion. We shared a few pizzas, all of which were so good. My favorite was the pepperoni, it had a little spice to it and the sauce was amazing. We took home a piece of tiramisu, and It may be one of the best I've had. Very good, give it a try!",

Today driving aimlessly thinking where should I stop for lunch, decided to give it a whirl.  Sat at the bar, looked at the $8.95 express lunch  menu, get this. Choice of soup or two salads, slice of pepperoni or cheese pizza and then four or five main courses and TEA! nine bucks. Can I get a hell yeah?  Service was ok, my waiter, well, um, let's just say, \"he's just not that into me.\" It was pretty funny, he was pleasant enough, but very indifferent.  Which, hey, I don't care, as long as I have everything I need I'm fine.   I ordered the arugula salad, cheese pizza and chicken marsala. The salad and the cheese pizza were hitting the spot and I hadn't even had the chicken yet. The chicken marsala didn't have any mushrooms or a starch. It was chicken on a plate. It was good, not very marsalally, but good.  I enjoyed my lunch today and I thought it was a great value. One of the best  greetings is the olive oil white beans with crusty bread. That alone is worth the trip.  Can't wait to go back and see my BFF at the bar.",

It was one of their signature Pizzas (I never order this way - unless it is a signature Cheese Pizza).  This was a (I'll call it \"thin\" crust) Pizza with two types of cured Peppers, Salami, Sausage, fresh Basil leaves (whole leaves), Buffalo Mozzarella and a tasty Tomato Sauce!  While the flavor was very good the Pizza was Totally Beautiful as well! I'm picking on someone when I use the word \"Totally\" in case they ever read my reviews!  I would not chose this Pizza again, though if someone else chose it I would eat it again!  I prefer minimal toppings so It took a while to figure out why this Pizza was soggy in the middle (it was cooked perfectly) and the Sausage was the only ingredient I was not a fan of!  If this had been a sausage pizza it would have received half as many stars or less!  So far I have only been here twice, the food was very good both visits and I will return because if this multi-topping Pizza was this good I imagine a three topping (Basil, Cheese and Tomato Sauce - OK maybe that is considered ONE Topping) Pizza would suit me fine!",

When we told him we wanted wine, he told us that the wine was on the house tonight, since we did mention it was our first time going there.   The food was by far the best Italian food I have ever had without breaking the bank. All 4 of us kind of shared everything so we can rate everything and figure out what we thought was the best thing to order. Same with the the desserts, I have never had the best Tres Leche Cake in my life until that night.  Gianni knew what he was doing, from courtesy pours on our wine when a glass was getting low, he knew the menu very well, well he is the owner I would hope so. He knew what he was doing to make sure we would be happy walking out of that door.   I have been back to take my Mother and Grandmother for brunch and they loved it, considering they prefer to make their own food.",

It was much more crowded than we expected for a Tuesday, but it was nice to see that so many people were (a) trying it out for the first time or (b) enjoyed it so much that they're regulars.  We were seated right away, and everyone we came into contact with was very friendly.    The menu had Italian appetizers, sandwiches, pastas, and pizzas as options.  Although \"pizza\" is in their name, we weren't in the mood for pizza and opted for the calamari appetizer and pastas.  The calamari was average.  It was definitely fresh and of a good quality, but there were no spices or anything to boost its flavor.  Just a light breading and a side of marinara.  Good...but blah.    The pastas were good and you can get a small or large portion, depending on the size of your appetite.  My partner had the lasagna, which he loved.  It was very thick and meaty.  I had the farfalle with a cream sauce.  It was good, but again was missing some \"oomph.\"  Maybe it needs a bit of salty prosciutto like Macaroni Grill's farfalle al sugo bianco.  Or some Italian spices?    And I agree with William S's review where he said the atmosphere and decor was blah.  Their only wall hangings are vintage Italian ads which you can find in any World Market or Michaels store.    Overall, it was good, and we'd probably come back to try their pizzas the next time, but it's not someplace we'd make a regular habit.",

Yes, the prices are more expensive than the average casual Italian experience, but the food and service make it worth it. Try the entree dishes or authentic pastas. At the end of the day, the 3.5 star rating just means I've got this gem more to myself, but to be fair the food and service quality here exceeds other options on a consistent basis.",

As a person with a gluten allergy it is refreshing to go to a restaurant that traditionally serves a lot of gluten and have a delicious meal.  I love their chicken piccata that they make gluten free.  The service is always outstanding.   If you like Italian you can't go wrong with this or any of the Conte group restaurants.",

Even though our server seemed to have 6+ tables, he was prompt, friendly, and extremely attentive. After telling him what kind of wine I like, he made a wonderful suggestion that paired well with the meal. We started with the calamari and antipasto, both of which were excellent. The antipasto was one of the best plates I've had in the Charlotte area. The Rigatoni Buttera was AWESOME. For dessert, we tried the limoncello cake and torta di cioccolato--both were also to die for. The torta di cioccolato definitely satisfied my chocolate craving! Overall, excellent service and excellent food. Perfect for a date night.",

    "text": "As a huge fan of pizza in general, I have wanted to check out MezzaNotte for their brick oven pizza for a while and was excited when a friend suggested we meet for dinner this past week.  After arriving first I was seated in a booth by the door so my friend found me easily one he arrived.  After looking over the menu we decided to try the Calamari and Pepperoni Pizza, since the table next to us had one and it looked good. The calamari was very small and nothing special.  It definitely isn't something I would order again and hate that the marinara was cold, need a warm dipping sauce. As for the pizza I wasn't that impressed. The crust was good, but the cheese didn't taste that great and wasn't melted properly so there were chunks in areas that were very heavy and the pepperoni wasn't special, could have been a pre-brought brand.  Just a thought. As for the service, the wait staff were great filling up water promptly, but we only saw our waiter when he took our order and dropped the check off.  I wanted a second glass of wine, but after realizing my waiter was only focused on talking with the hostess the whole time I put my glass on the end of the table to get his attention.  Definitely wish he would have checked on us after taking our order.  Overall, it was okay.  If I am in the area I would be interested in checking out some of the Italian entrees, but not sure I would go back for their pizza.",

He got half way through taking our drink order and left before he got through everyone.  He came back 10 min later and took our order.  Then we waited over an hour for our entree.  No one came and explained to us why it was taking  so long or gave any estimate on when we'd get our food.  There was a nice girl who filled  our drinks.   Someone from the kitchen brought us our entrees which were overall tasty and hot.  No complaints on the food.  We asked the nice drink girl if we could get some Parmesan and she happily helped us out.  We can't comment on the dessert as after 2 hours we were ready to hit the road.  Maybe we will try the takeout next time and avoid dealing with the waiters.",

Our neighbor owns MezzaNotte and we learned he's from Italy, and figured it was worth a shot. We were more than thrilled! The food at MezzaNotte is incredible; the pasta is delicious, and pizza is authentic Italian. I tried my husband and father's dishes as well, and everything was superb. We are thrilled to find something authentic in Charlotte, and plan to try the remaining restaurants in the Conte Restaurant Group. If you are Italian, or just love real Italian cuisine, this is certainly the place for you!! Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu! Absolutely delicious",

We started off with two orders of the burrata which was good but the 3 triangles of bread were burnt and tasted smoked. I ordered the eggplant parmesan which was an extremely small piece for $17. The eggplant is notated as \"Napolitan style\" which I thought was not breaded and fried however this is indeed fried and breaded eggplant. Other people in my party ordered a margarita pizza, spaghetti and meatballs and shrimp scampi. All said food was tasty but it was a shame as the service sucked and it was pricey. Sever didn't seem interested until the check arrived and he was rushed to close them out. Come to find out he was heading home and wanted to leave for the evening. It's a shame the service was so bad as we probably won't come back. There are other Italian restaurants that are equally as good with staff that appreciates the business.",

We arrived on time for our reservation at 5:30 and were seated promptly as the place was about 25% full, on a Friday night.  Our salads arrived quickly and were good.  Then it went downhill quickly, or should I say like a slow motion train wreck.  We waited, and waited, 6:50 still no dinner, waiter said 5-10 more minutes.  When it finally did arrive, my friend asked to speak with the manager.  My friend advised him that the time frame to get dinner to the table was not acceptable.  The manager started waving the meal ticket, raising his voice in the middle of the restaurant and just wanted to argue.  This was so embarrassing for our group.  While the manager was ranting about how long it takes to cook food, the servers actually dropped \"to \"go boxes\" on the table.   I have never seen so unprofessional actions by someone in the restaurant business.  The food was below average, even for a strip mall restaurant.  They could really learn a lot about service and real Italian food from Momma Ricotta's restaurant.  We will never return to this restaurant.",

    "text": "If I could rate MezzaNote just on the service, I'd give them a 4.  But when you go out to a restaurant you go there to eat and expect the food to be decent.  Unfortunately, my experience with the food here was about a 1.  I ordered the Chicken Farfalle which is Bowtie noodles with spinach, roasted red pepper, in an asagio cream sauce with a sliced chicken breast on top.  Sounds appetizing.  I ordered this because I used to order something similar at a chain Italian restaurant and I enjoyed it.  But this dish is severely flawed here at MezzaNote.  The main issue is there is no flavor.  You'd expect some sort of spices and herbs like garlic, oregano, or even basil but there was nothing but this heavy cream sauce that looked more like something southerners put on a biscuit in the morning than something you'd find in an Italian dish.  The sauce was cheesy, that;'s about it.  Also the pasta wasn't cooked long enough and the chicken wasn't cooked evenly.  One half was perfect but the other half was overcooked and rubbery.  Honestly, I've had better Italian food at Olive Garden and OG is the last place I would go for Italian food....well maybe until now.     Another person at my table had the pepperoni pizza which looked appetizing but I can't say this was all that great either.  The flavor was decent but I like my pizza dough to be crispy and this was very mushy.    The strong point here is that the service was great.  But it's not enough for me to want to give them a decent rating or enough to want to return.",

I could have eaten just the beans. They offer a 3 course lunch special but we chose from the regular menu. I had the Vegetariana pizza. I don't normally do dairy but since my Neice wanted pasta I figured one time wouldn't kill me. They do not have other cheese options. They do have options for vegetarians. They also offer gluten free and whole wheat pasta. The pizza was filled with wonderful veggies. My mom has the eggplant Parmesan with lentil soup and my Neice had the Farfalle con Pollo. They do offer calamari but you have to ask for it. It wasn't on the lunch menu. We all loved our meals as well as the service. It is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful artwork on the walls.

The light fixtures and pictures are dynamite, as is the open oven area.   We were seated and a server came immediately to our table. Drinks came rapidly and we were soon ordering our lunch.  I did notice that lunch prices were a bit higher than most lunch spots. I ordered the chicken and shrimp kabob that was served on romaine with some tomatoes and other salad ingredients.  It was very tasty, however the portion was a tiny bit underwhelming, especially for the prices of over $15.  Before the meal came, they brought some square bread thingies and a bowl of white beans for spreading.  That was simply delicious.  I also loved that ice tea refills were being poured constantly; I didn't have to request even one.   All in all, it was a fantastic experience.  The are hitting on all cylinders in this restaurant.  Oh, I heard the pizza is particularly good, so if you are a pizza fan, this may be a place to try. It's easy to find on the corner of Providence and Sharon Amity.   Two thumbs up!",

He stood talking to the hostess while we waited to take our order, ask for Boxes and the check. The entrees were VERY pricey considering you don't get any salad/ soup to start and they were not good - the ravioli wasn't any better than the kind you buy in a store and I only got 8 for 20$.  Lastly there was an incredibly awful, Smell in the whole Restaurant",

    "text": "Great Neighborhood Italian  One of my favorite times of the year, Restaurant week.  My wife was in Pittsburgh and returning two days ago and her flight did not get in to 6:40 pm at Charlotte Douglas Airport.  Checked was available among restaurants that I wanted to try that I could make get them by an 8:00pm Reservation that was at the same time casual enough to serve someone in travel clothes and MezzaNotte jumped out. This one has been on my list for a couple of years now and for some reason or another, just never made it there.  Pulled into the Cell Phone Lot at 6:40 and my wife called at 7:00pm saying she was at baggage claim and would have her luggage shortly and would meet me outside. Left the lot and navigate the traffic at arriving till I saw her and we loaded the car and left.  Traffic was relatively light for Charlotte and we made it to MezzaNotte with 25 minutes to spare.  Parked the Car and walked in and explained to the owner that we had reservations for  8:00pm but could we go ahead and check in. With a smile, he said or course and escorted us to a nice table overlooking Providence Rd on one side and a rather attractive bar on the other.  The owner also introduced us to our server who proved to be excellent although English was not his primary language but he persevered and dinner came out perfect. The owner came by our table additional times during dinner and this hands on engagement was a sign of restaurant well run  We started with our beverage orders which for me was iced tea and for my wife, a Black Russian.   Restaurant Week features a Pre Fixe menu with three courses.  For our first course or appetizer course, my wife ordered Melenzane which is Eggplant stuffed with Caciotta and Mortadella e Parmesan.  My wife indicated it had a long time since she had had Eggplant and this presentation was excellent.  As for myself, I had the Salmon Carpaccio which was fresh smoked Salmon with fresh dill garnished with arugula.  Excellent presentation and one of the best Carpaccio's I've had in a long time. Great flavor, texture and visually appealing.  For the main course, we both chose the Veal Saltibocca alla Romana which was Roman Style Veal with prosciutto and sage over roasted potatoes.  Great taste and presentation was excellent and portion size was huge.making it one of the best values I've found during Restaurant Week.Portion size was such that we both took some home and guess what we had for dinner last night.  After all of this, came deserts.  My wife ordered her favorite Tiramisu, a Italian favorite which I went with the Profiteroles which is Cream Puffs filled with Vanilla Cream and topped with Chocolate.    Both offerings were excellent  Granted that Restaurant Week is just a snap shot of what a restaurant offers but this experience was enough to make both of us to want to go back.  Great service and food, good presentation, nice atmosphere and an accommodating management make this a great place for dining and I would recommend to anyone.",

We then watched 3 different groups walk in after us and get seated.  After 20 minutes there were no apologies and even after I told them to strike us off the list, just a blank face in return.  As someone who lives in the neighborhood, this was pretty disappointing.  Restaurant week is for showing off your service as much as your food, and they failed in that respect.  Hope they improve things.",

I was asked what I would like, I told the server soup and salad. So I sat and waited.  My food was now ready and i was handed the bill. I calmly said Jose always charges me $8.77 or so. The server said ok can you please wait I said sure.  Comes over to me is a short caucasion man who took my order, this is what he says to me in the most condescending, nasty attitude.  Ma'am this is what we charge, this is what my boss told me to charge I can't help you take it or leave it!!  I asked if a manager was there he says I'm the only one and I'm not the boss I just do what they tell me so you can take it or leave it I can't help you I have other people to take care of.!!!   Excuse me!!!!  I have never had this type of rude nasty service ever in here.  I told him how nasty he was and his attitude was horrible to me for no reason. Im at a loss for words. This was handled poorly!!!!   I will be contacting the Owner Gustavo and the manager.  This really almost ruined my day. I work in customer relations as a therapist and this IS NOT HOW YOU TREAT CLIENTS OR CUSTOMERS!!   I will be returning this evening to speak with a manager.",

The Italian bread seemed like it was cooked twice. Not a fan. I asked for real butter, which was much better!  My pasta dish, the Butera had great flavor, but too much sauce. There was so much I was having to tap it on the side of the dish to try to release it from the inside if the rigatoni.   If I had to compare it to Toscana - Toscana has better food, but worse service compared to here!  My friend ordered the Salmon and loved it. It was also swimming in sauce. She said the sauce was excellent, but became a little much especially when it was creeping towards her sides & soaking into them.",
