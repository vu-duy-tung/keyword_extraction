    "text": "Alright, today I decided I am never going back to Flying Biscuit again. I have been a super duper avid fan for the last 5+ years, going regularly, weekly. Even after the horrible incident with the murdered pregnant waitress whose body they dumped at the neighboring Chik-Fil-A-- and suddenly a huge drop in business-- I still made sure they knew I was a loyal customer.  I could write pages about this place. When they hit it, they hit it. Great breakfasts, and sumptuous Southern good, fantastic veg alternatives. Great menu. I wished on a number of occasions in various countries that there existed a Flying Biscuit in everyone of those towns.  Which leads me to present day. Today, I felt a wrench in my gut immediately after eating my burger. But that isn't even the main reason I'm never going back.  There is one waitress there that over the years, I absolutely hate. Hate, hate, hate. Her brain cell count is incredibly low though, it's hard to get mad.  BUT FUCKING TIME SHE MESSES UP OUR ORDER. I think it's like Number Sixth CONSECUTIVE TIME IN A ROW! I think she knows it too, because she always resorts to giving us coffee for free. We started think: is she racist? why does she hate us? we always tip well, but she forces us to want to stiff her. Seriously.  She's not explicitly rude, in fact the opposite, overly fakey southern honey and darling, but with an awkward smidge of forced politeness. And she is incredibly slow. And incredibly terrible as a waitress-- ie. i know she hates her job.  But don't make it my problem every single time I eat there.  Orders always get messed up, or the wrong thing. For example, today. I ordered a burger with a side of green beans. She came back with the burger and a pile of green beans. The burger didn't seem thoroughly cooked, there no jalapeno sauce like on the menu, the green beans were the GODDMAN WORST IVE EVER HAD, so FRICKIN OVERSALTED I HAD TO DRINK 2L of WATER-- and where were my bloody potatoes? Everyone knows potatoes go with a burger.  She ASSUMED I wanted beans instead of potatoes.  SO. I had to wait like 10 mins to get her attention, while my food got cold to tell her.  THEN. She gives me a rude quip, and this \"look\".  THEN. She comes back suspiciously too fast with these potatoes. They were practically cold, like they'd been sitting there for ages.  It annoys the hell outta me because the potatoes too, were a portion enough to feed an entire African country. I am not going to just EAT a mountain of cold potatoes.  My stomach is gurgling now. I hate Charlotte food. Charlotte food sucks.",

Two eggs, chicken sausage, potatoes and biscuit $7.99. Chicken sausage was hard, dry, and maybe made the day before?. Terrible!  The potatoes also could not have beent fresh, reheated, and tasteless. I'm not sure what the moon dust was they advertised, as they were plain. The signature biscuit was large and hard, cold and dusted with sugar. Poor value and bad food, not a good mix, sorry but I'm being honest.  p.s. I originally wrote this after our visit on 9/19/12, but not sure why it was sitting waiting to post. So here it is, hopefully, gotten better.",

Coffee was ok, but then again I'm so picky about coffee, but dont go by me. I had the Southern Benedict and it was Incredible. Open faced homemade biscuit topped with pimiento cheese, poached egg, choice of turkey or pork bacon. My fat ass chose pork and it was topped with two perfectly poached egg and just enough hollandaise sauce. My grits didn't need any butter or salt. Perfection. My boyfriend has chicken biscuits and gravy. I was skeptical about the chicken part, but it was delicious. Definitely didn't miss the pork and serving was huge!! I'm goin back soon!!! On a side note; The owner or manager came over to our table because we were looking for suggestions on where to go for fried chicken, told us to go to Price Chicken Coop. I'm loving this place!!! Yeah baby!",

They make their own chicken sausage. I was a little skeptical, but it was excellent. And the biscuits...while they weren't flying, they were huge and flavorful. Try adding their homemade apple butter on the biscuit and you will not be disappointed.",

For the dinner visit we actually had breakfast items; all were good and equal to average diner foods.  Our lunch last Saturday was just OK. The Fried Green Tomatoes had no seasoning to the crust and the goat cheese overpowered the slight sourness of the tomato.  My salad had old black greens mixed into the mix and the chicken was the cheap chopped and formed variety and not fresh.  And our waiter seemed to disappear towards the end making us have to ask for him and get our check. And the biscuits are bland and dry. Guess we won't head back.",

    "text": "Flying Biscuit is the place that introduced me to grits so I am eternally thankful for that. Their grits are so amazingly yummy that I don't want to go anywhere else for grits because it could come with disappointment. But then again, I'm not from the South so I'm not sure if  thats how all grits are or even if all grits are created equally? Anyways, enough of my thoughts about grits. They have chicken sausage, egg whites,turkey bacon which is a nice alternative to the regular stuff and serve breakfast all day. I've had both breakfast and lunch and found their lunch to be quite mundane so if you go, stick with breakfast, I love all the funky colors they have incorporated into the decor and their apple butter is tasty. If you go, be prepared to wait since there is usually a wait to get a table unless you want to sit at the counter.",

My food was done super quick! It was maybe a five minute wait! I ordered the Piedmont Omelet with Egg Whites, & Add Spinach, and Pancakes. The grits were the best i've ever had at a restaurant. Sooooo creamy!! If you like thicker grits, you may not like these though. You can tell they put sour cream in them. I can taste it. But I loved them! The biscuit was really hard. I just trashed it. They gave me what tasted like Apples, I thought it was Jelly. But after reading reviews I think it was supposed to be a butter. They also didn't include any butter for my pancake. I would have liked a little more egg and less meat in my omelet. I like egg in my omelet. Was too much meat in my opinion. Plus the place is kind of expensive for breakfast if you ask me. $18 total for my meal. It was still pretty good though.  Will be returning. It was at least better than ihop.",

These things are the size of your fist and can easily fill you up.   The apple butter. Oooooh, the apple butter. I asked the waiter to put a little extra in my to-go baggie b/c I wanted to do kinky things with it. Yeah, I said it. He cracked up then gave me an actual soup container FULL of this sweet heaven. Bless you, Juan, bless you.   Juan was an awesome waiter. Attentive, funny, on the spot, obliging and did not rush us even though the place was slammed.  I really liked my light and flavorful chicken wrap and my husband really appreciated the size & quality of his pasta/eggs/veggie combo.  I'd say this place earned a solid 3.75 STARS and here's why: a) it takes A LOT to get five stars from me b) we were quoted a 15-20 minute wait. We froze our tooties off in the wind and drizzle for damn near one hour. I've been a hostess. I've been a server. There are ways to correctly estimate wait times. This was so not cool. c) the tables are tooooo close.  Overall though, we were quite pleased and, luckily, we don't live closer - otherwise we'd be here more often and I'd be in a diabetic coma from that apple butter.",

    "text": "So I love anywhere you can order breakfast outside of morning hours. And any place that gets creative with their breakfast options gets high marks in my book.   I respect that they try to keep it fresh and on the healthy-side. You'll find organic options and turkey instead of pork.  Some of my favorites are the Turkey Hash (which comes topped with fried eggs) and the Southern Style Biscuit Benedict.    I'm also a fan of the Fried Egg Sandwich.    My only complaint, is that for restaurant with Biscuit in the name..the biscuits aren't really that good. They are dense and dry...but the Flying Biscuit makes up for that by serving you home-made apple butter that is out of this world.  Really, I could drink the stuff.  The apple butter goes GREAT on pancakes.",

The egg-ceptional eggs are, well, exceptional. Their biscuits are awesome and the serving size is perfect for Sunday brunch. Most important they have mimosas, a great way to start your day. I wasn't a fan of their sausage which knocks a star off. Kinda harsh yes but I'm super picky about sausage and ever in search of the best breakfast sides. Plus, yelp won't let you rate places half a star (can we review yelp?). Anyway, I'll order bacon for sure next time but everything else was great.",

We are new to Charlotte, NC (been here since Nov.2012) and frequent Blakney shops, Stonecrest and Ballantyne shops as we were in corporate housing in Ballantyne until recently when our home was finished. We drove past and saw this place on many occassions and never thought to go in and have breakfast.   After a great couples massage, the hubby and I were hungry and were driving and we thought maybe we should check out the menu at that Flying Biscuit place it does have buscuit in it's name so breakfast should be on the menu.  We arrived and were immediately seated in the country looking, quaint restaurant. I immediately noticed the decor which was fun and attention grasping which is great for conversation and great to keep children interested which I noticed was going on a couple of tables over from us.   My husband ordered the Chicken Sausage & Turkey Bacon Egg white omlette with a homemade biscuit & grits and I ordered the infamous Shrimp & Grits. Now I'm from Chicago and Wishbone in Chicago HANDS DOWN has the BEST Shrimp and Grits so I was very skeptical.  My husband ENJOYED his meal and is sooo excited about going back. ME on the other hand had HIGHER expectations for the Shrimp Grits from the reviews. They don't have ANYTHING on the Shrimp grits in Chicago at Wishbone. However the day after when I heated up my left overs the flavors had time to mix and mingle and it tasted much better (still not Wishbone in Chicago or 131 Main in Blakney).  I will be back to try something else as my husband is definitely impressed with the food for the price ;-)",

When we walked in, the place was packed.  We were the last table to be seated without having to wait (this was at 11:45 a.m. on a Wednesday).  The menu was very diverse - a ton of vegetarian options, but of course I went the carnivorous route!  I had their oven fried chicken.  It came with GRILLED MACARONI!!!  I had never had grilled macaroni and fell in love as soon as I tasted it - it is like your grandmother's macaroni recipe she served you on special occasions like Thanksgiving!  Instead of collard greens, I substituted with grits.  These are the creamiest, silkiest grits I have ever had!  I LOVE apple butter, but The Flying Biscuit kicks it up a notch by adding cranberries.

I'm not big on super sweet stuff at breakfast and these were perfect....just sweet enough, but not so sugary that you can't make it through the whole plate.  My bf and I also shared an order of the fried green tomatoes for a starter.  They are topped with cashew-jalepeno relish that is the ideal combination of subtle spice and rich, creamy nutiness.  Lightly fried and not heavy or greasy at all.  The biscuits....honestly, I have had better.  But, the apple butter that goes on them is awesome!  Slightly tart but still sweet and yummy yummy.  I topped all of that off with a gigantic chai latte that you can get either hot or iced....I opted for hot and it was delicious.  I had already ordered it before I realized there is also booze on the menu.....bloody marys and mimosas for those who want their afternoon brunch with a little kick.  All in all, superb food that came out super fast with slightly slow service due to the amount of business.  I can't wait to go back and try out some other menu items!  Oh and one more note, if you don't like rosemary, don't get the potatoes.  My bf hates it but ordered them without knowing and the herb was too potent for him to even make it through more than one bite.",

Up until recently the service was really good as well, but my last two visits have found me with surly, unattentive servers which certainly dampens my desire to return even though the food is unique and flavorful. Hopefully, they can get things sorted out.",

With a good meal in my belly, I was ready to take on the world! Or at least, I was ready to show my daughter how to take on some paper targets at the range in Matthews.  I've never seen any of their biscuits actually \"fly\", but they are excellent. Light and fluffy, I don't know why anyone would swap out toast instead. Mmm... big squeezy bottle of apple butter to top it with. Fab.  Other than the biscuits, I had two poached eggs (cooked perfectly) and two chicken sausages that were spicy and delicious. The small bowl of grits were nice and firm but not crunchy. Delish!  Service was pretty decent and the place was very crowded on a Saturday morning. It was raining, so we weren't able to sit outside.  Okay, world. Let's go!",

    "text": "My coworker and I had no clue what we wanted for lunch so we stumbled into The Flying Biscuit and were pleasantly surprised and very pleased with our visit!   We were greeted immediately and were told to chose our own seating, we picked a table in the back by the window. I totally fell in love with the quaint surrounding, they had country table linens,bright colored walls and a beautifully painted ceiling with pictures and quotes...make sure when you visit to look up! It was a very nice touch!   Once seated we reviewed the menu and they have a really nice selection no matter what you have a taste for! They serve breakfast all day which includes everything from omelets to breakfast sandwiches...and of course biscuits! For lunch and dinner you also have a great selection of salads, sandwiches and other home cooked meals like shrimp and grits and turkey pot roast.  I decided to try the 3B Chicken sandwich. It had blue cheese, turkey bacon, basil and tamari aioli on a grilled chicken breast. As a side I chose the oven roasted \"moon dusted\" rosemary potatoes.   The wait for our food was quick...we were one if only four tables in the whole place. And our waitress was a real sweetheart, glasses alway full and she was very attentive!   When the food arrived, it looked delicious! Huge portions, which is always a win in my book! And everything tasted great! I loved the combination of the aioli and blue cheese with the crisp turkey bacon! The chicken was very well seasoned and tender. The rosemary potatoes were very good...not overwhelming with flavor but a very nice addition to the meal!   The best part was that everything came out HOT! And I love that they give you so many alternatives here like turkey bacon, veggie patties and tofu.   Overall, great experience, service and food! Definitely will be back! Hopefully, next time to try their breakfast and one of those famous biscuits!",

Egg tortilla was fine but how do you screw that up? I did taste the biscuit and it is good but it's a bisquit.  So what? Oh and they serve that delicious diner royal cup coffee. Yuck. $20 and there is nothing about that meal that I would come back for. Honestly people you can do better than that at home.  The only reason I came in this morning is because there was a water main break and I'm without water.  If I'm going to go out for breakfast it must be something a step up from what I would do myself and that would be Another Broken Egg",

It took forever for our order to be taken and our food to arrive, and it wasn't too busy.   I ordered the baked green tomatoes to start, and I enjoyed them. The peanut garnish was tasty, but I do wish the tomatoes would've been crispier. I also ordered the bbq salmon plate and substituted the green beans for collard greens. I was excited for my choice, but the salmon was horrible. It didn't taste like it was cleaned well nor was it marinated long enough to have the ingredients settle. I ended up sending it back. The piece of the biscuit that I tried, was crispy yet soft, and I see why that's their main attraction. The greens were good, but the mashed potatoes were probably the tastiest thing on my plate. Either way, I couldn't eat any of it after I had a taste of the salmon. Totally turned off.",

After we were brought our drinks, we ordered and it took them another 30 minutes to bring us our food. It seemed like no one was getting good service.

The service is always excellent no Matter how busy they are. They always make sure that your coffee is filled and your water is too! My favorite is usually to try the specials they have, which are typically crepes, French toast or some kind of pancakes. My boyfriend always gets the Clifton omelette. When I don't get the special, I get a short stack of blueberry pancakes with the raspberry sauce and honey angelaise sauce to spread on top. It tastes like heaven! I always add a side of their crispy pork bacon and get a biscuit. The biscuits are perfectly flakey, warm and sprinkled with sugar on top. Add some butter and you will have yourself a delicious biscuit. Highly recommend for the food and service. Just try to get there early because they usually have a wait. They do have a bar you can sometimes find seating at.",

About 45 minutes into our party's time at the table, she threw the check on out table and 5 minutes later came back to began trying to clear our plates while we were still eating. She went so far as to try to take a fork out of one of our friends' hand. The friend said that they were still trying to eat, so the waitress proceeded to make comments to the bus boy about us dragging our feet.

Greetings etc. was fine.  Coffee was ok.  I got the high flyer.  I asked for eggs over medium.  They arrived less than over easy.  I did not eat them.  The whites were not even set.  Grits were ok.  A little too much cream in them.  Chicken sausage was too salty.  Oatmeal pancake was good.  Biscuit was dry.  Overall I can't recommend this place.  Maybe it was just my server and my cook.  I don't know.  I would have complained about the eggs, but my server never asked how my food was.  Servers were eating in my sight and there were two drinks on the counter belonging to the servers.  Both of these things were health violations,  With so many options in the south charlotte area, it will be some time before I return.  If at all.  Not a fan.  I don't know when restaurants in the area will stop resting on their laurels and counting on return customers.  All I wanted,this morning was friendly service and a tasty simple breakfast.  Denied.",

I ordered the High Flyer again, my usual order at both locations, and it was a wreck.    Service was friendly and attentive, as usual.  On a Friday night, there were two other tables seated, and they were finishing up when I sat down.  Both Biscuits refuse to fully air condition the restaurant, so it was as tropical as the table cloths.    The food: The eggs, cooked to over-well, were perfect.   The chicken sausage was over cooked and almost crunchy.  So overly seasoned that I woke up at 1 am and it felt like my chest was on fire from indigestion. The biscuit - well, I stated before how I feel about their biscuits.  Too heavy and really just a way to get the delicious apple cranberry butter into my pie hole. But at least it wasn't burned. I substituted a buttermilk pancake for the oatmeal pancake and it was burned AGAIN.  It's a pancake - if you burn it, throw it out and give me another one - it's not a steak, it's batter that probably costs less than a nickel.   The grits - my favorite grits - grits that make my mouth water every time I drive by this or the Park Rd location - were AWFUL.  Overly cheesed and overly salty, clumps of grits were stuck together - BAD.    As my Pawpaw said, during his final days, after spending the weekend with a family member that will make you wish death would come soon, \"I ain't goin' back\".",

The grits are the only thing that are alright, the meat that's not really meat that passes for turkey or real bacon is pathetic.  The biscuits are not good either, just b/c they put sugar on top doesn't make it good, sorry.  This place is highly overrated",

We chose to sit outside as the weather was so nice in the middle of March and really enjoyed ourselves.  Only pitfall was the manager - my voucher didn't have the dollar amount printed on it for some reason, so he tried to give me $15 off, instead of $30 which is what the voucher was for. We went back and forth about it, and he was not listening to me even though I had the email that stated it was a $30 value. I understood his side, but he really should of backed off and been more aware of the deals his restaurant is offering!  He finally took care of my entire bill, which was appreciated but he did say he was doing that because \"we just weren't understanding each other\". A little condescending if you ask me, but whatever.   Brunch could have been ruined if it weren't for our server (Juan I think) who cracked jokes and jokingly offered to punch the manager for me, since he wasn't being nice to me at first. His attitude and helpfulness was very much appreciated and we left a nice tip on our $0 bill =)   I will go back to Flying Biscuit, as the food is great but I probably won't visit this specific location again.",

The large biscuit with apple butter is good and flaky but not the best I've had. But the grits, oh the grits, are out of this world! They call them creamy dreamy grits, and that couldn't be any more accurate. Awesome, but prepare to pay $10 or more for breakfast. Everything on their menu could be a little cheaper in my opinion.",

Homemade apple butter on the tables, honey instead of high fructose corn syrup jams, meatless alternatives, creative entree choices, breakfast potatoes that are baked rather than fried, very good grits, good portion sizes, and chicken sausage that is very good.  My husband typically hates chicken sausage, but actually loved it at Flying Biscuit!  Their bacon is turkey bacon & it too, is good.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

My companion devoured the eggs, chicken sausage, potatoes (substituted the grits) and the pancake went to the little one who had no complaints.  So I think they were good, lol.  Turkey hash was very savory and was great with the medium eggs.  The biscuit that accompanies the meal was superb- living up to its name :)   The only negative was the coffee.  Not sure if I got the last cup or it just wasn't brewed correctly, but I had to send back the coffee and opted for water.  Service was okay- nothing outstanding.  Refills were never given, but order was taken in a timely fashion and food arrived without issue.  For all these reasons,  I'm giving 4 stars.",

Our waitress Tila is awesome very knowledgeable  of the menu and took great care of us( she gave us complementary coffee to go ) . I had the Eggs Benedict ... Wow what a dish. It was delicious , I had Eggs Benedict before but this was excellent. I have try it with a english muffin , but with a fluffy buttermilk biscuit was even better. The eggs was poached just right and the hollandaise sauce with pimento cheese elated my taste buds. The dish has a side of creamy grits, delicious.  I highly recommend this dish to anyone.

This having been the third time I've eaten here, but the first time alone. The rest of the food is medicore.   The crux to make it a place that I won't return to is that the staff kept talking about regular customers to other customers. If they liked them or not...some complaining...sometimes just chat, but ultimately and separate from if me or someone else was in agreement or disagreement with any of the comments...I'd rather not become a regular if the customers are the chosen topic of conversation...even if just a one time occasion.

    "text": "I'm removing 2 stars for disorderly conduct. We arrived here on a drizzly Sunday at about 11:40. We were met by 3 teenagers at the hostess booth who looked very overwhelmed despite only a few parties waiting. We were told the wait would be about 20 minutes for 2 people and we proceeded to stand within earshot of the hostess booth while other parties arrived and those who arrived before us were seated. Once it was about time to be our turn the hostess asked if we wanted to sit outside (it was raining) or sit at the bar. I let them know that since we should be next I would continue to wait. A couple more parties arrived and were told to wait until a woman jumps out of a car and asks how long the wait would be for 3 people and the hostess responded they could seat them right away!  I kid you not. At this point I'm staring in disbelief and then a couple minutes later they finally seat us at a table right next to another empty table and I look around and there are probably 5 other empty tables around us. This is totally not acceptable behavior at a restaurant, they need to hire a host/hostess who actually knows what they're doing.  On to the actual meal. We were greeted by our waitress right away and ordered coffee. After coming back with coffee we gave our orders and our food came out in less than 5 minutes. After listening to my husband complain about them not having any real bacon, we both were happily stuffed with brunch food. We were given our check but the waitress gave us the wrong ticket. She ran away and came back with the correct check. After waiting for probably longer than it took for our food to arrive we finally paid and were able to leave. It was a confusing and flustering dining experience and they really have some organizational issues to work out.",

Based on the food, you would think they would be used to being busy especially around noon. i chose the Meggxican Wrap and it was delicious. The side of potatoes were good, they had a little spice to them, but they seemed a little dry. i sampled some Pomodoro Chicken and would probably try that next time, it was tasty.   At a table of 6, everyone was happy with their food choice (even when one member of our party didn't get his side of french toast until the very end of the meal after a 2nd reminder, they were apparently still delicious. (4.5 stars worth), If we hadn't been a table in no rush to be anywhere and full of very patient people, i could see people getting upset with their service on this visit.   Price for three people came to around $33 plus tip. It was a fun place with great food. We'll probably try it again someday and perhaps at a less busy time, they'll get the 4 stars their food deserves.",

    "text": "My husband and I ordered take-out from this restaurant which was our first time eating here. There was only one number listed on their menu but when we went to go pick up our order, they said they didn't have any order for us. The hostess said that number was for their Southpark location. WEIRD! Why would they have one number listed on their menu with no location information? How is one to know that it was for another location? So we re-ordered. They were able to get us our order very quickly.  I gave this place 3 stars but I really would have preferred to give them 4. The reason they only received 3 stars is because their dining room is really small and their staff isn't very organized or friendly. This is a very busy restaurant (Ballantyne area) and the minute you walk in the hostess station is staring you in the fee. This  causes a traffic jam of people going in different directions in and out of the door. People sit there with the door open not able to allow others to walk out. The hostess was a deer in headlights and wasn't friendly at all.  On a good note, the food was fantastic. I ordered the Orange French Toast with raspberry sauce and an order of the sage chicken sausage. Although, there wasn't anything orange about it which was disappointing. The French Toast itself was just ok but the sauces made up for it. My husband got the fried egg sandwich with potatoes and biscuit. Everything was very fresh and delicious. I would say that if you can handle rude people and crowds, you have to eat here since the food is good. I would prefer to eat it in my car to not have to deal with the people and dining room.",

Perhaps if I went here for breakfast, but if this place is \"so great\" about its breakfast fare, 1) why serve anything other than breakfast menu? and 2) why be open to serve dinner?

And the waiter...or should I say waiter, waiter-manager and owner. Can I not be hounded by everyone as they walk by our table?  I've never had someone ask me, \"How do you want your fish cooked?\" at a restaurant.

    "text": "The Flying dry and hard Biscuit. Where the customer is wrong   Good Afternoon,   My wife and I came there to have a birthday breakfast. Upon arriving we were told to sit anywhere so we did. Our waitress got us coffee then took 15 minutes to get our order. By the way you should make fresh coffee and perhaps taste it before giving it to your guest. Finally we get to place our order. My wife got the flying biscuit breakfast. The only edible item on the plate were the eggs, even though they were over scrambled. The house potatoes were mushy and cold. I got the high flyer. I ordered my eggs over easy and they were way under done. So I told the waitress politely. Her response was \"well those are over easy and the whites should be runny like that, you should get them over medium because that is probably what you wanted\". First off, never respond that way to a clients complaint. 2nd don't try and tell someone they don't know what they are ordering. Your chicken sausages that are supposedly your signature. I didn't know that signature means frozen from a package. The biscuits were like biting into chalk. They   are dry and hard. I still got charged for my breakfast and also had to tell the waitress she forgot to charge for the OJ. Her response was \"I always do that if someone orders something during there meal\". I didn't know that I only had 1 time to order and thats final. My fault once again.  With all that being said the manager was never made aware of our problem. Not once did he come over and ask how is everything.  Whats funny about that is he was expediting food so you would think he would have seen a re fire. Uh oh no COMMUNICATION. If your expo, you are the last line of defense to make sure the food goes out properly and hot. Or is your manager just a worker. I can fix the problems let me know.

We ate here on Sunday morning two weeks ago. We were seated outside on the patio (our mistake due to the scorching heat) and no one acknowledged us for at least 15-20 mins. We saw many other tables over the course of our meal receive the same treatment (ignored).   The server who finally acknowledged us to take our drink orders was super rude and not at all pleasant. The sweet tea tasted terrible. We first incorrectly received unsweet tea, only then to nicely ask if we could get sweet tea. The sweet tea was not any better--- sour. It was probably another 30 mins before the food came out. It felt like an eternity.  The food we received was nothing short of awful. I really try to be kind, but the 'healthy sausage' (only sausage option they had) was completely impossible to even chew. The biscuits were rock hard. I could go on and on, but nothing was good. For the prices they charge, I expect the food to at least be halfway decent.  The food was also very cold.  I have been to other Flying Biscuit Cafe's in other cities, and they have been decent. They at least bring a warm basket of biscuits while you wait. If I were you, I would stay away from this place. This business will not survive if they continue on this track.",

When I asked if I could substitute Collard Greens in place of the included salad I was met with annoyance.  Upon receiving our meals, Shrimp and Grits and the Black Bean Quesadilla, Renee did not serve the \"infamous mile-high biscuits\" until we had to ask for them!  The were undercooked, underwhelming and dry- served with nothing but the apple butter that was in a squeeze-bottle on the table.      My dish should have been labeled \"Grits with Shrimp Garnish\" while my friend's dry quesadilla had a garnish of a completely inappropriate sweet sauce on top, no salsa and extremely dry, tasteless, salty potato cubes, possibly straight from the Cisco frozen section.  When Renee was asked if a side of salsa was possible we were given a hot tiny container of tomato pomodoro sauce-  the farthest thing from salsa imaginable.     The collards were basically inedible and were seasoned with so much MSG-laden spice that I immediately had a coughing fit-  no hint of bacon or ham as one would expect from southern greens.  Renee and another server simply snickered in the back of the restaurant at this and never replenished drinks or water.      We were never offered dessert but rather presented with the check and lamely told about some charity \"cherry\" on some random desert by Renee.  I would never go back to this \"restaurant\" due to quality of food and there-lack-of of service!",

The interior feels like a Cracker Barrell, complete with small tables and uncomfortable chairs.  Our table was in a back dark corner near the kitchen door, so it was loud and busy.  The breakfast I ordered has a little bit of everything on it, so I could try it all.  To be honest, I have had a better breakfast at IHOP.   The eggs were super dry, the pancakes were even drier, and had no flavor, the bacon was undercooked and skimpy, and oddly enough, the biscuits were hard like rocks and so dry that no amount of butter would rescue them. Even the hash browns/home fries were undercooked and boring.  For the price and the crowds, there are dozens of breakfast places in this area that are WAY better.  Still not sure what all the hype is about....have all you people in line not tried any place else???",

For me, anyway. Despite the awesome tomatillo salsa and black bean cakes smothered in Queso Fresco. Even though we had a great waitress. This style of food is being purveyed by a number of places in Charlotte, often less expensively, by culinary entrepreneurs, so I guess my question is, why go to a chain?",

The eggseptional eggs are so good you'll want to slap your mother (who ever decided to put tomatillo salsa on eggs deserves a comendation).  I'm sure I will get some flack for this, but the biscuit is the most disappointing part of the meal- way to bready, like they weren't friends with butter.  The rosemary potatoes make up for the biscky though.  Now all they need to do is open one that isn't in the stupid suburbs...",

I arrived one minute before my friend and the waitress hollered from the bar area to the door where I stood waiting to be seated \"just one?\" I realized she was \"speaking\" to me and I indicated there would be two. She hustled me to a table and promptly left. Another server (not sure of his name) brought me a water and anticipated that my friend may want a water too. My friend arrived as he delivered my water and asked what she would like to drink and she opted for water(which he anticipated). My friend and I began talking as we hadn't seen each other in quite some time. Susan, our server, came about one minute after my friend sat down and asked if we were ready to order. We asked for another minute. Fifteen minutes later Susan finally decided to come back and take our order. She gave me different option to pick from for the meal I order without telling me there was an uncharged for the bacon or that if I order fruit for which she gave me the choice I wouldn't get the grits that the menu stated clearly came with my meal. Our meal came promptly. Our server never came back to the table until she tried to take my friends meal in which she wasn't even finished eating. I had to ask another server to fill my water which I had been sucking dry for about five minutes already. Susan may have wondered why she didn't receive a decent tip from me, well if I had received decent service from her she would have gotten a decent tip. She didn't even deserve what she got. Not sure that I'll be visiting The Flying Biscuit any time in the near future!",

I did not like my biscuit - it lacked flavor and was dry.   The chicken sausage was meh and the eggs were burned.  The grits were pretty good but nothing to write home about.  The service wasn't particularly great either.    On a side note, I was a little disappointed they have only turkey bacon on the menu.  I rarely eat bacon but definitely enjoy a nice thick slab of it with breakfast every now and then.  Turkey bacon just doesn't do it for me.",

For those of you living in Ballantyne, you know that there is a horrible lack of breakfast places, so we do with what we have.    First, the biscuits are not good, nor do they fly.  They aren't really like biscuits at all, actually.  I have tried the shrimp and grits, scrambles, straight egg breakfasts, and black bean cakes.  The grits are creamy and heavy, not bad if you don't mind the richness.  The black bean cakes were pretty good, everything else was just okay.  I usually don't let surroundings get to me, but I kinda have with this place.  I find myself eating here often because of my veggie Mom and friends that enjoy it..  I never seem to like it for some reason...     You know what it is?  It's that this restaurant is a corporate version of something that I really like... the neighborhood hippie diner.   There are a lot of businesses that do this really well and I guess I was expecting that.",

Firstly, the menu- lots of good alternative, healthy offerings of traditional breakfast fare (think turkey bacon and whole-wheat pancakes). Which was a nice change. Other than that, not too much to rave about here. The food, while good, was overpriced for what it was.   Secondly, service. Service was quick, but not terribly attentive after we received our food (we went a long period without drink refills).  In all they weren't bad and I'm glad we finally gave them a try- but I doubt we'll be in any hurry to go back. My breakfast cravings lean much more toward the Park 51 Cafe, closer to home.",

Maybe folks in the south are spoiled with breakfast spots unlike I am in the Midwest - but damn ya'll, this place is outstanding. First off, the whole menu is served all day long.   I decided to start of with a Sledgehammer, nice name for a drink with four shots of espresso. This thing was a perfect fix for my late evening and early morning (not my idea to get up early!) I sat on the patio and fired up the laptop (yes, free wifi) to send off a few emails.   The service was great, attentive and friendly. I got the High Flyer over-easy which comes with an array of vegetables, a few eggs, a biscuit (duh!), grits and a pancake with peach compote. My reason for the early morning ordered the shrimp and grits & a bowl of tomato basil soup. Sounded a bit odd to me too, given the 830a hour.   The food came quickly and was served piping hot! +1! I enjoyed everything on my side of the table even the grits which seem to be made different in every part of the country. Even the lower carolina doesn't make them the same as NC. The biscuits didn't wow me nor disappoint me, and are served with a spicy jam.   I will be back again - I think. Unless there are just that many good breakfast stops in Charlotte. If this is one of the least appetizing, I can't wait to sink my teeth into the best!",

The grits are the BEST grits I have ever tasted and I have converted many anti-grit northerners with these grits.

Due to my diet, I'm usually stuck with two dishes here: The salmon, or the Cajun egg scramble. [Subbing out the grits or potatoes] Typically when they screw up, its with the salmon. It seems that they can cook it perfectly, or they can dry it out like none other. Additionally, it seems there is a bad system about getting biscuits out at the right time. When I first started coming here, the biscuits came out before the meal, but that only happens half the time now. [The other half is that they come out with the meal]  Tip: If you get the Cajun egg scramble, ask for it to be without the sour cream. The sour cream dampens the spice.  Reader's note: I've eaten here more than 15 times. Its not the worst place in the world, but they sure could fix the consistency issues.",

We were greeted by the hostess at the outside hostess stand (good thing it wasn't raining) and promptly seated. Our food was very good. My guest had the veggie scramble (she loved it) and I had the warm chicken salad. Crazy ordering a salad after a race but it's one of my favorite entrees on the menu. Their biscuits are good definitely NOT your typical Southern Biscuit. They are light and fluffy but not buttery, more on the dry side and sprinkled with sugar. They are very good with honey. I can't comment on the Apple Butter because I don't like Apple Butter. I think of AB to be a crime against nature. I like apples in their natural form. So with that being said, we did not ask for it BUT I have heard nothing but great things about the AB, if that's what you are into.  The service was not great yesterday. It's been better in the past. We had to ask repeatedly for more coffee and water. We also had to swipe a bowl of creamers from another table because our waitress was nowhere to be found and we had to ask for honey. And last but not least we had to take our check up to the bar to pay because again the waitress was nowhere to be found. I would have cut her some slack had the place been busy but by this time the breakfast crowd was gone.",

One big positive I can say is that the kid's menu is excellently priced, though portions reflect that. But still, not bad for kid's menu.  Unfortunately, I can't say I was impressed with my meal, or the wife with her's. I had the biscuits and gravy and it just wasn't that great to me. I'd say everything was fine, somewhat plain. The thing that threw me off was the biscuit had a sugar top and it mixed poorly with the rest of the meal. Just off-putting to me, maybe that's their signature thing though. The grits that came with the meal were great though.   Overall, just think there are better places out there. I likely won't be back, but not because of the service or staff.",

    "text": "It's been 4 months since I last tried this popular South Charlotte joint. My four prior experiences had all been disappointing and my review reflected that; however, I really want to like this place. So here it goes again...  I went for lunch and ordered day Love Cakes once again from their incredibly appealing menu. They serve breakfast and lunch by the way. For the first time, they arrived hot and tasty. The dish is topped with red onions, sour cream, a light salsa and an excellent tomatillo sauce. It comes with a salad but I ordered the fried mac and cheese instead. Very original and very popular. The biscuit itself was hot and delicious.  My friend ordered two eggs over turkey hash from one of the best breakfast menus around. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash was superb. I may order it again myself.  Unfortunately, the service was still lacking, which I think was simply due to being understaffed. They had an impressive 97 sanitary rating and the atmosphere is very cozy. They also have excellent outside seating.  Very pleased with the improvements from my last visit here, it's like I said this place is only a half a mile from home, I really want to like it. It's not Gotta Try yet, but I do look to trying it again soon.",

The place is small, and was very busy, but that is to be expected on a Sunday morning in Charlotte. The restaurant has a very eclectic and cozy feel. I ordered the two eggs, biscuit and gravy combo and it was amazing. The gravy is made with chicken sausage, which I was initially not sure about but it is some of the best gravy I've ever had on biscuits. The biscuits were also made perfectly, crunchy on the outside but so soft on the inside, you can cut them with a fork. Will definitely return!",

I don't know if I came on a bad day but the service and the food was well below expectations. I was seated immediately upon arriving, however it took about 15 minutes for someone to take my drink order. Then another 10 minutes for a different waitress to take my food order. If the restaurant had been busy it would have been understandable. I ordered turkey bacon because I don't eat pork, but was still given pork bacon. I sent it back, instead of them making another plate, they removed the pork bacon replaced it with turkey. At this point I was overwhelmed with how long it took and my food. I got a to go plate and ended up throwing the food away. A waste of time and money",

I love their creative menu, and the fact that it's very vegetarian-friendly.  If you avoid red meat, you can still enjoy the chicken sausage or turkey bacon.  (Nice to feel guilt-free after eating sausage and bacon!)  Not only is the food delish, but it's a great value for huge portions.  Almost every meal includes one the the famous 'flying biscuits' which is sprinkled with sugar. Yummmm!  The Flying Biscuit does offer lunch and dinner--the shrimp and grits is a personal fave--but breakfast is their forte.  I'd say that anyone who hasn't absolutely loved this place, hasn't tried the breakfast.  Go for the best they offer and you will not be disappointed!",

Anyway, we had a fairly short wait and were seated - service here is usually pretty good. They realize that you don't mess with someone on short sleep who needs coffee (or kids who need their milk and biscuit stat!)  Kids ordered chocolate chip pancakes and the chicken sausage patties (both very tasty!). I ordered the Clifton omlette with the heavenly grits and my better half ordered the Hollywood omlette, also with the grits. These grits are sublime, they actually make people crave them! The omlettes were both very good (especially the tomato sauce that comes with both!) Of course we all got the biscuits, which are giant and come with spicy apple butter (I'm a fan)  Price-wise this place isn't cheap, which is my main objection - my personal opinion is that breakfast should never be more than $10/pp and Flying Biscuit blows that premise. However, the food can't be beat and they offer enough healthy options that you feel good eating there.",

I went there for lunch with some coworkers and was pretty excited because they catered an event at my apartment place and was pleasantly surprised that the food was not mediocre. I thought eating at the restaurant would be an awesome experience. My high hopes were shall we say slightly crushed. I ordered the tofu salad with potatoes and honestly I have had better. I guess I will need to head over to the plaza midwood area to get better vegetarian food. My salad was supposed to come with a biscuit but to my disappointment they forgot to give me one. The waitress did come and asked if everyone one received a \"cathead\" but by this time my yearning for a tasty biscuit disappeared. I must have had \"no biscuit for me\" stamped on my forehead that day.   The restaurant atmosphere was pleasant and welcoming. The waitress kept our drinks promptly refilled and our orders were correct. This is not always easy to do when you have a group of six or moreI. I just wish the service matched the taste of the food. I will give it another go but will have to try something else on the menu.

The wait wasn't that long when we first got there and were seated within about 10 minutes. The colorful ambiance of the restaurant is nice and many people seemed to just be enjoying the company of others around them. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and helped us pick what would go best with our grits.  I must admit, the grits here were simply amazing! It was a great place to have my first grits experience. The service was quick and we were in and out of there relatively fast. We both got breakfast with our grits and it was delicious. A great treat in the South!",

The Chicken Club Wrap and potatoes were better though nothing to write home about.  Atmospere a little cramped and cutsy.

When we were at Flying Biscuit last week, everything was as it had been once upon a time: The old servers were back, the food was done correctly, the kitchen was humming. Maybe we caught them in a bad spell a few months ago when everything seemed out of kilter for them, or maybe Bobby Ewing just stepped out of the shower.  Anyway, two stars are back on and the recommendation couldn't be any heartier.",

Here it is in a Charlotte suburban mall area.  Strange, but the food is fantastic, southern style bistro/brunch.  There are tons waiting but they get people in and out and without feeling rushed.  They accommodated two toddlers and some nervous parents...in a cramped space.  It was WELL done. Excellent service.  My shrimp and grits were...yummy...not like incredible...but very good.  I'd go here again if visiting the in-laws.",

As someone who was raised on grits, sweet tea & livermush, I find it a little mediocre.  One more thing, the service is great but the wait is long and the sound is deafening in there. it's a small place so be ready for some human contact!",

Straight from the airport, my bro-in-law brought us to The Flying Biscuit.  Fried green tomatoes to start with an Espresso Stout (Guinness + espresso shot) on the side, delicious!  Then the Cajun Chicken omelet with a dash of the Texas Pete hot sauce--phenomenal! Biscuit was great (of course) but did not fly well ;) Friendly service, fantastic food!

The English muffin was soggy and the crab cake was gritty, soft and floury. When the waitress asked how was everything I told her I was disappointed and she offered to come back with the menu so I could order a different breakfast which I did. So I ordered eggs over and chicken sausage. All good except the biscuit was not as soft  warm and fluffy  as was in our last visit and in my opinion  was day old as the outside texture hard. My dining mate enjoyed his eggs and chicken sausage, potatoes and pancake. The waitress was very accomodating. All places have their off days with menu items. Maybe today was just that.",

The only negative thing that I need to say is that when you must wait for at least 20-45 minutes, to have a space (anywhere, even bar), the girls that are usually outside calling people, make a mess.  Today we said: party of two. Even counter/bar. Some people that might be after you, probably will be sit down before. After 15-20' she called us, and of course, there was enough space in the bar, however we were sat in a small table inside, near the restrooms. That's why my 4 *.  Austin, our waiter, was very knowledgeable about  the menu. He made some suggestion, that save us some bucks. Came to check our table many times.  I ordered a latte. Actually was super small for the price, so never again. But our breakfast was absolutely amazing.   We left happy and with leftovers. And that's all I asked.   Totally recommend The Flying!  Great food, excellent customer service.   Thank you Austin!",

I took a couple pics of the ceiling tiles that had each little square painted differently. The bar had twinkle lights strung across.   The waitress was very nice and even the bus boy came by to refill our coffees. Good service. Prices are pretty standard for a nice breakfast place. Good size portions. The coffee was good as well, and I'm picky with my coffee. I like it strong so if you serve me weak coffee it's not worth drinking. This coffee was pretty good.   I didn't feel like ordering a whole meal so I ordered a side of bacon and a side of grits. The bacon was perfectly crispy without being burnt and had good flavor. The grits - this is why we came here to begin with. Our family we were staying with raved about their grits so we had to try them before heading back home. I'm not typically a grits fan but these were so creamy! I feel like they may have cream cheese blended in or something! I would eat these all the time if I lived here.   My husband ordered an omelet. That's his go to and it was pretty standard as most are but good sized. I tried a piece of his biscuit just because I felt obligated given the name of the cafe. I didn't care for it but to be fair I'm not a biscuit lover to begin with. Everyone else liked them. Would come back here again.",

It was always out perfect brunch spot for fantastic biscuits, fluffy pancakes, and creative healthy options. This flying biscuit is just the same, very colorful, amazing waitstaff (Russell was our new best friend by the tine we left!) and last but not least, the food is spectacular! Can't wait to go again during our next NC trip! Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Came here for a weekend brunch and made it before the crowd. It's a small place, but luckily, we hardly had to wait. I had the Smoked Salmon Scramble (3 eggs scrambled with smoked salmon and dill cream cheese, served with grits and a biscuit, $10.49). Boyfriend had the Breakfast Bowl (2 oven-fried green tomatoes, turkey bacon, and 2 over-medium eggs, served atop a bowl of grits and topped with salsa, $10.99). I see what the rave is all about with the grits; it's so creamy and delicious! Grits has grown on me, and even though there were no shrimp in my grits, I still fell in love with it! My scramble was good, not great. The eggs were nice and fluffy, but I wish my biscuit was soft and warm instead of dry and crumbly. After having a couple spoonfuls of my boyfriend's meal, I'd say his meal was the winner. Service was good. Food arrived very quickly. There are tons of other options on the menu, and I'm looking forward to trying out the others.",

Service deserves five stars as our server, Lindsey was outstanding! Friendly, attentive, helpful and made the best mimosas we've had (the servers make the drinks). She checked on us several times during the meal and my coffee cup never got less then half empty.  The food did not quite live up to expectations but was not bad. I ordered the High Flyer. My eggs were cooked hard instead of over medium and we all did not care for their slightly spicey chicken sausage, but that's a personal preference. Their creamy, dreamy grits were delicious and the name sums them up perfectly! My meal also came with a thick oatmeal pancake with peach compote which was good, but dense and not fluffy. Of course, our meal came with two huge biscuits. The all thought the biscuits were a bit heavy and dense. Each table has bottles of cranberry applesauce which we poured over the biscuits. The applesauce is very good with just the right mix of cranberry to add flavor without being overpowering or too tart.",

Then came a biscuit that had such a hard crust, not even the gravy would make it soft ...

The total experience was great, however the lack of PORK meat choices got them 4 instead of 5 stars. I must be honest and say the turkey bacon in my Southern Scramble was more than enough to satisfy my picky palette. I highly recommend the scramble!  The overall menu is large and breakfast is sold All Day. So yes, you can roll out of bed anytime and have Flying Biscuits. The biscuits are not really biscuits, they look more like rolls with a biscuit interior; this could be a little unusual for some. I had mine with apple cranberry butter and it was delish. I recommend you try them at least once.",

Every time I took a bite, it just crumbled in my plate.  I also tried the \"Fried Green Tomatoes\" and was very disappointed. Completely lack luster, oily and undercooked.

The sauces were yummy, the french toast itself not very impressive, and altogether it was a little on the sweet side but good. ($7)   My husband had the eggs-travaganza. He loved the grits, but they only offer turkey bacon and what I think is chicken sausage. It's nice to have that option but it would be better if traditional options were offered too, which my husband would have preferred. Eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuit and half order of French toast was around $9.50 or so. I am mentioning the prices since their website doesn't show them, which is a bad restaurant habit that I hate.  Our server was very friendly, but bringing out the food was rather disorganized and we got the wrong thing first. They fixed that quickly though.  Altogether the place was fine but not really memorable and had the distinct feel of a chain. It is located in the Stonecrest mall near the Nothing but NOodles place (we had trouble locating the Flying Biscuit for a while).",

It's always been one of my favorite chain restaurants, and it doesn't even feel like a chain unless you know that multiples exist.  Service is friendly and attentive... even after the last time we went, when I accidentally elbowed our waitress in the stomach.  No crying or cursing; she very graciously accepted my apology and continued on.  I felt horrible and left her an extra-big tip, by the way.  The food isn't cheap, but it's not outrageously expensive, either.  You can get a breakfast with an egg dish, grits, and a biscuit for about $8.  Are people really complaining that's too expensive?  I must be eating in the wrong places, because that seems pretty dang reasonable to me.  For breakfast, I usually get either the Meggixcan Wrap, which has just the right amount of early-morning heat, or the Piedmont Omelet, which actually makes turkey bacon sound good.  Speaking of turkey, if you're going for dinner, you *must* try the turkey meatloaf.  Probably the best I've had: moist and topped with salsa... delicious.  The sides are good too.  The biscuits are lighter than the usual southern fare, but I think they're good, and the grits are indeed a creamy dream.    The only downside to this location is that it's small.  This leads to short waits during peak hours and to elbowing waitresses in the stomach.   I am sorry I elbowed you in the stomach, Flying Biscuit Waitress.",

    "text": "Yes, it's a chain. You wouldn't know it, though, except that the ceiling tiles are screen printed instead of hand painted with winged biscuits and other such culinary literalisms. For some reason, that element makes the Charlotte locations smell of franchise. Otherwise, the interiors do a decent job pushing the pretense that the restaurant is in a converted bungalow near those of the original Biscuit in Atlanta's Candler Park, or that it is a hometown diner that has been there for years instead of doing business in Charlotte's newer and oldest shopping centers.  Lines form on weekend mornings with people salivating over the breakfast served all day on Fiestaware, especially the biscuits sprinkled with sugar and served with homemade cranberry apple butter. And those grits. Those creamy, dreamy grits that made this lifelong grits detester see the light at the end of the hominyless tunnel. Grits can and should be made with heavy cream. If they aren't, they aren't worth eating.  Lunch and dinner options are as tasty as those from the breakfast all day menu; many are altered with eggs or the lack thereof to make them appropriate for the time of day. Case in point: Egg-Ceptional Eggs and Love Cakes, both of which are in the Top Five Favorites dishes of this writer. Daily specials are posted on the boards outside, and are usually worth a try. Menu substitutions are easy, and so is the staff, which in general is pleasantly attentive.  Though it is not a Charlotte original, we'll claim it as our own, if only for those devilishly alluring grits.",

This poor service continued throughout, no one checking for drink refills or to see if we needed anything else.  Meanwhile that table that got served before us (same number of people at the table) finished and was out the door about 15 minutes before us.  The only negative on the food was that I got a scramble with a side of roasted potatoes not knowing that the scramble included hashbrowns. The roasted potatoes were outstanding whereas the hashbrowns were old, fried, and very greasy. What a shame! Ask to sub roasted potatoes for hashbrowns. You wont be disappointed.",

I'd rate it a 4 on the food but because of the attitudes and nastiness  of the waiters and waitresses i give it a 1 star. Having to deal with this type of service is horrible and is a terrible atmosphere to walk into when im trying to grab breakfast with family. Its a shame since this place is great but i would not recommended it unless you're okay with dealing with snobby service and continuously begging to get a refill on water.",

And I was worried when we walked in and the restaurant was pretty slow for 730pm. Our waitress, Amanda, assured us with a wink that we had perfect timing and beat the rush. She went over some of the popular menu items and extended a recently expired discount on our ciders, off to a good start!   My bf and I ordered the 3b Chicken sandwich and the bbq salmon. Our food came out within 10 minutes and looked awesome. The salmon was nicely seasoned and the coke bbq sauce was very tasty. But the shining star on my plate was the green beans! They had this smoky garlic flavor to them that had me hooked. I would go back just to get a plate of them. My bf loved his chicken sandwich, especially since they use turkey bacon. We always take a portion home for lunch the next day, and even reheated the food held it's flavor.  Overall, the service was quick and pleasant! And the food was delicious and at a price point that we'll be returning very soon! From what I read in previous reviews, if the service was lacking for you, then this place definitely deserves a second chance.",

I got the goat cheese and pesto omlette with a side of potatoes and a biscuit, and the boy got a pancake with a side of grits.   My omlette was so delicious!  I usually offer the Boy a bite but it was so good I didn't want to share.  It had roasted tomato sauce on it and it was filled with Goat cheese.  Ah-Maze-ing. The potatoes were very good and exactly what I was expecting, the biscuit came with sugar sprinkled on top which was so delicious and so NOT what I was expecting.    The Boy's pancake was the best pancake I've ever tasted in my 30 years on this Earth.  Hands down.  I would come back for the pancakes alone. His creamy grits were very good and a kind we hadn't tried before.    The atmosphere was very noisy and it was VERY small, the tables were packed in so tight it was tough to get in and out of your seat.  But because of the food quality it was worth it.",

But I still liked them.   The food that everyone else ordered was only okay. If you eat the biscuits on their own, they were SUPER dry and crumbly. (The apple butter made this a little more bearable). The grits were okay. Not the best texture.   I had to knock off another star because there were flies EVERYWHERE. They kept landing by us.

For those of you that dont enjoy brekafats, mush like myself, there are plenty of non breakfast items.  With that being said I actually enjoyed the breakfast items more than the lunch items.  The biscuits were different than what you traditionally expect.  The apple butter was delish!  The sausage gravy was to die for but it is much different from traditional sausage gravy.  The gravy tastes more like stuffing due to its punch of flavor (i could taste a lot of rosemary).  Ive only ate grits a few times as I am not from the south but these grits were unbelievable!  Go for the grits no matter what!  The chicken sandwich I ordered was a chicken sandwich.  The steak breakfast is well worth the money as you actually get a thick steak cooked perfectly opposite of the flat freezer steak you get at most breakfast restaurants!  Overall this is a must go with prices that are reasonable but not cheap.",

However, I give this place four stars because they have some very solid breakfast offerings.  Plus, this is just about  the only  place close by that truly offers breakfast all day, which is a good thing if you love b-fast as much as me & David do!  Another thing that I like about FBC is that you can get Chicken sausage or turkey bacon instead of pork without paying an up-charge (like you have to do at Skillets).    Also, if  you really don't want grits, you can ask for potatoes instead.   (However, their grits are quite good - not runny & tasteless like so many places!)  I think it sounds weird, but I really like the \"Pasta, Sausage, and Eggs\" which is made of eggs scrambled with chicken sausage, penne pasta, spinach, mushrooms, and cheddar cheese.  It rocks!",

So we went back the next day, too.  That's why I was excited that Charlotte was getting one a couple of years later.    We arrived at the Flying Biscuit in Stonecrest on a Sunday before the church crowd let out.  Unfortunately, it wasn't early enough.  We had about a 30 minute wait.  After our name was finally called, we discovered why.  The restaurant didn't have a lot of seating and we were squooshed by a table right near the front door.    The menu items were just as good as in Atlanta; they tend to be more organic and/or vegetarian in their food offerings.  However, this Flying Biscuit didn't have the same ambiance as the first one in Atlanta that I experienced, and I guess that really makes the difference.  In Atlanta, the restaurant was filled with an eclectic group of people.  In Charlotte, it was filled with soccer moms and dads who arrived via minivan.  I do want to go back to give the Charlotte location another try, but maybe I'll try lunch or dinner instead and treasure my brunch in Atlanta.   p.s. Their biscuits ARE delicious no matter where you go, though!  :)",

    "text": "Traveled to NC to visit a friend and she took me to this place. She explained that the biscuits and grits (which I had never had) were amazing. She was 100 percent right! The place is very quaint and unique, which I loved. They seemed to be very busy, which was a great sign for the business. We waited for around 20 minutes and it was definitely worth the short wait time. The apple butter that goes on the biscuits could be addictive, if I lived closer. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area or visiting.",

    "text": "I've been here for both breakfast and dinner. I prefer their dinner entrees - I think most any place can make breakfast food but their main courses are a real treat. The shrimp and grits and biscuit pot pie are my favorite winter time comfort foods. Huge portions = leftovers for lunch the next day! And don't skip putting apple butter on your biscuit - it's like a little complimentary dessert! Small interior isn't conducive to larger parties (plan to pull over a chair for more than 6 people). Friendly staff, unstuffy atmosphere, quick service.",

    "text": "What can you say about Flying Biscuit cafes? They are all yummy. The prices are always a little steep for some basic eggs but the dense biscuits make up for it. If you like thick thick heavy biscuits with sprinkled sugar on top, you will adore these biscuits. If you are into the fluffy flaky biscuits, this is NOT for you. Actually the same goes for their oatmeal pancake. Totally great for you if you want to fill up before a long drive or will not eat again for 5+hours. But if your tummy reacts to coffee the way some do, make sure a stall is close by. Haha They are fiberlicious. The grits are what i prefer because they are made with cheese and cream. Again...stall close by. (smile). Now as far as lunch here, I cannot speak on it as I prefer breakfast food morning, afternoon and evening. The tables at this location are jammed together so that is why 4 stars. Weird because they stufd you like an ihop crepe but then expect you to walk sideways to your seat. (smile) The waitstaff has been cool here too. Kind of a grunge feel too. Think of your coolest pizza grunge spot with the guy with the giant holes pierced through his lobes complete with skully...now apply this look to breakfast in Ballantyne.",

Pimento cheese and delicious hollandaise adorned the top were excellent.  The oatmeal pancake was tasty but somewhat dense but I suppose that is to be expected.  Overall for the price and service it would definitely be a place I return and bring others!",

Tried the apple butter that is on the table, while good didn't have that butter taste more like apple pie filling. Not a bad thing just not what I expected.  Tried the grilled mac and cheese and was not that impressed. I had the chicken pot pie, which was more like a soup then a pot pie. I make better at home. My husband had the black bean and cornmeal cakes, once again not impressed.    Service was acceptable,  food came out quick. Waitress was aware and attentive,  which one can appreciate.",

We came back in and were the only people standing at the hostess stand. There were multiple empty tables but it was still busy. The Hostess then looks at me and tells me that we have to wait outside because of \"fire code\" . Its raining outside. My head almost exploded. Ive never had anyone tell me I had to stand out in the rain for a table especially when we were the only people standing there. I dont even know what was going through these retards minds. If thats how you treat your customers Im not sure how they stay in business.",

    "text": "Nothing but the biscuits are original. And they are fair at best. Everything in this restaurant is packaged. All they do here is open packaging from bulk packing they ordered from the huge warehouse for restaurants. Even the honey for the biscuit came in the small package tube. Seriously wouldn't you think they would have fresh homegrown honey for their \"famous\" biscuits\". Coffee was terrible go across the parking lot and get FRESH GROUND from SB. I had to cut the vegetables in my omelet to make them bit size, so I could eat it. The staff was grumpy and our server at the bar was very unpleasant. Come on it is morning... who wants to be greeted that way first thing of the day",
