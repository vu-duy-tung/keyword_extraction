If you're walking in the front doors and expecting a 5-star meal, you might as well expect the same from one of the larger fast food chains in this great country.   If you choose to experience Steak and Shake, do so on a very empty stomach and then expect to take heartburn medicine and a nap.   Heavy, greasy, fatty and devoid of a healthy option. Again, quite expected. You might as well just walk in knowing that you're going to have to loosen your belt.   With that being said, you have to get a burger, dog, patty melt, whatever with fries. Their fries are so skinny and light. Not overdone like so many other places.   Also, you have to get a milkshake. What kind of experience would you be having at a truckstop-esque diner without a milkshake? Shame on you if you forego this option!  Look forward to leaving full, disgusted with yourself and ready for a small hibernation!",

I ordered a burger and a banana shake, and was quickly brought a glass of water, no utensils, no napkins (but who needs a napkin when eating a burger?).  Fast forward 40 minutes when my burger arrived.  It tasted ok, as good as any other time I've been to a franchise and was served within 10 minutes of placing my order.  After I finished eating, I sat waiting for the waitress to bring the check to see if she had charged me for the banana shake I never received.  After another 15 minutes I was brought the check, and as I'm walking to the register the another waitress comes at me with a melted banana shake.  I refused, paid my tab, and left, never to return.  It was the first time in my life I've left $0 for a tip.",

These were light and fluffy with a slightly crispy rim. Perfect. I went back the following day and they were just as good. These pancakes rivaled those at the Original Pancake House in Charlotte.

I also got the Parmesan & herb fries. Really good. But I'm a fry guy and the portion left MUCH to be desired. I know I coulda ordered another order but.....  They offer ROOT BEER!!!!

The bad things include the service at the drive through.  They don't seem to comprehend what you order.  I ordered an unsweet tea and I received a sweet tea.  Thankfully, this tea wasn't the deathly sweet kind of 20 parts sugar to 1 part tea like you get at most fast food places.  What I received was a lightly sweetened tea which was actually refreshing.

Most of my high school experience was spent watching movies at Carolina Pavilion with their then \"new\" stadium seating concept.  Man, I am old.    Anyways...  service was pretty quick and prompt and we got our orders and ate happily.  Our server actually saved me a couple of bucks if I ordered an extra slider... good tip on the wallet... bad on the waistline.  Pretty satisfied - good to know what you are getting into when you walk in the door.  Fast quick food, not necessarily the healthiest options, but the milkshakes make it all worth it (for me).",

    "text": "Decided to stop at the Steak  'n Shake on South Blvd after a afternoon of boating on Lake Wylie. The whole reason we stopped is that online it said that they had \"8\" good Vegetarian choices and since we had a Vegetarian with us, we decided to give it a go. We sat in line for around 15 minutes, but it was fine we were looking at the menu online. But Alas when we got to the order microphone we were unhappy to hear that not one of the \"8\" items they mentioned online did they have. They were supposed to have a Veggie Burger and a Vegetarian Melt. Nope....they had Cheese Fries they said, that's  all. So we had no choice but to order the cheese fries, and we ordered a couple of sandwiches. The cheese fries were just the small order of fries with some Cheese Whiz stuff on them, not hot but cool. I ordered a Frisco Burger which was two white pieces of bread with a couple of paper thin patties on them and a sauce that was like a tomato mayonnaise, the amount of grease was intense. The bread was suppose to be sourdough and thick but it was not. My husband got a Portobello and Swiss burger, his was probably the best, but also almost 7 dollars. I realize this is NOT a vegetarian place but usually in todays society with so many people opting out of red meat you would think they would have had an option, like they described online.  I remember when Steak'n Shake first came out it was really good....Not so much anymore!",

I asked if they ordered or anything and they said no. Not even a minute later the server came over and asked for our drinks. I opted this time to get a milkshake even in this weather, plus it was half price (between 2-5). I was sad they got rid of the fudge brownie so I got the chocolate chip cookie dough instead. I wish the server told me they just started there seasonal shakes because I absolutely LOVE peppermint and would have gotten that. The table we sat at did not have those paper \"place mats\" therefore I didn't see it on my own. I had the jalapeno crunch burger which is my go to there. It isn't too spicy but the spice is definitely there and I am sure if you want spicier, just ask for more jalapenos! Sometimes I get extra spicy mayo on the side to dip it in to add spice instead, this time I did. The fries are skinny cut and are always delicious thanks to the seasoning they have on every table. The server, Keith, was great. He was friendly and quick. He brought out our milkshakes right after the food came out (which was maybe 30 seconds) but the food came out fairly quick. It all looked delicious and it was hot and fresh! Keith came back after a couple of bites to check on us which is great and after we were finished eating he asked if we needed anything else as he cleared the table off. We asked for to go cups for our shakes and then went up front to pay, which he also cashed us out.",

Yes, they have plain old boring cheeseburgers, but they also offer a broad variety of toppings to satisfy the taste buds of every carnivore - mushrooms, guacamole, cheese (american or cheddar), BBQ style, even one they call \"The Royale\" which comes with bacon, cheese and a fried egg.  Fries are the thinner shoestring variety and they're not terribly greasy and are surprisingly not oversalted.  Service is hit or miss. I've heard horror stories of rude staff. Today, my waitress was just so good that I not only mentioned it to the manager, I called their customer \"complaint\" line and told them how great she was.  Steak n' Shake is open 24 hours. They have a sign on the door today that they're open on Thanksgiving Day, so perhaps if you burn the turkey and mush the mashed potatoes, you can come here instead.  Warning! The parking lot is very clearly marked as for SnS guests only. If the Lynx lot is full, you do NOT want to park here.",

I went to Steak and Shake, I saw that they had a combo, Chicago style hot dog, french fries and drink for $5. You can't beat that price. So I ordered, it's #16- if you need to get a quick fix.   It was definitely good, they cut the hot dog in half longways, grill it on the flat top, top it with all the appropriate fixin's for a Chicago dog. My french fries were hot, but shoestring french fries get cold really fast, so they had already been under the heat lamp a few minutes, then by the couple of minutes to park the car- not the best. So my french fry barometer registered a \"a nice tone of meh\"   The hot dog bun was too large and poofy, so way too much bread and it was sopping wet from pickle juice, so soggy bread is a turn off, and I don't mean damp either. it was smushed wet like a sponge. Yeah, smushed. Also it wasn't a poppy seed bun for the sticklers. Oh, and another thing, they grilled the bun, that was a nice touch.. My hot dog was made with care, not slapped together..   So, this being said, for five bucks and a quick dog, yes I will return.",

Well I had to keep repeating my order to the drive thru attendant,  for whatever reason just could get it right...finally when he repeated back what I actually wanted and the wait to get to the widow began. I waited and waited to get to the window.   When I finally got up there he handed me my milkshake and a footlong hotdog...I told him that that wasn't what I ordered but he insisted that the order was correct, I wasn't in the mood to argue I was too hungry....  The fries are supposed to be like shoestring fries but mine were cold and I didn't care for them at all. I'm a french fry lover so this was very disappointing.  The hot dog came overwhelmed with toppings onions, relish and ketchup...now normally I would be raving about an abundance of toppings but here they ruined the dog! The toppings overshadowed the flavor and made the bread wet...ugh I hate wet, soggy bread!   The only saving grace and reason for the 2 stars was the milkshake. It was creamy and came topped with whipped cream and a cherry....  Other than that I don't see myself running back here anytime soon.",

They only had 3 servers for a busy restaurant but that's no excuse for keeping up with cleanliness.",

I had to stand there and stare at the cashier as she had her head down the entire time I approached after about two minutes I turned to my daughter and said \"what are you having\" once my daughter answered me the cashier replied and said \"is that all\". I'm like \"What, I didn't even order I didn't know you were ready\". She replied \"Ooh well is that all?\"  I like to walked out because I can't deal with rude people who work in the service industry taking a job from a willing and able person who would LOVE to work and have a income.  The ONLY reason I stayed is because my teenager had been stressing me about a shake ALL DAY and I took her to fulfill her craving since I don't take her for dessert often as its not healthy.  I WILL NOT return here hopefully there is another place that I can convince her to like the shake at because this is our 2nd visit to this place and both times were VERY UNWELCOMING & RUDE and did I mention SLOW.",

When I showed it to the server, she apologized and stuffed the napkin with dead roach into her apron pocket and left to wait on another table. Now I know why they were almost empty. Disgraceful. Not even an offer of a discount. But I do not intend to go back there anytime soon. Terrible",

Although it was a couple minutes until we were sat - the server who sat us had a smile on her face.  We were waiting for a third person to join us, but she was literally two minutes behind us. The server doubled check how many guests we had (3), and came back with silverware - and by then the third guest joined us.  He greeted us politely, and asked if we were ready to order our drinks. Of course we had to get milkshakes - they were half priced! After a couple of minutes he came back and asked if we were ready to order our meals - and we did.  It did not seem that long before our food came out! It was all hot, and quick. The food did come out before the milkshakes, but they did come out right after the food. The chocolate milkshake was delicious! But it was so thick, I could not use the straw. I do like thicker shakes, but not that think - just my personal preference, nothing against SNS.  I also ordered the 3.99 double burger (which came with fries). The fries are thin and crispy, but yummy! The burger came with lettuce, tomato, mayo, pickles, ketchup and onions (no onions for me though). They are suppose to be thin burgers, but they were flavorful.   Overall, the food was yummy and the server (and everyone else we encountered) were very polite and welcoming!  P.S. Our server was Keith!",

I felt terrible for him. The drive through and dining room were inoperable. It looked like he was working in the store alone for at least a few hours. I came in at 11:30pm. I wouldn't have even gotten food but I was starving and had just worked 12 hours. You guys need to hire people or something because you are leaving your employee stranded.",

    "text": "My husband and I visited Steak'n Shake last week for the first time in years and I was not disappointed. First of all I forgot how cheap it is! We both got the Wisconsin Mushroom Swiss burger with fries ($4). You can now also get regular fries or add Cajan or Parmesan flavoring to them. I got the cajan fries and they were pretty good- but I think I'll stick with the regular next time as it was essentially a cajan salt seasoning they sprinkled on the fries- not tossed or cooked with.   As far as the burger goes it was awesome! It was cooked perfectly and the bun was soft, yet slightly crispy. I didn't get a milkshake because I didn't have the healthiest lunch, but they have a variety of flavors- including seasonal ones like pumpkin and egg nog so be sure to ask if they have a seasonal one next time you go.   Lastly, our server was nice and attentive. He made sure our waters were filled and took care of us.   Next time I'm in the area I'll consider Steak'n Shake again for a guilty, greasy lunch.",

And, to our surprise, nothing has changed. It was just as good as we remembered.  We arrived around 12:30 and the place was packed. However, we were greeted by a smile asking if we preferred a table or booth, booth no doubt. Once seated we were quickly approached by our waitress who took our drink order and gave us a few minutes to look at the menu. We both went with the original double steakburger, mine with cheese and fries.  OMG, the burgers were amazing.  Thin steak patties fries to perfection, served on a grilled bun with lettuce, tomato, onion and ketchup, mustard and mayo...the perfect combination.  The fries are great shoestring fries lightly salted.  My Mom ordered a chocolate milkshake which hit the spot. The service was spot on, the food amazing and I love that no matter how many SNS restaurants you go to they are set up the same way, old school diner style with people enjoying burgers and fries..",

There were not many places that were open so we chose Steak and Shake. I ordered classic double cheeseburger meal and a Oreo shake. The shake was amazing! So sweet. It reminding me of a Chick-fil-A shake. The burger was not impressive. Not seasoned and even the toppings weren't helping. The fries were horrible. I didn't even finish them. The staff was nice and the restaurant was very clean. Too bad I didn't like the food. I always heard great things about it.",

But very little meat.    Like the other comments. The wait was a long time. The service was nice but took a long time for the food.  Took a while to be seated or even acknowledged.  At least say something when we walk in the door.   I asked for an extra paper placemat because we were shorted. Never got it.  I asked for 3 straws. Got 2. However the server was polite and you could tell she was trying.   The food flavors were good. Burgers cooked just right. Of what I could tell.  It was clean. The shakes were the best thing. They were thick and creamy and delicious. They have so many combinations, you have top return just for those.   I think a good promo would be a shake sampler. There are so many to try. They could offer small cups of different shakes and shake combos.   It would really draw in larger parties.",
