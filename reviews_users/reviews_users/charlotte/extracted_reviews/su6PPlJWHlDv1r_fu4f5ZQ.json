The food is always great and delicious - I've tried the scallops, the Rueben sandwiches and one of my favorite is the beets salad. So tonight I decided to call in an order. The hostess answered and said her name was either kaitlyn or Katherine - and I put an order in & then asked her how much it was. She just simply said you will know when you get here then just said bye and hung up. What happened to the good customer service that service industry is supposed to have? So when I arrive - the same hostess is the person that takes the money and never said thank you after I paid and just said enjoy. I feel so unappreciated & not welcomed. Please fix the customer service with your hostess. Thanks and have a great day. The beets salad is amazing as always though!",

However, this felt like life before his diagnosis and such an enjoyable experience for him and no stress for me!! Our server Elizabeth was reassuring about accommodating for his allergies, so inviting, and never treated us as a nuisance which happens at a lot of restaurants. The service was amazing and the food was incredible and the drinks were so good too!! Our first time and definitely not our last. This will be our new go to for every family occasion. Thank you to you and your staff for going above and beyond! Now come down to fort mill!!",

I had heard of Burton's but had never been, so we decided to give it a try and I'm glad we did! My son had the California Chicken Sandwich and I had the Reuben and we both declared them the best of their kind that we'd ever had. We both tried each other's sandwich and agreed on the #1 rating. Our server (Madison, I think? I'm not great remembering names) was super friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and always attentive. I know this is a small chain but it doesn't feel like it. Great food, great service, good music and a generally cool vibe make it a place we'll return to soon!",

They have a very extensive Gluten Sensitive Menu and EVERYTHING was delicious!! My husband and I felt so confident eating here because the entire staff was knowledgeable about cross contamination and gluten allergens. We met Jenn who is a fabulous bartender and very knowledgeable and she recommended some of her favorites to us. We will be making this a regular date night spot! It was OUTSTANDING!!",

We had the Lobster Shrimp Linguine, it was great, the flavor, pasta was al dente, the spice was not too creamy or overwhelming. We also had the Grilled Salmon, well prepared. I like the fact that you can order a full portion or half.  Hannah served us, she is amazing, her smile is infectious, she made us feel like we have been coming here for ages.

    "text": "Meh with a side of bad service. The menu isn't creative or special and it's overpriced for what it is. Expect to pay about $50 per person for dinner. At that price, you should get good service but you won't. We had reservations but had to wait 20 minutes for a table with no communication as to what was happening. We waited another 20 for drinks. Another 20 for salad. At the hour mark, about 35 seconds after getting our salad, the entrees came. They were not worth the wait. None of us were impressed and the server took forever to check in with us. Managers? Non-existent.  It's a real pity because my wife is gluten-free with lots of options but she wasn't impressed. I understand Charlotte doesn't have lots of options so I guess this is a place to go. But I doubt it's in your regular rotation given the other issues.  If the food were awesome, I could look past poor service but it's a menu you can find at so many other places that do it better or charge you less. It's just a meh place that really thinks it's cooler than it is. You can and should do better than eating at this souless corporate restaurant with a big interior design budget.",

The reviews, staff, and menu all bring a very confident approach to anyone with celiac or a gluten sensitivity/dietary choice. The hostesses and server (Justin) were extremely confident as well when we mentioned her condition, and were like \"yep thats what we specialize in\" thanks!!   We had the crab cakes entree & the crab crusted haddock. The meals were pretty big portions, hot, and very flavorful. The parmesan rosemary fries were awesome! Hot, crispy, & seasoned!!  She got the Chardonnay & the Cab Sav, and I got the Margarita Pura, then just a classic one. Very tasty, but not very strong. I liked the classic more, but everything was great! The atmosphere, the staff, and the food! We sat outside after sun down, and it was a very great dinner!   Thanks! Will return!",

Eventually the server came by and took it back to fix it. 15 mins later he comes by and says they are about to cook a replacement. At this point everyone else is done and looking for the check. I'm not going to make them all wait on me/the restaurant so I can eat.   Manager (I guess? Looked to be about 14 years old) comes by as checks are being dropped and says \"Heard we messed up your burger, can we make you one to go?\" Seriously?  That's what how the corporate manual instructs you to deal with the situation?  Place is so basic. Poor man's corporate Firebirds with a better location, worse food, higher prices and awful management.",

    "text": "Very trendy bar/restaurant.   Upon arrival the GM (Vincent) amazing and quickly escorted us to our table. We did make reservations and  glad we did as the restaurant was packed. Not so packed you were miserable or people were waiting allover the restaurant but full.   Our server was JJ who catered to every detail and really knew the menu and gave great suggestions. I hope when I go back we have her again as she really made the experience grand.   Let's get down to the yummy food we had. (We were a table of 4)  Appetizers:   Philly Spring Rolls-  Definitely is full of meat and cheese in a spring roll. The rolls are served with a spicy ketchup which is perfect for a philly roll. Out of 4 of us only 1 didn't care for it... definitely try!   Firecracker Shrimp : Definitely Asian fusion added to this dish. Shrimps were huge and cooked to perfection. You get 5 but again they are HUGE.   Main course:  Special- White fish (totally forgot the name) and a mushroom risotto - Absolutely amazing. The mushroom risotto was a major hit and all of our forks were diving in for a bite. Risotto cooked so perfect it melts in your mouth.   Paleo Burger with Brussels sprouts-  Large portion and equally satisfying if your watching that waist line. The only complaint was with the brussel sprouts. She assumed they would have been cut smaller but this is a preference thing versus an issue.   Short Ribs with mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts: This dish came as one of the recommended and patron favorite. Definitely tender meat and would order again. Not as good as that mushroom and fish dish though.   Crab Cake with french fires: Definitely full of actual lump cake versus fillers. The fries were garlic parmesan fries. My only complaint is the parmesan was at the bottom of the plate and not on the actual fries. Maybe I missed something there but none the less very good.   I added a side of she crab soup with my entree and again mind blown.   Rating: Best: White Fish and risotto 2nd: Crab Cakes 3rd: Short Ribs 4th Paleo Burger   Dessert:  We shared the cake/cheesecake samplers. They come in little mason jars packed with cake and icing. OMG..... heaven! Red Velvet ...enough said.  I have reservations coming up for restaurant week and can't wait to bring along several friends to try.   Way to go Burton's!",

I need to find one for the house! The mule was made very well and tasty! For my meal I ordered the short rib grilled cheese with a side of broccoli (needed some veggies). It was very good and I added the fresh pesto that came with the bread which added even more flavor.

    "text": "I love Burton's. I'm always searching for anything gluten free and it doesn't get much better than here. There's a dedicated gf menu. It's got a lot of choices too. The General Tso's Cauliflower is awesome and too much for one person. The calamari is great but I hate accidentally getting a hot pepper that's mixed in there. Be aware! When I want fried fish without making it myself, I come here. The fish sandwich with fried pickles is a dream come True if u can't eat wheat. We NEVER get fried food! I've eaten here several times at different times and lunch or dinner, fancy or casual, inside or out, I'm always happy here.",

They have plenty of parking in the shared lot. Upon entering I was greeted and seated. Staff placed orders on a hand held extrinsic device. They followed my recommendations. I noticed a trend. Their management and staff is has a standard. I quite enjoyed watching the management operate with gloves at the area where food went out and inspecting each plate. Not all restaurants follow such standards. My meal was great and I had he maple chicken sandwich with the superfood salad. I liked both. My friend and I shared the wings which were nice. I like the menu it has several offerings. The only note I have is that you have to clarify with the bar to not put a splash of sprite or soda in your beverage. Follow the ingredients on the menu and do not go astray. Most places have this problem which is why I sit at the bar if ordering drinks or have to state to the waiter specific requests of no soda as a topper. Once it's clearly stated the drinks were nice.",

I was greeted by the hostess and staff with smiles and friendly faces as soon as I walked in (they were admiring my shoes), more to the point, the impeccable service and friendly faces continued throughout my dining experience!!  The food was great!! The cauliflower was definitely a favorite!! The cocktails were a winner as well!! We enjoyed our dining experience and conversation with our waiter Red so much so that when we finally left, I was oblivious to leaving behind a very valuable item. You'd think the impeccable service stopped once we left. It didn't...I'm happy to say that Red went out of his way to ensure my item was returned to me. Thank goodness we made reservations and they had my contact info. Thanks again so much for awesome food and impeccable service!! Red, you rock!!!",

    "text": "I made a reservation on Yelp for a Saturday date night at Burtons.  I joined their rewards program earlier in July and received a $10 coupon, so that was another good reason to go to Burtons!  Our reservation was for 6:30, but we got there around 6:15 and we're seated immediately.    The ambiance is trendy and modern.  It's a really open environment and there is a nice patio if you want to sit outside.  Our waitress came over and we ordered two American mules.  They are made justttt the way I like them, not super sweet.    For an app we got the general tsos cauliflower appetizer and it was delicious.  It had the right amount of crisp and the sauce was delicious.  The app was brought out quickly and our waters never were empty.  We split the 14oz New York strip for dinner.  I ordered it medium rare and subbed out garlic truffle fries and mushroom risotto for the sides.  Our meal was split evenly for us, which was a nice touch.  The steak was seasoned perfectly but was over cooked, I didn't want to send it back because we were hungry .  It was more medium with barely any pink, but still tasted delicious.  The fries were amazing!    At the end of the meal there was an issue with my coupon and I had to give the waitress my phone, which was a little strange, but overall had a great experience.  4 stars instead of 5 because of the steak being medium and the coupon issue.  We will be back.",

It's confusing how you can botch such a simple menu and offer tasteless, bland food. Tuna was off, fillet had no flavor and looked boiled, mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts were really bad. The food at comparable places like 131 Main or Bricktops blow theirs away. Wish I could report differently but nothing redeeming about the food here.

She is both Celiac-intolerant and diabetic, so I was nervous about where we could go to share a meal. The interwebs recommended Burton's, and we were not disappointed. The MLT burger was filled with flavor, and the subtlety of the mushroom risotto was greatly appreciated. What really made the experience exceptional, however, was our server, Jacob. He was attentive to exactly the right degree, neither ignoring nor endlessly harrassing us. He allowed us to sit at the table all afternoon, continually bringing me hot water and lemon to nurse an oncoming cold. I do not know when I will be in Charlotte again, but if time allows I will most certainly be back. BTW--the cheesecake was amazing, too!",

I sat down at the bar and joined my friend who already arrived, there was a bartender putting an order into a computer he looked at me and went back to putting his order in no \"hello\" or \"I'll be right with you\". He looked at me again then walked away without saying anything. Another bartender walked by and again said nothing, kind of odd as I had nothing in front of me,not even a menu and was looking him in the eye. After about 5 minutes the original bartender came over and asked me if I wanted anything, I asked for a menu as it was my first visit and had no idea what cocktails were available he gave me the menu and walked away, still no real greeting.   We ended up splitting a couple of appetizers, we tried the calamari, philly rolls and the dry rubbed wings, all were great, especially the wings. I tried a few signature cocktails and enjoyed them as well, but the lack of welcoming service at a basically empty bar was disappointing.  It's so easy to make people feel welcome and it goes along way to making people want to come back in the future",

I loved our grilled avocado appetizer drizzled with an expert mojo and the sweet/salty cocktails we sampled, but my entree fell short. While I was impressed with the freshness of ingredients and the generous chunks of lobster and large shrimp the dish (lobster and shrimp pasta) was far too bland for me. I had to keep salting it throughout the meal and felt that it was missing something essential (spice, cheese...something?). I sampled my friend's hot wings and they were just so-so. Burtons is on the cusp of becoming a force to be reckoned with in the Charlotte restaurant scene but they need a little nudge in the right direction. I'd love to see the executive chef take an Eat, Pray, Love type tour and spend some serious time in Italy, India, and Bali to soak up those food cultures and become more comfortable with spices and oils. Less emphasis on fad diets (gluten-free, paleo, blah blah snore) and more emphasis on creating excellent flavor combinations please!",

For a Sunday evening, there was barely anybody at any tables, which we didn't mind because we were starving. After about 15-20 minutes, we placed our order with our server. Two of us got a side soup and 1 side salad to start before our entrees. The salad never came before the entree. Not a huge deal, as our entrees came shortly after that. However, one of the entrees (fish tacos) came over very cold. We notified our server, who took it back. Less than 5 minutes later, he brought them back only to find out they microwaved it, as opposed to bringing a new one out. Fish tacos are not a great item to eat microwaved, as they still tasted cold. On top of that, we found ourselves having to ask for drink refills and things like ketchup continuously. Overall, a very poor experience. For a table of four and no one left happy or content, was not the Sunday family dinner experience we were hoping for.",

Lots of conversation among the staff about who is working when, that party that came in earlier, was last weekend better than this weekend... Not awful but annoying. 14oz strip came out quickly with the waitress saying \"here you go and leaving\"... But it was at the correct doneness and temperature. Steak was good, brussels sprouts could have used more fat but the char was good, mashed potatoes were non-descript. Good liquor selection and friendly folks. I don't think the steak was worth $30 but it was good. Drinks could be cheaper, server said they had $5 drafts like it was a deal. I'd try it again if I were in the area.",

My friends and I came during restaurant week with no reservation on a Saturday evening during dinner time.... why not live in the edge?!  We were told there was about a 45 minute wait.  It was cold outside, so we waited.  Our wait was more like 15 minutes which was awesome and maybe because we hung out right by the host station and they were tired of looking at us .   The stuffed grilled zucchini was a tasty app we shared... they were made to order and a huge sharing portion for the three of us.  My friends had the risotto and the short ribs and were equally impressed!  I had the crab cakes with a superfood salad.  The salad was super tasty but served on a long rectangular plate that is a clumsy girl's like me worst nightmare but delicious all the same.  The crab cakes were tasty but I probably would not have chosen the mustard sauce it came with. The service was super attentive and very kind.

Waited another 3-4 minutes as he actually exited the bar area several times and returned to help other patrons.  As we were sitting at the entry gap on the bar, he should not have forgotten us - he walked past us at least 3 times.  Finally, the patrons to our right, noticing we were still sitting with no menu, offered us theirs.  We looked at the menus for about 5 minutes and the bartenders still didn't come come by to check on us.  At about the 15 minute mark, a couple of ladies came in and sat at the corner of the bar and the bartender went right over and offered them menus and asked what they'd like.  He seemed to know them.  At this point, we decided to cut our losses and leave.  As we were putting our coats on, the bartender came rushing over and said 'what / just drop in and leave?'.  I simply replied - 'the bad service so far doesn't not bode well for a meal.  We'll take our business elsewhere.'.  We left.",

The first time I was strict with my calories and there were so many creative salad options to choose from and salad I selected was fantastic similar to Cobb but wasn't on the fall menu.  This last time I wanted something warm and hearty and loved the chicken risotto.  My friends and coworkers all loved their entrees such as salmon with green beans, short rib grilled cheese,  which was fantastic.  The general tso cauliflower is so so so good!!!  The service is really great and staff really works together as a team and helps you make choices.  I can't wait to return",

Our waiter was very attentive and let us know about specials and how the kitchen is a made from scratch/custom kitchen so they can accommodate food allergies easily.  Everything is made to order.   I had the California club with sweet potato fries that were delicious. Since I had a gluten-free bun, the manager plated and delivered my meal, which I appreciated.   Yummy food, great service and a great ambience. Overall, really enjoyed my time at Burtons and hope to be back soon.",

The she-crab soup had a nice flavor but it was very runny (the consistency of a broth). And there was no crabmeat in the soup at all, just pure liquid. My husband got a NY strip which was over-cooked to medium + (he ordered medium rare). The steak also lacked seasoning, he actually had to salt and pepper it himself at the table. My burger was also over-cooked and lacked flavor. This is probably a positive for the food-sensitive crowd, but I didn't sense any salt/pepper in general as even the onion rings lacked the most basic seasoning. Our server Hannah was extremely attentive and friendly but could not make up for the over-priced experience. It has a cool bar and good drink menu.",

We were there for a large company Christmas party and despite our numbers (not to mention it was already a busy Friday night for them) they worked very hard to make sure we didn't wait for things, everyone had what they needed, dishes in the way were picked up quickly, and they were very professional and friendly about everything (although I'm sure they must have felt overwhelmed by us all!).

The service, food, everything was great and we felt so lucky to find this place. The reason for 3 stars is our second visit was anything but great. The service was really slow. The waiter was barely attentive as he had a big party to attend to. The food did not seem as good though I ordered the same thing as the last visit. I will blame this on the long waits. The topper was when we ordered dessert. We order this trio of 3 desserts each in a glass that you sorta dig out of. We order and then wait, and wait, and wait when finally he shows up. My coffee which I got quickly was cold just to let you know how long we waited. As we are looking at the 3 desserts we realize 2 of them are the same. We flag down the waiter and tell him there are 2 that are the same and he then explains that they ran out of one of the desserts. I said \"and so your solution was to give us 2 of the same and hope we didn't notice?\" He apologized and comped the dessert but that was really bad manners. One of the desserts was sorta like a pound cake that was to be soaked in milks...was supposed to be moist but we could not dig into it because it was so dry....we gave up on that. We were there just under 2 hours. The best part of the visit was seeing Bia again. We will request her next time....if theres a next time.",

    "text": "What a great restaurant. Let's start with our waiter Joshua. Loved his personality. Impeccable service. He told us about the Whim appetizers featured. We had the sweet potato gnocchi. It had a sauce we couldn't let go to waste so we got some bread to sop it up. Grilled bread, wow. Next to the salads, delicious, we tried the roasted beet salad and the Cobb minus the egg. Both very good and bigger than expected. Entrees were filet mignon with crab cake, mashed potatoes and broccoli. The broccoli was lightly seasoned with lemon butter. The other entree was a bronzed salmon paleo which melted in your mouth. We had to get dessert to go since we couldn't eat another bite, served in the cutest little mason jars. We also ordered a bottle of wine which is half off on Wednesdays and you can take the unfinished bottle home with you. A very good lunch of leftovers will be had the next day. Definitely a keeper of a place.",

Honestly the best service I've ever received in a restaurant ... and that's having been in the restaurant industry for 10+ years. On top of that we went there on Valentine's Day, which between that and Mother's Day is the busiest night of the year, and you usually expect the quality of service and food to drop a little due to the crowd... not in this case, we both had the catch of the day (mahi mahi) over a bed of mushroom risotto, the best piece of fish(and/or meal, the risotto  complimented the fish very well) I've ever had, and I lived on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico for 2 years... this topped them all... between the service, food, and atmosphere on a five star rating.... this place gets fifteen stars!!!!  PS..I had the minestrone as an app, it was also ridiculous... this place is killing it on all levels!!! Would strongly recommend to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

They are incredibly knowledgeable and only 3 things on their menu aren't GF. The risotto fritters, calamari and the burger were all superb. They use Udi's GF buns. I will say there are WAY better options out there for them to source their bread from. Whole Foods has an amazing GF bun and it's no additional charge. Maybe look into those buns :)",

The server was friendly, informative, and quick. He never seemed to be far when we needed another drink or napkin. The food itself (we got the zucchini app, crab cakes, and pork chop) was easily earning all five stars. Their version of an old fashion was good (I definitely ordered two) and a little gimmicky with the cocoa powder floating on top creating an undesirable film coating on the drink. Otherwise the whole experience was perfect. This was a great birthday dinner and we will be returning soon.",

I seemed like the kind of place you would go on a special occasion. Yes that is True but what I also found is that it is very relaxed. There were a number of families in all kinds of attire including shorts attending dinner. Don't let the air of fancy turn you away.   The food was very good and I appreciate that everything can be customized.  They asked us three times in there were any allergies, which we didn't have. They clearly take that seriously and that's great for people that have special diets.",

The staff is always attentive and always interacts with our baby. It's so nice to be welcomed with open arms, and not shunned for bringing her with us.  The food at Burton's is always delicious. They are so accommodating to my vegetarian diet. They go above and beyond to make sure I am well fed!  They changed their menu recently and took off the risotto I had loved. The server was very informative and helped me find a dish that was equally delicious and satisfying (the quinoa bowl).  We first came for the food, but come again and again for the staff! Bravo!",

Since we travel so much  l can't say we have many Great Restaurant experiences. Burton's really has their \"SHIT\"together. Unlike a majority of restaurants in CLT wear there's always a problem with your Dining experience. And I know you know what I mean if you live in CHARLOTTE. The first time I had lunch here was great.

We could see the Winter Olympics on the tvs above the bar area. Casey came over and introuduced herself as being our server for the evening. She showed us the Whim menu. I assume these items are special non menu items that frequently change. She gave us time to explore the menus before we ordered.  My bf decided on the porkchop and I chose the half portion of the lobster shrimp pasta.  He enjoyed his food. He recieved his knife late so he ate his sides 1st. My food was ok. I had to flag Casey down to ask for a spoon to assist in twirling my pasta. Yes im old school; my jr high teacher taught me that. My food didn't really have any seasoning. The portion was a nice size, but I had an overwhelming feeling of that I wanted to vomit afterwards. I don't know if I was full or I just felt ill from a wierd aftertaste.  Casey came by one time to check on us. She offered dessert and we declined. She spent more time telling us about the rewards card than anything else. You get $25 off after you spend $300. I'm not sure if I would come back for full dinner. This may be a good spot for drinks and apps at the bar.",

Would you like to start with an appetizer?  Gen Tso's Cauliflower?   YES PLEASE! I like this option better than the original Chinese chicken, as it's a light option that at least feels healthier, and probably is, although taste is my motivating factor in ordering these.  Lunch menu Flavorful, well-blended and balanced taste pallets on each plate.    My wife enjoyed the Knife and Fork burger with roasted mashed tomatoes and a dollop of Avacado and herbs over lettuce.  It comes with a side of cold sweet potato and celery salad, (not her favorite) she would opt for the broccoli option next time   My Short Rib Vermont grilled cheese and regular fries looked like I thought they would, but surprised with an impactful taste, not overpowered by any one ingredient.  The fries were also cooked crispy and not soggy, but had no long-lasting taste quality I would brag about.  That shouldn't be confused with a bad review, but everything else I sampled will be remembered.  We will make this a regular spot for lunch.",

Also love their rosemary parmesan fries! For all you fry lovers like me it is an absolute must to try!!! The drinks need also need a lil work. First time there - every craft cocktail I ordered was overly sweet for my taste - at some point I think I had to return a drink because it was too sweet. 2nd time there the drinks were just ehh ok.   The food itself i have mixed feelings about because the quality is there however the lack of seasoning isn't. My first go around I ordered the superfood salad with a crab cake on top - the crab cake was well seasoned but the salad itself was less than memorable. For my 2nd visit I did their feature of the night which was swordfish with risotto & I can't all remember what it entailed. The fish was cooked & seasoned perfectly, but the risotto was so bland that I had to salt it myself. Overall i would return again to dine here. I hope they can get the consistency down of seasoning their food!",

When we got there 20 minutes early, Mark (GM) was incredibly accommodating, found a place for us to perch and do apps and drinks and came back to ask us if we had enough space. Sabrina was our server. Things were so hectic but she really went above and beyond. The staff has always been great (we had a family celebration on an earlier day and they treated my parents incredibly well) but tonight they really went out of their way and I appreciate it.   As an aside, the food is always amazing and we have 2 vegetarians, one gluten free diabetic, and one guy who is just kind of picky, and the food is always exactly right. Sabrina was also extra awesome handling our dietary issues.   Point being that I should have reviewed them earlier, but eat at Burtons for family night or date night (or apparently restaurant week).",

I paid upwards of $17 for a short rib grilled cheese with fries, which, while tasty, was not particularly deserving of its price tag.  The service was poor, after waiting for 15 minutes in a visibly empty restaurant, someone finally noticed us. Although our server was friendly, my order was messed up, which was frustrating, especially with the price I paid. $17 will take you a lot farther at nearby Rocksalt or Viva Chicken, I have my doubts that Burtons can survive another year with its current quality in such a competitive market and expensive location.",

We have a couple of spots that stay in our rotation and now Burton's is one of them. The drinks are well worth what you pay for, not weak or watered down by any means and delicious! Drinks for The table, margarita w/OJ, the sangria drink and a sauvignon blanc. I'm totally getting that sangria next time. The food was hot, prompt and absolutely delicious. The Philly roll appetizer recipe has been perfected! I thoroughly enjoyed the lobster and shrimp pasta. It may not look like a lot in the bowl but I barely put a dent in it #delicious. My sis had the porkchop and she raved about it from first bite. Our dad had the 14oz Rib eye and his plate was completely CLEAN (how sway?). Great portion sizes, great food and great service!

Anyways, the cauliflower was sooo good. I had a salad that was on the weekly special menu and it was awesome. I think it was called the Harvest Salad which had lots of dried fruits. I loved it. I didn't get a chance to try any dessert. I'll be sure to come back.",

    "text": "First time trying Burton's. Tearing down the old building that housed so many resteraunt failures at this location was well needed. It was packed when we arrived but we had reservations. You have to somewhat akwardly walk by the massive bar area to get to the tables. First thing we noticed was how loud it was. They could use some noise dividers, but that may take something away from the open concept. I had the short rib grilled cheese at the recommendation of the server. It was absolutely delicious. I would definitely have it again. Prices are fair, maybe slightly overpriced but within reason. Service was prompt, no problems there.  The noise and the very large bar is a bit confusing. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be a fancier steakhouse type place or it's it's trying to be a bar with a kitchen. But overall I'd recommend giving it a try, it's one of the better resteraunts in Montford.",

Seated promptly and wait staff was right with us with menus and taking drink orders. Our party of 4 included a vegan and she was pleased with her choices. We were also impressed by half order options which many other restaurants don't offer. Wine, beer and cocktail selections were varied and numerous. I enjoyed a recommended red wine blend. Another in my party enjoyed a refreshing gimlet. All 4 of us had fish/seafood entrees but were very disappointed that at 6:30 the calamari was gone. My companions were very complimentary of their mahi mahi and haddock entrees. I had a shrimp and lobster pasta dish. It was okay but nowhere near the flavorful meal I had anticipated. We declined dessert but left sated and comfortably full. I thought the prices were a little high compared to other restaurants with similar menus. Salads, breads and other sides were a la carte. I may try the.lunch menu on a second visit.",

    "text": "This review is an update from my previous review, however before I write my updated review I want to give major kudos to the General Manager Marc Habbouche. Upon seeing that my first dining experience at the restaurant was not pleasant he reached out to me right away to resolve the matter. That says a lot about this establishment and shows me that not only does Burtons Grill & Bar value feedback from their customers but they take their reputation as a fine dining establishment seriously.. So now I'm going into my updated review. Upon me and my guest arriving to the restaurant the hostess greeted us with a smile and promptly seated us at a booth. Not long after our server Josh came out and went over the menu with us. The one thing that rocks about Burtons is that they have something on the menu to appease everyone and if you have a food allergy they will accommodate your specific dietary needs. As an appetizer I settled on the Fried Green Tomatoes that came with a side of homemade pimento cheese. The appetizer was freshly made and simply amazing not to mention that the pimento cheese is made fresh in the kitchen and has the right out of spicy kick to it that was perfect. I also ordered a drink called the Spicy Paloma and my guest had a Spiked Summer Slush both of our cocktails were awesome. As for my main entree I ordered the Thai Bowl and it rocked it was the perfect combination and sweet and spicy I eat vegetarian so I really love how their has a dedicated vegetarian section on the menu. Lastly to top it I had a dessert that knocked my socks of it was a combination of three delicious cakes/ pudding dessert, one was chocolate with by the way is Gluten Free another was a creamy cheese cake desert with blueberries and another was a caramel flavored dessert. Overall my dining experience was a complete 180 compared to the last time I dined with Burtons , not only was the ambiance and food top notch but the staff is very friendly and accommodating also the General Manager Marc Habbouche come out to greet me at my table personally he made me feel right at home, I was also greeted by the Assistant Manager Taylor and when you go to this place make sure to request Josh as your server he's awesome! Josh had a pleasant demeanor and really personalized my dining experience and checked back on me and my guest frequently and made sure that we were very well taken care of! If you are looking for great food with a beautiful ambiance with a personalized dining experience please be sure to check out Burtons! I'll surely be back! Thank you for making my dining experience a memorable one!!!",

We had Cauliflower appetizer and as awesome as the one in Boca.  My friends were impressed.  This time I had the Maple Chicken Sandwich and can highly recommend.  Not your typical chicken sandwich.  Only ate half and enjoyed the second half next day.  It actually tasted better! Cool atmosphere and will return.",

    "text": "Average. That's the best I can offer as far a defining our experience. At the price point and the quality the food is at, our party all had slightly higher expectations. Burtons fell flat for us.   Started with research on yelp, picking a new place to try for a family celebration. Went through yelp to make a reservation a week out, fast, easy, efficient. In the notes section of the reservation remarked that it was a family celebration.   Get to the restaurant, friendly greeting and seated immediately...however we were seated in a high traffic area that would've seemed more appropriate for a walk in rather than a reservation that noted it was a celebration.   Ok... quickly attended to by a friendly server. Next drink order. Husband ordered a beer, served the wrong one. And had to request a glass when he got the right one... looking around no one else was drinking from a bottle.   Family ordered, food was... well average. Served fairly quickly for a busy night but nothing exceptional to note. I ordered the mussels and had to request a bowl for the shells. Burger that was ordered was cooked to ordered doneness. Pasta and chicken orders both were - well fine, perfectly average.   Between the four of us, we ordered all over the menu. No one disliked, but no one raved. With so many other restaurants - several in walking distance - it's not that we won't be back, but I would be hard pressed to recommend, chose over one of the proven favorites or to give a another new place a first try - rather than go back.   Really had hoped to at least feel like \"great time\" when we left, but did not hit that mark for us.",

I highly recommend General TSO's cauliflower app, it comes with the perfect dipping sauce. You can't go wrong with the classic burger, which is by far the best in town - it's a REAL char-grilled, fresh angus beef patty that is not skimpy at all and comes with fresh cut fries. My wife enjoyed the crab-encrusted haddock over sauteed string beans - the fish was super fresh. This place sits high on our new go-to spots, and we are looking forward to going back soon.",

Was told the fish tacos were haddock, as the fish sandwich was. I've never had 'fishy' haddock, but it was quite fishy, and the tacos were average...and you only get 2...for $15. So for 2 tacos, a fish sammy (friend's - and she loved it), and 2 beers, the bill was $55 with a decent tip, for lunch.",

It was a hit - I have one co-worker who just went gluten-free and they are so sensitive to anyone with dietary needs or allergies. Don't think this results in a boring menu, however, the cauliflower appetizer has this crazy good Asian sauce and the calamari is different because they also fry up fresh peppers. The short rib sandwich (rib mean plus mac and cheese made into a heavenly grilled cheese) is my favorite but the bourbon shrimp and grits I had today were amazing. Nice patio which we didn't get to enjoy today since it was too hot, but great place to go after work when it cools down. Go to the gelato place that is in the Park Road Center parking lot for dessert and then go bowling at park lanes = perfect evening!",

There was definitely confusion with the host stand on who to seat next and the host sat a couple who just walked up before us.  The host then tried to recheck us back in and finally realized the mistake... several awkward moments later, we were finally sat.    The restaurant is beautifully decorated and well laid out. Our server was prompt and friendly.  She explained the restaurant, the menu, and offered us several menus if we had dietary restrictions.  I ordered the beef short ribs with bacon Brussels sprouts and a side of mushrooms & onions. It would've been nice if the correct order had come out the first time, but short ribs with risotto came out.  The staff promptly fixed the order as I munched on the fantastic, well seasoned bacon brussel sprouts.  The correct order finally came out and unfortunately it was terrible.  The short rib was overcooked, bland, and missing the red wine reduction.  It tasted like Sunday pot roast, yuck.  The server ended up grabbing the manager who was happy to listen to the feedback, offered me another dish, which I declined (wasn't hungry), and then brought over a huge piece of excellent key lime pie, which my son rejoiced over. The manager ended up comping the dish, which wasn't necessary, but I did appreciate it.    My husband's and son's dishes were excellent.  All in all, I'm adding this up to a new restaurant that just opened and they're still working out the kinks.  We will definitely go back and I hope to improve my rating of Burton's.",

Clever kitchen for sure.  Bar was prompt and concocted nice cocktails.  Wait staff was on point and they had to be as this was a busy place, even though it was a mid-week dinner.  Good wine list.  We had a Sycamore Merlot which was very good.  Appetizer was Cheese Steak Spring Rolls and their General Tso's Cauliflower.  Excellent, flavorful and satisfying.  Then I had the Short Rib Grilled Cheese which was so rich that I took half of it home.  Yummy, yummy.  Wife had the Roasted Beet Salad with chicken and she declared it very good.  We did not have time for dessert but they had them.  They have burgers and a good selection of entrees.  There were a number of seafood dishes, which I will try on another occasion.    There is a category they have called Paleo which is no sugar, no gluten and no dairy.  And this is in the deep south.  Also, there is a vegetarian selection of entrees.  Very modern and contemporary for Charlotte.  Service was excellent.  Prices were slightly high, but reasonable.  More than A-OK.  Versatile and special in many respects.

It's a beautifully decorated restaurant. Very clean and inviting.  We ordered the Calamari and Spring Roles. Yum. Yum. Yum. Those egg roles were recommended to me before I even got there. I love egg/spring roles so maybe I'm biased :)  I ordered the short Rib grilled cheese for my main. Seriously the best thing I have eaten in a LONG time. If you have not gone here I seriously suggest that you do. I can't wait to go on a date night so I can order it again!  See you soon!",

Whether you are vegetarian or gluten-free, they will always accommodate for dietary needs. Fantastic service and a great drink selection too. Nice, modern interior. This restaurant is perfect for a date night, business meeting or birthday dinner. A little on the pricier side but worth it if you are looking for a nice meal.",

I came here with a reservation for a group of 8 and the staff was very patient with us. They answered our questions without frustration and served the table gently and cleanly! It wasn't interruptive at all. The atmosphere is laid back and the wall decor is welcoming. Our group also appreciated that the kitchen tailors dishes accordingly for any diets and allergies. We weren't rushed out or rushed to put any order in or pay. It was a great night! A fly did fly into my friend's food dish where the manager came out to apologize and asked to make it up to her. All of their dishes are great also. General Tso's cauliflower, paleo seared salmon, quinoa bowl, fried calamari. Can't go wrong anywhere on their menu!",

    "text": "I've had the chance to dine and drink at Burton's a few times at this point, and I have to say - I like everything about Burton's, and would recommend this spot if you're looking for spectacular service and excellent food with a twist of couth.  Here's everything you need to know about Burton's from the Grill to the Bar...  Parking:  Parking shouldn't be much of an issue as Burton's is located in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center.  That's not to say you're guaranteed to find a spot in the front row - but still no worries with parking.  Ambiance:  The first adjective that comes to mind is \"class\", but not in an overdone, pretentious sort of way.  The nice square bar situated right in the middle, affords plenty of seating and perfect views of the HDTV screens.  Burton's is one of those multi-purpose spots that works well for any occasion - as you can definitely feel comfortable bringing family from out-of-town, a romantic date, or even professional associates for a post-work cocktail.  Service:  The service couldn't be better.  They get the little things right  - for example -  plates were cleared immediately after I finished, I received constant refills on water and drinks and servers are super friendly and personable.  I can't imagine anyone having anything less than stellar service from the second you walk in.  Food/Drink:  So far I've had the wings - half memphis dry rub and half maple sriracha sauce.  Both sauces were unique and I loved them equally. I've eaten both the Maple Chicken and Cali Chicken sandwiches.  On account of the fact that it comes with bacon AND cranberry (when's the last time you had cranberries on a sandwich?), I prefer the Maple Chicken.  The Cali Chicken sandwich, being slightly healthier, is almost a superb option.  Oh and can't forget the fries - of course the regular fries are great, but if you wanna go all avant-garde, you can run parmesan french fries or sweet potato frites!  Burton's has one of those menu's that has a dozen different items that all look and sound good.    What more can I say?? I've no complaints, I can't wait to go back and would def recommend (especially if you've never been before).  Burton's is an official member of my All-Goldilocks Team - a spot that seems to get everything Juuuuuuust-Right!!",

My first impression almost caused me to turn around...the \"little\" blonde hostess was unforgivingly rude!    Needless to say, I carried on to explore my anticipated dining experience. After being seated, I was pleasantly greeted and welcomed by Kyle our server.  Kyle was amazing!!   Long story short, I ordered the Burton's MaiTai (I eventually drank two) It was incredibly delicious!! We tried the General Tso's Cauliflower, lobster and shrimp pasta and their Maxx Burger.  First and foremost, the General Tso Cauliflower appetizer was everything!! The entrees and service was excellent!!  In spite of the unnerving hostess, we will surely return again.",

    "text": "So my friend and I desperately needed to get out of the house and grab a drink and Burton's was an excellent choice. It was equal distance between us and open on Easter Sunday evening.   When we arrived there were a few people eating outside and a few more inside. The atmosphere was very nice.   Our waiter Jacob was very nice and knowledgeable. I wasn't really hungry so I ordered the appetizer special Risotto Fritters and my friend got the California Chicken sandwich with a side of rice. My Risotto Fritters were delicious. The sauce was amazing. It was just enough. We both also ordered drinks. I got the Basil Lime Gimlet and she got the Allen Wrench.  Both drinks were good but we both preferred the Gimlet more.   I will def have to come back and try some of their other drink and menu options. I see a Cherry Cola Old Fashioned and the Maple Sriracha wings in my future!! It was very exciting to see they have paleo/ low carb options and even gluten free. When we arrived the hostess even offered us a gluten free menu. Jacob also let us know that if we had any food allergies they could basically cater to them because they make most of everything from scratch.

I don't write a lot of reviews, but when I have exceptional service, it's hard not to. Both my wife and I were servers in past, but I would've made a lot more money if I'd been as good at my job as Jatarius is at his. We never came close to needing anything; water was always full. He was energetic and informative. He also knew when to ask if we needed anything and when we just wanted to talk to each other. And while were enjoying our meal, he's bussing tables on other side of restaurant. I haven't seen work ethic like that since I was a kid. It was refreshing and my wife and I were happy to see it still exists out there. Marc (manager) did a great job finding him. Will be back soon.",

The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything you couldn't find better somewhere else. The drinks were pretty much the same. The service was good, the server was on top of everything for our party of six, but who cares if the food doesn't stand out in any way? If you're in search of an average contemporary dining experience with solid service then perhaps this is what you are looking for but I was just consistently let down by the mediocrity of everything I tried. I don't think anyone at our table finished anything completely except the buffalo dip appetizer. With Dilworth and South End right around the corner, you can find much better in the area.",

My husband has celiac disease, so finding a restaurant that is aware of gluten intolerance/celiac, cross contamination and the precautions needed is very challenging. But Burton's is a find! Almost the whole menu is gluten free! And the food is DELICIOUS! The servers are friendly and knowledgeable. We sat at the bar and Amy was our server. We also talked to Sabrina. They were able to discuss ingredients, what precautions are taken and told us about the training and allergen certification servers can receive. We will definitely be back!",

We first went to the bar while our table was gotten ready with a high chair for the joining members of our party. We had a drink with the bartender, Richard, who was fast and friendly.  Our server Angela was excellent and took her time to make sure everything was perfect. She never made us feel rushed even though we could tell the restaurant was filling up quickly.   Our food was egg rolls, Caesar salads, risotto provencal with bronzed shrimp added, a burger and a children's meal was all perfectly prepared by the kitchen. The hot food was hot and the cold food was cold and exactly as we ordered.   The manager, Marc, visited with us from the time we entered until we left. He was assertive and engaging without being overbearing or a nuisance. Observing him throughout the restaurant was impressive. He managed to be everywhere at once and never appeared to be in a rush.   Burton's decor and ambience is refreshing in the Charlotte food scene. TV's, art and classy design usually don't all come together so well.   This is an excellent addition to the Charlotte market and perfectly positioned in the Park Road area.",

I was bummed when I couldn't finish my meal (too much food!) but Danielle offered to box it up and keep it in the fridge until we could come back for it after seeing a movie.

I had never been to a Burtons before but was very happy to find them as I have quite a few dietary restrictions/allergies. The staff (waitress and manager) were very knowledgeable and did everything in their power to make sure I had the information I needed to eat a safe dinner. When there was a miscommunication with the kitchen, my meal was replaced and while I waited they gave my friend and I a very nice glass of wine. They also comp'd my dinner for the trouble. As anyone with many dietary challenges knows, eating out can be a big gamble. Not only was the food excellent, I didn't get sick and the customer service was fantastic. If I'm ever anywhere else where there is a Burtons I will be sure to eat there again.",

We typically have to ask 10 questions each time we go to a resturant on multiple plates to make sure she can eat without having a rash the next day.   We love the fact that they have gluten free menus that give more than two options. Half of the place we go only have a select few items and it was nice that she actually got to choose a meal instead of choosing between two similiar options.   We did throw them for a loop with asking for no nightshades but luckily that was a simple removal of tomato from her meal.   If you have allergies, Burton's try their best to be inclusive to help you. It's a must stop for a nice dining experience for anyone.",

Must be done on a grill with a heavy weight. Likely not something to recreate at home. Can't wait to have this again on a return visit.   Started the meal sharing a fried cauliflower appetizer.  Also very tasty. The other entree was a half-order of a Mediterranean risotto. Well prepared and good, but not to the level of the short rib.   Service was very welcoming. We were fortunate to have been served by Amy, a very gracious and helpful server. Hope to see her again.   Prices are not inexpensive but I felt that the value was there, given the high quality. Highly recommend!",

I had an amazing evening with my friends and the food was okay (I am very use to foreign food with a lot of flavor) which is why I think I was a little underwhelmed with what I had. Burtons Grill & Bar also is not a place you can go to every night or often as the price point is pretty high in my opinion. I would certainly go again for appetizers, drinks and to socialize with friends!",

I tend to always try the Reuben when I see it on a menu. This one didn't disappoint. It was on marble rye and the meat was thinly sliced and easy to bite into. Good ratio of dressing and sauerkraut too. Also not super greasy.  I swear it only took five minutes to receive our order. It was insanely quick. Burton's does have a gluten free menu as well.",

We started with an app of General Tso's cauliflower. I thought it would be like the indo-chinese dish Gobhi Manchurian and it was, but the crispy fried skin didn't really take. As soon as you cut into the cauliflower, it sort of just fell off. It was a good general Tso's taste, but could have been done better. The best part may have been the remoulade on the side.  For my main, I had the dinner portion of crab cakes (all entrees can be ordered as a lunch or dinner portion.) The crab cakes were entirely fine but unremarkable. My favorite bit was likely the veggie slaw. The worst part, by far, was the frites. They looked like decent fancy frites, but they were tasteless and texturally off. I only ate a handful.",

We were lucky enough to find a corner at the bar and enjoyed a couple cocktails before we were seated. The girls enjoyed a couple Blueberry Squeeze cocktails while I enjoyed a Tito's & Tonic with a lime slice.   Salads were nice portions- Romaine, iceberg, cucumbers, grape tomatoes, peppers, blue cheese, applewood smoked bacon, mustard vinaigrette.  I ordered the half portion of lobster shrimp pasta (pictured)- fresh tomatoes, snap peas, parmesan, fettuccine, and a tomato cream sauce. Lesley had a filet mignon- steakhouse butter, dry rub, mashed potatoes, & broccoli (pictured). Both of these selections were amazing dishes! Our friends had the Salmon Romesco- bronzed Gulf of Maine salmon, Romesco sauce, herbed jasmine rice, julienne vegetables, citrus fennel slaw (also pictured) and another filet.   Place is awesome all the way around- food, atmosphere, and service. All four of us agree, 5-stars!",

    "text": "So I found this lovely spot on yelp. Yelp is always my go to for visiting new establishments. I was intrigued by there menu and all the great reviews for their lobster and shrimp pasta.   The atmosphere was nice and eclectic with a casual feel. The hostess and waiters were very prompt and visual. My husband and I were greeted and seated the second we entered. We ordered the shrimp and lobster pasta, the crab stuffed haddock and key lime pie for dessert to help celebrate my birthday. The only disappointment was not ordering enough food haha. The pasta was amazingggggg. I mean the large chunks of lobster and large shrimp were perfection. The haddock was so tender topped with the stuffed crabbed accompanied with lemon rice and asparagus. Nothing was over or undercooked and seasoned just right. Now for the finale, the key lime pie! It had a fresh graham cracker base and not an overly tart filling. It was almost like I had my own personal pie!!!   If you are in the mood for a nice versatile menu with great affordable meals and overly tasteful cuisine, come visit Burtons Grill in the park rd plaza. Tell them I sent you :).",

The table I received was slightly awkward cause it was on the end of an aisle but managed to be out the way. I was greeted immediately by the server and she rang my order in on the mobile device which was super efficient. The menu is small but diligent and covers everything. My food came out before my drink. Assuming it's cause it was literally a snack. Ordered a Mai Tai and it came with a frozen pineapple ice cube (fancy.)   I enjoyed my food. It was steady and the food, service and drinks were still timely. Can't wait to go back and try more off the menu.",

My favorite is that I can easily make reservations from the Yelp app.  The food is delicious and they will cater to any dietary restrictions you may have.   Gluten Free? They have an entire menu with just gluten free options. They also serve their gluten free meals on different shaped plates, so they are easy to identity.   Paleo? Yep, they have a dedicated section for that too.   Doing a whole 30? You can definitely eat here and feel good about it as well.   Vegetarian? They got your back here too! Or just a foodie in general - you just cannot go wrong with the place.   Hands down my favorite here is the Fried Calamari with Peppers off their Gluten Free Menu. These little bad boys are hot, fresh, crispy, and super tender. Not one piece of over cooked calamari. Honestly, on our last visit - it was so good, we ordered another plate. It was a hit - even with our 7 year old.   While speaking of my child, let's talk about the kid menu here. It's not just some crappy kids meal with burger and fries or tenders and fries. Your kids get to eat like a real person with real food options here. They get to choose from a variety of options and I am simply in love with that concept.   Crab cakes are insanely delicious - filled with lots of crab and no filler. The steaks are a great cut of meat, salmon is super fresh. The pork chop dinner here is also a winner. I just cannot tell you that I have ate here and had a bad meal. Everything here is delicious.   Burton's may be a chain but they support local farms as much possible.",

I started off with the Mai Tai, which was crafty and tasty......mental note to return for drinks.  The General Tso's Cauliflower with chili sauce was so good, it was a favorite with the group as well.  We also had the signature wing's and philly spring roll's, again very good.  For my entree I ordered the short rib grilled cheese with sweet potato fries, my son had the lobster shrimp pasta, and my husband had the shrimp.....everything was good, no complaints.  Other favorites for the group was the pomegranate martini, and the cosmo.  The drinks alone are worth another visit.",

If you or someone you care about has any kind of special diet or food allergy, you've got to make a trip to Burtons. On each visit, our server has greeted our table by introducing themselves and then asking if anyone has a food allergy. It's clearly at top of mind here. I've happened to notice after a few visits that gluten free entrees come out on a different plate than other meals, too, so it's clear to the kitchen and the wait staff that the dish must be handled with care.   My absolute favorite thing on the menu is the fish sandwich. I've ordered it several times and can't get enough. It's crispy and slightly spicy and makes for a perfect meal. I've also quite enjoyed the crab cakes.   This is a perfect spot -- there's something for everyone on the menu and the ambiance is killer. It's not an inexpensive meal, but it's reasonable given the quality and the service.",

    "text": "Both the hostess and server professed this to be a scratch made kitchen.  My interpretation of scratch made means, we do way more in house than your average bar and grill.  So it's a completely realistic expectation that you bake your own breads and deconstruct the meat from whole pieces. Otherwise you're really like most other bar and grills.  So being seated next to the kitchen, I wasn't happy seeing bread come from a bag and just the breast of the chicken for a roasted chicken plate.  Where's the rest of the chicken??  The decor and ambiance suggested this was certainly a bar and grill.  While it is nice on the inside, there are elements that don't fit the upscale theme.  Track lighting is low cost and effective for fast casual, but shouldn't be used for a full service that wants to price themselves on the upper end.  The menu layout felt like a cross between a steakhouse and a typical bar and grill.  The price point on the menu is what diners typically associate with  Finer Dining.  Each item is about 30% more than say a Hickory Tavern or comparable upscale Bar and Grill.  My expectation of the food was high once I was told this was a scratch kitchen and once I saw the pricing.  The food, while not bad at all, was really a let down from from expectations.  Service was very friendly, but just not formal enough to justify pricing.  Food was pretty good. -Crab Cakes were jumbo lump, but not big pieces like you would see in MD -Roasted Chicken was just a breast on a bed quinoa.  While the poultry was tender, it was just one average size breast.  -Pork Chop is sourced from a good NC farm.  I've eaten this exact chop at another Charlotte restaurant.  My previous experience gave me a point of comparison, and Burton's was not as good.  Cooking chops is an art, they're often tough and easy to dry out.  Burton's came topped with mounds of red peppers and Parmesan in an attempt to mask the very average cook job of the pork chop  -Wings were tasty and well cooked, but we expected more than 8 wings for $14  Final take.  Nice place with good food, but charging 30% more than equivalent food at other places.  The kitchen looked to be staffed with cooks, not chefs.  I love the idea of a place that offers really high quality food in an upscale casual environment.  The problem is that Burton's  food does not live up to the billing",

I like to get out of the house but mainly love eating and trying new things. My Daughter has Celiac Disease and it's hard to go out because most restaurants and servers don't understand about cross contamination so we wind up eating at home lately because we can control what we do in our own kitchen. Burtons was an absolute delight!  We were immediately welcomed with a gluten free menu and an explanation about how they are very sensitive to a gluten free diet.  Separate fryers, safe handling procedures and pretty much everything on their menu can be prepared gluten free.  We started with the General Tso's cauliflower...simply put, AMAZING!  Not too spicy and the cauliflower had a nice texture and was very flavorful.  My daughter had the lobster & shrimp pasta which she thoroughly enjoyed since she rarely gets to eat pasta.  Sweetie had the salmon romesco which she also liked.  Me?  I'm not celiac and ordered the Beef Short Ribs.  Very tender and flavorful.  Simple and delicious.  It had a MESS of mashed potatoes and broccoli.   We finished off with the \"trio\" dessert which had a cheesecake, brownie and butterscotch in mason jars.  Excellent! I must mention the service also.  I was impressed with Red, our server.  He was very knowledgeable about the menu and how Burton's takes care of those with food allergies.  You can tell he was trained well and represented the place well. Burton's is a welcome addition to our dining rotation.  We will most certainly be back!",

For my meal I got the Mediterranean salad and vegetable bolognese- both were delicious and the small portions are the perfect size to save room for dessert. My wife got the fish tacos which she found to be lackluster, she even tried adding salt and a siracha sauce but found them to be bland- hence the 4 stars. The service was quick but our server didn't check to make sure the siracha had improved my wife's meal, I honestly think we would have sent it back and tried something else but I was basically done with my meal by the time he came and physically checked in (I saw him peer over a couple times but it was too quick to really grab his attention). We decided to try the creme brulee and it was excellent. Overall it was a good experience for me- so/so for my wife but I think we will have to come back and give them another shot in the future!",

I had the braised short rib which was very tender. My date had the lobster and shrimp pasta dish that contained tons of meat! Both were very good choices. I will definitely return to this modern spot. Ask for Cory :) great service!",

I had the 14oz ribeye steak with shrimp and blue cheese sauce and sauteed spinach with the twice baked potato. Everything was seasoned to perfection and was delicious. The portion sizes were very large and filling. My guest had the crab encrusted haddock which was very flavorful. The drinks from the bar were excellent as well. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good evening to chill and drink or as a good date spot.",

As I continued journeying around Charlotte to try all of the reubens, I stopped by a place I had been looking forward to trying as Burton's is the most upscale restaurant with a reuben on the menu. The sandwich was described as a delicious reuben, and it did not disappoint. From a flavor standpoint, Burton's reuben was one of the best of the approximately 30 I've tried around the Queen City. The corned beef was very unique - full of flavor and almost melted in your mouth. Very different than the corned beef I had become accustomed to in a very positive way. It set the sandwich apart as the rest of the sandwich was pretty average (but corned beef is the most important part to a reuben so that's OK!). The bread was well crisped but just standard rye, the cheese was good but not very plentiful, and the proportions (aside from the cheese) were spot on. The one miss was the kraut - it was clearly added to the griddle along with the corned beef. This dries the kraut and leads to an unpleasant stringy texture, and if this hadn't been the case the reuben would have been one of the best 3 in Charlotte.",

And then, i thought things couldn't get better - I get my chicken wings. The rub on them was THE BEST I've ever had. I'm from Memphis and this run had a very strong resemblance to our world famous Rendezvous dry rub. The wings were SO perfectly crispy on the outside and so perfectly cooked, I had almost wished I didn't eat the zucchini rolls so I could eat more wings. Hands down one of the best quick meals I've ever had. And this is my second restaurant review EVER. Seriously delicious food and the atmosphere is a great blend of being  upscale yet laid back.

The only issue I had was that we were asked right off if we have dietary restrictions/allergies and I let the server know I was vegan. She nodded her understanding and got our drink orders. From my previous visit I knew which vegetarian items could be made vegan and had my order ready to go. I got the vegetarian risotto and asked for her to have it made \"vegan style\" (no cheese, no butter sauce). My food then came out with cheese and butter. Luckily I saw the cheese prior to taking a bite as I do have a dairy allergy. The waitress seemed completely surprised that I didn't want dairy. For a place that asks about diet up front I expected better. It should be noted that my lunch experience was with a very educated waiter who knew exactly how to prepare (or ring in) my food - hence the 4 stars. The manager brought my new dish - no apology, no discount.",

The portions were more than ample and a good bargain IMO.  Moreover, they were prepared properly and tasted well.  All are do-overs.  The star of the day,  surprisingly, was the General Tsao Fried Cauliflower appetizer.  If my Mom cooked veggies like this when I was a kid, I would've gobbled our garden to the ground.  So. Very. Good.  Servers were excellent.  Thank you Hannah and your trainee Michelle.  Good job!  A couple issues beyond their control kept the score at 3.5 - 4 stars.  My very dry martini came out verrry dirty and had to be remade.  Lori's entree was put in wrong and she received a crab cake and not the crab crusted haddock dinner.  They corrected the error and lowered the tab somewhat.  Overall, a good start to a place I can walk easily to from my home.",

My date and I were headed to another restaurant on Park Road, the old faithful Italian spot- until I remembered I wanted to try Burton's. It was late Sunday evening, and there was a healthy amount of patrons having dinner and drinks. The exposed kitchen area was a nice decor choice, as was everything else.  Our server, Josie, was phenomenal and friendly. She answered any questions we had about the menu and helped me pick my appetizer selection for the evening.  We had the she crab soup, firecracker shrimp, crab stuffed haddock and the lobster shrimp pasta. I enjoyed every plate and my favorite was the pasta with a large amount of lobster pieces. I also ordered a Tangerine martini that was poured table side for me. Delicious!  It took a short while to decide what entrees to enjoy this time and which to save for the future. I can see why a few other people have eaten here repeatedly even though they've only been open for a few weeks- it's very, very good.",

They get very excited that they can order off the entire menu, instead of being limited to the one gluten-free item on the menu like at most restaurants.  The gluten-free fries are awesome!  What I don't love about Burton's: the menu rarely changes and even when it does, it's just a few items typically on the specials that change.  It can get old eating the same few items every time.  Some of the dishes (especially the risotto and pasta dishes) are pretty bland.",

Need sauce on the side? No problem. I come from a family of picky eaters, so this flexibility is truly appreciated. We hate being difficult!   My boyfriend and I split the stuffed zucchini appetizer. Italian food lovers will adore this dish! It reminded me of the lasagna/manicotti from Living Kitchen (the same pillowy texture inside with an al dente vegetable \"noodle\"), only this version is made with dairy cheese.   For our main dinner, we ordered the knife & fork burger (him) and the shrimp romesco (subbed in for salmon as the paleo option). Both were delicious! Generous portions, warm and welcoming service, and a chic atmosphere? We found our new standby. Hopefully you will too!",

Crab cakes and Pork chop for entrees. Pork chop is ok. It didn't have too much flavor but the Brussel Sprouts and mashed potatoes were amazing. The crab cakes were very good. Bricktop's are better in my opinion but these were definitely holding their own. Little to no filler, all fresh crab. Sides were great.   Service: The style of service is great but my server was off her game. She talked too much about things that I didn't need to hear, and her menu knowledge was non existent. Watching other servers though, I could see that was not the norm. Management was attentive and made up for an awkward server. We will definitely be back, but we are not in a hurry.",

The service was impeccable and they made it clear that they could accommodate based on any allergies or special dietary needs. My only recommendation to this restaurant would be to add sweet and low to the selection of sweetners. It is my sweetener of choice and they only had Truvia, Splenda and regular sugar. I need my PINK PACKETS! Overall, this is a first class restaurant. Already I can't wait to return. The food, service, and atmosphere are all things to write home about!",

You can choose your portion small or large and the haddock was incredible! I had the small but it's generous. I enjoyed looking at the other offerings & I cannot wait to try on my next trip. You know it's great food when you're already scoping out the next meal. Next time I will try the short ribs.  We walked in without reservations and they ended up being able to seat us quickly. They were very busy but cheerful. I tried the cocktail the classic mojito. It had lovely mint flavor and a bit light on the alcohol. Their beer and wine list was ample and they had NC local beers too (though they ran out of one of my faves). The service was helpful and polite and they made good suggestions. The atmospheric decorations and the bar with tvs had a comfortable vibe and laid back feel. You can dress casually and dine well!",

Ribeye should be well marbled and tender, but mine was about 40% fat, meaning that about six large  pieces were just fat, no meat at all. My annoyance is that the cook should have seen that and rejected the steak, it should never made it to the table (it was very obvious). I would also say the prices are a bit high for the quality, compared to nearby restaurants of similar ilk. I am not saying don't visit, but just pointing out a quality control error that should not have happened.",

    "text": "Rating at a 3 because my experience was \"A-Ok\". The moral of the story is to listen to your waitress when she makes recommendations. I took a friend out to eat for her birthday and we enjoyed ourself. After being seated, a lady told us that she was just taking our drink order, but ended up serving the entire time without clarification. No big deal. She recommended the buffalo chicken dip for an appetizer. It was great, but not a hefty portion, as the dish in which it was served was shallow. I make the same at home, just as good.   She also recommended the pork chop. My friend let me taste, and it was great. Funny how other people's food always taste better than your own. That's just life. Rather than going with her recommendation, I looked at pictures on Yelp and did my own thing, having the crab crusted haddock. I was unimpressed. My first bite was dry and bland. The internal portion wasn't dry however. I asked for some lemon butter to add a little pizzazz, which made it edible. Nevertheless, if you are on the fence, choose something else, as it lacked flavor. The crab wasn't crabby. The rice and vegetables were fine. And it's not that the haddock was bad, it just wasn't good - flavorless. Salt/ pepper/ lemon juice/ Old Bay....something would've worked wonders.I managed to eat it all.   Lastly, the large portion was very large. If Really hungry, get it. Otherwise, get the smaller portion.",

We were lucky to get one of the last tables outside. Having never been we decided to order a variety of small plates to share, great idea.  The General Tso's Cauliflower was amazing! It is crispy yet soft with an amazing Glaze. The grilled Cheese did not disappoint either. Filled, and I mean filled with pork and melted cheese. It was cooked to perfection and the fries that accompanied the sandwich were great! Finally spring rolls, again filled with meat. They definitely do not skimp on the portions so I definitely recommend ordering a few things to share. We topped the night off with the dessert trio.   Overall, Burton's is a great addition to Park Road Shopping Center. I definitely cannot wait to get back.",

Did I mention the food? Top notch from sandwiches on up to more extravagant fare, They have their own discount club too, which I am happy to say I am a member.

I would describe it as a more casual/modern Steak House that serves a lot of seafood.  They have a huge bar with a number of TV's if you want to go for a sporting event or if you just want to go solo for some good food.  I love the wine menu.  It's not overly extensive, but there are several great bottles to choose from that are very reasonably priced. I had the Red Snapper served over risotto.  They cook the fish however you like; which is nice-- and it tasted fresh and was well prepared.  My fiancee had the scallops which were good quality, fresh, tender, and cooked correctly.  They are very accommodating at Burton's.  It's especially a good choice for seafood, steak, and wine lovers.",

I've been here a couple times for dinner and lunch. Each time the food was good. Once, we ordered a shrimp appetizer and it came out raw. They quickly fixed it without any hassle. I also tried the Reuben sandwich for lunch. It was very comfort-food for me. They offer a nice alternative menu for those of you on the Paleo plan.   For what you get, it comes at a steep price in my opinion. I can't regularly plop down $50+ on lunch for a standard sandwich.   The servers and management are nice and welcoming. They have a great patio and will be ideal for perfect weather days before going to see a movie.",

I'm very happy that this bar/restaurant is in the Park Road Shopping Center area.  I think a bar with great TV's for sports but with excellent food has been needed in this area for quite some time.    The food is excellent.  We've tried several things on the menu and have never been disappointed in the flavors or presentation or consistency.  Compliments to the Chef and his kitchen staff.  The decor features interesting bits of framed art.  No particular style, but eye-catching fun.  Large windows at the entrance/bar really open the place up.  The patio is separate from the bar area and is covered so that is a plus.  My only slight is from the perspective of bar service.  The bartenders are very friendly and nice when you talk to them, but it can be a chore to get their attention.  No-one seems to make eye-contact or stay engaged with customers wanting refresh's on their drinks.  I'm not sure if this is from a bar design perspective or uncaring floor managers, but it can be a bit frustrating watching them chatting with each other while you're trying to get their attention.  That being said...  it's a great place for catching up with friends, watching sports and getting great food.",

I am taking away 1 star because we both ordered Moscow mules upon seeing other tables with cool copper mugs. When our waitress brought ours they were in what looked like a 12 oz water glass, explaining they were out of mugs. A few minutes later she circled back with mugs, which was thoughtful, but when we poured them in after only 2 sips the drink barely reached the halfway ppoint. Other mules at tables around us were full so it just felt like we got less value comparatively.   The other star I'm discounting for food. I got the pork chops after reading yelp reviews however I thought they were lackluster and bland. Nothing I'd order again. My boyfriend got the fish tacos and French fries and both were also just meh. The fries had no seasoning and tasted like they'd been out for hours.   Our waitress was kind and attentive and did the best she could. Also I like that they take reservations. So overall I'd give it a try if you want a guaranteed Friday dinner reservation but proceed with caution on what you order. It's not a cheap spot where you can brush off being unhappy with the food.",

    "text": "This restaurant is quite a gem. There were six of us in the party, one of whom has multiple allergies. As noted in other reviews, the restaurant caters to people with specific dietary needs whether vegan, gluten intolerant or peanut allergies. Very interesting how it is all spelled out in the menu.  That said, they deliver on multiple points. The wine list, the appetizers as well as sandwiches and main dishes were all prepared very well to specific requests. As in the burger was medium to well done, the steak was medium rare and gluten free food was prepared as promised. The General Tso cauliflower was perfectly prepared and I had the chicken risotto which was outstanding. The restaurant was very clean as was the restroom. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area",

My wife has a ton of allergies which makes going out to eat difficult at times. Once we sat down at the table and were greeted by our waiter, The first question out of his mouth was \"Does anybody have any food allergies we need to be aware of?\" He went on to tell us that the restaurant owners take food allergies/sensitivities very seriously as they have a family member with food allergies. They know what it's like to have to deal with these issues. They even have a completely separate area where gluten free foods are prepared so that there is no risk of cross-contamination. Our waiter then proceeded to write down the long list of allergies and then told us no problem. He said they make everything to order and they can accommodate pretty much anybody. We were blown away by this. This was the first restaurant that my wife and I have been to that really seems to care about what they do and they take their job very seriously. The fact that the food was incredible is just icing on the cake. Most restaurants could care less if you have food allergies or not. They are careless and don't take you seriously and think that you're just on some type of crazed food fad for the moment. But when you suffer from multiple serious food allergies, it can be downright dangerous at times. Burtons Grill and bar have set a new standard in my book and they do an amazing job. This is now The new \"go to\" restaurant for me and my wife. The service is next to none. I highly recommend it!",

The servers were great, they were helping each other and working together to get food out very quickly. The bar was moving a little slow, probably due to volume, or not enough bar tenders, but the drinks were done well. Love the atmosphere, very cozy. The products are a bit pricey, but for the quality of service, cleanliness, and food you recieve, its worth it!",

Made wonderful suggestions. If you want someone to cater to you, she's your gal. Let's start off with the Philly spring rolls. They had a ton of flavor and couldn't be more perfect for a small bite before your food arrives. I ordered from the whim menu. The \"General Tso's Fried Cauliflower\" and honestly, I could eat it like popcorn. My friends loved everything and to be quite honest, our server really knew the menu and couldn't be more chipper. Thanks Burtons! Can't wait to come back!",

Hannah was our server and she went above and beyond to make our experience wonderful (grabbed trash such as straw wrappers off of our table, traded in our app silverware for new silverware for our meal, made sure our drinks were always full, checked on us as soon as our food was delivered, and had our checks ready and split when we were ready to roll). She was very knowledgeable on the menu and the specials, offering several recommendations. We decided to go with Hannah's suggestions for apps: General Tso's Cauliflower and the  signature wings. I didn't dive into the cauliflower but it looked incredible. The wings were delicious - both the dry rub and maple sriracha sauce were packed with flavor without too much heat. For our main course My husband had the short rib grilled cheese (he said his was amazing), and I had the black bean burger (mine was okay). The 5 stars is mainly for receiving such great service here. There are a lot of great places to eat in Charlotte, but sometimes top notch service is hard to come by. We'll be back!",

Danielle was amazing she described everything and handled us with 5 star service which is saying a lot for me. It's so hard to find restaurants that both my boyfriend and I like due to my allergy and him loving fried chicken and burgers and fries. He got his burger and lived it! My plate came separate and was prepared on special grills with care!!!! The manager and Danielle also recommended the dessert Trio. I was nervous because it was chocolate cake and cheese cake etc. ALL GLUTEN FREE and amazing. I can't express enough how great this place was. Even Management made sure that everything was taken care of!!! Def coming back asap.",
