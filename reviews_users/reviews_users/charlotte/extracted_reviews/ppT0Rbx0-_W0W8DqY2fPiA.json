The cheeses / sauce ratio was just right and the toppings were seasoned well and was plentiful.  The slices are pretty big.  I would say 1 - 2 slices should be plenty of most people.",

I love the fact that it's usually pretty crispy enough to wear it doesn't go limp when you pick it up (get your mind out of the gutter). The pies aren't really worth it, they end up being pretty expensive when you add on toppings of your choice. I'm just glad they got rid of their previous female employee that worked the counter..she was obnoxious and so rude. The people working there are almost all hispanic but who cares, the slices are good!",

    "text": "Luigi's sells authentic NY style pizza.  I grew up in NY and spent years looking for good pizza in Charlotte, I finally found it when I went to Lugi's.  The crust has the right combination of crunchyness and chewyness that makes or breaks NY pizza.  The sauce has the right flavor and is always applied in the right quantity.  The cheese is the right style, and is not too greasy (NY pizza should have some greese).  The subs are also excellent.  The veal parm is real veal cutlets, not the pressed hockey pucks served by some other local shops.  The chicken parm is fresh breaded.  The sausage and peppers is excellent.  I have never had a bad experience at Lugi's, it is the best pizza shop in Charlotte.",

The last time I had such good pizza was in San Diego at Ocean Beach where all the poor college students congregated for 99 cent slices.  The jumbo single cheese slices were out of this world... dripping with sauce and goodness... i love the crust too.  And this place remakes those memories with wonderful, tasty, delicious pizza slices.  The crust is simply to live for!  Chicago has great pizza too but for me nothing beats this pizza in CLT!",

This time no raw uncooked bell peppers. That was one more good stromboli! The crust was cooked to perfection!

Why it's a damn good parm sub:   1) It has the perfect amount of sauce:  it's flavorful and plentiful but doesn't turn the bread into a soggy sad mess. 2) Speaking of bread, it's toasted perfectly: The  corners of your mouth do not feel like they had a date with a hack saw. 3) Hey there's chicken in there- and guess what it tastes like chicken: No rib meat or bright pink mash-up they serve at other places.  4) The cheese oozes - you guessed it, perfectly. No oil slick flavor in the mouth but enough ooey gooey goodness to set your gym bells ringing.   As soon as I can pull myself away from the deliciousness that is that sub I will surely try their pizza.",

I cut it open, which was difficult because it was mostly burnt, with a plastic knife and fork,  and there was the largest amount of cheese I have ever seen. There were about 4 slices of the cheapest ham lunch meat sliced up inside. The lunch meat was slimed and rubbery, all at the same time. The sauce tasted nice, but it was so thin you could drink it easier than dip it. I hate to mention the doughy garlic knots, because I wanted to like something, but I had to think \"mind over matter\" to continue to swallow them. The drink machine needed syrup, and the tea tasted like nothing at all. The radio playing above our heads was just super loud static. And finally, it cost $30 for 2 people, that makes it so much more disappointing. I am new to Charlotte and have been looking for a nice pizza place, guess I'll keep looking !",

    "text": "Okay... I'ma tell you why it's three stars, considering the pizza was actually pretty good...   I went in a little while ago to pick up a quick slice because I've been running around today and didn't have time to eat...  I noticed all these awesome reviews and figured I'd give it a try... As soon as I walked in, I was greeted warmly and assisted... I ordered a slice of pepperoni to go since it was close to closing...  I was super excited when the guy pulled my pizza out of the oven... It was a huge slice and it looked great!  But here's my question:  What happens when you get actual NY pizza to go? Do they just take the paper plate it's on, fold it in half and shove it directly into a paper bag with no cover, container or anything?  Not trying to be funny, that's an actual question... Because if the answer to that is yes, then they are truly authentic...  Otherwise, what in the world is that about? lol  Look, I promise I am not a cray cray germaphobe or anything (regardless of what the boyfriend says), but look here... The dude shoving my pizza in the paper bag?  He used his BARE HAND to fold the tip of my pizza and my crust in place to fit inside said paper bag... Oh, sweetness... Nooooooooo... I'm sure he's an awesome guy... He was really nice to me and all...  But if you're working the front line that close to closing, you are very likely touching waaaaay more than just food and now you're going to stick your hand on the top and bottom of my food?  Ick.  Seriously...   After I took the tip of my pizza off, the rest of the slice was awesome... Truly... I definitely am a fan and I'll be back... But next time, I will be dining in... lol",

It's thin, greasy, and just delicious! The slices are HUGE...so you don't have to worry about leaving hungry, they offer cheese and pepperoni, but if you want something else....no problem, just let them know and they will throw it on there for you!   If pizza is not your thing, the chicken wings are delicious! It's crispy and the breading is outstanding! The subs are great too, my favorite is the Italian, loaded with fresh topping and served hot.   Everyone is always nice, and the service is very fast! It's definitely worth a visit!",

It's NY style or bust and this place passes muster. For myself I really like their pizza. It's not too greasy like some other nearby places when it comes to their slices. I will say though I don't like their Sicilian pizza at all. It's really dry and doughy and just not to my taste. The fried ravioli was really good the one time I tried it out. So if you're looking for NY style pizza in the Ayrsley area head over to Luigi's!!",

My biggest gripe is the dining room. My wife and I went in to order a whole pizza, we were going to eat a slice or two and take the rest home. Well, I am a big guy and I wouldn't fit in the booths. They only have those cheap Formica table/booths with everything anchored to the floor, nothing is moveable except for two chairs that if you sat in you would literally be sitting halfway in the door. So we got a slice each and sat in the car and ate it. It's a shame because the Dilworth location had normal tables and chairs. I would give them a 3 1/2 for pizza but a 1 for the dining room, so I averaged it to 2 stars. Get smart Luigi and get some tables and chairs. I won't be back until you do.",

It's located in a shopping center & isn't that large of a place. You can get a slice pretty quickly, so if you're in a hurry it's not a bad choice. To me, the pizza tastes just like any other average pizza chain pizza. It's a thin crust type of pizza that I just really don't care for.  Everyone in here is very nice & the service is great, something you won't find at your chain pizza joints. The inside seating reminds me of a cafeteria, but you can usually find a seat for you & a couple friends.  Don't let my biasness of pizza influence you too much, but if you don't prefer the thin crust, average slice of pizza, then there's no need to try out Luigi's. But if you like NY style, then this place must be doing something right, because everyone who's reviewed it has loved this place & its pizza.",

The spinach tasted fresh, lots of creamy ricotta (the last calzone I ordered from somewhere else I had to ask for more ricotta), and very fresh homemade bread.  I like to eat alot so it made me feel great to see how generous they were with the size.  The mushrooms may have been from a can.  It would have been a 5 if the mushrooms were fresh as well.  I give it a 4.75!  We also ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza.  Love the cheese and crust.  If they could get the pepperonis to fold up on the sides (like buffalo pizza) I would give it a 5, definitely worth the money so 4.5!  We also ordered a chef salad.  Definitely a 5!  Only place in Charlotte where I ordered a salad and they aren't afraid to give you a lot of lettuce, generous with the shredded mozzarella, and excellent rolled ham, salami and mozzarella.   In addition, we ordered a pepperoni, sausage, ricotta Stromboli. It was just like the calzone, generous in size and cheeses.  However the grease from the meat made it a little soggy.  I don't know if that can be helped.  I give it a 4.5! If you don't like the corporate pizzas (like Papa Johns)  like me, you will find Luigis to be a delightful delicious surprise!",

I don't really like pizza, but I can't stop thinking about this place. Its going to be a once a week ordeal now.",

Huge slices that are bigger than a standard paper plate, served fresh and hot. Yep, they have other great stuff too. I've bought home a massive calzone (spinach? yes, please) that my wife really enjoyed. As well, their chicken cordon bleu sandwich hits the spot.  But for me, it's the 'za and Luigi's sells it in massive pies or by the slice. Get some!  Note that there are now TWO Luigi's outlets in the area. This one is in the Wal-Mart shopping center. The other one is down in Steele Creek near Target.",

I recall Luigis was consistently the winner of best NYC pizza and it was, and worth the drive.  I now have my own commercial pizza oven and make my own and rarely get pizza out. Well tonight we drove to Luigis and it was the worst pizza Ive had in a long time. It was horribly undercooked with raw onions. It actually gave me a stomach ache. Anyone that thinks this is good probably thinks Olive Garden is great italian food. This isnt the Luigis I remember from years ago.",

I love about a mile away from Luigi's pizza and I heard good things about them so i decided to try it out!! I do NOT regret my decision!! This was the closest I've tasted to NYC style pizza since I've moved here!! The slices were HUGE as well!! I got a slice with sliced sausage (the only pizzeria down here who does sliced sausage) and broccoli and my boyfriend got a pepperoni slice. We also got an order of garlic knots, which were just ok, a little too oily for me. My boyfriend loved them, but that was his first time ever having knots so he had nothing to compare them to. Even the atmosphere was New York style with the man in the back twirling pizza dough in the air!! If you're looking for a good, hot, large slice of pizza, Luigi's is the way to go!!",

Sad really, they have the Mac Donald's service with the prices of the Ritz-Carlton.  I read another review and yes, the writer is right: Do you want some food with your SALT? If you want to know one of the reasons why people have health issues, this restaurant can let you sample it; the incredible amount of salt and oils that they used is shocking! How can you taste the food, when all you have is salt and oil in/on it? Their dessert was ok, will never have them again.  Maybe long ago they were good, but from what I tasted yesterday, which it was 4 meals and 2 desserts, over a $50 bill; it's not worth the trip or ordering anything else but cheese pizza.",

Too many disappointments here in the south with places using the New York City name to sell pizza but then not delivering an authentic pie.  Well not here.  Most people get swept away with the cheese, sauce and toppings but they forget that the crust is the backbone of the pizza.....if the restaurant cuts corners and tries to use regular all purpose flour to make the dough it will show in the final pizza.  Pizza slices and pies so big that they barely fit in the box.  This restaurant is using the Italian semolina flour and doing it the way that a True authentic NYC pizza should be done.  All they need now are Zeppolis.  My only criticism is that the meatballs are $5 to put on a pizza while the other toppings are $2.....expensive.  Will definitely return....",

Also I wouldn't recommend the pizza by he slice except maybe for lunch. The pizza just isn't the same when it's pre-made.

I've only had the pizza, so maybe I need to try a sandwich or something else but they've been voted best pizza.  The mushrooms were canned, not fresh and the sauce I asked for on the side for dipping had a different taste to it, maybe like it had chicken broth in it?  Maybe not, I just expected much better.

They may have large pies, but they really aren't that big going by weight.  I've been to NYC and had pizza at different places, and it's all thicker than Luigi's.  Next is the lack of cheee - it's a pretty thin layer that usually doesn't completely cover the sauce.  The next issue is that the sauce could be a little better altough it is ok.  The last issue, and the one I really have a problem with, is the slimy, cheap canned mushrooms.  They are disgusting.  If franchise pizza places can use fresh mushrooms, then Luigi's can too.  So Luigi's pizza is ok, but far from the perfect and far from the best in Charlotte.  I will take Libretto;s any day over it.",

Before ordering I had asked him what he recommended. He talked me into a steak and cheese sub and I was not disappointed. My wife, who is a fair weather vegetarian, had a bite and finished off half of my sandwich. It really was delicious. Luigi also brought us out a cheese and pepperoni pizza for the kids. It was great as well.  This place has a great atmosphere and feels like a NY pizzeria. Luigi is first-generation from Italy and has honed his pizza skills over the years. We certainly will return and recommend others to try to help.",

I'm such a regular the pizzamen already know my order when I walk in the door. Talk about good customer service! This place is usually packed around lunch time due to the businesses in the area. I always say I'd like to try the Steak & Cheese sandwich but the pizza is just sooo good.",

This pizza is top notch!  The rule was no repeat restaurants while in Charlotte but this place deserved a repeat.  In fact i thought about it every day. The slices are huge and a bang for the buck!  But we still managed to get 2 down each.  1 plain and 1 roni.   I wish there was one closer to us!    This pizza is one  of the best i have ever had. Right up there with Lorenzo's on South St in Philly!  Wish I got to try the cheese steak.   The owner states its' as good as Philly!",

Reading some of these reviews.... if you don't like New York pizza, don't go on Yelp to complain that you wanted/expected something else!  Anywho.....  The slices are huge! They are the biggest I've seen in Charlotte. One slice alone usually fills me up just fine.  The joint is small. I've never had any problems with crowds or wait time, but I haven't been there at peak lunch hour either.  I wish this was a little closer to my place (branch out some new locations!) but if I ever find myself in the Steele Creek area, you know for sure I'm going here.",

    "text": "Best pizza ever in Charlotte!!!! Calzones are amazing, sandwiches are great! We eat there twice a month. Prices are very reasonable. I would rather drive there and pick up our order and bring it home than order a delivered pizza. Any large delivery pizza is smaller and costs more than a small pizza from Louigis. Seriously $12.00 for a 16\" pie ! Their sizes are 16\",18\" & 20\". And they even have a jumbo! If you order by the slice you won't be disappointed. $2.50 a slice. And they are jumbo slices, HUGE!!! Great place for a quick lunch, or a Friday pizza night with the family. You can stand at the window and watch your pizza being tossed in the air and prepared while you wait,( a favorite of my son). Only thing that would make it better would be if the restaurant was a little bigger. I've had to eat in my car a few times during lunch because of how crowded it was. But still very worth it !",
