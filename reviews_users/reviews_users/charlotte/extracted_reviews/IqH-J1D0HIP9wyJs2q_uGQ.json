I must be insane right!  Yes, they are open util 3 am, but stop delivering on FRIDAY at 10:30pm? Huh!?  Someone recommend me a pizza place that is there when I actually need them.",

The tapanade is great as the the fried calamari. They have a large list of pizza by the slice and there individual slice pizza is almost enough for two.  I think its Mondays and Tuesdays that the offer a 3 course meal for only $9.95. Includes a starter, choice of pasta, and dessert.   The added garage doors near the bar do during summer it's almost like sitting on a large patio. This place is never a miss.",

    "text": "We used to visit this location when it was Al's Pizza.  We loved the retro modern decor, menu options, and taste of food.  We tried Libretto's for the first time recently, and it was just kind of average.    Our party of five was seated in the very last large booth.  While these big booths are fantastic for larger parties, they're unfortunately aligned with the open kitchen where we could see the hustle and bustle of the servers, chefs, and delivery people standing around, and then coming and going.  (p.s. That kind of ruins the \"open kitchen\" concept.)  The last booth also gives a fantastic view into the back room with its unflattering fluorescent lighting, the comings and goings of the servers, and the brisk wind from outside due to the propped open back door.    I was going to order one of their specialty pizzas but, unfortunately, I did not.  I opted for the Chicken Francese (Chicken French), because it's a Western NY specialty that you can't typically find outside of Western NY, and I was excited to see it on the menu.  The chicken was just ok.  It didn't have a lot of flavor.  And then I got a pile of plain pasta on the side.  Really?  That's it?  No veggies or anything?  So while it was edible, it was nothing exceptional and I was kicking myself for not trying their pizza which, I'm sure, is much better than their pasta dishes.  The meatball hoagie and calzone that others at the table got looked much better than my somewhat boring entree.    As for the service, it was quite slow.  It was a lonnnnnnnng time before we got our garlic knots appetizer (20 minutes?) and then even longer after that before we got our food.  And then another 5-10 minutes before I could even flag down our disappearing server to bring me Parmesan cheese (that should have been already on our table) to make my bland dish a little more exciting.  We also had to specifically speak up and request our choice of pastas because our server never asked what kind we wanted.    Would we go back?  Possibly.  I would like to give their pizza a taste test.  I certainly wouldn't get a pasta dish again.  And I don't want to sit at the \"back of the bus\" where there's no atmosphere and where the delivery people just hang out, leaning against the walls.",

The baked ziti was ok. I have had better. The cannoli was pretty good (my first time trying one, so I had nothing to compare it to). It had a refrigerated taste to me. So we decided to try it again. I had the shrimp scampi, my boyfriend had the Italian hero, and we split the caprese salad. The hero, and the caprese salad were good. The shrimp scampi was not. The noodles were over cooked and the sauce tasted weird like it was from a can or something. It was like mush with shrimp. This is the last time I will be eating here.",

We sat at a table and ordered, the waitress' (Natalie) excuse was that they had multiple delivery orders before ours. People dining in the restaurant and spending money on drinks should be a priority or at least be told during the wait period what is going on. No one came by to check on us or let us know that they were having issues until after 50 minutes of waiting. And they did not comp anything after all of our trouble. Once the pizza finally came out, It was undercooked and soggy. They clearly took It out of the oven early because they knew how long It had been. Don't waste your time or money here, I would eat at Papa Johns before I came back.",

    "text": "I have been to the Ballantyne location once before and had a decent experience, so I decided to try the Park Road Libretto's, as I live around the corner from this location. It's safe to say that our experience was awful from start to finish.   When we were seated in the bar area, it took our waitress 10 minutes to greet us and bring menus. She was rude from the beginning. We ordered mozzarella sticks and a beer.  5 more minutes pass and she finally comes back. I say I have a question about the menu, about what veggies are included in one of the dishes (I was interested in ordering dinner). She gave me an attitude saying she didn't know and would have to find out. Well, yeah duh that's kind of what I was asking her to do.....no need to be so rude about it. She also tells me they are out of mozzarella sticks and we should pick something else. So we say cheese garlic bread and garlic knots.  Wait another 20 minutes for the food to come out. Some guy brings it to us, except it doesn't have any cheese on it. I let the guy know and he said \"oh you're right! I'll have them throw some cheese on it for you, It should only take like 30 seconds.\" He takes my food back to the kitchen. We eat our 4 garlic knots, and wait for the food to come back.  Wait another 10 minutes, and the waitress finally brings the garlic bread out. \"Oh you changed your mind and wanted to add cheese?\" ...uhhh no, we ordered it that way. She said \"oh I only heard garlic bread\" with an attitude. She asked if we wanted to order anything else (hah - after 45 minutes + her attitude, definitely not!). Then we asked for the check.   I have never eaten at a restaurant and NOT left a tip, but tonight was the exception. I have never had such horrible service, and it's safe to say this was our first and last experience at Libretto's Park Road. They have done nothing at all to earn my repeat business. We will take our business elsewhere next time.",

It was an easy breezy Sunday afternoon so it wasn't crowded and the atmosphere was nice and chill. I got the pizza by the slice and the slices were huge and delicious. I love for my cheat meals to count & this place made it worth my while! My server was super cool. He knew it was my splurge so he offered me a cannoli when I finished but I was too full! He said they were the best in town. I've never had a cannoli before but he was so convincing that I'll be sure to pick Libretto's for my first one. :)",

Both were amazing and huge (and I'm not a plain ole cheese kinda girl)! And they deliver . . . extra bonus!!  I ordered a large margherita with half portobello and half pepperoni for delivery last weekend (too lazy to cook). Again it's a huge pizza with perfect crust! Other than the toppings shifting during delivery (2 slices were nothing but tomato sauce and a little basil), it was wonderful! My husband enjoyed it and he's somewhat picky!  I lucked out and got a Groupon for dine in. With delivery nowadays, it's not often we go out for pizza. But we'll look forward to a casual date night soon with our Groupon!  I highly recommend Librettos for a delicious filling pizza!!!!",

Ummm to sit for lunch.... this is when we were to just go ahead so we picked our own table and the person who \"greeted\" us was apparently our server who didn't even know the drink menu. Asked me to pass the table tent to her so she could read it. She had to flip through the pages to get to Saturday's drink menu and proceeded to read it to us. When we finally ordered we wanted a 14\" half cheese half chicken Parmesan and the \"server\" obliged. After waiting a long time for this Pizza (keep in mind, we were one of the only customers in the place minus the two people at the bar), our \"server\" (who's name is Jennifer) brought us over an enormous pizza. I quickly say wow that's a huge Pizza. That's the 14\"?! She said no that's the 18\", the chicken parm only comes in that size. I said well if i had known that, we would not had ordered it. She never specified this to us so when she walked away, i went to look at the menu and noticed you can get this pizza in any size. I hear a shout from across of the restaurant asking what i wanted. I quickly said \"a manager\" and sat back down. Our \"server\" Jennifer came back and rudely said, the manager is taking care of it. Where i replied, i still wanted to speak to them. After waiting forever, we ask another person for a to go box and they basically threw it down on our table. A manager never showed up and I promise you that i will never return to your establishment ever again and i have no problem letting more people know about this.",

Maybe that was a strong word, but I was suprised.  It was clean, new, and not run-down or messy at all.  It was refreshing to come into a nice restaurant to eat.   Service - Carrie was helpful and took care of our crew of 10. She was attentive and took care of our order despite the questions we had asked about the size of the pizzas and what draft beers are carried.  Food - We had: - Chicken Florentine:  I personally liked the pizza, it has your typical chicken and veggies, which was good. Some of the people were 'meh' about it.  - Anchovies and Mushroom: I did not eat this, but everyone else loved it. - Tuscany: Was so-so  The food came out quick, did not have to wait too long. So that was a plus. Liked they had the $3 draft beer special.  Price - I did think the price of the pizza was a bit pricey, especially for a large and a medium.  Large will get you 8 large slices, Medium have 6, and a small will get you 4 slices.  Overall, I would not mind coming back here agian for some pizza and good company.  If it was just myself or with my husband, it would be too much for us to finish.",

Girl who answered couldn't figure out how to add a new address to a new phone number and after 5+ minutes trying, put me on hold for the manager to help.  After a few minutes another person got on, and same thing happened again.    My girlfriend called while I was on hold waiting for the manager, so I went to talk to her and was disconnected in the meantime.   Called back, asked to speak to the manager right off the bat, and even the manager took time to figure out how to deliver to a new address.  This time I was ordering for delivery to a hotel since it had been so long and we weren't going to be at our new place.    Same issue with hotel, took 5 minutes to figure out the address.  Finally got order in and was told 60 minutes.  75 minutes later I called and was put on hold for another 5 minutes without even being acknowledged, finally got to ask the whereabouts of my order and was told any minute.    Delivery finally showed up 85 minutes after ordering and of course one of the pizzas was the wrong order.  Tried calling back to let them fix it, hold again forever and I finally hung up.  To the manager's credit, she called back using caller ID or the number on my order, but by then I finally had a bite of lukewarm pizza and had lost my patience.    I hear Mellow Mushroom pizza is pretty good.  Will try that and many more before giving Libretto's another chance.",

When we called to inquire about the time, the manager stated that a person typed the info in wrong.  They'd be here in 25 minutes.  When we pressed the issue he then said that the person waiting tables put the order in late.  He stated he was in the back helping with paperwork which is why he couldn't help when they were apparently too busy to place an order.  No apology, no trying to make it right.  Some Bro is in management and had every excuse in the books but no interest in fixing the issue or repairing a bad experience.  Bad news.",

Me and the mouse scurried over here after catching a flick that ended as 12AM - which is awesome bc this place is open until 3AM!  We split a pepperoni & jalapeno pizza which was decent, but didn't blow me away.  Looked like a bunch of locals would drop in for a late-night beer and pizza - I know I would.  Oh wait, that's pretty much what I did.  Hm, is it sick that I kind of want to go over there right now at 1AM for late-night beer and pizza?    I like this place to wind down the evening.  dmo out.",

So I ordered from the other store 5 miles away at Park Road Shopping Center.  Anyways they took the order ok and said itll be 45 mins. I called at 1 hour and 20 mins asking where the delivery was..they said the driver came to my house and we didn't answer? (didn't ring doorbell? My family was here with me on New Years Day ready for a movie night, hungry just waiting to call.  We finally called at 1:20 thinking something wrong.   When asked why didnt they call if there was a problem, they said they tried to call my phone but it stated it wasn't in service?  This is the same phone I'm using right now to type this review and rings all the time.  This operation is terrible they'll be out of business if they don't hire some better people.  I think they just lost my order so they lied to me and said they couldn't reach me. They were rude when I called to check!  The guy told me he was the manager who sounded like a teenager. Who knows.",

I was really excited to stay with my sister and discover there was a location just  over a mile away.   We ordered through the app for delivery. A confirmation email was sent with the expected delivery time. Cool....!!!! Pizza was 90 minutes away. They were 45 minutes late. When we called about the order,  the person up front said the delivery guy had left a while ago and it will be there shortly. When the guy arrived, he was unsure of the delivery location (we flagged him down), and the pizza was cold .   Next time I will pick up the pizza or the app needs to accurately set delivery expectation times.",

The slices are thin, greasy, and foldable! The salads are standard. The spaghetti is good, although salty. They aren't as quick as other pizza joints, but maybe I'm not used to waiting 25-30 minutes.  Pro and con: They only deliver in a very small area. Lucky you if you are within their zone. I'm about 1.5-2 miles away and either the website is not updated or truly they have a very, very small delivery area.  When I'm in the mood for yummy, foldable pizza, Libretto's is where I'll turn.",

    "text": "I'm a big of Libretto's and have enjoyed the other two locations in town for some time. Happy to say that the newest location (here) has easily topped my list for a number of reasons.   First, the menu is easy. Family recipes that aren't overly presented, spiced, salted, or done with too much fluff. I'm not the biggest Italian fan in the world, but when I do go for Italian, I tend to gravitate to the more puristic menu items. Libretto's recipes are made with love and it's pretty easy to tell. Recently tried the traditional spinach pie calzone and the veggie pinwheel. Both are served with a small side of perky marinara and aren't of ungodly, gargantuan proportion. I appreciate the size to price ratio.  The kicker for this location is easily the bar/patio area(s). HUGE patio that wraps around the corner, front patio with some umbrellas over 4-tops, and giant garage doors that open to the bar. We sat on the patio around 12:30pm and it was perfectly shaded, breezy, and comfortable. How can you sit on that patio and not knock back a beer or six? Also, check out the mural at the end of the bar on the far wall. Gives it a really cool Brooklyn vibe.   Props to Libretto's on this new location. Looking forward to more patio time really soon.   Cheers.",

The guy who seated me also took my drink order, then placed my food order as soon as he came back. After that, I was subsequently ignored. The waitress only checked on me once and that was from the middle of the room. She didn't even refill my drink until I asked for my check. The calzone itself was ok. It seemed like they simply slapped ricotta and mozzarella in without a care, instead of mixing it together. But, maybe that's just how they make their calzones. There was also no seasoning used, it relied only on the various flavors of the ingredients.",

I thought I was going to be apart of the first 100 to come and receive free pizza for a year. I was sadly mistaken lol That's Saturday (7/27/2013) for the free Za for a year. Amazing offer!!! Can't pass that up if you can get there. I went for lunch with a couple of co-workers and two of them had lunch specials. One had half a hero with a side salad and soda and the other had a slice of cheese with a side salad. I had a personal sized pizza with Spinach and six of the Garlic & Butter wings. Our waitress was fun and giggly (not giggidy lol) but, didn't know the menu yet or, what diet soda was. My lunch guest asked what diet sodas they have and our waitress asked us \"is lemonade diet?\" Hilarious, she was really nice. I was thinking they were going to be slammed with people but it was just us and a couple of other folks. With that being said, I was surprised how slow the service was and how long the food took. I would think they would have had a few cheese pizzas ready \"on deck\" for lunch slices. My lunch buddy that ordered the slice didn't get it until we were ready to leave. Over an hour. The salads were fresh, and the Hot Italian Hero was good, no complaints there. The Garlic & Butter wings were cooked fresh but a little greasy and it hurts me to say this, there was a long feather...still attached...sad. I'll keep the pic to myself. My pizza was okay. My co-worker enjoyed it more than I did. Just a few things that Libretto's needs to work on. I would say time management in the kitchen to get food out quick and hot. Our food was brought out one item at a time I know this isn't their first location so, they've got it!. Libretto's will be a great lunch destination, just give them some time to work into their new space. Hopefully I will be going back to try some pastas and other delicious menu items. Check them out!!",

When I arrived, they didn't even have the order. They tried to shrug it off as if I ordered at the wrong location and that I was supposed to print the order confirmation...what terrible and insulting excuses! I rendered the order confirmation email on my iPhone, proving to them that I did order and pay for the requested pizzas. The employee went back and \"found\" the order and asked me to wait as they fire up the pizzas... I left. There is a reason why I ordered online. I will NOT be coming here again.",

The pizza is as authentic as you can get outside of the city, and the soups and salads are great, too. I have yet to have a bad meal. Delivery was slow for a bit but it seems they've fixed it.

The young lady on the phone also said my number, which we were speaking one, wasn't a valid number or this wouldn't have happened. She continued to be unfriendly, blaming us for our food not being there/ready, when the food was never there in the first place.

They are my go to here and order every time- Delicious! I have also tried the pepperoni knots and they are tasty but usually opt for the classic garlic knots. Their pizza is pretty good but not what you would find in NY but that is hard to find down here. I will also add  I usually order by the slice but you can also get whole pies. I hear the Diavolo is the ticket here. Sounds really good. The pasta dishes aren't bad either but I think I will stick to the apps and pizza. Oh the calamari is good here too.  I will leave you with this . It's also a good pace to have a few beers (usually have some good beers on draft and on special) at the bar and watch some football (especially if you like Oklahoma) .  Order some tapenade and watch football because what two things go together better than tapenade and football :)",

I don't have an issue paying extra for toppings, but basically this was a cheese pizza with  enough toppings for 2 out of the 8 slices.

It's a good price for a large pie, especially compared to the other wood-fired pizza places in the area. Don't get me wrong, I adore wood-fired pizza, but for a classic \"New York style\" at a fair price, this is the best I've found since moving to Charlotte about six months ago. Having eaten a fair share of real NY pizza, it is incredibly disappointing, but good enough. The garlic knots are terrible. Don't waste your money.",

We waiting 5 minutes at the front for a table because no one was there. One the hostess showed up she asked \"Can I help you?\" and we were then told \"sit where you want.\" Not a problem! A sign could have been helpful.   Server was not knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered cheese sticks as an appetizer, a 10 inch pizza and chicken parm with a side salad.   Cheese sticks where burnt to the point there was no cheese in them and had a bitter taste. Server was happy to take that away and offer a replacement (we declined).   Ordered the chicken parm with penne pasta. It arrived with spaghetti instead. Ok - not a problem. Good flavor, pasta was well cooked, chicken crispy with lots of gooey baked cheese.   The problem came when the pizza arrived almost 20 minutes after the chicken parm. While waiting we saw bags and bags of pizza walk out the door. Server finally came over about 10 minutes after receiving the first entree and to let us know there were a lot of delivery orders and the kitchen was backed up....  Long story short. If you want pizza get it delivered. It will be there faster than dining in.",

Better yet... they DELIVER to my house.  Okay, so none of you probably care about that. Let's focus on the things we can all appreciate. This Parktowne location has a killer bar and patio area. They have the garage-like doors that open up into the patio. So nice.   And like all the LLs (that's slang for Libretto's locations... not to be confused with Cool J), you can expect the same delicious food. My two favorite pies are the Buffalo Chicken and the IL Diavolo (pepperoni, spicy sausage, jalapenos and roasted garlic).  It's a great place for lunch. You can easily get a pasta dish, side salad and drink for less than ten bucks. Pizza by the slice is also available: BONUS: Libretto's has punch cards for both pizza slices (buy 10 slices, get one free) and lunch entrees (buy 5, get one free).  Tons of specials throughout the week. Here are some of the highlights:  Wednesday: Half priced apps 4-7pm 1/2 priced bottles of Wine   Thursday: Half Price bar menu from 4-7pm $3 Craft Beers & $3 Drafts  Saturday: Brunch Pizzas $4 Mimosas, $5 Bloody Marys, and $10 Bottomless Bellinis and $5 flavored vodka bombs  Sunday: Kids eat free (if you don't like to be in a restaurant full of children... you may want to skip this day)  Another great restaurant by Mr. Mike Libretto. Spoiler alert: he's a hell of a great guy, too!",

The visit before last our pizza was gross and I also witnessed the kitchen staff spending alot of time in the bar area watching tv. Worst of all I decided to leave after watching the same kitchen employee enter the bathroom two times in less than thirty minutes wearing his apron. Gross.

It overlooks a large outdoor seating area and has 2 garage doors that can be opened when the weather is warmer.    The bartender was pleasant and knowledgeable.  I asked what kind of local drafts they had and they actually had quite a selection from OMB, NoDa, Triple C and Birdsong.    For the menu, they have several lunch specials a decent prices. I went with a slice of pizza and a salad with their house dressing.   The dressing was interesting.  It was a spicy balsamic vinagrette.  The salad was in a small bowl and was basically a punch of fluffed up greens with shaved parm on top.  It would have been easier to eat and more presentable on a small salad plate.  The pizza slice was large and tasted decent.  I wish it came with more sauce though.  Overall, decent place.  I enjoyed sitting at the bar.  Pizza is decent - not the best but certainly better than many other places.  I will come back here once in a while.",

I then sat for 15 minutes for my food, with no offer for anything to drink or a partial refund for the wait or anything. I'm not sure if the online ordering is down or if the staff was just not paying attention, however individuals on lunch breaks do not have time for 45 minute wings nor does it make me feel any better by the customer service I received.   I then went to their website to contact them and let them know their online ordering is messed up etc, and their contact page on the website wouldn't submit comments either.",

It was frustrating that every single time it would take anywhere from 5-15 minutes just to pick up and pay for the pizzas (which would be ready). They never had enough staff at the front counter. But after our last order, we cannot give them our business any more. We ordered 2 pizzas and 2 salads and sent our son to pick them up. He returned with the 2 salads, and the explanation that they were sorry but couldn't make the pizzas because they ran out of cheese. And they still made him pay for the salads! My wife immediately called them, and while there was a half-hearted apology, there was no explanation other than they thought they had enough cheese when they took the order.  How does a pizza place run out of cheese?  Could they not run to the grocery store across the street and buy some?  How about a phone call to let us know they weren't going to have our pizzas?  Or an attempt to win us back by offering something when my wife called?  Clearly they don't want our business, and we will not be giving it to them.",

The crust was overcooked and there was hardly any cheese inside. I told the Manager that the crust was burnt and she said they have to bake it that way or the cheese does not cook.  I disagree.  It was tough and didn't even taste that good.  The pizza was very good.  Also, the website lists the Calzone at $6.95 but it's really $7.95 (another disappointment that their website has not been updated).  My order was to go so I didn't have the option to send the calzone back.",

Was looking to carb-up on pasta and definitely got my fix in.  Our server was nice enough, but there were a couple times where we were looking for her.  Not a big deal, but I would see it as an issue if we were in a rush - and I could understand if the place was slammed, but we were surrounded by empty tables.  Ordered the stuffed mushrooms - wasn't disappointed here.  Pre-entree salads weren't overly dressed and our entrees were definitely ginormous portion-sized.  I cut it in half and took a box home for another meal.  Whoops - almost forgot.  Penne alla vodka with grilled chicken.  Hard to mess up, but it was decent.  Overall, I would say this place was okay.  I would probably come back for the casual atmosphere and the \"non-crowd\" factor - a great option for dinner if you are craving some Italian.  I'm sure there are other, more popular, Italian spots in the area that would steal your attention away from Libretto's.",

As a business traveler, my needs are fairly simple: food that's fast, hot, reasonably priced and brought to my room by a polite person. All those criteria were met this evening. I ordered a calzone (with sausage spinach and kalamata olives), along with some broccoli and tiramisu. The food was flavorful and delicious, while not too greasy or oily.  My only gripe would be in the notes section when ordering I asked to have the broccoli well done and black olives in the calzone, but I can understand how that would be an easy miss.  Thanks for the good service and great food!",

Towards the left and back area of the restaurant is a separate bar, where the 45 second music bingo was being held. It was so much fun as the staff and DJ were very laid back, positive, and encouraging. On Wednesdays the restaurant has half off glasses of wine and bottles of wine. I ordered the riesling and lambrusco, which were both amazing and not super sweet.   The bingo was super fun and something different to do on a Wednesday night. It went from 7:30pm to 9:30pm, so not super late so if you have work the next morning and want to have a couple of drinks you can make it there! You can definitely have a few as my tab for two glasses if wine was $7.50!! The food smelled delicious too, but I was stuffed from dinner before.  The service overall was great. Our waitress was very attentive and made me feel wanted there. I think I will definitely come back for the drinks and fun whenever I am in Charlotte.",

Service was quick and friendly. I ordered the Tuscan salad with added chicken, and couldn't resist trying the garlic knots ($2 - great life choice). The overall menu had a good variety of Italian-esque options, and I was pleased to see healthier options mixed in amongst the variety of pasta dishes, pizzas, and calzones.

If you want a relaxing meal in a laid back environment I suggest the bar area of Librettos. The dining area is probably for families or something. I've never sat in there.

The mozzarella is different, I ordered the lasagna and it's the Sysco special.  But undercooked to begin with.  Get back to your roots.  You suck.  Mike, so just terrible cooks than?   Or a careless attitude about what you put out.  Currently reheating my lasagna in the oven.  The same lasagna I used to sell when I WORKED FOR SYSCO.  My fav.  It comes in the microwaveable container.  Mike, thanks for checking it out. But this location is going downhill.  Lasagna was made wrong.  Fried mozzarella sucked, tiramisu sitting in the pan to long and served with a BEAT strawberry.  Calzone was good.  But it might be time to spend a minute there. You have quite a few questionable reviews, which I did not realize until I posted this one.  PS lasagna noodles cooked so dead I could not even tell they were in there.   I NEVER post bad reviews.",

Is told there were busy, I guess to busy to complete an order. I took a bite into my pizza, the 2nd slice.  To my disgusting surprise I had to pull a pice of hair out of my mouth.  Needless to say after having to wait an extra hour the pizza, it went into the trash.  This is my second issue with this restaurant.  It is too bad because the pizza is usually pretty good.",

On a good note, there's a lot of options in that area for food and drinks.",

The waitress was very nice and courteous.  We ordered two pizzas, two pasta entrees and a salad.  It took a long time before we got our food and the food did not come out at the same time (there were not that many people).  My wife and son had already finished their pizzas before my daughter and I were served our pasta entrees.  The pizzas were good.  The salad was okay, the croutons were stale.  My pasta entree was really good, I ordered the Rigatoni Palermo but substituted the marinara sauce with Alfredo sauce.  I went there to enjoy a lunch with the family,  but we ended up eating at different times.  The restaurateurs need to be focusing not only on serving good food but on the experience they offered to customers",

We've even heard a rumor that they import water for the dough from New York.  My Husband and I have been to the EpiCenter and Woodlawn locations many times.  Each have their own feel.  This post describes the Woodlawn location.  We always sit in the bar area.  They have TVs with sports on, daily drink specials, and good hot food.  Our favorite is the Bianca Pizza.  It is Mozzarella...maybe Parmesan, and dollops of Ricotta.  The crust is perfect.  It is thin and crispy and can go up against any pizza in Manhattan.  Get Marinara on the side if you're into that.  The service is friendly.  All In all this is a good casual spot for good food and a good time.",

I have had like 5 experiences with bad service to the point it feels like no one has training.  1) No one coming to the front desk for TEN minutes with an empty restaurant. 2) Server who doesn't know the menu, specials, or how to do the check MULTIPLE times. 3) Showing up to pick up online order and being rudely told they didn't have one of the dishes? Don't most people call you and ask if you want something else? Frustrating to wait an hour for dinner to not have it.  I will say, the bartenders are always great, but otherwise it feels like the staff needs some serious training before they run out more loyal customers. So therefore, you'd probably be better suited going somewhere else. Too bad, because the pizza is awesome and we love it.",

Parking can be a challenge at the place but mostly because there are lots of other businesses as restaurants here.   We showed up for lunch a little after 1pm on a Friday.  There were approximately 4 tables being occupied at the time.  We waited at the front desk to get seated for close to 5 minutes - that should've been our first clue.    A guy came out from the back and looked lost but didn't apologize for our wait or greet us.  When I asked for a table instead of a booth, he said oh good because all of the booths are dirty.    It turned out that he was the hostess and only waiter for the restaurant.    He tried his very best and worked hard to keep up but there's only so much that one person can do!   We placed our drink, appetizer and pizza order at the same time to make it easier on him and because we are familiar with Libretto's menu.    Food took forever to come out.  I can only assume that the kitchen staff is also short staffed.    For our appetizer, we ordered the calamari and when it came out it was good but the jalapenos and cherry peppers outnumbered the calamari. Not a good thing for someone who doesn't like spicy food.   When the 18 inch New Yorker came out, it looked good but I'm not sure it was cooked fully.  The ingredients didn't taste like they normally do and some of the bell peppers were crunchy or hard.   Hour an a half for \"lunch\" on a week day.",

Between the two of us, we have had subs, pizza, pasta, calzones and their famous Pinwheels -- quite the spectrum. I actually recently tried their Pinwheels for the first time and loved them. They're basically buns stuffed with cheese and two toppings of your choice, served with marinara sauce for dipping. Amazeballs. We can't wait to return now that we'll be back in the area. Pinwheels, here we come!",

I have crossed them off the list for good.   1.) Called in and ordered 10 pizzas, only 5 were delivered. The person taking my order did not input it correctly. Had to have the rest of our order made and re-delivered 45 minutes later... only half of the people could eat, the other half had to wait..  2.) Had 10+ pizza's delivered, all but a couple were smashed! Looked like the driver had them in his backseat and they slid off onto the floor. Most were un-edible but we picked through it since we had a short time frame for lunch. I called to speak with the General Manager but he was too busy. The guy i spoke to did give us 50% off.. I asked the GM to call me back later when he's free.. never heard from him.  3.) I decided to give them one more chance.. Pizza's were delivered OK but we didn't receive our catering salad or the dressing. I told the driver and he said he forgot it and went back to the store to get it. Came back 30 minutes later.. everyone had already finished eating so it was a waste.   It's a shame. Their pizza is pretty good.. most of the time but the management is terrible and doesn't seem to care. My Company orders pizza a couple times a month and they just lost all of our business!",

When we got there to pick it up, they said they never received the order. I understand these things can happen. It looked like only two staff were in the whole place anyway.  Then they were out of the mozzarella sticks so I had to change to the the zucchini fritters. I finally get this order home, and the zucchini fritters tasted like they just came out of the freezer they were so cold. I tried to heat them up in the microwave but they still didn't taste good and I ended up throwing them away. The other appetizer I ordered was cold as well, I ate a few bites but then ended up having to throw that away too. Disappointing and will probably not go back and was a waste of money.",

First thing hit yelp looking at reviews came across a lot of pretty good ones but on weekdays were closed at 9 pm Librettos is open till 11 pm I'm in!!!!  So I call ask if they deliver and yes they do, perfect. I order a large with my favorite toppings pepperoni, sausage (they have sweet or spicy) I got spicy, and bell peppers (theirs are red and green roasted) but I liked it. So I give them the address to the hotel.  20 min later pizza showed up hot and ready. Most places where I live in California take like 45 min so this was a plus. Pizza was great !!!!  Also when they delivered the pizza they brought paper plates and napkins. Guess they thought since I was staying in a hotel I might need them. And yup I did   Will for sure call them again next time in town",

Always ignored the staff attitudes and awkward cashier experience where you feel like you're doing them a favor by ordering (when they finally pay attention to you) because the slices are pretty good and like back home (Long Island). Met my sister there for lunch where as she ordered her slice which looked as it had been sitting on the counter for a while....before it even went in the oven a fresh pie comes out and she asks \"actually, can I get one of the hot slices instead\" where the staff member tosses the old slice in the oven and says \"you already ordered\", doesn't even look at her and goes back to writing....are you f'in kidding me ?!! She had to drag me out before I made a scene. Good pizza & great Sicilian unfortunately not good enough to put up with that bulls&$t.

As for the food, the pizza is delicious and has just the right amount of crust and sauce. The salads are also done well, and a nice add-on to any entree.

The sausage is the good Italian sausage that is in flat slices like pepperoni, not that round stuff you get from papa johns or dominos. Service is good. Place is cool. Bar is good. Lots of TVs in the bar area. Outdoor seating. Oh, and get the bruschetta! That olive tapenade that comes with it is awesome! If you like olives, that stuff is like crack. Chopped kalamatas, a little tomato, basil, oil (I'm making assumptions here). Whatever is in it, it's good. The place ain't cheap, but it's not gonna break the bank either, worth it.",

    "text": "I made this account just to write this review; I had quite the negative experience with Libretto's.  I placed an order for a pizza and some garlic knots on their website. I received an email confirming my order, which stated I could expect my food in 45-60 minutes. After waiting 90 minutes I called to request an update. The person that answered the phone was extremely rude. After explaining the reason for my call, the person said \"it'll be out in a little bit\" and then hung up on me. No further explanation was given nor was any apology offered. They didn't even ask what I ordered. I was treated as if I was the one at fault and as if my call was a burden.   I waited another 30 minutes (bringing the total wait time to 2 hours) before calling back to cancel my order. When I called this time, I was told that they never received my order in the first place (why wasn't I told this the first time I called?). This is despite the fact that I had received a confirmation email. I asked them to cancel my order, which they said they could not do since they never received the order in the first place. However when I checked my bank account online, I had in fact been charged for the food. I do not know if it was malice or incompetence that led to them \"unknowingly\" charging me. Regardless of the cause, the end result was I had to call my bank to dispute the charge and get it removed.   I would strongly recommend taking your money elsewhere. Literally any other option is a better choice than dealing with Libretto's.",

    "text": "All the cool kids like this place.  And I want to like it.  I have tried twice (in two different locations) to like it and meh - not again.  Today's lunch was a huge fail in practically every aspect.    The new spot is lovely, well decorated and should make for a pleasant dining experience.  I was instantly greeted and seated upon entering.  There was one other gentleman there banging away on his laptop and a few minutes later a table of 4 was sat.  That's it.  At 11:30 on a Friday, we were it.    Not a fan of the pizza at their Ballantyne location (personal preference), I thought I would try a sandwich.  I ordered the grilled chicken with mozzarella and peppers sandwich lunch special for $8 with fries.  I waited.  And waited.  And waited... my waitress came by about 20 minutes into my wait to let me know the kitchen was working on a huge delivery order, and while I appreciated the update, the reason as to why it was taking an eternity for a freakin' sandwich is inconsequential.  Shortly thereafter she brought the sandwich, no fries, and told me the fries had been dropped and would be out in a few minutes.  Um... okay.  The wait for my food had allowed me to listen to the DMB, Hootie, (that douchey guy that keeps getting much hotter girls that plays guitar) music and the guys in the kitchen going back and forth about one of their f'in girlfriends and her habits that are annoying to him.  As with the Ballantyne location, the voices from the kitchen and the language is disruptive.  With a fairly open floor plan, high ceilings and solid-surface floors, it reverberates.  I'll get off of my rocking chair yelling at kids to get off my lawn and back to the food... the sandwich should be called a pepper sandwich with cheese and chicken bits.  The grilled chicken, charred as I imagine only the temperature from the flames of hell would produce that shade of black on a chicken, was about 1/2 of a very thin chicken breast (think the Perdue thin cuts from the grocery store, but not an entire breast, just 1/2).  The black edges and end pieces would break off as I bit into the sandwich, but since we were 30 minutes in, I trudged on after dissecting the sandwich to see if I was just getting bad bites, or if the sandwich really was that bad.  Loaded with peppers, the peppers were cooked well and well flavored.  The mozzarella, while not much of it, was fine.  The bread was fine. All I could taste were carcinogens and peppers.  I was about 1/2 way done with my sandwich when the fries came.  They were smoking hot and good.  The kind that are soft on the inside and super crunchy on the outside.  I was then brought a small cup of ketchup, that was enough for about 1/2 of the fries.  Service was fine, kitchen staff was loud, food was yuck (1/5 for sandwich, 3.5/5 fries -the highlight of dining should not be french fries), the wait for the food was not justified by the quality of it, the portion of the meal was very reasonable for the price.    At 0-fer-2, Libretto's gets my Pawpaw's smackdown - \"I ain't goin' back\".",

Another clue of how the food would be is when the table is stocked with granulated garlic and Italian herb mix.

I have been working in the industry for 10 years so I try not to complain unless something really rubs me the wrong way.   The first 4 months I ordered from Librettos Parktowne they messed up my order every single time. They would forget marinara sauces for my entire order, not include special prep items that were paid for, or not get my order until an hour after I ordered. This almost turned me away but the food is just so good.  After I spoke with the manager things seemed to get better. This was until about 3 months ago.  Every single order I've made since then has taken over an hour and 15 minutes to get and every time I've called at the 1 hour mark and they've told me.....\"its sitting right here. The delivery driver is about to leave.\" I just think this is unacceptable.  Food is great but if you want fast good service this is not the place for you.",

But a buddy of mine and I have been heavily craving some good pizza so we decided to get a large pie for carry out. We called ahead, placed our order and were told to come by in 15 minutes. (They're going to start delivery for their Woodlawn location very soon. A week or so, she said). Anyways, we arrived in about 10 minutes and our pizza was ready! Piping hot and smelling all kinds of amazing.   We brought it back to the apartment and it did not disappoint. The flavor was excellent, the cheese, crust, all of that. Terrific. Definitely coming back again. Hopefully can avoid the drive and have it delivered.   What I liked: the pizza was ready faster than expected, it tasted great, the person who took my order and helped in person was very friendly, reasonably priced, and  it's open late, AND the sell pizza by the slice, too.   Gotta love the new location. Definitely check it out. It's the closest thing to NY pizza I've had in Charlotte so far.   A+",

However this experience was VERY different! The wait time was 45 minutes according to my order confirmation email but it did not arrive to my door for an hour and a half. When I got the food and opened it up to eat, it looked like soup with something in it, there was so much liquid in the dish. The noodles were way overcooked. The chicken was under cooked, was rubbery and disgusting. I immediately called the restaurant and was told they were busy and someone would call me right back. No one ever called, to this day. I then got online and emailed the company to try and reach someone there. It has been over a month and I still have not heard from anyone. Needless to say I couldn't eat my dinner that I had paid over $20 for and needed to eat to take my medicines, and was very upset. I still am.   Don't waste your time or money at this restaurant.",

    "text": "My husband and I were staying at the Aloft for the weekend and came in to grab a pizza and calzone about 1am on a Sunday morning after drinking at Tilt all evening.  It was pretty crowded but we got our food relatively fast and headed back up to our room.  Everything was fine, but nothing was outstanding--absolutely average.  If I was in uptown Charlotte late at night and I was craving pizza, I'd go here again.  Otherwise, I'd try somewhere else.",

    "text": "I wouldn't walk in Libretto's again if you paid me. Came in for a quick beer while waiting on some take out. The bartender was quite caught up in arguing with a manager to notice us. When he finally did, it was almost as if we were inconveniencing him. When our food was finally ready, we continued to wait for him to bring his heated point on home directly in front of us before finally handing is our tab. I was almost sure it was an April Fool's joke. The food was less than stellar as well. I didn't know tomatoes could be greasy or that fries were best served hot on the outside, cold on the inside. Gross. Had the food even been decent, it might've made up somewhat for the complete lack of professionalism or courtesy.",

    "text": "Placed a delivery order today. Got a phone call 50 minutes after placing the order apologizing that my order was late. I was told that they had no romaine lettuce for my Caesar salad and would I be ok with iceberg which tells me they were just starting to fill my order. I was also told that my order was going out the door immediately. 35 minutes later I called back because my food still hadn't shown up. I live .5 miles from the restaurant and google maps says it takes 3 minutes to get to my house. The manager informed me that my order went out with several other orders and that it should be there shortly. When you call somebody to apologize for their order being late and tell them their order is going out the door immediately you are setting an expectation that their order would be there soon. I was offered nothing for my inconvenience. Won't order from them again.",

    "text": "Ordered delivery rather late on a Friday. Didn't seem to have the same late arrival issues that others have had, but I was also pretty close to this location.   Ordered an Italian hero assuming it would be the bomb diggity, with lots of that salty herby spicy authentic flavor... It was alright, but the bread to meat and cheese ratio was skewed, more on the bready side. The meats are super thin sliced, which is fine, I just expected a lot more. Provolone was very thin as well, and there were only a few half slices on my sandwich. Hot cherry peppers and vinaigrette added flavor to an otherwise bland tasting sandwich.   Would like to try their other menu offerings sometime, but I'm in no hurry.",

    "text": "The white pizza is the best thing on the menu besides the sicilian chopped salad (without olives yuck!!). I typically go for lunch, the slices are hit or miss.. sometimes better than others, sometimes over cooked more than other times. Service is spotty... two times I asked for no olives, had olives both times... another visit ordered garlic knots and never received... still keep going back for the white pizza. Ordered out and had delivered last weekend cheese pizza/pepperoni and it was really good. I have not tried any non-pizza items yet besdies the salad.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to have a late cheat night (around 11pm). We reluctantly ordered from this place knowing we were probably going to be disappointed because of past experiences and friends who warned us. We definitely were. We ordered a small Margherita add spicy sausage and pepperoni knots to go. We wanted a dinner salad to share and dessert as well but they weren't serving that stuff at the time (Which is odd to me on a Friday night when you're open til 3am...). Anyways, we finally get the pizza and knots home (we live about 3 minutes drive away) both the pizza and knots were cold, the knots were over cooked and burnt and the pizza was a sloppy mess of cold cheese, cold sauce and NO sausage. We were charged for the sausage that was not on the pizza as well. This is definitely not the best pizza in Charlotte, far from it. We will not be returning. Save yourself the money and go somewhere decent.",

I had the lasagna and a side of mushrooms and just so you know this place was more than your average pizza place it was more of a fine dining experience.  The sauces and cheese on the Lasagna was good and you must try the stuffed mushrooms they are absolutely the best.   The server was excellent but I was thrown off by the delivery driver that kept walking back and forth throughout our stay it was very unprofessional.   I will visit this place again it was great to receive good service and food under one roof for a change.",

The first delivery man brought only the chicken Marsala then realized he forgot everything and said he'd come back. 30 minutes later a new delivery guy shows up tells us the last guy was fired (so unprofessional) and delivers the pizza... No salads and tells us we won't be charged. We call the manager and he tells us we will be charged and asks if we still want the salads we paid for... So disappointing. Took 3 visits and almost 2 hours and still had to pay full price. We will not be returning.",
