I sat down for 25 mins (thank God for technology to keep you busy) before being approached by someone asking if I had been helped. I said no, so instead of getting my drink order he said ok let me go get your server. Fast forward 15 minutes or so and here she is with a no-name introduction and a what can I get you? Well, you could've gotten me a meal 40 mins ago but now I will get a beer and the check. Get the beer in about another 10 mins, no check. Give her card instead, comes back 10 mins later with check and card. Don't go here unless you have a ridiculously long layover or the patience of Buddha. Can't imagine the food being as amazing as the other 3 locations I've been to.",

Enough time to have my entire order ready- apparently I threw the kitchen through a loop because I ordered soup and a burger, but asked for the soup to come out first. I'm weird, I know.   7 more minutes for pseudo club soda, that came with the check.   10 More minutes... She disappeared to apparently make the soup from scratch.  I asked another server to check on the food.   7 more minutes till my server popped back up.  Asked her about the soup.   10 more minutes passed.... I cancelled everything... Because my flight was boarding.  Needless to say... If you want to spend 40 minutes or so with one drink, this is the place for you!

And the reason was that they served it on a shriveled and wrinkled roll, which actually made the roll taste rather stale.  (Picture is on Yelp for the record)  But the rest of the food was good.  That burger would have been pretty good had it been served properly.  And I loved the tater tots with the dipping sauce.    I saw other burgers served that had better rolls.  I don't know why the kitchen chose to give me the runt of the litter.  That's the way it goes I guess.    If I was in the airport again, I'd give them another chance to make up for it.

Our server was very accommodating and I ended up with a tree hugger's salad (extra feta) and a side of tater tots (which I highly recommend with garlic mayo).

They also have Patty alternatives to their normal ones such as Turkey, Black Bean and even American Kobe.  I had the Western burger which came with bacon, onion strings, a spicy cheese that I cannot recall (possibly pepper jack) and BBQ sauce on the side.  I also got the tater tots as my side based on a recommendation from some locals near us.  The tots did not disappoint!

Grease had soaked through the bottom bun and liquified it, so I just ate the patty which was medium rare (I had ordered medium well). The sweet potato fries had probably been made very early that day or the day before. They were cold and stale.

My bartender, who wasn't rude, but wasn't Mr. Personality either, seemed at times to be overworked.  But now that I think about it, did he really need to go get that beer keg in the middle of making my spiked milkshake?  Probably not, but I don't know.    This happened time and time again during my time here.  My black bean burger was tasty, and I loved the consistency, BUT it completely fell apart as soon as I bit into it.  Therefore, I was the freak eating my burger with a fork and knife.  It just didn't taste the same...probably because everyone was staring at me.  The regular French Fries left something to be desired.  Also, I had read in another review that this was fairly inexpensive, that was not the case here.  My spiked shake was $13.00, here I was thinking that it was seven, but no, that was the regular shake with no alcohol.  It was delicious, but not $13.00 delicious.  I am going to stop typing now, because as I write this I am starting to get angry and will change my star rating to one.",

I wasn't sure what to expect as far as their food, and my expectations weren't too high, honestly. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids. Seriously surprised! The burger was perfectly cooked and the bacon was perfect. I was definitely impressed with the burger, I have paid more and not gotten this good of a burger.  Even better than the burger, or at least as equally good, the tater tots. Wow! I love tater tots and these were some of the best I've had. They also have Arnold Palmers, a winner every time. The one complaint I have is that my girlfriend and I both got the wrong order the first time, fries instead of tots and ham - we asked for none. But the waitress was extremely helpful and pleasant. She took care of it right away and even took one of the burgers off the bill! I would definitely eat here again, just wish we had one close to my home.",

Onto the food. I ordered the magic mushroom burger, but got it with chicken instead of red meat. It was really good, especially with the sauce that's on it. I got it with sweet potato fries, which were okay. The two sauces that were served with them made up for the fries just being average. If I'm in the Charlotte airport again for a longer layover, I'd come back. Better than most of the options I passed that were mostly fast food or places that aren't necessarily substantial.",

    "text": "We typically don't care to eat in airport restaurants when we travel because of the high cost and (our experience) lower quality, unless we are absolutely starving.  However, after a nightmare travel day, which wasn't over yet, we really needed food and beer.  We debated where to go, not familiar with anything, and decided a burger bar seemed like the best idea.    First, CLT was insanely packed even at 8pm on a Sunday evening when we were there.  Flights left and right were delayed or cancelled due to weather, so stranded and semi-stranded passengers crowded into every restaurant.  We waited about 10-15 minutes for a table.  It's a cool place, has good ambiance and decor, fun, laid back, good music playing.  Our waiter greeted us promptly, apologizing in advance for any slow service we received, as they were busier than normal.    Only a few beers on tap, and it figured they were out of Goose Island, which is what I wanted.  Oh well, Stella Artois is a great second choice.  He got us our beers in good time.  They have a nice assortment of burgers.  I went plain and simple and it really was delicious.  Cooked fully but not dry.  Excellent fries.  I don't know if it was 12 hours of travel with just airline pretzels in my stomach, or not, but the burger was dang good!  My husband liked his as well.  As you'd expect in an airport, alcohol prices were astronomical.  $10 for a draught beer.  Worth it after the day we'd had, though!  Food prices didn't seem quite as painful, a little better than you might expect at an airport.  Our server was very busy but did a great job keeping friendly, positive, and as attentive as he could be.  I only saw a small handful of servers, and they didn't seem to stop for a second!    Having a positive experience at this place as busy as it was tells me it's probably a good choice anytime.  It'll have its bad moments, sure (there will always be bad days/moments/experiences), but I would eat there again and recommend it to others.",

So yes, a lot of carbs. They were all done well, fried just right to the perfect crisp without being soggy or greasy.  The wings were seasoned well, with plenty of garlic and the perfect amount of salt.  I felt bad for the people sitting next to me on the plane that night though.  With some guilt from all the carbs, I opted for Chicken Club burger instead of beef.  It wasn't that much healthier since it had bacon.  I can't resist bacon.  The burger had a good mix of flavor and was juicy.   It was a decent size, but after the wings and potatoes, I almost couldn't finish it.    Service was friendly and prices were in line with all other airport dining facilities.  I will definitely eat here again the next time I'm at the airport.",

This is a airport restaurant, you would think they would be a little more efficient. The lady working the register was rude and couldn't get the order right. I ordered bell peppers, bacon, cheese, and avocado. I thought she did but when I looked at the receipt well after ordering I noticed it was completely wrong. It had cheese, bacon, and spinach listed. They weren't ingredients I wouldn't/couldn't eat so I decided to just roll with it since it had already been 20 minutes since ordering. When I finally got my food, it wasn't even anything close to what I ordered or what was on the receipt. It was so off I thought it was someone else's order: sausage, peppers, onions, and cheese. The lady seemed mad when I told her this wasn't mine and tried to convince me it was. Only reason for 2 stars was when I had them fix it, it tasted pretty good even though it was still missing items (just bacon and cheese in it!)  Don't go here!",

When it got to me I kept looking poking and wondering if I hadn't been given a soyburger or something. No time to send it back. The tater tots rocked!  Bad Daddy, True!",

Should be yellow. They are sweeter, have more flavor and are smoother (red onions are not smooth).  2. Beef was too lean. Should be no leaner than 85/15.  Makes a burger too dry. 3. Funky pickles. Just use hamburger dills. The pickles here are weirdly spiced. Burgers are supposed to be simple and basic. No need for strange tasting pickles.  Whole wheat bun was outstanding.   The potato chips were very good.  Service was a little slow but about normal for an airport eatery.   The classic rock music was enjoyable in an era where most public music is repetitive and tasteless.",

For lunch/dinner I have had the bacon cheddar burger, I get mine with no bun and a salad instead of the bun and they are very accommodating every single time I ask. I have also had the Stellas Greek salad and the Texican chicken salad, both were good. I like the burger best though honestly.

I ordered at the to-go counter, and got a buzzer that worked all the way up and down C concourse (good range!). It buzzed in about 15 minutes, which is okay, not really fast, so if you're in a hurry, maybe not the best option.  I got the Western Burger with no onions, so it's a buffalo burger, cheese, and barbecue sauce. I got it as close to medium as possible, and I also got chips. The burger was delicious! Juicy and huge! Also it was medium rare, just how I like it. The barbecue sauce was really good. My only complaint would be maybe a bit much cheese, but just nitpicking. The chips were delicious as well.  Overall, give Bad Daddy's a try--it's probably the best restaurant in the airport!",

The order was incorrect and the fries were still frozen in the center. We asked several other employees for help and were told we needed to talk to our server- this is a tiny restaurant so these employees could have easily relayed a message if nothing else. Multiple other tables got up and left due to no one acknowledging them at all after they had to seat themselves (the hostess was too busy openly applying makeup with the takeout window cashier).

Bun was fresh, good grill-ish meat flavor, reasonably tasty veggies on top, good condiments including the onion straw dip. I was surprised, frankly.   The OK: $13 airport money, with tip. Just a burger and fries. Nothing else. Not too cheap, not a great value, but about par for airport food prices of that quality.  The bad: I wanted onion straws, not fries. It took a loooong time, or so it seemed, to get my food - not a good choice for a 1-hour layover unless you like living dangerously. The bartender was not too familiar with Southern hospitality. More of a backwoods-bar bouncer vibe.   Go there, I guess. I'll probably be back if I'm too hungry to make it to my next stop.",

The burger was really good, the avocado topping was fresh, and the sweet potato fries were lovely. Also, alcoholic milkshakes.  Service was not particularly attentive but they also seem understaffed and very busy. We got in and out in about 40 minutes. If there were only outlets/charging stations I would give Bad Daddy's five stars.   (Whose idea was the name Bad Daddy? Smack yourself in the face.)",

Nevertheless, I felt compelled to review them as their food was actually pretty damn tasty. I got the Southern burger with chili, cole slaw, mustard, and relish. Cooked far beyond the medium-rare that I requested, but it was still much better than I had expected. Couldn't even come close to finishing the seemingly bottomless bowl of tater tots, but those were good as well, particularly with the dipping sauce.  Beyond the food, the service was efficient, which is paramount in airport restaurants. No complaints at all. Too bad I don't pass through Charlotte more often.",

It can get crowded (as it is the best spot to kill time), but the wait is worth it by comparison. The service is definitely airport-quality (a.k.a. sub-par). The decor is kinda out-of-the-box, but it's a nice change of pace from what you typically encounter in airports. And there's plenty of TVs if you're into sports or watching the news.",

    "text": "A Midwest transplant, I like to think I know a juicy, high quality burger when it hits my plate. If you're looking for a run of the mill fastfood, double patty burger or a calorie conscious meal, you may stop reading now. Bad Daddy's Burgers is gourmet without being pretentious, the overly generous portions you expect from the south with the deep fried deliciousness that accompanies your soon to be clogged arteries.   This review deserves special recognition because it was officially my first meal as a full-fledged Charlottean. Bad Daddy's kicked off my foodie game and set the bar high.   On my inaugural trip, I was recommended to try the fried pickles as a starter. Keep in mind, these bad boys aren't common up north (read: they don't exist), and I've been known to be mocked by my \"friends\" for drinking pickle juice while inebriated (I hear it cures hangovers?). If I didn't love pickles before, I sure do love them now that they're deep fried. They're just the right amount of tart and sour balanced with the batter that brings back childhood memories at the fair.   I ordered the Bad Ass Burger, because the name sounded cool and also because I couldn't focus on anything else after I read the words, \"buttermilk fried bacon.\" Whoever came up with it, I salute your sheer genius. Biting into that burger is heaven...words can hardly describe how perfect the combination of medium rare meat, bacon with a crunchy fried covering, and horseradish mayo is. Bad. Ass.   Side note: I like to imagine I resembled one of the Carl's Jr commercial models devouring the burger, but that's far from reality. In reality, I ate that burger like there was no tomorrow.  It was just that good.",

It is hard for me to resist getting a milkshake with my burger.  My belt is getting tighter so it won't be as difficult to skip the shake next time.  (Try the Oreo Milkshake!)

The service at Bad Daddy's was somewhat better than Phillip's, but still inadequate for an airport where people only have a certain amount of time before or between flights.  There seemed to be no sense of urgency among the staff, which is unacceptable at an airport.    My patty melt and fries were pretty good.  Nothing special, but decent.  Unfortunately, I had to get it to go and eat it on the airplane because it took too long.    I like to eat close to my departure gate, and I have generally decent experiences at airport restaurants.  I recommend eating at Whiskey River, which is more centrally located in the airport.  They actually seem to CARE that their customers are on a timetable, unlike Big Daddy's and Phillip's.

The best part was the waitress saying that the cook, and I quote, \"is fucking slow.\" Yup, nailed that one on the head.   Here's what happened, probably. My patty melt was done but someone forgot to make my wife's Greek salad. So my burger sat, and sat, and sat. How do I know this? Well, burger was Luke warm and sweet potato fries were cold. Then my wife's salad looked like something thrown together with the aftermath of a Gallegher show. Also is was too spicy for her do to them putting bits of what looked like hand torn peppercinis throughout it. Who the fuck does that? A.) In the history of all things Greek salad a la restaurant those are served whole, on the side, B.) What's with the smash and tear? What happened to the knife skills to chop?   Sadly, I'm boarding my plane so I can't get a refund. Avoid these guys. They suck and don't seem to have their restaurant in order.",

They would not let us make any changes to the side dish. Even though we wanted to pay for the upgrade.( make our plain fries onto their truffle parm fries). The aoli dipping sauce was still good. Then to top it off. I ordered the adult milkshake that I love so much.(last time it was sooooo good). This time there was so little liquor in it that it tasted like a plain, boring VANILLA SHAKE. We asked for something to just make it have more flavor. NOPE!  They will not fix it. Our waitress finally brought me some hersheys syrup, so at least it wasn't just flavorless.

The fries were OK but some had a ton of their seasoning on them which was too salty so I kind of just ate the fries with the least amount of seasoning.  Overall the food served it's purpose and I was no longer hungry but it was not great and I would be perfectly fine going the rest of my life without eating at another one of these restaurants again.",

My omelet was cold that the cheese was hardly melted. I'm pretty sure the \"toast\" was microwaved. I never got my orange juice I ordered but that's a blessing in disguise because my friend got a mimosa and there's no way that was oj. Not to mentioned my omelet was served on paper that then became part of my omelet that I ate and the utensils were plastic. I get it's an airport restaurant but it's a sit down establishment....like come on I've had better meals at gas stations. I now have a terrible chemical taste in my mouth after that horrible meal.

For an airport this is a pretty good burger bar!  The meat was pre formed, but still tasted fresh and was cooked to order.  The bun was very soft and griddled to give it a little texture. I liked the amount of toppings - not too much, but just enough to add some contrast.   The standout was the side of tater tots, they were some of the best I have ever had!   They were addictively crispy and crunchy... finished them before even starting my burger. I dipped them in the Bad Daddy sauce and was in love!   I should have gotten a bottle of the sauce to take home.   The menu includes salads, sandwiches and a bunch of other indulgent foods. I want to try the location outside of the airport as it has a bigger menu and I would like to experiment with the different topping combinations.",

I ordered some kind of scramble with mushrooms and sausage in it, with a side of thick-cut bacon. I also tried to order hot chocolate, but only some coffee was available. They didn't even offer tea. I got the coffee anyways... it was decidedly gross. (It's not that I don't drink coffee, just wasn't in the mood, but I was freezing.)  The breakfast portion was huge, but I really didn't eat most of it. Everything was cold, which was a bit confusing because it came out so fast. The scramble was watery. The toast was not toast at all... just bread. Not warm, not crisp. The potatoes were pretty dry. Bacon was reasonably delish, though.  Still, I guess for a \"sit-down\" breakfast in the Charlotte Airport without having to go out of my way, I'm fairly grateful for Bad Daddy's existence. Just wish it would've been hot.   Service was good, though. Attentive, smiley. Energetic.   It coulda been worse, but I've definitely experienced better-- even in airports.",

While we didn't order any booze on our visit, I do want to point out that this is in an airport so I wouldn't be expecting any happy hour specials. Like with a lot of airport restaurants this place was very busy on a weekend but we had no wait getting a table. I was pleasantly surprised with how good the food was. Both the buffalo chicken sandwich and turkey burger were really good. I mean they were regular restaurant really good, not just an airport restaurant really good. While I enjoyed our meal, the main reason for the 5-star rating is the service. Our waitress Aubrey was one of the nicest people I have ever met. I even made a comment to the lady that I wish every day that I was as happy as Aubrey was. She had a great personality, checked on us just the right amount, and was extremely polite. I could see how someone who works in a busy restaurant in a busy airport could get frustrated and crabby, but it apparently doesn't have an effect on her.

So we both opted to get a beer and shot deal for $10. Not bad too bad.    Next in line was the food. The burgers looked good and also backed by a few other reviews. I went with the 'breakfast' burger but can't remember the exact name. After we placed our orders we noticed the placed started to fill up, quick. We got their just in time before a huge rush.   The food arrived about 20 mins later and was great. I ordered my burger well done so the wait was expected. It came between two hot buns, topped with melted cheese, two slices of bacon, and an over easy made egg on top. The fries came well seasoned too. This is just how I wanted my meal, a well cooked burger with runny egg yoke.   After we ate it did take a while for our check to arrive and pay. At this point all the staff was busy and you could see the frustration in the other customers faces. My review could of easily been on the downside had I arrived later and still chosen to eat here.

    "text": "After checking out the food court and passing on the normal trash good offerings we found this place, a sit down restaurant, that had promise.  The service was fast and friendly and we didn't feel overly ripped off by  the airport prices.  The setting was cute, seating comfortable.      Music was fantastic for someone my age, assuming I was drinking a half dozen beers and wanted to really enjoy myself for the night.   However, between encapsulation in flying canisters we were looking for quiet, relaxing. I have to feel that \"Iron Butterfly\" type music, the softest being  CCNY played loud, were played, not for enjoyment but to get my heart pumping do I'd eat fast and clear the table for the next flyer.        Food was somewhat limited, obviously mostly burgers.  We would have liked a late breakfast.  We both had grilled chicken on whole wheat rolls with fries. Meat portion small, roll portion quite large and mealy. We both took the meat out and ate it with a knife and fork. Fried were fine, not great.  All in all, service quick, friendly, prices fair, food just adequate.          We will be passing through the airport next week and will lunch at Sabarro next for.  Always good.  You always know what you're getting.",

The highlight was my waitress who was very conscious of people's need to make their flights, so started her service by asking how quickly I needed to run. I was deep into a book, so she was so polite and tried as much as possible not to disturb me. I ordered the club with tater tots on the side. The club was big and full of thick cuts of chicken, ham and bacon. The tater tots were just out of the fryer and came with a great chipotle dipping sauce. The prices were very reasonable for the airport, and the location was right next to my connecting AA flights.",

The choices that early in the morning were limited and Bad Daddy's had just opened. I ordered a coffee and their breakfast platter.  All over it was terrible.  The coffee was super strong with grounds in the bottom.  I was never offered a refill (and wouldn't have taken it any way).  I'm not sure how you can screw up breakfast food but it was bad.  The rye toast had --maybe -- a slight tan -- it certainly wasn't toasted.  They gave me grape jelly and frozen butter but threw it on the plate in the middle of the eggs.  The only decent part was the sausage.  Even the eggs tasted burnt and oily on the bottom.  Avoid (at all costs) for breakfast.  Trust me!!",

I want to say the greeters were friendly, but they were carrying on a conversation and we waited about 30 seconds to be acknowledged, Once acknowledged, we were finally sat. The place was HOPPING! Busy, and I guess that's to be expected. The burger selection is huge - as to be expected from a Burger Bar. And the food is tasty. I had a make your own burger - with tots.

The burgers were not good at all.  I ordered the western and my husband ordered a custom burger.  His was barely edible.  The staff seemed very unhappy to be at work.  There was trash and food on the floor.  The fries and tater tots are also very unmemorable.  We ended up wishing we'd eaten at McDonald's.  Will not go back.",

Cold shock top on draft with tasty fried pickles was a great way to start the meal.  My wife had their bean burger which she said was very good. I had the burger with pastrami and it was delicious.  Pastrami was nice and thin which provided for great flavor and did not overwhelm the burger. The burger itself was tasty with good flavor.  I like it was seasoned as most burger joints leave it all to the toppings. We both had tater tots which were okay.  They could have been better as it appeared that the grease was due for a change out.  Overall this was a great experience, especially for airport food.",

We had already had lunch so we were looking for a place where we could watch a game, drink a beer and chill for a couple of hours. We ordered the sweet potato fries and they might have been the most delicious sweet potato fries I have ever tried. They were crispy and thin, but still had enough of a gooey center to keep me going back. The dipping sauce was a good compliment also. I am sure that the rest of their menu was just as well executed, and the options listed were extensive and sounded amazing. The server was not bothered at all by us occupying his table for two hours while not ordering much more than a couple of beers. The decor was cool, the walls were covered in TVs and there was a large window overlooking the tarmac.  The space offered tables as well as places for solo diners to eat. All in all, this place offered an excellent option for airport dining.",

We only had 50 or so minutes to eat and get to our gate, so we booked it to Bad Daddy's. It was packed, but the hostess got us seated and we ordered our food relatively quickly. It took a while for the food to come and the check (we waited about 30 minutes for our food), but all was forgiven when we bit into our delicious burgers.  I ordered the Magic Mushroom burger and it was great. It was perfectly cooked and the truffle aioli simply made it! I had some house made potato chips on the side, which were pretty good, but the sweet potato fries really stole the show. The next time I get a layover in Charlotte, I know where I'm going for lunch!",

It still ended up being wrong but after ordering and waiting 20 minutes for my food I had just enough time to rush over to my flight and didn't notice until it was too late.

    "text": "I found myself in Bad Daddy's when looking for a place to sit down and eat in relative peace in Terminal B on a day when every other flight was cancelling or getting delayed. After a 15-min wait due to the crowds, I was seated along the window. I immediately noticed and liked the push-button server call systems they had, which made it ways to summon someone to order or pay. These are common in Korea and it was such a surprise to see something similar at an airport burger joint in Charlotte!  I ordered the southwestern salad. The strange thing is that one of the servers kept coming out of the kitchen with random dishes and asking every single person along the window if it was theirs...which it wasn't. By the third dish, I was wondering if she was just grabbing plates and walking out (mind you, this place is packed and possibly one of the most spacious eateries at CLT) randomly. Anyway, my salad eventually came out and it was pretty solid. I had asked for red onion and there was tons of red onion in it, but it was otherwise a good choice, and the chicken was tender.   When the check came, it had another salad on it, and the waitress said she had mixed my bill up with that of someone who had ordered the Asian salad but that they were the same price. I went about my business and paid the bill.   Beaudevin is my #1 spot at CLT, but I would come back here.",

I have been eating at Big Daddy's for around 10 years - at the locations in South end & Ballantyne, and then when they opened in the airport & changed name from Big Daddy's to Bad Daddy's.  I used to tell people that it was the best food in the airport (yes I know, not a lot of competition for good food here) - and it made their bad service worth putting up with.   Now, the service is horrible & the food is too. I HONESTLY wish I would have just gone to Burger King at the food court. It would have been better than this!   This location has been steadily going down hill, but I kept giving it more chances because of how much I like their burgers elsewhere. Well now it's just so bad that my high schools cafeteria had better burgers back in 1990. I think I've been to roadside rest stop type fast food places with better food.   The HORRIBLE service and equally HORRIBLE food here should warrant the chain shutting down this location, since it's completely tainting their reputation everywhere.",

It was simple and Bland but well enough cooked. My omelette was straightforward, and the bread even was pretty much as generic as you can make something.

My burger was thin, dry, and cooked extremely well done, when I'd requested medium. The price is also steep for what you get - my burger, fries, and Diet Coke cost me $21.00. Next time I'd probably go to a fast food spot in the airport and spend 1/2 the price for similar food and likely better service. My waitress was friendly, just very slow.",

I did like the fact that they had gluten free options and I think - not sure - there was a separate GF prep area. (If you're really sensitive to cross-contamination this would be a good question to ask.)  The house sauce was kind of quirky but interesting for dipping the fries in. Ketchup and mustard were on the table. Hubby had a turkey patty brie melt said it was good. Son had a burger and fries. Straightforward. I had a burger with no bun and requested extra lettuce leaves to wrap it in but I don't think it translated to the server that way as I received a lot of extra chopped lettuce.   All in all, if you're in between flights and can get in, it's an OK place to stop and probably offers choices that are a little better than others on concourse B.",

Their rye bread tasted like cleaning solution, was partially toasted, and had the consistency of styrofoam. The sausage patties were dry, over cooked, and also had an odd flavor.

Don't let big companies (HMS Host in this case) try to create and execute cool concepts - it doesn't work.  My $14 burger (+ $1.99 to add a sad salad instead of fries) was ok at best - and while I'll always take something under cooked as opposed to over cooked,  my medium rare was almost raw in the middle - and still cool! Lastly,  they served my bunless burger in what looked like a dog bowl - which made it difficult to cut and eat.  All in all - meh at best. Sorry,  Bad Daddy - I think you're just bad.",

The Frenchie has such promise: a very salty turkey patty covered in oozing brie, sliced apples, applewood smoked bacon, garlic mayo and the phone number of a local cardiologist. This is supposed to feel healthier, ain't it? The flavors work, remarkably well, and I wolfed down the 'wich faster than Albert Camus' literary protagonist's descent in to madness. (L'Etranger reference +1)  Three cheers for the slaw, which held a hefty dose of caraway seed (?) and a proper crunch. One cheer for noticing the seeds in the apple slices before taking a bite -- there were a bunch. Service was on point at first, then steadily waned as the meal progressed. Had to chase down the server for a check.   I'd order the Frenchie again, but wouldn't necessarily clear a path to Bad Daddy's. Then again, it's an airport, and A-OK may be tough to come by.",

The menu is pretty much the same as the regular Bad Daddy's locations, but I did notice some missing items (which was expected for a satellite airport location).  Not as many varieties of delicious burgers, but you can definitely still find something to eat here.  The hostess... was a bit tired, you could tell by the way she was slumped over the greeter's podium when I walked up.  She looked at me like \"what are you here for...\" and definitely did not start my experience on a good foot.  Eventually she figured out that I was there to eat and I just needed a table for 1 (after I told her)... most of the tables were filled up so I sat at the window where they have a ledge and bar stools for singles (smart set up for airports).  What the hostess lacked, my server made up for it by being friendly and prompt.  I got my black bean burger and tots... and most importantly my beer.  They didn't have much on tap, but they had bottles as well.  Burger was just as good as any of the other locations with the tots nice and crisp.  Airport prices here, but I still thought it was worth it once I got over the bad start to my lunch experience.",

Even though it's not the best or most gourmet burger you'll ever have, it's definitely better than any fast food you'll find anywhere, let alone any burger you'll find in an airport.  There's a bunch of options on the menu for everyone's different tastes, and honestly even if you don't like any of them, the menu also has a section where you can make your own custom burger from a list of something like 30 different ingredients.  Thoughtful for even the pickiest of eaters!  If you're worried about time - I'd say it's probably nothing worth fretting over.  My friend and I were easily out within 45 mins from sitting down and placing our order to finishing our last bites and paying the bill.  The staff clearly seem to know sometimes there can be a bit of a rush, so they're happy to hurry you out when you need to run to catch your plane, but at the same time, they're happy to let you take your time as well if you have a longer wait or layover.  Overall, a really solid establishment.  I would definitely be back if only for the thoughtfulness of the staff that work there!",

The waitress took a bit longer than normal, but I had a long layover so it wasn't a huge deal. Once she took my order, The burger came out in a reasonable amount of time, however it was over cooked as I had requested medium rare and it came out medium well. I asked her if she could take the party to have it cooked properly. She very politely obliged and actually brought me out an entirely new meal. This time the party came out medium and I was happy to accept it that way, because I think the issue is that the party is not super thick and was probably frozen before hand, so health safety wise, the cook may not have been able to achieve medium rare properly. Over all the burger tastes fine, it was seasoned properly and big enough that with the fries, I only ate half and took the rest to go. The sweet potato fries were fine too; not the best I've ever had, but not bad by any means. The cookies and cream milkshake was not good. The liquid to ice cream to cookie ratio was way off. It had a very thin consistency and was not blended very well. There were huge chunks of cookie clumped together in the bottom and there definitely was not enough ice cream in the blending process. Overall, this place is pretty on par with other airport food. It wasn't fantastic, but I've had worse and my server was very nice and friendly.",

My burger was cooked just as I had asked. My boyfriend ordered the bacon cheeseburger on steroids. Yes, that's what it's really called. This would probably be a must for any bacon lover. Why?

The waiter took over 10 minutes to come over to take our order. A patron several tables down was waiting so long for his food he took fries off another table that has left.

The Bacon Cheeseburger was excellent!  But why give it 3 stars?!?! Even though the food came out quickly, someway, somehow, the food was COLD. I have no idea why but it was cold.  Due to the short layover time and just cannot missed the next flight, I downed it like a champ!  The bun was cold along with the cold fixins' didn't help either.  But the first thing I put in my mouth was the side of sweet potato fries...first bite...dissapointment...again...It was COLD.    The burger had everything a burger enthusiast wants.  Meat, bacon, cheese, more bacon, and the regular fixins,' oh, and MORE bacon...6 slices to be exact!  I added an overeasy egg and some avocado to top it off.  The combinations of flavors were good and the meat patty was cooked to order, not any rarer or well done.     Sweet potato fries were seasoned nicely and came with a side dip of chipotle ranch.    It actually is a decent place to eat and the portions are excellent for an airport establishment.  Hope the next time I give it another chance and the food comes out a bit warmer...",

    "text": "I am a burger aficionado. When I saw Bad Daddy's in the airport and not being from the area, I was immediately intrigued and had to try it.  My favorite burger chain is Five Guys. They are the gold standard for chain hamburgers in my opinion. Please keep in mind this review is for the Bad Daddy's burger only. I have no opinion on anything else. The service, the sides, etc.  I ordred the 'basic burger'. It's a single patty and comes with leafy green lettuce, tomato and onion on a standard white bun. I added american cheese. I figured this was the best option to get an idea of whether these guys are for real or not.  Standing at the take out window (cute as it's in the airport) the smell of caramelized beef wafted out of the kitchen. This encouraged me. That's the same smell that engulfs one upon a visit to the burger mecca, Five Guys.  Although the restaurant was very busy the burger arrived in a short 7 minutes.  I'll cut to the chase and spill the beans... Five Guys has nothing to worry about.   A great hamburger is all about the beef and this is where Bad Daddy's fell short. I ordered it cooked medium. It did indeed arrive medium. But the patty had little flavor. This despite having a nice caramelized crust on both sides. On top of having no flavor, it was also a tad chewy. Bad Daddy's claims to use a \"custom\" fresh ground beef blend. They could've fooled me. The burger tasted of frozen, low quality beef to my finely tuned taste buds.   I did like the bun, cheese, lettuce, and thick slice of tomato. But it wasn't enough to save the lackluster patty.  So, to sum up: The Bad Daddy's burger is ok, and will do in a pinch. But if you are looking for burger nirvana, look elsewhere.",

The hostesses were giggling and did not seem to care much about customer service. They did not make much eye contact or smile, and seemed to have a bit of an attitude.  When I was sat down, took another 5-10 minutes for my server to take my order. I ordered the frenchie (turkey burger). It took another 15-20 minutes to come out. The food was pretty good, but the wait time was way too long (especially for an airport). My server did not come check on me, so I had to get up and grab some silverware myself. My check took another 5-10 minutes after I requested it while eating.  While eating, I noticed probably 80% of the servers did not look happy at all. Not a typical \"stressed-cause-it's-busy\" look, but really a \"I-hate-this-place\" look. Does not make a pleasant atmosphere when everyone has attitude.  The tables were also crammed very close to each other. The atmosphere overall was really, even for an airport. Very loud in there.  I would not return. It is 2 stars and not 1 because I usually just give 1 star if the food is inedible...and the actual food was pretty good, although messy.",

Being that our flight out was almost at 11:00pm, we thought it best to have a proper dinner to both occupy our time and give us one less thing to do once we landed in Newark well after midnight.  On this evening, several flights into the NYC-area were cancelled so folks were either stranded or themselves killing a lot of time. That may have had something to do with this place being jampacked so late in the evening. The greeter told me it would be around 15-20 minutes before they could seat our party of seven. Right on schedule, we were seated and had ample time to survey the menu and take our time eating before our flight began boarding.   I ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with tater tots and both were pretty delicious, cooked to perfection, and satisfying. The sandwich was tangy but not very spicy (which I was okay with), attractively assembled, and didn't fall apart when I ate it. I really liked the blue cheese crumbles which added a zesty kick to the sandwich. The tots were crispy and not too oily, and they gave me a pretty big portion which I shared with my son.   My son ordered the Garlic Wings for his meal and he, too, got a nice sized order. The menu said \"1 lb\" and it certainly seemed to be close to that.  My only complaint was that we had a hard time tracking down our server as we wound down our meal. In fact, she really didn't even drop back by after our food was brought out, to check and see if everything was copacetic. Since it was super busy, I guess I can understand.  Prices were not exorbitant for an airport restaurant of this quality. I'd not hesitate to drop in again if I'm at CLT Airport's Concourse C.",

I will say they do run out of things at times but for Airport food the burgers are top notch. The cheese burger on steroids with no bun is a Keto persons dream!  Even though it is standing room only and you may have to wait for a table service is good and food is HOT.  Stop in and have a good burger. Tell'em Louie sent ya. It won't won't get ya a discount just see what they say!!",

    "text": "Hungry and killing some time on a layover in Terminal C, I decided to set up shop at Bad Daddy's Burger Bar. There was only bar stool seating facing the terminal initially, then someone moved and we made a beeline for the two-top that opened up. This place is seat yourself, and you can order takeout at a side window that faces the terminal. I didn't really notice if servers were in any particular section, but the server that took my order, was different from the one who delivered my food, and it was pretty seamless. I opted for the bacon burger no bun, with sweet potato fries. They do a nice set up without the bun making sure all condiments on the menu description are included. I often find many places just leave off and forget mayo or a sauce since they don't know what to do without the bun, but Bad Daddy's gets it right! Just because I don't want the bun, doesn't mean I don't want the other burger accompaniments.   On to the burger. It was perfectly cooked and juicy. My cheese was melted... please do not ever bring me cold cheese. The jalapeno bacon was spicy and crisp...but not too crisp to where it disintegrated, and the bacon mayo was so good! Bacon burger indeed. Two types of bacon and bacon mayo. It was a bit indulgent, but we weren't ready to finish our long weekend quite yet. Ha! You can definitely split this and I did not try the sweet potato fries, but my boo thought they were delicious!",

If you like a bartender that says no and makes you question who the customer is.. then yes, this is the place for you.   If it wasn't for the one younger male bartender with a beard I would not even write about this airport dive bar/eatery. It's like a scene out of Animal House where people throw bottles and anything at the performing Blues Brothers... just there's zero talent here.   The place is pricey for airport drinks and when it comes with the female OCD bartender then it's even more costly. I just don't get it. If I order Medium rare, don't tell me no...The bacon was cooked so early in the morning for prep that when I got it, it still had the congealed fat on it. one on, warm it up for crying out loud.

There are the obvious protein offerings like hamburgers but they also have turkey burgers and chicken. The sides are not very #ketofriendly as they are all some form of potato but we were able to swap it out for a nicely portioned side salad. The next time I'm in a stand-alone Bad Daddies I'll do a more in depth review but if you stick to salads with clean protein (no sauces or batter) or bunless meat options you should be ok. We did try the Crispy Garlic Wings but I tasted some sweetness in the dry rub so I'd steer clear to be on the safe side.   Things I didn't like include a $3.49 charge for soda water. Like seriously? And we waited a little longer for refills and food to come out but they were busy so I get it.",

I usually don't expect much from airport food, but I have to admit that my omelette pretty good. I ordered my food to-go, it took about 7-10 minutes which was nice. The cashier that took my order was very friendly and went over the details of my order to make sure that he got it right, which I really appreciated. I enjoyed this place a lot, would like to try them again for a burger next time I'm in the Charlotte airport! I would definitely recommend them.  Update: As I stated above, next time I was in the Charlotte airport I would return to this establishment.  I did return, and was excited about having the same meal as before.  Unfortunately the cashier informed they could not accommodate my request to substitute potato's/toast (I cannot have either due to dietary restrictions) for sweet potato fries.  Also the cashier just didn't seem interested in helping me out much.  So unfortunately I had to eat at another restaurant and will not be returning to Big Daddy's.",

    "text": "My wife and two daughters had a layover in Charlotte on our way back from the Caribbean. We couldn't have been more relaxed than when we landed in Charlotte and were reminiscing about the best parts of our trip. We didn't even mind the 40-minute wait between ordering and when our food arrived (also, the length of time from when we ordered and when we saw our waitress, Lauryn, again). While others arrived after us and were served before us, we continued chatting up to the point that we started to get nervous about missing our connecting flight. We noticed a few other patrons getting vocal about the wait, and some walked out as a result.  It was then that our meal arrived. We should've already been questioning things, as the waitress never asked how the burgers were to be prepared or to clarify toppings when the menu gave options. Unfortunately, the first issue was that there was hair in the salad dressing container on my plate, which I quickly flagged down the waitress to tell her. (I used to get freaked over hair, but truth is, it happens and if an isolated experience, wouldn't make a big deal about it). She took the container and then I pointed out that about half the ingredients from my salad were missing, such as the red bell peppers. Still without an apology, she asked what else was missing. That's when I started to lose it. I neither had the menu in front of me, nor the full memory about each item in the salad. I told her that it's not my job to ensure the order is correct and to please take the entire item away, both the hairy dressing and half-empty salad. She then started arguing with me. I told her she should ask her manager for more training as she clearly doesn't know how to handle customer interactions.  She did seek out the manager and from a distance, I believe recounted what she perceived took place. The manager came to the table and handed me my check, asking if I was ready to pay (no apology, no question about what transpired). I said I am ready to do whatever is necessary to get out of the restaurant as quickly as possible, but went on to explain what took place and how key steps in the process (checking to see if we needed anything, assuring us the food would be there soon, apologizing for the delay, fixing the order issue without debate) should be basic training for the employees. I showed her the bill where it had all burgers listed as being ordered well done. (What animals would order meat well done?!) I grabbed a menu and pointed out the five ingredients missing from my salad. I let her know I came in relaxed and ready for a meal and left starving and aggravated. Then, she apologized and I said it was no problem, as things happen. (There it was -- too late, but not missing altogether: an apology. A recognition that something wasn't handled properly. That's all it would've taken to defuse the situation.)  Maybe Lauryn was having a terrible day. Maybe other things happened at the restaurant that were out of her control. Maybe she is a horrible waitress, but hasn't found her passion in life yet. Whatever the cause, I'd avoid this place in the future. As a general rule, I think I'll go ahead and avoid any restaurant with the word 'bad' in the name.   I will note at the end, the manager did take some items off the bill and reduced the overall price to under half, though most of the items were either wrong or returned so it was the least she could've done.",

    "text": "I love me a good burger joint where there is a roll of paper towels at your table ready to clean those hands from the lovely juices that flow from a juicy burger.   Bad Daddy's is located in Terminal C of the Charlotte Airport. It's a small spot, but they tightly fit about 50 or so people at a table, raised table, booth or bar. During sports its difficult to find a seat since most tend to hang out and continue drinking beers after completing their dinner.  I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids which had Monterey Jack cheese (which I left off because I can't eat cheese), three pieces of jalapeno bacon, three pieces of applewood smoked bacon, housemade bacon mayo (actual bacon pieces in it), shredded iceberg lettuce, tomato, red onion and pickles. I requested a medium cook, to which the chef nailed, and it came nicely wrapped in a burger diaper with a side of sweet potato fries. The jalapeno bacon had a nice kick to it, but trust me with 6 slices of bacon it was piled high and delicious. I like my bacon crunchy and they achieved that with each bite. I washed it all down with a pint of beer and left there a very happy person.  If you are a burger lovey, you would love this place as those around me really enjoyed their burgers and some even had the buffalo wings. I did not, but heard they were good.",

If you eat here, you either:  A) Are starving B) Need to soak up the alcohol you're consuming at the bar C) Only have five minutes to grab a bite to eat (this isn't the place for you) D) Need to get takeout fast to take on the plane with you to stink the whole damn plane up (don't do that, it's rude and this isn't the place for you) E) Don't have enough time or wherewithal to walk half the concourse to the food court where there are better options  So if you find yourself in situation A, B or E; this is a perfectly average burger place with a bar.  Positive:  Eclectic topping choices.  I had a burger with brie cheese and Kalamata olives. Positive:  Local beer - try something new.  Negative:  The patty just wasn't very tasty.

I asked for my burger medium rare.  They burnt it on the outside and the inside was medium.  My daughter order a burger on Texas toast.  The toast was burnt, her tater tots were a cold greasy mess and the burger was cold too.  My wife got a salad with chicken.  The chicken was cold and best of all, I'm guessing the waitress must have thought my wife's hands were a fork and knife cause we had to flag down 2 waitresses to bring us silverware.  Like I said, outside of the Sam Adams, the meal was awful.  They really do a dis-service to the other locations.  There have to be better options at CLT for food.  I would avoid this place unless you just want a beer.",

I've been here a handful of times and used to rave about it but something has changed the last couple visits.  The meat isn't as hearty, the fries aren't as crispy, the shakes aren't as creamy.  I don't know...just overall a couple notches down in terms of quality.  I tried the mamma ricotta burger this weekend and the pesto sauce was good, the mozzarella was good but the burger itself was weak.  Even the tomatoes were weak!  They were supposed to be roma and they were not!  But back to the burger...it was limp, it was super bright pink on the inside and it was about as thick as a McDonald's burger.  What the heck happened?  It was juicy in some regards but it was also more so dripping grease than flavor.  Others at my table tried the turkey burger and just a classic burger and they seemed to enjoy their choices just fine.  The fries are small, stringy and greasy so nothing special there...the sweet potato fries are pretty good but that's to be expected.  We ordered the banana pudding and a peanut butter and chocolate milkshake for the table and they were okay but not amazing.  I personally thoroughly enjoyed the banana pudding but others felt it was too sweet.  The milkshake was just boring and too frozen.  It was like ice cream served in a glass.  I couldn't taste the peanut butter in it.    Overall, it just was not that impressive.  The servers were friendly and the atmosphere is fun as always but I just think the quality was suffering for this visit.  I could be persuaded otherwise but giving them a break for now.",

We ordered the texican chicken salad (lettuce, fried chicken, cilantro, onion, tomato, black beans, tortilla strips & corn with chipotle ranch dressing) and the fried pickles. The salad was bland and the lackluster dressing hardly added anything to it. In stark contrast, the fried pickles were SO salty, I couldn't finish them. Seriously, this may have been the saltiest food I've ever had. If the U.S. suddenly institutes a draft and you need to evade it, grab an order of these for a severe spike in your blood pressure. Otherwise, there is no reason to order these. We did have some pretty good local beer - I tried the Noda Jam Session, which was a pale ale with strong hops and a pretty cool hipstery can. Beer aside, I left here a sad daddy.* =(  *Admittedly I am no one's father, but I was still sad.",

    "text": "Stopped in here for a late lunch before our flight out for the holiday. Big mistake. We were seated close to 1:30, which gave us over an hour before our flight was scheduled to begin boarding. Waitress arrives at our table 10 minutes later. We order 2 sodas and a lemonade for the mini. 5 minutes later the drinks are brought to the table and we both order burgers and a hot dog for Junior. Waitress says it shouldn't take very long. She leaves, I try my soda, it smells and tastes funny. Now, working in the industry myself, I know what the smell is. It's the flavor of tea that is dispensed through a bag-in-box system like sodas are. Disgusting. When our waitress reappears 10 minutes later, I explain the problem, she offers to bring us bottled sodas and says our food will be ready shortly. She returns with bottled sodas 5 minutes later. By now it's 2pm and I'm starting to worry about being able to eat before our flight. Waitress says our food will be right out. 10 minutes later she says the same thing. 10 minutes later we ask another waitress to have our food packed up to go since out waitress has disappeared again. 5 minutes later, part of our order comes to the table, and we are told that my burger will be just a minute. Wife's burger is already cold when brought to the table. 5 minutes later my burger arrives, the side of tater tots is ice cold. 5 minutes later our waitress finally arrives with our check, at which time I informed her of the shoddy quality of the food. She got a manager to comp the check, which was nice because by the time we boarded our flight the food was 100% inedible. Oh, and while we were rushing out of the restaurant to make our flight, I observed the expo scratching his beard with an ungloved hand right before pulling a plate out of the window.   I think this place needs a name change, Yeah they have a bar, and the owner is probably someone's father, but it would be far more accurate to drop those words and just call the joint Bad Burger.",

Agreed with another reviewer that for people with bags there are far too many tables. It seems like a busy place with decent drinks/food but service is very lacking. No leadership is visible whatsoever.   Decided on some tater tots with chili after the menu didn't explode at me, and you can't screw up tater tots. Or chili. Very average fare.   Prices were high for drinks but that is to be expected at the airport. Not a bad experience but certainly not a good one.

I haven't been back to Chilis Too or Taquileria since this place opened.  I get the popeye for breakfast and have a good start to my trip.    To go service was slow a couple times when I used it.  I had 15 minutes before I was boarding at the gate next door and got my food with about 2 minutes to spare.  It was hot and fresh, but still seemed to take longer than an omelet should.

By nature, airports offer incredibly expensive food and drinks, so I wasn't necessarily surprised by the cost--but I guess I expected it to be better given the crowd that was inside.   I can't remember what it was called, but I ordered a burger with jalapeno bacon and pepperjack cheese, and it would have been tastier if the bottom bun wasn't soaked with grease and terribly soggy. My order of french fries were 60% french fries, and 40% tater tots. Lazy cook!   For two burgers, it was more than $32.00. I guess they're not at risk of going anywhere anytime soon though because that's kind of the standard in an airport. In the real world, I don't think the novelty environment would allow them to survive beyond the quality of the food. Again, wasn't awful, but the few things they blew it with were just enough to kill the overall experience for us. Could be much better with just a little bit more attention to detail!",

    "text": "The line for this Bad Daddy's Burger Bar (in Concourse C at CLT) is ridiculous. With a long wait list, the guy I was standing next to in line was willing to share a table with me and another dude just so we could sit down and eat. In the end, I waited about 30 minutes for my own table (which I'm not complaining about).  FOOD & DRINK: Corona with Lime: Really, a lukewarm Corona!? Had I known there weren't any chilled, I would've opted for something else.  Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids with Fries: Good. On a thick burger patty is three pieces of jalapeno bacon, three pieces of applewood smoked bacon, Baconnaise, Monterey Jack cheese, shredded lettuce, tomato, red onions, and pickles. I'm glad my burger came with extra Baconnaise on the side; it wasn't overly dry, but definitely tasted better with extra sauce. The fries were fresh from the fryer. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium rare, but it was unfortunately served well done.   SERVICE: Brandy is great! She was very friendly and made sure I had everything I needed. The hostess' were nice as well, along with the other staff here. Food took about 20 minutes to be served, which was quicker than I thought considering the crowd.  I was leaning towards leaving a 3-star rating, but all things considered, this was probably one of the better restaurants I've eaten at in an airport. I would certainly consider eating here again during a long layover at CLT.",

I ordered the grilled chicken salad, not sure if was intended to be served cold but it was.   Giving them props for what ever sauce they served with the tots my wife got.  It tasked like bacon goodness and the only real eatable part of the entire meal.  Latter on in the evening I got terribly sick, bad daddy's was the only thing I ate up to that point.  Massive headache and projectile vomit, my guess is it was the chicken in the salad.  I'd stay clear of this place, very slow service, and the food is not worth the wait.

I decided to try the bacon burger with the tots. My food came out in a reasonable time, but I had no silverware and the waitress forgot my drink as well. The burger was good. It was good, but I'd have to say the highlight of my meal was the tater tots. I know it's an airport restaurant, but thought the service was pretty terrible for the crowd that they had.

As is expected in the airport, the food typically comes out pretty quickly. Also as expected, they're big into pushing the upcharge for an extra shot or an extra large drink.

    "text": "What a great find in the airport! I'm always looking to try local food and was happy to find this gem. Bad Daddy is one of North Carolina's chain restaurants but let me tell you, there's nothing fast food or \"chainy\" about this place. It feels like a restaurant and the service was fantastic.   Bad Daddy's is located in Concourse C by gate C6. Unlike many airports where the concourses can be miles away CLT is much easier to navigate so getting to Bad Daddy's in a timely manner is not a problem. There's ample seating - tables, bar, and window seating.   I ordered their specialty burger- Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids - it's exactly what you think it is - humongous and gluttonous goodness. This burger has 6, yes 6, strips of bacon (half are applewood smoked and other half are jalapeno bacon), cheese, all the fixings, and their \"baconnaise\" sauce which is a mixture of smokiness and a hint of spiciness (with a mayo texture). Although I can't really do spicy, I threw that stuff on because it tasted really good.  The fries were ho hum but that's fine by me as I was there for the burger. I saw a bunch of other items on the menu that looked really good like the \"spiked shakes\" (adult shakes with alcohol). The mudslide, creamsicle, and Bailey's dream looked delish!   Great experience here and the food is solid. Thank you to Tiana, who was super friendly and attentive (and got me out of there with enough time to casually stroll back to my gate). Thanks!!!",

They left off the mayo and bacon. When I finally tracked down the waitress she went and got me about. 1/2 pound of cooked bacon. By then the food was pretty cool and I certainly don't need that much. The mayo never materialized.  All that said the turkey patty was well Seasoned and the mushrooms were great. Even the late to arrive bacon was hot and crispy.

This place was packed, couldn't get a seat at the bar but the hostess got me seated really quick. Service is on point and quick as well without feeling rushed but If you have a flight to catch they will get you in and out.   I started with the enchilada soup, this is the best complaint I can ever give... It was so flipping hot I had to wait for a bit to eat it, and that alone made me smile.. I was starving and did wish a was a bit cooler but holy cow, no one will ever whine about cold soup here.   I opted for the mama (rosa)? burger. Fresh mozzarella and olive oil with a pepper and tomato. It was cooked to perfection.. One one gripe is it did sit in the windo for a minute so the juice made the bun soggy. I'll ask for a grilled bun next time. I do eat my burgers MR so there was definitely blood in the bun... The favors were awesome and again, server on point making sure everything was great.  So final result, Charlotte airport found a winner!!",

I got the Popeyes scramble, which was eggs mixed with spinach, mushrooms and feta. The scrambled eggs were overcooked (they had a dark brown crust), there was approximately 1/2 piece of spinach in the entire dish, and the feta tasted off, not delicious at all. The sides were subpar as well. The toast was simultaneously burnt and cold/doughy (very strange) and the potatoes were meh. Wish I could have gotten fruit but they were out.   I know we are at the airport, but my breakfast was pretty much inedible. If you are stuck here in the AM, I would recommend the omelette, that's what the husband ordered and he found it quite tasty.",

Such an impasse is one which I reached upon my arrival at the Charlotte Douglas Airport Bad Daddy's Burger Bar.  Having heard nothing but glowing recommendations from friends and family, I was enthused upon discovering a location just by my gate.      Sadly, not only did a 15 minute takeout wait stretch to 35 minutes, I was forced to become the needy customer I loathe in my years of restaurant experience or miss my flight.  I chose the former. I nearly hopped into the kitchen myself to get a lackluster Western burger.  The staff seemed apathetic to the situation, but graciously gave me the wrong dressing, cheese, and a cold side.    I must applaud them on the worst burger experience in my almost three decades of pumping sweet red meat into my body.",

The bartender was great and they had a few good beers on tap. I went with a Blue Moon with an orange.  The menu is mostly burgers but they do have salads, appetizers and a few other sandwiches. I went with a burger with cheese and all the fixings and a side salad with blue cheese dressing instead of fries. Of course there is an up charge for this which I hate but a great healthy alternative.  The burger was decent and the salad was pretty good-at first they told me they were out of blue cheese and had ranch. That was fine but then they were out of ranch and had blue cheese. Again the place is always busy so I am glad they got our orders right.  They also have tator tots instead of regular fries which is a nice option.  The food was served in an average amount of time so keep that into consideration if you are looking for something quick before a flight.",

    "text": "On our way back to Philly from Michigan, the GF and I had a layover at Charlotte Douglas International in North Carolina. We were also in the mood for burgers so decided to check out Bad Daddy's Burger Bar.  Cookies n Cream Spiked Milkshake [$13.49] Vodka, Kahlua, Baileys, Oreo cookies  We decided to share one of the spiked milkshakes, which was a creamy mix of Oreo cookies and Kahlua and Baileys which always goes well together. You could get a faint whiff of the vodka, but the cookies and cream was definitely at the forefront. Not bad at all.  Fried Pickles [$8.29] Sliced dill pickles, lightly breaded, ranch dressing  And if fried pickles are on the menu, it's probably going to be ordered. These were delicious. Briny - almost to a fault - these were deftly fried and rendered crisp. The ranch dressing offered some respite from the salt at first, but to be honest, brought it over the top. But perhaps I was complaining because I knew what was to come for me.   Chicken Club Burger [$10.99]  The GF went with a ground chicken club burger, which came with the addition of ham, bacon, and cheese. The burger itself was moist and well-seasoned. The ham was a bit much, but who can say no to bacon.  Onion Straws Chipotle ranch dipping sauce  She opted for the onion straws, which were delicious, but added to the heavy nature of this particular meal. It came with a chipotle ranch dipping sauce, which again initially tempered the salt and grease, but really brought it over the top.  Bacon Cheeseburger on Steroids [$13.49] Burger, 3 pieces of jalapeno bacon, 3 pieces of applewood smoked bacon, Monterey Jack, Baconnaise, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, onion, pickle  And what exactly was I 'concerned' about? I had to get the bacon cheeseburger on steroids - replete with 6 slices of jalapeno and applewood smoked bacon. Baconnaise added to this calorie bomb, with the grease of the burger and bacon resulting in a soggy bottom bun. And first few bites were delicious, the burger itself was overpowered and even I couldn't finish this. Needless to say, I was drinking lots of water for the rest of the day.  Tater Tots Bad Daddy's sauce  I went with tater tots and couldn't help but enjoy these childhood favorites - crisp on the outside and creamy within, these were on point.   So if you're looking for a light meal during a layover, do not head to Bad Daddy's. But if you're looking to satiate an urge for mounds of bacon and grease, look no further - they've got you covered, and then some.",

The food is better if you sit for table service, but at least they have a fairly quick (15 minute - 20 minute during rush time) if you do the take-out window.    They have a some good burger choices.  The chicken burger options are good too.  Between the fries, sweet potato fries, and tots; I would recommend you go with either the sweet potato or tots.  The burgers are pricier than other burger options in the airport, but I find the quality better for the turnaround time than going to a Burger King, etc.  The price with a soft drink and fries is usually in the $16 - $20 range, and for the type of meal in the airport isn't outrageous.  The wait staff seems somewhat distant but I'm usually stuck flying late afternoon so I don't expect the most cheerful people.  The reason to eat here is the burgers.  They do have a bar so if you have more time to kill and aren't urgently trying to make a flight I recommend you dine in for a better burger",

I had about an hour in the airport during an early morning layover and strolled the concourse a bit trying to decide where to have a quick breakfast.  Best I can say is that for $13 for just a meh omelette and some under ripened fruit, next time I'm passing through Charlotte in the AM I will try another place.  I have to eat gluten free, so that left me with an omelette & a side of fruit to choose from.  Keep this in mind if you have to be GF. I do have to offer this location a special thanks for the comedy I was able to enjoy during my quick meal.  The couple next to me was hilarious to listen to.  The husband was so upset by the way his scrambled eggs were cooked that his wife began to literally slide down in her seat in what I can only assume was an attempt to pretend she could no longer be seen with him.  Was truly priceless.  As for what was wrong with his scrambled eggs (I mean, how can scrambled eggs ever really be wrong?) I have no idea. Summation?  If in the Charlotte airport in the AM, walk around a bit and try a different breakfast sport.  Maybe as the name implies, this place is better for burgers.",

Service is ok, but if you sit there for a little bit and no one comes over they probably didn't notice that you sat down so just get up and grab someone.   For breakfast the toast comes out like flavorless French toast which was really odd. The Jalapeno bacon is good and cooked well though so get a couple orders of that...and eggs come out like ordered (we ordered over hard and medium and both were fine). Getting anything \"custom\" such as a large glass of OJ with no ice is apparently difficult, we said we would pay for 2 small ones, but that concept wasn't coming across to the server.   Drinks are 13.99 each....WHOA! I mean a mimosa...holy surprise!   No place to charge phone unless your ok giving your phone to the server (and they are willing). They have a bar open early so you can get food and drinks it seems mostly all day.",

The other issue is that my waitress Kristen was completely vacant and unfriendly which culminated into placing BDBB's into my no fly zone.",

We got the fried pickles to start and they were delicious, as was the ranch dressing. I ordered the Pastrami Reuben burger and oh Mylanta it was great, just what I needed after a long day of traveling. For a side, I got the potato chips which were far too overcooked and inedible as a result. Otherwise, a great meal with good service.",

I had a burger craving after a week of island cuisine and overall healthy food (minus the alcohol). We stopped at bad daddy's and my boyfriend asked if they could have our food ready in 10 minutes and they delivered it in 9 (yes the cashier advised me). I got the original burger with white cheddar and bacon. It was juicy and delicious although the burger bun was a bit soggy. The fries were forgettable and I did forget them. They were super soggy and tasteless. My boyfriend covered them in bad daddy's sauce and finished them off. He ordered the chicken cordon bleu sandwich. He said it was good but nothing to write home to mom about. He did enjoy his bite of my burger though. We both ordered Oreo shakes and at $7 a piece, they were a fail. Not sure how you can mess up an Oreo Shake but they were a heavy, malty, weird flavor. Overall, for $35+ we could've skipped this spot and eaten at the Golden Arches. Nothing says welcome back to the USA like fast food.",

I was excited about the airport location for those visits to Charlotte when I just don't have time to go to one of the other locations.  However, this location is not anywhere near as good.    I knew as I placed my take-out order that it would require a wait time of about 15-20 minutes...which is fair enough to wait for a good burger.  I ordered the southern burger as chili on the burger is something I can't find in Cayman.  After waiting the 15-20 minutes and then getting to the gate, I was largely disappointed to find that they had given me a burger with only cheese and mustard.  I rushed back to the take-out to let them know that it was missing the chili.  The girl working the take-out counter did not seem to care much about customer service. She seemed to have a bit of an attitude and didn't listen well when I was telling her the problem so it took a few minutes for her to address it.  She was able to give me a little cup of chili to go to add to my burger.    I had ordered the burger medium and it came out well-done.  Although the burger still tasted excellent, it was not the high quality of the other locations. Bojangles in the airport is much better than this.",

The bun was cold and looked old as if it came direct from a plastic bag. The chicken was so thick I had to cut it and it was tasteless-no flavor . It simply had been fried.  I am giving it one star because. Tried my husbands sweet potato fries and it was nice but also cold. I came here thinking to beat the regular bad airport joints but next time I just go to any of the fast food joints.",

If you've got at least an hour to burn at CLT, it's a decent place to spend it.  They've got plenty of TVs playing NASCAR and baseball to keep you entertained between flights.    While it is an airport restaurant, it's definitely on the better side, but it's still an airport restaurant.  It can get pretty crowded during the lunch rush, with business travelers, families, all with suitcases and backpacks everywhere.  Service isn't quick, so if you don't have much time before your next flight, you might wanna hit up a different fast-food joint.  But if you are looking for milkshakes or mixed drinks, this is probably your best choice!",

After a quick browse of their menu which is posted on the wall, I decided on this place since they had a black bean burger option. My friends and I had originally wanted to dine in as it seemed pretty upbeat and happenin' but the wait time was too long and we still had a plane to catch!  So my friends decided on snackin' elsewhere while I took my chances and ordered from their take out counter.   After placing my order (black bean burger and tator tots), I stood waiting for my number to be called out. I think it took about 25 minutes which seems a little frustrating since I didn't even order anything with meat but whatever.  The woman at the counter was friendly and on top of things for the most part. If you need any condiments or cutlery to go, they are right there to the left for you to grab. My black bean burger was goodt- I was able to pick the kind of bread,  opted for simple and just had the basic lettuce/onion/tomato/pickle with pepperjack cheese. The tator tots came with a side of their signature chipotle sauce which tasted like BBQ sauce to me.      This was pretty solid airport food. Just know that depending on the time of day, there will be a wait- even at takeout!",

The menu is pretty decent.  They offer typical appetizers,  an array of hamburgers, salads and more.  What really caught my eye was that you can sub out your meat.  I had a bbq burger and subbed in grilled chicken. It was great! I splurged for a side of tots and was not disappointed.  It came with a sweet/tangy dipping sauce that I couldn't seem to put down.

His came with applewood smoked bacon and jalapeno bacon, both of which were very unique and tasty. Both of our meals came with a very healthy portion of fries and amazing barbecue sauce! It was tangy and smoky; I wish I could have taken a bottle home! We asked our server for a side of truffle aioli that normally came with the appetizer truffle Parmesan fries. She said she had to check with a manager but after a few minutes said it wasn't on the cash register and her manager said if they couldn't charge for it, they couldn't serve it. Luckily, her manager wasn't there so she hooked it up! Awesome, fast service and reasonable prices, for an airport. Our whole meal with a lemonade & a bud light came out to $43.

    "text": "Oooh yeah, bad daddy. Wait a second, this isn't the start of Alex L's erotica writings. Lucky you.  Apparently this is a newish chain of restaurants throughout NC, SC and Denver. I was lucky enough to run into it during a transfer at the Charlotte Douglas Airport. I needed an excuse to eat like a bad daddy (this is killing me) and lucky for me...it was Cheeseburger Day. I needed to seduce my wife, who is a pescetarian to indulge in a burger with me. Even the strictest pescetarian (auto correct wants to make this proletariat which would also be an accurate statement) can't resist bad daddy's allure of a juicy burger and she proved to be no exception. \"OK, just don't tell the whole Internet.\"  So we sat down, were handed a menu and both of us ironically fixated upon the vegetarian option which looked most appealing. It was a black bean burger with avocado, onions and some jalapenos. I asked our server about it and he suggested subbing the black bean veggie patty with a juicy meaty burger. My kind of guy! So I did and asked for it to be cooked medium. He warned me that it would still be pink in the middle which was purrrrfect.  My wife stuck with the vegetarian option, but made me promise to let her take a bite of mine. No problemo. I loved the fact that the burger came with a choice of fries, tater tots or coleslaw. I went with the tots. The burgers came out within 5-10 minutes, which is impressive since it was a pretty full bar / restaurant, but I guess they gotta keep it speedy at the airport.  I loved it. The bread was high quality, fluffy and the burger was cooked perfectly medium, which many restaurants seem to fail at. It was served with a side of sauce, tomatoes, onions, cheese and lettuce with avocado and onions on the base of it. The flavors came together wonderfully and the meat was seasoned very well. My wife and I exchanged bites and I loved her vegetarian patty and she seemed to enjoy the sinful delicious bite of my burger, breaking her normally pescetarian diet. \"You're not going to tell the whole Internet, right honey?\" \"This will be our little secret.\" We exchanged a sultry look while continuing to chow down. The tater tots were fantasimal as well -- crispy, crunchy and delicious. Her coleslaw tasted fresh and healthy.  Entertainment was plentiful as a burner sat down a few tables away from us and attempted to engage in conversation with the beautiful single girl who was sitting  at a table next to us. He was trying to impress said girl with his burning man adventures and we listened with glee placing bets on whether or not he would try to get her # at the end of the conversation (he gave her a business card instead).  Final verdict: delicious burgers at an airport. Prices are very reasonable for the airport ~10-12 a burger (you can substitute Kobe beef for an extra $5 if you want). I suggest getting the black bean burger but subbing the black bean patty with a juicy meaty patty.",

    "text": "Pretty good place for an airport restaurant. I grabbed the bacon burger on steroids and fries. This burger was huge! And came with different types of bacon along with baconaise! A bacon lover's dream.   The bacon was plentiful and very flavorful! A little saltier than some bacon, but considering that's how you make bacon, I don't consider it a bad thing.  I could barely bite into the thing it was so big! It had just the right amount of grease to it. Let's be real, a burger cooked with good meat (meant the right ratio of fat) is going to have some grease without being soppy and nasty. This was excellent!  Pros - cooked great! Asked for medium and got medium. It seems simple, but so many places can't get this right, especially in burgers  - ooh the bacon!!! - huge portion! - not a bad price considering the size and that it's in an airport - quick service! Great for when you don't have much layover time.  - bacon!!!!! (Picture that little baby trying bacon for the first time... got it now?) - tasty fries! Disposed some in the baconaise too for a little kick.   Cons - lettuce was brown, wilted shreds. Major turn off, so I picked most off - tomato was so-so. And since I couldn't bite into it well, it came off to fit better. I generally like some produce on my burgers, but was better without most of it (pickles were good)  Do you like bacon? Eat this burger!! Not sure if you like bacon? Eat this burger! Don't like bacon? Well then, we just can't be friends! (I kid, I kid!)",

The service is really quick so if youre looking to grab something and only have 30 mins they can make it work for sure.   Service is ok. Some of the restaurants in the airport use a table side call button you can press to call the waiter. I find it doesnt really improve service compared to other restaurants. They wait by committee so you just gotta ask them for stuff as they walk by otherwise you'll be waiting a while for your waiter/waitress to come back around.",

    "text": "At $40 bucks for 2 black bean burgers and a shake it was very pricey. We popped in here because out of the nearby options the black bean burger was the yummiest and most filling sounding as vegetarians. Despite various servers running around no one tended to us to seat us. I tried to flag someone down, made eye contact, said \"Hi!\", nope, no one was coming to seat us. We grabbed our own menu and sat ourselves down the only place available; the window bar. The chairs were uncomfortable. Soon after a waitress popped by to take our orders. We built very simple burgers, one with only avocado, and the other mushrooms and avocado. We didn't notice it was an extra 2 bucks for the black bean burger, so it was a bit of an unpleasant surprise later.  As it would have been cheaper to order the only veggie burger option and *remove* items, ridiculously.   Our food took roughly 25 minutes to get. In this time frame we saw two empty tables open up, we tried to move to one. Our waitress would not let us move even though we did not yet have our food after nearly 20 minutes. Telling us that the hostess had to approve but was too busy to be talked to and our food was about to be \"ready in a minute\". The wait was long, which was a bit nerve wracking when you have a connecting flight to catch in an hour.   On to the food! The strawberry shake($7!) was OK but too sweet. The black bean burger although crumbly was very good, the chipotle ranch sauce paired very well with it. It comes with a side so I picked the fries. My partner picked the chips/crisps, which were nicely crunchy and thin but needed more salt and/or vinegar for my taste. Also came with a bbq(?) sauce on the side which we did not order, bbq sauce was not our jam.  Tough the food was good, the service is very slow and it is quite pricey! If ever we have another connecting flight here we may just do a to go option if we were ever to try it out here again. But it's hard justifying $30+ for two veggie burgers.  Alas that's airport food.",

In any case I was craving breakfast, and when I think of Charlotte I think of some decent home cooking.  Sadly the meal and service at Bad Daddy's was the quintessential bad \"airport terminal\" dining that one dreads - large bland overpriced portions not cooked that well, with slow service.    The bartender seemed cool enough, but even though his bar wasn't busy, or the dining room, the room capacity looked pretty large.   Whatever the case, it seemed like my scrambled eggs and bacon took close to 30 minutes to arrive, which is uncomfortable when you have a connecting flight. The woman next to me had to ask for hers to go.  For $12 I expect a decent egg and bacon breakfast, but the bacon was to my misfortune burnt and tasteless, the eggs rubbery and bland, with the highlight being the fried potato squares.  It was a massive portion of subpar food.    I would definitely try not to eat there again unless I wanted those fried potatoes.  The bar was pretty cozy too.  Sorry Bad Daddy.  It was bad, Daddy.",

I ordered a salad and then was told they weren't serving salads or appetizers at that time (1pm). So I ordered a sweet tea and went back to the menu. Eventually I placed my order. Still no drink. After 20+ minutes of waiting I finally asked about it. I was brought water. After more than 30 minutes of waiting, my food came. Order was wrong but before I could say anything my waitress was gone and not to be seen again until it was time for the check. I waited about ten minutes in hopes of trying to get her attention, but I ultimately had to make the decision to eat warm food and make my flight or get what I ordered. I went with the former and never did get that tea... Two stars though because at least the food was good.",

Some of the fries were well seasoned, though not crisp, but others might as well have been plain strips of fried potatoes. The barbecue sauce that came on the side was good by my taste, but coming from Alaska, I'm hardly an expert on that.   My biggest complaint was the service; it took a minute to even find the hostess, and, once seated, I didn't see the server for at least ten minutes. I understand it was busy, and it appeared he was the sole server for the restaurant section, but there were multiple girls standing around who should be being used as servers, if only to turn over tables faster. I did receive my drink and food fairly quickly, which was appreciated after the wait; I just wish it had a little more attention to detail.   I wouldn't recommend this place, and if I come through this airport again will try the wine bar in the atrium instead.",

    "text": "I've been passing through the Charlotte airport a lot recently, and decided to try Bad Daddy's.    I flew in on a cold and rainy Tuesday, and was looking at a three hour layover, so I passed the time by eating at the bar at Bad Daddy's.    It's not a huge location -- maybe 80 seats total -- but the burger was one of the best I have ever eaten, especially in an airport.   They have a lot of custom burgers on the menu, but I decided to start with something really simple:   the basic burger with mozzarella cheese, cooked medium.    What arrived about 10 minutes later was a stunning masterpiece of flavor -- perfectly cooked burger topped with a massive amount of mozzarella cheese.    I opted for the tater tots (nice and crunchy), and somehow managed to finish everything.      With a menu like the one they have, I will definitely be back.",

You will notice this restaurant in the wing becasue it is almost always busy.  Expect to wait or cozy up really close to someone at the bar.  The interior is whimsiaclly decorated with old comic books, posters and ample TV's.  For those on the run, they have a quick service counter to the left of the opening.  Music is not overpowering.  The menu is all burger bar with very few salads.  For those that don't eat cow there are other options like turkey burgers and chicken burgers.  Their are a number of composed burgers with ingredients based on theme.  For those that like to build there burger there are a plethora of options from white cheddar to applewood bacon to fried eggs.   I have never had a bad meal here even if I was eating a turkey burger.  You can even eat paleo here becasue of all the options.  I will say the only dissapointment are the fries.  That not withstanding, it is always a safe and quite tqasty bet in the airport.  Until by next flying gastronomic escapade, dine fine.",

Usually in Charlotte I go to Carolina BBQ or Bojangles. They are fast and easy to eat once your flying. And also tasty but average.   Anyway back to the burger.   Decent bun. Good size patty. About 1/3 pound. Got cheddar and bacon with mushrooms. Asked for medium rare and got it medium rare. And to the person whose bottom bun was soggy. That's what you get with a good juicy not overcooked burger.   The fries were a bit to the cold side but they were still good.   Price. It was $16 with a drink and tax but what do you expect for a sit down place with a wait staff. So add tip to that as well.   It's not BK or Mc Ds. You have to pay if you want good food.   To me it was worth  the $20.",

I had a 90 minute layover recently on a trip to Canton Ohio and decided to get food before landing in Cleveland later that night due to the late hour.  As others have mentioned this location is very small and tight (can barely roll your roller bag through to get to seat)but the service was very efficient on the evening I was there and I was greeted and  seated within 3 minutes of arrival.  The menu looked very appetizing and there were a number of good salad and burger options.I ordered a Black Bean burger that not only was tasty and original but the fries (I love French Fries) were VERY VERY good. As a matter of fact in all my travels the only place I can think of that has better fries in the USA is Falafel's Drive In in San Jose.  I was so full after my decently priced meal that I slept all the way to wonderful Cleveland (God I hate traveling back east in the winter...that is why I moved to Phoenix to get away from snow yet I have to keep going back for clients in the Northeast in the dead of winter...cant complain though, those clients are great and good for business and I appreciate them) and vividly remember this meal as the highlight of this weeks trip.

Minutes prior to connection: 28 minutes- I was starving, went to Big Daddy's and told the waitress about my morning chicken wing fixation, and she told me that she would check with her manager since wings aren't normally on the breakfast menu.  27 minutes- she came back and sweetly told me that the buffalo sauce wasn't prepared, but they would be happy to prepare naked wings with hot sauce on the side. Go for it, and by the way, my flight is boarding in 13 minutes.  23 minutes- naked wings no hot sauce. oops, says waitress, they forgot hot sauce! 22 minutes- hot sauce appears, can I have the check? 21 minutes- check in hand, here's my credit card. Were the wings good? Yes, thanks (medium size, piping hot, well seasoned, crispy) 20 minutes- here's the receipt, thanks for stopping by. No, thank you for accommodating me! Scribble tip and signature and run to my gate, which is boarding. Wow, she even gave some wetnaps for the road! 17 minutes- at gate, boarding, I have 30 seconds to wash my hands and not make my neighbor hungry 15 minutes- I'm the last straggler at the gate, door closes. Nap ensues from food coma.  And that, my friend, is how waitresses earn a 50%+ tip.",

I was not expecting tasty food at the airport but this place hit the spot. Wish there was a Bad Daddy in NYC. I strongly recommend.",

Ice in OJ was a negative as was service, never came to check and they didn't put butter, and then took too long to come back for check.  Left cash, waitress missed out on a larger tip.",

I rushed to stop by to grab a bite to eat before my next flight but when I arrived no one would acknowledge my presence. Finally when someone did at 7:53pm i was told by one of the wait staff that they were closed. Funny, I was able to walk from Concourse C to E in time to sit down and order at Fox Sports before 8pm when they closed. Needless to say, I will not return or recommend anymore.",

    "text": "I usually eat at the sushi bar in CLT, however, on this day I was stressed from work and really wanted a cheese burger, the largest cheese burger I could find! I saw Bad Daddy's and made a B-line for the hostess stand. The waiter took a while to get to me. I ordered a glass of red conundrum and a water, I never got the water. My food came about 20 min later. My waiter never came by to check on me again (no, they were not busy), and I literally had to chase him down to pay my bill which was highly annoying considering I was on a layover (as I'm sure most people were), so I didn't want to sit in there for 1.5hrs. As far as the food, the fries were mushy (gross), and the burger did not come how I asked for it. And frankly, the burger wasn't that great, I make better one's at home, with better quality buns, especially for their prices! I will definitely not be returning. I'll stick to the sushi bar and better wine selection in the common area between the terminals.",

The yolk was popped and died up in a sticky mess next to and user the burger.  The wait staff is resigned to the craziness and over worked in non stop rushes.
