Some mornings I will walk my dog down to get my coffee from their caffeine buffet (always French Vanilla with a biscotti on the side). Their breakfast wraps are my favorite in town and easy on the wallet. I keep it simple with the bacon, egg, and cheese in a spinach wrap.   They also have an excellent wine and beer selection for fancy drinkers. And the staff is always friendly and helpful.",

    "text": "Laurel is great and the staff are friendly, however I find it sometimes difficult to verify my order with some of them because of the language barrier. Most speak and understand English perfectly well, but some will listen to my order, nod their head and turn away to prepare it and more often I end up with something missing or extra that I didn't ask for. It would be nice to see them prepare it or to have it verified back to me before they run off and make my sandwich. However I will always come back because the breads are delicious, the prices are great, and it is a hole in the wall secret you'll only know about by its faithful patrons. Do give it try, but make sure you are clear with what you want!",

I don't know what it is about businesses here but they sure don't like sharing parking.  I couldn't even walk over to Panera, there were hedges everywhere. So I gave up and wandered around the area that was accessible by my parking lot and found this little convenience store plus sandwich shop.  I saw some folks eating on the tables outside of the place and that clued me in to the sandwich aspect of this market. Well I went up to the sandwich counter and was kind of ignored by the two employees for a minute... granted they were both working on sandwiches but you know, you expect eye contact or something.  Then one of them asks, \"did you order?\" I'm like... \"no\".  Who would I have ordered from? At this point they would've had to have had pretty darn good sandwiches to put me back in a good mood and luckily they did.  I ordered a juiced up BLT with avocado and other deliciousness on it and it was very tasty and fresh.  It was made pretty quickly too, I guess there ain't a lunch rush on Saturdays.  So two stars for kind of lousy customer service, four stars for a very yummy sandwich.",

They had a great variety of breakfast and regular sandwiches and also many flavors of coffee, which I love. I got the Americano breakfast sandwich, which is huge, and a large cinnamon hazelnut coffee. Both were delicious. It was a little more than I would usually pay, but considering the large size, well worth it.  The only thing that I didn't like was the lack of seating with tables. I had planned to eat there and then run other errands, but all they have are benches outside, with nowhere to set my coffee and sandwich. If they could add some tables, it would be great. I do plan to come back and try some of their regular sandwiches in the future as well.",

This is a great place to go for lunch or to grab a dinner to go.  When the kitchen (deli) is open, they have a huge variety of at least 30 different hot and cold sandwiches with fresh and gourmet ingredients (lots of avocado, brie, hummus,etc.).  They offer side items like pasta and potato salad, chips, or fresh fruit salad.  The desserts (my favorite is the chocolate and cherry black forrest cake) are huge and to die for.  If you go after 5 than you can choose from the boxed sandwiches and salads to take home.  They also sell a decent variety of wine and beer.  There is also a location at 1515 South Blvd in the Dilworth/ South End neighborhood.",

Laurel Market is great - I love the vegetarian wraps and sandwiches - I usually customize something... exchange cheese types or such.   If half sandwiches are still available for half the price, that's often plenty.  Good wine selection too but I wish more current info was available on various bottles- descriptions, awards etc. The notes are sometimes dated and don't match bottles.  Laurel could sell more wine, open more locations, open patios and do so much more. But maybe that's the beauty of this neighborhood spot. Housed in a former 7-11, Laurel is independent, unique and overall, The Real Deal.  Let's keep it our little secret.",

There's no place to eat your sandwich, there are a couple of benches and a few chairs out front, so you are lucky to grab one.  My favorite is when you get lettuce on a sandwich they put two different ones, so it really gives it a nice texture and they aren't stingy with toppings, everything is equal amounts.  The store itself is great too, nice beer and wine selection, not huge, but decent brands. Plenty of chips, cakes and candies!!!  My favorite sandwich is the chicken torta, french bread, chicken, lettuce, tom, onion, black bean spread and extra jalapenos!  Yes, please!!  And I also love their bologna sandwich, it's sliced thin with mayo, lettuce and tomato.  I can't believe I order a bologna sandwich, but I have many times!!  Coffee and sweet tea too!",

As I waited in the line I read over the chalkboard mean of all they offered, which is a lot. Having never been before I decided to stick with a BLT with Turkey.  The service was just alright. I think because I asked a few questions about two of the sandwiches the lady was annoyed..Sorry, I've never been here.  As I waited for my sandwich I checked out the variety of other things sold in the store, chips, coffee, treats and wine. A cute little place with limited seating. I took my order to go and enjoyed the sandwich very much. I did love the mixture of lettuce, shredded and flat leaf. Gave the sandwich a little texture, and the best part, the bacon was well done and crisp, YUM. I would definitely go back if I were in the area.",

We got a wrap with turkey, bacon, and pepperjack, and then a crossoint sandwich with turkey, bacon, and ranch.  They were both great, and the bacon was awesome.

He let me sample the bacon (because I'm picky) before choosing it on my sandwich.  It was delicious.  I had the egg sandwich....let's start by saying I'm from the Midwest...north eastern Ohio to be exact.  While the egg salad may be a terrific choice for some, it just wasn't the style I am used to & will always love.  It was made fresh, it looked good, I'm sure if you enjoy that type...it would be perfect for you.  I just can't hang with the more southern way of making it. It was a little spicy as well, which is fine...but just not for me.  The store was clean, tidy, and organized.  There were many snacks and drinks to choose from.  Overall it was a happy experience.",

    "text": "Laurel Market is not like Common Market or Rhino market - it's way more food centered, and it just happens to have some alcohol there :) As we were walking up to the market, there were a couple of guys with dogs sitting outside just talking about life. I think that vibe pretty much sums up how life goes at Laurel Market - things are just laid back. When The Lady and I walked inside, there was a short line, but to our right were about 4 women working super hard making everything from scratch and taking orders as well. We both got sandwiches, I got the #10 which was Black Pepper Ham, Artichoke Spread, Havarti, Cucumber, and Sprouts on wheat bread (but you can choose whatever spread you want). The sandwich came out very quickly, and so did the Lady's. We took our food home, but not before looking down in the cooler and grabbing one of their homemade treats (the homemade treats are about $3.50, whereas the off-shelf ones are like $10. You know my choice. It's not even a choice at that point.)  The sandwich was extremely fresh and flavorful, and the bread was the perfect way to wrap it together. I loved their selection of different menu items to choose from, and they have a written menu alongside their daily specials. Along with food, they also have a good wine selection, convenient store staples like a pops freezer (yes, with King of Pops), and a few other pantry goodies, like a healthy collection of Cloister Honey. They also have a great coffee station as well with a bunch of brew options and all the extras you could want. When we're in the neighborhood looking for a fresh, healthy snack, this looks like a fantastic option that both The Lady and I would be more than happy to revisit.",

Even though there is almost always a line, they work fast and make fantastic and unique sandwiches.  The ingredients are extremely fresh- the lettuce is crisp, the veggies are crunchy and the tomatoes are some of the most beautiful tomatoes I've ever seen (juicy, plump and actually red!). The place is definitely low key with few frills, but that's part of its charm!  I love everything I've ever had from laurel market but my favorite has to be the #11: smoked turkey, lettuce, tomato, honey mustard, apricot jam, dried currants and walnuts- it sounds weird but is seriously so delicious! So much flavor and great texture from the nuts and currants. I have dreams about this sandwich.",

I got it on focaccia, but next time I would probably choose wheat to compliment the sweetness of the apple. The sandwich was HUGE and lasted me for 2 lunches. It was a great deal!  Prices were very reasonable and they had a huge variety of options. Even a vegetarian had a plethora of options, which is rare for a sandwich-centered place. I love that everything is made to order. It's super convenient for to-go food, but maybe not so much for spending time there. There wasn't much in the way of seating.",

The ladies behind the counter take orders, answer the phones, make sandwiches, and call out when your creations are ready.   Along the walls are displays with chips and snacks, and beverage coolers. Cases along the sandwich assembly line feature premium meats, cheeses, and refrigerated prepared goods. There's no good place to wait. You're going to be in someone's way no matter where you stand.   Once you've collected everything you'd like, March your way over to the cashier, where again, there's no good place to form a line.   It's take-out only, unless you're cool with parking yourself on one of the benches out front.   I will say, the selection is hefty and the sandwiches are quite good. They have gluten free bread for sandwiches and there doesn't seem to be an upcharge for it. But learn from our experience and call in your order or be doomed to endure a thousand \"excuse mes.\"  Bottom line, this is a Common Market without the personality.",

You need to grab one. They are delicious. They are in a red wrapper   Laurel market makes great sandwiches, breakfast and lunch. (They stop making them at 3)  they have lots of drinks chips and candy to choose from, They also have pre-made items or a menu to choose from that they'll make fresh. There is always a line so if you are in a hurry be sure to call in. However, there can often be a language barrier.... They struggle understanding sometimes and often mess up your order.   Susan the manager is super nice and this place has a lot to offer. It's basically a local gourmet convenient store that makes really great fresh sandwiches and is Open til 10pm. (Don't forget you can't get a custom order after 3, that part closes down)  Oh and There's really no seating unless you want to pop on a bench outside. So plan on take out only.  Enjoy",

It's a local shop that is a store/market that also has a kitchen and has some of the best sandwiches you can get in Charlotte.   They actually have an option to order and pick up online which is a much needed time saver for this place, especially around lunch. This place can get busy and since it is small - it can get a little congested at times. If you walk in, you might get your sandwich in less than 5 minutes, you might have to wait 15 minutes. But the wait is worth it. The quality of the ingredients are fresh, crispy and oh so tasty.  The variety of sandwiches is vast from the types of bread to the toppings. You won't be disappointed. The sandwiches are huge and very filling.  While you are there you also have the option to pick up local items such as chocolate, beer, jams, pickles, etc.   Worth checking out!",

I'm all about chicken salad and they had regular, curry, and tarragon (so good)! I've had the curry before too and that was surprisingly really good. They have the typical deli sandwiches as well turkey, ham, cheeses etc. which also looked really great. Next time I go I definitely want to try one of their specialties they have listed on the boards up front.   My boyfriend got a bacon, egg, and cheese. The breakfast menu was quite elaborate as well! We're from NY and have had some trouble finding a good BEC. Laurel market definitely compares and will probably be our go to from now on!

The ingredients are amazing and the selection of cookies, cakes and brownies are divine. From sandwiches and homemade salads, the place is really spot on and a local treasure.  My one complaint, and I was going to take away a star, is that the hours on Yelp show Saturday from 6:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. I arrived at 3:45 p.m. on a Saturday and the place was closing for the day. They probably had another $200 in potential business waiting for food service but the deli counter made it loud and clear they were closed. The only food available was pre-made/pre-packaged. The deli closes at 2:00 on Saturday and Sunday. This should be reflected on Yelp. Not their fault for this incorrect posting.  Just ordered Brunswick Stew and a Garden Tuna Wrap for delivery through Door Dash. Can't wait!",

After placing my order I walked the market and looked at all the rare items they sell. I grabbed the Sesame Ginger Salad from the cold deli fridge that my friend recommended and paid.   The sandwich was delicious. It was a great combination of ingredients. I was able to eat half the sandwich and save the other half for dinner. The salad wasn't what I was expecting. It was a cold noodle salad with black sesame seed. I was expecting the salad to not be so dry. I enjoyed it but wish it had more of a dressing to it.   I was really impressed by the posted menu the Laurel Market has and will be back to try some of the other sandwich choices.

I've only had the breakfast sandwiches which are made fresh & they are so delicious. I literally brag on this place all the time to people.

There were a ton of chip and drink options, as well. Service at the deli was not super friendly but it was quick and our order was correct. Gentleman at the register was a bit more outgoing and friendly.

They are open late and were a godsend when we needed some vanilla haagen dazs to go with our pecan pie on Thanksgiving. They have nice wines (including champagne) and a great selection of local and craft beers. The only reason they do not receive 5 stars is because the prices are quite high. Also, it took 20+ mins to get two sandwiches and a bag of chips on a recent Sunday (the kitchen should get all orders in and make all sandwiches first come first served, not the current system where someone orders and that worker makes all sandwiches in that particular order). Great local spot!",

I had heard about this place when I first moved to Charlotte and stopped in for breakfast sandwiches last month. The first time, it was later on a Sunday and it was pretty busy and they ran out of a lot of ingredients like rolls and American cheese. The second time, we were smarter, and came earlier on a Saturday. It wasn't too packed and everything seemed to be in stock. I love their bacon egg and cheese on a ciabatta. They press it on a grill at the end so the bread softens nicely. The egg portion is generous and the bacon is cooked perfectly-it's also layered perfectly, which satisfies my type A heart. My husband got the breakfast sandwich with sausage and bacon, which was also pretty epic. We're from New York and have struggled in other cities to find a proper egg sandwich. This place does it right. No frills, just good food. And the sandwiches are reasonable priced. They also have amazing looking slices of cakes and treats near the deli counter. I tried the strawberry cake recently and it was delicious. They have your typical selection of drinks and chips, and also a large section of wines and beer.",

The quality of products is amazing and they are the only store I've ever been to that has everything I could want in one place. Alternative soda options, honeycomb, craft beer and a plethora of IPAs (my absolute favorite), ice cold champagne (sparkling wine, though some may be from Champagne, France) options ranging in price from $20 - $90 so that a range of budgets can have champagne. Whole Foods doesn't even have as many options in the alternative soda department! The fresh sandwiches they make are delicious and the attention to detail is on point. For example, in the sandwich called The Valium (an Italian) comes with oil and vinegar and most places will put it directly on the sandwich, leaving a soggy mess by the time you eat the \"to go\" order, 20 or 30 minutes later. Here, they packed it on the side without my having to ask. The turkey avocado was also delicious and portion size is similar to the better deli's in Manhattan. I just can't vocalize enough accolades for how amazing this outwardly humble store truly is, just like the most amazing little shops in NYC. Love it!",

We formerly lived over in the Wesley Heights area and loved Rhino Market (still do), so when we swung through Laurel Market, it was like being back at home. I would say a smaller variety of food options than Rhino, but larger selection of sandwiches if that makes sense. Also the coffee selection is \"on fleek\" as the kids say. I'd guesstimate that they usually have around 8-10 canisters of different options, local and not, available. Plenty of pre-made sandwiches, pasta salads, desserts, and other grab-n-go items if you're in a hurry.  I've had the Mercado sandwich for breakfast and lunch, and would have it for dinner. Also great selection of beer, wine, and some provisions. Only issues I have is the lack of tables/seating. Some benches outside, but nowhere to really sit and relax without having your drink on the ground and food in your lap.",

However this place cranks out some of the BEST breakfast and lunch sandwiches I've ever had and at a dirt cheap price! My personal favorite is the Americano which is fresh cracked eggs bacon sausage and American cheese on your choice of bread - and there are tons of bread choices. From artisanal breads to croissants or bagels, you name it they've got it. I personally get mine on the Bolillo bread. These sandwiches are no small serving and for $5 well worth it. They also serve like 35 different flavors of coffee. Highly recommend you check this place out if in Charlotte",
