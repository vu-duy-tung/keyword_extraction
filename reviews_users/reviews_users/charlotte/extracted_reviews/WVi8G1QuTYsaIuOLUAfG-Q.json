Eggs were a bit under cooked for scrabbled.  My husbands omelet has only about half cooked.  The worst was when  I found a LONG reddish brown hair in my grits.  Needless to say GROSS and won't come back.",

In particular we went for breakfast on July 4th morning before the town parade.  It was busy like it normally is when we go however this morning was the worst experience we have ever had.  The hostess was a complete jerk, very unfriendly.  The waitress was ok however it took forever to get anything from her, drinks, food, refills, etc.  The cashier was terrible.  We had 4 meals that we were paying for and she just punched in a ton of number and gave us a total that seemed much highter than what we should have been paying.  After questioning what we were being charged for she developed even more of an attitude and ran down a list on menu in about 10 seconds.  I am still almost certain we were over charged but she didn't want to take the time to explain it and it was busy so i just let it go.  If they don't like working when it's busy then maybe they should just close the place....I will not be visiting this place again.  Terrible service, below average food and they over charge you.",

I ordered the Baked Chicken with 2 sides.  The side items were fine.  But the Baked Chicken was undercooked.  It was pink on the inside.  I ate a couple bites, and it was obviously not \"setting well\" with me.  I am not one to complain, so I just paid the bill and left.  Upon getting home, I became very sick (stomach-wise), and upon the advice of my son, I called Nick (the owner) to give feedback.    (My son told me \"if they don't know it, they can't fix it)  My conversation with Nick was highly insulting as a patron.  He insisted my stomach issues were not from the chicken as he has NEVER under-cooked chicken.  He made no effort to \"make it right.\"  I politely thanked him for his time and hung up the phone.  There are too many other restaurants in the Harrisburg/Concord area for Nick's casual approach to not have adverse effects on his business.  I hope Nick reads this and will re-consider his approach to other less than desirable experiences had by other patrons in the future.  CC",

Other friends that I have gone here with have gotten some of their specials and they always look good. They give you big portions.  You won't leave hungry!   It always amazes me that this place is just a 5-10 minute drive outside of the Charlotte city limit and how \"country\" it is in comparison. The wait staff never seems to be in any kind of hurry. It may take a while to be greeted after being seated. For me the place always seems a little dirty. The diet coke is flat.  I'd go back for the good diner style food and cheap prices.",

Such was the case with Harrisburg House last July when it burned one night.  We were lost without our regular dinner spot and spent the last 5 months searching for a decent place to eat.  We have always appreciated the good food, fresh wild-caught fish and farmers market vegetables all offered at very reasonable prices.  Suddenly, we were faced with more expensive, smaller-portioned dinners at chain restaurants.  Thankfully, Harrisburg House is open again in an even bigger and better way.  The restaurant has been redesigned inside and out into a bright and cheery dining environment.  Most of the staff has returned and the food is as wonderful as ever.  Owners Niko and Bill demand quality, good service and customer satisfaction.    We are so very happy to have this restaurant open again!",

This place is very simple, by no means culinary excellence, but they do have a very broad array of menu items- and the ones that I've tried have been very good.    Super affordable prices, specials everyday of the week.  Service is always very good.  The place does have a strange smell sometimes which I've not quite been able to identify, and is very small in size.  I would imagine that there is a wait during peak times.

They were beyond disrespectful and when we just said we are going to return it (since they refused to correct it) they yelled at us. We finally had to threaten to leave the food their and dispute the charges. They finally gave in and refunded us.

This is too bad and I hate to have to write a negative review, but when I sit and wait 20 minutes while others are being served, eat their meal and leave, I think that is unacceptable. Maybe they manage will correct this, but I am taking a leave of absence from this place for a while.

Upon arrival, my mom went in to see if they could accommodate a double stroller and was told that wouldn't be a problem and the wait would be 20-25 minutes. My mom spoke to the 2 hostesses and clearly  explained the size of their stroller three times with her hands, since we have twin boys and their stroller is larger.  Our babies are too little for a high chair, so always stay in their car seat in the stroller that pushes up to tables. We have eaten at a number of fine restaurants, and all have accommodated us, never have we had an issue. We've eaten at Ruth Chris with them, to small diners like this restaurant, never a problem. Until today. After waiting 20 minutes in the waiting room, the manager told the hostess that we were not allowed to bring the stroller in. He did this through a windowed door in the back of the restaurant. Never once coming to talk with us. I saw 2 tables that would perfectly fit the stroller and was told no. One was for a larger party and he refused for us to sit there and at another table that would've worked perfectly that was a smaller table. A number of customers were appalled at how we were treated, refused service, after taking all the right steps to enjoy a nice lunch after going to a nearby pumpkin patch. One lovely lady in a wheelchair said, \"This is not right. What they're doing to you isn't right!\" Another couple said, \"I just can't believe this! I'm so sorry for you guys.\" It is a lot of work bringing a baby out, let alone 2 babies. We were discriminated against at Harrisburg 'FAMILY' House for bringing our family to their restaurant and refused service. The older manager should be fired, and the staff should be better trained to talk to customers. My mother and I were embarrassed, angry, and in complete disbelief. And my babies were hungry, as we were going to give them their bottle while we waited. The inadequate communication and level of discrimination was abhorrent and unacceptable.",

She was super loud asking us what we wanted to drink. My little 7yr old nephew innocently asked for more drink and again she was rude saying give me one minute. Another thing and final straw that made me livid was when she finally bright the food out. She gave the wrong plate to my brother in law who along with my sister ordered a vegetable plate. He kindly told Savannah what he ordered with the hope of getting it corrected. She then says everything that you all ordered is here you just have to figure out what goes to who. At that point I had to speak up. I told her I've been trying my best to be patient with you Savannah but you've been rude since we got here. She then begin to talk over me and tried to act as if I wasn't even talking to her. I said I need to see a manager. She had the audacity to say he's right over there. I went to him and explained what was going on and requested a new waitress. Neither he or Savannah apologized but he did send a new totally opposite and awesome waitress named Caroline and he offered my Mom a free dessert since it was her birthday. Yes we (family) took my Mom there to celebrate her birthday, needless to say it wasn't so happy . The food was good but because I received such terrible service from Savannah I'm giving them 2 stars. Maybe Savannah's family owns the restaurant and she felt entitled to act a fool but it was totally unacceptable no matter who you are! I will go back because the food is good and the other staff was nice.",

Committing to have Sunday breakfast at 11am at this family oriented restaurant was counter-intuitive. Realistically we may have waited 30 minutes, but I had a good time talking to other people waiting, interacting with cute kids, and chatting w my friend so the time went quickly.  At that time we had a choice to go with lunch, but both of us chose breakfast.  The coffee left a little to be desired for my tastes. I like rich, medium or dark roast, and this was more old-school that likely plays better to the crowd.  The menu had lots of great choices. I ordered a California omelette but asked that they make it into a scramble instead. My friend ordered the meat lovers omelette. My eggs came out great; the avocado and the fresh tomato was just the right ripeness and it was seasoned well, salt-wise. There was an enormous portion of grits, and my rye toast was served dry as I asked. As the scramble was three eggs, the plate was a small mountain of food, and all of it very good.  My friend liked his eggs also. Our server was pleasant enough. That she made sure I got the eggs and toast as I asked was appreciated considering how busy she was. My coffee was refilled at just the right times.  It got loud there a couple times with a semi-trained toddler acting up at the next booth and 2 large family tables near us, but it wasn't unbearable.  I liked this place, and look forward to the next visit.",

    "text": "I wasn't thrilled with this place. I took my grandmother on a Sunday morning for breakfast which of course was extremely busy, but not at all the issue as this was expected. The food is definitely only mediocre. They served my grandmother a gigantic slab of Ham which was very salty and I think I scratched up the plate trying to cut up for her because it was so tough. I had an omelette (Which was also very salty) , served with grits. they  put my grits and omelette on the same plate so that the grits overtook the omelette. we asked for wheat toast, however, the basket contained seemingly a variety of breads and they were all rock hard as if they had been recycled.   All the staff seemed aloof, especially the waitress who we had to tell, as she took our orders, to get her tip from the previous patrons off our table. After bringing the food she disappeared. A little while later a woman who barely spoke English  walked up and asked if she could take our plates. At this time my grandmother had a plate (and mouth) full of food plus the fork in her hand. I responded \"she is still eating but you can take mine\". The woman just walked off and didn't take my plate. The waitress retuned shortly before we left and simply said \"have a good day ladies, you can put the tip on your card\".   Maybe it was residual effects from full moon from the previous night or perhaps just an off day, but I won't be returning here.",

Then the hubby and I decided to go out for breakfast and didn't want to go too far and this place seemed like the perfect spot.  Now on to the experience...  The outside of the restaurant and even the decor on the inside has a nice old time country feel. Nice and cozy.  The wait time was about 10 minutes on a Friday morning, not too bad but when we sat down I don't think the waitress knew we were there because we sat there almost another 10 minutes and saw her tend to a couple that came in after us.  Anyway, a busser realized it and must have said something to someone because then she came over to us and took care us.  Hey, it happens sometimes at least she came over promptly afterwards.  Now the food....  We ordered the Strawberry Waffle Combo, Pancake Combo and a side order of French Toast.  I must say they are VERY GENEROUS with their portions.  The food didn't taste pre-frozen, pre-made or out of a can.  It taste like it was cooked to order.  The food was pretty good and cheap.  Why go to IHOP when you can get a better breakfast meal here.",

Nonetheless, either way, 'your choice', it's one of the least expensive steak specials around and boy is it good and flavorful; as well as surprisingly tender. Their Breakfast is also great. You'll have to try their Steak & Eggs.  To be completely honest, their entire menu is extremely good and their price-point is extremely appealing.",

This place is VERY popular on weekends. We got one of the last tables available at 6:20 on a Saturday. Come to think of it, we have never been in this place when it wasn't hopping. It's inexpensive and the food is consistently tasty.  I had a salmon steak, green beans, beets. The meal came with cornbread, garlic bread, rolls, hushpuppies, and some minor salad greenery.   My wife had a beef tips dinner that looked wonderful. It was enough for two, or in her case, tomorrow's lunch. It came with greens and squash.  One of my twins had a stuffed pasta shell dish that was enough food for triplets. The other had spaghetti with meat sauce and meat balls, children's portion, big enough for two kids. My daughter is a vegetarian, so she just ordered veggies... They don't have any great vegetarian choices for protein, other than a Vegetarian Hoagie.  I'd go early if I were you.",

And it was! I drove over from campus and was immediately seated even though lunch was in full swing. I looked at the menu, saw the daily specials and decided on the Famous Beef Tips over rice with mashed potatoes and fried okra. I also saw they had a big dessert case and tried the peanut butter chocolate cake with really good dark chocolate icing on top. The potatoes were not fresh but tasted really well with the beef gravy on top, and the fried okra was frozen but was not greasy so that was a plus. The beef tips were pretty good though, and the rice was cooked well, and the peppers and onions were awesome! The cake itself was just okay but the peanut utter icing was the bomb. As was that fancy chocolate icing on top of the peanut butter icing. The waitress answered my questions very well and was knowledgeable about just about everything. Keep up the great work!",

I have been back 2 times and the food has not improved as far as I could tell but the waitress was very nice and did apologize for the policy of no substitutions, do not go here if you do low carb,  Hell, do not eat here even if you don't.     My husband does eat here and sometimes takes (forces) one of the kids with him, he likes the food, but he will eat most anything.   If you like good food for your money look elsewhere.",

    "text": "My family and I have been here 3-4 times since they've opened up. I read through the reviews before deciding to finally write my own. Yes it is owned by a Greek family. Yes they mix Greek and southern cuisines, but the food is just not good. It is cheap though, and it is greasy, and that HAS to be the reason why the restaurant is almost always packed in this down economy. I think over the years I've had the cheeseburger, dry with little to no flavor which belies the greasy footprint it left on my plate. The beef tips were served with rice that was cooked to mush and the tips themselves were over seasoned (Greek seasoning to boot) and over cooked.  The Philly cheese steak sandwich was not much better. The only reason we have been here so many times is because of out of town visitors wanting to try the place and family members wanting to meet here. If you want a more accurate description of what the review SHOULD be for this place, scroll to the bottom of the page and enter the filtered review section, there is a bit more honesty there in my opinion.",

We used to visit the restaurant because we lived in the area and luckily we won't ever need to go back.  The food is classic diner - heavy on the salt and grease. That's what some folks like - I get it.   But the grease could at least arrive hot like it should.  At our last visit, we advised the lady at the front desk (frequently rushed and can't be bothered to give a smile) about dirt on their wall.  When we went back months later, the dirt and grime was still there.  Service is often shaky..don't be surprised if you must ask 4 times for napkins or new silverware.  Lady at front desk will argue with you if your ticket is incorrect. Harrisburg deserves better than this - when some decent restaurants appear they may have a tough time.  Wish I could give a better review but sorry, H'burg Fam.  The truth hurts.",

The roast beef was overly salted and the shrimp creole was lacking. The fried okra and fried squash was pretty good.   The worst part of our meal was the dessert. We ordered two slices of cake ($6.25 each) and they were terribly dry and tasted freezer burned. We told the waitress Crystal, and she understood and took them back. She returned a few minutes later and told us that they could not take the cakes back because \"all cake sales are final.\" WHAT?! How can a restaurant have final sales on food when only a few bites were taken from the cake? Well, the waitress came back to talk to us about it. She said  the manager that was there said he thinks we were trying to \"pull one over on him\" and we must've just wanted a few bites and to get our money back. She said this would not have happened this way if the main manager Nick was there but unfortunately he's gone for a month. Unfortunately, we spent $13 on inedible cake and we will not be returning to this restaurant again. Also, all the cakes are FROZEN, so don't get your hopes up. I'm sorry Crystal had to be in the middle of this because she was such a great waitress.",

    "text": "The wife and I stopped in Saturday morning. I had been scoping this restaurant out for quite a while because I am looking for a good go-to breakfast place that isn't a chain. I ordered the California Omelet without the tomatoes, grits, and biscuit. My wife ordered the Pancakes, scrambled eggs, and bacon.  My meal tasted great. The avocado, mushrooms, and cheese flowed really well in the omelet. Usually omelets are too dry for me, but these fillers definitely helped the taste. The grits were awesome, especially with a little cheese added.   My wife did not enjoy her meal as much. Originally, she requested that I find a restaurant for breakfast because she was craving a good pancake. Having chose this place, I assumed that she would love it, I was wrong. She thought the pancake had an off flavor, almost like it came from boxed mix. She said it didn't have that buttery \"griddle\" taste. After having a bite, I could see what she meant. To me it wasn't terrible, but definitely not the best I've ever had either.   Her bacon was extremely greasy. She could barely take a bite or two from it. However,she really enjoyed her eggs with cheddar. But since her main purpose for visiting today was for a good pancake, this did not help their case. After the meal, she felt very disappointed.   As for the positives, our server was awesome. She was very personable and attentive. We were given refills consistently and our orders were accurate. Apparently we beat the morning rush (barely) and were able to get seated right away. All in all, I liked this place, but I don't think I'll add it to my rotation.",

I am basing this update on a specific experience- but I had been there a few time before this happened.  I visited with my husband and son- and ordered a Reuben.  He had the beef tips and was pleased.  I ate half of my Reuben- and then started eating the other side.  I felt a hair in my mouth- (barf-ewwwwww just reflecting on this!) and pulled out a dark hair out of my mouth.  (For the record I am blonde and my husband is bald haha!). I was sooooooo grossed out and that will be my last visit.  I know this can happen anywhere but on a place I was already scared of- this finished my interest on this place.

This diner-meets-restaurant, offers a wide variety of choices including salads, steaks, BBQ, and seafood just to name a few, and I didn't mention a full range of breakfast treats.  Dora here. Or desserts!! How could you leave off this goodie case, Ernie? lol. Parked right by the waiting area. Yeah, try walking by this without drooling. Those chocolate bears behind that red cake called my name.  Actually, we were headed to another restaurant in the area, but that was a bust because they were closed. With the help of our foodie apps like Yelp and Zomato we found this gem a short ride away. And when we walked in and spotted the fire truck photo, BONUS! Has to be good, right? lol  I chose the Boneless Pork Chops with turnip greens and a garden salad. This plate came with two large lean pork chops, oozing juice and with an amazing grilled flavor. The turnip greens were good and served with pepper sauce and the salad was a great start to the meal.  Dora here. Normally the Steak Tips dish is laden with onions, rice and gravy, but since hubby and I are trying to eat a little less carb heavy lately, I opted for just the steak and peppers, which were tender and well seasoned. If the green beans weren't fresh, they were a fantastic replica, not mushy but not al dente, either. Overall, a happy dance in my mouth.  Considering the crowd, our food came out lightning quick. Great value and flavors, healthy options, and giant portions. If not for the close proximity of tables, the loud chatter, and the curtness of the server, we might have stretched our rating to five. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog",

Great breakfast at a reasonable price.  I ordered a deluxe omelet with cheesy grits and toast.  I've never seen such a large bowl of grits served as a side - ever!  My husband ordered the Meat Lovers Omelet that was tasty as well.  He ordered  a side of gravy but wasn't anything spectacular (he thought it was just powdered gravy).  As I'm writing this we just realized the server mixed the order up .  Because of the mixup and the decaf coffee error I'm only rating them 3 stars.  I'd still recommend this restaurant but would pay more attention to what we were served.",

I have only had the chance to swing by here during lunch however I can't wait to try their breakfast some day! Their baby kale salad is a must have if you are looking for a healthy but filling lunch option.

Excellent menu with a combination of Southern, Italian and some Greek cusines.  I order the two boneless Pork Chops with Okra and Potato Salad.  The two Pork Chops were nice and thick and very juicy and great taste. Okra was nice and hot. As for the Potato Salad, it was good but not great. Little contract in texture.  My wife ordered the Meatloaf with a Sides of Okra and Buttered Corn (not on the cob).  She loves Meatloaf and according to her, this was delicious.  Service is very good and efficient.

    "text": "After enjoying lunch and dinner here for years, we finally had our first breakfast here late on a Sunday morning. Of course, as always, it was packed full of cheerful customers. One thing I love is their $4.59 M-F daily specials which include two eggs, bacon or sausage, grits, toast or biscuit AND coffee. That's what I like to call an \"I dare you  not to eat breakfast here\" deal which is quite rare on the south side of Charlotte (except for Stacks in Matthews.)  Since our visit was on Sunday and the special was not available, I had to improvise. It was a pretty easy decision however as I had been lusting after the Red-White-and-Blue Waffle since seeing photo of it from a fellow Yelper. The waffle was light, flavorful and golden brown crunchy on BOTH sides. \"Duh!\", you might say, \"All waffles are crunchy on both sides!\" Not True. Quite frequently they are little soggy on one side due to being plated too quickly.  If I'm gonna drop $7 on 10 cents worth of batter I want it to be perfect, or at least as good as what I can make at home. The strawberries, bananas and blueberry atop it were fresh and delicious. Sometimes they can even be an afterthought, but not here.  We also ordered eggs, bacon, sausage, grits, hashbrowns and biscuits. (Hey the waffle was our \"breakfast dessert\", which as anyone whoever reads my reviews knows, is a must for our family!) Both eggs were tasty, despite the fact that both were cooked over easy when I ordered mine over medium, which seems to be a common occurrence most everywhere. The bacon was plentiful and tasty but the sausage was dry and crumbly.  Grits were good but presented poorly on a flat plate instead of a small bowl. Hash browns were a little undercooked. Biscuits did not taste homemade, but I'll take their word for it that they are. Real butter was not available in lieu of that buttery spread concoction.  Coffee, reasonably priced at $1.59, was acceptable and above average. Real half-and-half is provided but not raw sugar, which is always disappointing.  Sanitation score was an impressive 98 as usual. Service was friendly and attentive as always. Considering the overall value and consistent food quality, this joint is a Gotta Try in my book for breakfast, lunch or dinner.",

The staff is always friendly and accommodating, the restaurant is always clean including the bathrooms and if you time it right you won't have much of a wait.    Today's selection the Thursday special - Turkey - real cornbread dressing (not that bread stuff)- real mashed potatoes- and fried okra.  The portions are insane for the reasonable price!  I have lunch for tomorrow.  :)  The hubster had the baked chicken, dressing, greens and candied yams!  He cleaned his plate.    While I did not get them today I have also enjoyed their carrot salad with the Greek spin they put on it.    My only suggestion - this was actually our first time doing carryout and instead of bagging or putting my fried okra in a separate container they lined the top of my meal with paper and placed the okra and bread on top - not a fan of that option!    I would recommend this place if you want a good \"just like mom makes\" meal for a very reasonable price with comfortable \"just like home\" feel.

As we looked around, we saw a lot of families so the place stays True to its name.   We were seated about 25 minutes after we arrived and browsed the menu after ordering our coffee. I got the corned beef hash and eggs special which came with hash browns and a biscuit for 6.95 and my fiance got the bacon and eggs special with hash browns and a biscuit for 5.45. It took another 30 minutes for us to get our food so from the time we walked in until we got our food was about an hour-- a huge amount of time, even for a popular breakfast place.   The food was delicious, the service was average, and the price point was fabulous. We would come again.",

    "text": "I love breakfast / brunch places. After our heavy rotation of our typical breakfast spots, the fiance and I wanted to try a different place.  Overall this place was meh, but it wasn't aweful and probably return to try more of their menu. It was busy, which is a good sign, but the food wasn't what I would have hoped it would be.  I had ham and cheese omelet with house potatoes and toast. The omelet comes with 3 eggs. It tasted good, but the house potatoes were so greasy. I like grease, but these were like swimming in fat. Not sure if that is the reason they lacked flavor too. I had to add salt and pepper for some flavor. The fiance had the pancake special. Which comes with 2 pancakes, 2 eggs and bacon. He said it was good, but also noted we could have just gone to Waffle House. (Which we frequent often - I did say I like grease!) He did like that the syrup came in a little pot that is warmed.  House coffee was good, I like that the creamer is on the table already, you didn't have to ask for it.  DR PEPPER: Yes.   Staff: We got seated quickly.  The server took a bit to get our orders though, it was busy lunch hour, so understandably.  Location: Lots of parking!",

Well, last Monday with the snowstorm keeping everyone inside was our opportunity to give it a try. A quick call to the restaurant and sure enough, they're open!  Quickly seated and offered coffee and menus. I went with the waffle and strawberry, two eggs over medium, and bacon. I was really surprised with how fast everything came out, but when you consider that they are normally serving 20+ tables most mornings and today it was only a handful, they were probably riding easy street in the kitchen today.  When the food arrived, I got a HUGE waffle! Nice crispy exterior and clean, savory flavor. Eggs were spot-on over medium. Hot, crispy bacon complimented the meal nicely. I do wish the fruit offerings on the waffle were more than just sliced fruit. Most places do a strawberry waffle served with cooked strawberries in a glaze. Still, a very good breakfast.  Between the quick service, good food, and very affordable prices, it's no wonder this place is hoppin' nearly every morning. I'll be a return customer for sure!",

I should preface my review by saying I'm not a big fan of greasy, southern food so off the bat I had a strong feeling this wasn't going to be a spot I enjoyed.  I was wanting to have a healthy lunch so I ordered grilled grouper and I believe it had been pan fried. The fish was unappetizing, paper thin, and looked as though it had been taken straight from a Walmart freezer bag and dropped into a pan of grease. I think my meal was around $13, and I believe I took 2 bites - 0 flavor and TONS of grease!  I was not impressed, but my friend enjoyed her chicken sandwich. I think I'm just not into restaurants of this kind, so disregard my review if you like southern cooking.",

It had chunks of real chicken, carrots, and rice in a long lovely rich broth.  Absolutely perfect!  Service was excellent and the noise level was tolerable, background music was low enough conversation was possible...and during our conversation we decided we're coming back again!

I had fried okra and potato salad sides I don't even know where to begin with the potato salad it was creamy and scrumptious.

(I never had a restaurant bring out the sides without the protein) steak didn't come for another 8 mins! My husband was almost done with the grits and eggs by the time his steak came. Unacceptable! I ordered a bacon/egg/cheese omelet and got a bacon/egg minus the cheese? I got toast instead of biscuits...I needed more syrup for my pancakes but again the assembly line made me feel like I would be backing up the factory conveyor belt if I inconvenienced my server! At the end my husband went to pay I stayed at the table...The bus girl started clearing all our plates! When my husband got back and I tried to get up she was still reaching across the table to get plates cleared...I actually had to wait for her to get up to prevent us from bumping!

I've sampled the chicken pot pie, Calabash Shrimp, Crispy Chicken Salad and Stuffed Shells.  They were all very delicious and filling. The food isn't gourmet or really outstanding but it's good and sometimes that's just what you need.    The service is great and for some reason we always get out of there under 15 bucks with a tip.  You can't beat that.",

There are so many selections that it is hard to decide, but rest assure you will be happy when you get it. Lunch and Dinner are fantastic as well.  The best fried squash and okra.  The country style steak is so tender you can cut it with your forK!  I have never ordered anything that was not delicious!!  If you leave hungry there is something wrong with you and not the food.  Also,  the prices are very reasonable and the service is great!   I always leave with a carryout box.   Please try it you will love it like my husband and I do.  Beverly Christenbury",

We had onion rings for an appetizer and they were crispy and had just enough onion flavour to be perfect in my eyes, and I ordered the Athens beef strips with fried squash and sweet potatoes as my sides. Honestly, as somebody who ate rice growing up like, every day I wasn't thrilled with the instant rice it came with, but the beef was tender and flavourful, and the fried squash was fresh and hot. I'm probably weird in that I save my sweet potatoes for dessert but I'm glad I did. Dessert in the case looked really good but I didn't have room.",

Their portions are large and I haven't had any main entrees here that I didn't like. One of my faves is the Spaghetti with meat sauce and the country steak over rice.  The only downside are their cakes. I had one. While their portions are huge the cake is tasteless and in something in an attempt to keep the cake moist. They are no good. I thought about trying some of the cheesecake or something else but decided not to. Other than the cakes...I love this place! Breakfasts are awesome as well!!'",

When you walk in you'll notice that the resturant is always packed full of people but the wait is never long at all especially for groups of 3 or 4.   There are a list of specials every day that are always great to choose from. Even the place is extremely busy the service is incredibly fast and the waitresses seem to be attentive. Come hungry because food portions are generally huge on most entrees I always leave with a to go box. The desserts are better than any family restaurant I've seen. The Baklava cheese cake and red velvet cheese cake are my favorite.   If you need good food and not a lot of hoopla try this place very rarely is anyone I've ever brought here disappointed!",

Very laid back, family friendly....just like Harrisburg. The staff is great and make you feel right at home. Been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner many times....every time a winner.

Well, there have been a few times that I have stepped outside of the box and tried a few dishes that I usually wouldn't try when strapped for cash (when I usually eat here), and I have rarely been disappointed.  I never would have ordered steak tips for fear that they would have been dry. Well, they were a little dry, but still good. The pork chops, on the other hand, are beautifully cooked. My friend almost lost a finger when he tried to take his fork back from me. The fried squash and grits are great choices as side dishes. The waffles are evenly cooked, but I found the pancakes a  bit greasy. This is the case for most of the menu. You will never be mad that you spent your money on a certain dish, but there are definitely those dishes that made you wish you had a magically refillable plate.   I recommended Harrisburg Family House to a couple passing through town last summer and I would recommend it to anyone else. It won't knock your socks off, but it's a good, safe bet.",

For a good home-cooking southern style meal THIS is the closest thing I've found in/near Charlotte.  My only criticism is that they need to get a better way to pay. The cash register line is ALWAYS backed up and way too long. They are under-going some renovations on the outside of the building currently so maybe they will fix that too.",

When we pulled up, the parking lot was packed. We figured this was a good sign. There was a wait since it was around 9:30 on a Sunday morning. We waited on a comfy bench, however the wait wasn't long at all. We were seated in under 10 minutes. The food was excellent. There are only two complaints I have. One would be that the grits I ordered were not in a separate bowl and mixed with my scrambled eggs. In the scheme of things, not a big deal. The second complaint would be the friendliness of our waitress. She wasn't exactly rude, however, she wasn't very friendly either and acted as if she was in a hurry or had something better to do, which is why I'm only giving this place only four stars. However, like I said earlier to food is wonderful and leaves you feeling completely satisfied, and the prices are very reasonable. You definitely get your money's worth here. I will definitely be coming back and highly recommend this place for breakfast. It's now a new favorite of mine!",

She got an attitude and said that the ticket was correct.  So thanks for the free cheesecake because you couldn't be bothered to listen. But it doesn't make up for the attitude problem.

From breakfast to pork chops, it's a good local place where everyone can get what they want. Most items are made in house so all of their \"regular\" food has some flavor. It  doesn't seem to taste overly processed like many of these places do.   The chicken parm has to be the best thing that I have had there. It is better than Olive Garden and is only $9. The Marinara sauce is a little paste heavy. Asked the waitress what was the best thing on the menu, and even inquired about a review on the wall, but unfortunately she did the thing I detest, and just read the menu to me.   We also tried, this time, the chicken pot pie. It had good flavor, even the gelatinous goo holding it together tasted like chicken. Unfortunately, they covered the pastry (the pie part, no crust) with sauce, so became soggy.   Everyone in there is always really nice and the service is good. My sister and I eat together all of the time and people assume that we are a couple. The lady at the register had us pegged as siblings in no time, she's the first!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Femoteuntildeath.blogspot.com&s=46044604b22a3a4703564184a5ec642a7086d6fca369fc8d4b2dd9ca307a6b98\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">emoteuntildeath.blogspot...</a>",

    "text": "It was good \"diner\" style breakfast. Tons of varieties of things from all kinds of omelets,  to waffles, pancakes,  french toast,  etc. Servers were nice, prompt and pleasant. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because the coffee was absolutely awful. Other than that, there is really nothing negative to say about the place. Cost was good too. Breakfast for 8 was only $65 and we ate like Champs. I'd go back if in the area again.",
