I paid for extra cheese and ,wow, if that was extra ,the regular amount would be scant.  This has given me a bad impression and think the place is overpriced and not real concerned with quality",

We had looked online at the lunch menu and the food looked good as well as the pricing for lunch.  When we arrived on a Saturday for lunch we were told that they have no lunch pricing and what was in the menu was definitely dinner pricing, this was the first thing that we were not thrilled with.  We decided to give them a try any way.  Had calamari for an appetizer and it was just so-so, ordered a large but that was not enough for more than 2, disappointed.  The food overall was just not that good, my fettuccine alfredo was bland, no fresh parmesan for the top and the noodles were all glued together, my mothers salad was good and that was about it.  All of us were so disappointed in the food. We paid $140 for lunch after a $15 coupon for 5 people and that is without TIP!  We will never go there again.  If you like the food at the other two well known places then save your money and time!",

The service was terrible, apathetic, Etc. Etc. During past visits the waiter made a big deal out of bringing Fresh bread and pouring oil and balsamic vinegar in the dish on the table. This visit I finally had to ask for bread after we got our antipasto and entrees. He brought it and the bread was cold. Same with the wine we ordered. Took forever to get two glasses of wine. Not sure if this will be our go to place anymore.",

The wine was subpar and overpriced, they ran out of meatballs but charged us anyway. Then blamed it on the PGA tour. We were seated immediately so they weren't that busy. The waiter wasn't attentive, esp for a restaurant at this price point. Then when we questioned it, the waiter said the garlic mashed potatoes that were substituted were more so he left the meatball in the bill.  Really? Mashed potatoes cost more than meatballs? We should have gone to Olive Garden for the meal we received. Not going back here again. I forgot.... when we first sat down, I put my hand in sauce in the seat. Good thing it wasn't my white pants!",

    "text": "So this past Friday I held a birthday dinner for my mother here. I chose this place because I had quite a nice time when my company held the holiday party here. Things quickly got off to a bad start. I reserved the Pope Room 2 weeks in advance, called twice and also drove to the restaurant twice within that two weeks, yet when we arrived we were seated at two tables elsewhere. Initially I reserved for a party of 10. After learning my mother wanted her coworkers to be in attendance I called back to reserve for \"up to 18.\"   I told our server the seating mix up and she went to get a manager, who came back basically to tell me I was a liar. I tried to explain I made the reservation 2 weeks ago and I came back the day before to pay in advance (at which point the manager I then spoke with told me that wouldn't be necessary b/c unless they'd hold card info they don't do advance payment), but before I could finish she smirked & replied \"No you didn't because we don't accept advance payment.\" This did not go over well with me, or the party she said this in front of. I told her do not cut me off and she put her hand on me. I yelled don't touch me & tried to finish what I was sayin but she cut me off AGAIN and went to get Eric (the manager I spoke with about menu options the day before). He explained that once I said our party could have reached 18 people, the option for the Pope Room automatically is removed in their system. The staff would not know I had once asked for that room.  If it was not for Eric and the servers we had I'd give this place 1 star and a BBB complaint because that woman who came out arrived with nothing but conflict in mind. That was a great showcase of poor management; Eric shouldn't be there doing damage control for another manager's behavior. The servers were tipped handsomely for their awesome service & upbeat personalities, although they were quite timid after the explosion between guest and management. However, I will NEVER return to this place.",

Our entrees included macaroni rosa and shrimp florentine.  The macaroni was delicious, but nothing you couldn't make at home that was just as good!  My wife took one bite of the shrimp florentine and spit it out.  She said the shrimp were not fresh and the dish smelled very heavy on the seafood side!  When we brought this to the attention of our waitress she said, \"sorry, I love shrimp\".  When our bill arrived I had to ask for a manager who did come over and take off the $27 dish that everybody at our table thought was disgusting.  It was hassle free dealing with the manager, but the waitress should of taken care of this since everyone at the table were not satisfied with the dish.  Not sure I will be dining here again!",

We made reservations thinking that it would be packed on a Sunday afternoon..  We visited on 11/9/14 and I wanted to wait and cool down before writing my review on this restaurant..  Upon arrival, we quickly realized we would not need the reservations. Whereas everywhere else was packed with waiting, Buca di Beppo had 5 cars in the parking lot.Once inside we were quickly seated (after the hostesses fought about where to put us)...  First thing, drinks.. Yes, they do have sweet tea but no, there is no way they make it fresh (unless they are just that skilled to make it taste like pre-made). It was horrible. They also carry Pepsi products, which is a preference to them but not us...  Secondly, I do meat sauce on my spaghetti (Hubby wanted to do the meatballs). I asked to order it that way, $3 charge, okay but give me meat sauce, not clumps of meat chopped up and no sauce. The meatballs were huge clumps of meatloaf (Hubby even said, \"If I knew it was meatloaf, I would have ordered it to be on the side and asked for ketcup.\" Also, the spaghetti is definitely served \"italian style\" not overcooked (I liked it but Hubby likes it cooked to death).  Third, the chicken parm is really good and it was the item we enjoyed most. The sauce was even good but, note to our server, it is NOT something you reheat because it does dry out.   Fourth, we got a coupon for a free desert on our anniversary. We ordered the cannolis and they were not good. The creme was very bitter and I could not stand them. Really wished we ordered the sundae but we knew we were full and didn't want to waste it...Oh and the singing, ask before coming to the table with candles, we are NOT outspoken people and really stay to ourselves. We hated it!  Finally, when we finally got the check, we went to pay and our server went to hide. We finally went to walk out and finally found him in another dining room. It was the first time that I have ever had to track down a waiter to give them money. I was just thankful we paid cash, so we could walk right out the door..",

The tiramisu for desert was excellent and huge, unable to even finish half of it.  Service was very good and did not feel rushed at all.

The pasta was fine (not great, just fine) and the sauces were okay, a tad on the heavy side. Their \"famous meatball\" was impressive in size but flat in flavor. The antipasto salad was good, but we got so sick of how cheesy it was. Could have used more meats and less cheese, for sure. (But, they're tailoring to the mall demographic, so I get it). The prosciutto stuffed chicken was good. There was WAY too much breading on it, and I ended up scraping off a lot of that. The chicken was a tad chewy, but not outside of what is to be expected for this kind of place.  The service attendants were quite nice, though. I have nothing bad to say about them.   The restaurant was FREEZING. I know they advertise having A/C as a positive attribute, but that doesn't mean it should be 60 degrees in there. I literally was blowing on my hands and rubbing them together, and that was with a hoodie on and long pants and work boots to keep the rest of my body semi-comfortable.   We went because we had a $50 gift card. If it wasn't free, we probably wouldn't have gone. We probably won't return unless we're given another card or we're in a major food bind and have to settle for a place like this.",

I'm not sure why it took us so long, because it's super noticeable coming off the highway heading towards the mall.  Anyways, my dad's a huge fan of Italian food, so he likes to go here whenever he's craving anything like that.  They recently started doing family style -- where each Small Plate serves 2-3, and each Large Plate serves 4-5.  We were stumped -- we wanted to try a few different dishes, so I asked our server.  Enter the Quattro Formaggi, a 2-chicken, 2-pasta dish for $20 that was perfect for us.  Great rec from the server, and he took care of us really well.    Food was good -- a little cheesy for my tastes, but I'm not the biggest fan of Italian.  It was still good, and my dad liked it a lot.  Leftovers were gone within a few hours.  Also, their bread is good with the oil and vinegar.  The cool thing about this place is that once you walk in, you've got hundreds of pictures and images on the wall -- I don't think that there's one blank white/red space at all.  All black-and-white and sepia pictures of people enjoying pasta, movie stars, baseball players, boxers, you name it.  It's kind of overwhelming, but it adds a cozy-ish atmosphere to the place.  Very Hollywood.  Overall a good experience, with excellent service.  Come with your family.",

The meals are huge its family style so everything is shareable. I love the deco of the restaurant some very interesting pics. All pastas are to die for the salads are pretty basic but cost about 13.oo dollars minimum. The masalas I tried it out Saturday it was very sweet to me but the leftovers on Sunday were great.",

    "text": "We drove 25 miles from Lake Norman to Pineville to enjoy this restaurant. What a disappointment. We were seated adjacent to the bar area. It was 85 outside and close to that inside. They had a portable air blower sitting on an adjacent table. Luckily a good bottle of wine helped cool us down.  First we ordered the Florentine bread as an appetizer. We paid $15 for four pieces of bread. It was very unimpressive. Maybe the nine dollar garlic bread would have been better. Surely more flavorful.  Next we ordered a Caesar salad. While the salad dressing was tasty, the lettuce was WARM! So disappointing. It must've been sitting on the counter a long time before they brought it to us. We should have sent it back but didn't. By this point we weren't expecting much from the entrees.  My husband ordered the chicken saltimbotta with artichoke hearts and capers in a lemon butter sauce. I had a pasta dish with 4 different types of stuffed pasta. We rated both fine, but nothing special at all. The words acceptable and bland come to mind. Each dish was around $28 and served 2to 3 people so we had plenty to take home.   By the end of the evening, with a modest $30 bottle of wine, we spent $115 not including the 20% tip. While the food was barely average, the atmosphere is a nice place to take friends coming in from out of town. There isn't an inch of space on the walls that's not covered by old photos and memorabilia from the 40s and 50s. It's very eclectic and interesting. So if you go, don't have great expectations for the food and take friends to share the large portions and the high prices. Next time will simply go to Caruso's in Mooresville instead.",

Where does someone get chicken parm with no pasta without someone saying \"do you want pasta with that?\" Bucca Di Bye Bye. Calamari fishy and no marinara? Oh is that extra?",

While we were waiting on the hostess to show up, one of the staff (apparently she's the manager, we found that out when the table behind us made a complaint about their slow services) ran passed by us and out of the door like we were invisible. So we waited. Finally someone showed up and seated us (the manager returned to tell the hostess how hot the weather was outside while she tried to show us our table).  As we walked through the restaurant, it was very quite and nearly empty. Our waitress took our order relatively quick, and brought out bread etc. per usual. We didn't realize how long we waited until our 4 year old started to become fussy. 45 mins! We didn't get 1 dish! As soon as we could find our waitress, we asked her whether our food was on the way. Her response: 'any minute now. But I can bring out the salad first.' Sure. It took her another 10 minuets to bring out our salad. By now it's over an hour and we still didn't get any entrees. We told our waitress to cancel our order and walked out.  Get your acts together and hire a better management team!",

They have their own table in the kitchen you must reserve and you eat while watching the chefs cook. It's a family style so it's really perfect if you have a bigger family. For just two ppl it's a little harder cause their portions are so big that you should share. We weren't blown away by their food. It seems as though they use their large portions to overcompensate for the lack of flavor. There food was good just didn't seem to \"wow us\". It's more of a really cool atmosphere.

It appeared they seated what few customers they had in the bar. The table I was seated at had food on it and the server never offered me any bread. I'm not sure if BUCA's stopped offering it or my server chose not to bother. I was going to bring my grandsons in for their birthday but will pass.

Manager Noresse came over personally to follow up because we they did not have the Balsamic that I love for my bread, so no worries, he and Mars got to work and brought us yummy Balsamic Glaze, which actually tasted even better! We tore that up! Several servers came over to offer a big \"congratulations\" with a the amazing lemon cake and a big candlestick to make me feel so special.  Although the meatballs and spicy chicken pasta weren't as good as usual, I can say that the client service as well as the $20 off of $40 (super high value) coupon from the e-club made this trip very memorable. Ask for Mars and Noresse and you will feel like King or Queen for the day!!!",

Not bad just loud chain restaurant, not too much to say. I had the apple gorgonzola salad which was decent and some pasta. I believe the calamari wasn't terrible for a chain. Godere!

There was grease all over the floor and it was super hot and steamy. The game entire restaurant smelled like must. Then we sat down and the hostess was incredibly cold. Our waiter finally arrived and was totally stoned. We ordered our drinks and he came back with one of them. Then he asked us if we were ready to order, so we ordered. He then came back with our second drink and had completely forgot our order (that he had written on a napkin by the way). So we confronted the manager and he was just as stoned as the waiter. At this point we had had enough and left, without paying. DO NOT GO HERE!!!",

I am writing this in the parking lot of the restaurant mind you. My girlfriend and I pretty much regular customers and we always order the colossal brownie sundae when we come . It is one of our favorite things to do because we can never finish the whole thing . However, this time it tasted horrible, absolutely disgusting . The brownies seemed watered and down and were so hard we couldn't cut them with the spoon, and there had to be only two scoops of vanilla and chocolate in our dessert that usually comes with 5 or 6 scoops. I don't know if there was a different chef on duty or manager but we have never had this kind of experience before and we are extremely disappointed.Also when we told the waiter (Aaron) he seemed as if he didn't care and basically looked as if there was nothing to be done . All I'm saying is , maybe make sure to come during the nighttime when the crew is better .",

    "text": "My family and I have come here on several occasions (usually big groups) and have thoroughly enjoyed our experiences, but it has been at least 5-6 years since I last dined here. The visit I am reviewing was for take-out. I used their order ahead system and was given a time of 6:11 for my order to be ready. Nearly 30 minutes after that time, my order was still not ready. I kept being assured that it was \"almost ready\" multiple times. People came and went... still no food for me. I was picking up food for a few friends, so I kept them waiting as well. When I finally mentioned how long I had been waiting, they comped my salad, but the food still did not appear.  Some things I noticed during my extended time sitting in the lobby: The hostess was NEVER at her station. The young lady working the take-out counter continuously had to leave her post to assist customers coming in who needed to be seated. There were times when customers were left standing in the lobby waiting for more than five minutes before someone appeared to seat them. Other staff members (kitchen staff and wait staff coming off duty?) walked through the lobby but never addressed these customers (a simple, \"Are you being helped?\" or \"Someone will be with you shortly,\" or even \"Hello, welcome to Buca di Beppo,\" would have been nice. I also noticed wait staff sitting at the bar chatting and flirting. This was a Tuesday night and the restaurant wasn't busy, but still wait staff sitting at the bar? One girl was even reapplying makeup and fixing her hair.  When my food finally came, the rigatoni looked like all the ingredients were just thrown in a pan. It was barely warm even when I first got it, and totally cold by the time I got to my friends just 10  minutes later. The salad (chopped antipasto) was very nice and tasty. The chocolate cake was HUGE and very chocolatey delicious. The garlic cheese bread was cold, not cheesy, and just plain old soggy.  It appears this location has a serious management issue. The will continue to get customers because of the chain's reputation, but that will only last so long.  Everyone's entitled to a bad night... they will get another chance from me, but just one more. I am generally a positive person and most of my reviews are 3 or 4, but this particular visit earns a 2... barely.",

They just told us 20 to 30 more minutes before our food would be out! Unacceptable! My son has already fallen asleep with no food! To top it off there is a huge leek in the roof with streaming water coming down. They have a bucket that is filled with dirty water on one of the tables to catch it. While sitting here I have also observed people eating in the kitchen waiting on the food. Even the manager just put food in her mouth waiting at the window for food. At least our waiter is nice. We will not be back! UPDATE: It is 3pm & we still have NO FOOD! 2 1/2 hours later! The manger is terrible also we had to ask what happened and all she said was sorry the food will be here shortly. I told her this has ruined my Mothers Day she says it has ruined mine to. Know one in the restaurant has food except for 3 tables & the lobby has cleared out. UPDATE:We ended up leaving at 315 with no food. We never saw our waiter or the manager again. We went over to Olive Garden and they were so nice. We told them what happened at Bucca & they said that is crazy they will take care of us. They had a lot of people waiting but were turning the tables quick! They gave us drinks & breadsticks while we waited and ended up seating us 30 mins later. We were eating 20 mins after we ordered. We should have went there to begin with!",

Most of the occasions have been very big like anniversaries, birthdays,  engagement parties, etc. we have never ever had a bad experience at this restaurant.   The food is always perfect as well as the service being incredibly attentive. The desserts are mind blowing as well as the different menu items. I like the fact that they serve family style--that Way everybody gets a chance to try something new.   Their service members are just delightful people and they always work at putting you in just the perfect room for your size group and somewhere that you ask to be seated they try their best to get you in that table.  You can even request the table in the restaurant kitchen so that you can see what goes on while they're making your food! Personally, I really like to cook so one day I would love to sit in the kitchen.   This is always one of my top places to choose when someone asks me where I want to go to eat.    They have a very nice wine list and I've never had a wine that I wished that I never ordered. The The serving staff is well versed in which wines are paired with the meals that we order and we've never gone wrong by taking their advice.  I love this place, and so does my family, and most anyone that I've ever asked about the restaurant told me they if they had been there, that they absolutely loved it. I wish I could give them more than five stars.",

I made reservations through OpenTable and was certainly glad I did as there was an hour and a half wait without one.  The service was excellent from the hostess to waitress.  The Fettuccine Supremo was underwhelming as there wasn't any seasoning or much taste to it- I had to add salt and pepper to liven it up. All of the other dishes I observed other people order looked amazing and it seemed as if the taste matches it. Maybe I'll try another dish and my palette will be satisfied the next go 'round.  Oh yeah, the Groupon came in handy, so with the garlic bread, drinks, and entree, our total came to $4.30 with the Groupon. Not bad for a party of two.",

Our waitress was super friendly and willing to answers our questions patiently.  Family style dining is fun, probably more so with a larger group to share with. We ordered a side dish of Alfredo for our niece because she couldn't eat a whole dish alone and neither my husband or I care for Alfredo ourselves. We decided to share the Quattro al Forno with ravioli, canneloni, manicotti and stuffed shells. We ordered a small, which states it is for 2-3 people to share. Hmm. Not sure I am buying that. It was a pretty small portion in my opinion for the money and the price. It was good, but not great. Chicken canneloni was my favorite.  The hubby ordered a meatball on the side and while it was big, he said it lacked the ooomph he was hoping for. Bummer.  We would go back with a group, but probably not on our own. I rounded up a 3.5 trip due to the great staff and eclectic atmosphere.",

    "text": "Always drive by this place when you go to the Pineville mall and decided to sign up for the reward club and they sent me a spend 40 get 20 off and a free small pasta dish. Me and my girlfriend went and I got a large pizza and she got a pasta dish and jeeze the small pasta dish was huge! My pizza even huger being a large. If your a sauce lover make sure you order extra sauce on your pizza. Wasn't saucey enough to me. This place is very cool all the pictures on the wall, the wine ceiling and how they walk you threw the kitchen.  There is a table to eat at in the kitchen. If your looking for a cheap meal this could be a bad spot for you. Dishes are pricey but they are family dishes so they come with a lot of food. Would be very good to go with a group. Pasta dishes are between 15-30 dollars. Pizzas are 15-30 dollars as well.  My pizza came with about 18 slices. Lots of leftovers which is always a good thing! Look forward to going again with a group to try all the other pastas. They give you a free thing of bread and pour olive oil in a bowl for you to snack on.",

While we waited for our table, other customers were being told that it would be at least an hour and a half wait. This place was not crowded, in fact as we were being seated I saw many empty tables. Our waitress was not the greatest, she was pushy and short with us. This is a family style restaurant so you can either order a large or small plate. I thought even the small plates were way overpriced and the flavor was way underwhelming. The service was very very slow. Unfortunately we were seated near the kitchen and at some point we heard a commotion that sounded like a kitchen fire. The decor was dated and busy and also filthy, I noticed inches of dust and cobwebs on their kitschy decorations. I would not willingly go back to this place, I've had way better from my own kitchen!",

The food was so-so.  I think the \"schtick\" here is the family style entrees.  When you order spaghetti and meatballs, you get a huge bowl of spaghetti with 2 or 3 meatballs the size of of a softball.  The meatballs were not very good and it was kinda awkward dividiing them up.  I'd rather have 8-10 smaller meatballs to share.  The atmosphere of the place is great... very Italian feel.  Can't rival a joint in the North End of Boston but they try.  Suggestion to the restaurant - move your dumpster.  It sits prominently in the parking area on the same side as the main entrance.  And, if the wind works against you, you get a full blast of all kinds of wonderful smells.  Not good going in and certainly worse going out!",

Went back tonight and I will say the service was terrible. At the beginning of the ordering process, I asked if a drink was included with a kids meal. The answer was yes. We then ordered the kids meal for my daughter, chicken parmigiana and spaghetti.  Got the Caesar salad as well.  Again, the food was good.    But we ran out of water and sprite - had to flag another server to fill up the sprite. Never got the water replenished. Our server showed back up after a 20 minute hiatus - there were only 3 tables occupied by the way. She brought the bill and it had a $3.29 charge for the kids drink. I showed to the server thinking it was merely a mistake. She then said since we brought it in a big cup, there was an up charge. Hmm.. told her we didn't ask for a large cup and if that was a small up-charge, then was full price? She said no problem, she would take care of it.   She takes my card and rings it up - brings back the bill where she did remove the $3.29 but then charged my $1.99.  Well - glad the restaurant got the $2 for the kids drink. Server got a paltry tip as a result. Honestly, lucky I left one at all.  Hour and a half meal when there was no one there.   With that said, we will go back as we like the food. But only with a good offer / coupon. If the service was good here, would easily be a 4 Star place.",

Many years ago we would have argued that no Italian was better that Buca in the region. We allowed one year since our last visit only to  discover that things have gotten worse. The service was horrible half the restaurant was empty however we still had a wait of 50 minutes and watched numerous families leave because they quoted a 1.5 hour wait while the restaurant was half empty. When seated we were greeted with a rude waiter that didn't even know the soft drink offerings. The food is ok at best and for a family of 4 including 2 children a 100 bill is absurd for the service and quality of food. I really hope for the sake of Buca they decide to hire experienced management staff. Sorry I'm done",

My group tried the caprese, antipasto salad, sprouts with prosciutto, and rigatoni. The caprese was the only memorable part of the meal, unfortunately. Antipasto salad was bland, and the parmesan cheese offerings were from a shaker on the table. The sprouts tasted unseasoned and even the prosciutto flavor was underwhelming. My rigatoni had very little marinara sauce, which meant that it had very little flavor-a but like eating plain pasta with a few teaspoons of sauce. It was slightly embarrassing because I brought out of town guests for dinner and we all felt the same about the food. Our beverages also didn't taste as though they had any alcohol at all.  The service was great though! I will go elsewhere for my Italian in the future.",

I personally am not a big fan of place a that serve food in big portions because it takes away from the seasoning and taste, but I am not picky, food is food. It was a good experience.

    "text": "My last trip to this place was really disappointing.  I shared an entree with my mom.  I got the fettuccine Alfredo as a side dish.  The fettuccine is my all-time favorite pasta meal.  Unfortunately, the noodles were really tough, the food was cold and there was little sauce with no taste (bland, bland, bland).   I ordered the fettuccine as a \"cheat\" meal.  If I'm going to consume LOADS of calories at a dinner and break my diet- I want it to be worth it.   This left me feeling discouraged that I cheated without getting any joy in return.   Today, I begrudgingly agreed to go back for lunch and ordered the soup and salad as SIDE dishes. It was after 2 and obviously not crowded.  Our server's ONE-AND-ONLY table just consisted of my parents and I (3 total).   My mom ordered the chicken limone and asked for a side salad as a dish.   When our food came out- my order and my mom's order got totally screwed up. The waitress had to return to the kitchen and correct her mistake(S).   My dad also had a 20-dollar coupon off a purchase of 40 dollars. He showed it to the waitress at the start of the meal and gave it to her when we finished eating.   Our total came out to 37 dollars.  We had to order something else in order to get the discount.  No big deal.   We decided on the tiramisu.  It was a large portion but not at all sweet.  It tasted more savory than what a dessert should be.  My parents thought it was ok.  When it was time to go, the waitress screwed up our bill (making another mistake) leaving the coupon out.  My mom asked for a to-go water cup not one, not two, but 3 times.   The waitress made so many mistakes with us it really confused me.  How can you go so wrong when there is only one table?   I wondered if she had been huffing out back and lost a lot of brain cells at once.  Overall, if it were left to me- I would not go to this place again.",

    "text": "First time back to a Buca di Beppo since we left Chicago in 2002.  A zany place where every room is a collage and story.  Photos adorn all the walls, even in the bathrooms.  And the themes are irreverent, like The Pope room, tastefully done, but, zany.  We took our 8 & 11 year old grandchildren here and I was surprised that they \"didn't get it.\"  They did not get the humor of the rooms and themes, so I guess that comes with more maturity.  Food is Italian and they have a pretty good menu.   But beware that the dishes are served FAMILY STYLE, which means that the food comes in portions that will accommodate 4 or more people.  It gets tough when you have two fussy grandchildren who each want something different, especially when we grandparents want something else.  You can end up with an awful lot of food.  Fortunately, they have a kid menu, so we went with the kid cheese pizza and lemonade.  Whew!  Wife and I did the calamari and penne al forno.  The squid was rings and tentacles and done very nicely.  We asked for more marinara sauce which was freely given.  Used the sauce also for the penne.  And the penne was flavorful with that marinara.  Having traveled in Italy, we very much like the Sicilian wines and others from the Puglia area on the heel of the boot.  Buca does have a number of such wines and they were just great with our meals.  Kids were non-plussed, but it mattered not to us.  We just enjoyed the zaniness and good service.  An A-OK experience.",

Food: We got lasagna and the pappardelle bolognese with sage, both small sizes as this is a family style restaurant. Lasagna was fine, the bolognese was not great. A ton of pasta and not nearly enough sauce. I felt we over paid for the whole thing based on the quality. If you are someone who would not go to Olive Garden then this may not be the place for you. They are an unfortunately sad version of Maggiano's.  Atmosphere: This was the worst part to me (and I'm all about hole-in-the-wall type places)! The restaurant feels like it's from the 90's and it should have stayed in the 90's. It's maze-like inside, dark, dank, pictures everywhere (which isn't bad when not out dated). It was over used, under cleaned, and the bathroom was...atrocious. It's too big to be kept up properly. Really big parties come here. I kept looking around wondering how anyone else was eating here. Our host took us through the kitchen before we were seated. I've worked in restaurants, the only kitchens you should bring customers through would be high end, michelin-star type places. Other than that, restaurant kitchens are dirty/work spaces and not meant for guests, for real it was strange.   I had 2 family members tell us not to go and we should have heeded their warnings. Yikes, what a mess. Go to almost any other chain or local restaurant if you want Italian.",

We had the Apple Gorgonzola salad that even my 10 year old son liked! Then we had the Chicken Marsala and mash potatoes and topped it off with chocolate cake.  My children enjoyed their make your own brownie dessert in the kitchen too!  Thanks Norrese Ball and the service team for a wonderful evening!!!",

The interior is a maze winding through a plethora of faux- stucco rooms with tons and tons (and tons) of kitschy random junk on the walls and nooks and shelves in a poor attempt to make it look 'authentic' or 'immigrant' Italian. It just seemed creepy/dirty/tacky. Sitting at a table looking into a nook, one could see dust and dead bugs. Waitstaff coughing... and food was definitely not great. Bread was like loaf bread and the olive oil/vinegar mixture tasted sour. Food is served family style - several ppl to a dish. We got stuffed shells which the menu boasted of sausage, etc.  It was pureed - like this unidentifiable baby poop goop. I was only able to eat the pasta shell; my stomach was literally turning - it was all just very gross and seemed super unsanitary.   We did try the brussel sprout/prosciutto side and that was the one redeeming thing of the entire visit, but not enough to save the experience.   Just ick. Felt dirty and old - including restroom. We don't be back; should have went to Olive Garden; not a fan of chains but it would have been better than Buca.",

This was not even mentioned from our waitress when seated. We ordered chicken parmigiana and with that being said, had to order $20 noodles to go with because \"at this place\" for some reason, does not serve pasta with their chicken parmigiana!  The chicken was cold- the pasta was cold. I ask for a refill On sweet tea it comes out with no ice. The food was very bland and the chicken parmigiana had a \"slice\" of melted cheese on top. This place is VERY pricey for the food you receive after claiming to be authentic Italian food, when clearly it is not!  The bread was also cold and hard.   My advice: Steer clear of this place if you are looking for decent food!",

REALLY, THIS IS ITALIAN??? cold bread??? 49 minute wait from salad until a simple pasta dish is unacceptable. both dishes were cold, tasteless and late, had to beg for extra bread. since when does an anti pasta salad, not cheap, have little to no meat?? maybe four olives and one was spoiled and pretty much set the stage for a horrendous evening of dinning. our cute little 16 year old waitress must NOT understand an ice tea refill should come with a fresh lemon. i got warm tea with my old smashed lemon on the bottom of warm glass. really, at $2.95 for a tea, no fresh lemon? $22 for a small spicy chicken rigatoni, looked like it was dropped in kitchen, all the noodles were busted, over cooked and dried out! chicken was like jerky, gawd!! hard to believe, save your time and money, this place is worthless for dinning!!!!",

It is a little overpriced even with coupons for the quality of food. The garlic knots and calamari are consistently tasty.

First we called to see if they were open and they informed us that they were. I told the woman on the phone that we were going to look over the menu and call right back. When we called back 3 minutes later the woman on the phone now had an attitude and with the most disgusting tone I've ever encountered she quickly told me that they were busy and weren't taking any more to go orders. I said I don't understand we just called and were told you don't close until 9 (it was 7:30 at the time) she said Oh, and placed on hold for 15 minutes just to come by and quickly dismiss us again with a \"yeah sorry we're not taking anymore orders!\". I've never eaten here and can't speak on the food but I will NEVER eat at a place that treats people this way, especially on a holiday.",

When pizza came it was covered in onions, and there were a smattering of small chopped olives and tomatoes..it looked like an onion tart. My kids refused...to eat this. We also had to go get our own tea and water, as our waitress forgot, she never refilled...we did that too.  Another visit: my daughter wanted to have her birthday dinner there with some friends. We made reservations months in advance and called day before to confirm. They were confused when we got there....didn't acknowledge we were waiting...and finally took us into the dining room. They tried to sit us at a too small booth that had a huge tear in the seat. NO. We finally got our seat at a table that was actually large enough for all of us...service was spotty.   on to the food. There is nothing spectacular about anything they serve. It tastes like chef boy rdee, or frozen dinners. Serving family style is nice, but it is akward to go with friends and do this.   Last visit 4 of us went....3 of us were sick for several days after...2 ended up at emergency room for IV...1 went to doctor for phenegren.....we will not be back after that experience for sure!!!",

I was so excited  about  dinner  tonight  because  linguini  and white clam sauce is one of my favorite  things. First  of  all  the waitress we had didn't  have a clue that this dish even existed, then when she got that figured  out I was VERYclear that I wanted white clam sauce. We wait for  30 minutes  for our food and when the linguini  comes out its  got lots of clams nut no white sauce.  Instead it's a runny broth at the bottom  of  the  bowl. I told the waitress that this is not what I ordered  so she went and got the manager.  When the manager  came out he explained  that this runny  brown  broth at the bottom  of my bowl was a white sauce. I told him to take dish back. Once again  we leave this place unhappy  and dissatisfied. We will never go back again. This food is just crap.",

Whether you're going with your family or on a date, it doesn't matter because the atmosphere of this place is unlike any other place you'll go.  Walking in, heck, even the outside of the place, you'll be amazed at the tackiness. Being half Italian, this place brings back a lot of memories of my grandmother's place. It's just so amazingly tacky, from the different types of rooms you can eat in, to the stuff on the walls & ceilings.   Buca is unique because of how they separate the seating. There are different types of themes for each room & each is very unique. I've sat in the Wine Room twice & filled wine racks cover the entire ceiling. There's also a pope room, with a spinning pope head in the middle of the table...yes...very weird. Also, I believe you have to reserve the booth located in the kitchen, but this is where you can watch the workings of the kitchen from inside of it.  The food here is great as well, with your normal favorites with some other odd creations. They have giant meatballs which are great for more than one person. You can order individual portions, but they're specialty is family style dining. So bring some people with you that have hearty appetites because you get a lot of food here.  This place may be a chain, but it's definitely a must visit if you're an Italian food fan...which I have no idea who isn't. From the uniqueness & tackiness of the place, to the great food you'll get to feed your whole party, you'll enjoy yourself & look forward to coming back soon.",

I have gotten take out meals and only had great things to say about this restaurant in the past.  The food was and is still good but not worth the treatment one now receives as a guest.    The wait staff had a total disregard and lack of respect for the patrons that was appalling.  Ours was poorly trained and had no back up or bus person.  Bread came out after the salad with no oil. By the time oil came, our bread was mostly gone.  We watched our desserts melt as we had neither spoons or plates to eat on.  I had dirty utensils dropped on me all while we froze to death after multiple requests to turn the air conditioning down.  After 4 requests a manager told us it had been done.  Within the hour it returned to meat locker status.  My church friends with arthritis were miserable and in pain due to the cold.  I had to go outside to try and warm up during my meal. I guess it was comfortable for the wait staff and those that may have been drinking alcohol.  For the rest it was a miserable an noisy environment.  It takes a lot for me to have to write this, but I was in tears thinking how my friend's Birthday celebration was ruined.  Needless to say  I will not be back nor will the groups I used to bring there.",

This restaurant is decorated with bunch of antique pictures and it has plenty of seats and tables inside. I bought two Groupon deals for this restaurant. Both times the services were great. The hostess or host will give you a kitchen tour. They will serve you bread in the beginning. We had the cheesy bread sticks and they were delicious. Nice and warm. Their portions are huge. The first time we had the spaghetti marinara and it was good. The second time we went we had Beppo\"s Soffici Cuscini and the small size was huge for two people. We did have a brownie sundae and it was big as my head. It was enough for four people to eat it. In my opinion the restaurant wasn't loud. A wonderful place for family to dine in. Without the Groupon deal it is pricey. A small size runs between 14-22 dollars.",

Our waiter Aaron, had a major chip on his shoulder, he was rude and even asked us if we had already paid for the drinks we had ordered at the bar, while waiting for our lovely table. We told him we had but he looked at us as though we were lying (really??). From there it only got worse, we had to remind them several times to sing happy birthday to my son-in-law and when they finally did, they brought out a candelabra for him to blow out (pretty chintzy). Food was mediocre at best! Never asked to take us through the kitchen, which they are known for and my son in law never really got to see the decor of any of the rooms(except the bar). I could go on and on about the rude service but the thing that really got me was when they brought the salad and plates out, the plates were so hot that the lettuce wilted and went limp and soggy, the minute it touched the plate! Please, don't waste your hard earned money at an establishment that doesn't give a rats *** about pleasing the customers but rather how many people they can heard in and out in an evening. Needless to say...I will NEVER go there again!!  Laura Disappointed diner'",

There are a few still ahead of you... Our name was called at 7:46 after 4 tables of 4 and a table of 6 were seated.  Anyone can take a reservation... Its the holding of the reservation that counts right? (UNHAPPY)  The food was OK, a small salad for the table, 2 shared dinners for 4, a side of pasta with a meatball & 1, $12 bottle of wine and 2 deserts nothing worth going out of your way for at a cost of almost $150.00. There was also 5 or 6 \"birthday/clapping\" sessions around us like at Applebees. The wait staff was nice, quick and good looking, but I'd rather have a slow, ugly waiter with good food myself. No hurry to go back there... ever.",

    "text": "I wasn't as impressed with Buca as I wanted to be. I'd always thought this place looked a little cheesy  from the outside, but after years of business, I finally decided to try it out with some friends who were celebrating a new job.   Bread and drinks were promptly brought to the table, along with a side of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping. We decided to start with the mixed green salad, and added Gorgonzola and prosciutto on the side. Typically when I think of mixed greens, I think of mesclun, arugala, frissae, and other greens. Though I wouldn't expect these particular greens to be served in an Italian restaurant, I don't understand why they considered this salad \"mixed greens\". The only thing mixed about this salad was the iceberg and red cabbage. I counted maybe five olives, and three pepperoncinis. The prosciutto and Gorgonzola were plentiful, though I'm not sure of the quality of prosciutto they use. It looked burnt and perhaps prepackaged like bacon bits. It was just okay as a whole. For our main dish, we got the large order of spicy chicken rigatoni. This is where the experience failed in my mind, as the chicken and peas did not taste fresh, and the sauce was lacking in depth and flavor. It just wasn't as authentic as I was hoping for.   Service was fine, but I think I'll be skipping Buca next time I need a fix for Italian.",

Giving the restaurant another chance, tonight I ordered Shrimp Fra Diavola. I made sure I asked for extra sauce(just in case). Needless to say I was disappointed again! Who puts 10 shrimp in a large pan of penne noodles that is supposed to feed at least 4 people(seriously I counted).

The place is overfilled with photos and artwork. They are nice photos, but its distracting almost on purpose. As if the food is not the real star of the show. It shows in the flavors. The service is great but again just too over the top with a way too long intro about every single portion of he menu. My server lost me towards the end. He was very attentive at first with his long spiel but then we barely saw him. All in all, it was ok. More focus on food and flavors and less on cliche. Its a standard italian restaurant for a standard meal. Nothing to remember",

Even the herbs in it seem quite fresh and complimentary.  someone also wrote that the atmosphere was loud and that they sang birthday songs a lot. Well to get around that my advice is to eat at home.

    "text": "Well  my friends this is one of the bad ones for me.  This use to be a family favorite for many years.  After doing a little shopping at the mall we would stop here to eat and gather our thoughts.  So here we go let me first say we have visited this restaurant on multiple  occasions and this is the worst time in the history for us. We were greeted upon entering but waited 4 minutes before being asked if we were dining in our picking up and order.  Why are we waiting to seated when no other family or patrons are waiting. Now off to our table the place was empty no more that 8 table in use. Yet we were cramped at a table and not a booth.  Humm now I am taking notes as this is not the kind of service I remember. So now I am ready to leave but the family wants to stay cause they enjoy eating. We order chicken alfredo and baked ziti and of course the short people requested ol favorite mac n cheese. Well long story short the waitress was the best thing at this restaurant.  My children's food had to be returned as it was cold as ice in the middle. My chicken alfredo was soupy/liquid sauce (you gotta be kidding me) must be a practice run on my order.  My husband baked ziti was drowning in marainera sauce which is a no no for those of us that know real Italian food. So to avoid being a meanie I will end this review like this.  The waitress was pleasant so I tipped her service but after being billed 100+ for food we didn't bother to take with us.  We will not be returning for any reason I could have feed my family twice and McCalisters for the cost of this on the run dinner.  No I would not advise anyone to visit but if you are up to the challenge go for it.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying their food is top notch, my favorite is baked rigatoni with whole wheat penne and I have the italian sausage replaced with ground beef. I wish they offered a small salad with the order instead of an addon but you definitely get your moneys worth in quantity. ALSO, if you are on the lookout there are ALWAYS buca coupons in the sunday papers, in valpak, and if you search for google apps on android. So if this was based on food I would give Buca a 5.  I took my Italian gf to Buca on her bday at her request and I must say the dining experience was the WORST either of us have ever experienced. We went during the week and they had maybe 8 different \"tables\" or groups dining in...they put us all in the same room (with the other 4-5 rooms EMPTY) and bunched us together with everyone. I'm literally sitting side by side with another group on a bench inevitably hearing every word of their conversation. Ideally you take your gf out on her Bday you want a private personable dinner where you can talk without hearing every word of someone elses conversation....that alone was bad when they had so much room in the restaurant.   On top of that we had the worst waitress ever, Cassandra.....she harassed us literally every 2-3 minutes asking us if the food was okay, talking about the weather, etc...she was interrupting us CONSTANTLY. My gf and I began being short with her so she would let us enjoy our dinner and she just didn't take the clue. On top of that the host who worked at the front door kept coming back and doing the same, CONSTANTLY. It's nice that people care that your meal is okay, but theres no need to ask us how our meal is literally every few minutes when I'm eating the same thing. My gf and I could not talk without the constant interruption.  Horrible experience dine in but we have continued to go back for their TAKE OUT....We generally will call 20-30 mins in advance, then showup to get our orders and its still not ready often we'll have to sit there and wait another 10-20 mins like they didn't start it until we got there. The food is so good, and they give you SOOOOOO much (leftovers for days) it makes it worth it but the customer service is very low in my opinion.",

When my friends were adamant about meeting here recently though, I grudgingly decided to try it again. The food was greatly improved and the decor was as fascinating as ever. As has been mentioned here before, the acoustics aren't very good so when it's packed, you have to yell to hear one another. But, they do still let you go thru the kitchen and even have a table in there for those who want to eat in it so I gotta give them kudos for that. The only real problem we had this time was that our server was super slow in getting to us and kept forgetting a plate for me because he thought there were 6 of us vs. the actual 7. He took so long one time, I got my own plate from a nearby stack and my friend went up to the bar herself to get her drink. He finally started getting better about making time for us after that though and even brought her out a humungous birthday dessert that we all shared while enjoying their singing. After this new experience, I would definitely go back.",

This is a family style place, so ordering dishes is either in small or large and shared amongst the diners.    Service was informal and familiar.  As we dined, others came to the bar and seemed to know the bartender and staff by name.  This is great and made me feel welcomed.  The food - I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio and it tasted like it was housed with food - a bad after taste.  The food was OK, not nearly the quality I expected for the price.  We ordered the Apple Gorgonzola salad, brussel sprouts, salmon, and Shrimp Florentine.  The salad was average and made with iceberg lettuce.  The menu said it was to be made with mixed greens.  However, the dressing was nice and light and the apples crisp.  The brussel sprouts were absolutely wonderful - cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The salmon was well-done and dry - I was not afforded the opportunity to request that the salmon cooked to medium well.  The Shrimp Florentine seemed to have precooked shrimp and alot of pasta.  There was less than an ounce of spinach.    These dishes totaled about $125.00.  Again, for the price if the meal, the quality of the food was not in alignment.  If in town again, I will likely give it another try.  As it was a popular place, it seems as though they may have some local favorites for dishes.",

We did not, but it wasnt a long wait.  They give you a tour of the restaurant when you are new, which was fun, but it also showed how empty the place was and how it was in need of repair...fairly depressing and not fun kitchy like I expected. We were sat in the freezing bar area and the waitress was nice and we made such to tip her appropriately.  We got the white sangria, and since the restaurant is family style- shared the proscuitto stuffed chicken and mashed potatoes. We also got a tiramisu (which was huge).  I knew what we were getting into, the family style meal- each meal is for 3 or 5 people (we obviously got the three size), but it was still kinda outrageous in pricing. Yes we got alcohol, and yes we got dessert, and yes we had some leftovers, but it really seemed like the amount we paid...over a hundred bucks plus tip...we should have had either amazing food or more of it, or an amazing environment, or it just should have been cheaper. I would have been okay if it was 80 even. I think if the family style meals were set up for 2 or 4 people, it would make more sense and bring more people in. I dunno, I won't be back because I really think you aren't getting a deal or a worthy experience and the food wasn't memorable.",

    "text": "While visiting Charlotte for the weekend, my small family of 2+ a toddler stopped in for dinner. We knew it was family style and were prepared to spend a little extra for some good Italian. We ordered the chicken limone and the penna alla vodka, and neither one disappointed! The chicken was perfectly cooked, crisped and served in a delicious lemon butter sauce, and the vodka sauce for pasta was also great. On top of that, I felt service was great too. The only star I'm missing here is for the health rating which was 91.5. I usually never eat anywhere below a 94 and only made the exception because I had been to a Buca's many years ago that I loved. If they could just get their health rating back up to a standard that matched the tastiness of the food and the service, they'd be a 5 in my book. Also for pricing reference, you have to purchase a minimum of 3 portions of anything you order, which was 92$ with tip for the chicken entree, pasta dish, and the brownie/ice cream dessert.",

    "text": "This place is an original.  They are very welcoming and give you a tour of the kitchen before you're seated.  The portions are enormous!  Everything is served family style.  It comes with service utensils and it's meant to be passed around the table and shared.  I was confused about the menu, as everything is ala cart.  I think it's supposed to mimic a big Italian family style dinner on your table.    The bread is soft and yummy.  I never had it with oil and vinegar; it was great.  I ordered the chicken parmigiana and you get no pasta with that.  So if you want pasta you have to order a side, which can get pricey.  For two people it was $70.    Now the pasta was rather bland and they didn't have the fresh cheese to grate on top.  My chicken was outstanding!  My dinner mate enjoyed her mountain of lasagna too.  All the food was much too heavy on the garlic, but the vegetables were fresh and the meats were of excellent quality.   The ambiance was eclectic with really unique, fun pictures everywhere.  A lot of thought went into this place.   Having said that, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that on this day, the place had a horrible odor about it.  To be polite I will just say... The ladies bathroom was really NOT GOOD!  I will not go into further details here, but I can mention the towel dispenser was broken.  To be honest, the bathroom made me want to flee.  The stalls in the restrooms is the reason they earned a mere three stars.  The commodes nearly made me sick.    You decide for yourself, but respectfully I will say that unless the ladies room and malodorous smell are attended to I would not go back there.  I can still say...  This place was a very unique dining experience.",

    "text": "So there I was, waiting for my family with my husband in the parking lot, checking the Yelp! reviews for this place while I waited. Honestly, due to all the bad reviews, I was quite apprehensive about eating here. When my family arrived, my mom and stepdad assured me that they had eaten here and that it was quite good, so that made me feel a little bit better.  The hostess led us into the kitchen, beginning a tour of the restaurant. At first I was a bit confused when she said, \"Follow me,\" and we ended up in the kitchen a few seconds later. Really? I mean a tour is nice and all, but I was HOWNGREH by this point and just wanted to sit down. Not hungry, HOWNGREH. Thankfully, the tour was mercifully short and we were led into a room filled with framed black and white photos of Italians and Italian-Americans, famous and non-famous, posters of movies starring Sophia Loren, paintings of the Pope, and not to be outdone, Christmas lights and Botticelli-style sculptures of naked women with G-strings painted on them. And of course, the traditional red-and-white checkered table spreads clothed the tables. Man, was I happy to see those tablecloths when we finally sat down.  So we ordered sangria for the whole table and chowed down on some garlic bread as music from La Rosa, Sinatra and the like played on the speakers. At one point one of us looked up and noticed that the ceiling had been lined with rows upon rows of wine bottles. Pretty neat!  I ordered the cheese manicotti, which I've never had before. I'm just gonna tell it like it is: the portions were un-fucking-believable. We ended up having to share each other's dishes, the portions were THAT huge. I gave my husband a couple of my manicotti. These gave me the satisfaction that ravioli does not. Well, since we were full we skipped on dessert, and as we were walking out past the bar, another staff member had us read a humorous little anecdote on the wall called The Italian Who Went to Malta (picture provided).  So... why does this place get so much hate? The service wasn't a problem. Our waitress, Sam, was friendly and quite chatty, and checked on us frequently. The food is amazeballs. The wait can be a little epic, but this isn't fast food. I think the bad reviews mostly come from people who don't understand Italian culture. It's vibrant, it's loud and it's passionate! I know because I have Italian family and Italian ancestry. Of course it can be loud, it's a family place. Of course the wait's long, any legit respectable chefs take pride in their cooking, especially if it's Italian food. But we wouldn't have it any other way. This is quality time for families and we like to have fun and converse between courses.  In conclusion, THIS is Italian cuisine and Italian culture done right. I want to go back and will recommend this place to anybody looking for some authentic Italian culture and food, because this is it.  A mangiare!",

Bring earplugs if you plan on dining in!  The food is served family style and the portions are large.  However, the quality has gone downhill in recent months.  The pastas are either over cooked or still raw.  The sauces have been skimpy and lack flavor.  The Alfredo used to be good but now it tastes like salty warm milk.  I ordered to go and wasn't made aware of an item not being available until I went to pick it up.  They had my phone number; I don't know why I wasn't called.",

They gave our food to the table next to us. Some kid grabbed the food and the server just laughed and tried to serve us food the kid put his hands in. We asked for the food to be remade. The calamari was burned but somehow the chicken was cold. The server then gave the wrong food to the wrong people. I got charged $60 for cold chicken and some cheese slices.

(Kids got spaghetti and meatballs and we got spicy rigatoni) We were already happy with our evening when the Assistant General Manager Norrese Ball (Norry) came over and asked if the kids could go into the kitchen and be chefs and help make dessert! The kids were ecstatic. They made a (delicious) brownie sundae! They were given aprons and then taken around the restaurant to have everyone autograph it! A good dinner turned into a great evening with such a fun memory!! Highly recommend this location not only for the food but the staff!",

This wasn't a problem at first, that's until it became a gathering place for the servers to complain. Not just complain but complain loudly at almost a yell. This topped with a rather bland meal, made for a bad experience. I gave the second star strictly based upon the decor.   Update. I was told to go to the website, go to the contact us section and write a review. A representative would contact me directly. I did exactly as asked on Wednesday . It is Saturday and not so much as an email. Seems par for the course. I'm left to assume this is due to one of two reasons. 1. They were simply blowing smoke. Or 2. They have a backlog of complaints and haven't gotten to me yet.  update #2: it has now been 11 days since I was told to contact corporate via their website. Still no reply. I'm just curious, why they would direct me to contact them if they intended on ignoring me. It's not as if I was asking for anything other than an apology. I guess the takeaway from this is this business doesn't care about customer experience. It might just be me, but when I spend $45 on lunch for 2, I would expect a pleasant experience.",

For the most part I enjoyed everything, but wasn't fond of a couple of things.  We had the family-style plates that were already pre-ordered for us.  First was the salad and bread.  Both were pretty good.  The salad I loved, the bread seemed a bit hard.  Next was the Salmon.  It was sort of bland.  Everyone commented on it and had to add salt to it.  Next was Chicken Parmesan.  That was fabulous!  Loved it!  The sauce was super tangy, and oh the cheese!!!  Next came Baked Ziti, was good, not anything I would order again.  Last was the Alfredo.  I was getting super full by this point, but still tried it.  Super tasty!  Last but not least, dessert.  Canoloi's and Cheesecake.  The cheesecake was amazing, the Canoloi's were a little thick and hard.  The filling was great.  Just seemed that the shells were not fresh.  Overall, pretty damn good and if I'm ever back in North Carolina, I would stop in again.",

He was very attentive and even joked with us. We started the meal with a bruschetta appetizer. It came in a large martini shaped glass with the long 5 to 6 inch strips of bread neatly positioned around the rim of the glass. The bruschetta mixture wa placed on the strips of bread to hold them in place. Great flavor  We then ordered 3 large dishes and a large anti pasta salad. The three meals were the traditional spaghetti and meatballs, penne San Reno (a delicious chicken pasta dish), and the Fruti di Mare (a great blend of seafood and a spicy marinara sauce). All were excellent. They had a good blend of pasta and sauce with the different meats. Great food. We had so much food left over to take with us. I feel like we will be eating for a week on it.",

From the Christmas-light-wrapped statues outside to photos of nuns running through the ocean inside, everything gaudy and over-the-top about Italian-American culture is embodied in the restaurant.  The experience starts with the escort to your table, which takes a detour through the kitchen (where there is also a booth table. In the kitchen.) and around by the Pope Room used for large parties (with a creepy wax bust on a rotating dais in the middle of the table).  Food is served family style. A \"small\" plate will feed 2 to 3 people. Everything is very tasty - I personally love the baked pasta dishes, the garlic bread, and their salads can be a meal by themselves, too. Not a place you want to come unless you are feeling hungry.  My only complaint is that their only Charlotte location is in Pineville and rather tough to get to for me. But when I'm in the area, a great place to stop!",

My wife is very selective and drinks only non-acidic Chard. Dustin recommended she try two tastes and recommended one which she loved AND it was the less expensive of the two. Food portion(small) was huge.  ALso, DO NOT miss the garlic mozzarella bread!! Just don't fill up on it before your meal arrives. We are not big eaters so we have enough left for another couple good meals.  We asked Dustin for some special treatment on the garlic and olive oil sauce and he nailed it (or rather he made sure the kitchen did.)  This is a nice unpretentious place and we will be back.  Entire staff was friendly and attentive.  Smiles all around, including us.",

    "text": "Last night my husband and I enjoyed our anniversary dinner at Buca. We love Italian food, and my husband has a very large appetite. This was my second visit and his first. We enjoyed the kitchy decor. My husband had a soda (driving), but I thought celebration. I began with a Cosmo Fizz. Delicious and strong. The bruscetta was creatively served and was good. The meatballs were as big as my mother's, tasty though plainer, and the tomato sauce is simple and delicious. It enables you to taste the food it is paired with. My husband enjoyed the chicken parmesan with a side of pasta and sauce. I ordered the chicken marsala with rosemary potatoes and broccoli for sides.  The chicken marsala was on the sweet side with almost a glaze feel to the sauce. It was ok. The potatoes and broccoli were yummy. To accompany my dinner I had a glass of Ste. Michelle reising. It was light, crisp, refreshing, and delicious. We ordered tiaramasu (sorry about the spelling) for desert. While it was tasty the lady fingers had not been soaked enough making it a bit dry. Ashley was our server. She was very friendly, thoughtful, and attentive, and knowing we were celebrating our anniversary she did not rush us. Overall a good experience.",

The chicken used to be prepared by being hammered flat and served with the lemone sauce on top.   When my food arrived the chicken was the same as if you cooked a boneless chicken breast.   There was very little sauce on it.  The side of spaghetti was very small and not much marina sauce on it. The side salad was very good. My server was excellent. I never did complain but, swore Buca off my go to restaurants for a while. The booth right beside mine had a mother, her little boy and grand parents.  They allowed the boy to talk loudly throughout the meal and he kept saying, \" Mom your food looks yucky!\" Come on Mom this is not your house. Your disregard for other peoples enjoyment is rude.  Next time go to McDonald's where all the kids are screaming and your son will blend in. I should have asked to move but, didn't.  Wish I had.",

    "text": "I have to give Buca di Beppo props on the ambiance they create.  You cannot find another restaurant like it (or if there is one - I am not aware of it).    For those that are not familiar with Buca di Beppo, it is an Italian restaurant that serves family style meals.  Any dish you order is meant to be split between members of your party - so if you have a party of 2-4, you really only need to order 1-2 dishes for the party.  Me, being the picky eater that I am, I would rather order my own dish than share.    At least with this experience, did not have the best server.  He did not seem to be too enthusiastic with his job.  He was willing to split the bill among the five people in our party, but one person in our group ordered an alcoholic beverage and the price of her drink was split amongst the people in our party.    They might only do this if there are people in your party that have not eaten at Buca di Beppo, but when they take you to your table, they walk you through the kitchen (which has a table for patrons to eat their meals at).   The only plus side of going here for meals.",

I expect she was a stand in as later another hostess took over and we were seated. Then  the problem started. We ordered a bottle of wine and two draft beers. Waiter returned to tell us the tap was dry on our option of beer would we like another option. (well first its Friday night how do you run out of Bud Light at 7:30 on Friday night) -- then we were told they had Miller light on Draft..... 15 min later ....know miller light was out (Friday night). Dan (our server was the king of excuses). Then he offered Coors light.... (but said if we don't have that what do you want from the bottle). I stated bring me a Bottle of Bud Light and a list of what is in stock. Got the  first Bud light after Salads had arrived and we were on the second helping. We asked for bread... 15 min later it arrives (I kid you not). He took our entree order and second round of drinks. The food was fine. The drink issues ran all night. The service was awful. The table beside us turned twice while we sat an waited for various items. This was my son in laws birthday. TOOK 30 min for his ice cream / happy birthday song to arrive. Dan was in the weeds all night ... no one really helped him. We were very disappointed. $158.13 bill for four-- sorry I expect much better service! Did I say we didn't even leave the restaurant until 10:30pm 3 hours for a simple order. Oh and on the way out, I notice the tap, BUD LIGHT proud as you please....someone just didn't want to change the keg. Really?",

    "text": "We originally headed to Olive Garden for lunch while visiting the Charlotte, NC area. After finding that Olive Garden uses latex gloves during food preparation, we had to change our plans due to a latex allergy one our family members have. We called Buca and were assured they were latex free.   What a great experience we had. From the friendly staff to the perfectly prepared food. Although not widely publicized, Olive Gardens food is \"heat and eat\", meaning your chef uses a microwave oven. Buca food was freshly prepared, served hot and cooked perfectly! The prices were inline with competitor chain prices but the quality was miles ahead.   The restaurant was clean and decorated in that vintage style Italian home feel.  Being a Brooklyn born Italian, I have been in many Italian houses and trust me, they have the decor correct.  This is not meant to beat up Olive Garden, or compare Buca to a family owned Bensonhurst or Bay Ridge Brooklyn Italian restaurant, but to give heads up for meal options when traveling.  I normally would not rave about a chain restaurant, but this location deserves to be recognized.",

She is in town from Boston and I wanted her to have a no worries dinner with no clean up.  I made reservations for 6:45 pm a week in advance.  I called the day before  and confirmed my reservations and asked should I order my food in advance and the lady told me that would not be necessary.  I said thanks and looked forward to a nice turkey feast for two with Mom.  We went shopping at the mall and worked up a good appetite for our feast.  When I arrived we were seated and the first thing the waitress said was they were out of turkey and pumpkin pie. I said excuse me, I have reservations and I was told yesterday I did not need to order in advance.  She said she was sorry but all day people were ordering turkey and they did not plan for so many people to order turkey.  I said really on Thanks Giving you did not think people who made reservations would order turkey!  Really!  Now I am starting to get frustrated because of the weak excuse for  ruining my 2016 Thanks Giving dinner.  Long story short, one of the mangers came out and said they had turkey but no pie and the waitress misunderstood what he told her.  I say \"BS\" they tried to screw me and when I was upset they did not want a scene and coughed up my turkey.  As I left 90 minutes later I showed my Mom the kitchen and guess what there was a big platter of turkey on the counter.  Please steer clear of this horrible customer service and shady business.  By the way, there was no compensation for the confusion.  Need I say more??",

It's a kitschy, tacky, wild and funky place, and the food is huge, plentiful, and delicious. The prices aren't bad, either.   I like the family-style service, although it's easy to over-indulge because everything is so good and so in your face.   It can get a little busy, so sometimes the servers seem a little overwhelmed. The food can take a while to come out, so although the atmosphere would be great for kids, if your little kidlet is impatient, I would recommend finding somewhere else to go on busy evenings.   They also offer curbside service if you aren't feeling the atmosphere, so order ahead of time, and they'll bring it out to you.",

First the good part: I ordered the baked rigatoni with meat sauce and hot Italian sausage. It was excellent -if like me you like strong flavors and spicy both- nothing I'd expect from a chain restaurant. The lunch portion was huge, too much in fact. that's it for the good.  Service was absolutely dismal for no good reason. It was neither busy nor a late hour for lunch. I think the dinner prices are very high for Southern Italian style pasta dishes, especially considering we're in Charlotte and I think their idea of \"family dining\" makes life easier for the cook but does nothing for the customer.   My idea of fun dining is exactly the opposite, I want to taste as many different things I can, not pig out on a mound of carbs.",

Mangiamo....",

This actually made date night kind of interesting and in a way fun trying to agree something my girlfriend and I are going to share. We eventually ordered the small portion Shrimp Florentine and it came out pretty good. It really works out that thier small portion feeds about 3 people.   I must admit the decor inside is a bit overwhelming. I get that they're trying to play up the Italian theme but a bust of Pope John Paul 2 is quite tacky sitting at the dinner table, It made me chuckle really.   All in all I'll come back maybe next time with a larger crowd so we can try a few different items. Service was good food came out fairly quickly and our waiter was very helpful and really made our evening.",

    "text": "This place is so wonderful! I want to give a review that details every step of the way. I have actually eaten at di peppo twice and each time I was completed delighted. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is enchanting. I love the separate rooms and the decor in each. My favorite is a toss up between the wine room and the pope's table. IDK but it is something about sitting at a round table with familiar faces, pictures of the pope and wine!  My hands down favorite aspect of this restaurant is the option to eat in the kitchen. Its soooo romantic. Your server dedicates time and care to your entire eating experience- and you are literally in the kitchen watching the chefs and cooks prepare meals. Its an open kitchen concept.   You \"should\" receive a tour of the entire restaurant before or after you have completed your meal... depends on your server and how busy they are.   The FOOD: its gigantic. Its ginormous!! and its delicious. As a New Jerseyan I like to fancy myself as a Italian red sauce (gravy) connoisseur. They have hit the mark. The sauce tastes fresh, the garlic is visible and the arrabiata is not just spicy its FLAVORFUL.   How to order: this is a family style restaurant. A real family style restaurant. Meaning- they are not tapas style large plates. They are legit placing several chicken breasts on one plate smothered in sauce and cheese. BE MINDFUL.... you are not likely to finish you entire meal as a family of four and definitely not gonna finish if you order a plate to yourself.  Overall I really enjoy this restaurant. My wife and kid were able to enjoy themselves and I am able to indulge in fancy fresh red sauce. TRY THEM.",

We showed up at 6:30 and the girl at the to go area said they are still waiting on one more pasta. So at this point we are thinking maybe it will be about 10 more minutes. We ordered 2 small pastas and bread with olive oil and the special seasoning. We waited over an hour for our to go order!!! After an hour my husband went back up to the stand and asked her for the status. She went to the kitchen and came back with our order. It was almost as if it was just sitting there. What's really annoying is that my husband asked her if the bread and olive oil and seasoning was there and she said yes. We went back to the car and noticed it was not there! So he had to go back inside and wait in line to tell her about it. She comes back with just a container of olive oil. He asks her about the special seasoning. She makes an excuse and says something about how they are in a shaker and can't get it out. Really? I find that hard to believe. I've been to the restaurant before and see it's just a regular shaker and you can unscrew the top. We were so annoyed at that point we just left. It's ridiculous that we waited an hour.   What's even worse was that we ordered a small lasagna and it was so tiny. There was more cheese than the actual lasagna. I also did a create your own small pasta. I asked for onions in it. Although, there were onions in it, they were raw! It was as if they made it and forgot to add it in there so they added it last minute.   Just ridiculous considering we spent almost $60.",

The \"Colossal Brownie Sundae\" (which is FREE for Buca Club members during their birthday month) is truly colossal -- there is no way 2 normal people can finish it. The presentation in an over-sized Manhattan glass is genius! You just have to grin and say \"OMG\" over and over. That said, this particular experience was dampened somewhat by two (2) issues: (1) the lasagna, which we love, has significant amounts of burnt meat detracting from its otherwise wonderful taste and (2) the booth at which were seated had a HUGE tear in the seat with stuffing coming out...no one should be seated there and we came at 1:30pm...there was no one else in the room where we were seated so it wasn't like there wasn't plenty of available seating.",

    "text": "Where to start...... Had reservations for 8 but they somehow didn't have it in their system even though I had confirmation on my phone as proof to show them. Once seated it took 20 minutes just to get our drink orders at the same time I ordered mozzarella sticks which took 50 minutes to receive after asking numerous times where they were at.   Our food took 1 hr and 50 minutes to get to our table. Once the food arrived we asked for knifes and guess what. Our waitress stated they were out of knifes, not sure how you run out of knifes do you mean your employees didn't wash the knifes and prepare for the dinner service. During the wait they did not come to the table and refill any of the drinks and we had to eventually ask a manager to get us refills.   I was there with my wife and four daughters one being 4 months old. During the dinner the employees came out 3 times  and sung happy birthday at the top of their lungs which startled my youngest daughter and made her scream and cry. This place is not kid friendly and I highly do not recommend bringing them to this restaurant.   It took so long for us to get our food that my wife wasn't able to eat and had to go sit in the car with my four month old because she wouldn't calm down from employees singing like they were in a orchestra. I then asked for to go boxes and they literally brought us out 12 small boxes because they were out of the regular boxes. I then asked to speak to a manager and I was informed that the manager would no longer speak to me.   Want to talk about the absolutely worse service ever. From the moment we walked in the door it was a absolute nightmare. Staff and management were horrible, rude and unprofessional.  *****Follow up********* I have no desire to visit your establishment again even if the food was free. I also have no desire to deal with the management of that location again considering how unprofessional and poorly they handled my dining experience. I'll keep going to Olive Garden after all I've never had poor service at that establishment.",

Not exactly what we wanted to see followed by the tour of kitchen. The kitchen was so dirty. The dining rooms were dirty. We get to our table in the bar. Which was also dirty and cold. The booth had trash in them. The floor was so slick with oil or something. Our waitress came quickly and was very attentive to our requests. We ordered a simple fettuccine Alfredo. It was horrible. So i asked for fresh garlic. It comes over and smells like old garlic. I couldn't added enough black pepper and seriously nothing changed the taste. Listen, I'm not one to complain to a manager EVER. But I felt the need to. I'm sure he knows but don't seem like he cares. I told him about the smell of the garlic and he said oh that's the way is it. I said I've ordered fresh garlic and that is not what is smells like. I said the noodles tasted like they came out of a package or box. It was horrible. He comped our meal which he didn't have to do. But i don't think we will be back. I really hate to be that way but corporate needs to make changes.",

I guess since we didn't drink she didn't want to serve us when the waiters came to fill our glasses they were somewhat detached our appetizers went to another table while we were the only ones sitting in the area without any food.  This is a nice place to come to eat but the staff sucks.. Definitely won't be coming back here again u guys SUCK also was mad that we used a birthday coupon JEEZ.",

I wouldn't recommend this place for a romantic evening, but it is great for large families, parties, and two or more guests. I have yet to have a dish that I didn't like.   I recommend getting your bread when you sit down if it is crowded because it may take a while to get your food. I have been ere several times and my favorite dish is the eggplant Parmesan one. There is also a really good seafood pasta, but you'll more than likely want to add salt because it is a very light dish.",

    "text": "In my opinion, this place is only one star ahead of Olive Garden (which I don't care for )  in terms of the quality of the food... but it is pricier than OG. (Because of the price-point, I would acutally rate this place 2.5 stars instead of 3.)   It is your typical Italian-American corporate chain cuisine. If you are hungry and want to find something \"nicer\" than the Olive Garden but not on the level of gourmet authentic Italian dining, this is an ok choice... especially if you are a family with lots of hungry mouths to feed.    If it were totally left up to me, I would not choose to go here. Ever.  However, we have a lot of good friends who really like this place (??!!), so on occasion, I will suck it up and take one for the team.    One problem from my perspective is the \"family style\" dining.  Typically, I am much pickier than my dining companions and I feel like I have to settle for something that I would not order if it were just up to me.  (And the same is True in the reverse, my dining companions try to find something to order that I'll actually eat).   But, they do have enough options that I can find a chicken or seafood option. There are also a couple of selections of baked pasta that do not include meat sauce.   When I eat \"Italian\" food, I typically like to enjoy a glass of wine or two. As expected for a place like this, the wine selection is not very good and is  more overpriced than the typical restuarant wine mark-up.    Even with a coupon and not ordering the most expensive things on the menu, I generally end up paying more than I feel this place is worth. I'd prefer to take my business to a smaller locally owned restuarant any day - and especially when it comes to Italian food.   I have only been a few times, but on each visit the service was a-ok.  The wait can be a little long depending on what time you get here, but the staff tries to make up for it by being super-friendly.",

Firstly, I knew there was something wrong with the server when we arrived. She just seemed...off...or high. She was very awkward and kept flirting with my date. Not only that, but she completely ignored me as if I wasn't sitting right there.   To make matters worse...much worse, our yummy carbonara had a hair in it. A nice long blonde hair. I was done. I pulled it out and showed my date, he looked at it and told me to just get rid of it. Ok, I did, and I stopped eating. He kept eating lol, until...I found another hair!!!!!!!! Yuck!!!! There is nothing worse than someone else's hair in your food. The night was ruined for me, and we both stopped eating, I never speak up when I am unhappy about something. I am just naturally a friendly, non-confrontational girl, but I felt like I had to say something! No one should have to eat food with hair in it, and have to pay $19 for it.   Alas, my date didn't want to make things more awkward since  out server seemed to be on the verge of an emotional breakdown. So, I kept quiet against my better judgement. She later returned with the check, which was wrong, and claimed that she would have to pay the difference out of her pocket if she tried to change it. Confused! Then she asked us to do the survey and give her 5 stars. Ha! I just started laughing, I was sure this entire night was a joke.   She literally said, as she knelt down to our table and clasped her hands as if in prayer (I couldn't make this up guys) I'm new here, could you please give me 5 stars, for the good of humanity, and for all those people without jobs in the world.) This was entertaining. Then, she proceeded to take my dates credit card and flirt with him some more! She touched his chest and asked if he had any brothers. Holy...cannoli... get me out of here! I was happy to leave, and planned to never return. That woman just creeped me out. Sorry Buca, a previous visit was much better than this one.",

Stopped by the mall on the way home the other night, and somehow ended up at the end of the parking lot in a dead end right in front of Buca Di Beppo.  Not sure what drove me into this location tonight, as I have only heard of the GINORMOUS portion sizes, and we were in the mood for something very light, and did not want anything real heavy. I know, this is Italian and everything is heavy, but we decided to give them a try since the parking lot was not nearly as full as normal.  (That could be good, or that could be bad) Anyhooo...we felt like an adventure none the less.  Since this was our True \"first visit\" we felt in order to take the tour....through the maze, into the kitchen, (hey look someone is actually eating in the kitchen) and onto the myriad of other rooms, finally locating our table in a room, with just one other \"festive\" couple.  Apparently a few servers had been cut, so there were a few questions as to who actually had our table.  One would think that was bad, however we did have at least three servers attend to our needs at the very beginning.  Of course, by now, you know I drink water, and my better have always has sweet tea. The drinks were quickly presented and we placed our very huge order of just the Mozzarella Cheese.  We had the complimentary basket of bread, with Olive Oil / Balsamic Vinegar, to help soak up the very tasty Marinara Sauce left over from the Cheese Sticks.  The portion sizes were reasonable for the price, and as expected, it was enough to feed both of us, especially the 2 sections of bread.  This will be on the list for us to visit later on, we when are hungry.  Service was fast and friendly.   NCFoodGuy",

I already know growing up as an Italian-American from New Jersey to not judge Italian food too critically to be fair, but I do expect to get what I pay for. Baked ziti is supposed to have a lot of cheese and sauce. We paid 32.00 for a box of ziti with mozzarella sprinkled on top and maybe a spoonful of ricotta cheese when I complained the excuse I was given was that a lot of people don't like a lot of cheese in it. Isn't that what baked ziti is? And the veal was dry. I did complain and was apologized for it but was not asked to see the manager until we were about to leave. Not good customer service. I stupidly let it go. Not all of it was bad but I was very disappointed. :(",

    "text": "This place leads you to believe that it is authentic immigrant Italian food and it does not come close.  First, the bread is dense, mushy, cold, white bread . . . much like Wonder Bread. The garlic bread is even worse, just very greasy white bread that made my Italian husband feel sick after only one piece. The olive oil is old and bordering on rancid.   The salad is disappointing but edible.   The shrimp florentine was tasteless, and the shrimp appeared to be seared (but not cooked through enough) on a flat grill in some mystery grease. There was a foul taste and odor on the shrimp that seemed like spent oil from the deep fryer, or even worse -- could it be meat fat? (caution vegetarians!) There was some cheap tasteless oil and no sign of sauteed garlic to give it some taste. I tried squeezing the lemon from my drink and grinding some pepper on it, but it was beyond hope. If I wasn't very hungry and in a hurry, I would have sent it back.   My husband had a small personal plain cheese pizza and was charged more than what you would pay for a large cheese pie at any quality pizzeria. He said it was terrible. The cheese was awful and there was too much of it. Again, we were very hungry and running out of time so we just ate what we could and let them throw out the rest.   There is nothing Italian about this place. If you are accustomed to good authentic Italian food this place will assault your tastebuds, drain your wallet, and argue that they are serving authentic immigrant Italian food and you don't know what authentic and quality is. Don't waste your breath trying to give constructive criticism-- they can't handle it and won't act on it.   Create Your Own Pasta - tasteless sauce, chosen components missing, pasta glued together. POOR  Eggplant Parmigiana - it's not parmigiana - diced tomatoes instead of sauce, a small amount of lousy cheese, tasteless. POOR  Eggplant Parmigiana - after asking for sauce and cheese without the diced tomatoes - not much better. It's clear that they cannot produce a decent marinara sauce. POOR  Desserts: huge, overpriced, unimpressive.   We've tried to like this place because the waitstaff in the bar area (Matt) was great but after being grossly overcharged for huge portions of poorly made food that is just somewhat edible and not enjoyable, we give up.",

Not only did they come out with a piping hot replacement, but they boxed up the original spaghetti to have later. This was after they treated us with a free appetizer (prior to our meal, just because) and clinched it with a free dessert. Honestly, we would have been happy with them reheating the meal, but instead they went beyond what was expected. Their manager, Dustin, was amazing and manages an equally great team!!

It was unbelievably greasy (the greasiest pizza I've ever seen) and was undercooked despite the long wait time. When you peeled the cheesy scab like structure back you could see the undercooked dough. It was the most hideous pizza I've ever had. sad!",

I have frequented this establishment numerous times but the only reason I keep going back is because of Ashley who is the Assistant General Manager and Kasi who is my favorite server.  Between the two of them they always go above and beyond to make the experience more memorable for myself and my family.  Ashley is a very genuine and caring member of management who ensures that everything is to our liking.  Kasi is a dedicated and extremely helpful person who strives to deliver an exceptional experience. Once again, thanks to both of them who give Buca a great name!!",

    "text": "My wife and I have gone here for several years (at least the last 12 years). This was our go-to place for celebrations including birthdays, our anniversary, successes at work, and anything else in-between. Depending on the circumstance, we usually eat at this location roughly 4-6 times a year. We both feel like the dining experience has gone down significantly in the last couple of years. Prices have increased, portion sizes and quality of the food have gone down, and the service seems a lot less enthusiastic.This is tremendously heartbreaking. After our experience tonight, I don't think we'll be back for a while.   The restaurant wasn't terribly busy, but we were seated in a small room with a large party of high school-aged girls (twelve girls plus parents). Why they would sit just two people in a their smallest dining room with very exuberant teens is a mystery, especially since other parts of the restaurant were much more sparsely seated. Buca is rarely quiet, but this particular seating arrangement was puzzling. Why stick us in a room  that packed? It made for a pretty loud and jarring dining experience.   Aesthetics aside, the food wasn't great. The calamari was virtually flavorless. The sauce and pasta for our main dish was decent, but the chicken in our meal tasted and looked like the value-brand, microwaveable chicken you can buy next to the lunch meat in they grocery store. It was pretty disgusting and was definitely not a good cut of meat  The service was also lackluster. Our waitress seldom returned to our table. She only offered to refill our glasses once... after we had asked for the check!   I wish I could say that this was a one-off bad experience, but it has sadly become common in the last couple of years. I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants anyway, but I've always told others that Buca was the exception. That's not the case any longer. There are many Charlotte/Pineville/Fort Mill/Rock Hill mom-and-pop Italian restaurants and local venues that serve better food at a cheaper price using better ingredients.",

Upon arrival we were told they were behind schedule. which was understandable. Once we were led to our table in the back room next to their fire exit door. The room was chilly and there was a draft coming from the door. Everyone had their coats on. After waiting for quite awhile for our appetizers we discovered we had no utensils or napkins. Once we got them, our drinks came in plastic cups. The waiter told us their dishwasher was broken. We ordered spaghetti and meatballs, we were told they would have to give us linguini because they ran out of pasta. I requested red wine vineger on the side and were told they didnt have any. How does a restaurant run out of pasta, red wine vinegar, have a broken dishwasher and forget to bring complementary bread basket? Next year we will not be coming here for sure. It was unbelievable.",

We made reservations and were seated quickly and then the service \"four corners\" started.  Our salad was delivered and we had to ask twice for plates and silverware.  5 minutes staring at our salad bowl and they finally brought some.  We had to ask for refills, bread plates and we finally went and grabbed our own plates and olive oil.  The salad and bread were tasty. The entrees were usually good with the exception of the Alfredo pasta was cold, pasta not cooked enough and needed salt.  The chicken in pesto cream sauce was outstanding.  Overall a disappointing dinner with the food average and service horrible.  Next time we may should look else where.",

The reason I am deciding to give it 4 stars is because I felt a certain way about the cleanliness of the restaurant seating/bathroom. They sat us in a booth off to the side, which was nice for privacy, but when I turned around to look at the pictures, I noticed all around the top of the booth was a lot of dust, and it had straw wrappers sitting there. It wasn't just a small amount of dust either, so you can tell it hadn't been cleaned in a long time. The food was really good and my family enjoyed it, but when we were heading out my kids had to use the restroom. Once we opened the door we had to watch our step because there was a \"caution when wet\" sign that had fallen over and was just laying there. Anyone not paying attention could have tripped and hurt themselves. About 2 minutes of being in the bathroom a worker came in to use the restroom. Although she saw the sign she didn't bother to pick it up. Again I love this place. Just need to be dusted more often.",

We chose the large tossed salad to start and then three big entrees to share. Yep, that was probably too much food. Huge platter of Eggplant Parmesan. Big tray of cheese manicotti. Ginormous vat of shrimp fettuccine Alfredo. All really delicious, all really big servings. We took a shedload of it home with us.  As for the desserts, they are ALSO sized to share. The brownie sundae, by itself, is enough for five people. And we also had what we thought was going to be ONE canoli but was actually three of 'em. Oy, my tummy hurts.",

The food was really good - the lasagna was great, the salads were fresh and plentiful, and somehow the cookies disappeared???  But what really set this restaurant apart was their management and service. We had some confusion around the order which was placed (by someone not on the trip) and we thought we were shorted some dishes. They quickly made up the two \"missing\" pans of pasta and delivered within about 20 minutes or so, just as we were trying to call to let them know we really didn't need it.  As it turns out, we had a copy of the original order, not the final order, which had been reduced to exactly what they had provided.  We are a small non-profit group and the extra $400 would have been a big bite into our budget, especially since it turned out to be our mistake.  The manager very generously told us they would donate these pans of pasta to a local place if need.  So, great food and service, but AWESOME service and values.",

    "text": "Worst service at any restaurant we have ever been to. Took 30 minutes to be seated even though we had a reservation , then it took another 20 minutes after we were seated to get service.  Our food took another 25 minutes to arrive at the table, and then was served cold! And they brought the wrong salad order.  We complained to our server, who then gave us a long explanation that they were short-handed because no one wanted to work because they had money from their tax returns. Also one of the employees had been killed in a car accident the week before, so those who did show up to work were depressed.   OK, we just asked for different food that was at least warm, and she again reiterated, they were short handed so it would probably be at least another 20 minutes. We said, we just want hot  food.  17 minutes later food arrived back \"warm\" not hot. We ate a bit and asked for to-go boxes. Another 10 minutes and we got to-go boxes and the check. We had decided not to say anything to the manager, because of the employee death, we were just going to pay and go. As we were walking out the manager asked us if everything was ok, so we responded and told her about the negative experience. She literally shrugged and said the same thing the server did about taxes, the car accident etc.  never once did she apologize, or offer a coupon, or free dessert etc.  She clearly did not give a damn. We will not be going back there, and none of our friends and acquaintances are like to go back there either after hearing of our experience.   Still no response from management...",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying the staff was EXTREMELY friendly and sweet! From the minute we walked through the door we were greeted nonstop. We sat down immediately on a Saturday night. The experience was exciting for our kids. Our waitress Megan was super sweet. We ordered a few items that weren't available and the manager Shauntelle was so apologetic that she offered to replace it on her. The food is family style. And you already know what to expect. It's good enough for the price, not fancy, but consistent. Perfect atmosphere for a family with 3 children. I highly value good customer service. We will be more than happy to bring our family back to this restaurant! Thanks for your excellent service !!",
