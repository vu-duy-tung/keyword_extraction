As more and more \"chain restaurants\" appear on the horizon, there are always places to eat, but are those the places you WANT to eat at? Not always. I was in town on business and once again Yelp gave me my dinner spot - this time it was Toucan Louies. What an amazing Mediterranean salad!!  The dressing is tasty and loaded with dill. It was luscious. The veggie hummus sandwich was a taste treat as well. I ate here 2 out of my 3 nights in town, and I'm making this my \"GoTo\" food stop whenever I'm back in Charlotte. C'mon west side - support this place - you'll be glad you did!!!  The coffee is awesome too!!!",

We have tried their espresso drinks and breakfast and lunch sandwiches as well. Definitely get the one with goat cheese or their homemade pimento cheese. Their toasted roll is SO good. My only constructive criticism is that both their almond milk and coconut milk lattes were not good. The coconut milk latte was overwhelmingly coconut-y and greasy. The almond milk latte tasted off and like it was a day or two old. But this was also during soft opening so I'm willing to retry!",

I got the pimento cheese steak and my boyfriend the ham, egg, & cheese on bagel. I really liked the cheese steak! Nicely toasted french bread with real roast, similar to a French dip. The pimento really makes it! But it's not too heavy either. My boyfriend really liked his bagel sandwich as well, and said the bagel was especially good -- not too doughy nor chewy. What I thought really makes this place shine is their little marketplace, where you can shop a nice little selection of local honey, coffee, tea, soda, and other knickknacks. They also have really cool chips, like yuca chips and plantain chips. Also great coffee and lattes! I got the dirty chai latte and liked the spice so much I bought the tea mix. Service is very nice and prompt. Also, they have a really good  emphasis on environmentally friendly practices -- compost, recycling, etc. Finally, they have a 15% discount on different days of the week for college employees, bank employees, etc... I thought that was a nice touch to celebrate local workers. I'm glad Toucan Louie's is expanding to a second location! Would like to return during a future visit to Charlotte.",

On the weekend they have a full menu of breakfast items including french toast, benedict, beakfast meats, etc.  We had the Cuban sandwich and the jerk chicken salad sandwich which were tasty and fresh for lunch.  A few days later had the Gouda, egg, and avocado sandwich and the egg/meat/home fries for breakfast which was outstanding. I highly recommend this place.",

Nevertheless was we entered what is clearly an old filling station repurposed as a small cafe.   The staff was friendly and inviting.  The bacon,  egg and cheese biscuit was yummy with the biscuit being quite buttery and flaky.   My daughter enjoyed the blueberry pancakes and bacon.  A real find!   Thank you for a wonderful breakfast.",

My fiance brought me on a Sunday morning and we ordered breakfast food, but the deli area is open all day long and serves a variety of sandwiches too. Parking is minimal, but there is a dirt lot out back that we parked in and didn't have any issues.  I ordered the Twisted Goat breakfast sandwich, which is spinach, egg, roasted red peppers, mushrooms and goat cheese on a roll. If you like goat cheese, you will like this sandwich. The cheese is very creamy (local!) and blends well with the other breakfast flavors. They had also just started offering a combo deal that included their homefries and a coffee. The homefries were also great! They were big chunks of potato roasted with peppers and onions, like a cheesesteak :)  I will definitely be returning!",

The place wasn't busy at all so we were served quickly. We ordered a bacon egg and cheese sandwich, pimento cheese sandwich, Toucan Fogger, and a vanilla iced coffee. I loved my pimento cheese sandwich. I asked for it melted, it was delicious. The tomato and lettuce were fresh. The bread wasn't over toasted. The BEC sandwich was good but could have been made better of the bacon was crispy, my husband ended up taking all of it off because it was just fat. The toucan fogger smoothie is good and I liked the ice coffee.",

It was not busy at all when I went today (prob from holiday still) and thoroughly enjoyed talking with Marc, the owner. Such a humble man with amazing products...literally everything is local and he is not bragging about it. Its just a matter of fact that this is what he is about, so cool. Coffee roasted there and peanut butter...so good! Marc roasts all of the coffee himself and he loves doing it. How can you not want to support this establishment? Such good vibes. Excellent breakfast sandwich, compliments to the nice chef. I am already obsessed with it and have mapped it out for my commute to and from work...oh and the prices are so affordable. Latte and egg cheese bacon (crispy and was actually crispy and perfectly to my liking) for less than $8. I am a huge fan and with me living 8 mins away on the west side, I am excited to see this business grow as the West takes off with new growth. A small, local business win!!",

    "text": "Toucan Louie's is the type of place that the West End needed, and frankly I'd like to see more of around Charlotte. Market places with deli counters that get food and atmosphere right become hangouts - and I'm so glad we're within 10 minutes of this place. It's located a bit north of Five Points, and my only gripe about the location is the lack of parking (6 parking spaces total, although there is a gravel lot out back... not sure if it was okay to park there, but that definitely didn't stop us, nor did we get towed haha)...  Walking in, you're met with a super bright interior and a good number of tables. The market area is lined with coolers and shelves of local products, mostly NC, some even donate to charities like the chips! The menu is extensive and features ALL local made products. Everything from the meats, to the cheeses, to breads, to pickles, to the people sitting there reading the paper. It's all local. I ordered the That's Gouda breakfast sandwich which had ham, avocado (side note, I'm not able to say that word without thinking about the video of the little boy opening his Christmas present), gouda, and some other yummies. We were upsold to a combo (new!) which included coffee and homefries. The meal was affordable, filling, and most of all absolutely delicious. The homefries had peppers and were seasoned beautifully, it was just great.   Because of the market aspect and the rest of the menu that I've still yet to try, I absolutely cannot wait to return!",

Hubby had a cheeseburger that came out on a nice Kaiser roll that was toasted. I also had a side of mac and cheese.

The Spinach Sweet Potato salad tastes phenomenal and is the perfect balance of ingredients; you can tell the spinach is fresh & clean, the small diced sweet potato bites are prepared perfectly, bacon is always a welcomed addition to anything I have on my plate, the candied pecans add a touch of sweetness, and the goat cheese adds just enough creaminess and moisture that I didn't even need to use the balsamic vinaigrette that the lovely worker recommended. If you really feel like taking it to the next level order 8oz of the Shrimp Salad for only $4.95. Completely worth it!   If you're in the mood for a healthy pick me up, give the Greendrink 12oz juice a try! They make it right in front of you so you can see all the whole fruits and veggies going into your drink. And despite the green appearance that might make you question your order, it is very tasty and then you can skip your workout that day! ;)   While i was there they also offered me a handful of samples which was wonderful, so I also tried the Freekah (quinoa medley), cucumber salad, and pimento cheese!! All were delicious of course! I can't wait to go back again to try every single breakfast items, all the burgers, and anything with pimento cheese on it!   Also, the staff was super friendly with great recommendations!! The women at the register had gorgeous natural red hair. And the nice woman in the kitchen was very quick!",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of attending a Yelp Elite event where Toucan's catered our lunch. I was very impressed with all of the proper presentation and wrapping of each item in our reusable bag. The attention to detail is something I appreciate being the the meeting coordination industry. The sandwich was absolutely delicious and fresh. You can completely tell they roast their turkey breast onsite and it was not dry. The bread they used was also very good which is a big component to the sandwich as well. The fruit with lavender syrup was such a nice touch. I have a lot of corporate catered events for work and plan on reaching out for assistance in the future.",

We ordered bacon egg and cheeses on bagels, pimento egg on a roll, and a dark roast coffee everything was exceptional.  All their main ingredients are NC sourced which we loved. There's a cute area with games, crayons, and coloring books to keep kids occupied while your waiting for your food. Great food, great experience. It makes a difference when places seem they care about your experience, waste, and local ingredients.",

I went on a Tuesday around 1/130pm. The front parking lot is small so it was full but there is parking in the back. It wasn't busy but most of the tables were occupied. It's spacious but there aren't a lot of tables.   I ordered the jerk chicken salad sandwich with mac and cheese. I'm not sure what was going on but it took a really long time (20+ minutes) to get my food. The wait felt even longer because I was starving when I arrived. It took so long that person who took my order came over to me and said that it was taking too long and offered me cake for free.   So what about the food? Well, the cheesecake was REALLY good. My sandwich was good but not as good as the first sandwich I had. The mac and cheese was not good. I would never recommend that anyone order it unless they like boxed mac and cheese with no seasoning.   The customer service was great though.   Would I go back again? I'm not sure.",

The shop looks clean and seating is well spaced.   And that's about the only positive experience we had, because the food was subpar as were the portions.   I ordered a breakfast biscuit sandwich and I'm not exaggerating when I tell you it was a ONE bite size sandwich. The biscuit was hard and the bacon wasn't crispy and freshly cooked. It was the smallest sandwich I've ever seen!   I would definitely not return or recommend.",

There are items available to purchase outside of the food menu such as wine, jarred honey, and more.   The food there was really good. I got the Friday special which consist of salmon cakes. I got the salmon cakes, side salad and fresh fruit. I really enjoyed my meal. My coworkers got sandwiches which I will try next time as they look really appealing and filling (a lot of bang for your buck).  The staff were really nice and so was the service no was unsure of what I wanted or about some the options on the menu so the staff was very helpful with my questions.

Funky Chicken plus cucumber salad and a mysterious medium coffee. Sandwich is pretty impressive in all it's locally sourced chickeny goodness. Check the parts list, it's got all that working together in the best of ways but the sauce's bright earthiness makes it all swimmy. Wasn't sure about dill with the cucumbers, it's just not how I'm use to (yet?) gives it an almost perfumey taste, maybe some carraway for balance? Regardless, it is full of cucumbery deliciousness!

Located on the westside just off 77 (you can get there in 5-10 minutes from uptown pending where you are), Toucan Louie's is a hidden gem in a converted old gas station.  All of their products are from North Carolina based vendors. Seriously, even the Midas Spring water (it's bottled in Huntersville!). They roast their own turkey, pork and beef in house (all North Carolina raised meats). The burgers are grass fed, the cheese are from NC cheesemakers. The coffee is roasted in house. So many things made in house: granola, peanut butter, pimento cheese.  They provided lunch for one of my Yelp events. Several people said the turkey club was the best sandwich they've ever had. I love the Shrimp salad (I get it on a wrap instead of the roll). The shrimp is steamed in citrus juice. Their Cuban BBQ features a homemade Cuban BBQ sauce that has over 20 ingredients.   Breakfast, lunch, coffee, smoothies, juices- they do a little bit of it all. And I love it! Everyone who works here is so nice, including Owner Marc. Such a good guy.    Note: their parking lot is kind of small, so you may need to park in the overflow lot next door (there's a sign to point you in the right direction).",

They are tucked away over on the west side just off of 77 and right now there is a lot of construction so your favorite mapping ap might take you a interesting way.  I love how almost all of their products are local to NC. They also use paper/ plastic products that can either be recycled or composted. They roast their own coffee and the deli meat is processed in house.  I am slightly obsessed with their shrimp salad sandwich! First off it is HUGE and has so much meat in it you actually can not fit it in your mouth and it has to be eaten with a spoon. It is not all about size as it's taste is also amazing with just the right amount of dill and mayo. Trust me once you try it you will be back for it again and again.   I have now been there a few times and everything I have gotten and my friends have had was been spot on. This is a great new place for breakfast or lunch in the Queen City.",

They make a ton of items in house too; pimento cheese, salad dressings, peanut butter and many more.  There is cute patio on the side and dog friendly. There are a handful of tables inside and would be a great stop if you need to get some work done or want a quieter lunch.

It's got a very nice feel too it, not too cozy but lots of space and seating. I've only gone early to mid morning so not sure how busy it would be at lunch time.

I was so impressed with the presentation (and taste, of course) that I just had to check it out. They were even kind enough to provide alternative items for my lunch (aside from everyone else's) due to food allergies. Also,at the event we were informed that this place pretty much tries to use all fresh/locally-made products and that many of the items they prepare with can be purchased at the restaurant.  I visited on a late Sunday afternoon so there were a few people in/out. The guy taking orders was very polite and service was quick. I ordered a turkey sandwich with hummus and goat cheese. The best way I can describe both sandwiches that I have had from them is wholesome, as in filling and delicious. The bread that I had both times is the perfect combo of toasted, but soft. The bread also has an addictive buttery taste (the bread was a strong factor in my visit. Yes, that good and i like bread).The Turkey was perfectly tender and the hummus, so full of flavor. I purchased a tub to-go.  When I used it to make a sandwich the next day, it really gives the kick that I didn't realize was missing (eh, lunch was getting boring). Honestly, I like it more than any hummus I have ever tasted.   Anyway, I am looking forward to trying out some more stuff from here in the very near future and often. I found the layout of the restaurant to be adorable. It is small, but think cozy/quaint instead of cramped. They have  really done well in maximizing the space. There is table seating as well as bar stools facing the window. There was  also some table-top/card games available. This place gives me the feel of simpler times... It definitely has a little something for everyone's taste buds.",

My friend ordered a classic burger and mac and cheese. His food was good with the exception of the mac and cheese. It was like Kraft . I will definitely return.",

    "text": "BACON!!!!  A wonderful place to grab lunch to go or for delivery at Blue Blaze.  Tried on a bus trip and was blown away from the turkey bacon awesomeness.  The Bread was wonderful, the meat was tasty and the bacon was the best.  I was shocked to find that everything is sourced locally - even bottled water (too much?).  The meat is all roasted at their old converted gas station - including the BACON!!!  The turkey club I ate required me to remove the middle piece of bread - it was just too much bread that took away from the meat, but the turkey and bacon blew me away!    After learning about them from Yelp! We ordered some sandwiches while relaxing at Blue Blaze and was not disappointed.  The PB was wonderful and smooth, and the roast beef was lean but tender.  I am looking forward to trying a burger the next time I venture to Blue Blaze since they are so close.",

    "text": "I really wanted to LOVE this place, but I only LIKE it.  Here is the scoop.... I first visited this place not terribly long after it opened.  The coffee was great, the food was all messed up though.  I ordered a pimento sandwich and they literally didn't put the items on it as indicated on their menu, they only put pimento cheese.  I didn't complain, I just ate it with the mindset that they were new.    My next experience was the same.  I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese, and they literally just placed a slice of cheese on top of the already scrambled eggs.  Presentation is everything, well along with taste of course, and it had neither of those things.  The french toast was okay, after being drowned in what I was told to be maple syrup.  Jury is still out on that one.    They have a few random and sparsely stocked shelves of local items which feel out of place.  They should really rethink the floor plan, especially the shelves.  It has a gas station vibe instead of a cafe.   Long story short, they have enormous potential to really make this great, but it all starts in the kitchen.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed they can listen to feedback and really make this place a hot spot in the community with lines out of the door.",

    "text": "After reading the reviews for this restaurant we had very high hopes for it. I was surprised people said the staff was so friendly because I did not get that vibe at all. We were barely spoken to and instead of asking if we had been in before, the woman at the register just stood there waiting for us to order...no recommendations or questions for us to help.   I ordered the pimento burger and it was just ok, not even top 10 burgers I've had. I didn't care for the bun they put it on. There was not much to say about the side of Mac and cheese, except that it wasn't anything I couldn't get at any other restaurant...not much to it.   My mom ordered the pimento cheese steak and she liked it but it was $7.95 and didn't come with a side. (She even asked if a side was extra to be sure and the girl said yes)   My nephew ordered the home fries with mac and cheese (which he is a conniseur of) and he barely touched the mac. The home fries were great!  My 2 year old got the pbj and ate all of it, but who can't make that at home? Lol  I might come back to try something for breakfast and update. Hopefully they work on their customer service and taste. I really want to like this place, it's so cute and a neat add to the community.",

She explained the menu to me and also let me sample a few things. I finally decided on the shrimp salad sandwich and the 3 cheese mac and cheese. I also purchased a container of jerk chicken salad to save for later. I am not a soda drinker and not big on sweet tea at all. But she let me taste their peach green tea...HONEY!!!!!! It was delicious! And they have the good ice!!!!! They sell it in 10lb bags too.   I was able to meet and talk to the owner Marc, and his manager who runs the place BB. Both were very nice and pleasant. I shall return to check this place out some more!!!",

Staff was very friendly and glad to answer questions about their menu. All of their containers, cups, etc are compostable so that's really cool, too. Prices were fair, but to be honest the food was a little underwhelming - my husband wasn't a fan of his pancakes at all and said they had a weird taste & texture.",

(LOVE) located here in west end in Biddleville! Happy to see more cool lil places starting to pop up around here.   Toucan Louie's named after their dog, Louie.   So today for grand opening they gave away some coffee beans, whoop whoop! And some samples. I tried: their in house pilmento cheese SO GOOD. In house peanut butter which is also good. Hummus, granola, jams, and honey. I recommend their strawberry lavender honey which they sell from a local vender (all jams that is).   Decent selection of canned beer here in their coolers. Otherwise you can find all natural juices (decently priced for 12 oz $4.95-$6.95), coffee, burgers and sandwiches.   Cafe & Roastery  Good vibes here. Boardgames. Friendly/inviting atmosphere. Reminds me of a smaller rhino market.",
