We had some Lo Mein the last time we both went there and it was really yummy.  The service was a little slow the second time we went and it was really slow in the restaurant itself, so I did not understand what the issue was with that, but otherwise this is a pretty good Chinese joint which is reasonably priced compared to some other places close by.  Awesome spot for lunch, which is when I would recommend going the most.",

I love Chinese food and I couldn't even finish the food. I am not a fan of this place. I tried to reheat it the next day and it looked like it had been in the fridge for over a week. Never again.",

I got to the restaurant at about 10:05 just as they were locking the doors to leave.

    "text": "Good, fresh food with large portion size.  Plain but tidy dining room made up of dark red vinyl upholstered wooden booths (plain, not cushy) and apricot-painted walls with Christmas lights hanging around the front.  Everything looked clean.  The sanitation score was 94.0 when I visited.    The \"fried rice\" that comes with the meal is just soy sauce stirred into rice -- no bits of veggie, let alone meat.  You can presumably get the real thing by ordering fried rice as a separate entree.  Luncheon specials from 11-4 priced at $5.95 including the entree, rice, and egg roll are very reasonable, though I have not ordered them.  The main menu runs from $8.95 to $15.95 for most entrees.  My Hunan Shrimp was $9.95 and included only the entree and rice.      I visited there on a Sunday at dusk.  The place was deserted.  The counter staff (owner?) was reasonably pleasant and efficient, but the words warm or friendly just do not apply.  I was charged fairly and the carry-out food was freshly prepared, hot, nicely packaged, and in my hands in no time.  Once I got home, I found I had a large, very fresh order of Hunan Shrimp, which contained really large shrimp and lots of good-looking veggies cut into pretty large pieces.  The portion size was large and fed three hungry people from a single order. This was tasty and superior to what I usually get, so I recommend it.  The hot and sour soup was just okay; I have had better.  The spring roll was small and greasy; not recommended.  Their carryout menu states in large letters that they deliver for orders with a $15 minimum, but when I tried ordering delivery the following Tuesday, I was told that service was available only from 5-9 p.m. on weekends.   The carry-out menu only says they deliver within 5 miles but does not mention the limited availability of this service.  She said their weekday driver had returned to China; apparently, they have no plans to replace the driver  The food was fresh, tastier than many Chinese places, generously portioned, and reasonably priced for what you get, so I will be back.",

I had KungPo Chicken and it was spiced perfectly ( may be too much for some milk drinkers but they'll adjust the level of spice on request ) . The celery,water chestnuts and green peppers in the dish were crunchy and not too oily. The fried rice was average but egg roll batter was flaky like a pastry. Some other pros were our food arrived in about a nanosecond and every server was super friendly. And if you need them ... the bathrooms are squeaky clean !",

This is the absolute WORST Chinese food I have ever had.  Where do I even begin? We ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Crab Rangoons, Hot and Sour soup, and Edamame. Not a single thing was satisfactory. The chicken in the Kung Pao chicken was tiny little pieces and breaded. You aren't supposed to bread the chicken in Kung Pao chicken. They probably did this to increase profits as breading it makes it look like there's more. Also, the vegetables in the Kung Pao chicken were merely celery and carrots, nothing more. The flavor was okay but the ingredients were just crap! The crab Rangoons were soggy, not crispy.  The absolute worst was the hot and sour soup. It had the consistency of saliva, not soup. And the flavor was atrocious. I wouldn't even feed this to a homeless man for fear of bad karma. Finally, the edamame didn't have salt on it. There are two steps to cooking edamame, boiling it and salting it. They couldn't even get that right. These people are obviously out of their minds. I would only eat here again if it were my last option as a starving post-apocalyptic version of myself, even then I might reconsider.",

The Chinese food in Winston-Salem flat out sucks.  We like China Palace because it's an actual sit-down restaurant, unlike the vast majority of Chinese restaurants around us.  We always get the sweet and sour chicken and the orange beef when we're there for dinner hours; hubby got the orange chicken for lunch one time and said it was just as good as the beef.  The portions are enormous and we always have some to put in the cooler with a bag of ice for the ride back to Winston.  The meat is VERY well trimmed - no fatty or grisly bits.  The flavor is good and the dishes come out SMOKING hot.",

They give you a good amount of sesame chicken & lo mein. & how Heather M. said the fried rice is just white rice covered in soy sauce.

The egg roll was good but the size was chintzy at best, probably the size of a spring roll. The lo mein and the shrimp and broccoli were both lackluster and bland, truly devoid of seasoning and super heavy on the oil For over $15 it was most certainly not worth it. The 2 stars are for the speedy service, decent customer service and good past experiences. I'm hoping that they had an off night. Judging by the mixed reviews, consistency seems to be a point of contention. Maybe I've just always gotten lucky.  Unfortunately,  this encounter was so subpar that I won't be coming back.

The Chicken with Cashew nuts was delicious too  (husband let me try a bite, and he liked mine a lot,) and there were lots of cashews on top. He especially liked that there were water chestnuts in it as well.  The chicken wings were to die for! So crispy and juicy, with a moderate batter on them, and perfectly spiced.

It was basically my only Chinese option since not a lot of places in that area have delivery. The rice here is REALLY dry and always tastes more than a day old. Besides the rice, the food is alright. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's average. The chicken wings are prob the best thing I've had from this place. Or any place actually. Sesame tofu and sesame chicken is ok but the sesame tofu tastes better. The lo mein is extra greasy but very tasty.   If you call to order your food, the lady might sound rude and have a hard time understanding you. But after meeting her in person, she's really sweet and understands me very well. She's just not a phone person so don't be put off when you first talk to her on the phone.",

I called the restaurant to inform them that my order was incorrect. Although they made me a new order, I had to return the messed up order. As if I were lying about the incorrect order. For my inconvenience, time, and my gas, I asked to be reimbursed. They gave me free cup of soda...really?",

I was so happy that they were even generous with the sauces they packed with our meals...lots of dick sauce and soy sauce, and we didn't even ask for it. It's like they read our minds!  Great food and they delivered which was also a plus!  We'll definitely be ordering from here again.  Update:  Haha months after posting this I see I said \"dick sauce\" instead of duck sauce. Definitely not what I meant . I was wondering why people thought it was funny.  I see where my mind was at the moment.  We'll keep it.",

I've always been satisfied with my food whether eating in, picking up, or ordering delivery. Delivery comes right on time, never late and their prices are very reasonable. I only ever get one thing: Orange Fried Tofu extra crispy with white rice and it is out of this world good. A lot of places mess up Tofu, but here it is cut into perfect little cubs, fried Just enough for a little crunch and seasoned with the perfect amount of flavor and spice. I always force my friends and family to come here & they thoroughly enjoy it too. The food quality is consistent no matter when you come, and the price is about $11 after tax for an enormous serving of tofu and rice that I usually make 2 or 3 meals out of. I highly recommend China Palace before any place else for Chinese food in University.",

Food was hot, and the plate was filled rim to rim.  But just not that tasty. Lots of veggies, which I liked, but the whole thing was just blah.  Egg roll was small and OK.  Free crunchies with duck sauce to start.  Waitress never checked back after food was delivered, so no beverage/water refill offered.  Nothing bad, but nothing good either.

They were crispy and not oily at all.  The crab rangoons were flat little pockets.  Not what I'm use too.  The filling was nicely seasoned though.

University has changed so much in the past 10 years, I wasn't sure were to go so I went to Yelp for advice. Unfortunately I think my fellow Yelpers led me astray once again.   2:30 on a Thursday this place was empty minus a lady waiting on take out. Came in looked at the menu briefly and had a seat after being directed to do so by the woman at the counter. Five minutes goes by and no one comes up to me to take my order. A gentleman walks in sits down and is promptly waited on. In fact his food came out before I even got to put my order in which is kind of crazy. Ended up getting up and ordering the soup to go since apparently asking for sit-down service in this place is too high of an expectation.  For a $1.70 for lunch I can't complain really with the soup, but I will say it wasn't the most flavorful hot and sour soup. I wouldn't avoid the place at all costs, but I wouldn't be rushing to return either.",
