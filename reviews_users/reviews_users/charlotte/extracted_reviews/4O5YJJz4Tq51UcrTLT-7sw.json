    "text": "Man I love the Summit Room.  I mean it!  It's one of the few places you can go in Charlotte to get a serious, proper cocktail mixed for you, and boy-howdy do their drinks have some spunk to 'em!  (Disclaimer: don't drink and drive, you're smarter than that, and better looking, too!)  I will very likely keep going to the Summit Room regularly until I've tried one of all of their specialty cocktails -- which, while they do carry a relatively high price tag (I think it was around $11 or $12 for some), are easily potent enough to match 2 rum and cokes at your average bar/restaurant.  The food is delicious, creative, and extremely well presented.  It's just beautiful.  Again, the price is a bit higher than some of the other places in the area, but it is really worth the coin.  I wish I had the budget to go more often!  I'd happily recommend the scallops to anyone - you get a hearty portion, and they are cooked to perfection!    If you're not into seafood (and I'm not typically, in truth), ask the staff about their favorites - they've got lots of good things to say.  I'll leave you with one more thing - when you sit down, you'll be given an ice cold cucumber water in a frosty tin cup.  So sweet.",

We ordered several of the summit and seasonal cocktails; the standout was the jalapeno and ghost pepper summit cocktail.   Food: again several dishes ordered here but standouts were the fried green tomatoes, sriracha deviled eggs, and the scallops, although honestly everything was delicious.  Prices aren't cheap but the flavors, service and ambiance make this a spot worth revisiting. Reservations highly recommended - this is a small restaurant.",

I'm referring to the Front of House to Back of House, everyone completely blew us away with their service.

    "text": "Dare I say that The Summit Room is the best new restaurant in Charlotte?! Yes, I do!  The concept is fantastic.  The owner had an epiphany moment after climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro which lead her to open The Summit Room!  The cuisine is southern inspired but is so much more than that. Dishes like shrimp Banh Mi sliders and hummus with harissa add a definite international touch.    I went with my family for Restaurant Week and was simply wowed.  I ordered the French Pear martini (Grey Goose La Poire, St. Germain and a Prosecco topper).  I hoped to try another craft cocktail, but this was so delicious, I ordered a second!   We shared the Banh Mi sliders which were incredible and flavorful! For my entree, I ordered the stuffed cod (not on Queen's Feast menu) which was the perfect dish for a summer meal. I really loved the slight sweetness from the parsnip puree. I also highly recommend the pork belly if you're going for Restaurant Week.    For dessert, I sampled my mom's Krispy Kreme donut bread budding.  Holy crap, that is one delicious dessert. What is not to love about a hot and now in bread pudding form!? YUM.  Go to Summit Room...now!!",

Ribeye was seasoned with too much salt and too fatty! Maybe not the ribeye's fault as I tend to gravitate toward fillet and they did not have that on the menu. Fried chicken was mediocre at best compared to the same at other restaurants in town, i.e Carpe Diem. Great attentive service! Quick turnaround on the meal. Would not recommend the banana pudding dessert as their recipe is sour and not sweet!",

The chef incredibly paired a five-course tasting menu with five beers from Oscar Blues Brewery and the knowledgeable staff and brewery representative made the experience one of a kind!   From what I understand, this will be a monthly event that will alternate between beer pairings and wine pairings, and I would highly recommend either one. The food was phenomenal and all items that are not listed on their usual menu, so it was really a special experience. The guest I brought was even a vegetarian, and they flawlessly accommodated her dietary restrictions and made her special dishes which still paired well with all the beers.  Can't speak highly enough of this!",

We Ubered over so I can't comment on parking, but from the moment we walked in every person working there was friendly and gregarious. Our service was outstanding.  There were 4 of us seated at a round that probably was better suited for a larger party. After a while, we scooted closer together on one side and then it felt more intimate.  We ordered with wild abandon, so we ended up glad we had a big table. Mussels (great flavor, perhaps slightly overcooked), mac and cheese (wonderful, although we asked to hold the bacon), fries (super crisp -yum!), cous cous salad, cucumber salad (the \"everything\" seasoning is the shizzle), roasted potatoes (we fought over who would get the take home leftovers), pimento cheese corn fritters (no one should die without eating these), and 2 different flatbreads (mushroom variety was voted least favorite item on table though).  We had several people stop by and remark about all the food on the table (for 4 ladies, no less). Haha. It was EPIC.  We each had a craft cocktail and we ordered a bottle of wine for the table - yet.... only about $50 each (before tip). What a deal.  If you're going to go, just go for it! What you cannot eat, take home or just leave it. It's worth it just to try the multitude of amazing offerings.  I will definitely be back.",

It was the first day of restaurant week, so I wasn't sure if we'd be able to sit down without a reservation. Luckily, there were still open spots at the bar and at the tables outside. We chose to sit outside on one of the few Charlotte summer days that wasn't overwhelmed with humidity. It was a lovely evening for a lovely meal.  We shared the kale salad, and he had the NC crusted trout, while I had the mussels. The kale salad was dressed with a light house-made vinaigrette, and had flavorful additions such as pickled thinly sliced radish, roasted peanuts, and grape tomatoes. Very fresh and light. It was a pretty large portion, so it was perfect to share as an appetizer.  The trout was lightly crusted and was pan fried perfectly to get crispy skin without being smothered in grease. The filets sat over a bed of creamed corn that tasted very farm to table fresh.  My mussels were delicious as well. Aside from the wonderful flavors, I appreciated the little bits of radish sprouts sprinkled throughout.   Overall, I loved my meal and look forward to trying the other items on their menu, such as chorizo collards, shrimp banh mi sliders, and their fresh juice cocktails.",

    "text": "Yum! Is the word I would use to describe the food and drinks at this wonderful little Dilworth Gem!  Of course I discovered this place through Yelp and decided to give it a try with some friends who recently moved into town.  At first glance, the menu is easy to read and offers the right amount of variety without being overwhelming.    I like that menu is seasonal and that Chef Martin believes in using sustainable, local foods.  This gives you something new to look forward to whenever you visit.   The service was great.  We sat outside and were served ice cold cucumber water (Yum!).  After placing our orders for food and drinks,  we were served these AMAZING, soft and flavorful cheese scones.  I could eat those ALL DAY! We had a larger party, and our server was kind enough to get us another round of these delicious scones.    I started off with a perfectly made specialty cocktail: lemongrass-basil refresher.  I don't enjoy overly sweet drinks, and they made sure my drink was made to my liking.  It only had a hint of sweetness, along with the wonderful flavor of fresh basil and lemongrass.    The among the memorable dishes ordered by our party at that table were: the summit burger, skillet mac N cheese, house fries, the drunken mussels, BBQ chicken flat bread and the shrimp Banh mi sliders.   Each dish was delicious and cooked to the right temperature, and the portions were reasonable (not overly big but not too small).  The prices are definitely on the higher side, but the food and beverages are absolutely worth trying!   The Summit Room would not be my \"local\" joint or casual dining spot when I want to grab a quick bite, mostly because of the price point, but it is one of the best restaurants I have eaten at in the Charlotte area and is great for a special occasion.  I cannot comment on the ambience of the inside seating, but the decor was cute.  Outdoor seating is nice and great for groups.    I have several friends who are vegetarian, and will say that though the menu has a limited selection of \"veg friendly\" dishes, the ones they do have (at least currently) on the menu, sound very delicious.   I am looking forward to going back and trying another specialty cocktail with some delicious food soon!",

It looks totally different than when it was Bruegger's - I can't speak to the Mayobird side, but I definitely felt like I was in a casual, trendy restaurant. A girlfriend and I went after work and got there right at 5:00 when they opened. We were only the second people in there, and we grabbed a seat at the bar.  The bar itself is awfully pretty... glass bottles as far as the eye can see and silver bar stools lend themselves to a very clean, modern feel without being sterile. There were maybe 12-14 seats at the bar, a few tables along the side, and a high, long table at the front near the front door. There's also a huge, inviting patio, but it was a little sweltering the night we were there. I also love the huge, private parking lot, which is a little rare on East Blvd.  Our bartender, Scott, was so fun and gave us honest recommendations on what to get. I think he got a little overwhelmed later in the evening, but I'm guessing they're just getting their footing. We opted to split the BBQ shrimp appetizer and chicken flat bread appetizer. The chicken flat bread came in four pieces, which were delicious if just a smidgen dry, and the BBQ shrimp was pretty tasty, too. It came over a corn pudding, which tasted verrrry corny, so buyer beware. We were also given complimentary cheddar scones before dinner, which tasted like the delicious Red Lobster cheddar bay biscuits, only in light scone form... mmmmm.  We each got a signature cocktail; there are 7, and they're named after the tallest summit on each continent. The Mount Vinson was very smooth - cinnamon, ginger beer, vanilla - and The Kilimanjaro was refreshing and sweet for summer - lemonade, cranberry, gin.  When we left, we noticed that the patio was packed! This is a great \"classy\" addition to a casual row of restaurants on East Blvd. Do yourself a favor, and check out The Summit Room.",

    "text": "So, I think this should really be 4.5 but I'll round up :). A newbie to the Charlotte restaurant scene, The Summit Room has jumped on the farmhouse-chic train with metal chairs, exposed wood beams, and antler mounts. It's a great vibe, perfect for a gals night out, a date, or happy hour. On the smallish side, cozy and a bit loud because of the close quarters. Cute, outdoor porch that overlooks East Blvd. and Dilworth. Yes, I suppose this place may be a little on the girly side.b  They have a list of 7 specialty cocktails that are all $11 and named after the seven summits--a cute touch I thought. I opted for beer and was happy to find a decent-sized list of local and regional craft brews. The menu consists of soups/salads, starters and share plates, and larger plates. They also provide mini cheesy scones in lieu of rolls. YUM!   We sampled the chicken flatbread ($12) with chimichurri grilled chicken, spinach goat cheese, confit oyster mushrooms, tomatoes, cilantro. DOUBLE YUM! Decent sized portion and a unique twist of flavors.  Next up the mussels. Lots of mussels. To be fair the mussels were definitely on the smaller size but they were perfectly cooked and delicious. Mussels came accompanied by toasted bread to dip in the buttery broth.  Lastly, to end on a sweet note, we ordered the creme brulee which was served with fresh fruit and absolutely delectable.  One thing I wasn't impressed with was our server. A little slow, didn't seem to really know the menu, and mixed up the bill a few times. Not terrible, per say, but definitely not notable.",

    "text": "Heard from a co worker that we needed to try The Summit Room, after looking at the menu online we decided to give it a shot.  Honestly, I was sold when I saw the Scallops A La Plancha served with carrot puree and pickled peach relish. Unfortunately upon arrival, I discovered it wasn't on the menu anymore. So just a bit of advice guys, update the menu on your website.  Entering the restaurant was a little awkward. Their is a small divide about 2 feet from the door which we thought was the host stand, but really is for privacy for low tables in the bar area. We entered at the same time as another party and the nice hostess was busy bussing tables at the time, so we were fairly cluttered and not sure where to stand (that would be out of the way.)  We sat at the bar while waiting on a table outside, bartenders were very friendly but not very up to date with what seasonal beers they had on tap.    Once seated outside we ordered some appetizers, nothing to brag about here. We tried one of the \"flatbreads\" only to get a small, four piece, doughy pizza. The taste was just ok, however, I would never order it again.  Overall, the aesthetics were pleasing, minus the mounted deer head and animal skulls, the patio area was nice, minus the roaches, and the service was fine. Bottom line, we were extremely disappointed with the food, which we had such high hopes for. Sorry Summit Room, we will not be returning to your establishment.",

    "text": "I've been hearing some buzz about this place over the past few months and we decided to check it out.  It lived up to the hype!    The Summit Room is set in what looks like a big old house, and it shares space with this chicken salad place (???).  There is a really nice patio area out front and a big porch with rocking chairs where you can sit and enjoy a cocktail or three.  And you'll probably want three just so you can try as many of the interesting liquid concoctions as you can get down your gullet.  The Cucumber Collins is an excellent summer drink, a delicious twist on a Tom Collins.  Another nice option is the Chocolate Old Fashioned which is a cool take on the classic Bourbon drink.   The dining room is small, loud, and happenin'.  If you are looking for an intimate or romantic setting, don't go here.  It's hip and loud and energetic all around.  There are various animal skulls on the walls and a deer head mounted over a doorway - not sure how I feel about all that jazz but whatever I can deal with it for the delicious eats.  The grilled zucchini flatbread is money as an appetizer.  So is the now-famous BBQ shrimp appetizer that comes on a slab of corn pudding.  If you have all that PLUS the complementary cheese scones, you are already feeling pretty full.  But you have to hang in there for the main courses.  I had the duck which was really tasty - it came with blueberry grits and wilted spinach.  The wife got this huge piece of wild caught salmon.  Both were spot on.  We didn't have room for dessert after all that, but the desserts looked pretty tasty as well.  Summit Room is a cool spot with creative twists on some down-home Southern dishes!",

The winner here is some of the best gnocchi I've ever had ! I would not hesitate to get the dish again, and it was clear the pasta here is homemade.   Cons: My friend and I had the Lobster Nachos and she said they changed from the first time she ordered them. This is definitely a problem, because you want to know if you like something it will be the same when you come back. Unfortunately for us, this time, they weren't very good. The lobster was scant, and the pimento aioli overwhelmed. My other issue with this place is that the portions are a bit small for the price. I would have loved to take my husband here since I  enjoyed  the pasta dish, but I know he would not be a fan of the portions so it likely won't become part of our rotation.   I will have to try again with friends someday, just to have that gnocchi one more time : )",

    "text": "5 stars for the food... 3 for the ambiance and service. This place is fairly new, and I hope the quality of the food keeps it in business - it was pretty quiet at dinner on a Monday night.  Upside - no wait for a table!  Very unique cocktail and food menu - made for a difficult choice. I started with the strawberry lemonade cocktail, and my husband had the Everest. Both were fantastic. For food we tried the street corn salad (with popcorn!!!), bbq pork belly with mac n' cheese, and the farro risotto. WOW!! We loved every bite.  Upscale comfort food at its best.  Overall, the ambiance seemed caught in an identity crisis - the decor has sort of a retro-modern farmhouse quirkiness, which doesn't seem to match the refined caliber (and price) of the food.  The restaurant is small, and has the potential for an intimate, cool vibe, but it didn't really deliver on this visit.  My biggest gripe would be the uncomfortable metal chairs - they were cold on my legs and looked like they belonged in a 50's diner.  I'd expect something a little more comfortable and high-end considering the overall quality of the cuisine. A few small cosmetic tweaks could help The Summit Room deliver the full dining experience you'd expect from this type of place.",

    "text": "The Summit Room will most certainly be a staple eatery of ours for the foreseeable future.  We've been twice now and have been very pleased with the entire place.  It's still a fairly new restaurant, so they are working through some kinks... but overall this is a place to add to your Charlotte bucket list.  The breakdown:  Environment: A++.  If it's nice out, try to get a space on the front porch or in the rocking chairs.  Decor is lovely, very industrial chic.  Hardwoods, white accents.  Music was on point.  The wait staff was very nice.  Food: The Kale Salad.  Just do that - every time.  The dressing, the kale, the garnish... DAMN.  It's one of those salads that makes you feel like you're not actually eating a salad.  The potato gnocchi is a great dish overall, not too large for those of us who feel guilty after eating an entire plate of pasta.  The cheddar scones rival any southern cheddar biscuit I've tasted.  What a delight.  The salmon was not my favorite, but still good.  The shrimp bahn mi sliders were great!  Warning, they come with a kick!  My one wish is that they add a few more entree options for those of us wanting to limit the carbs/meat intake.  Drinks: Give me that Chocolate Old Fashion EVERY DAY.  Sounds gross right?  Not at all!  They use handmade chocolate bitters and it's heavenly.  Served in a small snifter - perfect for bourbon fans.  My boyfriend got the pear martini and it was delicious!  Not at all what you would expect - light, summery, with a citrus finish.  Kinks: We went to dinner last night (Tuesday evening).  We pulled up and were ecstatic to see that there were a bunch of tables available outside.  When we walked in we asked for a table outside (there were three clean and one dirty that I saw) - the host quickly said no, that they were reserved and that he had people waiting for awhile.  No worries, he offered us two rocking chairs outside which was actually way better.  The funny part was that the tables remained unfilled the entire time we were there.  The wait staff seemed completely overwhelmed outside.  I give them a ton of credit because they were HUSTLING... but it took us awhile to get our drink orders and even longer for food.  I kind of had to pull our waitress aside to order rather than her asking us what we wanted.  Again, not a huge deal. We were completely content to sit outside and enjoy the weather and our drinks.  Overall: We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "hmmmm.....for now I'm going to give 3 stars for The Summit Room.  I WILL go back with a smaller party and I'm almost positive it will be better.  Our waitress was extremly nice.  So nice in fact I wanted to be her BFF..haha! Our party was 11 girls.  That in itself is overwhelming.  11 loud crazy females.  Me included.  Anywho...so I'm trying to take that into consideration as well.  The first issue was that apparently they serve their wine with out the upcharge and sell them at grocery store prices.  YOU HAD ME AT \"NO UPCHARGE\".  All the girls arms went into the air and we said \"bring on the wine list!!\".  Until I saw the price on a bottle of wine that I normally get in another location that's not a grocery store however sells nothing but wine and beer.  (not sure if it's policically correct to name that said place so I'll keep it to myself).  It was list price for $35, but I normally get it for $18.  I was heartbroken.  Oh well...I still order it.  It's good and I split it with three other women so it made sense.    The second issue was that me and the girl next me ordered the same soup.  She also ordered a side of mash potatoes as our ENTREE.  We didn't order apps.  Some of the table did...but we didn't know this.  We specified that it was our main dish and we even handed back our menu.  Food starts coming out and the runners places our soups in front of us.  Cold soup that should have been warm.  :-(  Then....45 min later...we over heard the waitress telling the two girls across from us that \"those two over there got your soup that's why you don't have yours.  It's not our fault it's theres.....\" whaaaaa??  Come to find out they, too, ordered soup as an appetizer and it came out with the first round.  How were we supposed to know that a) they were bringing out apps and not main dishes b) they put the soup we ordered in front of us and c) how is this our fault again??  I didn't like the way she handled that but again...we were 11 girls deep and having a great time.  SO with that said, I'm willing to give this place another try but I def won't \"fall for the bannana in the tailpipe\" and order a bottle of wine that I could get for half in a \"grocery store\"",

Only reason I didn't give a 5 star review was we entered the restaurant at 6:05p and there was no one at any of the tables. When asked if we had a reservation (which we did not) we were told all the tables were reserved for later that evening and could wait or sit at the bar. There were only 2 seats at the bar so we decided to sit there. Before we left around 7:15, there were still more than half the restaurant tables empty...hmmm...otherwise everyone was very nice and courteous!

The drinks are great, definitely a strong point and can totally understand why people go to drink and eat appetizers. The apps and sides were great but I had a steak that I think they ran out to Applebee's and grabbed right after I ordered it because it was  absolutely terrible. I will definitely give this place another shot but for $100, I expect the entire meal to be amazing. Service was okay.",

Every item has an adventure dining twist. Lots of options if you want to snack and drink or have a major meal. Service was a little slow but the ambiance was relaxed so it didn't matter. They never mentioned desert or a desert menu so I guess they don't serve it.  Like the Dilworth neighborhood it resides in it is waaaay more expensive than it looks or feels. Surised a place this trendy wasn't on Open Table, figured they didn't take reservations. Turns out they do, they were booked.They mentioned some service I never heard of or to just call them. Pretty prehistoric for such a trendy place.THose things aside, a real winner. Best new place in town just has Saturday night prices  with a Tuesday night ambiance. Get over it and enjoy, that's why we work.",

The story behind the concept and the furniture in the restaurant was so cool to read about.  Service was impeccable - they thought our entree was taking too long (we didn't)...and gave us a free soup to share.  Never felt rushed - loved just sitting and relaxing instead of feeling like we needed to pay our bill and get up to leave.  Food was delicious - BBQ shrimp are phenomenal, the duck was the best I've had in any CLT restaurant.  Our only complaint was we wish there were more rocking chairs on their front porch - we would've loved to have grabbed a couple and stayed for another drink but they were all full.  Also, we had a front table so the noise wasn't too loud but I can imagine further back it would be quite loud.  Can't wait to go back - don't miss out on this one!",

Long story short, out of the 4 small plates we ordered the one that finally made it to our table was not edible. Way over cooked and just not good and we found hair in the food. We waited another half hr and finally called it quits. The manager was apologetic but pretty nonchalant about the situation.",

Came in as a group of 4 on a busy Friday without reservations after calling in and being told there would be a 20 minute wait -- and they were confident about the time.   So we headed to the bar, where we were able to grab a couple of seats, some nice specialty drinks, and 20 minutes later - BAM - table was ready.  The menu has so many delicious choices, and we tried our best to eat as much as we could! We started with some shared apps:  Drunken Mussels $15 Steamed mussels, OMB Copper, roasted cherry tomatoes, jalapeno/sweet onion relish, grilled baguette. Mussels were fresh, small and sweet and dunking was must!  Fries and Gravy $12 Harissa lobster gravy, chive oil, cheese curd. This Southern version of poutine was good, although a heavier dish and the cheese could be improved.  Shrimp Banh Mi Sliders $14 Crispy pork belly, pickled carrot/jalapeno relish, cilantro aioli, on baguette. WOW! This was killer.  We moved on to main courses, but I was the only one to venture away from the duck:  Braised Short Rib $24 Fall off the bone short ribs, on the bone, roasted garlic potatoes   Duck $25 Confit duck leg and seared duck breast, blueberry grits, wilted spinach, pickled blueberries, pea shoots  We had lots of fun with the staff, both at the bar and the table.  This is the kind of place we would live at if it wasn't three states away.  Corkage $25",

Tasted a friend's Brussels's sprouts and they were full of flavor. Had collard greens and they were okay. Flavorful, just not special. I'd come back here for drinks and appetizers. Certainly a place for a good time. Also, it started POURING down while we were there and one of the servers offered to escort us to the car because we had no umbrella. Just SO kind.

I visited on a Friday evening with a friend and were seated immediately (only because they had a recent cancellation...lucky us!). Service was great, attentive and personable. Ambiance was cozy, modern and fun. Excellent place to come and enjoy a great meal with friends. A+ on both regards.  We started off with the banh mi sliders and the BBQ Shrimp. First, the corn pudding served with the BBQ shrimp...delicious and savory. And the shrimp? Succulent. Sliders were crunchy and tasty - everything a pork belly sandwich should be.  I had the brie stuffed hen and was afraid that the brie would be too mild with chicken. Not at all. The chicken was perfectly roasted and juicy, making the Brie a perfect match. My friend ordered the duck - seared to perfection and the pickled blueberries topped it off. Mhmm.  For dessert, I ordered the caramel apple galette. OMG are my thoughts. How could the crust be more perfect than it was? Crunchy and fluffy but melt-in-your-mouth at the same time. And the caramel apples filling the middle? Pure decadent. My friend ordered the special: persimmon jam donut with chocolate creams. Another moist and rich dessert that was absolutely yummy.  Many cocktail and wine selections. Their cocktails are fun, tasty and unique.  Highly recommended. Good eats. You won't be disappointed.",

On the latter of the two visits, that was sort of the problem.... the starters we so good that we just kept ordering more and had to raise the white flag before reaching the entrees. Both times service was excellent and suggestions from the bar were spot on.  Why no fifth star? The problem is that the mains just don't quite live up to the standard of the starters, those unreal cheese scones (of which I could have scoffed down a basket full) and the cocktails. Yes, I'm picking at little details but the Summit Room is up to the challenge.  Highly, highly recommended.",

The summit burger was awesome, and the gnocchi were fantastic. We order four different summit drinks, which were $7.95 a piece and they were very good. Overall, no complaints, just a bit overpriced.",

    "text": "Perfection!  What a terrific new addition to the charlotte food scene! The very second that I tasted the buttered french baguette dipped in the beer based mussel gravy, was the moment I fell in love with the Summit room, and then...  with every bite of the other dishes we ordered, the love only grew stronger. With a unique cocktail menu, great wine & beer selection, and fancy new age southern food, SR and chef Brent Martin have a lot to offer. We started with a glass of red wine and an Aconcagua (a cachaca, based cocktail with fresh squeezed lime sour, muddled jalapenos, ghost pepper syrup and a salted rim) between the husband and I. On the table we also had the Drunken Mussels (gravy made with local beer from OMB - Awesome!), BBQ shrimp (my favorite!), the daily special fried green tomatoes topped with a poached egg, house fries (delicious!!), complimentary cheddar cheese scones (which were delightful), and we ended the meal with a pecan / pumpkin dessert with creme fraiche, caramel corn and sweet corn ice cream - unique and terrific!  I understand that in a few weeks there will be a different menu for the new season, but I hope and pray that the Chef will maintain his brilliant style, essence and absolute amazingness in all the dishes he creates!  Outside of the food now... The service was great; our server Scott was friendly and attentive and made great recommendations. With indoor and outdoor seating, the vibe and decor at SR is casual yet classy. I'm already looking forward to my next visit!",

They kept the names of the cocktails but got rid of the staples i.e. the drink with the red wine floater. The chicken sliders were 3 chicken nuggets at best on biscuits for $16, not worth it at all. Very disappointed to visit one of our favorite spots again to find it empty and the menu changed.  Much better places to visit in Charlotte for the money",

    "text": "THE SUMMIT ROOM: Go. Don't just sit there, GO. Go on! Get up! Go! You can read my review on the ride over.  This is probably the best new restaurant Charlotte's seen in a couple of years. Not only is the everything on the menu upscale, trendy, local, and fresh, but the prices are SUPER reasonable and the service is A+.  We went on an early summer evening, so we couldn't resist the urge to sit outside. The patio area is incredibly charming, with hanging lights and a view of a quiet part of East Blvd. The inside of the restaurant looked very pleasant as well: wooden furniture in warm colors with a lot of light coming in from the outside. Very welcoming.  Speaking of welcoming, our server knew the menu backwards and forwards and could describe each dish beautifully based on his honest opinion of the food. A server who tells you what's in each dish is good, but a server that is honest about what s/he likes is worth their weight in gold. It paid off.  We weren't chomping at the bit for food, so we went straight to the main event. I ordered the mussels and the BBQ shrimp, while my companion ordered the stuffed cod. Everything was fantastic, but it was the BBQ shrimp - which we split as an appetizer - that was by far the standout. The shrimp were extra fresh and quite large. They were slathered in a smokey BBQ sauce and served atop a sweet and luscious corn pudding. A touch of tasso cream on the side made for a great dipping sauce when desired.  The mussels were outstanding, with the innovative twist being that they were cooked in a broth made with Olde Mecklenburg Brewery Copper Ale. They were served with some stewed veggies and some grilled bread, which, let's face it, is the REAL reason why everyone gets mussels. The mussels themselves are always wonderful, but dipping the bread in the broth after you've polished off your mollusks is like touching the face of Poseidon.  The stuffed cod was quite good. The scallops stuffed inside were a wonderful touch and the fact that this glorious combination of seafood was only $24 made it impossible to turn down. The cod itself is presented beautifully in two pieces - you can see the pictures in this restaurant's Yelp profile - and comes with a candied lemon wheel and arugula butter. Both these accouterments can make this stellar dish even better if applied sparingly. The one thing I didn't like about this dish was the size of the sweet peas in the scallop stuffing. They were a bit too large and mild, so they ended up distracting from what might best be described as a sonata of flavors. In spite of that, the dish was still quite satisfying.  Okay, you've read my review and now (I hope!) you've pulled up to The Summit Room and are about to enjoy a fantastic meal. Bon appetit.",

    "text": "I remember when hitting east boulevard for grub used to be a little hit or miss, and more often than not meant you were grabbing something very casual. However, it has been fun to watch the aggressive expansion of fine dining options on this little strip of town. The Summit Room is one of these places that boasts fine eastern NC inspired eats with a stout cocktail list inspired by the seven summits (get it?).  We stopped in on a Thursday night that was one of those gorgeous 70 evenings, hoping to grab a seat on their surprisingly large outside patio. Apparently half of Charlotte had the same idea so we had no such luck. We did get placed near the window, but my one gripe about the place was how loud it could get inside. But let's move onto the meal.  We started off with a mixed drink each. I got the Aconcagua (a spicy, south american inspired drink) while my wife got the Kilimanjaro (Gin drink with a great balance of sweet and tangy). Both were right on the money. I would definitely go back just to try more of their signature cocktails. To divide and conquer the menu, we decided to split some appetizers and a main dish. We settled on the shrimp banh mi sliders, drunken mussels, and BBQ ribs. The drunken muscles were easily our favorite dish. They are cooked in local beer (OMB copper), which made a great sauce to dip in the provided sweet bread. Also the BBQ rib serving size was borderline ridiculous. Between the three dishes, we had almost too much food - but no complaints here about that!  Overall, The Summit Room is a great addition to the East Boulevard restaurant scene. I look forward to going back sometime soon.",

We enjoyed the pimento cheese and low country boil skewers as appetizers.  Both were off the charts delicious.  Paired with a pernicious beer from Wicked Weed made them even better!  The pimento cheese had a smoked flavor which made it very unique.  We also had the surf and turf flatbread -- shrimp and filet.

    "text": "Our first experience at The Summit Room was a little hit or miss...   Highlights (food wise) included the burrata, BBQ shrimp and bruleed brussel sprouts. All of the drinks and desserts we tried were outstanding. I actually commented that I'd return JUST for the drinks and sweets. All the drinks are made 100% in house with no premade/store bought mixes and the desserts are so beautifully plated AND tasty! I loved the slow, leisurely service as I hate feeling rushed though a gourmet meal. We had about 20-30 minutes between each course. But, my boyfriend didn't like it and commented that service seemed sluggish. So, this could go either way, depending on your preference, I suppose. I also loved the laid back, \"top of a ski mountain,\" lodge-esque design and decoration. Oh! And the water!! I know it seems silly but I LOVED the cucumber water served in stainless steel cups. I drank at least a gallon's worth.   The lowest point was, without a doubt, the lobster nachos. They sound so decadent on the menu. The plate of store bought tostitos, embarrassingly skimpy amount of lobster and gross green stuff randomly globbed all over the plate was so disappointing. We had that first and I was worried the whole meal would follow suit. Luckily, we just happened to start with what I'd imagine is the worst dish on their menu. Trust me on this -- do NOT order this dish, no matter how great the description reads on the menu.   The burger, fries and sweet potato empanadas were just slightly above average. By the way -- I did NOT order all that food! ;) I went with friends and tried some of everyone else's dishes. Speaking of, the taste of gnocchi and shrimp bahn mi sliders I tried were great!   Topped it all off with pumpkin cheesecake. Perfect, seasonal dessert accompanied by these tasty gumdrop things and topped with smoked sea salt. It was the perfect mix of sweet and salty/savory. Two words... Yum. O.   Soooo, long story short, I think The Summit Room does have some room to grow and dishes to improve on, but overall, very solid addition to the Charlotte restaurant scene.",

They set up a table for us by the front window which brought in beautiful lighting. We each ordered a cocktail of the menu. They accidentally gave my sister the wrong cocktail so they comped it and bought us a glass of wine.

    "text": "The Summit Room! Wow! Great experience!  After a nice dinner nearby, we stopped in for dessert, coffee and drinks. What follows is a True story...  Mango Curd Tart: such a beautiful and playful presentation! Little bits of mango prepared in at least two ways, dried and candied/poached, with small peaks of meringue leading up to the tart. It was like a little trail of mango and meringue breadcrumbs leading up to the candy house. The tart itself is a sweet and sour mango curd nestled in phyllo dough and topped with a golden layer of white wine meringue. You must try this!  Cheesecake: two slices of cheesecake with Vanilla Wafer crust artfully placed with strawberry compote, rhubarb sauce and raspberry powder. It's cha cha time for your taste buds!  Chocolate Milk Dessert Cocktail: Godiva Chocolate Liquor, Kahlua, vodka and cream. Wonderful! You will not get a milk mustache from a martini glass, so don't be concerned. Way to tasty and smooth to be legal!!  Great decor, love all the antlers, especially the wall of ceramic ones; a very Georgia O'Keefe vibe. Lots of exposed wood embellishments and table tops, with a well-worn rustic feel but still with a modern undercurrent. The stainless steel water glasses are unique and classy! The wall of Mason Jars behind the bar is a nice surprise for the eye.   Our bartender and the other staff were welcoming and took great care of us. Other than a stunning menu and great staff, one of the best things here is the plating. It is done sooo artistically! Some of the dishes should be hanging up in a museum.",

A very fun place to hang out with friends, enjoy beer, wine or speciality cocktails like, my favorite, the berry smash. On summer nights its especially nice to use the rocking chairs or sit on patio and enjoy the night air.  Yummy cornbread, cheesy scones, and salads.",

Our bartender was extraordinarily helpful in telling us about drinks, letting us try different liquors to get our flavor profiles, and modifying our drink orders a little bit. Their specialty drinks are named after mountain summits, which is pretty cool (it made for a fun game of \"Google That Mountain!\"). I ordered the Aconcagua (a spicy drink named after a summit in Argentina) and The Lady ordered a Cucumber Collins based on our bartender's recommendation. Both were excellent. I didn't know they had a full menu prior to coming here, so I'm leaving this one on the bookmark list to come right back!",

It isn't that they aren't any good - the problem is that almost everything sounds tasty.   The good news is that we were there during their happy hour, where you get half price appetizers (weekdays only), so naturally we dug into that section of the menu. Especially useful since that's where most of the things were that we wanted to try, and since these were small plates/shareables, it means we were able to try several. Probably more than we should.  Their happy hour is definitely the way to go if you're on the fence, as you can try several items - just be sure you don't go overboard (I mean you can take it to go, but where is the fun in that?), you can always order more if you need it, and the staff is friendly and helpful if you're in need of another beverage or another order if the first - or first few - didn't do it.",

The drinks are named after famous mountains and the food is southern with a twist. They have high top tables and low top tables. My friend and I sat at a high top table and they do have a hook on th inside of the high top table for your bags.  I ordered the lavendar mule, which was sweet and I didn't taste much lavender in it. They serve you complimentary cheese scones with butter. We devoured them. I told our server that some honey butter would be great with the scones and she actually bought us more scones with a side of honey and butter.  To eat I had the cab filet. It's about a 7oz filet. It was mildly seasoned but cooked perfectly to my medium temp request. It was also served with a pat of herbed butter. The portion sizes of the sides and the entree were pretty good. I also had a side of mac and cheese and the brussel sprouts. The entree came with mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach but I didn't want that, so for a $4 up charge, I got what I wanted. The mac and cheese was good but it was a bit runny. I needed it to be more congealed. The brussel sprouts were good, they're pretty sweet because of the maple syrup.  This is a quaint spot to come and eat dinner with friends or for a date.",

Honestly, this review might have 5 stars if it weren't for the Ojos del Salado cocktail. I love tequila, limoncello, jalapeno, and coffee, but this just didn't work out. I regretted it immediately.  BUT the other cocktails that I've tried at Summit Room have been delicious. I love the Kilimanjaro and Goose loves the Honey Crisp Old Fashion. They definitely add to the cocktail scene in Charlotte!  As far as food goes, the corn pudding on the BBQ Shrimp was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Goose really loved his Nashville hot sliders as well (the biscuits at Summit Room are on point!).  I'd definitely recommend checking this place out for cocktails and light bites!",

    "text": "A neighbor of mine told me to add a bookmark for The Summit Room some time ago, but we did not have a chance to try them until recently.  I'm so glad we did!  I really like restaurants that put a lot of effort into crafting their cocktail menus.  And Summit Room did a phenomenal job here.  My husband tried two of the seven summits, and I had their blueberry smash.  They were all good, but the blueberry smash was the clear winner.   My husband started with their soup of the day, with peas and fennel.  It didn't sound like one I would enjoy, but i had a few tastes, and it was delicious.  I had the pimento cheese corn fritters, and they were both crispy and spicy.  Yum!  For our entrees, I had the salmon, and my husband had the Cornish hen.  I believe their menu rotates frequently, but this salmon -- topped with a cucumber relish and served with pureed arugula and polenta fries -- was one from the best I've ever had.  The salmon was cooked medium (a little pink in the middle, just like I like it), and was so very juicy.  I never would have expected cucumbers to pair well with salmon, but I was mistaken!  They added awesome flavor to every bite.  The polenta fries were lightly fried and soft inside, and perfectly seasoned.    My husband's Cornish hen had a sweet glaze, and was served with peaches and johnny cakes.  It was a bit sweet for my taste (I prefer savory dishes all the way), but he loved it.    Service was very good.  This is a small place, and our server watched over us to ensure we didn't have want for anything.  Parking is great, especially in this part of town.  Summit is connected to Mayo Bird, and they share a very large parking lot on the side of the building.     We'll definitely return!",

    "text": "Hmmm... I really don't know how I feel about The Summit Room. I have had this spot bookmarked before and me and the boyfriend decided to venture out. FYI- seating is very limited so I would suggest coming for either an early dinner or a later dinner. Parking was easy with the connected parking lot.   I didn't care for the drinks at all. They were too strong for me, my younger self would've been more appreciative of the heavy hand but I had to force myself to finish the drink.   This spot is more tapas spot than entree based from what I saw so we ordered a cheese board with prosciutto which was good. We also split a shrimp dish, stuffed portobello mushroom (DELICIOUS!!!!!!), and macaroni and cheese. The food wasn't all that stellar except for the mushroom and I'm not even a vegetarian!  Price points were okay. Overall, I wasn't impressed but the vibe was really upscale casual- which I enjoyed. Service was also really good.",

Fig and prosciutto flatbread seem reheated, not fresh. Mixed drink with crushed ice? Who does that? I don't want to water my drink down as fast as possible...that's missing the point of a mixed drink. If I wanted to water down my alcohol, I'd order a draft beer. Also, there's clearly discord among staff and management. Bartenders and wait staff standing in corner gossiping about manager. No one cares about bathrooms. At least take the time to change the toilet paper rolls and empty trash before shift starts. Skip the shift meeting because it doesn't help. Should have stayed at Kid Cashew across the street. Much higher quality food, much friendlier staff, excellent drinks.",

Actually... now that I think about it... the last time I was in the building was when this side used to be a Bruegger's Bagels and the Caribou connected to it on the left side of the building.  My things have changed!  Their cocktail menu is super creative... each drink named after a real peak somewhere in this world we call Earth.  I like the idea of being able to conquer the summit... just like what I did with the two delicious drinks I had that evening.    Our party of 3 sat in the big communal high top, which was cool... I think it could seat 12?  My math/counting may have been on the brink that evening... but great to have the option of a large party table and the smaller tables spread out around the room.  Our server Nick made sure we were taken care of (even though we were there just for drinks).    Really cool, relaxed but upscale vibe to the dining space.  The food that was being delivered to the other tables looked pretty tasty.  I will have to come back!",

The bartenders were very pleasant, and I could tell they put time into the cocktails they were making.   I enjoyed one of the \"summits\" - the Denali ($12). Very delicious drink. Right up my alley. My boyfriend tried the chocolate old fashioned ($11), and he wasn't as impressed with his drink as I was with mine.   We only got one drink each. I feel like the prices are standard for cocktails in Charlotte, but I feel like this is a one and done drink place or you will spend a million dollars. I really liked my drink, but didn't feel like this place was on par with say, The Cellar. I will come back for the occasional late night cocktail though.    I've heard good things about the food. A little of how wary dinner for two might cost though.",

I had heard a few different things about The Summit Room, but had not personally tried it.  Walking in, you see a smaller restaurant with an open fireplace, a bar, and a narrow, but functional community table.  Other tables fill the space that they have utilized well.  There's also a patio area off the front and the building is shared with The Mayobird; another favorite breakfast/lunch spot.  The food was amazing and the service was excellent.  I had the salmon option that was perfectly prepared and portioned.  I also tried some of the family style mac and cheese that was spiced with a hint of jalapeno.  They offered a beer selection that included locals on tap.  The bread served was a light cheese bread, almost like a scone.  Water was served in nickel-like tumbler with crushed ice.  For dessert we shared a cookie skillet with coffee.  Two bites and I was satisfied.    I will definitely be back and would highly recommend this place.  My only complaint was that it was a bit loud, making dinner conversation a bit of a challenge.",

    "text": "One thing that put me off initially about The Summit Room is that no one answers the phone when you call - there is an automatic recording and no option to speak to someone, only to leave a message. I was calling to follow up on a reservation I requested online (and never heard back about whether I had it or not) and I was disappointed I couldn't actually speak to someone before arriving at the restaurant.   As far as first impressions, it is a quaint space that they use well. The front patio is lively and the spot to be on a warm spring/summer night. All the seats were taken and there was a wait for the patio, so my husband and I grabbed a table inside. The cucumber water they serve in the stainless steel glasses was delicious. Hidden gem - it definitely helps keep you hydrated. They have an amazing, boastful cocktail list that is fun and intriguing - with names after different mountains, you get in a fun mindset about choosing your drink. I started with the Mt Vinson with titos vodka, vanilla bean syrup, ginger beer and a cinnamon sugar orange wheel. The drink was good (I sure do love ginger beer) but I honestly didn't get much of a vanilla taste, which is why I ordered the unique drink in the first place. My husband had the peach bourbon he said was just okay.  For the food, we started with the sweet potato and mushroom flatbread and added pork belly. I will tell you that what was served wasn't exactly the flatbread that I pictured. It was a lot more doughier than your typical thin and crispy flatbread, which was what we had in mind. It was pretty salty, and I was also hoping for more of a sweet potato taste (deceiving flatbread name). The gouda was delicious because who doesn't love a cheesy piece of dough? But that was probably the highlight of that dish for me.  We also tried the shrimp bahn mi sliders, which may have been my favorite plate. They are served on a baguette sliced into smaller sliders, with a shrimp pattie (DELICIOUS), topped with some pork belly. The jalapeno relish really gives that zing of spice that takes over your taste buds, but it's a nice accompaniment to the sliders. I actually think it goes well with the flavors! I wasn't overly impressed with the pork belly - I think they were a little too crisp and not very flavorful.  Pro tip - the Mac n Cheese is a huge serving size. It could be a full meal. It comes with bacon (yum) and layers and layers of cheese - I would guess cheddar cheese. It comes served in a skillet so the cheese just melts throughout the dish. It is definitely very comforting, creamy and cheesy - all that you would want in a mac 'n cheese dish.  They definitely have a \"comfort\" food niche here - cornbread, mac n cheese, grits, collards, etc. available. I think it would be great to go with a group to split a variety of dishes, or just come for the cocktails. I think the food quality is average, but the atmosphere more than makes up for that. Service was a little slow. Overall, I'd give 3.5 stars.",

We were made feel really welcome. The menu is fun, not the typical Charlotte fare. Or if it is; then it has flair.  They have a unique and cool way to pre-order or play-forward a drink for friend.  The only drawback are the food prices; they are too high, even for Dilworth.",

We started with deviled eggs & hummus plate. All was unique and tasty! Pickled veggies on the hummus plate were delicious and crunchy! Oh the cheese scones were warm with crispy outside and tender center along with soft butter - they were melt in your mouth scrumptious!  Since I had read the mac & cheese was fabulous, I knew in the back of my mind I had to have it! So I opted for it and drunken mussels. Neither disappointed although I would have enjoyed more grilled bread with it. Delicious!!  My husband had the sliders which he said were pretty good. Friends got fries (which were wonderful, great seasoning) and another got brie stuffed hen.    Staff ensured we had full water glasses, wine was flowing, and all were friendly & attentive!  I can't wait to try it again and will probably get the farro risotto! I'm also anxious to try their sister lunch place, The Mayo Bird!",

I don't have a 2nd favorite cocktail spot) and friendly staff.  The waitress was very helpful and even gave us a list of \"dive\" restaurants to try in Charlotte.  Fidel is another reason I will be going back.  He always greets everyone with cheer and remembers you by name.  Try this place!!

For $14 we received a small rectangular plate of approximately 10 neatly aligned nacho chips of which 3-4 had no toppings and all of which had scant amounts of lobster meat and were served cold; I suppose we were expecting a hot messy plate of nachos (regardless of how much lobster meat was included).  The burger was good but came with a bag of prepackaged chips for $14. For a place of this caliber and the price of the burger, we expected more than a bag of prepackaged chips as a side; especially with Bad Daddy's located across the street. Atmosphere and staff were great and I'm sure the rent is high on East Blvd. forcing them to increase food prices, but we were overall disappointed with the small portions and high prices.",

The Brussels sprouts are probably the best I've ever tasted, deviled eggs with pickled onions on top were a real surprise but very good.  The desserts are awesome and the drinks are great too.  I love the charm of the decor, a southern charm but yet you feel like you could be at a cute little spot in Colorado.  It is small so make reservations or arrive early before 7 on the weekdays. After 7 your going to have a tough time finding a table or bar seat.  Great location, great staff and great food!",

    "text": "Holy sweet potato empanada!   So, I finally went to try The Summit Room out and I ended up back there three days later because i just HAD to have more sweet potato empanadas. (Get them, I swear, you'll be happy).   I like the vibe of this place, nice but not stuffy, good crowd, nice wait staff. It wouldn't break my heart if it was a little bigger, I went on a Saturday at first and it feels pretty packed pretty quickly.   Now, food. In my two visits I feel like I've already had a good amount of food from here. Clearly I love the empanadas. The mussels were fantastic, the broth was so delicious, right amount, tasty garlic bread - officially in the running for my favorite mussels in town. The Pork Belly/Shrimp Sliders - very very good, fun flavors, a little small. I get the slider thing but the second time we ordered them, I felt like all I was eating was bread and I was a bit disappointed. They are fantastic though and a must try. We also tried the Summit burger, it was good, simple, a very good amount of burger, tasty - If I wanted a burger, I wouldn't hesitate to eat theirs. We also had the brussels sprouts - these were delicious. A little maple and buttery and I ate them all in just a few bites. Great side dish to a meal. Finally we had the Uno Alla Volta Burrata - yes, please, get it! It was so fresh and so fantastic - I only wished there was more. If you like mozzarella, you have to try this dish, it melts right on the plate and in your mouth. Only thing with the cheese is that I wish it came with bread, so much so that I was really surprised and confused that it didn't and asked our waitress for some.   All in all, I have really enjoyed my food at Summit Room so far and I look forward to trying a few more plates. The only thing that's keeping me from 5 stars is that I do think it's a bit overpriced. I feel like these plates could easily all start $5-8 lower. Either way, I will be back for my empanadas.",

This place was hopping on a Saturday night with well dressed young people.  Lots of lively conversation and a diverse clientele.  Shane (reviewer 3/4/2017)was right on all the way around including the noise.  We had a beautiful evening and ate on the patio under the lights, the owner brought out a couple of blankets and lit the gas heaters.  So, why only three stars?  They just changed the menu and the offerings are a bit skimpy.  They were sold out of three of the appetizers and, for entre's there was a burger, salmon, lamb ribs, ratatouille and game hens.  Maybe they were short handed because the service and the food came out very slow.  Wish they'd given us a few more of the yummy \"cheese scones\" to hold us over for dinner.  Burgers were all ordered medium or medium rare and sadly, mine was so rare the meat was red and cool and inedible.  The fries were alittle tough and soggy, probably cooked in a large batch an hour before, and therefore didn't make up for the raw meat burger.  We sent it back, but it didn't come back out until everyone else was finished.  The ratatouille was good, but a bit skimpy for a veggie dish.  I hope this was an unusual evening because I'd really like to go back and try it again.",
