Although the menu is quite slim, they do offer the necessities.   Seating is limited to about 4 benches so be prepared to take it to go. Being it's a take out joint, in True fashion they deliver. Mega points there for one of the few delivery restaurants in the area. Not to mention sushi!",

Monday: 10% off special rolls Tuesday: Free drink with your order of $10 or more Wednesday: Free drink with your order of $10 or more (delivery not included) Thursday: 20% off all nigiri and sashimi Friday: 20% off special rolls (5pm-9:30pm) Saturday: 20% off all orders Sunday: 20% off with valid student id **All specials exclude combo and fax orders.  I thought it would be a nice little walk to KO, but the area is pretty ghetto and deserted at night. I got asked for spare change EEK! I would recommend just getting take out, besides they don't have indoor seating anyway and delivery is just $1.  Love how generous they are with the seaweed salad. Wish the sashimi was a little cheaper, but still a good dinner option. For some reason I can't get my order under $20 ever. It's still a solid and affordable sushi option.",

Delivery required $20 minimum, but was speedy and easy. I got the Tiger Roll, Dynamite roll, and an eel roll. I was hungry, so ate them all!! My favorite was the Tiger roll. It was a fancier, tasty roll, but nothing to write home about. The dynamite roll was a bit sweet for my liking, but it was still good. The eel roll was blah - very mediocre.  I enjoyed the convenience of delivery, but this is no fine dining and this is no \"great sushi\" if you're a foody. It's just like picking up sushi from Kroger or Publix, or maybe slightly worse.  Not sure why so many great reviews, since it's so mediocre.",

There's only a high top bar area in a crowded space, so don't plan on sitting and eating here, the entire place is organized to be take out only.  Also - good luck navigating their website, that thing could use some help - it took me 10 minutes to find their phone number!  Tips:  They've got a promotion now where if you buy $8 worth of sushi they'll give you a free can of soda.  They also have a frequent flyer card where you can get a discount if you repeat visit so often.",

I usually just walk in the store and order, and it usually takes around 10 minutes to prepare it, similar to other takeout joints.   I am a huge fan of their special Fireworks rolls. It's got so many fresh, good ingredients, such as tempura shrimp, cucumber, other fish (I can't remember), and thick, grilled tuna wrapped around the sushi rice, topped off with their sweet soy sauce! It's very rich and full of unique flavors.    Also, try their octopus salad. It's a good compliment with your sushi.  I would also recommend their Charlotte or K.O. combo which includes nigiri.   For the quality and price, it is a great value  I have not tried their \"hot\" food yet, such as udon or hasaki plates, but I will keep you all posted.",

I've been to Niko, which does have a great environment and good sushi, but it didn't blow me away.  Also, sometimes I'm just not up for all that after a long day, which is why I tried KO.   Now my rating is partially based in food and on convenience because there is no eating in here. As for the food, I would say 3.5 stars, as I didn't like the spicy tuna, but the salmon and yellowtail were great-very fresh tasting! Also the seaweed salad was good but had a little too much dressing on it for my taste, it should be a cleaner taste in my opinion but all in all a good takeout/delivery option at the end of the day.   What got this place to 4 stars for me was the online ordering. I absolutely hate calling anywhere and placing an order over the phone and I'm glad to see that sushi has followed pizza by participating in online ordering. It's not that the people aren't nice or pleasant (the staff was actually quite pleasant during my pick up) but I just don't like calling, so this place makes me very happy and I will definitely be ordering sushi online again from KO.",

Went to K.O with a friend tonight- we ordered 4 rolls to split between the two of us spicy tuna, firework, Hiro, and Dragon. My total with a coke zero and 15% student discount (grad school is good for something : ) ) came to $14. The amount of food was crazy, we really should have stuck to three.   The eat-in area is basically two stools and a counter- it was extremely uncomfortable. What made things worse is that we had to wait 40 minutes for our food! We had to check in a couple times and were more than a little miffed that it took that long and that we weren't pre-warned.   Once our food came out the mood lightened up because we were in cheap sushi heaven! I was extremely impressed with the quality and freshness -you simply cannot beat the price! We barely finished our rolls but we did manage to stuff the last one down...again 3 rolls would have absolutely sufficed as I am in a food coma currently.   Both of us enjoyed the Hiro roll the best - but all four tasted great.  I will be back...for take out only.",

    "text": "This is a no frills sushi place.  They are primarily a take-out or delivery sushi place.  There are two small stools near a counter window if you're really needing to stay.  The menu is pretty limited to the mainstays of the American sushi scene.  Don't expect anything fancy on it.  Their seaweed salad was priced cheaper than I expected but somehow it had a salty taste, just slightly, it threw me off as odd.  The calamari salad was also cheap and tasted very good.  I tried some of the salmon and yellowtail rolls as well as ordered a sushi of salmon and yellowtail.  At first I thought the price of the sushi was kinda high for a single piece;  $2.50  But when I saw the sushi, the fish was a big piece, so I was much happier with the price.  Both the sushi pieces tasted better than the rolls to me.  Next time I'm just going to order straight up sushi and not the rolls.  I will say the maki rolls were decent sized in diameter, certainly not your smaller variety.  Quality was OK to good.  I think their fish is reasonably fresh.  They do focus on the mainstays, so they try not to have much to carryover.  In fact, I think I noticed they have a 50% discount after a certain time...was it 3 pm? of any fish left in the cooler, so that they do get a good turnaround.  Overall, I'd say good in a pinch.  I'd put it on par as freshly made grocery store sushi.  Which is definitely a step above grocery store sushi as sushi that sits in the cooler for a while is yucky as the rice hardens.  And the price is reasonable, though I wouldn't go as far to say cheap, but then...do you really want to try cheap sushi?",

Tilapia is absolutely nowhere on the menu, but, for some reason, she said \"tilapia\". Why would she say that? When I asked her to repeat it again, she said \"snapper\" the second time.  I'm very familiar with both types of fish and both, in sashimi form, look almost identical. The flavor was extremely close to tilapia and upon further investigation and discussion with my wife, we're 99% certain we were given tilapia. Look up images of snapper and tilapia sashimi and see what you think.  I wouldn't have a problem with getting tilapia instead of snapper if they told me that I was getting a sub and adjusted the price for the cheaper grade of fish. There is a very, very slight chance that I really did get snapper, but the fact that she said \"tilapia\" leads me to believe that I didn't and that they use tilapia as a sub for snapper and customers aren't made aware of that.  Anyway, the rolls that I've tried along with most of the sashimi are good. For fast food sushi, it's not too bad.  I just have a problem with restaurants who assume diners won't know the subtle differences in specific ingredients. Another reviewer mentioned getting a cheaper ingredient subbed for a premium one in his soup. Therefore, it seems like this is a common practice at this spot.",

    "text": "KO has my favorite sushi in Charlotte. It's quick and easy, but they don't sacrifice freshness or flavor.  KO is a go to lunch place for my coworkers and me in uptown. It's take out only, but it's enjoyable to head over to Wells Fargo and eat or easy to bring back to the office. I love their lunch specials: free soda with purchase over $7, 50% off a $20 purchase on your birthday, and the lunch box combo, which gives you more pieces than a regular roll, but not as much as two rolls, which is just the right amount. And it's about $7 to $8, which is super affordable.  My new favorite thing is to call them before I leave the office, and then swing by to pick up dinner on my way home.  Don't be fooled because it's just a take out sushi place. So far, it's the best sushi I've have in Charlotte.  (the only downside is for delivery, you need to order $30 or more).",

Add the spicy mayo, please. I go in, place the order, they make it, and its to me in 5 minutes. It's a no thrill place. Carryout only. And they don't prepare in front of you. The place is small, and they had to make room the best they could. I saw a few comments about that. If there is an event, good luck parking close. And construction is making it hard. I've risked illegally parking before and been lucky. But I have also skipped the place cuz I couldn't find parking close.",

I should caveat the service by saying I usually grab lunch outside the typical 12 o'clock hour for obvious reasons, but I know you can call ahead to avoid waiting altogether.

Not only are we both incredibly happy with our respective rolls, but the cashier remembers our regular order in a nice and not at all creepy way.   Make a single good decision for once in your pathetic life and go to KO. Tell them that weird couple who come in every week sent you.

There are no tables or anything to even sit on while you wait for your order.

Because it's delicious and fresh, the menu has lots of options, has easy online ordering and all at a great cost. It's a take out spot meaning there's no room for fancy decor or chairs even. So you shouldn't take your date here. But the small square footage affords them low overhead which in turn allows them to price their product accordingly. At least that's my hypothesis. The lines are out the door during the work week lunch rush so order well ahead of time and still be ready for a wait. Any other time, order online and 20 minutes later you'll be stuffing your face with delicious fish wrapped in rice goodness. 4 rolls will cost your around $25-30 and will feed 2 people or 1 really greedy person who wants left overs.",

Happy tummy- we crammed into a corner - so the only negative isn't really their fault - they are a take-out and delivery place - not a sit down restaurant - but the quality of the food is that of a sit-down/more expensive restaurant. A plus - my 9yo and 6yo loved their rolls and the udon.",

    "text": "Very pleasantly surprised with this place that I had never even heard of a week ago. A friend told me about it, so I decided to give it a try despite the modest Yelp rating.  The ordering process was extremely convenient. It was very simple to order online, and you're even given the option of customizing your roll by adding extra ingredients. I didn't take advantage of customizing this time, but I'm sure I will in the future.  I'm always drawn to the specialty rolls, and the first thing I noticed here were the very affordable prices...there were a few specialty rolls for as little as $5.25 and many more for $6.50 or less. I decided to get one relatively expensive roll and one cheaper roll.  My more expensive roll was the Magma Roll for $8.50. It had two pieces of shrimp tempura and crab with baked spicy crab salad on top. This roll was amazing! It came with 8 pieces, and with all the crab salad on top, looked quite formidable. To be honest, I probably could have called it quits after just this roll, but alas, I'm a glutton for sushi.  The cheaper roll I ordered was the Hiro Roll for $6.50. This one had shrimp tempura, masago, spicy mayo, avocado, crab, and cream cheese. Though not quite as good as the Magma Roll, it was still very delicious, and for $2 less was probably better value. It came with only 6 pieces, but the pieces were huge. My girlfriend called out my faux pas of not eating each piece in one bite.  I will definitely be back to check out some of the other specialty rolls (and get crazy with adding new ingredients).  UPDATE: Enjoyed K.O. so much last time, it took me less than a week to return. This time I ordered the Bagel Roll for $8.50. It came with 9 big pieces and had crab, cream cheese, and avocado with salmon and more avocado on top.  Loved this roll just as much as the Magma and Hiro. The pieces of salmon were extremely generous...I can't believe how much fish you get for such a low price!  UPDATE: Tried a new roll today. This time I ordered the Hung Roll with baked salmon, avocado, cream cheese, and jalapeno. There were 10 pieces for an incredibly inexpensive $5.25. It was probably my least favorite of the four rolls, but it was still quite good.  UPDATE: Tried two new rolls today. The first was the Fireworks Roll. It had two pieces of shrimp tempura, crab, cucumber, tobiko, and torched spicy tuna on top with special sauce. It was really good...I loved how crunchy it was. However, at almost $10, it's the most expensive roll on the menu, and to be honest, I think there's better value with the cheaper rolls.  The second roll I ordered was the Stormy Roll. It had crab, shrimp, avocado and a choice of cream cheese or cucumber. It was cheap at only $5.25, but it was the most boring roll I've had from K.O....I don't think I would get it again.  UPDATE: Tried the Tempura Roll today. Nothing really to write home about, but very good value for the low price of $5.50. It came with 8 ample pieces, and the spicy mayo had just the right amount of kick.  UPDATE: Tried the Crunchy Roll and the Shrimp Shumai. The shumai was decent, but I think I'll stick to sushi from now on. The crunchy roll was similar quality to what I've had at Harris Teeter, but for less than half the price. 10 pieces for $5.50 is truly an incredible deal.  UPDATE: Ordered two basic rolls today: Tekka (Tuna) and Salmon. There was a very generous amount of fish in each roll, but it wasn't the freshest tasting fish I've had. The salmon roll was slightly better.",

Only suggestion, order ahead and avoid going in at noon on weekdays, place is super busy and you have to wait and not really any standing room so you're crammed in. Worth the wait but I would recommend getting there before the lunch rush.",

Let me just say that the pricing here is wonderful for what you get!  The sushi is delicious, tasty and very fresh.  I had a Chubby roll and a Fireworks roll.  Both were amazing.  I ordered a large edamame not realizing how LARGE the portion would be.  I now have edamame for days!!!  I'm thrilled to know there's quick sushi uptown at such a reasonable price.  Looking forward to satisfying my next sushi roll craving here!  Thanks, KO Sushi!",

They are a small sushi take out place with maybe for high chairs in case you want to dine in. They have a pretty decent menu and their prices are great. I decided to go with tempura shrimp and shrimp dumplings, the food got ready quite fast considering that when I arrived, there were more people waiting for their order. I loved my sushi! They were fresh and their size was perfect, 8 pieces of delicious sushi! The dumplings were really good and what I loved the most about them was the spicy sauce they were marinated in. I highly recommend this spot for some cheap, fast, delicious sushi :)",

    "text": "Sushi!! Look, let me start off and say how much I love sushi. 1-2 years ago, I wouldn't even touch it. I was missing out for sure. I'm always down to try sushi anywhere (okay, maybe not the gas station sushi). I also work uptown and there are several places near my job that have sushi, even closer than KO.  I decided to take a stroll to KO and pass by my normal sushi place to see how they were, since there always seems to be a line. I placed my order online in advance and I still ended up waiting in line to check in and pay. I have also ordered in person to compare the wait time difference and the online ordering does seem to be slightly faster, but not deal breaking fast.   I always seem to go for the fried seafood in my rolls and I went with the Tempura roll. Unlike most tempura rolls that just have Shrimp tempura and some veggies, they have shrimp, crab, spicy mayo and masago. No veggies! Which, let me tell you, is awesome for me. I don't really like avocado and a lot of sushi has it, but I normally just deal with it. The sushi is some of the best that I've had and I'm kicking myself for not coming sooner.  I also tried the Shrimp Shumai appetizer. The ones I've had at other places uptown very always fried. These were not. However, these were so good. The best I've had so far. Whatever the special sauce is, it's amazing and special to my heart.   The price. Being in uptown you always expect prices to be higher and KO is not only inexpensive, but they are the cheapest I've had in the city. I've picked up some orders for my boss as well and he said it's also some of the best he's had and he came from San Francisco where I've heard they have amazing sushi.   If you are in the area or just want some good sushi, do yourself a flavor and go there ASAP! The lunch rush is around 12-1, so avoid that time, but if you are on a lunch break, the wait isn't terrible like most places.",

I like KO because they're convenient, the food is good and you get a bang for your buck :) They are always packed during lunch, good sign right!   They have lunch specials, spend $7 and get a free drink. They have combo boxes. They have birthday specials 50% off. Their menu is ridiculously inexpensive. So getting to $7 will at least get you 2 rolls or a roll and a meal (the meal includes a gyoza appetizer). Like really? Why not.  Try em out!",

I usually order online and am able to pick up and get in and out within five minutes. Even when it's the lunch rush, they go through and handle orders to the level that is done at my local McDonalds. They're quick, friendly and offer quality food. What's not to love?   FOOD The food is incredible. It's no frills so don't expect crazy sushi rolls, but they do offer some cool combos. My go to is the Charlotte Combo, which comes with a roll of choice and some nigiri. For $9.50, it's the best deal in town for some quality sushi. I also love the Anything roll, which is $6.50 last time I checked. If you love jalapeno and cilantro, this roll is for you. Nothing satiates a savory craving than that roll! The prices are so affordable and the food is always DELICIOUS.",

    "text": "My husband just told me I need to update my review for KO as I, literally, go to KO once a week for lunch!! I have also Postmates ordered it for dinner here and there.   I nicknamed KO, Knockout sushi, because it is exactly what I want from a to go sushi place (no tables inside). Quick. Cheap. Simple. Friendly.   I have gone through rounds of my go to roll. First it was the Hiro Roll. Then Perfect Match was my roll of choice. Next, it was Dragon. Currently, my roll of choice is spicy tuna. The chef mixes some sauce in so it's a bit different than the typical tuna roll with spicy mayo on top. Usually I get a small edamame with it or a mini salad with ginger. I have also tried the salmon and tuna shashimi and it always tastes so fresh.   Service is what puts KO over the top. The same lady is always behind the counter. Despite there being 15 people in the small restaurant waiting on orders and the phone ringing, she always remembers that I don't like cucumber and I don't need soy sauce. That's service.   KO, I'll be back....in a few days!   Pro Tip- Any order over $7 gets a free drink Pro Pro tip- For the Mon-Fri Uptown worker crowd, go at 11 am or 2 pm or plan on waiting 20-30 minutes....or call ahead!",

Delivery guys/gals are always pleasant and arrive on their mopeds rain or shine or snow. Sushi is really good for delivery. It's cheap and they even have combo platters for a discount. I usually go with the #11, which comes with 2 basic maki rolls for $7. Spicy tuna and spicy veggie call are the choices. I then order the shrimp tempura and godzilla roll. Make sure to specify how many sets of chopsticks you need as well as your soy choice...fully leaded or low sodium. Order usually arrives in under 45 minutes. Well worth the wait!",

The sushi is always fresh (lovee the Rainbow Roll) and they even have specials! Their rolls are pretty big and you can customize them if you want (like adding toppings on a pizza). The best part is that you can order online and by the time you get home from a hard day's work, they are already at your door.

    "text": "Hubs and I stumbled onto this little gem very soon after we moved to Charlotte a few years ago. Since we lived in the Fourth Ward at the time, we were thrilled to try sushi delivery just a few streets down.   We've since ordered KO (delivered to our house - just a mile south of Uptown in South End) and every time we get it, the sushi is basic, but fresh and delish! The delivery guy is always nice and he definitely works hard in the rain on his moped to ensure that we get our food in an adequate amount of time. I don't think we've ever waited more than 45 minutes for our food and the one time it was sub-par (wrong items and jumbled from the ride over), they very kindly comped our next order.   I would recommend the shrimp tempura roll, spicy tuna roll, spicy veggie roll and the Godzilla roll (my personal fave). Per some other reviews, definitely pay attention to the specials - they make this little spot even more affordable than it already is! Just make sure you hit the minimums required for lunch or dinner orders...we never have that problem as we typically eat our weight in sushi.   Yay for KO.",

On there website every item had descriptions so I knew what I was getting myself into and I didn't have to encounter any miscommunication issues which typically arise when ordering over the phone.   the delivery guy appeared 30 minutes after I placed my order. They have a delivery minimum of $15 and they charge a $1 delivery fee. I deducted one star because I think they can either charge the minimum or the delivery fee, but it's really like .5 star because its not a bad minimum or a bad fee. So cheers to them.   I ordered yellow tail sashimi, the hurricane roll, and the KO roll. My favorite was the yellow tail sashimi; it was fresh and I will definitely order more next time. It was only one piece which sucks but it was a large cut. And it was served on a bed of thinly sliced cucumber which was not only nice presentation but a good little snack.   They give you nice chopsticks (they seemed nicer then the normal ones) and a little soy sauce dish (wrapped in the napkin).   I will be ordering from this place MANY more times in the future and if they keep up their level of service and quality I see a 5 star update in their future :)",

I called them through the afternoon, and when I finally got someone, he said their hours were 4:30pm to something like 9pm. I don't even know. So confusing.  There is only street-parking, and no place to sit inside, as well as no bathroom. Patrons get around this by sitting on the floor as they wait for their sushi. The sushi itself is fairly decent quality.

And all of you sushi lovers know how that goes, you could not think about sushi for weeks, but the minute it pops into your head you MUST have it. So we decided to try KO. Like morons, we decided we'd walk over and get it. 20 minutes and one broken umbrella later, soaking wet, we made it back and dug in. We were very impressed!  First and most importantly, the fish and all of the other items inside the rolls were very fresh. We ordered 4 of the special rolls and loved them all, especially the volcano roll - so tasty! Be aware, though - some of these rolls are HUGE! Took a few tries to fit it all in my mouth!   The miso soup was, well, miso soup (can't really go wrong here, let's face it we are eating seaweed and tofu). The Crunchy Roll was also delicious, as well as the Panthers Roll. The sauces that were put on them made the roll, gave it a little kick. Prices were what you would expect - anywhere from $5 to $9 for the specialty rolls and $4 maki rolls. My only suggestion would be for them to offer more speical rolls to choose from!",

It's a small place with only two stools for seating, so you'll definitely want to get it to go or have it delivered. The selection of rolls is pretty standard, but varied enough for my tastes. The maki rolls are about 4 bucks, and their \"special\" rolls are about twice that. Maki rolls are pretty much the size you would expect. We picked up a few of those, along with a special roll -Rainbow- that was nice and plump.  The quality was pretty good. The fish tasted fresh and the sauces were tasty. I thought the rice was very slightly undercooked because it was a little looser than expected, but that's really a very minor issue that will probably vary from day to day.   Overall, I'm pretty happy with it. It's great to have a take-out sushi place downtown. I'm sure I will be going back there many times.",
