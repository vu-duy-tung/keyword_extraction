I mean, what else do you need?  We've gone more than ten times  in the last few years, and they catered my birthday recently.   The sushi is quite fresh - the white tuna is awesome, and the tempura fried spicy tuna rolls are a real value. We are always glad to see folks patronizing the joint - being located in a strip mall near Target, it isn't well placed. But like us, it seems others have discovered what a value it is.  Are there better sushi restaurants in Charlotte? Sure. But none this close to home or this inexpensive.",

The manager was unsympathetic and said sweet carrots are not guarantee and come with hibachi to \"make look pretty.\" Unbelievable!

However, at this place not at all! The avocado that was on top was biter (going bad) the brown on top was covered by eel sauce, once I pulled it off they were a little better, the taste of cream cheese was over powering that was all you tasted, no eel nothing! Would have loved for the waiter that saw what I was doing bc she talked about to other man, but never asked if everything was ok if there was anything she could do. I will not be back! I am still searching for good sushi in NC!",

After finishing our last meal my partner and I waited 30 minutes until the waitress came to check up on us. We wanted to go boxes but that took her forever. We had to wait for our check so we went up to the waitress and just wanted her to charge us right there and right now. We were the only customers there. I don't see why we had to waste 2 hours.   Few month later a friend wanted to head out for lunch at Edomae. I must say, that was my very last time to ever stand foot in that place. A waiter served me water and after drinking about 1/4 of it I stopped and explained to my waiter my concern. He confirmed that he accidentally served bleach water. I thought it was a prank, a joke, but it surely was. The taste still in my mouth. Edomae you just lost a customer.",

    "text": "It's a wonder how two people can have such different reviews even when they go to the same place at the same time sometimes isn't it? Stopped by here for a weekday dinner with my bro bro Jonathon B. and I left feeling a bit neglected.  Walking in reception is warm enough, but that's probably cause one of us is a regular here (not me). My friend ordered a salad and it came out speedily and tasty enough. I've never been a fan of the ginger dressing salads served at most Japanese restaurants though. Probably due to my dislike of iceberg lettuce. Then it took a long while before our sushi selections came out. That's okay because we're chatting it up and being all chill, also we noticed that there was only one person rolling sushi behind the counter for the whole joint. Poor guy! So finally our rolls finally came out and I had ordered a specialty roll and a standard roll. I like to do this because sometimes fancy schmancy rolls either turn out great or a total bust and I need something you can't really mess up as sushi insurance. In this case my dragon something roll ended up kind of meh. Eel is already pretty fatty and pairing it with avocado was just overdoing it and resulted in very little textural contrast at all in the roll. The flavor was decent at least. The crunchy salmon roll on the other hand was great, nice little crunch, fresh tasting salmon, excellent all around!  The service once seated is slooow, I'm not even referring to the speed food came out at since I decided to give them a free pass on that. It took a bit to get our server's attention to order another dish and then quite a lot longer after that to get our checks. It wasn't that busy with only 2-3 tables there so either I need a chill pill or someone needs to get their head in the game. The meal overall was a bit more expensive than I would have liked for a casual night out, let's just stick to Wednesdays next time when the sushi is half off kay?",

I'm not sure why there was so much broccoli and zucchini in the soup. None of the \"normal\" veggies  I'm use to were In the soup. At least the noodles were only slightly under cooked. Though the poor texture clearly couldn't conceal that the noodles were cheap prepackage noodles. Unfortunately I can't even imagine trying this place again in the future.",

    "text": "~~ here we go with another one of my long reviews! :)  ~~ Ok kids, I'll admit that my expectations of this place were kind of low going in. I just assumed it was another one of these \"wanna be\" Japanese express-style places, that survive solely on location since good Japanese restaurants aren't plentiful in Charlotte.  However, I must say I was pleasantly surprised by Edomae.  They're no Kabuto, but they'll suffice.  The interior was surprisingly non-theme-y....you know, where it looks like they just vomited all the obligatory kitsch they could find thinking we as the public somehow won't believe that we're eating Asian food if we aren't looking at all the golden swing-arm cats, bamboo calendars and kimono drawings they could find.  Instead, it was very contemporary, with juuust the right amount of Asian flair mixed in.  I appreciated that - good job!  The men's room was also nice with decorative mosaic tile work like a home bath and very very CLEAN!!!  May seem strange to talk about the rest room, but you know how THAT can go; at a lot of places you don't really wanna touch anything & the endless caulking around the sink is growing mold!  I see you shaking your head :)  Anyhoo, let's move on to the FOOD.  It was quite yummy I must admit.  My partner and I both enjoyed our lunches.  I had the chicken & shrimp hibachi combo and he had the chicken & steak combo.  Each came with rice and a salad (which automatically comes w/ginger dressing, but you can get another type if that's not your thing).  We also shared a Miso soup which was quite yummy with bits of seaweed and tofu.  I went with the ginger dressing as usual & found theirs to be a bit on the sweet side (I like a bit more of that ginger 'kick'), but it was still tasty, and they add cucumber in their salad instead of just lettuce.    The real disappointment here was their portion sizes - rather small for the price.  For instance, I only had three shrimp on my plate...three.   A half-way decent amount of chicken.  The veggies were also rather miniscule as well.  The other half said his well done steak was really quite tender & tasty, but would have liked more.  For about the same price ($11 for mine) I get QUITE a bit more at Kabuto (University location); there's no room to move the food around on the plate there, whereas here there was LOTS of room on the plate.  Sure the flower was nice to look at, but...    Oh, I almost forgot.  I thought this was a cross between funny and odd - they bring a syrup container full of shrimp sauce (you know, the pink dipping sauce you always get), but the sauce is so thick it was very difficult to get it OUT of the container!  An IHOP style container of shrimp sauce was just too funny to me.    Would we eat here again?  Yes (primarily b/c of convenience since it's close to the house.  Is it worth the price?  Eh, not really, since most every other place gives much more food - BUT, if you're in the Northlake area & are craving Japanese, then it IS a good option.",

    "text": "Traveling through Charlotte on my way to points north, and then back home to Atlanta, I had the pleasure of dining at Edomae twice in the last two weeks.  Located conveniently close to my sister's home, it was an easy dining pick since we all love sushi.  But if you don't, there are plenty of thoroughly cooked items on the menu to enjoy, including a large hibachi grill section.  The edamame is a nice starter, although the second time it was a tad on the salty side.  No worries, since Edomae recently secured their liquor license and they offer beer, wine, and sake.  If you're a sashimi fan, you won't go wrong here.  The fish I ordered tasted fresh and the quality of the sashimi and sushi is higher than the fish used in the rolls.  Not that the rolls are bad - not at all - but if you're like me, you'll get the sashimi appetizer along with one or two of your favorite rolls and call it a meal. I'm partial to eel, but the tuna rolls are also quite good.  Edomae has a long list of special rolls, and some work better than others, but every one I tasted was good.  My favorites include the Naudy Roll (made with eel, tuna, avocado) and the Green Dragon Roll (eel, cucumber, and avocado).  My sister likes the Krayln Roll (Tempura, scallops, asparagus, and masago).  I didn't try any of the hibachi dishes, but the chicken and scallops looked appetizing and were served with soup, salad, vegetables and a choice of fried rice or noodles.  A huge amount of food, reasonably priced.  If you're in the area, this is definitely a place to check out for lunch or dinner.  Enjoy!",

The second time, tonight, is a Friday night it was just about full and they seemed to be missing some staff.  The table across from me waited on a plate, and maybe it was a bit slow though not enough to irritate me, my gyoza was a little lukewarm though still good, but the tempura was great, and my udon noodle soup was everything I wanted.  The vegetable roll was tasty with a mix of veg.  My friends had two of the seafood rolls and both enjoyed then as well.  It's a solid place to go in my book.",

I looked up the report and there were violations for employee behavior (not washing before putting on gloves; using the gloves to open doors, etc. along with other violations that I attribute to lack of tracking).

Thought we were off to a great start , but that was the beginning and the end. I ordered hibachi chicken and the sweet potato sushi roll. My friend also got the hibachi chicken and a philly roll. Sushi was good. Our entree came and it was okay. It wasn't the best hibachi I've ever had. Lots of food however. Our waiter forgot to bring our soup and salad and brought them over the soup was already cold. The salad wasn't too great either. Would go back for the sushi as it was very good but probably wouldn't go back for any meal.",

The service was a little on the slow side and a couple that say after we did somehow got their food first. Overlooking that, the sushi lunch was very fresh and tasty. For $12+tip I got 6 pieces of sushi and subbed a salmon avocado roll. The miso soup they brought out first could've been a little warmer but overall everything tasted pretty good.

I waited for 40 mins before noticing that an eel order that looked like mine had been sitting on a plate at the kitchen counter for a while. I asked about it and it was mine, they forgot about it being to go. It took them another 30 mins to put the dang food in a box for me to take. I was intent on never going there again, but decided to give them another chance today. I ordered udon soup and some roe sashimi. I got home and found that they gave me salmon instead, after charging me for the roe. Not impressed with the way overpriced food and lacking customer service. I won't be going back this time. I'll just stick to Yoshi's grill in Huntersville.",

The prices are slightly less at lunchtime, but they could stand to add 2-4 more shrimp. The service was adequate and they were patient when we took a more time than normal to order. Overall, I'd recommend Edomae. No surprises for the better or worse.",

My only complain is when online ordering, they don't look at the 'special instructions'. Not a huge deal, but it would be nice if they read it. I don't think my request is difficult by any means.

The lady who seated us told us about the special, \"half off sushi.\" Well, count us in!  Between the two of us, we got three rolls a piece. I opted for the spider roll, spicy crunchy crab roll & the ninja roll. I also got the clear soup. In no time, my soup was brought out & a few minutes later, our sushi arrived. Every roll tasted fresh & the ingredients were delicious.  The place was clean, servers were attentive and efficient. Prices are very reasonable.  They offer hibachi, which I will have to try on my next visit.  Parking is an issue, since they share the area with many other businesses. They do offer reservations (the restaurant itself is pretty small). Another bonus: you can order online.",

So after eating like a human trash can this weekend...my body was in need of something light, delicious and budget friendly. Not sure what it is about sushi that fills your stomach or your soul but let me tell you! My spicy tuna roll and sweet potato roll provided a soul awaken experience for lunch. Sweet potato roll was crunchy but light. While my spicy tuna roll delivered the right punch of heat and flavor! Topped off with my personal mix of wasabi and soy and EXTRA pickled ginger. Edomae is one of the best sushi spots in Charlotte!",

That is bad business, who are you trying to kid? Tofu is literally the cheapest protein you can buy! Lol! An organic tofu block is $2 sometimes less and I know you're not using organic, lol! So you're getting your GMO tofu for pennies and you're trying to sell it for $12! Lol! Your restaurant is a joke! Not to mention there is hair and dust everywhere and it reeks of rotting fish! Dust and hair even on the plates of food and they serve greasy spring rolls that drip oil and they only contain cabbage! Another cheap filler you're charging way too much for!

On my most recent visit, I tried the teriyaki shrimp lunch special which came with fried rice, mixed vegetables, and choice of salad or miso soup. My meal came with about 5 pieces of shrimp. Now, I'm used to the notion that most Chinese/Asian restaurants do not believe in being \"generous\" with shrimp but I was most disappointed in the fact that the fried rice was not good. It was dry and had no flavor.  Simply put, I was not satisfied with my meal that time or any other time and do not feel like it's a place that I will need to visit anytime soon.",

Their gyoza are atrocious- I think they're either bought frozen or the filling is made in a meat grinder (you should have some ability to taste what vegetables and meats were put in the filling, not have some mystery paste in a rice wrapper). The salad dressing is good, very mild for a ginger, but one of the saving graces of the meal. Our sushi was terrible; the rice was dried out and unseasoned (for those new to sushi, the rice is supposed to be lightly seasoned with mirin vinegar), and the fish cuts were tiny. They must have run out of cream cheese the other night because they put tofu in my Philly roll instead (um....not the same flavor). I had the shrimp hibachi, and the shrimp were large and properly grilled. I enjoyed the vegetables. My husband unfortunately had the chicken and steak hibachi. He asked for his steak to be medium, and it was virtually rubber. The chicken was dry and lacked in flavor.  Top that off with the horrible service ( it took 25 minutes from the time they cleared our plates until we received our check and only two other tables were occupied), and this time I vow never to return.",

Well, the server answered incorrectly for both rolls as they both came out the opposite of what he told me.  They brought my boyfriend's chicken hibachi dinner out, and I waited for about ten minutes before checking on my sushi. Their response was that they had a large sushi order before me. That is totally fine and understandable, but they shouldn't have brought out his food when my sushi wasn't even started. I ordered a glass of wine that was never brought to the table. When I reminded the server of this as I asked about my sushi order, he didn't offer to bring it out, comp it, or anything. (I never got it). This place was a big disappointment and we will not be returning. The hibachi chicken dinner was bland, sushi was OK, but with no offer to comp food, give us a coupon, or truly apologize for the long wait and botched service, I'm taking my money elsewhere!",
