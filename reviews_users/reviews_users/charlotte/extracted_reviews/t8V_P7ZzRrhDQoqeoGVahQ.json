We didn't make reservations so we had about an hour wait...which was okay because we just headed upstairs for a few beers.  When we were sat down it was immediately apparent that they were extremely understaffed. Someone mentioned that they were not expecting to be so busy (even though the hostess said that the are fully booked for the month). ?? We didn't let this bother us because Darren, our waiter was incredible. He was split between back of house and waiting but continually took his time to not make us feel rushed. He even took time to show us the beer room and take some pictures of us throughout the resteraunt. Darren is a True professional.  The food....we had one of the cheese plates with the gouda, boar meat and prosciutto. We also got the lemon risotto for an appetizer. The main course was the grouper and a steak. All of the food was outstanding and exceeded our expectations.  This place is on the expensive side but the quality is there to match. Definitely will be back.",

As you walk down the stairs you're greeted by a hostess who leads you through a sliding wooden door into a dark quaint room. There are plenty of booths and tables and also a small bar that offers delicious cocktails. They have an ipad that lists the wines and champagnes that are available. The servers are amazing and super helpful. We always get the truffle fries that are sprinkled with parsley, parmesan and come with an amazing side of a aioli vinegar sauce. It's so good we normally get two orders of it! The charcuterie board has plenty to choose from and pairs great with the wines they offer. If you go on Sundays they have half off wine bottles, it's such a great deal. Make sure to check out their burgers and order a cocktail. You will not be disappointed.",

Other reviews said prepare to wait for drinks because they are handcrafted and could take time when the place is crowded. We decided to just go before the dinner rush, around 530. We did not have any wait longer than normal. The service was great and the food was good. It is a Tapas style spot and all the food was very unique. You can tell that the focus here is drinks as the food lacks in the flavor department but makes up in creativity.",

    "text": "Charlotte, you've outdone yourself.  This. This is a cocktail bar. This is a cocktail bar with a small but mighty menu. It's a restaurant, too, sure, but it feels more like a cocktail bar. The menu here though is not to be dismissed. We simply loved their food. We loved their food so much, we found ourselves eating Brussells sprouts -- which we both hate. Or used to? Yes, The Cellar is your cool aunt working in cahoots with your mom because they will make you WANT to eat your Brussells sprouts and they will give you these strong and delicious cocktails as your intoxicating reward.  The ambiance: totally chill, but don't come here in sweatpants please. I mean, you technically could I'm sure, but out of respect for the cocktails....please dress for your cocktails. Perfect for a date, a girls night, 1:2 dinners with your parents, drinks with coworkers, casual drink \"things\" with that guy or girl that you aren't sure if they're on the same page as you???  The cocktail menu is quite extensive and we had a blast being creative there.  TIPS:  1) It's kind of dark....nothing to say about that really, but try not to get too schwasty because I can attest that the walk to the bathroom feels weird when your vision is blurry and the lights are dim. But I guess that's anywhere? 2) Make a reservation. People like to come here. Make a rez. My boyfriend made one and we still had to wait, BUT the hostess reserved two seats for us at the bar so that we could have a few drinks while we waited.  3) Get a flatbread. Get the balsamic Brussels sprouts. Put the balsamic Brussels sprouts on your flatbread. Eat like a pizza. Enjoy your life. 4) Get the burger maybe? My bf heard these great things about the burger and ordered it and loved it. I didn't try it. He didn't offer to share actually...???  So either he was being selfish or just genuinely loved that burger. Or loved the burger so much and selfishly decided NOT to share. *eyeroll* But don't feel too bad for me -- that flatbread was lit. And again please refer to tip #3 -- you wont regret it.  All in all....an excellent meal and wonderful drinks. Will 500% be back next time I'm in town.",

You first walk down stairs and are transported to another world: brick walls, Edison-bulb Light, wait staff in bow ties, dark wood accents and tables. You're greeted by a hostess who is genuine and happy, and sat at a table candle-lit, which, though is very close to a table on either side, feels secluded and private. Then it happens: the best waiter of all-time, DARREN, greets you with a smile. And you feel right at home. When we were seated, we were given an iPad that listed all cocktails and beers, were offered a tour of the net cellar (which the manager gave!!), and offered suggestions by Darren. Tip: do what he says; his suggestions were SO good. Our appetizers: mac n cheese, pork buns, and brussel sprouts. The Mac and cheese was great, but those pork buns and sprouts are on ANOTHER LEVEL. For dinner I had the 14-ounce ribeye and scallops; both were seasoned liberally (YUM!), and cooked perfectly. Dessert: bananas foster French toast w/ house-made ice cream. WE WILL COME BACK! If we are EVER in Charlotte again, I doubt we'll eat anywhere else. What a blast!--what an experience!",

    "text": "Our airport friend suggested that we come here and based on his previous suggestions we had high expectations. We came in for dinner on a Sunday night, this is a very popular spot so we were happy that we got a table as I don't think they take reservations. The vibe is very different down in the celler than the huge sports bar upstairs. The space is a bit narrow with booths and tables alongside the bar.  They also have a nice wine, vintage beer cellar. Our server Bobby was extremely gracious and helpful! He explained that the cocktails here are all made with natural ingredients that are carefully prepared for each specialty drink and that it might take a while. I got the drink with elderflower and ginger, it took the longest but was definitely worth the wait. We ordered the rabbit parpadelle, scallops, bacon and Brussels sprouts and truffle fries. Overall the food was great, portions were not huge but everything was very tasty. I would definitely recommend coming if you're in the area.",

We made the mistake of hanging out upstairs before realizing we were in the wrong Duckworth's restaurant.   Ambience - darker, chill place that feels like a fancy pub. You come down into the cellar and make yourself home.   Service - was very good, much different than the service upstairs.   Apps. -  Brussel sprouts were good - a little less crisp bc of the maple glaze, but added a good flavor Mac/cheese - if you like Gouda, this is the Mac for you - it's pretty strong aftertaste.  Burger - Top 3 I've had anywhere. The Bacon is spicy, bun is soft, the meat (brisket/ground beef mix) was juicy wo being greasy, and the aoili is worth trying. But like a good steak, didn't want to add anything to it.   They have a Beer cellar, simulating a wine cellar. Nice touch.   I'd come back for sure. Great food, great feel, great staff. High five!",

Had to initiate talking with bartender for everything during our meal, why are we tipping?  Mac and cheese was delicious. Steak was good. Burger was burnt and no good. Could only stomach half.

    "text": "After our great initial impression on Tuesday, we were back in last night for dinner this time. The food was very good, adding to my high opinion of this place all around.  We started with the three tacos - you get one pork belly, one braised chicken and one poached octopus. The waitress recommended to start light to dark, starting with the octopus and ending with the pork belly. The octopus was really good, a lighter/white meat. And the pork belly was so flavorful. Those were a good choice.  For my meal, I went with the scallops, which come with currants, cauliflower, turmeric and chorizo. I really liked the chunks of chorizo thrown in, and there was both a cauliflower puree and mini cauliflower. There were 3-4 medium sized scallops and they weren't too buttery or oily, which is usually my complaint. My husband got the cellar burger, which was another win. To differentiate a burger, you've gotta use a good cheese or throw on some great toppings; this was a little of both. The gruyere cheese was amazing, combined with the onion jam and japaleno bacon. Great combination of tastes.  We also split the caramelized brussels. I wasn't as crazy about this small plate because there was too much liquid oozing out. The smoked pancetta was a good addition but these were almost too heavy overall.",

We shared 5 items off the menu - while our 2 favorites were the saffron fettucine with grilled octopus and black grouper, everything was amazing. The ever-popular waffle cones were quite tasty, but a little sweeter than I would have liked.  We began with a charcuterie board that included wild boar sausage and lab cheddar - both were outstanding.    We also each had 2 craft cocktails - the blackberry mezcal mule was deliciously smoky (it was very fun to watch the bartender burning something and capturing the smoke in a pint glass at the bar) and the Cellar Crush was full of fresh, spicy ginger and crushed ice - a sweet and spicy treat!  While the costs prohibit this from being an everyday restaurant, it's certainly one of my favorites for special occasions or splurge nights.  We did make reservations for a Saturday night.  It appears that a couple could probably get a seat at the bar fairly easily until about 6:30 - after that, the room was packed!",

I sat at the bar and started off with a mule that was made perfectly. Super fresh taste. I ordered something else that I didn't love and they promptly replaced it. I ordered everything at once, but since it's tapas, it came out when it was ready. First the char-grilled oysters came out. They were delicious! There was only 5, but they serve you like 8 pieces of bread. Seems a bit wasteful. Next came the duck ragu. It was not what I was expecting at all. I've realized I do not prefer ground duck, you really lose the taste in my opinion. The overall dish was just a bland creamy pile of noodles on my plate. It was ok, but it needed seasoning. Lastly came the roasted Brussels sprouts. And again, they were just ok. I felt like there was too much balsamic and it really overpowered the taste of the sprouts, which I love on their own. And I didn't love the red onion, they just felt like an afterthought. Overall, they get 4 stars for ambiance, drinks, service, and oysters. The ragu and Brussels left a lot to be desired. If I could do 3.5 Stars, I would...",

This is our second time here, and I tried very hard to find something that I didn't care for.  It is rare I give a 5 star, but this place... this place... 5 stars!!    The bartender who served us was from New Jersey and surprisingly very friendly.  We chatted a bit about New York and New Jersey and some of the cool places we have experienced.  We live in New Jersey, so we had lost things to chat about.    She recommended a few items to which we decided they were great suggestions.  When the food arrived, we were floored again by the taste explosion on each of our plates.  The specialty drinks that the bartender made complemented our food very well.  So well, as a matter of fact, we had multiple craft cocktails.  I was amazed each time that as she mixed each beverage, she didn't need a recipe book or someone to remind her what went in each drink.  She was certainly on point!    Aside from the food and beverages, the restaurant is dark and cozy.  It simulates what prohibition days must have felt like when people would sneak around in secret places to enjoy alcoholic beverages.    Our first visit, we had a waiter who was very personable and shared some cool stories with us about his love for men's jewelry.  He said he made his own bracelet at a bead shop in Charlotte to mimic a David Yurman bracelet... and he did a fantastic job!!    Guys, I cannot tell you enough about how awesome this place is.  You will not be disappointed!!",

The Cellar at Duckworth's sounded like a great place, but it was even better than I expected.   My partner and I shared a charcuterie plate, the tuna tartare, and a delicious chocolate torte for dessert--all were delicious and very filling. But, the best part of the evening was the beer. The cellar is a beer lover's dream come True--I've said this about a lot of places, but really! This is the one! As we looked over the ipad for a drink (10+ beers on tap in a small room, and even more in bottles) our bartender offered us a tour of their beer cellar, a 55 degree room cooled perfectly to meet the needs of 200+ bottles, many of them rare and vintage.  Charles, their \"beer collector\", was knowledgeable and excited about our questions, and helped us pick out several bottles that we hadn't tried before.   The cocktails looked fantastic, and I can't wait to go back and try more things (but only during the week...we tried going again on Saturday and the wait was 2 hours).",

    "text": "What a nice addition to the uptown dining scene, and quite unexpected just below a Sports bar literally glowing from the TVs mounted everywhere!  Take a walk down the stairs at the front door and see what I mean.  Talk about a contrast: The ambiance from the moment the hostess slides open the wooden door is dark and moody, highlighted with tiny candle lights. It definitely has the feel of a hidden Speakeasy the requires a secret knock to find.  Bare brick walls, exposed metal and lots of dark wood set the scene before a large and serious cocktail bar for specialty drinks.  And, yep, craft cocktails are their jam here.  Handcrafted everything, blow torches and glasses filled with smoke, fresh herbs for muddling, square blocks of ice.... you get the scene.  But that's not all, they also have a dozen or so beer taps for your \"harder to find\" craft beer scene.  Highland's Cold Mountain Winter Ale, for example, both from the keg AND from the cask.  They also have a beer vault for the serious collector you can request to peruse as well.  In short, this is not a place to skip the drinks, this is half of what the space is all about.  The other half of this concept is about the food, where the trend of small plates to be shared continues throughout the majority of the menu, though a small entree selection is available as well.  Meats and cheeses, salads, and a number of inventive hot and cold tapas type foods dominate here.  Just be aware- food comes out as it is ready, so pacing can be hot or miss here if you are trying to work thru a number of different plates.  Highlights include the truffle mac and cheese and house made waffle cones served in a 3-pack with a range of different fillings- from cole poke style tuna to a sweet & spicy Sriracha chicken.  Though I haven't tried them, they also have a s'mores dessert and a chocolate torte that would make this place a fine stop just for an after-dinner or show drink and sweet bite.    Great for a date, or even an after-work gathering of friends or co-workers.  Just be aware no reservations after 7- it's first come first-served.",

I will say that you really feel like you're in another world when you first enter the cellar through the sliding door. The wife even exclaimed \"it's like we're not even in Charlotte anymore\". Promptly we were seated and our server was quick to introduce himself and explain the menu and the concept. There was a lot of info to consider, and we perused the extensive beer (both draft and bottle), cocktails, wine and spirit lists. There were definitely some rare beers on draft, but the real rare ones are on the bottle list. Prices for the bottles are overall reasonable, while others are definitely wallet busters. The drafts that we chose were alright but not spectacular. My favorite beer of the night was a peach sour beer from Allagash. It was from a bottle and definitely pricey. The wife switched to a cocktail on the second round, and if her Vieux Carre is any indication of the quality of the cocktails at the cellar, we will become regulars here. I will say that the bar crew seemed to know what they were doing.   On to the food, the smoked salmon flatbread was split between us and it was delicious. The flavors of the salmon were perfectly paired with the basil mascarpone spread and fried capers. The flatbread itself is very thin and crispy, not doughy like other flatbreads. The wife got the black grouper entree as her main and the burger sounded too good to pass up for me. First of all, the portion on both entrees and the flatbread were very generous, especially for the price point. My burger was cooked medium or maybe a little under which was perfect. The result was a juicy tasty burger that I will order again and again, along with recommending to others. The wife's grouper was cooked perfectly and the accompanying candied carrots, pesto rice and grilled artichokes complimented well the fish. No room really for a real dessert, but room for a liquid one in the form of a Greenman brewing chocolate stout to spilt between the 2 of us.  The service was on point, friendly, informative and engaging in conversation with us about beer, food, etc. I will say that the only drawback was the wooden vintage like high top chairs which are a little clunky and definitely not comfortable for the majority of people. Maybe I felt it more sitting on that chair since others in the booth or the low top tables had really cushy leather chairs. The haves versus the have nots I guess? We shall return often, but may skip if only high tops tables with vintage chairs are available. I would be worth the wait for me to get a cushy leather chair on my next visit.",

We loved the guacamole and asked if we could get a side and chips. We were told that \"I'm sorry. The chef only accounts for the exact number of portions that are needed for  the entrees \"    Waited 30 min for our \"craft cocktails\".  Tried to move our party  to the bar.  Manager type said they saved bar stools for walk-ins. Really!!!??  We are at a table that we are not happy with. And we can't move to the bar?  Beyond comprehension!!   Move on. Don't even think about this place. Their customer service.  SUCKS  There are many other good places to go...food as good... service better.",

I went here for a date night and the food was INCREDIBLE. It absolutely blew me away and was honestly one of the best meals I've ever had in my life. We shared three starters: hand cut truffle fries, truffle mac n' cheese, and the home made waffle cones. Clearly, I love anything truffle flavored but the truffle mac n' cheese was to die for. The waffle cones also had such unique combinations of flavors and I had never had anything like it before (or again). SO SO GOOD. The starters are the real show stopper here. For dinner, I had the filet which was also delicious. In addition to the food, this place is well known for their drinks. They take pride in their cocktails and they live up to the hype. I would reccomend the sazerac.",

I say \"near traditional\" since they don't use cubes but instead use a slow drip of cold water over an ice earthy brown sugar. A nice glass of Brothers Vilgalys on artisan ice is a great way to wind down from a long week. Many other excellent Rye selections such as Templeton's. The bartenders such as Amanda are proud of their craft and will be happy to explain more on the drinks. The GM Charles is a great guy who is quite knowledgeable himself of all the spirits in stock and makes neat recommendations. The cellar has a nice rustic decor with the whole Tesla era long filament bulb decor combined with an old wine cellar wood and bridge metal stools. Definitely looking forward to future visits at this place!",

Nothing about them were good at all & if it wasn't for my friend eating them because she didn't want to take them back I would have, because they were a complete waste of $16 for 5 oysters at that. But I digress because other then that I had a wonderful evening here. The atmosphere here is very intimate and is perfect for a date night or even a nice ladies night. It's dimly lit and the music is low.  I started with the East Village as my drink of choice, if you're a bourbon drinker I would highly suggest it. For food we ordered the caramelized brussels that were cooked to perfection, the ground duck flatbread that was delicious, and the not too pleased with chargrilled oysters. The service was great, the bartender was friendly, offered suggestions, and was very attentive. I will definitely be back to get the Brussels again & to try some other menu items.",

    "text": "Outstanding service, great wine selection, 400 wide beer selection, handmade craft cocktails, extensive taps selection -- what more could you ask for?   The Cellar is small so they only take reservations until 6, then first come first serve starts at 7pm. If you play your cards right it's pretty easy to walk in. The ambiance is really romantic, with exposed brick and dim lighting. There's not a bad seat in the house.   The service is outstanding -- the waiters are very helpful and knowledgeable. You never feel rushed out and are encouraged to relax and have a good time! The staff and kitchen are also very accommodating (have an allergy or food intolerance? They're really good at taking care of you and making sure you're experience is great despite the limits).   Pro tip: ask for a tour of the Cellar while you wait on your drinks or food. Since it's tapas style and made fresh to order, everything comes out a different times.   I recommend the duck flatbread, cones, and truffle Mac n cheese!",

    "text": "What a great experience and some excellent food. The first time for us and personally my first real Tapas experience . The candied jalapeno bacon was good and had a small kick. The pork cheek buns were excellent!!  The cheese plate was a tad disappointing as it was skimpy on cheese choices. Our dinners were surprisingly larger than expected and all very good. Two of us had the black grouper, one had scallops, and one had duck ragout.  We added the Brussel sprouts which were just fabulous. The desert is what kept this from 5 stars for me. Nutella cheesecake was good but more a mousse than cheesecake and unfortunately the S'mores desert was not done right. You can't serve an uncooked marshmallow in a s'mores and made it very difficult to eat.  I do recommend giving this place a whirl, just keep the s'mores for the backyard!!!",

    "text": "I first visited The Cellar at Duckworth's quite a while ago as I was frantically searching for a place to seat 18 people... the DAY OF.  Surprisingly and thankfully, I was able secure us a large table (stool seating in the middle) for a team member's farewell party.  Since then, I've frequented this joint several times, usually to meet friends/colleagues for after-dinner drinks.  The Cellar is located underneath Duckworth's Sports Bar and sports a much different vibe than it's counterpart upstairs.  It's a cozy, speak-easyish vibe with good dim lighting and old-school decor.  It's a separate restaurant from upstairs, in that it opens only at 5pm and don't forget your credit cards here because they won't be able to get it for you before they open upstairs (I learned this the hard way).  Service is usually pretty good, except for when they had 1 server for an entire table of 18 the first time around.  Their many creative drinks as well as basic liquors can be ordered on their fancy iPad menu.  With a speakeasy vibe and fancy iPad menu also comes a speakeasy price, similar to that in NYC.  Drinks here are not the cheapest on the block, but you definitely get what you pay for.  I only got food the first time around and from what I remember, everyone was pretty happy with my choice of restaurant (thanks Yelp!) and we all left with happy stomachs.  I personally enjoyed the truffle fries and the tuna tartare, which came with a bit of chili oil for a kick, guacamole, and wonton chips.  Also good were the scallops.  You can't really go wrong with any of the food here and it's definitely way better than your average bar food.  I recommended this place to an old college friend who was in Charlotte for a while and got kudos for it - he called it he best restaurant in Charlotte!  Will continue to frequent this spot until I finally get to leave my travel assignment in Charlotte :)",

If you take a sip of water they refill it almost immediately.  Great bar list. Handcrafted cocktails galore.  Food was great.   Cons: The menu is a bit small and would like to see some more choices. The plates are also small.   Takeaway: I would definitely go back! I would not recommend this place to kids. The dress is more business casual.   Would I go back? Yes!",

    "text": "My husband and I have been wanting to check this place out since moving here. We decided to go for his birthday along with my friend visiting from out of town.   We had reservations and were immediately seated at a high top. It has a nice vibe but it's a tight space and a bit loud for my personal liking.   We ordered several small plates: charcuterie, Brussels with balsamic and pancetta, truffle mac and cheese, steamed bun pork sliders, and a steak to share. Everything was delicious! It was nice to have foods we like but with a twist...something different. My only complaint was that everything came out so close together not leaving much room at the table and somewhat rushed our experience.   Our server Darren was awesome and made the night! Being our first time, he took the time to tell us about the restaurant, drinks and food. He even brought out a surprise dessert and candle to celebrate my husband's birthday. It was a great way to end the evening!   Am I glad we went? Absolutely! Would we go back? Maybe...for a special occasion. Cocktails average $13-$15 and some of the small plates average about the same which quickly adds up. If you haven't been, it's worth checking out!",

When you arrive, they give you an ipad to browse through their drink menu and you can mark things you are interested in. It was hard to pick just one but the waitress was very helpful in describing the drinks and making recommendations. I wound up ordering the French Buck to drink which included gin, prosecco, and a nice citrusy flavor. Their beer list is also killer!  For food, we ordered tapas for the table: the lamb, the truffle mac and cheese, the tuna tartare (a favorite we get every time), and the ground duck flatbread. Everything was amazing! The lamb in particular was really good... even our Irish friend who is super picky about his lamb said \"it's not bad for lamb in America\" and his fiance said he's never said that before, so I consider that a major win.  Since we were celebrating, our waitress surprised us with a smore's dessert on the house! This included a dragon's milk ganache, marshmallow puff, and graham cracker. SOOO yummy.   This is an amazing experience every time we go and is worth every penny.",

The drink menu looked amazing (and pricey, but you get what you pay for).  I highly recommend the brussels and duck flatbreads to share, as well as a Cellar tour.  Don't come in a rush please.  This is more of an experience than filling your belly.  The oysters got rave reviews, but since I live where oysters practically beat down the door to be eaten they were not on my to-do list.  It is a cool vibe and if I were a local it would be part of my regular scene (and possibly a 5-star).  Never noticed any desserts on the menu, but it could be because who needs desserts when a bite of sprouts is better than the best bananas foster?",

Our server Patrick was astounding, exactly what you'd expect and want for great service. Nice recommendations, stopped by time to time to ask how the food was going, and did something no server has done before --- shook our hand at the end and said it was nice to meet us -- something that was unique and stayed with me.  Dinner highlights: The charbroiled oysters are for any oyster, garlic, butter loving person, (I'm thinking this is a new tradition too). As may be the tuna tartrare, chunky fresh tuna, not overdressed which is a huge pet peeve of mine, and good guac to go with it. The grouper with pesto rice was a little bit heavy on the salt, but otherwise very tasty. The fried peppers were a little underwhelming for me, didn't remind me of Spain as much as I wanted it to -- but that's a personal preference, my boyfriend loved them!  Also, if you like to imbibe and with the name \" Cellar's\" you should know they have tons for you. I want to say it was over 300 bottled beers, a few drafts, and about 10 or so crafted cocktails -- my smokey margarita was great.  Highly recommended!",

Our table had just a few small plates - jalapeno bacon and truffle mac were both excellent. We also had the beet salad. It was very good, but not the best beet salad I've had. For the money, I would order a different dish. For dinner, I had the black grouper and it was fantastic. Our waiter was helpful with suggestions on cocktails, beer, small and large plates. You could tell he knew the entire menu very well. The Cellar is pretty expensive, but a good place for a very special birthday dinner. It's about $100 for two people.",

From the moment I walked in something wasn't  right. The main dining area seemed half full, extra loud and people/tables were jammed up by the only entrance to the dining room.   When we were seated, a server was setting up the table behind ours. I said excuse me to the server that was standing over my seat (after the rest of my party was seated) and he turned around and sneered at me. That set the tone for the rest of the evening.     When I finally sat down we all didn't have menus and only one iPad with the drink menu. The server proceeded to rush us to order drinks. No, is this your first time here or can I explain the drink menu to you. I could go on ... To sum it up, the service was terrible and not knowledgeable enough to explain the concept to us, as two of the folks dining with us we're first timers. She didn't have any craft beer knowledge as a brown ale does not equal a Stella and we were continuously rushed thorough the meal.   The food was great as usual. However, the service far overshadowed the great food. For that reason I have to give the experience only 3 stars.  12/25 Thanks for the reply Duckworth's responding to you directly as suggested and received no response. Once again great service. Minus one star for the additional great service.",

I was a little sticker shocked by the beer (over $10 for a 12 oz pour!) - and that they're served in a wine glass. BUT they do have more economical beer by the can options. I was happy with my NoDa Cavu ($5.50 seems to be a bargain by comparison).  I was impressed by the menu. I went with the Tacos Trio ($12) - they had me at pork belly and octopus! The braised chicken was my least favorite, but the pork belly & octopus tacos were both excellent.    Service was good - the waiter was attentive and showed a sense of humor and personality.

    "text": "After a long and arduous trek to Charlotte involving multiple delayed flights and other crap, I was absolutely starving. Most of the restaurants I looked into closed at 10pm on Thursday, so I was kind of screwed until I magically stumbled upon this place.   It literally is in a basement, there is a sports bar upstairs, so it was kind of odd at first. This place has a very intimate charm to it, there is a speakeasy feel to it. There is a rather large bar along the side with low lighting and a bunch of high tops. Our waitress, Andrea, was absolutely wonderful. She was bubbly and pleasant, offering good suggestions on the menu and wine.   The wine list was actually on an iPad which I found cool since it allowed me to see the bottle of what I would be ordering. We ended up getting a bottle of French Bourgogne (Chardonnay essentially) and it was wonderful. Food wise we ordered some grouper, a tuna tartare and a truffle Mac and cheese to split between the two of us, and the food came out all as it was finished rather than as a table order. I was glad to see this as I was starving. More places seem to be doing this to avoid cold food.   Everything was completely and utterly decadent, and the atmosphere and service were top-notch. I wasn't expecting a place called \"the cellar\" to have such awesome food but this is really a well kept secret it seems (although the time we went was also odd). I'm not a local to Charlotte, but if I get back into town for whatever reason, I'll keep this place on my list. Very impressed.",

    "text": "My husband and I stumbled upon The Cellar this past Saturday. Since then, I have been going back and forth about writing a review. I mean, I am not normally a selfish person. BUT, I don't know if I am ready just yet to share this place with the world! My love for all ya'll won out!  How to get to The Cellar?--Walk into Duckworths and go immediately downstairs. From there, you will be greeted by a hostess at a stand. She will ask if you are here for The Cellar. Once you say yes, she will slide back (yes, slide) the huge doors to this cool spot!   The Cellar is modeled after a 1920s Speak Easy. Hence the slightly hidden spot. It is dimly lit with exposed brick everywhere. Fairly small space to keep that speak easy feel intact. All the waiters/bartenders wear suspenders and bowties. It just feels so genuine.   We grabbed two spots at the bar and were immediately handled a Tablet with all the drinks. Both my husband and I got a cocktail from the menu because all of them looked fantastic. After speaking with the bartender all night, I think the cocktails here are where it's at. Strong mixologoy game going on at The Cellar!  I ordered the Blind Peach and my husband ordered The East Village (basically a spin on The Manhattan). Our bartender took alot of time and care in crafting these two drinks, including topping mine with a hand picked flower petal. Both drinks were absolutely amazing! He told us that for the cherry in my husbands East Village, that he hand pits all the cherries with this pitter he made out of a fork. Then the cherries are soaked in some spices and liquor (there was a bunch of stuff he listed). I wish I remembered our bartenders name, as we was incredible! I got the impression that he was the head bartender.....awesome stuff coming from behind the bar!  Additionally, we ordered the Truffle Mac and Cheese. Great portion and it was purely delish! Super creamy with that strong truffle taste. There was also pancetta (or it may have been bacon) in it as well. Can't speak to anything else on the menu. But, based on the mac n cheese alone, the kitchen is pumping out equal caliber to the bar!  I can't wait to go back here and check out more of what The Cellar has to offer!",

The decor and vibe is True to the speakeasy origin. I first visited on a quiet night and Charles invited us to check out the beer cellar. He went on to describe the exhaustive variety of rare brews. They even have personal lockers for $250 per year - a few were still left.   As with Duckworth's upstairs, the drink menu is on an iPad, making it easy to search and filter results. The cocktails are great and the bartenders are top notch. Cocktails are in the $14 range and the beer varies widely, up to $60.   According to the staff, there is plenty of fascinating history to the location. Apparently some big names have played there, including Prince.",

    "text": "We decided to let the excitement die down a little before we checked out The Cellar, but the fella was seriously stoked to finally get there. He's a beer nerd who has traveled thousands of miles for rare beers and has a special love for Duckworth's.  The atmosphere is so cool and laid-back, definitely a dark, speakeasy vibe. Our waiter was really nice and patient - we went with another couple and hung out for about 3 hours! However, we spent those hours doing A LOT of eating and drinking.  We started with the meat and cheese board - 3 meats and 2 cheeses. Everything was good, but the \"wild boar\" tasted a lot like pepperoni. From there, we moved onto the waffle cones. They were an interesting gimmick, but I don't think the sweetness of the cone added anything to the tuna or shrimp cones; however, it did nicely balance out the heat of the sriracha chicken. After that, we tried the brussels sprouts (delicious) and truffle mac & cheese (decadent). For our main, we split two burgers, which were fine, but nothing to write home about. For dessert, we got the S'more and the chocolate torte... when in doubt, go for the S'more all day.  Onto the beer! So, my review is a VERY hopeful 4 stars because their beer selection was just okay. There were one or two semi-rare options, but for the most part, there just wasn't anything crazy unique on tap or in the cellar. However, I'm sure they're building their inventory, so I'll stick with being hopeful. Our waiter also wasn't very smart about beer. When one of us said, \"I like Belgian strong, dark ales - what do you have like that?,\" our waiter had to scan the iPad list and didn't seem to have a great handle on what they had or what would fit that bill.  We'll definitely be back, but we'll hope it just keeps getting better.",

They were all so delicious that none of us could pick a favorite! The malt vinegar aioli with the fries, the balsamic reduction on the Brussels, and the smokiness of the Gouda in the mac were flavors that simply can't be beat.   No complaints here. Well worth the time and money.",

I'm relatively new to the craft beer world, I hid out for a long time in the cider section. (Thank you, thank you, I'm happy to be here...) the Cellar has an INCREDIBLE selection of beers. Charles, the general manager, is super friendly, passionate about craft beer and happy to point you in the right direction. He even gave us a little tour of the Cellar - it wasn't open yet when I was here for the soft opening. I was SO nerdy excited to go into the cellar, where beautiful, unique craft beers live and are kept at 55 degrees, ready to be enjoyed. The whole layout of this dining experience is beautiful. From the exposed brick to the wood and metal accents. I love the feel of this place.  My date and I started our meal with the 2013 Sierra Nevada Narwhal. We ordered the truffle mac and cheese right off the bat while we looked at the other beers and tried to decide on food - so freaking delicious. Towards the end of our meal, Charles told us about a Limited Edition Allagash beer that Duckworth's was only allotted 30 bottles, 6 for each location. They had all 30 shipped to the Cellar. It's called Farm to Face, it's a peach sour - and it's AMAZING. I highly suggest you hunt this beer down before it's gone! Huge props to Charles for recommending it. I also highly suggest chatting up Charles, he's an awesome guy.   Cheers to the Cellar! I'll be seeing you soon!",

    "text": "I just landed a new job (thank you, thank you!) and the lady wanted to take me out for a nice celebratory dinner. I'll preface this review with a tl;dr at the beginning: It's gonna be hard for me to top this place as far as dining experiences go.  You walk down the staircase, and suddenly, everything changes from sports bar to swanky '20s speakeasy, complete with bowtie'd hosts and hostesses, jazz noir music (provided by their very own pandora station), dim lights, and mason jar lined tables with dark tones. This is legit, man. The only thing that The Cellar shares in common with upstairs? The owner and the use of Ipads for drinks. Even the general manager is separate.  The Drinks: The Cellar prides themselves on providing rare beers, and they sure do excel. In fact, I hadn't heard of a single one of them on their menu. They have a good variety of aged stouts, porters, belgians, farmhouse ales, even some wine type drinks. We didn't even delve into the cocktail menu. The staff is super knowledgeable about the beers as well, citing their flavor profiles and prominent flavors. FYI, since these are so rare, you're only gonna get 5 to 9 ounce pours on most. Sip and enjoy, this is NOT the place to be slamming nattys with the guys.  The food: Food is served tapas style with dishes coming right to your table when they're done cooking. I could honestly write paragraphs describing the handcrafted details and complexity and deliciousness of this food, but I'll keep it short:  3 Cheese/Meat Plate ($15) : We chose the Sopraseta, Aged Gouda, and a cheese I had never heard of called a Challerhocker (literally translates to 'sitting in the cellar'), all paired with different dips and preserves, as well as spent-grain bread from Birdsong. Amazing.  Tuna Tartare ($12) : Beautifully prepared with crispy noodles, an awesome guac, and crispy wontons to eat it all up with. Incredibly well seasoned and tasty.  Truffle Mac N Cheese ($12) : Both the Lady and I tasted it and said \"...wut.\" It's not food, it's just bliss. Heavy on the truffle, but little bits of prosciutto add the needed saltiness throughout the dish. Perfectly cooked and fantastically flavored.  Scallops ($19) : Jesus. How can they make food that good? Paired with a cauliflower puree and a salsa of roasted corn and currants for sweetness, this dish was out of this world!   Service:  Our server, Gabby, was absolutely delightful. She stayed with us to talk us through the intricacies of each dish, and was very attentive the entire night. Made us feel very welcome. Thanks, Gabby.  The manager came up and introduced himself to make sure everything was going alright. At the end of the night, I spotted the actual beer bottle cellar and he took the Lady and I in and explained their long term plans, interesting things about the building (it very well may have been a real speakeasy!), and talked to us about the chef. He took about 15 minutes out of his time there to show us around, it was really cool!  Overall, I can't recommend this place enough. Go and try it for yourself, I know we'll be back for the smores and cocktails which we were just too stuffed to fit in our stomachs!",

For those complaining about wait time, it's a CRAFT cocktail which means it has multiple ingredients and a process.   Our waiter Darren was absolutely fantastic. Probably one of the best waiters I've ever had and really made our experience memorable. He had great recommendations and was very down to earth.   The food out of a 5 point scale was a 4. We tried a bunch of small plates but weren't overly \"wow'd\" except for a few dishes. Incredible charcuterie, brussels, tuna tartare and truffle fries. Could so without the oysters (too much garlic) and the flatbread (too little meat and very little flavor).   The service was incredible and really made our experience. I'd be back to see Darren, grab some bites and a cocktail for sure.",

Was a bit obnoxious to me when I had to remind him that my friend wanted to place an order for an entree after the 4 small plate dishes... (Said, \"I'll get it after I get this order in\") - we sat right next to service bar where he was typing something in... he passed our table numerous times and never picked up the empty plates from the tapas meals... we had to remind him twice about drinks we ordered that didn't come or came at different times.... My friend asked him \"how's that Diet Coke coming\" and he said, \"Great, \"I love Diet Coke\" - which wasn't the response we would have expected... (My friend had to say, \"Is it coming?\". We'd give all the food 5 stars for flavor - really outstanding, service at a 1 star, and value at 2 to 3 stars (5 tapas dishes, steak, 2 drinks, for 3 people = $190 w/ tax...",

We ordered 2 draft beers, the bar tendered poured them and served them to us with 1/3 of the glass having a foam head. I made a jokingly comment to the bartender with no acknowledgement. We had to wait almost 10 minutes for it to go down before we could get liquid to drink. I ordered a second beer with a different bartender and the same thing happened. This time I asked them to remove some of the head and please re-pour. We left there thinking this may be a tactic to save money!!!!  The manager or owner certainly needs to train the bartenders how to pour a draft beer! The menu is just ok and very limited. We love the atmosphere and I get the dark speakeasy setting but they somehow need to provide lighting or mini flashlights to read the small print menu. Perhaps small table lights to assist so you don't need to pull out our phones. Needless to say we did not return after the show!!!!",

    "text": "Walking up to the restaurant my husband just kept saying this is the place we needed a reservation for, it's a sports bar. And the name is Duckworth's Tap and Grill. Mind you it looked like an awesome sports bar. It was large, two levels, and full of TVs. But for our anniversary it didn't seem right. When we walked in we immediately saw the sign for the Cellar going down stairs.  We walked in and told them about our reservation. They took us right in, not waiting. I have made reservations at places that make you wait a little. You got the True feel of prohibition. The double swinging doors, the low lighting, and suspender clad uniforms of the staff.  They had two menus, as usual, one for food and one for drinks. The food menu was paper in a leather holder. The drink menu was on an iPad.  I loved the menu, I would love to come back with a group and order everything!  We settled on the truffle fries, mushroom medley, carmelized brussels, the shishito peppers, and for our large plate we chose the scallops. Ummmm those scallops, they came with cauliflower, corn, currants and, drumroll please, chorizo!  When I woke up this morning, I thought I sure would love to eat that for breakfast. That is how good it was! My mouth is watering, so I need to move on. The mushrooms were in a cream sauce and it was delicious. The truffle fries were as good as any I have ever had, for me the test is what are they like when they are cold because I eat slow. You don't always want to rush and eat your fries first for fear that they will start to taste bad. These fries passed the test with flying colors. I am not a huge fan of brussels sprouts, but I will always try them. Their brussels did not disappoint, they were delicious.   For drinks I went with the cellar margarita and my husband had the spicy smoked peach margarita. My drink was perfect. I have kind of spoiled myself a bit when it comes to drinks. When making them at home I make them from scratch, no mixes for me. So now when I am at decent restaurant I always ask if they use a mix. If the answer is yes I pass, usually. I did not need to ask in this case, the menu was very detailed and the waiter did an excellent job of explaining how cocktails are prepared, i.e. fresh squeezed juice, no flavored liquor (hallelujah), etc. My husband's peach margarita had smoked salt and jalapenos. It was very yummy, he had two. Another great litmus test, good liquor does not overwhelm you. I could not taste the tequila, but I felt then affects very quickly. My husband mentioned it the next day. I would like to try the smoked whiskey sour next time.",

Call me old fashioned but I find that off putting. Give me a paper menu any day.   The drinks were great but took a while. Understand, they're craft. The service was wonderful and everyone was friendly. But for those who have said this is the best meal ever, I have to disagree. I had to send a side back due to a long hair in it. The food was good, not great. And it was VERY loud in there to the point where my husband and I couldn't really chat. An average experience, but not one to hustle to. The prices are high, if I were you I'd try elsewhere.",

Craft cocktails are always executed thoughtfully. I had the margarita and it was perfect. Not too sweet and not too boozy.   For starters we always get the candied jalapeno bacon. This is a must. It comes with a spicy mustard that has quite the kick. It pairs perfectly with the sweetness of the bacon.  So good.  We also got an order of the mushrooms. They're amazing- earthy and savory with a garlic cream to balance them out. I wanted to order more after we finished them.   The steam buns and grouper were or main course I suppose you can say. The steam buns have these delicate soft buns stuffed with all the appropriate bahn mi ingredients- the plate is dressed with a sriracha sauce that'll have you mopping your steam bun in because it's tasty.   The black grouper is also a mighty delicious dish. Perfectly cooked and sitting in some flavorful pesto rice and pair with some earthy artichoke hearts and sweet carrots.   We finished off the meal with the Nutella \"cheesecake\" - which is more a mousse sitting atop a graham cracker crust hugged by some whipped cream.   You have to be prepared to share so you can try a little bit of everything. Def make a reservation, it's a pretty small place but totally worth a wait.",

Seriously, seafood dishes in the $19 to $25 range are unheard of for the quality of preparation. The black grouper is fantastic! I would expect the dish in any other restaurant to cost at least an additional $10. Same with the sea scallops. The Mac N Cheese was rich, delicious and enough for four of us to share.  One of our steak loving companions said the filet mignon was seriously the best he ever had. Drink prices, like most places lately , do run around the $14 mark. Service was excellent! One of our friends wasn't impressed by the shrimp and grits. She said the chorizo was like a heavy hamburger patty on top of the shrimp and overwhelming. That was the only negative.   If you make a reservation, allow plenty of time to find parking. If you are paying attention, right across the street is a parking garage that is free after 5:00 p.m. Traffic is heavy so be prepared. Look for the giant Ferris wheel.",

I literally could not stop thinking about this place, had to go a 2nd time in the same week!  When I walked in I was sure I went to the wrong place or wrong address. But the restaurant is downstairs. It feels significantly different down there being a speakeasy, think Prohibition era meets modern cigar lounge feel. I can see this place being a really nice date spot or great for catching up with friends.   The menu had many options But some of my favorites were the duck flatbread, tuna tartar and the scallops entree. I was most impressed with the drink options. I had the smoked butter pecan old fashioned, it was amazing! I also had the bourbon barrel aged quadrupel ale from Three Philosophers and I was dreaming about it the next day, if you like dark beers with bourbon kick this is for you.  So onto the service. If the beer or food options mentioned above don't peak your interest I promise you that if you give your server any inkling that you're looking for some guidance they will be more than happy to help you. We actually had the opportunity to go into the Cellar and what I mean by that is their beer fridge that looks not unlike a humidor. Fun fact: that's where their name The Cellar comes from. It houses many beers they have on site.  It's not every time that you go to a restaurant and feel like you got the city experience. When in Charlotte visit The Cellar.",

Walking through an American Pub type restaurant and down some stairs into its basement feels like you might stumble across an underground poker game. It makes for an interesting vibe; arguably something that is largely missing from Uptown. The decor and setting make for a pretty cool experience. Something about it feels very private and intimate even though it will most likely be packed.  If you are labeling yourself as a speakeasy-style restaurant you better have outstanding cocktails and The Cellar holds up pretty well in this area. The beer selection is pretty good as well. Food-wise they could certainly do some things better. The grilled octopus was not done very well and tasted a bit off. The waffle cone trio while an interesting idea, failed to really impress. The duck ragu felt like it was just trying a little too hard. The Brussels sprouts are excellent, but those are hard to mess up.   After a handful of visits here, I've realized the service can be hit or miss. Some wait staff are fully capable of providing excellent service even though they are clearly slammed, while others only check in every 15-30 minutes. I wish it were more consistent. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND making a reservation well in advance. This isn't the place to roll up to at 7PM asking for a table.  All in all, this is a very interesting spot that I would recommend checking out, but after a 3 year span, other restaurants on the surface have surpassed it...3.5/5.",

    "text": "Such a disappointment!  I had high hopes from the reviews here on Yelp that this would be a place I would come back to when I am in Charlotte.    I arrived, and was quite happy with what I saw.  It seemed like a place that wanted to be something more than ordinary.  As a single diner, I sat at the bar.  I looked around and saw lots of pretty people eating pretty food.  But looks aren't everything.  The bartender took a few minutes to acknowledge me, which should have tipped me off.  He took my order and brought my drink.  Good basic service, but nothing more.  I ordered the red snapper in a curry sauce, and was hoping for a rich mix of flavors to compliment my favorite fish.  What arrived was a slightly overcooked filet in a puddle of very attractive red sauce that had almost no flavor at all. Not awful, but certainly nothing to write home about.  I felt I unsatisfied after the fish, and decided to have another drink and dessert.  (Sugar and Alcohol make any meal better, right?). It took a few minutes to get the bartender's attention to get a dessert menu, and after waiting 15 minutes to put my dessert order in, I gave up and just got the check!   A competent meal and poor service.",

    "text": "On a weekender in Charlotte, we made reservations here.   It was a small speakeasy themed restaurant, a theme popular in the area, you have to walk into another restaurant (Duckworth's) and down the stairs to get to it.   We ordered a charcuterie board, the waffle cones, and a ribeye to share. I usually don't go for red meats, but our waiter raved about how their head chef was making sure each piece came out perfect of their 1800 degree oven. I have to admit the waiter really sold me on it.   Our food came out all at once, which was so strange to me. Although we didn't specify when we ordered, I would've expected it to be staged.  The charcuterie board was good, not the best, but it's really hard to mess this one up. The waffle cones were supposed to be: 1, 2, 3, but they all had very similar flavors - the fillings were all too sweet. Finally, the ribeye was definitely rare, average, and not worth the money.",

I was in the mood to try something new and decided on Cellar, best decision I've made all week!   I went with a friend and we decided on a couple of tapas to share. We landed on the tacos, waffle cones and risotto. Everything was amazing! I would suggest that there be more servings with the tacos. Since it's a tapas place, people are usually sharing. Also, the waffle cones (filled with octopus, shrimp and chicken - 3 diff kinds) were incredibly difficult to share. We ended up complete destroying the waffles and didn't think the waffle cones complemented the flavors of the entire dish. I do highly recommend the risotto. It was probably the best risotto I've ever tasted!   As far as drinks, I decide on their twist of a Mai tai that had hints coconut essence - absolutely amazing! My friend also loved their drink, and the perfect setting for drinks!  Despite a couple of technical items, I truly enjoyed The Cellar and can't wait to come back!",

After the ghost tour my husband ordered Where There's Smoke & I asked the bartender (Cameron) to make something like a dessert cocktail. Both out drinks were amazing again!

The cellar smash, i believe, was refreshing and tasty...much more than just juice and liquor.  The smoke margarihta will be my next beverage adventure upon my return. The brussel sprouts are a perfect balance of char and bacon.  The steak is absolutely delicious, cooked to temp, & served by hot waiters. Stay for dessert, the smores were a great end to the meal but best to share after a large steak. Reservations are encouraged!",

I ordered the shrimp and cheddar grits - it was TO DIE FOR. I was so nervous to try grits, but this dish was so tasty, I'm craving more!!! I added three extra shrimp to the dish because I love shrimp, and the chorizo \"sauce\" added to the grits was amazing.

Not only do they have the best of all the locals they have a huge list of other domestic breweries including Wicked Weed.  I have had great luck with the servers as well having decent knowledge of what to try.  Pricing is also a bit high, but their specials are usually decent.    On football Sundays they have $4 mimosas and bloody marys.  They also usually have a $3.50 beer special.  There are tons of Tvs and a good crowd as well.  The bad is the management isn't very accommodating on seating - your whole party needs to be there before you can sit .  Yea that protects them from no shows but it makes it hard for people to plan ahead.  They also don't give any leeway to repeat customers - so loyalty seems to mean little.  And don't ask for tvs to be changed downstairs - not going to happen.",

They have so many to choose from. Our favorite tapas include the brussel sprouts, Mac and cheese, duck and fig flatbread, and truffle fries. The only thing we weren't a fan of is the candied bacon. It was a little too spicy for our preference but if you like jalapenos and bacon you would like it! Highly recommend for date night or special occasion. It's delicious.",

They also had a large beer cellar and some of the bottles were available to take home! The waiter and bartender were not only knowledgeable about beer but clearly paying attention to my preferences and making very appropriate recommendations. We also really enjoyed their s'mores dessert!",

Darren is a spectacular server, gave us a tour of the beer \"vault\", and took excellent care of us. The drinks are amazing, and every bite of food was perfection.  Our orders for the night (abbrev. names): oysters, truffle fries, scallops, duck ragu, tomahawk ribeye, s'more, and french toast.  Darren warned us that drinks would take a bit longer due to complexity, but were always completely worth the wait. Prices were very reasonable for high quality of both food and drinks.",

    "text": "The Cellar definitely offers something that you don't find in Charlotte.  A restaurant/bar located down a flight of stairs of the uptown Duckworth's location.  As others have mentioned it is dark with a speak easy feel.  They offer craft cocktails, beer and wine with a full menu of appetizers, shared items, entrees and desserts.  The craft cocktails are all unique and allow anyone sitting at the bar to get a view of the skills of some of the mixologists, for example the burning of orange peels to give orange smoke flavor to one of their signature drinks.  I have been to The Cellar three times now and have enjoyed every visit.  The Manager is on point, walking the floor, checking in on customers and opening up about the story of The Cellar, the drinks, etc. As for the food, OMG. I can say the tuna tartare, one of the cold appetizers, is probably some of the best tartare I have ever had. And, the oysters, char grilled, were spot on. The first time I had them they were so hot, straight off the grill, with melted butter and bread served to sop of the butter and oyster juice...amazing.  This most recent visit I went to celebrate and early birthday dinner. We had 6:30 reservations and received a seat along the wall so we were able to enjoy a view of the bar and the entire restaurant, which ever table was booked/full by 7:30.  Make reservations if you can.  We ordered the tuna to start, amazing again, and decided to order the Tomahawk Steak (32 oz.) with Brussels Sprouts and their Truffle Mac and Cheese. The steak was unreal, a large rib eye on the bone, check out my picture.  The sprouts were chargrilled with a balsamic glaze, so good and the mac & cheese was good. Just a little too much truffle flavor for me, but good. Cocktails were great and although the service was a little hit or miss this night we enjoyed dinner very much.  I will definitely be back!",

I discovered this place via a rare Sunday Gold Yelp Elite badge event. I was not able to really try everything offered due to pork being in 90% of the offerings. I was told about the ability to leave off the pork on several dishes that were signature dishes which lead us back here while in the area for DateNight out. We had this Trio dish where you get 3 waffle cones one with different fillings. The chicken and shrimp were amazing the tuna was so so. Our server also suggested the tuna app which wasn't that memorable.  The Mac and cheese minus the pork was yummy  I mean the smoke flavor of the smoked cheese as well as the creamy texture full of flavor. My husband ordered a pasta dish with duck and I'm a big Donald Duck, Daffy Duck and Duck Tale fan so I don't eat my buddies but when I tell you I took a piece of this pasta and all the other inclusions and the flavor was undeniable. My husband really enjoyed that dish with the duck I enjoyed it minus the duck .  The dessert menu wasn't appetizing so we opted out of dessert and headed out to another venue for dessert. Not sure I'll be rushing back here but if you like pork definitely check this place out. It's also very cute and intimate for DateNight even if it's only for some cocktails  at the bar. The lighting is low and the staff are suspendered down with Big smiles.",

However, I unfortunately think the beef was bad. I know there have been some ecoli breakouts in Charlotte, so maybe that was the problem. Won't necessarily say the restaurant was bad, but the fact that the meat made me sick questions my desire to return.",

Location: 4/5 Close to the edge of the Tryon Street nightlight in Uptown. There's a parking lot immediately across the street so that's convenient if you're not trying to spend the time to find street parking. You can also park at the 7th Street Market garage as well and hoof it a block and a half.    Atmosphere / Ambiance: 5/5 \"Romantical + Trendy-ish\". Dimly lit but you won't run into tables or have to use the wall to guide yourself out. You don't need to wear a bow-tie, unless that's your think but keep it classy like you would if you lived in San Diego.  Cleanliness: 5/5 Well kept up and clean.  Service: 5/5 The staff was very engaging. Just the appropriate amount of engaging. Not the check on you every 30 seconds which can be annoying but they'll make sure you're enjoying your meal and drinks. If you can't make up your mind, they will gladly point you in the right direction with genuine recommendations or feedback.   Food / Drinks: 5/5 All the food was amazing. Very delicious. The portions  aren't huge so no need for your pants with the stretchy waist bands. The drinks were on point too. There's a good selection of craft beer. I can't remember for sure, but I don't think they share the same massive list of beer as Duckworths upstairs.",

Kinda felt like I was an interruption as opposed to a guest.  Surprised as I asked for feedback on menu (as I leaned toward lighter fare ) that she never shared how \"heavy\" the preparation for their rendition of shrimp and grits... How about when customers inquire about scallops, fish, ahi tuna at least mention the density of other options---and can we hold back on the sodium please!  Mac and cheese was yummy but when the main course is picked through you might want to invest a tad more energy into your customers vs everything ok---yep ok but is that your aim?maqs  If you want heavy food, dark space and bartenders more focused on tomorrow's prep/glass cleaning vs the customer then this should top your list.",

After a couple of failed attempts at getting a seat in this cozy cellar, I got a table with a few friends this past Saturday night for a round of drinks. The atmosphere is very dark and romantic, and we saw more than one couple getting up close and personal in the space.  The cocktail list is extensive and unique, and we were all able to find something to match our tastes, from mezcal to a smoky peach margarita. Be forewarned - the mojito is quite strong! I thought the cocktails were well crafted, but was also disappointed when my Tiki Punch came in a 2 oz shooter rather than being a full cocktail.  If cocktails aren't your thing, then I would just head upstairs for a beer at one of Duckworth's many, many taps. The food looked and smelled good, so I'll have to visit the cellar another time when I have an appetite!",

    "text": "Made the trek from Indian Land to Uptown for an Elite event which turned out to be a great Duckworth's familiarization occasion.  Just about smack in the middle of Charlotte, this is the original location of Duckworth's and we learned a lot about their founding as well as what they offer.  And we ate and drank a few of those offerings.  And this was my first Duckworth's experience.  I can assure you that it will not be my last and here is why.  Cocktails are something they are innovating with.  Popular in the 1920s up until the 1970s and then a resurgence of popularity in the 1990s, another lull and now it appears that Duckworth's is ahead of the resurgence of cocktails in the early 2000s.  Why do I say that?  Three that we sampled:  The French Buck:  Fresh ginger and lemon with gin, vermouth and Prosecco (!) is Duckworth's take on the classic French 75.  Light and flavorful, not alcoholically tasting, what some might refer to as a ladies drink.  My wife would love it as a ginger and lemon lover.  East Village:  As a Manhattan drinker I liked their twist here.  Bourbon and three Amaros (digestives taken mostly as after dinner stomach-settlers...lots of different varieties), topped with a caramelized orange oil.  Wow!  Very smooth and flavorful...best Manhattan I have had.  And the talk of the table was the ice cube.  It was a two inch square of ice that floated in the old fashioned glass, melting slowly and not diluting the drink.  Very cleaver and classy.  Covington's Asian Pear:  Velvety spiced pear and citrus with a smooth foamy top.   Easy to say, but no details.  It was wonderful...like a dessert.  The foam was like whipped egg whites with a couple of dots of bitters.  We all objected that the serving was way too small for the amount of deliciousness it carried.  Another ladies drink.  Classy and good looking as well as complex.  The brief history of Duckworth's was interrupted by so many people rudely talking among themselves, but it was a good talk to hear.  Ask if you have a group here of a full table as you appreciate the history and some facts about Charlotte as well as Duckworth's.  In brief, and probably lacking accuracy, two guys were a bit frustrated in drinking beer served at the wrong serving temperatures.  Different beers are ideally served at one of three general temperatures.  Duckworth's started as a beer place and they now have 110 beers on tap, from three rooms kept at recommended temperatures, and hundreds of other beers in bottles.  Yes, there is a beer cellar which we toured.  Fascinating.  So this is a place to try beers that you have never heard about before.  Of course, Duckworth's expanded in drink and food, the result being where you sit today.  And it will change and innovate as time goes on, I am certain.  When they bought the current uptown location they discovered that the building's concrete foundation was over three feet thick.  Ummmm...turns out that that location was a speakeasy well before national Prohibition went into effect.  That thick waist of concrete was an effective sound barrier.  Further, we learned that Charlotte outlawed alcohol in the early 1900s, two decades or more before Prohibition became national law.  And...although national Prohibition ended in the late 1930s, Charlotte continued to outlaw alcohol until 1953 or so.    We were served five small plates of food to try.  A great opportunity. And this was a drink and snack occasion, not dinner.  Cheese and Charcuterie:  Basically a cheese and little bits assortment.  A warm-up or just something to munch on before dinner...or more small plates, like tapas.  Candied Jalapeno Bacon:  Lardo, pork belly, bacon...just wonderful flavor and crunchiness.  This version was a bit sweet for me, but the jalapeno gave it a nice kick.  Very sugary and, to me, more of a dessert than appetizer.  Soooo good, but not if you are on a health or diet kick.  Caramelized Brussels:  Just what it says but was mixed with smoked pancetta, red onion and LOTS of balsamic.  Just way too much balsamic for me, but did have a rich taste and most liked it.  Truffle Mac & Cheese:  Oh boy!  Rich, thick, small shells of cheesy pasta and LOADED with truffles.  So much so that it was, to me, rather overwhelming.  But, if you like truffles, this is your taste heaven.  The cheese blend was Grafton cheddar, smoked Gouda and, as if you would need more, toasted pancetta.  Finally, Tuna Tartare, complete with the warning about consuming under-cooked seafood.  But the blend of high sushi grade tuna mixed with sesame seeds & chili oil was served with fresh chunky guacamole and fried won ton crisps.  Will have to return to this location or the Ballantyne location which is closer to where I live to have an actual dinner and get into beer samples.   Duckworth's is worth your time, attention and patronage.",

    "text": "Went to check out The Cellar tonight for a couple of reasons. I am SO glad we did. We walked down the stairs to find a laid back place that felt like history and mystery had combined in the best of ways in this sexy speak easy. First, our server Laura took such great care of us. We had the charcuterie board with amazing cheeses, the wild boar, honeycomb, and fig preserves. From there, it just kept getting better.   Brussel sprouts, Truffle Mac & Cheese, Charred Romain Salad, Lemon Risotto...all of it--just fantastic. The star of the whole table though, hands down (or shall I say \"hooves down\") was the candied jalapeno bacon. Really. If you eat nothing else in Charlotte, you must eat this.  We sure did. All of it, without the least trace of decency or shame. It's that good.  We went on to finish off our table of sharable delectables with the french toast. Honestly, we were not in the LEAST bit hungry, but we somehow managed to devour that plate like something out of National Geographic.  So now for the reasons we came: First, a local recommended it as a \"must do\" for our stay. But second and most compelling, we read a review that spoke of an experience we just had a hard time believing could even be True. So we went to satisfy our curiosity. Without going into specifics, we pleasantly found just the opposite of the review we had read (which incidentally, cracked us up--MUCH). When you go--and hopefully you will go SOON--ask for our favorites--Amanda and Dave who make it happen with knowledge, skill, and craftsmanship behind the bar, Laura who we mentioned is an excellent, gracious, attentive server, and the manager Taylor who made sure we were enjoying ourselves and made us feel extremely welcome (even in our yoga pants)--like we had walked into his living room and were his new, close friends.  Overall, I have to say, this place was a highlight of our trip! We did not take the tour of the actual cellar which I'm sure would have been fascinating. But really, I'm glad we didn't. Because now we have a great excuse to come back the next time we're in town--as if we needed anything more than that jalapeno bacon. My only regret here--5 stars on Yelp are just not enough. Thank you, Amanda, Dave, Laura, and Taylor. You have 3 new fans.",

The restaurant is below Duckworths, but once you enter the restaurant, you don't feel like you're below a sports bar in the slightest. The lighting, decor and ambiance is so romantic and rustic.   The drink menu is listed on the iPad with a description and ingredient list. The drinks were delicious. The regular menu isn't overwhelming and has a nice variety of appetizers, sharing plates and main courses. We went with another couple and split 3 items and a dessert and were full.   The service was spectacular and our waitress was very knowledgeable and attentive. You will definitely spend some cash here, so be prepared, but so worth it. Great date spot and will be returning!",

House Made Waffle Cone: 2/5 Despite being advertised as Ponzu Poke, it was probably soy sauce instead, and as a result was salty AF. The chicken sriracha was again, way too salty. The only decent cone was the coconut shrimp. Disappointing.  Roasted vegetables: 3/5 Nothing special. I should have ordered a salad instead because it was drowning in oil.  Duck flatbread: 3/5 Basically duck dust sprinkled onto some flatbread. This was probably the best out of the 3 dishes, but not something I'd recommend.  Our server recommended me a drink that he promised he's \"never had a lady say they didn't like.\" Unfortunately it tasted like Fanta + champagne. Meh. Guess I'll be the first to say it, but I'm sorry, I just didn't like it...or maybe I'm just not a lady :(  Perhaps we just came on an off night? Hope so...",

They closed the entire place for the CIAA tournament two years in a row, I happened to be headed there during the time of both of these tournaments.  What are the odds?  I had friends in town for the tournament one year so I wanted to take them here.  Someone from the establishment commented they don't close for private events, that turned out to be a False statement.  They had closed for private events and they closed down the entire building not just the cellar, but closing all of the building necessarily means you also closes the individual parts.  I am going to give the cellar another chance.  If they are closed or unavailable due to being overcrowded, or something like that I am reverting to my previous stance that this place has availability problems.",

The entrance of Duckworth's is bright, busy, TV-riddled (and a great sports bar), but just down the dark stairs and through a large wood cellar door is a darkened space with beautiful brick walls dotted with glowing sconces, heavy, bar-height wood tables and servers who know their stuff.  There's the obvious Prohibition speakeasy reference, strengthened by the best Gastro pub and cocktail bar in the southern US.",

    "text": "Visited August 22nd  We were considerably excited to visit the Cellar at Duckworth's -- probably the most anticipated opening of the past year for us. Perhaps it was because we were pining for it for so long, but the experience did not live up to expectations.  We arrived soon after they opened and asked to be seated at the bar, which is common for us. The air was not yet circulating, and a distinctive whiff of 'bathroom' was evident. Not many smiles as we arrived either.  We usually enjoy sitting at the bar, conversing with the bartender and receiving attentive service. In this case, the bartender was overly bragadocious, consistently talking up the chef, the beer selection and the restaurant in general. In fact, it was his own boasting about the Yelp score and the backstory of the one bad review that caused me to write this review. As a tip, don't denigrate the people who leave bad reviews - it comes off as defensive. For whatever reason, he insisted on shaking his cocktail creations right in front of us each time, even though there were areas where he could have stood that wouldn't have been in front of anyone. Plus, the bar back was loudly chopping ice at the end of the bar for a long time. For us, the service was just too much and cloying... made for an uncomfortable experience.   One of the biggest reasons we were excited to go the Cellar was the beer. We heard it was to be an elevated beer experience, with access to rare beers and a higher quality selection. We found the evening's draft list to be fairly \"meh.\" While it was True that the selections were lesser known and less often seen in Charlotte, that doesn't mean it was necessarily a great list. Add to that the fact that their beer cooler is not yet available and they had no bottles on-hand. The biggest reason we visited was for the beer and it was not what we expected.  How about the food? The best dish by far was the tuna tartar, which was truly awesome. Almost worth coming back for by itself, served with guacamole and a generous portion for the price. However, the other two small plates we got were below average. The cheese plate was laughably small for the price, with very modest portions of cheese and the typical accoutrements. The smoked salmon flatbread was wafer-thin and somewhat tasteless ('the chef smokes it in-house' the bartender bragged). After such a strong start with the tuna, we found the rest to be fairly pedestrian. We decided to forgo additional small plates and asked for the check.  Will we be back? Probably, but not until they get their act together. And we won't be sitting at the bar. Oh, and like another who left a review, my wife's bag was stained by whatever was near the floor at the bar. She had to throw it away - the stain is still wet?  Atmosphere - 2.5 out of 5 Beer- 2,5 out of 5 Food - 2 out of 5 Overall - 2 out of 5",

Between the four of us, we tried 11 of the dishes (practically half of the menu)! Literally, everything put in front of us was amazing. Everything tasted fresh and was full of flavor. The tapas plates that stood out were the truffle mac & cheese & fried oysters. The entrees that stood out were the 14 oz ribeye & shrimp and grits. Dessert: get the s'more.  Atmosphere and ambiance are unparalleled to any restaurant in Charlotte. Underground, speakeasy vibe, dim lighting, jazz music, knowledgable staff.  The craft cocktails match both the food and the vibe. Made to perfection.  We also got to do a quick tour of the beer cooler before it was stocked. Very cool.  Amazing first experience at The Cellar. Already recommended it to all of my friends. Can't wait to go back and try out the rest of the menu!",

We'd had no reception at all from the hostess at another Uptown restaurant last weekend. This place has the same name, some menu similarities, and beverage list on iPad like our favorite restaurant in Corning, NY. We had a wonderful server, Andrea, who was very nice and helpful. We started by sharing the waffle cones, which I would order again in a second. We also got the Mediterranean Flatbread, which was great, and my husband also ordered the Carmelized Brussels, which he loved. Our only disappointment had nothing to do with the restaurant. We had ordered the Campfire Almond S'mores and a woman came in wearing so much perfume that allergies flared for us both and we had to ask for it to be boxed to take home. It was still really good, but it would have been nice to have it straight from the kitchen.  While we were there, the general manager, Charles, came by to introduce himself and chat about our experience, and Andea was attentive during our time there. I like the atmosphere, which reminded me so much of a restaurant in Wilmington, NC, where I worked one summer during college.  We will be returning soon!",

Everything about this restaurant is amazing - the location (walkable from just about anywhere in Uptown), decor, ambiance, drinks and food. I went with a friend on a Sunday night without a reservation but we were seated immediately at the high bar in the middle of the restaurant. It was fine for the two of us as we had open seats next to us, but might have been a little cramped if the table had been full.   We started with the truffle Mac and cheese and the waffle cone trio. The Mac and cheese came out very quickly and was incredible; rich, decadent, filling. We were glad we split it, there's a lot of food! The waffle cones came out shortly thereafter and were just as fabulous. I liked the chicken bacon Sirracha and the coconut shrimp the best.   For our main meals, we split both the scallops and the chicken breast. Both were delicious. The chorizo on both dishes was a fun addition and everything was cooked to perfection. My only complaint is that I wanted to lay down at the table because I was so stuffed!   We also had the Lumen IPA on draft and a beer recommended to us by our server from the cellar. Both were good. My only complaint and the reason I am rating 4/5 stars is that I was hoping for out of this world drink recommendations, and our waiter seemed hung up on two beers he had already recommended. Overall it was an excellent experience and I will definitely be returning!",

But the beer list...  oh, the beer list.  Best bottle list I've ever seen, and that's actually saying a lot.  It's not IPA-heavy, which is not a bad thing - ~450 bottles, some of which are vintage, and a great selection of local vintage stouts and barleywines.

Served fresh and hot.  Only hesitation is that lunch cost me almost $17 with a tip for good service.  It is one of only a few good restaurants in the area which has many restaurants not as good.",

The beer list was fantastic, and everything was made to order. I pesonally had the smoked salmon flatbread for the small plate, and the saffron fettucine. They didn't have the Cellar Burger that night, which was sort of disappointing, but I was very happy with what I had. My dinner date had the grilled shrimp & ld kill cheddar grits. Her plate was great, even though the shrimp was a bit overcooked. Overall, I highly reccomend this spot for a date, or even a night out with the buds. Will defintely return.",

You'll feel like you stepped into another era as soon as you walk downstairs. An air of mystery with the hostess outside the sliding door. Once inside, The Cellar is the perfect size to feel exclusive with a fun 1920s vibe. We tried a few small plates which were good, but the star of the show is definitely their drink list. All of the cocktails sounded delicious, but I went with the Avery Raspberry Sour Ale. They have unique beers that you can't find anywhere else in Charlotte and I love the way everything was presented. Definitely recommend checking out this unique addition to the Uptown scene.",

All of it was delicious! There was no bad comments on the flavors or timing. Couple reasons why this isn't a 5 star. First thing is we go there a little early and wanted to just grab a drink at the bar. The hostess told us to go up stairs to do that when there was a full bar downstairs. Secondly The floor was so slippery everywhere you walked, even in the restrooms. The workers stated it was from the humidity, which I could see. BUT they need to put mats down or figure something out because it's definitely a lawsuit if someone falls. Thirdly the risotto came out when we were about to get the bill.  The worker did apologize and took it off out bill.  Those were the only bummers. But we did have a wonderful time here.",

You walk downstairs and are greeted by a host/hostess and enter into a funky gastropub type restaurant. You're handed a tablet that lists countless cocktails to choose from and a separate food menu. We had just eaten dinner, but we ordered the delicious brussel sprouts that we were told we had to try before leaving.   A few of the cocktails we tried were the Mezcal Thymencello, Where There's Smoke, Dee Had An Aviator, Pamelos (with a \"secret ingredient\"), etc. All were mouth-wateringly enjoyable. The bartenders Chloe and Jamison were absolutely awesome in every aspect of our time at The Cellar. They were extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful; another coworker of theirs was awesome enough to tell us all about an event happening that weekend that we were curious of.  From the ambiance and the cocktails to the service, the only way to describe the entirety of our dining experience is beyond exceptional.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and their staff! Absolutely phenomenal!",

    "text": "Exceptional service, incredible food, and mind-blowing drinks. Our waiter was very friendly and passionate about his job and made us some great recommendations. The ambience of the cellar is also great--dark, brick, exposed beams. We arrived at 5 and there were only 3 or 4 other guests at the time. They kept steadily arriving and the place was packed within the hour.  The interior is modeled after a speakeasy and appropriately so because while the food was delicious and well worth the price, it was the drinks that really amazed us. My fiance got his fav--a whiskey sour. It's a drink he's gotten all across the U.S., and this one was his very favorite. I got the corpse reviver 2017 and it had really delicious layered flavors. The anise -- not over powering, just perfect -- really made this drink exceptional. They use no premixes at The Cellar. Every time someone ordered a smokey drink, you could smell them smoking it up on the spot! One of the perks of the place.  The cheese plate was solid but also could be raised to the next level. My fiance asked for the chef's recommendations and they brought us cheddar, gruyere, and gouda--pretty predictable picks, but still delicious. The gruyere was the winner of the three by our estimate. The cheese portions were generous, but I would have preferred smaller portions with more varieties of cheese at the same price point.The accompaniments were really great -- honey and fig jelly, walnuts that arrived warm, and bread that was slightly grilled.   I got the black grouper, which comes with pesto rice, candied carrots, and artichokes. The pictures I took didn't do it justice so I'm not including them--it was beautiful, but the light too dim for photography. Usually I'm not crazy about rice with a fish dish, because it seems like restaurants treat the rice as a throwaway, or just do something \"good enough.\" That was not the case with this rice--it was delicious and added to the flavor of the overall dish. The carrots and artichokes were also perfectly prepared and added important flavor ways to the dinner experience.  My fiance got the Kansas City Strip. He likes his steak a bit chewier, which made this one lose points for him, but even so it's just a bit below the best steak he's ever had (and he's had a lot!). He also ordered a glass of wine--a nebbiolo. He says is really hard to find that varietal (his fav) by the glass and so he couldn't resist!  We can't wait to return to The Cellar. We wanted to try all of their drinks, and we didn't even get to their incredible beer list!",

When you walk downstairs and through the sliding door, it doesn't feel like you're in Charlotte anymore. You're transported into a speakeasy-Gatsby type world.   The bar program is outstanding. From the carefully crafted drinks (be patient when you order) to their impressive beer cellar (seriously, they have more than 500 options), Bar Manager/Mixologist Ron does such an amazing job. Two of my favorites are the Blackberry Mescal and Where There's Smoke. My last visit here, Ron made me a Smoked Buttered Pecan Old Fashioned. Not only was it delicious, the presentation was incredible (IG-worthy AF).   It's important here to trust your server and ask questions. The staff does a great job walking you through menus and offering recommendations. Food-wise I really love the fire roasted shishito peppers (I seriously could eat the entire bowl by myself), candied jalapeno bacon (guys, it's BACON in a brown sugar GLAZE), and ground duck flatbread (delicious flavor combo of house ground duck, sundried tomato, pear, mushroom, balsamic fig reduction). I honestly have never had a bad dish here. Note: some dishes make more sense for sharing than others.   The place is not huge, so they only do reservations until 9pm. Otherwise, it's first come, first serve. I'm a big fan of sitting at the bar. Parking, there is a paid lot on the other side of 7th. You also have the parking deck next to Rock Bottom (diagonally across Tryon). Try to look for a spot on the street, it's free after 6pm. Just make sure to pay attention to the metered spots and signage.",

That said, the vibe is cool and the food, beer  whisky, and handmade cocktails are awesome.  The filet, not usually a steak I would order, was highly recommended by the bartenders and it didnt disappoint. A great steak cooked in an 1800 degree oven with just a side of lightly dressed arugula topped with parm shavings. We ordered the Carolina Gold Kimchi fried rice (nicely spicy) to share which I used as a side for my steak too. The Tuna Tartare, another dish that has been overdone everywhere, was much better here than what you find in too many restaurants to count.  The Cellar Smash was a standout cocktail.  A great place if you just know that you're not going for a quiet date.",

    "text": "Had dinner and drinks at The Cellar At Duckworth's on Sunday night. For drinks we had Where There's Smoke, Smoked Buttered Pecan Old Fashioned, and a Classic NY Gin Sour. To eat we shared the Ground Duck Flatbread, Tuna Tartare, and Butter Basted Scallops.  Quality The Cellar At Duckworth's turned out to be one of the highlights of my short trip to Charlotte. Excellent drinks and outstanding food in a very stylish environment. We started the evening my each selecting a cocktail, I went with the Smoked Buttered Pecan Old Fashioned. It was probably my least favorite of the cocktails I tried, but still very fun. I would recommend saving it for after dinner, as it is quite sweet. My girlfriend started with Where There's Smoke, a spicy smoked peach margarita. It was delicious and came with a real kick. Before the evening was over we also had a Classic NY Gin Sour, which combined gin, rhone wine, lime, simple syrup and egg whites in a fun and flavorful concoction. And while I came in expecting some tasty drinks, it was the food that really impressed. First, I had some of the delicious Ground Duck Flatbread, which came with duck, sun-dried tomato, pear, mushroom, and a balsamic fig reduction. Next was the Tuna Tartare, which came with a generous portion of fresh tuna, topped with sesame seeds and chili oil. On the side came chunky guacamole and wonton crisps. Mixed together was a fresh, rich, sweet, and spicy bite. Then there was the Butter Basted Scallops, which I believe are a must order. Served with this mix of currants, cauliflower, turmeric, and chorizo, the accompaniments were nearly as good as the main attraction.  Quantity The drinks were a good size and contained a fair amount of alcohol. For food I came in expecting more snacks than meals, but each dish was large and hearty.  Value Expect to pay around $15 for the signature cocktails, which was high, but not unreasonably so. The food meanwhile varies greatly as they have plenty of appetizers and snacks in the under $15 range, but also large plates from $30 to $60.  Ambiance The Cellar At Duckworth's is located in the Uptown area of Charlotte. This speakeasy-style bar and restaurant is nestled beneath a more casual restaurant in Duckworth's. To enter you first walk down a set of stairs to meet a host in the dimly lit waiting area. The walls are brick and a large sliding door blocks the restaurant itself. When it is your turn to enter they slide the door open and you enter the tightly packed dining area with a long bar on the far wall. Everything about the space has been carefully constructed to make it look and feel like a prohibition era secret space. Wood and bricks give the basement an unfinished look, but also stylistic charm. Dim lights hang from the wall, but allow strategically placed candles to do the work. Towards the back they have a storage room full of their large beer collection. The music is a mix of jazz and R&B and the the staff are dressed very dapper. It is a fun spot and one that fully embraces the spirit of the 20s.  Crowd It is a small space and on weekend evenings it fills up fast. Since we did not have reservations we were relegated to the last seats in the bar area. I highly recommend making advance reservations, because if we had showed up even a few minutes later we likely would have had a long wait. Also, do not be fooled by the casual sports bar on the ground floor, the cellar is much more sophisticated and intimate. It makes for a nice date spot or a location when trying to impress.   Service The host did not make the best impression, but everyone else in the place was incredible. The girls behind the bar were delightful and very enthusiastic about the drinks they were creating. It was also clear that everyone from the bartenders to the waiters, believed in what the restaurant was doing. They beamed as they described the selection of high quality beer, great unique cocktails, and awesome food.  Parking Located in the Uptown area of Charlotte, we made the walk over from our hotel. However, I saw a paid lot across the street and a few garages in the area.  Extra The Cellar At Duckworth's is simply great. Drinks, food, service, and style all make it a wonderful place for dinner and cocktails. Just make sure you grab reservations because the magic of this secret bar is definitely not a secret around town.",

    "text": "Quite possibly the worst experience we've had. Visiting the area we were excited to try this restaurant.  The hostess told us it was \"kind of like a 5 Star\" restaurant.  Then she sat us at the bar (in a completely empty dining room)  Our food was cold and mediocre at best.  The bottle of beer we ordered was 2 years past expiration.  When we told the waitress we didn't really like our appetizer she stormed off and didn't come back. We had to ask a waiter from the dining room to refill water.  We paid, then complained. The manager offered us a free meal but it was so bad we would never ever return, free or not.",

As spooky as that sounds, it's equally exciting, and cool. You are lead downstairs where you enter an actual cellar. The ambiance is as romantic an environment as I've ever encountered, from the dim lighting, to the small, intimate setting... I only wish that my GF could've been there with me. I won't lie, the tables are a little closer than I would've liked, but that doesn't take away from the incredible experience, service, and food.   I promise you this, I will dine at The Cellar every single time I visit Charlotte, NC.   It was that good.",

The service was also great for Sunday football - we didn't feel like we were being rushed out. I know I shouldn't take a star off for this but it really is still bothering me -- the reason this place doesn't get 5 stars from me is because the male bartender on Monday night was extremely rude and downright pretentious. Next time we'll sit back at a table for a better experience. Really upsetting but worth a visit back as long as we don't sit at the bar, he doesn't deserve our tips!",

If you sat at a table with someone, you literally had to yell for them to hear. Maybe it was just a loud night, but not a first date type of place. However, it was would be a good place with a group of friends.   The food was okay. The truffle fries were too salty, the waffle cones were okay...nothing spectacular. Now the glazed bacon was yummy! It was sweet, salty, and spicy...perfect balance for the bacon. The drinks are smaller in person. The pictures from some Yelp reviews made the drinks look larger and the food more bountiful. Remember this is a tapas like place.   Overall it was an good place.",

The reason it's 4 stars and not 5 is that the last two times I was there I was quoted a 30 minute wait.  On both occasions the restaurant was nearly empty and remained nearly empty not just for the 30 minutes but for the duration of my meal. This gives the distinct impression that they are not interested in my business as a lone business traveler.  I wish the food wasn't so good because i'd loved to write this restaurant off.",

I can never just crave an evenings at the cellar and actually satisfy that craving.

I understand the desire to maintain some sort of exclusivity, but at this rate.. I don't think I will go back. That makes me sad, but with the growing number of bars in the city, I'll get over it :)   If you are lucky and get there early enough and score a seat at the bar or even a table, it'll be a great experience; their food is good and drinks are great!

I vacillated with giving either a 3-star or or 4-star review based on some highs and lows of our experience, but decided to round up because I definitely want to go back.   We managed to snag seats at the bar, which we were excited about watching the bartenders work their magic.There are certainly some inventive cocktails on the menu, but it was tough to share the iPad between two people when we both wanted to oogle the drink list. It would be helpful to maybe stick to a traditional paper menu for the cocktails since those are more limited in choice compared to the beer list.The bartenders were super friendly with us, but we definitely heard them kvetching about co-workers and other patrons. This was amusing for us to listen to, but probably not the most appropriate behavior on their part.    Everything on the food menu sounded great, so we had some tough choices to make. We settled on the shrimp and grits, truffle fries, scallops, and brussel sprouts.We enjoyed everything that we ordered, but, the pacing was a bit off. The fries came out like almost immediately, the scallops and shrimp and grits came out maybe 15 minutes later, but the brussel sprouts didn't arrive for maybe another 20 minutes after that. We honestly had debated about canceling them because it had taken so long in comparison to everything else that we had ordered.",

    "text": "So it looks like I will be in Charlotte for a bit and wanted to start the trip off with some good food and drinks. Was able to meet up with a friend and we decided to hit up the Cellar based on all the rave reviews. Wrapped up work and made the walk over to this joint which you will see by the signs. You do in fact have to walk down the stairs and when I did, I knew it was already going to be good. The greeters are extremely friendly and were happy to accommodate our seating at the bar.   The interior of this joint is pretty slick and definitely has that speakeasy vibe. There are plenty of tables across the sides of the wall, higher tables in the middle, and the seats at the bar itself. The bartenders were super friendly and was very knowledgeable about their drinks. They had a solid selection of whiskeys and I was happy to continue drinking a variety of different whiskeys. The drink menus are provided on an IPAD so it is quick to scroll through your potential options. My friend had a cocktail which he said was spot on and he tried a few other ones saying they were all solid. We decided to order food as well which ended up being the tuna tartare and the burger. The tuna was pretty solid and came with wonton chips which I could not help but sneak a bite even though it was against my diet. It came with guacamole was a good compliment making this an all around solid starter. The burger was solid and the gruyere cheese was the right choice for it. It was cooked right to my liking and was definitely chowed down in no time.  All in all, a good spot with great drink choices, good ambiance, friendly servers, and good food. What more can you ask for?",

    "text": "First night in Charlotte for a NYE celebration with my hubby and, after all the restaurant research I did, I was set on eating dinner here but had somehow misunderstood that they don't take reservations; turns out, for Fri/Sat dining, they recommend two week's notice. My disappointment was short lived, however, when they were able to identify a couple of spots at the bar (which is first come, first serve) within about 20 minutes.   It is worth mentioning that during that 20 minutes, we stepped upstairs to Duckworth's sports bar for a drink; that establishment's beer menu could not be more poorly laid out and the food menu looked average at best - a quick peruse of Yelp confirmed that. How this place and the Cellar are so aligned by proximity is unfortunate because they couldn't be more different.   I read other reviews re: the atmosphere of the Cellar to be a \"speak easy\" vibe and that is totally spot on. The dim lighting and exposed brick along with the sense that you are tucked away in the depths of a building feel a bit forbidden (AKA prohibition) and romantic.   Our place at the bar turned out to be ideal because of how fun and interesting it is to watch the skilled bartenders work; these are professionals who have mastered their craft and if you want an outstanding cocktail made to perfection, you've come to the right place. If cocktails aren't your thing, you can still expect them to be incredibly knowledgeable about the excellent wine and beer choices available.   Just one example - my hubby ordered a traditional whiskey sour that he declared \"tremendous\" and then asked for another cocktail BASED on a whiskey sour...essentially, the same but different. The bartender (Amanda - so great!) asked if it had to be bourbon or if she could experiment with a blended scotch - my husband was game and so glad for it as her \"invention\" was even better than the original.   For food, we couldn't leave without trying the truffle fries and they are everything you would hope for and expect - get them. My hubby did the waffle cone trio and while he enjoyed the contents of each very much, he determined the cones were not necessary nor did they add to the flavor profile...they were just a novel way to present the food. He also did the trio of tacos and said each was \"outstanding\" and he would absolutely order those again. For me, I had the lemon risotto with tomatoes,  asparagus, goat cheese, shaved Parmesan and almonds (for crunch and flavor) - - it was hands down the best risotto I've ever eaten and I'm still fantasizing about it as if it were a tawdry love affair! The creamy goodness of it was comforting but balanced with the refreshing zing of citrus all prepared to perfection.   I cannot say enough good things about this place; when in Charlotte, we will definitely be back!",

The hummus was typical hummus but they served it with a fresh tomato, cucumber and feta cheese salad tossed in mustard seeds which was really delicious! Another friend got the waaffle cones and she siad they were delicious. My other friend who was oretty hangry when we arrived, ordered the burger and fries and she was a very happy lady.  The Cellar has become my new favorite place for small plates. It's running neck and neck with Soul. But this is THE BEST place to get char grilled oysters in Charlotte! I want to shout about this place from the rooftop but I also want to keep it our little secret. It's definitely a hidden gem in the heart of crown town!!!",

    "text": "OK... very disappointed with this place.... and wondering if there is something wrong with me given so many positive reviews here on yelp? Came here with a friend Tuesday night and nothing absolutely nothing we ordered was great. On the contrary, we ordered 3 apps, 1 entree and 1 dessert to share and I could say with confidence I would never go back again to eat any of these dishes. Everything was salty and just heavy to the point a couple bites and I couldn`t keep eating. Big portions. We didn`t get even close to finish any of the dishes and kinda felt 'forced' to eat just because we had ordered. Not sure if we just didn`t choose the 'right' things off the menu... or if there was a different cook tonight but how can you screw up fries and dessert? My friend is from NYC and I work in NYC and we both travel for work all the time and not being a snob or anything but from a food standpoint a totally let down. I would not come back for the food. Perhaps for the drinks since the ambiance, management and staff was superb.",

You'll see the duckworth's sign, go in,'and immediately when you walk in there is a a set of stairs. Go down them and you are there!   There was a little bit of a wait and you cannot just go drink at the bar without actually being seated by a hostess.   The drink menu is listed on an iPad. I had the red rum drink which was delicious and took about 10 minutes to hand make.   As far as small plates we smaller the waffle cones which sound weird but the flavor profile is the sweet and savory of the meat is amazing. The chicken was crispy and the shrimp crusted coconut was perfectly browned and crunchy.  The Rissoto was good however the rice was a bit too crunchy for me.  Overall I would like to come here for drinks for sure more often as well as sample more food.",

First off, the atmosphere is awesome...walking down dark stairs to a hostess who then slides open a doorway to reveal what looks like a speakeasy.  Even the music and the staff's attire says speakeasy.   My group ordered several different rounds of beers from the knowledgeable server and a bunch of small plates.  Charcuterie was great (although the cheese portion was woefully inadequate and there wasn't enough jam on the board either).  Other apps we loved were the brussels sprouts, the tacos, cones and in particular the grilled oysters.  And the food came quicker than we could finish it!.    We then ordered dinner (and more drinks).  I had the filet, which was cooked to perfection and came with an arugula and shaved parmesan side.  Others enjoyed the shimp and grits (though it may have been spicier than advertised), grouper, scallops and their hamburger, which was awesome.  Will definitely be back as this place is unlike anything else in Charlotte.",

    "text": "As out of town visitors I rely on yelp quite a bit for dining. We were in Charlotte for my brother's graduation and wanted a splurge dinner. We are foodies and wanted a nice atmosphere and great food. We were very pleased when we walked into the Cellar. It was dark, intimate, with exposed brick and beams. It literally felt like you were in this cozy hide away gem that not everyone knows about yet. The waiter explained to us that they were going for a speakeasy type theme, and well it works!!! Our service was impeccable and the waiter was very knowledgeable about EVERYTHING on the menu. I went with his drink suggestions and his wine suggestions with the food and it was spot on. The Cellar has an actual beer cellar so it has more beer selections than you can imagine. The cocktails are all handcrafted. Everything is muddled with fresh fruit, fresh ginger etc. There are no mixes used. We even saw a bartender light a piece of wood on fire and fill a pint glass up with smoke to infuse in a drink!       Now for the food...we did a lot of tasting dishes. We started with the waffle cone small plates. It sounded interesting, but the mix of spices with the sweet waffle cones were very complimentary of each other. Next we moved onto the trio of tacos and found that the pork belly taco was to die for! My brother was craving steak so he went with the filet. The filet was cooked with just simple spices in a double broiler that is 1600 degrees, so the steak has a nice char while being perfectly cooked on the inside. We split the shrimp and grits. They were old mill cheddar grits with a sort of shrimp etouffee, topped with a 6 minuted cooked egg. I literally would have licked the bowl if I had not been in public. We of course had to try two desserts, the campfire smores and the cornflake crusted french toast. The French toast was good dessert, it had a lot of bread and after all of that food...it was too much for me. The smore however, was out of this world.      We only encountered one snafu and a burger was brought to our table instead of the steak we ordered....no big deal...it looked amazing! They discounted our steak..... which was crazy...b/c we did not complain or even care really!  All and all this place focuses on amazing food, outstanding service, and unique drinks. I loved every last morsel and the whole experience! I will definitely go back when I am back in Charlotte...and when I do I will get the divine looking burger and the truffle mac and cheese!  Food for thought: If you are going here for a quick drink and a quick bite, maybe stay upstairs in the taproom. While our food was perfectly coursed out...this is somewhere you should go to enjoy yourself. The price point is perfect, you can go and spend as little or as much as you desire!",

I sent an associate there later and he said his scallops and Asparagus were amazing. I've heard such great things about their craft cocktails it's what I'm looking forward to next time. I also love the mini history lesson we got about the previous use of the restaurant. Shows that the people care about their restaurant and always makes a great experience for me!",

My friends and I wanted to check out the Cellar, as I heard it was a cool experience.  We walked downstairs and the young lady sitting at the reception desk was chatting up a guy.  She never gave us eye content or asked if we needed help.  After standing there for a minute I thought I would poke my head in to see if there was a bar where we could stand and have a drink.  Before I could put a step in the breezeway the young lady, and I use that term loosely, stuck her finger in my face and said \"Uhh.....wait\" and then turned back to her conversation.  Luckily for her my friends pulled me out, as it was not going to end well for her.  We walked outside and then decided to head back to communicate our displeasure to the manager.  He listened to our feedback and said he was going to speak to her that evening.  I don't think that he had enough urgency for the situation, as she should have been addressed immediately.  Don't waste your time hear.  I heard that they have a low health rating anyway.  Walk on by!",

While waiting for my friends to arrive, I ordered the Mezcul Mule.  Very tasty!  They had a huge selection of cocktails and I was torn because I didn't know which to choose.  What made me really excited though was how hot the bartenders were. Good God! And the suspenders made them even sexier ;)  My friends finally arrive and we are sat immediately at our table.  We decide to just order a bunch of small plates.  We chose the burger, truffle fries, houmus plate, cheese plate, the waffle cones and the lamb chops.  Everything was extremely delicious!  The waffle cones were presented in a board that had 3 holes.  One was tuna, one chicken, and one beef.  The burger was succulent.  The cheeses and meats on the cheese plate were very tasty and the houmus was great as well.  The service also was excellent.  I highly recommend this place.",

I got the saffron fettuccine and he got the hangar steak.  Mine seemed to be missing something to make it pop, my first thought would be pancetta, but another strong flavor might do.  The biggest negative for hangar steak was the polenta \"fries\" were tasty, but needed a saucy to dip in since they were a tad bland and dry.

This place makes some work intensive drinks that are very entertaining to watch being concocted (smoke-filled glasses, flame-toasted lemon peels, splash of who knows what, dash of that, shaken, stirred, whirled and poured in an extravagant demonstration) . Small, but inventive menu. Maybe too inventive? Overall, cocktail and food menu seem to be trying too hard to impress. Execution on the more tame scallop with cauliflower and elderberry dish was excellent, though. My companion went for the more adventurous taco trio (1 each chicken, pork belly, shrimp) and was very pleased. All of the dishes and drinks we saw pass by looked delicious and very nicely plated. Not too much left on the plates on their way to the dishwasher either, so others must've been pleased, too. Fabulous ambiance downstairs, which is unexpected based on the sports bar vibe upstairs.",

    "text": "I never thought I'd write a 5 star review at all, due to being very picky about food & service. I definitely didn't think a 5 star review would happen in the Duckworths building, but that was before a friend told me about what lies underneath the main floor (of good beer but mediocre food).   Same owner as upstairs, but a completely different world downstairs in The Cellar. Intimate & a little dark, but not in a bad way.  Plenty of servers checking in, and a Manager who personally walks around & makes sure everyone is more than satisfied.   That's all nice, but the big deal for me was the food itself. I made the comment on the first night (we went two nights in a row) that it was the best food I've had in Charlotte, & I've eaten at probably 30 restaurants during many business trips.   The oyster app is a must get. Oysters that are fresh, cooked just right, & with an amazing sauce that you can soak up with the included bread strips.   Two of us got the seared scallops on the first night, with chorizo & corn mixture & small portions of several different sauces. Wish I could remember all the ingredients, but all I can say is the flavor was incredible when all mixed together. Again, scallops were fresh & cooked perfectly.    The second night I got the grouper on a bed of pesto rice with seared shallots & candied carrots.  I grew up on the coast of Florida eating fish right off the boats on a daily basis. To say I'm picky about fish is like saying that it's unpleasant to have my foot run over by a car.  Same as above..... Fresh and cooked just right.  It flaked apart with very little effort & was nice and moist inside.   It's been a while since I was this enthused about a restaurant & I thought I was just getting jaded, but The Cellar reminded me that there are still great discoveries out there.",

All were phenomenal, and the perfect amount of food to share & fill us up.  The cocktails are especially what will make me come back, and if you order, sit at the bar.  Half the enjoyment of the cocktail was watching Ron & John make them.  They light $hit on fire! The only thing I didn't like was the initial \"exclusivity\" that they are seeming to promote... one earlier Yelper hit it right on the head when she said \"the hostess who makes it seem like you're breaking in to a bank if you walk in without talking to her\".  Nobody was in the restaurant yet, & she huffed & puffed at others in front of us that walked past her to the empty bar.  Do a better job of greeting them when they walk down the stairs if you don't want them to walk past you.",

You can also sit at one of the many tables to dine. My favorite aspect of The Cellar is the spur beer cellar. It's unreal! Beer and whiskey lovers, enjoy!",

As soon as we walked into the bar, our small group was made to leave by the extremely bitter hostess only to be brought back in and sat at the bar. All of the bartenders are cold, evasive, and to be honest rude. After ordering a drink and asking to hold the simple syrup, which is a standard and simple request, I was told they would not make it for me if I was going to complain it was \"too bitter\" after trying it. I can only assume this is due to being a female ordering a straight whiskey drink. Overall, the experience of our group was subpar at best; it would be most accurate to say the staff acts pained to serve guests.  Additionally, after we left and were able to see our clothing, purses, and bags in the sunlight, they are all stained from the paint on the bar.",

When we walked in I really liked the atmosphere, its a smaller place, kind of dark but as it got crowded it got really loud. I think if we went back with a group we wouldn't be able to talk to each other. It is definitely not a cheap place, my drink, Blackberry Julep was very good but was more than any of the food we ordered. The service was great. We ordered small plates to share instead of an entree. We had the Waffle Cones (1 chicken, 1 shrimp, 1 tuna) what was in the cone was good but the cone you can really only eat the top as it gets thicker you can't even chew it. Next was the Truffle Mac n Cheese (wasn't like any mac n cheese we have had before) but was AWESOME.  I would go back just for this. Then we had the 3 Tacos (very small 1 octopus, 1 pulled chicken, 1 pork belly) We also liked all of these.  We never get dessert but I had to try the Corn Flake Crust French Toast (unlike the small plates this was HUGE. Vanilla ice cream with cinnamon, the french toast covered with Bananas Foster with a few berries and some whipped cream) Very good, I actually took the rest of the French Toast home minus the ice cream and ate it for breakfast the next day. They will explain that everything takes time but I really liked having the time in between each plate so wasn't a problem for us. Would go back and probably try an entree next time.",

It took our server 10 minutes to approach our table after we sat. And even longer to bring our appetizers to our table.  We ordered a drink from the bar, and that took 15 minutes to deliver.  The food was okay but I'm sure that's been distorted for me by the mediocre service. I will say everyone was nice and the manager visited our table to resolve some of the issues.  The aesthetics were nice and low key and had a very chilled vibe.  But for what your paying for food as this place, I expect more. As I said in the beginning,  this might be a one off and I'm willing to try this place again.",

We visited Charlotte for the weekend and let me tell you this place ruins all other places. Wish we'd skipped 5church the night before and ate here all weekend! We were promptly seated with a reservation on a calm Sunday evening.  Atmosphere-small, perfectly dim with nice lighting, calm but a good vibe. We felt free to talk and laugh but we could still hear each other!  Service-Our server, Bobby, was both incredibly kind, and informed. He was ready with suggestions, full descriptions of all drinks and food, and checked in just enough. We were never waiting for a refill, and his suggestions were great. The GM also checked in and gave us a tour of the beer collection, a must see. Ask about the private lockers! Drinks- We were beginning to think no one in Charlotte knew how to make a bourbon drink. So happy to be proved wrong here! We bonded with the GM over visiting bourbon distilleries in Kentucky. I had the Smoked Whiskey Sour, my boyfriend had the Old Fashioned. Both were incredible and perfectly prepared. We finished our meal with the Vieux Carre...the best bourbon drink I've had.  Food-We started the evening with the truffle mac n cheese. The couple next to us suggested this was life changing. They weren't wrong, the perfect blend of truffles, Gouda, and smokiness. We finished the whole rich dish, and it's plenty to share between two. I ordered the Duck Ragu, and my boyfriend the filet mignon. The Duck Ragu had thin wide noodles, perfect ground Duck, sun dried tomatoes all in a garlic cream sauce. Rich and delicious. The real star here though is the filet...perfect medium cook but this amazing crispy char on the outside. It was served with a light salad and a peppercorn sauce. Every bite was perfect. We decided to drink our dessert so I can't speak to that, but I'm sure it matches the level of the food. The price is also right, for this level of food quality we were very impressed with the pricing. We would return to Charlotte just to dine here again. Bravo!",

We spent most our time at the upstairs bar as the downstairs dining had a 45 min wait which I understand is typical for this spot. Our bartender was amazing and incredibly knowledgeable. We sampled dozens of IPA's. We enjoyed the bar so much that we nearly forgot we were waiting. Downstairs is very elegant with a speak easy vibe. Ambiance is very dark which typically turns me off but I found the environment very comfortable. Food was amazing! I had the taco trio. As our plates arrived we were given little lessons about the ingredients and preparation. After dinner we toured the cellar and learned even more. At no point did I feel I was just out to eat. From the moment we sat down, the night became a complete experience. I'm proud that such a spot exist in my city.",

The burger was nothing spectacular and the mini tacos we're legit mini. My main complaint is the $17 martini I was served. I inquired about their drink menu, asking if they had other martinis. The server informed me that the bartender could make a chocolate cherry martini and asked what kind of vodka I liked. I told her nothing crazy, but not Wells either. While I was drinking the martini I had others at the table taste it, as it tasted off. Not bad, just a little weird. When we relieved the bill, I figured out why. I was charged $12 for Jameson Reserve and $5 for other liquors. When I inquired about the Jameson, as I thought I was getting vodka, I was told they had to make it that way. No one told me this, what if brown liquor made me angry!?  It left a poor impression that there was no communication and I was charged $17 for something I really didn't enjoy.",

We had a few cocktails and they were delicious. I had the French Buck which was their take on the French 75. Pretty tasty with very interesting flavors. Also tried the New York Sour Gin. It tasted a lot like a sweet tart. Not exactly my style but I could definitely appreciate what they tried to do with he flavor combo.   The food was a definite highlight. I ordered their pappardelle duck ragu, candied jalapeno bacon, and the cellar burger. Each dish was better than the last. The portion sizes were definitely more tapas than meal (other than burger though the fries were a tiny portion size). I will say that the flavor of the duck did not come across well in the ragu. I think it would be better to have bigger cuts of the duck rather than the tiny little pieces you could barely taste. But other wise we Really enjoyed our date.",

The dishes were delicious, unfortunately I didn't know things were fried in peanut oil, and it limited my options. It was written really teeny tiny on the bottom. The parpadelle was delicious, and the side of 'shrooms were, honestly the best part of the meal. The cheese plate was not impressive and did not have the best variety, and were all hard cheeses, minus the blue, and not something I would order again, and the charcuterie, the bresaola specifically was dried out. The cocktails are very \"speakeasy\"  and fun and unique. Oddly enough our waitress was great but the hostess were rude. Our reservation was at 8:00, so we arrived then and were told our table wasn't ready. They said they told \"one of us that they would text us\". When they sat us they plopped down the menus and walked away quickly. So besides the hostess, everything was good. I mean the food is the most important part anyway!",

Food: 3, Service: 3, Atmosphere: 3 Cost to worth it rating: 2.5 (small plates ~$15, entrees ~$20, steaks starting at $49) Opentableable: yes Return worthiness: unlikely   Highlights: - Steak: my hub's a meat guy and really enjoyed his rib eye. Thought it was good quality and cooked well. 4 stars - Cocktails: use all quality liquors and house-made syrups which I appreciate and few interesting twists. I got a pecan old fashioned which was nice. 4 stars  - Cone appetizer: points for creativity--a larger variety version of Thomas Keller's classic version. Fried siracha chicken, fried coconut shrimp, and tartare. Cones themselves were great and fillings were all fine but the shrimp one was overpowered by the dark thick sweet sauce it was in. 3.25 stars - Truffle mac and cheese: I heard raves but was pretty standard. Huge macaroni shells and could've been a bit cheesier. 3.25 stars - Grouper: was just ok being quite bland but I enjoyed the pesto Carolina gold rice risotto. 3 stars   Midlights: - Bit confusing with the multi-levels with a standard well lit sports bar on the top. - Duck parpadelle: noodles were good and sauce was fine and not too creamy, but the ground sausage texture didn't eat well. 3 stars - Atmosphere: dark and speakeasy like to set a mood, but wish it was a bit more fun instead of formal. - Ipad cocktail list: I've seen this many places before but this one was cumbersome as you had to click into each cocktail to see what it was and each wine to get a description and then back again to check another. If they wanted to compress the list, a show/hide method would be preferred.  Lowlights: - Hostess was quite standoffish, condescending, and rude when we checked in which I did not appreciate. Not the typical friendly southern greeting which did not start the evening there on the right foot. - Being seated at a high bar tables with unstable wobbly chairs was not comfortable at all--and we had a reservation made weeks before.  Good for a fancy cocktail, but between the greeting and pretentious vibe without the food to back it up, I'll likely try another spot when in the area.",

    "text": "I have dined at the Cellar many times, and it has continuously left me somewhat underwhelmed. They have a cool space - low lighting, booth seating, swanky feel.   I recently did a girl's dinner here on a weeknight. When we arrived at 6 pm, we were some of the first guests of the evening.  We ordered apps and drinks. The apps came out quickly - I'd recommend the charcuterie board. The drinks took FOREVER to arrive - greater than 20 minutes. We ordered entrees and these also took a really long time to come out, which we found odd as the restaurant was empty. I ordered a burger and it was good, but not great.   I feel this place is on the expensive side for what you get. With their prices I'd expect great service and food, but both have not met my expectations on my visits here.",

When my friends made reservations to go here while visiting I didn't have many expectations, but thinking pub style. It is anything but a pub!  It's underneath the main Duckworth's and the ambiance is definitely cellar with low lighting and small area for seating (that's why it's hard to get reservations - not a huge place).   The food was very good. Our party got 6 of the small plates to share and a few entrees. The shrimp and grits were on point. The duck flat bread was a bit gamey for my liking.   The part that was super impressive was the cellar area for their beers! I'm not a beer drinker (hubs is), but I was very impressed by their selection, the way they talked about their beers (I.e., limited edition, aged in __), and how organized and precision of stocking. Whoever keeps up that cellar needs to come organize my pantry!  Service was very warm, attentive, and professional. It definitely fits the Uptown scene and is a place for an intimate gathering.",

They are made with such care and detail.  The best cocktails I have ever had.  Very impressive.  The Spicy Smoked Peach margarita was amazing with the smokey salt around the rim, the jalapeno and the peach puree.  The Mai Tai was coconutty and creamy deliciousness.  The Vieux Carre was good.  The Smoked Pecan drink was so fun and yummy with the cinnamon smoke on top.  The Char-Grilled Oysters were so deliciously yummy.  The butter basted scallops were outstanding.  I am seriously craving both dishes just thinking about them.  We spent about $120 on what we considered drinks and appetizers but it was worth it!!",

Okay let start off with the negative....the location. To no fault of their own, this establishment is right in the midst of a pretty heavily homeless populated area. I only mention that because upon exiting, we were approached and asked for money....so just be prepared that more likely than not (at nighttime) that will be an experience entering and exiting this business.      Now for the ALL THE POSITIVES. I was super impressed with the ambiance, vibe, menu and service!! Special shout out to the bartender who took care of us (I think his name was Zack). Super knowledgeable about cocktails, smiled and was engaging throughout the night, made some awesome menu suggestions, crafted an exceptional cocktail for me, and was a little cutie (which definitely didn't hurt).  I'll definitely be back as a regular to this spot...hopefully Zack will be working!",

    "text": "What a neat place The Cellar is. As you descend down the steps in Duckworth's, you're transported from a deliberately raucous sports bar to a 1920s speakeasy with dim lights, exposed brick walls, and servers donning bow ties and suspenders. The staff greeted me with warm smiles and the service continued to exceed expectations with our waiter, Taylor (?), providing us with recommendations, educating our party about ingredients, and making sure our every need was met.  We ordered drinks first. My drink was a pear/peach (?) jalapeno number. It was small and underwhelming as it seemed they held back on the jalapeno. My friend ordered one with raisin vodka(?) because she likes raisins and while she thought the drink was fine, she was disappointed that she couldn't taste any raisin reference in the cocktail.   I was with a group of four and we shared Carmelized Brussels and Grilled oysters for our starters. The basalmic reduction drowned any carmelized flavor of the Brussels. What was good were the onions and prosciutto on the Brussels plate. I couldn't stop eating them.  The grilled oysters came out piping hot fresh off the grill. The starter came with 5 oysters, so you shouldn't order this if you plan on sharing OR just order two servings. The pecorino cheese, which is hard and has a salty element to it was a nice compliment. What I enjoyed most was dipping the bread in the oyster broth, in which was nestled a robust smokey flavor.  My main course, the shrimp and grits, while edible were a let down. The stone ground grits were acceptable, but lacked any cheddar flavor. The shrimp, individually, were well smoked. However, they missed the mark with the etouffee. There was too little of it, rendering the grits dry and was was there had a shallow taste at best and was disappointing. What makes shrimp and grits are the ingredients that collaborate with the shrimp and the grits. Here, they didn't work. After sampling my friend's scallops, I was terribly regretful that I didn't get those instead.  Post dinner, Charles - the manager, came out and greeted us personally, telling us about the concept development behind the  restaurant and a bit of a history lesson regarding prohibition and Charlotte. That was nice.  The price points here are reasonable, Shrimp & grits $15. Scallops $19. Drinks $10. See pictures for full menu.  Ambiance 5 stars, Service - 5 stars, Food 3 stars. Not taking averages because I'm here for the food. I'll give it another shot, but will be ordering either the scallops or trying a steak, as the waiter was enthusiastic about the state of the art broiler.",

We ordered a bottle of wine and asked for recommendations - she dashed off two - did offer us a taste of one, but we felt like she was very rushed and didn't really care what we ordered.

All of their drinks are made with fresh ingredients and worth the wait to watch them prepare each piece of the delicious cocktail. It's a tapas style restaurant too, so sharing is caring. My group had the truffle fries (a MUST have), truffle mac and cheese, and we each had a filet. The BEST filet I've ever had. We finished with the s'mores dessert - soooo good. Daron was the server and was truly a master of his craft. He was so personable and knowledgeable, I almost wished he joined our party at the table.

The cocktail folks are just as happy. You can't loose here.",

The Mac and cheese was so rich and tasty.",

While dining at 5 pm and only 2 other people were dining as well.  Tapas to me is small plates and yes brought out at different times not dinner...While wanting to try this venue, it was just ok not sure what all they hype is about.  I was disappointed to have to eat alone(:, it is just weird that dinner is not served at the same time....enough said",

I would like to give this review a 4 instead of a 5 but that Mac 'N Cheese takes it to the next level. It's worth every carb; every intolerance. They have a smoked peach margarita which was incredible but ask for it without the artificial smoke (it's smokey enough without it). The decor and ambiance is excellent. Our server really knew her stuff. The  tacos and candied bacon were tasty. I also liked the brussel sprouts. Dislikes: They lie about their availability. The hostesses intentionally hide the dining room and tell people it's a 45 minute wait with 10+ tables being open. The burger lacked flavor and I  found the s'mores underwhelming.",

Food wise: we had the duck flatbread which was tasty! We also had the lamb dumplings that I enjoyed much more than I expected. The portions are good sized.  The price isn't cheap but you're paying for the ambiance as well. We walked into the restaurant and had to go down the stairs to the cellar. It's all brick and dimly lit. Just a great atmosphere.",

    "text": "The Cellar   Food 4.25 Value 4 Service 4 Decor 4   This was my 2nd time here and it did not disappoint. My 2 friends and I ordered 6 appetizers which was way too much food:  Appetizers-    - Truffle mac and cheese - TOO DIE FOR. SO CREAMYYYYYYYY! I had high expectations for this and it far exceeded it. Hand down best dish of the night.  The bits of bacon were a nice touch.   - Caramelized brussels sprouts - also amazing!!! Pro tip- eat the brussels sprouts with the mac and cheese. Game changer, I'm telling ya.   - Lamb gyoza- nothing too special but the lamb tasted very fresh   - Charcuterie + cheese - is it weird that the honey accoutrement was my favorite item on the board? Well, it was. And I would eat spoonfulls of that honey. The cheddar + gouda are fantastic.   - Corn Risotto - risotto was a tad overcooked. By the time we started eating this, we were SO full.   - Duck flatbread - visually looked beautiful. I was so full when I took a bite of this. It was a flavor blast but not in the best way. The balsamic was a bit overpowering. Probably would not order again.   Cocktails- had the french buck and moscow mule. Moscow mule was fantastic but the french buck was way too gingery. I've had their other cocktails in the past and all were great and you can tell are made with so much love.    This place is great for happy hour, catching up with friends, or date night-- it would make for a super romantic date!",

    "text": "For the amount of money it was definitely not worth it. I am very disappointed especially for the upscale standard they try to uphold. I was really excited to try this restaurant after reading reviews, but I'm highly disappointed. It's under the bar and grill down some steps. My first thought was \"sheesh this floor is beyond slippery.\" Wait wasn't bad took about 10 minutes to get seated at the bar, which was very cramped. The seats were shoulder to shoulder and with it being a tapas style restaurant it was inconvenient. Decor was dark and rustic the vibes were good.   Let's get to the good stuff...  Menu has a variety of different options they're all shareable plates. The drink menu was on an iPad, I tried they're Mojito and I wasn't impressed it was very basic. The portions were off and for $14 I've had better for half the price.  To start off we ordered the truffle fries, oysters, lamb gyoza and chicken sriracha waffle cones.   First of all, they brought out the chicken waffle cones about 5 minutes after we ordered. Which we thought was pretty impressive until my spouse had a bite and almost spit it out. So I took a bite and it was COLD and SOGGY. For the tier of restaurant I considered this place that was beyond unacceptable. It was a big no for us from there. They took the plate and we didn't bother getting another one.   Truffle fries were amazing, probably the best thing they have going for them.   Oysters were okay... there was too much going on it took away from the flavor of the oyster.   Lamb gyoza was boiled and bit pan seared. Wish they would've put that on the menu so we know what type we are getting.",

The atmosphere is great, downstairs in theBasement of Duckworth's.The cellar part is pretty awesome stocked full with plenty of great drinks. It's very large and you can walk in to choose a drink if you don't want what's on tap.   I ordered the candied bacon and the pork buns. The bacon was fabulous. It had a spicy jalapeno kick as well. Very delicious and crispy. The pork buns were not my favorite. They had little to no flavor. The buns were good and the pickled veggies on top were good. The pork was plain and very, very bland. Definitely missing something.   I would love to return and try more food and specialty cocktails. The serviec at the bwas  good.",

No one would answer the phone so I finally left a message. A couple of days passed with no reply so I called back in the evening. Someone answered and said they were unable to take the reservation because they didn't have access to the calendar or system they use for such. She took my info and said someone would call back the next day to confirm. No one ever did. As this was my first choice to celebrate my birthday, I was very disappointed in the service.",

My husband and I wanted to stop in for a few drinks and a few shareables before a concert at the Filmore and this was the perfect place. The cocktails are all crafted to an art with speciality spirits - no flavored vodkas or Tito's at this joint. I don't even want to list what we had because everything you try will be amazing. Listener to the server and follow your appetite- you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "Talk about a great spot within another restaurant. A dream within a dream... I stopped by The Cellar at Duckworth's after a hotel staff recommendation at a later hour because of work travel. First note is they are open until midnight which is key for those who travel on business! The venue is located down the stairs at Duckworth's, which is a normal bar/restaurant upstairs but the downstairs is more of a speakeasy/intimate/quiet spot with dim lighting, fantastic cocktails and great service. Needless to say that it wasn't busy which was a shock to me, but I didn't mind.   My waiter, Cameron, greeted me well and explained some of the cool history of the venue itself and their pride in craft cocktails. I was planning to stick with scotch, but I was convinced and went with a mezcal drink that was amazing. Not sweet, nice and smokey as if it was a cross between a sazerac and scotch neat. To go with my first cocktail, I had the bacon small plate, which is nicely baked bacon in a jalapeno honey that just made me want more and more. I definitely had to add the tuna tartare since it's one of my favorite things anywhere.   Once I got to the main course, I opted for the lamb chops. Nicely cooked to a medium, they were 3 good pieces that didn't overwhelm but hit the spot. I may have wanted to remove some more of the membrane while butchering the meat, but I still very much enjoyed it. It is served with a small arugula salad that breaks up the meat and adds a little freshness. I paired this one of their glass serving syrahs on the wine list. I may have opted for a Pinot Noir if I tried this again.   Be sure to check this place out if you're in town, or if you're a local. The seasonal selection of dishes gives me more excitement to see things change over time and not a boring menu.",

The steak is one of the best, if not the best in Charlotte that I've had and the small plates were also delicious, especially the oysters. The cocktail menu is second to none in the 704 but the obscure beers on the beer list are perfect for someone wanting to try something you'll likely not find anywhere else in town.

Our server was very informative of everything on the menu (I like to ask questions to see how much they pay attention to the chef before service starts) - he was awesome.   I even noticed the server at the table next to us, inform the table they were out of tilefish, but were offering grouper as a sub - that was very impressive! Most restaurants would try and pass off the sub without telling the guest - that was a big point for me! We started with the charcuterie and cheese plate - phenomenal! The house made beer mustard - THAT needs to be bottled! We split the tuna tartare - great portion size for the price and flavor was spot on. By the time we got our entrees, I was already getting full, I managed to save a few bites for my awesome shrimp and grits. He had the burger (rare) and loved every bite!  This is not a place to go for \"happy hour\" beers - this is a intimate place for a great date night, bringing clients from work, or just to come after a long day for a fantastic cocktail that is well worth the wait!",

When you head downstairs from the sports bar and tap house that is Duckworths you pass through a time warp that takes you back to a time when a secret password allowed you to enter into a place of soft jazz, great food and expertly crafted cocktails. The cellar offers everything you could want and more. I have found myself returning time and again and have tried almost the entire menu without dissapointment. The morning flip is my cocktail of choice, a creamy finish that pairs perfectly with the indulgent layered chocolate tort. If you're unlike me and would prefer to start the night with a meal and not desert, I highly recommend the lamb carpaccio or the succulent butter basted scallops. To be honest just enter The Cellar and be prepared to try it all, it's an experience you will not forget.",

I had a gin mojito with Uncle Vals gin, it was so good.  Everyone behind the bar was so friendly.  Then a table opened up in Darren's section.  We had had him before as our waiter.  He is good!

It's small, we sat at the bar and I personally think that was the best decision.  I loved talking to the bartenders and watching them make these exotic drinks.  I had the grouper, rice and artichoke with carrots.  Best grouper ever.  I had the smoked spicy peach margarita, which was delicious.

I love the atmosphere; low lighting, it has a lounge feel to it. Our server, Darren, was knowledgable, attentive, and charismatic. We ordered our drinks: Smoked Whiskey Sour and Redrum. Both were delicious (and strong). The flavors blended perfectly and presentation was nice too. For starters, we ordered the Truffle Fries. Those were good, but what kicked them up a notch was the malt vinegar aioli. It just slapped my mouth with flavor . For our entrees, we ordered the 8 oz. filet mignon (medium) and the 14 oz. ribeye(medium) O.M.G. I wanted to cry. It was glorious, oh so glorious. Tender, juicy, melt in your mouth. For our sides, we chose the Truffle Mac & Cheese and the Caramelized Brussel Sprouts. Flavor explosions and fireworks  At this point my eyes were rolling back. I chose to eat slower than usual to be able to savor each and every bite. When we finished, we were full but we caught site of the desserts. We chose the Corn Flake Crusted French Toast. I just about fell off of that high top chair when I tried the first bite. Crunchy, sweet, decadent. The manager also passed by our table to make sure that we were enjoying our meal and that the service was good.

    "text": "I went to The Cellar on Wednesday night, with a companion, to have dinner at the bar.  When I took a seat at the bar, the bartender asked if we had checked in at the hostess desk; stating that the bar was reserved seating only. I checked in at the hostess desk. One other couple was waiting and both of our parties were told there was a 30 minute wait. At that  time, half of the tables were open and the bar had 7 open seats. My guest and I choose not to stay. We walked down the street to a competing restaurant.  I live Uptown and have attempted to dine here on three other occasions.  I had a great experience twice but had a similar experience to Wednesday night, on a third occasion. On that third occasion, I did wait the 30 minutes, even though the restaurant had plenty of open tables. Interestingly, the restaurant had multiple open tables during my entire stay. I do not understand the financial model The Cellar operates under.  If low profitability is their goal, they should have no difficulty achieving this. Turning away paying customers when the restaurants has no seating capacity constraints is an odd way to run a business. With all the dining options Uptown, I doubt I will return to The Cellar.",

    "text": "The Cellar at Duckworth's is the bees knees! The cats pajamas! The bomb diggity and all that jazz. The dimly lit underground space makes you feel like you're part of some kind of exclusive dinner club in the 1920's. Except there are iPad menus, so you know it's modern day.   My husband and I started off with a flight of Founder's Kentucky Breakfast Stout ranging from years 2013 to 2016. It's amazing how different each stout tasted from year to year. All delicious! All distinct! And such a fun concept.   I also got a blackberry mescal which was a play on a Moscow Mule. There was some lovely smokiness to this drink (this place is known for their smoked cocktails- try one!)  Honestly, we were pretty tipsy by the time we decided on food. So we ordered SO MUCH FOOD. Too much food, almost...  HOUSE MADE WAFFLE CONES: 3 cones stuffed with 1. ponzu poke tuna, 2. coconut shrimp, and 3. sriracha honey chicken ($15). These handheld treats were so fun and so good. My favorite was the coconut shrimp, but they were all yummy.   HAND CUT TRUFFLE FRIES: made with parsley, parmesan and with a side malt vinegar aioli ($9). The malt vinegar aioli was out of this world. Why isn't this more of a \"thing\"?! It's genius!   SAFFRON FETTUCCINE: with charred octopus, bbq fig sauce, arugula, and a country olive reduction. ($15). I was a little taken aback when I saw an in-tact octopus tentacle on my plate, but alcohol makes me brave. This was an absolutely delicious dish. The octopus was cooked perfectly and the hand-made fettuccine was some of the best I ever tasted. The BBQ fig sauce added the perfect touch of sweetness. The olive flavor was fairly prominent, so maybe skip this if you don't like olives.   PASTRAMI MARINATED HANGER STEAK: with  chimichurri and polenta frites. ($19). My husband really enjoyed this. I snuck a couple bites and the meat was flavorful and tender.  I have to gush about the attentive, knowledgeable and kind service we received all night. Our waiter was more than willing to hear our preferences and offer suggestions. He even suggested some places to check out in Charleston once he found out that's where we were heading. We also got to meet and chat with the GM. He brought us on a tour of the beer cellar where we were able to marvel at the extensive beer selection. What a great guy!   Next time we're in Charlotte, we'll be back to visit.",

The truffle mac was creamy and flavorful. The pancetta pieces added a nice smokey flavor and the gouda was a delightful addition to the dish. I would definitely order this again!  The scallops were seasoned & cooked perfectly. The dish was accompanied with currents, cauliflower and chorizo. The chorizo disturbed the flavor of the dish, in my opinion. I felt like it took away from the the scallops. By itself, the chorizo was tasty...just not together.  I paired it with a Queen Charlotte mojito, which wasn't light on the rum (Amen).",

It's actually in the cellar of the Uptown Duckworth's but the atmosphere is so different than upstairs. It's like a speakeasy. They even have the door closed to make it seem all hush hush.  Inside this part of the restaurant, it's quite dark. It looks fancy but most of their customers were in shorts when I was here so don't think you have to come here in a suit and tie.   Just like upstairs, the beer menu is on an Ipad which make it easier to read. They also have a cellar of the limited release bottles and you have to ask permission to go in as there needs to be a staff member with you. There are first release Wicked Weed beers, Allagash, Dragon's Milk and so many more.  The only problem is that many of these beers you have to drink onsite.   Food is quite different here than upstairs with a more upscale menu. I had the Tilefish which was delicious and also ordered a salmon flatbread which arrived cold. The manager explained this is how it is supposed to be served but it would have been nice to see that mentioned on the menu. If I had read that, it would not have been ordered.  The staff was great here. So much different than some of my experiences at another Duckworth's.   Overall a very good experience. My only complaints were the lighting which was a little too dark and the menu item not listed as cold. But those aren't enough to stop me from coming for the beer!",

A year ago, during my first trip to Charlotte I met a couple in a bar that told me I had to check out The Cellar at Duckworth's. This is quite possibly my favorite bar I've been to while on the road. The food is outstanding and the drinks are top notch. I'm a huge fan of their lemon risotto. I've had a good handful of their drinks but the cocktail menu seems to grow with each visit. I brought two of my friends, also from out of town, and they LOVED it. The bartender, Cameron, was amazing. He took the time at the end of the night to show me and my friends, as well as two other gentlemen, the beer cellar with some of the most selective and rare beers around. It was so awesome to learn more about this place. I highly recommend you check this place out, you won't be disappointed. Thank you Cameron, I know I'll be back whenever I'm in town!",

I ordered the \"where is the smoke\" and I have been dreaming of it since we left.  The cocktails are handcrafted and they satisfy everything you would desire from a \"mixologist! Food? Nah!  My husband and I ordered the Brussels sprouts (they were yummy and roasted, but the balsamic glaze was quite literally a raw balsamic vinegar on the plate), the cone trip ( not even a little worth it as they are all filled with fairly dried out meat and the cone is the dominant flavor- Dave did warn us!), and the Mac & Cheese ( now THIS was delicious! the truffle flavor was on point, the portion size was fulfilling and the cheese was super creamy and savory).  I would definitely return and try again, just would be super weary about spending a ton of money here knowing what I may not be satisfied with. PS- the atmosphere is perfect for a date night!",

Then I tried one and I consider The Cellar the best steakhouse around now.",

My only recommendation is to have more gluten free options on your menu, but they were very accommodating about finding some choices. Will defiantly be back!",

We both agree the food is really good (Waffle Cone, Tuna Tartare, Shrimp & Grits, Grouper (recently), Brussels Sprouts, Scallops and Filet Mignon but the order the food comes out of the kitchen is annoying.  I can understand the idea behind the Tapas (family style) but having the two main dishes come out 5 mins after each other and finally the side dish arriving 10 mins later is really not appealing.  The craft made drinks are good but overpriced but they do have a good selection of beers.   The other problem once you receive your first drink, you had better order the next one because it's going to be a long wait in-between.  Service has always been good since not the fault of the server in how the kitchen operates.  In addition, expect to spend 2 hours here because if you have a show to attend at the Blumenthal most likely you will be late getting there.  Noise level is really loud so not sure, how anyone could consider it romantic if you have to shout to be heard.    I saw in some of the reviews in Yelp the manager came over but in the 6 times this past year when we have gone never saw a manager or heard of one!",

Walking down a stairwell in the Uptown Duckworths leads you to this cool door that opens up to The Cellar. The food, cocktails and decor are totally different than what you get at Duckworths. On my first visit I shared Brussels sprouts and oysters as an app, chose scallops for my entree. For cocktails I had a Blackberry Julep which I felt was worth the price given how strong it was. The scallops were done with a unique garnish of chorizo and currant ...and I loved it.On my second visit I split the truffle Mac N cheese, taco trio and salmon flatbread with a friend. The truffle Mac doesn't disappoint, and the highlight of the taco trio is the braised pork belly taco which makes me wish they let you choose the taco type (the other two - chicken and octopus I thought were just ok) . The salmon flatbread was ok, but not terrible. The highlight of the second visit was the Cellar Smash. I like Moscow mules so enjoyed the ginger flavor infused in the drink.  While the place may be a bit higher than your average happy hour ( they do not do specials) I think it's a nice treat or break from the average beer/ wine and standard bar dishes you get from a typical happy hour. This would also make a nice date spot or place to meet a group of friends for something a little different.    On both visits the manager Charles came out to talk with me and my friends which was a nice personal touch.",

Yes, it takes 15 min to get a drink... and if you would rather have it in 5, you probably should go upstairs, where they serve house liquor with a splash of \"random\" from the soda hoes))))  The space is small, on the darker side, and reminds me of old European bars. There is only a limited number is seats available at the bar-meaning it will never get overly crowded. Watching bartenders make the drinks is an experience in itself-they take the art of mixology to the next level. And once you have the Moscow Mule or Asian Pear at the Cellar.... you will find, that other places can only serve you the \"second best\".  I have had a few dinners there as well. Enjoyable food, interesting flavor combinations, but I will not make it my \"destination\" restaurant for dinner.  It is all about the atmosphere and the drinks there.",

The polenta fries were delicious.  The service was a bit mechanical and feigned attentiveness. The server seemed inexperienced and the over-the-too concern was a bit too heavy.   Dessert, however, was a nightmare. The French toast was cold. I have no clue what happened to the bananas, but how did they get rubbery and sponge-like? How do you do poorly made French toast? Yuck.

However, once we asked about cocktails, the waitress opened up a bit more.  I loved the Cellar Smash!  After our cocktails we sat for dinner in a cozy corner of the dark restaurant.  Ben was our waiter and was absolutely friendly and professional!  He offered suggestions from the menu in which we ordered!  Started with the oysters in creole butter sauce!  AMAZING!  I could have drank a bowl of the creole sauce by itself!  And the grilled baguette was soft and chewy, not hard and difficult to eat like baguettes can often be!  I chose the tuna tartare for my entree (another suggestion from Ben) which was delicious!  I couldn't figure out the crunchy ingredient on the bottom and guessed it was jicama.  However, Ben said it was green apple!  Never would have put that with tuna but it was a great crunchy texture to the soft tuna!  My husband ordered the hamburger which got a thumbs up and we shared the brussels sprouts.  The brussels sprouts were on the sweet side due to the glaze.  Delicious but we prefer savory over sweet.  My husband was undecided upon a beer with dinner, so Ben organized a beer cellar tour with Charles while our meal was prepared!  He suggested the ideal beer to accompany his hamburger!  How neat is that!  Overall it was a wonderful evening full of yummy cocktails, delicious food and excellent service!  Although we don't eat out much (I love to cook!!), we will definitely be back again!",

    "text": "Unbelievably slow service. Mediocre and way overpriced food. Choice is good but having so many beers on tap that you have to scroll through an iPad for an hour to find something you want is lame.   A friend of mine from out of town was staying in a hotel downtown for a work conference and I met him at the cellar for dinner. I was embarrassed that this was his only impression of Charlotte.   We showed up at 7:45. The hostess told us we'd have a table in about 30 minutes. After waiting over an hour, I had to remind the hostess we were still waiting for a table even though more than 5 tables were open. By the time we finally sat down, the waitress had to explained somewhere around 82 cocktail specials before saying she'd take our order in a minute and disappeared for at least 15. We finally ordered food after 9pm. At 10:30 we had to ask the hostess where the food was. She brought out one side dish. We didn't get the rest of the meal until 11.   If it weren't for the good company and a decent sense of humor it would've been a miserable experience.   Never going back to the cellar. Terrible.",

Reservations are advised, naturally because I am not the only one who favors The Cellar. The atmosphere and ambiance is darker, modern, and gives off the perfect weekend vibe for a night out (however, I did have to sneak my phone out to read the vast cocktail list!). All of the dishes are hand crafted and served in really nice displays. Bar tenders and the wait staff are always friendly and they had great wine recommendations. I love going here on dates or with someone special as well because of the intimate feel.",

Brussels sprouts were delicious and I don't usually like them so that was a pleasant surprise. The candied jalapeno bacon was good, tuna tartar was amazing, and we really enjoyed it! Our pork steam buns were fantastic, truffle fries were good, pretty normal truffle fries.  The only thing we didn't really love was the corn flake crusted French toast. It wasn't necessarily bad, but the quality of everything else was so great we really anticipated it being better. We just didn't feel it was on par with everything else.

    "text": "Friday with zero reservations and the place was packed, no problem I'll grab a drink upstairs whilst waiting. I understand that Duckworth's upstairs is 'different' than the Cellar, but the service whilst waiting upstairs was awful. Literally had to flag down a waiter at the bar to get a drink menu, then again it was a struggle to get a waiter to bring the bill once the Cellar texted us. Kind of unacceptable when you have 5-6 staff members chatting at one end of the bar for almost 5 minutes, instead of checking in with customers. My friend physically had to wave them down, not cool.   Due to the lackadaisical service upstairs, it took us a few minutes to get downstairs and the hostess didn't seem pleased that we were 'tardy'. Not exactly how I want to start a dining experience in terms of negative body language and clear nonverbal cues she is perturbed. Lucky the bartender Dave was amazingly friendly and provided excellent service a welcome reprieve from the lackluster experience upstairs. The atmosphere as others has mentioned is cozy and perfect for a date night or work function. I wouldn't say it is a speak easy-esque establishment as others have stated, the vibe isn't intimate enough to describe it in that way. But it is definitely an upscale dining/drinking atmosphere which is a nice change of pace compared to many places in CLT.   Ordered the tuna tartare to start which was a tad bit on the salty side. The guacamole was teeming with too much salt, but the fish was fresh so overall it wasn't too bad. My friend ordered the Duck pasta dish which he seemed to enjoy, but I didn't particularly care of the heavy cream. My scallops were sweet and well cooked, but again the chorizo/corn mix was just way too salty.   After reading so many great reviews on Yelp for this place, I had high expectations for this establishment. Maybe we just got them on a bad night, but for the price point definitely expect food that is seasoned a bit more evenly and more welcoming service from the FOH.",

If need to rank them, the desert was the best and the triple cones was the worst.   Prob different than a lot of reviewers. While checking the reviews to order food, truffle fries were one of the top. However since we Came to visit charlottes from Chicago, food in Chicago was much better.  Truffle fries you can find in most dt restaurants in Chicago. This one here was just normal level.   The three cones were one the the top as well. However feel just so so. The tuna was the worst. You can't feel the tuna taste when eating with sweet cone.   Parfait was really nice. Yogurt and goat cheese with some nuts in side made it fresh and thick creamy. Nice home made dish.   Overall, you can't compare Charlottes food level with other big cities'. However this restaurant still serves the nice food in the city.",

My friends enjoyed the shrimp and grits and the charred brussel sprouts.  Both were delish, according to them.  Their signature cocktails, prohibition style were smooth and flavorful.

    "text": "OMG, where has this place been all my life? It's in uptown Charlotte and I cannot express to you all how awesome this place is. This is a mysterious gastropub beneath the sporty Duckworth taproom.  Go down the staircase and ask for Nickie, the best mixologist in all the land.  All of the drinks are hand crafted, shaken, and poured to perfection.  This speakeasy features premium beers in a cold cellar with options to buy a locker to hold these exclusive brews.  Some of them are even aged like fine wines and pack a punch and cost a pretty penny.    The smoked whisky sour, mezcal mule and the old fashioned were so delicious.  It takes about seven to ten minutes to craft all the drinks but each one has fresh ingredients and love infused.  You won't be disappointed!  The truffle Mac and cheese is LITERALLY THE BEST I've ever had in a restaurant.  It's so rich and hearty and may be shared.  The ribeye steak was yummy too.     Don't hesitate to try this sexy, smooth bar the next time you are out on the town!",

The place has a nice dark atmosphere and the patrons seemed to be having a good time.   Our Waiter was Marshal. Although clearly he was busy, he made it a point to make us feel comfortable as soon as we were seated.  Great server! Ask for him. He knows his stuff!  To start we had the pan seared oysters. Omg, get them!  I had the Pastrami fried Hangar Steak. The polenta was the best I've ever had and the steak was perfectly cooked (med rare).   She had the Tuna tartar as an entree. It was the best we've ever tasted. Melt in your mouth, sushi grade tuna. Mouth watering.   They have a funky cocktail menu and the drinks were strong yet delicious.   All in all, we HIGHLY recommend The Cellar",

I even asked for a vodka soda plus something that made it not taste like vodka and he made me a delicious and beautiful drink. He is very talented and really took our visit to the next level. I can't wait to come back and try the food, I've heard great things about the truffle fries. The vibes in here are fun and intimate, and they have the only beer cellar in Charlotte! Great for a date or just if you're feeling a fancy cocktail.",

This was no problem for us as we arrived at 5 when they opened, but I can easily see how people could get upset at not being able to be seated even though so many tables were left empty.   There is an extensive drink list that you can browse using their iPads, though most beers are by the bottle instead of on tap. Per the bartender, all ingredients used in drinks are made in house.   Food ordered:  - Caramelized Brussels - ORDER THIS. This was the best of dishes we ordered by far.  - House made waffle cones - To be honest, I was a bit underwhelmed. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't order again.  - Grilled shrimp & old mill cheddar oats - Similar situation here. Main reason for the disappointment? There were a total of 3 shrimp pieces in the dish and the sauce to grits ratio made the dish a bit too salty.   TLDR: I'd come for the drinks instead of the food.",

I also loved their limoncello mezcal cocktail that was served in the cutest flask. My friends and I split the truffle Mac and cheese, burger, Brussels, flatbread and truffle fries. Everything was delicious. There desserts were even better my fave being the s'mores w the homemade marshmallow. Such a fun place for dinner-great atmosphere, service, food and cocktails.

To add an additional comment, we forgot to get our receipt last night and we are on a business trip. We came back this afternoon and even though they aren't open til 5, they have another restaurant upstairs. We asked if there was any way they could get us a receipt when they opened and they said they could take care of it, so we left our phone number. While we were sitting there, our server Bobby had showed up to get his phone that he forgot. When we told him our dilemma, he told us he saved the receipt and brought it to us.

We sat at the bar and ordered from tablets that allowed us to star and compare different cocktails, their ingredients, and preparations. Bartenders, with care and flair, pounded ice, lit things on fire, poured flasks, and made phenomenally balanced concoctions.

Just be prepared to wait......for everything...  the service was excruciatingly sllloooowwww...  I get being busy, but if I'm a patron at a bar, especially on a night where the bar and restaurant are at 50% capacity, I feel I should at the very least be acknowledged and made to feel welcome.  As well, I would suggest to management to encourage staff NOT to walk between tables and the patrons at bar because there's a constant bumping of the bar chairs. Annoying to say the least.   Started with their smoked whisky sour. The art of the cocktail making for this drink is a sight to see.  If you're at the bar, order one...  you won't be disappointed. Try to sit by the short end of the bar by the pick up station. I wish they'd prepare this cocktail right in front of you but.....they don't.   Also had the charcuterie board, tacos and ribeye...  the charcuterie was great and the tacos solid except for the chicken which had little flavor and was mushy.  The ribeye had an excellent seasoned char and cooked to perfect temperature...  Overall the place was solid and I'd go back. Great place to take a date.",

Our server Darren was wonderful - knowledgeable, fun, helpful, and with a great memory (he got all of our names right after just telling him one time!).  Charles, the GM, gave us a tour of the beer cellar and it was impressive! He was also fantastically knowledgeable and we really enjoyed talking with him about beer.  The food was amazing as well!! We ordered several apps - my favorite was the Brussels sprouts! I had the hangar steak for my entree and O.M.G. it was delicious!!! I can't wait to return here to try more of the wonderful dishes and I know this restaurant is going to be successful!  Thanks, Duckworth's for making this such a special outing!",

We got cocktails, a cheese and meat plate, the burger, the ribeye, and the Mac and cheese, and everything we had was barely okay.  The cocktails were okay, but overpriced and nothing special.   I was expecting a really great meal, and neither of us liked anything we had. I don't have very high standards for food, I like almost everything, and I haven't had a meal that bad in a long time.

I believe they've only been open for less than a year so they may be still flying under the radar a bit. Food prices are very reasonable for the classy environment. The caramelized brussel sprouts and truffle fries were both under $10 and their 32 oz tomahawk bone in ribeye was big enough for two people and a solid price at $68. All the food was amazing and would have liked to try the house made waffle cones but the brussels paired better with the bone in ribeye. Everybody from the guys behind the bar to the restaurant manager were very warm and welcoming. I wasn't dressed formally enough compared to the other patrons in the restaurant, but it didn't feel uncomfortable at all. The burgers and black grouper entree looked really good and gives me a reason to come back next time I'm in town.",

For some reason my business associate and I were treated so poorly from the moment we walked in to have dinner at the bar by all three bartenders, one female with brown hair and a pony tail, Dave and mostly by one named Amanda who represented herself as a manager.  Amanda showed the worst, absolutely appalling, disrespectful behavior towards us. When I asked why she is treating us so rudely, she said   \"if we don't like the service that we are welcome to go post it all over Yelp and tell our friends\". I said, excuse me, I am trying to finish my dinner that I am paying for and that we did not need to be treated like that. She then told me if I didn't like the service I didn't have to be there. I told her great, I will make sure that I find the owners of this restaurant and let them know this is her attitude. She said good, go ahead.   The 3 bartenders mentioned above kept on with the harassment and started laughing at us and started imitating my conversation I had about being from California. I heard Dave the bartender repeating my conversations to them. They just sat there laughing and starring at us. At this point I was completely shaking, embarrassed and humiliated. I asked them to stop being so rude and let us at least finish our meals in peace. Amanda laughed in our face and walked off. I asked for our bill and let them know I was done being treated like that. I paid the bill and a couple minutes later Taylor, who seemed to be a manger came over and apologized for the issue with the brussel sprouts coming out late and that he would take them off of the bill. I told him I had already paid the bill and that I was leaving because we were being treated so poorly. Just then as he was apologizing to us Amanda walks over, patted him on the back and said again, \"Feel free to tell Yelp and your friends all about it, I don't care\". Taylor tried apologizing profusely and said that he couldn't believe she just did that in front of him and would have a conversation with her. I told Taylor that I have never been treated so poorly and that the business associate I was with had the same experience recently. He said that he would let the head manager know about the issue. At that point Dave, the bartender then tried to apologize because he saw what Amanda did. He then gave me her name. I told him he really should be careful how he and the others treat people. On the way out,  Amanda laughed at us, waved and said good-bye and good luck.   I saw Taylor at the front door and said to him that she was still continuing to harass us. Just then another couple was walking out of the restaurant and overheard us and said we just had the same experience. Such rude service.  This experience was absolutely horrific. It's such a shame because the food and the atmosphere were great!",

    "text": "An easy 10 out of 10.  We've been hoping a place like this would open in Charlotte and little did we know here it is right down the street in the cellar of Duckworth's.  The ambiance is dark and broody, but it's what you would expect (and want) for a pseudo prohibition style cocktail bar.  The attention to detail was impeccable.  Heavy wood, exposed brick walls, a full cocktail bar laden with blow torches and fresh plants for drinks.  Speaking of drinks...the drinks were incredible.  Handcrafted, spiced in house, blocked ice.... mmmm.  We both got the Eastfield or East Village (can't remember) cocktail.  It's their take on an Old Fashion with homemade spiced cherries and orange oils.  We got two each and didn't even bother to try anything else.  The food (I am smiling as I write this because I am so happy) is mouthwatering.  I can like a place just fine, but if their food is average I will probably not be back often.  Thankfully the Cellar's food is artistic cuisine.  It's tapas style and every single bite we had was fresh and bright, full of flavor.   We started with the truffle mac and cheese (don't even.... oh my... stop) and the caramelized Brussels sprouts.  Then we had the charred romaine and the tacos.  Seriously, every bite was better than the last.  Even the things we weren't expecting much out of were bursting with flavor.  But the climax was the dessert.  The homemade, handcrafted almond s'mores.  Oh.  My.  God.  I'm not even sure I can try to describe this dessert in words that are not worthy of it's confectionary godliness.  You just really have to try it.    I think I'll make it my goal to try everything on the menu before Christmas.",

    "text": "Went here with my guy for our last date night and I have to say it was one of the best yet! We had been talking about going to try this place out for months but never made it in for one reason or another. We actually walked in and totally missed the sign to go downstairs ( I know its called \"the cellar\" AT duckworths but it had been a long day ok) and went straight to the bar that we saw to the right and ordered drinks without questioning our surroundings... like I said it had been a long day... once we realized our surroundings about 3 sips in we made our way downstairs and found a totally different atmosphere from the one above us. It was dimly lit and a small area with tables and a bar. It reminded me of something out of a movie it seemed like such a secret. We sat at the bar like normal and ordered a glass of wine and a beer and the bartender who was also named Lydia showed us a late night menu with options like charcuterie, hummus, tuna tartar and truffle fries. It was outstanding. Yes I was hungry but everything was amazing. I know this because my guy ordered the truffle fries and I. Hate. Truffle. Anything. With a passion. But not these I loved it all. The tuna tartar came with these light and crispy wonton chips and a side of house made guacamole. The hummus which I think was my favorite came with cucumber tomato and feta salad tossed in a vinaigrette and the charcuterie board had options for the normal cheeses and meats we went with a cheddar and gouda and a prosciutto and beef combo.  Now by the time we were done I think our final tab came to about $125 with tip for 4 small plates 2 glasses of wine and 1 beer which I suppose is a little higher than the average place but totally worth every penny. The food the service and the experience was amazing and I cannot wait to go back. Definitely a great spot for a late night date night.",

    "text": "Unbelievable...  1. In customer service the first answer that comes from a service mouth is NEVER no.  Don't get Shannon as your waiter.  I asked if they have avocado so I could possibly order as a side and Shannon's answer was NO.  They have guacamole but not avocado.  How about saying, I can definitely check and I will be right back, however the answer was NO. 2.  Irish mule?? Shannon's answer NO, it's not on the menu. 3.  We ordered a drink for a gentleman (it was his birthday)  who arrived with 8 guest who sat at a long high top table next to us.  We thought it was nice gesture.  Shannon then came back to my husband and asked what we ordered, my husband replied, then Shannon mimicked.   4.  Husband steak ordered NO pink, it came pink. 5.  General manager came to see how our night was going at the very end.  We explained being a business owner ourselves that customer service is #1.  As we continued into detailed he said he understood, he would have got me the avocado and the Irish mule.. But that was it.  As the last line of defense this manager did not save the game. LOST!  After more then 200.00 this guy didn't offer a thing.  No drink on us, no desert, nothing!  I was so perplexed.  Restaurant business is hard enough to service.  If you ever want to go here, ask for Taylor.  Hopefully he is the manager by the time you get there.  This guy is educated, well mannered and I know he would of handled this situating like a charm.  If there is one reason we would ever think of returning it would be because of Taylor on staff and a different manger working.  This was our  first visit.  We came here after visiting from Lake Norman, wanted to experience something different and followed reviews.   First impression, the cellar was a very cool atmosphere.  We would have loved to experience this place as a date night but it was a random stop by.  They have to fix this!",

    "text": "Fantastic cocktails, delectable small plates and romantic ambience make The Cellar a marvelous date night!  We tried a bunch of small plates and shared everything--1. Tacos--chicken, octopus, pork belly--w/ pork belly as my fave w/ smoky sweet meat. (We probably should have had 2 orders for 4 people.)  2. Waffle cones with chicken, tuna and shrimp--definitely my fave appetizer! Think sweet, umami flavors & presented in a little waffle cone rack. 3. Truffle fries because you can't go wrong, their dipping sauce is a balsamic aioli that's worth seconds. 4. Flatbread with salmon and capers, pear, marscapone flat bread-lite and savory. 5. Tuna tartare that melts in your mouth-- like sashimi cut tuna with the full fatty goodness making your tastebuds dance! Another favorite! The cocktails were impressive--tried the Blackberry Mezcal mule--intrigued by the smoky tequila & sweet berries. The dessert we all 4 shared was the CAMPFIRE ALMOND S'MORE-dragon's milk ganache, marshmallow puff, graham cracker. Definitely worth the calories & you need 4 people to demolish the rich ganache, made in house! I think they had good service especially considering how crowded the place was on a weekend. I feel like this is a much needed addition to the foodie scene. I will return to try the other plates!",

They have an actual cellar with a myriad of beers - many from wicked weed too. The overall experience was fantastic, the drinks were artisan and well crafted and the food exceeded all reasonable recommendation. 10/10 would recommend!",

I was looking for a speakeasy type place in Charlotte, and this hit the nail on the head - though it doesn't have the complete feel (reservations, go thru phone booth into bar, etc). My dad and I both got some drinks and an app. All was very good.   It's great to watch the bartenders craft the cocktails. They're also pretty knowledgeable on whisky and spirits.  Great craft beer selection as well.  definitely something worth trying (and trying, and trying).",

My personal favorite were the truffle fries, maybe just because I love fries, but nothing else really stood out that much.  I will say the waffle cones were different and interesting, but again, just ok for us.  Loved the ambiance.  Ordered a few different cocktails, which were good, but for the price, should of either been bigger....or packed more of a punch.",

    "text": "My gf and I went there for the first time last night. Everything was wonderful. Our server was Patrick and he was very knowledgeable about all aspects of the menu and the history of the building. We had no idea The it was the anniversary of the repeal of prohibition so it was definitely alive and bustling crowd. We started with some charcuterie and some tapas. Everything was amazing. Now I know that this place is founded on their wonderful mixology but this food is amazing. My gf wasn't loving the mojito so we stuck with some wine. By the way, that's just her I'm sure mojito drinkers would have enjoyed it, opinions vary Anyway, we moved onto our entrees and I went with the grouper while she went with the scallops. My grouper was just what I wanted. Not a lot of buttery sauce like most places. Just some delicious grilled fish. But her scallops, insane good. That touch of turmeric was amazing. Hands down, the best scallops I've had in quite a while. I can't suggest this place enough. They also have a beer cooler that will amaze. I didn't have an opportunity to go inside but there are tours and it gives us another surprise when we go back.",
