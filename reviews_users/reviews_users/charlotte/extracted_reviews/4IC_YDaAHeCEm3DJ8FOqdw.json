But that distinct seeded bun and weird sauce stuck with me. I can say for sure that was the worst cheeseburger I have ever had in my entire life. Yuck.",

    "text": "Red Robin. Yummm?? (Damn those are annoying commercials...) It's alright. For burgers that are unique and original I'd pick a different place. Some of their good points: they can boast of some great onion rings brought out in a towering stack, endless fries is always a selling point, burgers are sizable. However all that aside they're really just okay. Like I said, you can find more interesting burgers at plenty of other places. Their stuff is pretty standard. Grilled chicken sands, BLT burgers, Westerns with onion petals and BBQ sauce. You know, the usual. And the fact is, when you've eaten your fill on that burger and the first round of fries you really aren't going to want and additional servings of fries. Prices aren't bad though I think they've gone up a bit since my last visit long long ago. For location specifics I personally prefer the Red Robin further down WT Harris closer to the University area. Typically I'll go here because it's closer to home and I'm craving a change up. Also, the family tends to prefer knowing what it is they're gonna get when they place an order so we often end up at one of the chain wine/beer-n-dines.",

    "text": "As I mentioned earlier on Olive Garden, we didn't want to wait for at least 50 minutes to sit down then order and wait .... We decided to look for somewhere else close-by.  We were asked earlier by a lady where Red Robin, so we thought we could check that out.  Yes, we did.  OK, typical American food, burgers... The place looks amusement park, good, very lively, like a pub, we are very welcomed. Lots of families that means he price has to be affordable.  No waiting time.  We were hungry so we took it. Every American restaurant offers the same kind of menu... So needless to say.  Price is alright.  We had steak dips comes with side, but the extra side looks real small not same as the server said, I like sweet potato fries and wings, beer to chill down. When someone is hungry, we can shuffle down anything. The sweet potatoes fries were not burnt but kind of cold, I perferred not to complain as it might have been out of microwave warm up.  Unless they fry new sweet pototaes. The dip was good.  But the wings were dried.  I also saw that the celery was dried on the ends and the skin.  I told my friend I guess the chef must be American African.  He asked me why?  I said, I travel and I love cooking.  African love fry food but most of them over-cook and they are dried. American chef cook mostly frozen meat.  Asian cook fresh meat and always juicy (there's a secret to it).  So when we finished, I asked our server Turdy, a sweet young lady if the chef is American African, she said yes and asked how I could tell. I just told her about the food.  Anyway, the prices for other food were acceptable for the quality.... Since more families customers, their cleaners really have to stay on top of that, otherwise, it can easily spoil the image.  I like the place to come with children on regular basis.",

Ordered the Grilled Chicken salad avocado and my taste buds are dancing. So why not treat myself to something sweet ( Cheesecake strawberries) happy dance :)  Open my salad and the first thought was you have got to be kidding me.  Wilted lettuce, over ripped tomato, uncooked chicken with water down dressing.  Why would you allow this to leave your store and served to faithful customers. For the price I could have bought to Great tasting salads from Chick fil A but Noooooo I wanted the Big Red. Bigger Mistake !!! Just to make it worst I decided to eat the Cheesecake and guess what ?  Whoever cut the slice must have just chopped onions cause that is all I taste.  Simple things make greater impacts on your customers.

If once wasn't enough, we ordered dessert and that took a very, very long time to arrive and when it did, we didn't have spoons. We waited and waited for spoons, but they never came. Finally, my dad had to go to the kitchen to get us spoons and he was given a dirty one.  My parents have been to several Red Robins throughout the US and they told me this was their worst experience.

Your online prices are cheaper just an FYI!  The reason for 3 stars is because my burger was great! Soggy bun but thats expected with togo burgers,  your fries are always amazing, this time not so much and we actually ordered extra this time....yay.  They had NO seasoning on them what so ever and were soggy, they are usually so tasty. Your guacamole is great and the mac n cheese was wonderful.

When we asked our server for \"no bun\", she recommended \"protein style\" which basically means a lettuce wrap. Huzzah!!  I hadn't tasted a burger that was so juicy and filling and satisfying like that.  Since then, the meals are still been tasty; but the service has dropped a tad. Servers have to ask us what \"protein style\" means. We don't make a big deal of it, they want to know. Still, the food is brought out with salad wedges on either side of the burger so the meal presentation is lacking from before.  Also, we asked to be moved from our original booth that was not well lit. In fact, we counted six light bulbs that needed replacement on this last Saturday out.   I think we had been spoiled from the food and staff from a couple years ago which set such higher expectations for us. We'll still keep going here I'm sure, but what would have truly been a five-star two years ago fro this type of restaurant, is only just a three.",

    "text": "\"Gourmet burger\" is an oxymoron.  Put truffles on in, put caviar on it, it still is a hamburger,  Maybe there was a day when putting A.1. Peppercorm spread or chipotle aioli on a hamburger was enough to get attention, but today you can get an Angus Mushroom and Swiss burger at McDonald's.  Don't get  me wrong, I love a good hamburger as much as the next red-blooded American,   But on my first and last trip to a Red Robin, I found the \"gourmet burger\" pitch off-putting.  I made the mistake of ordering the Bleu Ribbon.  I mean, I love bleu cheese (they even spelled it right!) on a burger.  This, however, was overwhelmed with the steak sauce and chipotle aioli (no, the two do not go well together, in case you wondered).  In hindsight I wish I had ordered something that would have let me know whether they can properly prepare a hamburger.  I enjoyed Bad Daddy's Burger Bar much better, and think their menu is much more creative.  Red Robin is an attractive place, and our server was good.",

The meat is not particularly tasty anymore and the bottomless fries are now served in a literally bottomless cup which is more of a hassle than it's worth. So it goes, I suppose.  There were somethings that I made this particular visit sub-par though. The restaurant was absolutely freezing. Even after our food arrived we had to ask 2 different servers for utensils so that we could have napkins. Were either of these things disastrous? No. But they were unpleasant and when coupled with the prior comments about the  food were enough to make me think twice about coming back.",

The service was good and good consistently. We used to frequent this place on our trips to the mall. Now its almost never busy, the service is lack luster. The manager is typically seated somewhere in the lobby chatting it up with someone for the duration of our visit. The food comes out cold, even though they arent busy. The only reason i give it two stars is because the kids get free refills on thier macaroni and cheese, (one of very few restaurants that do that) and because i am actually a fan of this franchise ii still believe they can turn things around. But until I read that things have changed, we wont be going back anytime soon.  Oh, one other thing. The bottomless fries come out 8-10 fries at a time. We counted every time. Barely enough to cover the bottom of the basket. And you have to wait 10-15 minutes between refills, if you see your server that often. If you dont mind waiting, ask for the campfire mayo.. thats a nice freeby they will throw in if you ask for it.",

We wanted to grab a good burger in a fun place where our children could enjoy and we celebrate our child's birthday. WRONG! Arrived at 7:30pm after calling ahead to check their wait time (was told no wait).  We were seated fairly quickly. Manager finally came and took drink order. A party of 9 was seated after us and they had a waiter WAY before we did. Finally the manager returned to check on us and he had to take our order. Although our order was not complicated, when it arrived (over 30 minutes LATER) it was wrong for 2 of the 5 of us.  We were left without drink refills for over 20 minutes. Waiter appeared at the end of our dinner. THEN, we decided to use the restrooms before leaving. OH BROTHER! It was like an ice skating rink trying to get myself and my children to the bathroom. My one daughter was on crutches and could not even get back there. The bathrooms were DISGUSTING. Only 1 stalk had toilet paper and 2 of the 5 (I think 5, or 6) had disgusting toilets.  I will NOT EVER go back to this one. We didn't even stay for a birthday dessert which was our original plan. Also, from my seat, I could see partially into the kitchen which was NASTY!!!!",

Asked to talk to the manager about the fish nugget.....still waiting....its been 15 minutes...he's coming now.   \"What seems to be the issue?\"  Really? Now were having issues? How about, \"How may I help you?\" OMG! He did not let us explain. He kept talking over. He needs to learn how to talk to guests with some humility, and quit the arrogant self important attitude.

    "text": "Let me preface with I have never had a Corporate chain type place move so quickly on service. I mean, make your head spin, kind of fast and sincerely. As much as I love Ruth Chris - even they have never proactively read a Yelp review and got into action (well, at least not with me).   Here's the deal: 1) If you're here ask for NATASHA. She is petite with a really long braid (her hair is super thick).   She is courtesy, great timing, helpful and impressed me.   2) The management team can be acknowledged. Although no one caught our issue the day of service and I didn't have time to talk it over while at the restaurant. I will say, \"Color me impressed\" that someone on the team read a Yelp review and got into action. I think it's always commendable to take the review as a way to improve or keep up the good work.   Well, this update is a KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!   3) GM Pete called to get info and he wasn't overly apologetic nor did he come off as insincere or with a lot of excuses. Nope he was paced at a good level of apathy and We would like to get it right. I RESPECT THAT.   In short, you may think of RR as a burger and fry type place that is corporate and standard. But I will admit that, in our experience from Wisconsin to CLT, RR has been anything but. Temp of the food is always just right. The offerings and portions are as expected. I am not a tavern burger fan because the patties just seem to McDonald's-ish thin yet all things considered (a) great service and (b) fries make me a loyalist.   The drink options (non-ilquor) are always an added bonus from Freckled Lemonade to the new Berry Peach thingy.   They have an outdoor patio.",

When I come here, it's usually around lunchtime on a weekday and I find myself constantly amazed that they stay open because it's rarely very busy.  They must do a brisk dinner business to keep up.  I find their burgers to be thick, juicy with a good beefy flavor and consistently cooked to the temp I ask for.

First, our waitress took awhile to come to our table just to take our drink order. When we officially got our drink order, not all the drinks were brought out and she clearly didn't listen to what we wanted.  2nd: I ordered the whiskey river BBQ chicken wrap, got it cold and with no BBQ. The salad I ordered was Caesar and I'm honestly not even sure what the heck was on if.  3rd: I did eat half the wrap bc I was honestly sick of waiting on my food the first time (that was brought out cold) but I explained to her that she brought me out a wrap that had no BBQ IN it. All she said was, 'oh, want me to bring you out a side of BBQ?!' .. Ah no, I wanted it in the actual wrap, that it was suppose to be in.  And last but not least, when I did tell her about the issue, NOTHING was done about it. She was a terrible waitress and the service was just as terrible.  We would not return to this location!   EDIT:  I would like to say that the manager at this establishment was awesome and why my stars were bumped up.  I feel sorry if her employees think it's okay to treat customers disrespectful because they don't agree with a review (or feel they should tell me how they thought it was, when that wasn't the case). The manager, joy, was very professional in how she handled the situation when she was on the phone with me.  I understand that it was very busy, it was a weekend where a lot of people had to evacuate their homes because of the hurricane so I appreciate her taking the time to speak with me (even if it was a couple weeks later bc she was unaware of what had happen).",

The Experience started off really well and then I received my salad and the lettuce was a little wilted, the burger was good my son's food was good. I ordered milkshakes to go one of them was the mint Brownie and the other was the cookie Shake. So, your first thought when you order both of those and is that brownie pieces will be in there and cookie pieces. The first time I receive my shake I received two cups filled a quarter or less than a quarter of the way with green water. I asked her what it was and she told me it was my milkshakes. I let her know that I did not order to quarter cups of shakes so she went to fix it and brought me a shake back told me to have a good day and walked away. But, the milkshake was extremely watery it was the texture of soda and they were clumps of melted ice cream throughout and at the bottom of the cup were little tiny black pellets that I'm assuming were brownie pieces! LOL Red Robin should definitely stick with their burgers and bottomless fries. I will stick with cookout for my shakes from now on. Overall the experience was decent.",

I love spicy food so I went with the Burnin Love burger with a veggie patty, hold the salsa and sauce. It was gorgeous to look at and pretty tasty but not mind blowing. I only ate half of it. Fries were good. I also had the nana nana moo moo shake...delish. My friend went with the wings...YUMMY! I ended up wishing I'd gotten that instead.

Upon walking in and waiting to be seated, a lady approached the hostess and told her that no one had come to service her since she had been sat down and could she please move to another table. Ut-Oh! I wasn't going to complain as soon as walking in and make a fuss about not sitting in that section that lady was complaining about so I just kept my fingers crossed.   Anyways, we were seated and quickly greeted by our server and were able to place our order pretty fast. I did ask for our fries while we waited and we received those pretty quickly.  However, I had asked for refill on fries 3 times and never, ever did I get a refill. It is not like they give you a lot anyways. It's a small handful - for the endless fries they should not be cheap and stingy. It is part of what they advertise and if it comes with my meal, I expect endless fries. Not 10 pieces. So that frustrating.   Overall, our food came fast and was decent. Upon eating my meal, I couldn't remember why I had once really liked eating at this place. It must just have been the memories associated with coming.",

Another customer went into the kitchen and found a waitress and asked her to get the hostess.  A few minutes later she appeared. The wait was not too long, but when we arrived at our table, it was filthy.  We cleaned it off with napkins.  All the condiments and salt,pepper and Red Robin seasoning were empty.  The Waitress eventually arrived at our table.  She was friendly.  She got both drink orders wrong.  The burger I ordered looked thrown together.  My fries were so over cooked they were like crackers.  They were reddish brown and crumbled when I bit into them.  Looking around the restaurant there actually were not too many people there eating.  It did not seem over run.  Other patrons were complaining their tables were filthy.  The guy behind me had some unidentifiable squishy thing at his feet.  The waitress would not touch it, and ran to the kitchen to tell someone to come clean it up. She yelled it loud enough for everyone in the restaurant to hear.  The manager seemed indifferent to complaints from customers, and appeared condescending to guests who had expressed concerns.  A good retraining is necessary, and maybe a surprise health inspection is due.",

Not nearly attentive enough. Fries were COLD on plate with a burger that was not hot either and a bun that seemed almost stale.  Never offered an additional serving of bottomless fries.  Needs a cleanup/makeover and better employee attitude/morale. Sadly, our last visit will be our last visit.",

The avocado was missing off my friend's the avocado salad, and when we mentioned it, the server did not bring it, even after mentioning it twice.  My burger order was just completely wrong, and I had to send back. It took a very long time to get the correct burger.

Toppings abounded and you could order just about anything if one of the many suggested burgers were not to your total liking.  We did the Nacho Crunch Tavern burger and the chophouse burger.  You have a large or regular burger option.  The large is half pound and the regular is quarter pound.  They were served in a basket.  The fries were not great. Way too salty and, frankly, nothing special.  You could get all-you-could-eat/endless fries, by the way.  But the burgers WERE very good.

The real reason I returned them because I asked the waitress were was the cheese she took a little finger and pointed in a dot of cheese on the corner of the plate.... that pretty much missed me off.

    "text": "This particular Red Robin the staff is just so wonderful, friendly and on top of their game! Obviously its known for its burgers and boy do they have a wild selection! All the burgers looked great! I am dieting so I went for the wedge burger its basically a burger with no bun and it was delicious had some guac on it to which added to the taste. If your not dieting or its a cheat day I would try the big burgers with the pretzel buns yum yums! All together the family and I had a great time and the bill was only $70 and we had 4 people and 1 child plus I had two coronas (I had no bun so I could enjoy a beer)! So I thought that was a pretty good price and the two people got desserts and an app. Will for sure be going back and they also have a red robin reward card which is great! who doesn't like rewards!!",

It was so slippery the patty actually shot off the burger with my first bite. It tasted like it was covered in horseradish not a blue cheese crumble in sight. I ordered it cooked still pink but it there wasn't an ounce of pink to be found. The fries were limp, tasteless and barely cooked.  It was a game of chance with the ketchup. I went to 7 tables before I hit the jackpot with a semi full ketchup bottle. Seriously!  You need it to choke down those fries. On a good note- the waitress was nice.",

    "text": "Well today I finally experienced how bad Red Robin is, I should have gone with my gut feeling, because it was as bad as I expected.   Walking in reminded me of a Denny's which gives you an idea of how bad the good will be. The service is mediocre and the servers are inexperienced. Being my first visit I ordered a Peppercorn Bacon Cheeseburger w/ their average fries. The server never asked me how I'd like my burger cooked so I assumed they cook them all the same temperature. Turns out she just forgot to ask me and took it upon herself to cook it well done which is NOT how I like my burgers. The so called peppercorn bacon was just plain ol bacon with the sprinkles of peppercorn. The overcooked burger was not impressive and neither were the bottomless fries which I didn't even finish.   The Fish & Chips according to my other half were good. I had a root beer which was 3$ and the strawberry lemonade almost 5$ (no alcohol)   Here's the best part! They have what looks like a iPad on every table with available options such as ordering appetizers, and playing trivia. Seems cool and it definitely distracts you from how slow their service is. When the bill arrived I was very amused at the \"ENTERTAINMENT FEE\" included in the bill for using this electronic device that's situated on every table. I did not notice any information regarding a fee for utilizing this device posted anywhere.   We spend almost 50$ for lunch for two with no alcoholic beverages! Ridiculous!",

But there is a huge variety of burgers and barbeque, chicken, even salads.    Our waitress was very outgoing. Her knowledge of the menu made our visit much easier and helped us to a better selection.      Angie loved the Southern Charm burger, brown sugar, sweet bacon and cheese!? Nice! The surprise was substituting mac and cheese for fries. The mac and cheese is phenomenal. I had the teriyaki chicken, it was good, but not my forever sandwich, will try something else next time. Angie liked the chili cheese fries we had as an appetizer, though really we had so much to eat, appetizer was an afterthought.      The chain has great selections, inviting dining room design, so...we will return!",

When we finally got our food, it wasn't correct but we ate it to avoid waiting any longer.   The family across from us finished eating as we arrived, and then we noticed they were waiting pretty much the entire time we were there... and for what? Dessert. Seems excessive.  The cook staff really needs to get their act together as well. We watched them as we ate and they messed around and acted like they had all the time in the world.

Doesn't encourage me to come back soon. Who am I kidding, I won't be back.  Well, I went back. It's gotten worse. 25 minutes til our drinks made it to table. After food came I had to get my own utensils and napkins. And as last visit, after a long wait, I had to ask someone else for French fry refill. Ugh. To cap off the night, had to get my own last beer after a wait to get Beer order then to get the beer from bar to table. Service is simply horrible.",

    "text": "Where to begin.... I came in with my brother in law and my niece and nephew slightly after 9pm.  I ordered the fish and chips, my bro in law had the bonsai burger, my nephew had the kids beef a roni,  and my niece had the kids cheeseburger.  Bro in law said the burger was just ok... nothing special.  Asked what could have been better, and he said it just wasn't satisfying.... kind of bland. My niece just nibbles, so no real review there.  Now the issues: - My fish and chips were overcooked in dirty oil.  I could taste the oil 30 minutes later on the back of my tongue after I was done eating.  There should be no after taste, and there definitely was.  This tells me that oil has had tons of stuff cooked in it and should have been changed. - My nephew needed a fork, so we asked the waiter for one, because unless he's going to shove his face into beef a roni, a fork is necessary.  The waiter came back with a spoon and said all of the forks are being washed now, and all they have are spoons.  A restaurant decides to wash EVERY fork during dinner service?!?   The table next to me ordered a salad and had no forks either!!!!   - Niece ordered orange slices and got fries.  Orange slices finally got to the table 10 mins into the meal. - I asked for more tartar sauce.  By the time it came out, I had finished my meal.  He still left it in front of me even though I had cleared my own trash and had it piled at the end of the table. - They advertise unlimited fries and drinks.  We got no refills of either. - When it was time to pay, the little machine on the table was out of receipt paper.  We hit the alert button to notify our waiter, but he never came around.  No receipt.  We finally just walked out.  I will never go back.  It was disgusting.   I could still taste the oil when I got home.  I had to brush my tongue to get it to finally stop.  I asked for a wifi password and was told they dont have wifi access.... probably so u have to use that pay-for-play table thing they have.   No thanks.  So, to paraphrase their jingle, \"Red Robin.......yuck\".",

The non working kiosk sitting on the small table took up valuable space.

No salt and pepper at the table so when I asked for them, I was brought salt & pepper mills.  Course ground is not preferrab!e for fries.  This may all be their way to save on labor prep costs, but if customers prefer to spend their money elsewhere because of it, just how much are they saving?  Left a bad taste in our mouth, we won't go back.  Sure they won't shut down because of it, but we are just saying how we felt.",
