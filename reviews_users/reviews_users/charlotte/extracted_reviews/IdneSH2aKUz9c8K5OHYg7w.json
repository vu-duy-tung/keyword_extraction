The Tega Cay location is closer to us and much more spacious. The pig wings are good and the pork belly is to die for! We also had them cater a large event and they were amazing! I received a large portion of pulled pork in the restaurant and was even able to take some home. The service, bartender and food were all really good in the restaurant and for the catered event.",

    "text": "I was conflicted about how many stars to give *this location*. I LOVE Dixie Pig barbecue. Both the Rock Hill location and this one have my favorite barbecue anywhere. BUT: This location is so... SO... loud. I went once shortly after it opened and although there were very few people in the restaurant, I could barely have a conversation with my fiance. They had music turned up SUPER loud and the acoustics combined with the obnoxious music just made it a less than enjoyable experience. I was excited that this location has so much more space but I cannot sit in this restaurant. I will be going back... but half of the experience for me is going *out*, sitting in a restaurant to get out of the house. So I will be getting takeout. I want to see if they make any attempts to keep the music down low consistently and get some panels or something to bring that awful noise level down. I will update this review if they do.",

The meat was tougher, I will visit in Rock Hill but not Tega Cay again.",

When we pulled up we looked at each other and said wow they are packed, but seeing as how this location is much larger we decided to see if we could get a seat.  Thy had a table for 6 ready, but unfortunately it was inside where they had a band playing.  My daughter had a bad headache and we asked for an outside table, at first they they thought it would be a 30 min wait, but to our surprise they were able to get us a table in a couple of minutes.  Our waiter David was incredible and was awesome getting our orders quickly and our drinks.  I highly recommend the onion dip and the jalapeno pimento cheese (this comes with fried pork skins which were still sizzling when it came out) Wow.  We ordered the French dip sandwich, ribs, the Paulie, pulled pork, and the smoked chicken!  All the dishes were perfect and delicious!Considering how packed the place was I thought our food came out quickly and there was no rush for us to hurry.  I can't thank the management for getting us a table quickly or him checking to make sure we were ok.  Yes I saw you making sure we were in good hands and I can't thank you enough for your thoughtfulness!  I can't wait for more family and friends to visit so we can bring them here!

The biggest drawback with this location, and this has been an issue with every restaurant in this same spot, the draft beer isn't cold enough, the make shift cooler is nothing more than a room with some window air conditioners, I don't know anyone who wants to spend $6-$8 on a great craft beer and have it come out just a bit cooler than room temp.

    "text": "THEME RESTAURANT: This is a tale of two BBQ joints in one Day: Gary's BBQ for lunch (adjacent review if you click my name or picture) in China Grove NC, and Dixie Pig in Tega Cay, just over the border in SC for dinner (this review).  First off, Dixie Pig is NOT a real BBQ joint: It's a theme restaurant masquerading as a BBQ joint, much like Olive Garden masquerading with an Italian theme. They serve only a partial menu of BBQ, missing such standbys as burnt ends, beef ribs, pulled chicken platters, or brisket sandwich... And brisket on Wednesdays ONLY!  The dining room is Dark and Very Noisy, though there was enough light over our table to read the menu, and it was clean.  Our waitress wasn't very friendly, she spoke fast and I couldn't understand her, even after telling her I'm hearing impaired three times, even though I pointed to my bright, big hearing aids.  I had the pulled pork platter with mac & cheese side. The pulled pork was dry & crunchy, which means it was WAY overcooked; and the mac & cheese was bland.  There were only four BBQ sauces:  * House, which was bland and not very savory. * Alabama white, which was just buttermilk, mayo, and vinegar -- Bland, runny, and hardly authentic (but surprised they even knew about it); * SC mustard; * NC vinegar  I'm giving this restaurant two stars, only because it looked clean; and the menu had some interesting items not expected at a BBQ restaurant. Otherwise, Find Another Restaurant if you like BBQ  My reviews of other BBQ joints:  * My review of Gary's BBQ <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_share/_f4rPxajlGIMVfMzMhQ4iw/review/Hdl-1rRJvpz2r4QptSHhCg\">yelp.com/biz_share/_f4rP...</a>  * My review of Whole Hog Cafe: <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_share/U4ALy9epZHEwFl3FnGun6w/review/eTaVCS7qm5VOUeN7KAWqhw\">yelp.com/biz_share/U4ALy...</a>  * My review of Smokey Barque near Chicago: <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz_share/4oP8BfE7RUmvxR2M0HxzFg/review/CapQ-9bvWgoYDjJsDuyoRw\">yelp.com/biz_share/4oP8B...</a>",

If they are serving it, definitely get the Peach Dumpling with Vanilla Ice Cream. Definitely a winner restaurant or take out place!",

    "text": "This review is based on two visits.  We first visited just a few days after opening and the experience was great.  Service was fast and attentive and the food came out quick and was worth coming back for.  I did note that they seemed overstaffed at the time and all the owners were  present and greeting guests. 5 star experience in this day.  Unfortunately our second visit could not have gone worse.  We waited at the host stand for nearly 5 mins while the hostess stayed on the phone taking to/go orders.  No other staff walking by took the initiative to greet us so we just had to wait.  When we were sat, our waitress again took over 5 mins to come to the table.  Drink order was placed and they arrived after a short wait, we put in our food order at 615pm.   I was telling my wife and our hungry 6yr old 'don't worry bbq places serve fast because most of it is already made and just needs to be plated up.' After 20 mins of waiting I was starting to get worried,  that's when I noticed other tables in the place didn't have food either.  I stated watching the kitchen door to see if anything was coming out- no food,  just some flustered looking waitresses.   By 640 we were ready to give up.  It took until 645 to find out waitress and officially throw in the towel.   No visit or acknowledgement by management, an apology was offered by the waitress on our way out the door. I felt sorry for the hungry masses that were just entering the place- good luck. This little piggy went home. 0 Star experience this day  Seems the luster has worn off and the owners have gone back to rock hill.  This is too big of a restaurant space to be successful without solid systems and procedures in place. It's hard to run such a big dining room and bar,  and they haven't even used the patio yet.  This is why other private concepts have not done well here.  Without help this place has little chance.  I am hoping they get it figured out before it succumbs to the fate of the previous.",

It came out as a BLT with a piece of cheese.  The other sandwich was a French dip.  Which I actually ordered a pork sandwich.  10 minutes later as I am eating it they brought out out pork sandwich.  The bartender told me items come out at different times for the group we were with.  I said I was just eating what they brought me.  She did not offer to get that sandwich for the person that I was eating.  I ended up paying for an extra sandwich for him.  She also could not get drink orders out timely I waited 15 minutes between trying to get refills on beers.  This service from her was terrible as she blamed me for all of it.",

I met 3 friends around 7p on a Tuesday night. It was packed outside on the deck, which want surprising considering the beautiful 70 degree night. The whole place was seat yourself and I counted 6 waiter/waitresses. I'd say it was staffed just right for the evening. We chose to sit at the bar area tables (high tops) and quite enjoyed Dax, our bartender/server. He was a nice, shoot it straight kind of guy.  We all ordered beverages and started out by sharing the french onion dip. The pita chips were fresh, flavorful, warm and served with a killer dip. The onion flavor wasn't too overpowering (Didn't linger all night) and the tang from the cream cheese seemed to pair perfectly.  Three of the four of us ordered the BBQ Plate with two sides. Two of us had the fries and mac n cheese, one had fries and baked beans. Two enjoyed the Memphis Magic sauce and the other devoured his Carolina Gold. The fourth in our party had the 1/2 chicken with potato salad and baked beans. He ordered the Alabama White sauce and practically licked the plate clean of it. Everything came out hot, delicious and perfectly seasoned. The meat was moist and tender, sides were fresh; really great spot!  All four entrees were proportioned perfectly and priced as expected for quality and quantity. Really can't complain! Plenty of floor space for a group or just a casual date.",

I had the Cajun shrimp appetizer it wasn't super spicy, it was good but I'd definitely try something else next time just because I think their menu won't have anything bad. The brisket sandwich was delicious, it's only offered on Thursday's if they have leftover brisket so I figured I had to try it while in town. I had it with cole slaw and the amazing  fried corn on the Cobb, and the black Betty for dessert- a great concept but not well executed.   I liked the smaller menu you could tell everything was fresh and it all was really very good. Only thing I'd say anything bad about was the dessert, it just wasn't what I expected and wasn't very \"fresh\" like everything else was.",

Last night we walked in and weren't even greeted. Took almost 10 minutes for waitress to come to our table, although she was friendly. Wings were soggy on the outside and dry and a chewy on the inside. Fried corn on the cob was gross too (and I LOVE corn). Frozen corn cob just sitting in oil. The mac & cheese was also gross, Plain, over cooked, flavorless noodles with clumps of greasy cheese. No sauce at all. When I had the French dip it was bathed in grease as well. I really want to like this place because it's close and they offer coupons, but the food just isn't good in my opinion. Good beer selection though.",

    "text": "The Dixie Pig is normally one of my favorite restaurants, but they were off their game today big time!  I ordered a pulled pork plate and the pork was \"mushy\". A very strange texture and watery. The Alabama white BBQ sauce was also a watery mess, definitely not the thicker creamy goodness I'm used to.  We then ordered two banana puddings to go, only to get home and find the containers half full and looking like it might have been left over from yesterday.  The vanilla wafers we're completely soggy and bananas  very dark Normally they have the best banana pudding I've ever had at a restaurant, and almost as good as my grandmother's use to be (which is saying a lot).  Everybody can have a bad day. Maybe their chef was out sick, who knows, but after so many wonderful experiences, I was truly disappointed today.  I hope they haven't made a change that reduces the quality permanently.",

Great flavor, very tender, crisp but still moist and they were just shy of \"fall off the bone\" so you could actually take a bite of them.  The collards with black-eyed peas were OUTSTANDING! Baked beans-very good, too.  My wife and I shared the banana pudding, again, OUTSTANDING!   Sorry we didn't take pics.   Service was prompt and very friendly.  Honestly, my only complaint is that they only serve brisket once a week, otherwise they'd be very close to 5-Stars.  We will be back often!",

The Memphis sauce was really good. They have eastern NC, mustard and white sauces. All were good.   Service:  Dan was very helpful and attentive. We were served pretty quickly. But keep in mind everything is homemade so during busy times service may be a bit slower. But is not a fast food joint. We went early on a Tuesday.

Service was casual and laid back (code for summer help that's working for gas money), but it worked for what we wanted.  My Big BLT delivered on flavor and the mac-n-cheese was more cheese than mac.  I liked it but I can understand if others would prefer a more balanced dish.  Cheesy.  Mmmm.  On this side of town, you might give it a whirl.  The one in Fort Mill, however, is worth the drive.",

Since moving to Steele creek I thought it would be easy to breeze in for lunch and out. I had a time restraint but still thought it was possible. However when I got there the restaurant was about half filled and there was only 1 waitress for the whole place. She announced it as another group walked in the door.   Needless to say we hadn't placed an order yet and didn't see our quick lunch being quick so we got up and left.   I really want to give them a try but this location was struggling today.

My go to meal is a 1/4 chicken with Alabama white sauce, black-eyed peas/collards and some type of other vegetable. I rotate between the white coleslaw, fried corn and braised cabbage. If I'm treating myself, I get the Mac and cheese. They have the best Mac. The black-eyed peas and collards are a must. They are savory, spicy and just enough vinegar. And the chicken is always tender and juicy. I would argue it's the best thing on the menu.   Service can be hit or miss. There's a man that works during lunch time that is really great. I wish I caught his name, but he's quick, friendly and always takes care of us. One weekday we came in and our server was also working the bar area. I saw other servers but they were also hanging around the bar. It was just hard to get their attention since the bar is in a different area and they were chit-chatting. So it's either been great or not so great.   Overall great barbeque!",

Nicely grilled with a sweetish Asian peanut sauce.  We also had the pulled pork and pork hash which were nicely smoked with crunchy outside meat and tender inside mixed in.  There are a choice of sauces, I went with Dixie Gold. Its a SC style mustard-based sauce, which has a little spice to it, and very little sweetness.  I really liked it.  The red slaw was also good as a side.  It had what seemed to be a red wine vinegar base, and had a kick that paired nicely with the pork.  We also had the pork hash, with the mustard sauce, ans which is served over rice is a good take on a South Carolina specialty.  I recommend this place, its one of the best I've tried on my visits to Fort Mill",

While the Rock Hill location is small and has a dearth of parking, this joint has it all.  Great parking, outdoor seating, room for the whole family, and a crazy big bar.   Speaking of bar, they have tons of awesome local craft beers from both Carolinas.  That alone will make me come back for more.    As far as food.  I love their plates and sandwiches just about as much as I love their sides.  Bbq Hash, red coleslaw, a baked #macncheese, and many many more.    The service was another feather in the cap here.  Cody was awesome and knew the menu like the back of his hand.  Great front man with some amazing marking skills there.    You can't beat either Dixie Pig location, but this one is a definate goto for anybody wanting to spread out and enjoy the experience.  #Kudos #PlacesWeLove",

This spot is a good size on the inside, and because of that it can be a bit loud due to the echo, but the staff does a great job of communicating despite that potential issue, the only thing to be aware of is that if you happen to hit it wrong, there could be a slight delay.  Not sure exactly what happened, as things were going swimmingly, and our apps came out just about immediately after we ordered them (including some freshly-popping pork rinds), but it took a really long time for the main dishes to be delivered. It's certainly possible that some larger parties slipped in while we were eating on our apps, but whatever it is, this was about the only downside.  The meal itself was tasty and there was plenty of food to go around.",

The corn is deep fried and my children would not touch it.  Overall the kids loved the pulled pork.  We had the garlic Parmesan wings and they were tasty; but, the Pork ribs were our favorite.",

I got them without sauce but I thought they would at least be seasoned....nope. The bathrooms where also GROSS!!!! It was a slow Sunday afternoon...can't blame the bar customers for that. Big fail on this visit! Not sure we will be back.",

    "text": "The food is usually good. Occasionally you will get some of the bbq that is a bit dry or feels as if it has been left out too long.  The salads are huge so be prepared when you order one. Other interesting items are he pig wings and the \"Paulie\".   I enjoy one of the wing sauces the most...monkey habanero. Unfortunately my wife wife only likes sweet bbq sauce and the only thing that is close is their Memphis  and she doesn't enjoy it.   The Mac n cheese is always on point and the pimento cheese with pork rinds is a solid app.   The best dessert we've had was the peanut butter pie and the banana pudding. Both were very good.   The only thing keeping them from 4 stars is the wait seems long almost days to receive food and sometimes it takes so long to get refills you'd rather them just let you get your own.",

It's new and big, it can fit the crowd which is really great. They absolutely needed this location, it came at the perfect time! The bar space is great, I can't wait to spend a few happy hours there. I'm happy to see that there have a nice outdoors area that's enclosed plus an open outdoor area. This spot is perfectly placed.   I must say it was nice to see some familiar faces from Rock Hill, the owner/chef was there as well as our very first waiter we had from Rock Hill. I'm sure they were helping run everything as smooth as possible. We will definitely be back here to try the new additions to the menu. I posted some pics of the menu so everyone can see!",

Stagnant beer selection, cig butts scattered all around the patio area, slow service, inconsistent food... this place needs a systems overhaul.   Outdoor bar area looks like a storage area for broken equipment. The barrel that they use for jenga has exposed nails sticking out of it.   Very weird... is anyone managing this place?",

You get massive portions for a good price and the food is amazing. I'm from Buffalo and this is the only place I will order chicken wings from outside of home. Their white slaw is addictive and the banana pudding is life changing - get it!!! The staff is awesome too, we love them all!",

I understand the desire to expand as a good thing but this new location has always had an identity crisis and a full bar that has \"regulars\"  hanging out getting sloshed . (Thats not so new) I,m not a fan of that.  How can I help with my review? - Good job on the BBQ sandwiches and hash. Great flavor! Personally I prefer having assorted sauces available on the table as opposed  to a la carte. -Always have a plan to greet customers upon entry even if it is pre-happy hour. We weren't. -Always have exceptional restrooms as their condition can indicate an all around attitude towards cleanliness. Just saying. I Will try a few more times as 521 bbq isn,t really that impressive. Good luck!",
