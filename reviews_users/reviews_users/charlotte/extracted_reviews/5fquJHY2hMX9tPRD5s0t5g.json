    "text": "Not sure why there aren't more 5 star reviews.  I thought the food was incredible--especially the fava bean frito (which is a \"du jour\" item so not sure if it will be available regularly, esp. since it's a seasonal dish).  Everything was flavorful and flavored well (I hate having to add salt to things, so getting that flavor balance right is key).  The mac and cheese was smoky and the addition of gruyere quite key.  The onion ring straws were fantastic/addictive.  The roast chicken was moist and delicious.  And the roasted beets were sweet and nutty and we ordered 2 dishes between 3 of us because we loved them so much.  My cousin and husband split a lemon tart that, initially, they thought they'd only take a bite of for something sweet at the end of the meal, but they ended up licking the plate clean.  Came here for dinner--had good service--maybe it's different at lunch but I really thought it was great.",

Since moving to Charlotte I've struggled to find good, simple, fresh food done well in uptown and Rooster's ended that search!   Everyone loved the food and all the efforts of the staff who took care of our large party of 10.  I don't normally like BBQ chicken but I LOVED it here in addition to the side of mushrooms and Mac & Cheese!  I will certainly be back!  Thanks Rooster's for helping make my 31st exceptional!",

    "text": "Went here with a few co-workers after a conference on the first night of Restaurant Week. We came in with six diners without a reservation around 6:00 and were told we could be seated but we'd have to be out of our booth by 8:00. I've never had a restaurant tell me that my booth was pre-reserved before but considering we were in a big leather booth near the window I guess it made sense. Unfortunately, when we were told that the RW menu had to be eaten by the whole table instead of just by the people who wanted it our numbers dropped to four as two people left to find more casual dining elsewhere. Rooster was worth sticking around for- I got to the RW in Providence and Boston every year and their menu knocked almost everything else I've eaten up north out of the water. I got the heirloom tomato salad, steak, and creme brulee and it was totally worth paying full price, never mind $30 total. Convenient location, incredible food and good service (except for our waitress forgetting to explain the RW stipulations before we ordered drinks which confused things a bit when folks tried to leave). Would definitely eat at Rooster again the next time I'm in Charlotte.",

Why so bad this time, not sure but service was horrible (yes, horrible)! Reservation at 7:45, sat down and order drinks, great they came fast. But this is where it went down hill and fast. Ordered two salads to accomplish our entrees/sides and waited over an hour for just one salad, the other never made it out. After almost 2 hours, our meals started to show up. Potatoes au gratin were great as the times we ordered before. The spiced chicken wings were not good but that's my take. Short rib felt rushed, fat still present even though slow cooked? Come on Roosters! The final straw were the onion rings, before were luscious thin fried battered onion rings and to my surprise the complete opposite; soggy thick onions that tasted like they were fired with calamari. Manager helped a little in our bad experience, but service this time generally killed the idea of ever going back. In the end, go if you want potatoes au gratin (the best so far in Charlotte) but stay away if you want great service on a Friday night! All in all, worse birthday dinner ever!",

Dessert was a pumpkin ice cream sandwich - described to us as \"thanksgiving in your mouth\" - and the coconut cake.  Both were good but the coconut cake was our favorite. Service was excellent.",

We sat upstairs at the open seating overlooking the kitchen and could not have been more perfectly situated. We had a superb view of the works of art coming out of the kitchen and of all the entire second floor dining area. It was perfect for us, as I was there with one of my best girlfriends, catching up while she visited NC for a conference. We ordered the Cheese, meats and olive tray that the waiter offered to put together for us, and he did flawlessly. It contained fabulous pickled cauliflower and out of this world mustard and bread to pair with the items- it was wonderful! For dinner, I had the Hanger Steak and she had the scallops; we paired with sides of spinach and OUT OF THIS WORLD MAC and CHEESE! I'm not exaggerating- this mac and cheese was literally the best I've ever had in my life. To die for! The wait staff, hostess, runners, bussers and kitchen staff were all friendly and engaging- we enjoyed how busy the hum of the restaurant was but it never affected our service and we will return when in Charlotte downtown.

Our waiter was overwhelmed, which is understandable if you have a good attitude about it. Instead, this guy chose to be rude. By the time our food came we still did not have napkins or silverware. I tried to flag the guy down, but he was \"busy\" so he kept walking back and forth past our table taking care of other things, carefully avoiding making eye contact. I finally asked another waitress for silverware, which she brought... without a napkin.  And also without silverware and a napkin for my wife.  After finally completing the protracted fork negotiation, we ate our competently prepared food.  When it was time for the check, the waiter dropped it on the table, literally without stopping or making eye contact. I've worked in restaurants and while I have a couple pet peeves I'm generally patient because I know how it is.  Just acknowledge it and apologize and I'm fine. This was really disappointing. There are plenty of other options. I won't be back.",

Imagine being seated in a place so dark, devoid of energy, compounded by drab music, that you lose your appetite. Good luck reading the small  font menu in  this light. As if the management doesn't really want you to be able to read the menu! I've been to funerals that were far more exciting!  The bread basket . . If you are going to serve complimentary bread, at least make sure that it's at room temperature if not warm. Our bread felt cold, gummy, and hence, wasteful.  We ordered French Onion Soup which was pretty good. Duck mouse, good texture but super chilled where it felt frozen and no seasoning. Polenta and Peas, mediocre. Polenta had soaked up a lot of flavored oil and tasted strange. Duck confit . . great dish if prepared our several hours where the meet and bones acquire the texture of a jam. Our order was prepared by someone who had never had the real duck confit. A leg quarter at KFC is far more tender than what we were served. Based upon the experience so far, we decided to cancel rest of the order and leave.  What's interesting is that almost all dishes were removed half eaten and yet, none of the waiters bothered to inquire why that was the case.  Bottom line . . Rooster has the potential to be far better if the management paid attention to quality control, actually tasted what it was serving, and ensured that customers left with a uniform experience.",

Our waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu items and she was very attentive to our table. Between the the 6 of us, we were all extremely satisfied with the food. I recommend the pan fried corn as one of your sides. The short ribs were amazing! Super tender and they are boneless, which is a plus. I also like the fact that a lot of their menu items are from local creamery and farms.   I will most definitely be back!",

Ordered a roasted tomato soup and was served a very rich and creamy tomato puree with salt enough to lower ones blood pressure level. Decided to let it slide and not complain, hoping for the mushroom flatbread to please my taste buds as well belly. Was disappointing to be served a very oily flatbread. One good thing about it was that the bread felt nice a fresh and was perfectly crisp, though that is hardly concession for serving a flatbread oozing oil / butter. I don't see what the hype is about.",

I was super excited to eat here, but after the first impressions, the food itself was just good, not great like many reviews say. My three word review would be \"TRYING TO HARD\" the Short Rib looked marvelous, but compared to what we had in Ireland (anyplace in Ireland) it wasn't close, but it did look marvelous. The Mac n Cheese was good, but again just not great.   The best thing at the table imo was my daughter's brisket burger that did taste really good. Everything else it just seemed like the chef said \"How can I make mine really different?\" and then applied that to every dish.   Looking forward to trying more restaurants during our week stay though!!",

They also have this roasted corn that was great too. Service was good, but overall severely over priced. $90 for two. We each ordered the rib, I had a glass of wine and my buddy just had water and no side to go with the rib. And yes 20% tip included in the $90.",

We were lucky to get it.  They were crowded and we lucked into a large table downstairs in the bar area.  We had everything from appetizers and salads to a burger, a pizza, and some really good entrees at our table.  I personally had the Beef Short Rib and it was spot on.  Great flavor and the glaze on it was exceptional.  I also tried a piece of my wife's Mushroom Pizza and it too was quite good.  Good beer selection and the drinks were good.  Drinks were a little pricey to me but I'm not familiar with the standard pricing and tax rates on alcohol there.   I enjoyed it and would certainly recommend and visit again.",

We were having a good time chatting about our background and getting to know each other outside of our office.   Waiter came back to get our lunch order and I asked couple of questions about Kale salad, he wasn't sure so I said I would like to order that salad if they can add black beans on top. He took everyone else's order and we were back to our discussion.   My order came in and he brought kale salad without the black beans, he left the salad on my spot and said we don't add black beans sorry!  Now, I didn't want to be a D**K but I thought I made it clear that I want to order Kale salad if they can add black beans as my protein portion which means my order was a conditional on \"if they add black beans\".   Even though this was corporate sponsored lunch, they gave us a table outside which means every single ladies went in and outside of that restaurant were checking us out. I don't want any lady checking me out while I am opening my mouth to take bite, that's gross.   I think the host and the wait staff could use a little training.",

The mushrooms are incredible and recommend them with confidence. I would not recommend the grits as I found them to be undercooked and a weird combination of bacon and corn (I know should have rocked). Everything else is really good, but if you are salt intolerant this is not the place for you. Good service but not great.....you can get ignored once waiter moves on so get everything you want when 1st ordering..... even a second beer can at times be difficult.

The second time I went was for another company dinner. I got the BBQ chicken, assorted mushrooms and the butter wilted spinach. Every dish was outstanding and the service was excellent as well. I was also able to try the mac & cheese, Au gratin potatoes, and the gnocchi duck sugo and really enjoyed all of them.

I went for the Carolina BBQ sandwich with slaw and pommes frittes, simply quite good.  My buddy enjoyed the turkey salad, and the other enjoyed his smallish pizzette/pizza.  The only one disappointed was one who ordered the chicken salad, which came out like a wedge salad (half a head of lettuce in the middle of the plate and smallish ingredients scattered on the edges).

It makes a very exciting atmosphere.  The booths are cozy and welcoming.      Great variety on the menu and huge wine list.  The fried oysters are the best I have ever had - light breading and smooth flavor.  I have had sandwiches here as well as the BBQ quarter chicken.  The BBQ sauce is homemade and very unique.  It is a thin sauce but exceptionally flavorful.  The portions are small but I think they are perfect for me - I hate taking leftovers home (especially if I am headed to a play at the Booth next.)

    "text": "A tremendous thank you to Rooster's staff for their assistance tonight. My boyfriend's blood sugar was crashing -- he was weak, nauseous & faint with a splitting headache -- after the 48 Hour Film Festival at Booth Theater. I left my boyfriend sitting in a chair on the sky bridge and dashed in to Roosters. I explained the situation to the hostess and asked for ANY food they had ready to go. The hostess went and got a waiter (I believe his name was Chad, I was a bit frantic) who packaged up mashed potatoes, butter beans and beets with to go forks. I rushed back to where my boyfriend was waiting. He ate slowly and within a few minutes started to come back around. I drove us home and he's now resting. We appreciate Rooster's kindness. My parents have dined in before attending a show at Blumenthal and loved it, and despite his poor state, my boyfriend commented that his mashed potatoes, butter beans & beats were \"so good.\" We'll be back sometime under less dire circumstances!",

    "text": "Horrible management. Bar manager is a moron and only carries beers from a few distributors locally which means customers only get a few seasonal options usually from the Budweiser group which makes trash.  The great thing for them is that the southpark patrons don't know their ass from a hole in the ground when it comes to beer options or good wine. This is a open air spot but all that means is that its loud because the owners were too cheap to build a wall and keep the food in the back until we order it. 15 bucks for chicken dishes and pork rinds as an app just shows how novel it is to mall shoppers to eat someplace that advertises as artisnal. Come on.  Grow up.  A fake southern twist on cheap food doesn't mean you can charge double the price. But in this place's case, it has worked for years. Sad.",

I had a bunch of sides -- beets with an unexpected bite; generous helping of fries; upscale corn; perfectly cooked asparagus. The wilted spinach was good but truly wilted - a little soupy.  Centrally located and close to everything.  Would be good for a light meal before the game or a casual dinner with a small or large group of friends. Enjoy!",

Waste of my time and money.  Also, it took our waitress 15 minutes to get us drinks and she didn't even think to apologize for the wait.....when you go out to eat you are paying for an experience, I have food at home I can cook, I got out to eat to be treated with outstanding service and amazing food.

The menu is so vague and full of itself, that the waiter had to give a monologue on what everything meant and what was missing/hard to understand. This was BEFORE we where asked about what drinks we wanted. Is this a tapas? Is this an entree w/ sides? What's the portion again - 1oz on this and 2oz on that? We were as confused about the menu as we were listening to the server give the 5 minute rundown on the what was really on the menu. The menu only has the name of the dish. No description of how prepared or anything. Our table was left shrugging shoulders and just hoped for the best. My past favorite, the Short Rib, was far different, and inferior, than it was a dozen visits before. :(  Lastly, they need to up their cocktail list for those who like to try new concoctions. What happened to your delicious Basil Cocktail? (brought over from Good Food).",

    "text": "So I had been in Charlotte for essentially a year for a project and working right near the epicenter. As part of my usual cadence of restaurants, rooster had ended up making its way into my dinner rotation. The spot has always been busy but relatively easy to grab a table. The joint has two floors with street level being a bar with a couple of high tables and the top floor being an open kitchen feel where folks are able to see the kitchen and a slew of tables. The decor is a bit rustic and there are rooster statues around to honor the name of the restaurant. The servers are always friendly and I was always greeted promptly at the door.   Over the many times I have been here, I have ordered a whole slew of items which included the wings, onion soup, charcuterie, hangar steak, short ribs, pork shoulder, mac and cheese, pan fried corn, spinach, and etc. The place is great to go with large groups or just small parties and as long as the person is a carnivore, this is definitely a place to check out. All the food I have had has been well cooked and tender. This joint is solid for the versatility and options across all the pasture and from the sea items and there always seems to be something that someone enjoys. I have enjoyed the hanger steak the best which was cooked to the right temperature and well-seasoned. The short rib was also tender but there are moments where it was a bit too fatty so some consistency if there was any critique on the dish. The charcuterie options are also good and I have enjoyed all the different cuts of protein available. One of the things that is really good on this menu is also the section I least go to for any menu. It is their coconut cake off of their dessert menu. I really don't eat desserts often but this one is pretty amazing. The cake is extremely moist (ugh hate using that word but best way to describe) and it comes poured with a vanilla bean sauce over it. A fellow yelp elite ordered it and I promised to just take a bite the first time but I think I ended up eating half of it. Whoops!  All in all, a solid place for dinner with the options and make sure to save room for that cake!",

It's large and filling so it's a good thing to split, but you need to try.   My last visit I tried a gnocchi and vegetable special but was quite disappointed.

A very nice restaurant; comfortable and relatively quiet (although I understand that's not always the case). Our server was absolutely fantastic - personable, efficient, helpful...all the great traits you hope for in a server. Our food was served quickly and it was oh so delicious! My colleague got the mac-n-cheese and I had a spoonful and ooooh-la-la! Wonderfulness in a bowl! We both enjoyed both of our meals, the overall atmosphere, and like I said, our server.

    "text": "A coworker and I were in Charlotte for the week and stopped into Roosters last night.  We sat at the bar.  The food was good, and I did like the atmosphere, but our service sucked.  Neither of the bartenders wanted to help us, but we eventually got served by a server.  After our meal came we both would have ordered another drink but were never asked even though we sat there with empty glasses.  Once we finished our meal it was painful trying to get our checks so we could leave.  Disappointed.",

    "text": "I like the food here, almost everything is almost always good.  This last visit, though, the service was very slow.  When we made reservations, we were told we had to make them for 5:15 as 5:30 was already full.  However, at 5:30, we still hadn't had our orders taken and the restaurant around us was still empty.  At least two in the party were already on their second beers, we had to repeatedly ask for more bread as they didn't even bring out enough bread for the number of people at the table--and after 30 minutes we asked for a bread refill because they still hadn't taken our food orders.    It was amusing to watch the server explain the menu set-up to each person as she was taking their order--but it didn't seem to occur to her to explain to the table at large how the menu was organized.  She also struggled with the checks later, and, although we did have a party of 8, I didn't see any automatic gratuity added.  I ordered the mushroom medley which was absolutely delicious--and of course it was, it was swimming in herbed butter!--the parsnip (singular) which was supposed to be roasted but was noticeably blackened and crunchy (and a much smaller serving that I'd have expected for $10), and the mac and cheese side.  The server cautioned me about ordering another dish as I was attempting to, that these three were plenty.  The mac and cheese wasn't that big (size of a typical starchy side) and the single parsnip was disappointing, but the mushrooms came in a LARGE soup bowl and were cut into nice large pieces as well.  There weren't any leftovers, but she was right that I definitely did not need another dish.    In the area, I think this is my favorite sit-down place.",

The scallops were perfect... the dish was the perfect size the peas and broccoli made me nervous but once I had the first bite I was pleasantly surprised. The combination was delicious ....   The pimento started and wings are a must have. Now let's talk about the hibiscus tea.... I'm sure I had two cups and took two packs home. The fries seem house cut and we're great. I went with a group so we kind of just ordered everything. This is my GM's favorite spot she's here pretty often and I can tell you why the food is just amazing.

The food was delicious, the server Gavin was attentive and offered pleasing suggestions. He hit a home run with the wine he suggested! Roosters is pricey, but we all agreed it was a wonderful evening. We were even reminiscing the following day. As my dinner I had the Fried Oyster appetizer and a side of Roasted Beets. There were about 10 briny oysters with a small cup of cocktail sauce. The cocktail sauce wasn't needed because the oysters were so good. In fact our friends placed an order to add to their dinner once they tasted mine. My husband enjoyed the Housemade Pasta with Mixed Seafood in a buttery seafood broth with a hint of tomato. He loved it. In addition to their oyster add-on, our friends had the 1/4 roasted chicken, a dinner salad, and side of Macaroni and Cheese. The salad was so-so but the chicken was reported to be juicy and flavorful. Sides are offered a la carte to be shared family style. Although we ordered beets and macaroni & cheese as the only sides, they were sizable enough that we didn't finish them but wished we had been able to since they were delicious.",

We started out with a sampler of various meats, cheeses and olives served with some toasted bread. Everything was simply fantastic. Great flavors that complimented each other. You can put this sampler platter together yourself but we weren't sure what some of the possibilities were so we let our waiter Chris pick everything out. He did a great job and was very knowledgeable about the different cheeses and meats. We absolutely loved his choices.  For a main dish my wife had the gnocchi and they were some of the best I have ever tried. They are soft and doughy like fresh homemade gnocchi should be and the sauce was wonderful. I had the BBQ half chicken and a side of au gratin potatoes. The chicken was out of this world and the potatoes were equally as good. The price/portion point seems reasonable for the quality of the food. If you haven't tried this restaurant it should be at the top of your list- truly a great dining experience!",

The food however was to die for. I had the fried oysters that melted in my mouth for appetizer. For my entree I had the salmon with wilted spinach and onion rings. All three items were A+++.

I have had grandmas two day-old pot roast taste better and more moist than that.  They tried to make it right by bringing out the scallops as a swap and a complimentary fried oysters app. The scallops were ok but nothing special. The oysters could have stayed in the kitchen.  Additionally, all of our food was out to us in less 10m (prob 5m) from ordering. I like good service but whoa...i don't even think we toast our (canned) beer yet!

So, kudos that on this rainy, cold evening I could park in the garage that is RIGHT THERE and not have to get wet to get to the restaurant. (Pull in off of College).  The hostess at the door was great and we decided to have a cocktail before going to our table as we were a little early. Unfortunately, that is really the only ding of the evening. We ordered Bulleit Rye Manhattans and they were cloyingly sweet. So sweet I asked the bartender if she added cherry juice (as they were slightly red, too). She said no, so I assume the sweet vermouth ratios were off.  We had dinner upstairs. (We sat in a booth and the partition next to my head was so dusty it looked hairy...yech) They have a great charcuterie menu! I will have to come back with multiple carnivores to get a good experience with this, but unfortunately this trip my pescatarian friend wasn't into that.  No more criticisms from here on out. I had short ribs and mushrooms and my friend had scallops and wilted spinach. Perhaps too much butter on the veggies, but the short rib was fall-apart tender, and the scallops (served on a beet puree)were just the right size, with a nice sear on the outside.  I asked for a validation for parking on the way out and I thought she said it would still be $2. When I left the garage, I paid $4, so maybe she meant $2 off. I don't give a damn, I would have paid more for valet- I just was happy not to have to walk in the rain.",

We had 5 in our party and we each ordered our own main course but shared 3 different veggie options - corn, asparagus, and green beans. To start we ordered a charcuterie board that was fantastic.   Perfect for a night of celebrating or a nice out on the town.",

Food was amazing we all got something different- tried the ducks wings (my favorite), mushroom pizza, quarter chicken and all were outstanding. The drink list has a great variety-but our server was less than attentive so we did not have the opportunity to order too many drinks. We will definitely return with hopes of having better service.",

The entrance on East 5th Street requires that you enter through the Bank of America building and go up the escalator. There are beautiful mounted roosters above the host stand and the restaurant has dark wood and is dimly lit.  I had the hanger steak ($17) and the bf had the salmon ($17). We ordered the au gratin potatoes ($7) and the pan fried corn ($6) for sides. Everything was delicious and perfectly portioned in my opinion. My bf was in love with the au gratin potatoes. They were cheesy and had an uber yummy creamy taste to it! The service was good and the food came out with little wait. We'll definitely be back.",

We ordered the charcuterie sampler to start. The spread of meats & cheeses was enough to get our palates excited.  But that's where the excitement ended for most of us. I appreciate what Rooster's is trying to do, but I agree with some of the others that say it seems a little overpriced. The bill was picked up by our boss & even if it wasn't, it would have been expensed, so while I got to enjoy myself I don't know if I would go that often if I lived in the city.   I had the mac & cheese and the wilted spinach. The mac & cheese was creamy but lacked a touch of salt. The spinach was delicious, but there was a little too much liquid on the plate for my personal preference. However, when I took a bite of spinach with mac & cheese at the same time, it was a perfect bite.   Meet some friends in the bar, grab a beer or two & share some snacks. If you're not used to this type of dining (smaller portions, farm to table, etc) this place isn't for you. If you're expecting 'traditional American-sized portions' find somewhere else. You won't be happy here.",

That chicken was roasted to perfection and juicy!  The spinach was tasty, succotash, delish but the potatoes au gratin were dream worthy!  The up side to going with a large group is getting to sample a bit of everything and is was good!  I think we shared a bread pudding for dessert that was delicious and I'm typically not big on sweets.

    "text": "I was really excited to try Roosters because it was suggested to me by several people while I was in town on business. Sadly, it did not live up to the hype.   I arrived around 545pm on a weekday evening and it was not very busy at all. I grabbed a seat at the bar since I was solo. Immediately I noticed that the bartender was very grouchy and abrasive. After handing me a drink menu he proceeded to retreat to the corner, even after seeing I was ready to order he did not come over for 10 mins. He made and delivered my drink which was very good but he did not offer me a food menu. 20 mins later he finally gave me one. I decided on the mussels which were a daily special. I let him know I was gluten free and to not include the bread. Of course when my meal arrived the bread was in my bowl. I really didn't want to have to send it back but I also wasn't in the mood to be sick all night when I'm traveling. So that was rather frustrating.   While my mussels where very good I was overall disappointed in the service. The bartender was just simply not a happy man and needed to work on his customer service skills.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch on a work day with a few friends.  Decided morning of we should probably make reservations as places in Uptown can get SLAMMED for lunch.  Luckily you can make a reservation through Open Table, even during lunch time!  Anyway, we arrived for our reservation and were promptly seated upstairs in a booth (I had no clue this place has two floors) even though only two of the four of us had arrived.  Our waiter was super friendly and came to take our drink orders promptly despite us waiting on two others.  I ordered the turkey salad/bowl thing (confusing because its listed under the salads/bowls, but our waiter called it a salad).  One of my friends ordered a burger, another the chicken salad croissant, and the other ended up with the chicken bowl when he found out they had run out of the salmon cakes special.  Our food took what seemed like forever which is honestly the reason I may not come back for lunch, but instead try dinner next time.  Once we got our food mine was delicious and filling.  I may recommend a cranberry compote instead of dried cranberries as I felt it needed a little more sauce to tie the dish together, but I was pleased nonetheless.   I'd recommend as a lunch spot if you are having a working lunch and not in a rush, especially if you have an hour or a little more to spend.  My friend did say he had been there a few times with his wife for dinner on special occasions so I would give it a try for that as well.",

The decor is trendy, and the menu is enticing. My date and I both ordered the shrimp and grits, which is spicy but manageable and just the right portion size. We split a side of succotash, which was sweet and buttery and would have been too much for one person. No drinks or time for dessert, but maybe when we come back. A little pricey for every-day lunch but definitely good for a date or to impress a client or guest.",

Our server was very nice, but it's the food that I found disappointing. The tomato bisque was really great, but the shishito pepper \"salad\" was lacking. The peppers were good, but that's because shishito peppers are good on their own. Same goes for the side of beets. They were basically just warmed up. A restaurant usually adds something exciting or pairs it with something unusual, but they both fell flat. Definitely not worth ordering those-you can find a better recipe for those veggies on Google. We tried the \"frites\" (basic shoestring fries-nothing crazy) with a sriracha aioli that was good and not too strong that it was too spicy, and also the onion rings which were good because they were thin, but extremely greasy and didn't come with a sauce (the aioli from the fries made them better). Then, there were the wings. The smoked wings came recommended and three of the four people at our table ordered them, but no one finished them. Why? SALT. The meat itself was very good, but the seasoning included so much salt it almost dried out your mouth to to take a bite. Though the ranch helped a little to negate that taste, it was still too overwhelming to bother.",

Bar area with several screen TVs to catch the latest sports game. Fire place so warm and inviting on a cool night. There is a whole dining area next to the bar.  As you head upstairs to the dining area, the aroma as well as the smell from the kitchen hits you. Inquiring minds want to know- What is Today's special?  The pasta are freshly made and you can not go wrong. Mac n Cheese delicious as well as the Burrata.  There is an extensive menu like 2-3 pages on a clip board.  Had the duck confit which was very salty. The short ribs and beets were also too salty.  Will definitely be back for the pasta and happy hour.  Very attentive waitstaff.",

    "text": "Rooster's is located in the 1 Bank of America Center building and boasts a lower floor bar area (entrance on S College) as well as an upstairs restaurant area (entrance at 1BAC, or through the bar and upstairs).  It's a well-frequented place by people working in the immediate area (i.e. consultants, Bank of America employees... etc).  It's a pretty popular place no matter what the day is because of it's convenience in the Uptown area.  I've visited on several occasions at this point as it is a solid place for a decent dinner.  They have a very large menu with items for people of all appetites and diets.  In particular, they have a large selection of cheese and charcuteries as well as meats.  Service is decent and the atmopshere here is great, especially for a business dinner.  I've had many of the things on the menu and the items that stick out are the charcuteries (so many to choose from and it varies daily), the scallops, which were perfectly seasoned and cooked, and the duck breast and hanger steak which was also cooked to the preferred temperature and well seasoned.  Also notable was the delicious mussels - the tomato-y garlic sauce was so flavorful and amazing you'll want tons of extra bread to soak it all up.  You honestly can't really go wrong with anything on the menu - I've tried other people's dishes and they were all great.  The star at Rooster's, however, is the coconut cake.  I'm a huge fan of cakes in general and I don't usually sway in the direction of coconut-flavored things, but the coconut cake here is amazing.  I've had it twice dining in and was craving it so bad one week that I even took one on the go to enjoy back at my hotel room.  It definitely tastes better when you dine in because they pour much more of the delicious vanilla bean sauce on it, but either way, it's great.  The cake is super moist and together with the sauce, it's amazing.  If you have a sweet tooth like me, this is a definite must-get.  The pecan pie (which I am also a huge fan of in general) was a huge meh for me.    Solid place for an after-work happy hour or business dinner with lots of things for every palette.",

I was looking for a place close to her hotel and also one that would show off our cities culinary skills. We decided to start with the Brussel sprouts; they were recommended by both my husband who had dined here previously and our waiter ( who was nice but never gave us his name) These were most definitely the highlight of our meal. Moving to entree's, both my friend and I had difficulty reading the menu due to both the small font and extreme lack of good light . (We are only 51 and I had to use my phone light for us to read the menu) This was both irritating and annoying- I ended up just going with the mushroom pizza based on a review I read previously, and she chose the shrimp. Everything came from the kitchen promptly - her shrimp were rubbery and over cooked and half of my pizza was burnt. Not what I was expecting. Conversation was easy to be had , as we were towards the back of the restaurant and the noise level wasn't loud and also made for us not interested in sending our meals back. If I were to dine here again and under different circumstances, I probably would have ordered differently- I think their shareable sides are the way to go . She had gelato for dessert and I had the coconut cake. The cake was overly sweet and the gelato was , well, vanilla gelato! You really can't mess that up.  With so many restaurants to choose from in uptown Charlotte, I can't say I Will be recommending or running back to dine here anytime soon.  I wasn't that impressed .",

A few of my dining mates found the menu a bit confusing, as 4 beige papers were secured to a clipboard, 2 for the menu, 2 for wines and beverages. I think the menu was not organized  as most are with appetizers, salads, poultry, meat, pasta  categories etc.. Actually I found the menu intriquing with listings for: from the larder, the woods,  from the garden etc. Plenty of  menu choices for  pizzas, charcuterie, cheeses, sandwiches, pasta, steak and seafood , yummy desserts, but   can be pricey depending what was ordered as entrees  are ala cart. We ordered among us : Fried oysters, iceberg salad, tomato bisque, 1/2 roast chicken entree, fish entree, steak entrees, side of mashed potatoes, mushroom medley. Food plated nicely, came out hot. Portion sizes varied.$40 steaks, nice size, cooked to order, fish entree small piece, pricey for the size. Bread and butter on the table. All dishes were very tasty.",

We didn't get our lives together to make reservations until that afternoon, but were still able to score a reservation for 8:30. We showed up at 8:15 & it only took a few minutes for them to seat us a little early. The ambience is great...rustic, yet upscale. Pretty good beer & wine selection, but the food is the star. We started with a cheese plate & then ate an obscene amount of food. I ordered the hanger steak, which was amazing. One friend enjoyed the roasted chicken pizza, another the mushroom fregola, and the last had the quarter natural chicken. Everyone raved about their dishes. I'm not sure how they can get so much flavor into that chicken, but it was juicy & delicious.  As amazing as the main dishes were, the side dishes were just as good. We split the mac & cheese, potatoes au gratin & the succotash. They were all so good. My friend is obsessed with their green beans that weren't currently on the menu & she was slightly disappointed, but these sides were so good she got over it quickly. We will definitely be back.",

If you can be seated in a booth closer to the door leading to the bathroom, you can feel more private - which I prefer.   The staff I've dealt with during my last 3 visits has been knowledgeable, helpful and agreeable.  One of the lighting devices was aimed uncomfortably into our eyes (possibly from being cleaned), so we asked, and a server climbed up and re-directed it for us right then.  The food is fresh and tasty, and the servers tend to give detailed descriptions and answer questions in a professional fashion. I have always trusted their recommendations, and am always satisfied.  My order generally consists of a charcuterie plate with a bresaola and something close to prosciutto (I ask which current meat is closest to it), then 2 cheeses - also depending on the recommendation of the server and what they are featuring. Depending on appetite, a Barbee arugula with apples & chevre salad and maybe another item can suffice for two. Again, the special salad and meats must be taken into consideration. These often make the meal.  The drink menu is designed to appeal to specific tastes and is manageable. The Queen's Cup - a play on the Pimm's Cup - can even be made with vodka per request.",

Boyfriend had the hanger steak. It was delicious, my only gripe is how little is served. I had the beef short ribs. Amazing and tender, I was able to cut into it easily with my fork. Portion was ok. We shared 3 sides: mac and cheese (ooey gooey cheesiness), assorted mushrooms (I would drink the sauce it comes in if it weren't for the fact that I'd be looked at as an animal), and the fingerling potatoes (simple potato wedges).

They were actually tender with a decent but not overpowering  breading, and the chili aioli dipping sauce had a sneaky heat that was just right.  Usually I'm a carnivore for my main course,  but this time I went for the mushroom pizza, a thick layer of asagio cheese served over an even thicker layer of finely chopped showrooms laced with garlic, shallots & truffle oil.  Yum.  Plain & simple.",

    "text": "Went for dinner last night. To start, our server was awful. Our first exchange from her was, \"What do you want to drink\", no welcome, no list of specials, nothing. Where we at some roadside diner?  Had the mussels to start. They were great. Good price for serving size. Husband had the special - pasta and clams in cauliflower sauce - he liked it. I ordered the hanger steak - medium from the gluten free menu (helpful) and the pommes puree (good). The steak was under cooked (my guesstimate would be closer to rare/medium rare with a cool red center), overly salty, very small (4.5-5 oz) and the sauce overpowered the flavor of the meat. It was unfortunate because it was a nice cut of meat. First tastes were charcoal/smokey and then salt. The saltiness was not preferred.  Went again today (coworkers idea - said they did lunch well). Gave it one more shot. Had another poorly trained server. No gluten free lunch menu (not a problem - just inconsistent). Friend placed three different orders because the salmon salad was sold out, as was the sandwich special - we were sat at 11:45 AM. I ordered the meatloaf if it was GF (server had to check with the chef), if not I would have the roasted BBQ half chicken. The chicken showed up (surprise!) but was never asked if I wanted sides. Finally ordered corn half way through the entree and it arrive when the dishes were cleared. No apologies.  Lovely concept for a restaurant. Very poorly executed. I will not return.",

First visit:  September, I got the pork belly 'special'  It was terrible.  AWFUL.  The sides were good, but the main meal was nasty.  The pork belly was rubbery and about the size of an art eraser and served with a juice that was not very good.  The whole meal was just bad, and it was my birthday.  They did comp me a piece of coconut cake with a candle....but the meal, i was pissed.  Second visit:  I got the quarter BBQ chicken.  It was delicious.  This is what both of my girlfriends got the first night and why they wanted to go back tonight.  It was well seasoned and delicious.  As with our first visit the sides were also on point.  So i'm going to average this review out and my tip to any future patrons would be to give the specials a very wary eye...they may be good, but they may not be.  Might be better to stick with what they do best.",

I've passed the street level entrance numerous times on foot, but never went in. At first glance , it looks very small, but once you walk in, you realize the restaurant continues upstairs. Both levels have a rustic design with intimate lighting. A very nice pick for a romantic date, or date that involves more things uptown. The menu is a la carte style, with lots of appetizers to choose from and sides that are large enough to share. This visit, I had the quarter chicken and Mac and cheese. The Mac was amazing; it was served in a mini cast iron dish , so it stayed hot the entire meal. The blend of cheeses was out of this world, and the crust on top was SO GOOD. We also sampled a great selection of red wines. The service we received was also excellent : Grant was very patient with our table, made great selections, and was very prompt and polite. I highly recommend this location for a after work dinner, date, family dinner, girls night...pretty much any occasion.",

For starters, we ordered some eggplant dish that was beautifully presented and tasty. Definitely a good way to start off. The real fun, however, came with the main meal. My personal favorite was the short rib, which you could cut with a fork and had great flavor. The duck breast was simply grilled and yummy, although it was a bit rarer than I would have preferred. For sides, we enjoyed a healthy dose of mac and cheese and some pan-fried corn. The m&c was classic and creamy, and the corn was even better (that's code for \"drowning in butter\"). I'd go back any day of the week and can't wait to return.",

The ambiance is cozy inside the restaurant or there are tables in the atrium which give a semi feel of outdoor dining (without the elements).   The food was good, however they were out of several items on the menu by the time we got there at 7:30pm. I feel like I almost need to go back to try out the items I wanted.   As a colleague summed it up, \"it's farm to table but some things get lost along the way\". They were out of the special fish, the duck breast, asparagus and the coconut cake (three of these I wanted to order, two of which I ordered and then was told they were out). The waitress seemed defensive when we joked about the fact several items weren't available.   The restaurant would be better served to have a slightly smaller primary menu and a few more specials to have better availability (or quite honestly raise price on some items to keep them stocked). I understand that you run out of specials from time to time, but asparagus?",

Everything was what you'd expect from a French restaurant and there's no room for a diet here. I have to say the mussels were very tiny and a little underwhelming IMO (I'm a bonafide seafood freak) and I would refrain from ordering them again. But overall the food hit the spot in terms of heavy, buttery, cheesy cravings. We didn't have room to check the dessert menu but I'd recommend trying it - it's a French restaurant after all.",

    "text": "My girlfriends and I came here for my birthday early February. I'm glad we made a reservation and got their early before the crowds came. It was a Wednesday night and around 6:30, there were already multiple large parties. All 6 of us girls loved the C-shaped booth where we were sat; we could easily talk to one another, all reach the yummy bread in the middle equally, and the waiter could address each of us specifically without reaching over any plates. The waiter had amazing service, even surprising me behind my backs with a bday treat (he asked my friends while I was in the restroom... sneaky and clever!), but unfortunately, he forgot to introduce himself or else I would have given him a shoutout! My friends found him very funny and charming. The dishes are priced a little high for sides or salads but you do get a shareable portion for any side you order. I heard no complaints and I loved my simple salad (something with goat cheese and corn), which was tastier than I anticipated. Roosters, I will be back! (the decor with roosters everywhere was also a nice aesthetic touch that I was amused by)",

The Mac & Cheese was to die for.  Very creamy with just the right amount of spice.  I had the Black Lab cheese appetizer.   The cheese was excellent and the toast points were perfect.   We enjoyed watching the cooks prepare the meals.   We had great interaction with the Sous Chef.   He checked on us a couple of time making sure everything was perfect.  This is a most stop if you are in Charlotte.",

I really could wax on about this sandwich for hours - that's how much I love it.  The meat is so tender, the veggies crisp and the sauce - d-lish.    The upstairs portion of the restaurant is cozy and perfect for lunch meetings or romantic dinners. The downstairs has a pubbish feel to it with communal tables and a bar.  The service is always top-notch.",

I thought the bottled wine list was extremely extensive, but the wines by the glass were a bit lackluster. I settled on a Paso Robles Cab glass of wine that was very tasty.  Throughout the night, we ordered various things that we all split. Cheese and basil pizza, side salad, mac n cheese, corn, gnocchi, and calamari. Everything we ordered was very good. The mac and cheese was phenomenal. I also really enjoyed the red sauce that was in the gnocci. The aoli served with the calamari was spot on.  Excellent meal!",

Went on a Friday night without reservations so we ended up at the Chef's Table. I was glad there were no tables available, because my younger brother thought it was really cool to see them cooking everything and yelling at each other. We had a couple of different servers throughout the meal and the service was great!   We ordered smoked wings, quarter BBQ chicken, brisket burger, mac and cheese, onion rings, and greens. The ONLY thing I was disappointed with were the greens, because there were like 7 greens and it was mostly turnips and tomatoes. Everything else was amazing! Loved the smoked wings and the BBQ chicken. They use a mustardy bbq sauce that is just delicious. The mac and cheese was to die for, and I am not even a fan of goat cheese.   Ambiance was great too and they have a ton of seasonal features. It's a little pricey, but worth it for a good, southern meal. Will be going back!",

Had steaks (a prime ribe eye & a hanger) with a veal jus that was so damn good they should serve it in a 6oz wine glass pour.  Next night (yes, we did two nights in a row) both had the pan seared flounder on roasted root vegetables, and they nailed it: perfectly crispy skin and tender & juicy inside.  Wine list is more than one would expect and is very approachable from the price perspective.",

    "text": "Rooster's is my jam!  I've tried nothing here that I didn't like, but I also have some regular goto items.  The salmon is where its at, and the BBQ chicken is incredible.  The sauce is what makes it!  Rooster's has two Charlotte locations, both of which are excellent, but this is the Uptown location.  It is an ideal spot to grab dinner before or after a show at the Time Warner Cable Arena.  Rooter's is a Jim Noble restaurant; known for outstanding service, food, and ambiance.  Desserts are baked at the affiliated King's Kitchen and Bakery.  This location functions on two levels.  The upstairs level is the dining room and main kitchen.  Downstairs you will find the bar area with shared pub style seating.  Food may still be ordered downstairs, but it's a very different feel.  Both levels offer restrooms outside of the restaurant in the main building.  There are no restrooms in the actual restaurant.  Sounds odd, but it's the nature of the building.  Rooster's offers an exceptional wine selection, and many menu items are sourced locally.  Be sure to try the charcuterie board.  Meat and cheese selections change daily, but the servers can guide you.  The liver mousse is amazing.  Don't overthink it, just order it and see for yourself!  You will have to pay for parking in the attached garage, but the restaurant will validate you for up to 90 minutes.  If you're planning to take an Uber or Lyft home, be aware that their GPS always takes them around the corner on 5th where the entrance to the escalators for the second level is.  If you exit from the lower level through the bar, your car will not be there.",

We actually came in on opening night and while it wasn't packed it had a good crowd and the service was great!! The food was awesome like usual and the decor was so shiny and new!! We sat downstairs in the bar area and then went upstairs after dinner to just see what else was going on, they had a beautiful open kitchen and great booths! This is going to be a great spot to hit for a fun Saturday night or happy hour!   We started with my FAV's the Duck Ham and Aged Guoda- if you haven't had either you need to now!! We also had the fried oysters which I've never had before but they were really good and was a good amount! Then for our entree we had the Hanger Steak-again a favorite and the Duck Gnocchi which was another new dish to me it was great the Gnocchi was cooked perfectly! We paired them with the Hericot Verts and Mashed Potatoes- the mashed potatoes were really good I had to stop myself from eating the whole dish, seeing as I was \"sharing\"!   For desert we had the Toffee Cake which I have never had and that was D-licious!! Management was great they were all so happy and excited about being open which in turn made us excited to be there!! I can't wait to be back in town so I can go back to my new hangout!! I just hope the staff doesn't get sick of me and my friends ;)",

As part of my job as a catering manager my boss asked a few of us to check this place out for lunch to see what sort of competition it was.  A free lunch?  You don't have to ask me twice!  We headed down about 1:30pm on a Wednesday and there were a total for 4 people in the place besides us.  The kitchen is totally open so you can see your food being prepared which I thought was cool but the chefs I was dining with didn't agree.  I ordered the salmon salad in an attempt to be healthy and also because it sounded good.  It came out quickly but lacked all the \"stuff\" I want in a salad.  On the menu it said roasted peppers, green beans, grilled salmon, blue cheese and lemon vinaigrette.  The salmon seemed like it was from a can, there was one roasted pepper, 2 green beans and 3 chunks of blue cheese.  The vinaigrette was more like lemon scented olive oil and I had to ask for more to coat the salad.  No good.  My coworker ordered the chicken sandwich which looked good and the fries were tasty, someone else ordered the shrimp and grits and they enjoyed it.  The service was good and it smells like a campfire in there but overall I don't know if I'd go again!",

It started out rough as the pork steam bun, one of the things we def wanted to try was 86'd even though it was early in the evening still. My biggest complaint is the menu does not give a description of how the food is made or if it comes with a sauce. I went off the pictures I've seen on YELP. This was rough because it really just hurts Roosters! The food was great. I had the hanger steak and couldn't have been happier with it. But on the menu it simply says \"hangar steak\". Our server was just ok, we needed drinks and couldn't find him. This was immediately alleviated by the manager coming by and taking care of everything! She was so nice and with her contributions, the service overall at Roosters was great! One thing you must do when at Roosters is eat the coconut cake! You can thank me later! Overall Roosters was great and its right tin themiddle of Uptown!",

Mostly because of the service experience, I'd be inclined to try other options in this area before I'd return to Roosters.",

Sadly the irons location doesn't serve the delicious French Onion soup that is a staple at the SouthPark location.   Uptown has a great lunch dish I think is not served at SouthPark. It is Vietnamese Crispy Pork sandwich. Basically it is a Bahn Mi and let me just tell you that it is outstanding. The meat is cooked crispy to perfection. The bun is buttered and cooked nicely, all the ingredients are fresh and masterfully assembled with perfect proportions. I substituted the fried with a side salad and was so pleased I took more people back the next day to try it!",

The waiter was very friendly.   First out to the table was bread and olive oil. We ordered a cheese plate ahead of the main courses that didn't disappoint. I'll be hunting down the Snow Camp and Chocolate Lab cheeses.  Entrees came out shortly after. We had the half bbq chicken and a hanger steak with fried beets and potatos au gratin on side. The hanger steak was perfect. Highly recommend. It looked small at first but after having with bread and potatoes I was stuffed.",

Fortunately we were heading to the game later that night so we parked in the parking deck near the BBT Stadium.   We were greeted immediately and made our way upstairs to the dining area. The first floor is their bar area which is also available for dining, but upstairs is more intimate and roomy.   It's very nice and dark which I like, they have mostly booths and a beautiful open kitchen. Our server was good, making some recommendations that we would later take. I have to ding them on forgetting to bring us fresh bread to the table.   Their menu is A La Carte which I was unaware of. I'm not a fan of this method of dining, it seems shady. Anyhow, we ordered the recommended Beef Short Rib and the Salmon. We wanted pureed potatoes, but unfortunately they weren't ready at the time so we chose Mac & Cheese instead.   The food was delicious and well presented, however the portions were pathetic! For what they're charging they need to give the customer a bigger portion. We were both literally rationing our food in order to make it somewhat last. Small portions are a sign of a stingy owner and a stingy chef.   The meal was very expensive and we ended up eating again at the ballpark. I would not recommend this restaurant if you're hungry. You will leave hungry and unfulfilled.",

Rooster's is located right in the heart of the city, so it's a great place to stop if you're out one night. We typically make it a post-dinner stop for a glass of wine. The bar area is intimate with a huge community table in the center in the room and additional tables around the perimeter. Upstairs, they have a large dining space with an open kitchen concept which is aesthetically pleasing.  Wine prices are fair and they have a huge selection. The service has always been friendly and attentive and keeps us coming back. I'm looking forward to actually enjoying a meal here!",

The food is the best thing here and probably closer to five stars. They offer some unique dishes and some real stand outs.  For lunch I go with the brisket burger or hickory fired NC pork bbq sandwich. Their fries are amazing.   With cocktails or before dinner, get some smoked wings. They are very tasty. For dinner the beef short rib or hanger steak are best from the regular menu. The best special is the gnocchi with 4 meat bolognese. The best side dish for either lunch or dinner is the pan fried corn. You will want to eat more vegetables after eating this corn dish.   And for dessert you MUST have the coconut cake. I grew up in Hawaii and often get turned off by anything coconut on the Mainland, but this is Hawaii worthy.   The service is hit or miss at the bar. One bartender is great, but a couple others have way too much attitude. It's not the best bar in Charlotte and they're certainly not the best bartenders, but they think they are. Without those two I would likely rate Roosters 5 Stars.   The food is worth going and if you want a pleasant experience stay upstairs. If you want to be ignored then don't listen to me and head downstairs to the bar.",

There are some huge exceptions and these guys are one of them.  You can come in through the front door downstairs or in through the Bank of America building upstairs.  The downstairs entry leads you straight to the bar and is great for a quick bite.  However, I prefer the upstairs, where I can see the open kitchen.  You can see it all, foodies rejoice!  You can see and even feel the wood fired ovens, if you sit close enough.  These chef's can obviously take the heat.  As far as the food goes, we ordered it all.  The waiter knew off hand where many of the ingredients came from.  First, I tried a beautifully crafted BLT.  Kind of funny because they pretty much share the Ritz with BLT steak.  All smokey and crunchy.  A must in my mind.  Then, superb shrimp and grits.  Next, a cool play on bahn mi done NC style with sous vide pork shoulder and house made pickled veg.  Smoked and spice rubbed chicken wings that put pretty much any bar in Charlotte to shame.  Even the meatloaf was taken to the next level.  The sweet potatoes were a perfect match.  I don't have anything bad to say, I love this place.  If I was a banker still, they would see me 2-3 times a week.  I can not think of another downtown restaurant that I'd recommend over it if someone asked.",

So Rooster's is awesome.. the Fried Oyster Salad is amazing and the tomato basil bisque  is yummy.   They also have the best coffee...    Great lunch spot.",

Don't you all think that means a restaurant is expensive???  Anyways, I was right...I mean expensive is relative, but compared to what we're used to, it was...but that's OK. The food was fu**ing fantastic.   Why then only four stars???, well, because it was pricey and because the portions was small, in my opinion. The food was so good that I wanted more of everything we got, but to get more, we would have had to place a second order and shell out another $150 or so and that night we could not...we had a show to go to.  Next time though, I'll remember to get three orders of the liver mousse...one as an appetizer, one to go with my normal meal and one to take home...",

We didn't get much more than a \"hey, you're ready to order\". No name, no hello.  Their wine list is extensive which is awesome.  When wanting some help to pick a wine, he had to leave to \"read up\" on the three we had picked as choices.  When he came back he just rattled off some specs he had clearly trouble remembering. We decided on a wine only to then find out he didn't have it in stock.  He brought an alternative (not one of the other two we had had in mind).  Which of course was more expensive.  Frustrating.  Gave up on the wine and switched to beer.  He came back with cans.  Canned beer in a restaurant of this type is a total let down.  Especially when it's poured at your table.  It looks cheap.  My boyfriend's dish was really good (duck gnocchi).  My dish of the other hand (pea/ribs ravioli) tasted like only one thing:  SALT.  Their chef is heavy handed with the salt clearly as I've read up on some other reviews which stated the same thing. Overall, our visit was a bit of a let down.",

I love the kale salad! If you are planning a night out with friends or a celebration- the staff at Rooster's will take care of you!

The people that had the roasted chicken thought it was good, but found it to be light on flavor. They do not serve the chicken with any sauces. It is a simple wood roast preparation. Again, they thought it was good, just not quite what they expected. I had the wings and loved them. So if you like your wood roasted chicken with a little kick, go for the wings. Everyone that had the beef entrees thought they were excellent. Service was a bit slow like when it was time for drink refills. And we were all a bit surprised how long it took to get our entrees. But nothing too crazy. The menu can be a bit overwhelming. I would suggest a bit more explanation of some of the less well known/southern items. That would help streamline the ordering process.

From the Bank of America parking garage, go through the doors near the elevators on Level 6.  A short walk takes you to a down escalator that puts you at the upstairs entrance.  The food was very good and our server, Matt, was very helpful as we navigated the menu.  His knowledge of the menu was on point as he explained the differences in the red wine reductions served over the duck breast and beef short ribs.  (Duck breast sauce more sweet and short ribs sauce more savory.)  We shared the charcuterie sampler (3 meats, 2 cheeses and crostini served with olives and hot mustard.)  We made our selections from both the standard menu and the daily menu, which included sopresatta and salami.  A great appetizer for sharing.  Our entrees were the braised beef short ribs and the salmon.  The ribs were tender and flavorful.  The preparation of the salmon was very simple (seasoned and grilled) but was executed perfectly.  We had sides of pan fried corn and yukon puree and both were excellent.  The portion sizes of the sides were sufficient for two.  In summary, great food and great service.  Can be a bit pricey when you start adding sides.  But we will definitely go back.",

We started with kale caesar salads, and chose hanger steak and the pork belly special served with black rice and root vegetables as entrees, and the pan fried corn as a side.  Everything was well prepared and delicious. We enjoyed the ambiance, the attentive service, and the convenient location.  Our dinner was a bit expensive, but there are plenty of less expensive options on the menu.",

First the menu, I understand it is Tapas, was extremely complicated, did not flow well and was very unclear.  This was the worst menu I have ever seen.  Second, the food was below average, especially the Flank steak which had a chemically after taste.  Also the ceasear salad was almost unedible.   However, the goodnews.  The Au gratin potatoes were simply perfect, covered in melted cheese.  Seriously the best potatoes ever.  CongratS!  Definantly not a place I will be back at, over priced for the quality of food you received, sorry Rooster.",

The food is fantastic, I've ordered a few things on their menu and it's always good but I tend to eat most of my husbands pasta-it's a simple dish but it's the best pasta I've ever had. The customer service here is great too! I went to this location a week or so ago and ordered the tomato soup as an app without realizing there was goat cheese on it so I had to send it back (I'm pregnant) and the waiter was so gracious about it! We told him why and at the end I also ordered a dessert which came with flakes of brandy (or some kind of alcohol) so he warned me just in case! The prices here are also very reasonable. When I could drink the mojitos are very good! So far it's my favorite place in Charlotte and we've been to quite a few!",

    "text": "I made a reservation at Rooster's on NYE before the Widespread Panic concert around the corner at the arena.  It has a great location to grab a bite to eat if you're going to an event there.  I have a friend that was a chef at the South Park location for a few months, but I never dined there.  The food was pretty good and I wish I would have tried it out sooner.  We shared a 3 cheese plate, she had a salad, and I had the steak burger.  The cheese plate was was a great way to start off the meal.  The Gouda was my favorite as it had a great smokey flavor.  Each cheese is about $7-8 per 2 oz. serving, but you can get a 3 cheese/1oz. sampler for $13.  I can't say much for the salad, I only took one bite, but it was fresh with a nice light vinaigrette.  My burger was great though.  It was cooked perfectly and was very juicy.  It had a ciabatta bun over a traditonal one.  I think a traditional bun would be better suited in my opinion, but the meat is the most important part and they nailed it.  It came with a choice of side and I got the mac & cheese.  The sauce was creamy and it had a nice sharp flavor.  You can order from a choice of 3 different cheeses and I went with cheddar (server recommended the cheddar over the other choices).  The burger w/ side was $10, pretty reasonable.  I didn't see a beer list, but I tried a local Charlotte brew that I haven't had before.  That's always a good thing.  The service was great and I had a good meal in a cool open kitchen atmosphere that put me in an awesome mood to ring in 2013!",

    "text": "I found Rooster Wood-Fired Kitchen to be ... acceptable. Nothing spectacular, several mis-steps, food was OK to good, but not out-of-this-world. I'm holding this place to a bit higher standard than a typical casual-fine-dining place for two reasons. First, I was a customer of Noble's back in the day, and recall the exquisite food and service there. Second, at the rates they charge, it ought to be perfect.  Ambiance: 4/5, but not what I was expecting. I disagree wholeheartedly with Aubrey F's characterization of this place as \"romantic\". It would be more well-suited to a large group having dinner and drinks than a romantic dinner. Large, noisy, open dining room with the kitchen in the middle. They use what is almost certainly reclaimed local wood as part of the decor. That's great, unless you're wearing a sweater and keep sticking to the side of the booth whenever your arm brushes it.  Service: 2.5/5 The best way I can describe the service is \"muddled fine dining\". Between the service and the food, it felt like a restaurant that had been open for a few weeks, not since March. We ordered a cheese plate appetizer, a soup, and two entrees. Here's how that worked: The server came by and asked what kind of water we'd like; water arrived quickly. She came back and asked if we were ready to order; we said we'd like the cheese plate, but weren't sure about entrees. The cheeses arrived within two minutes - really amazingly fast! We ate the cheese, leisurely, and were almost done when the server arrived to take our order. We placed the rest of the order. The soup arrived so quickly that I kind of pictured a very eager soup chef, ladle in one hand, HOVERING over the soup, ready to spoon out a bowl. Then a good 15-20 minutes passed before our entrees arrived. The gap between ordering and entree wouldn't have been so bad if she'd taken our order shortly after giving us the cheese, and if they'd held the soup a bit. The result of the service was we had \"cheese...pause a moment...soup....wait and wait...and wait....entree\", where it should have been \"cheese, pause for a bit, soup, pause for a bit, entree\".   Food: 3/5 The food was okay. A basket of wheat bread with a nice tasty olive oil showed up pretty quickly. The cheese plate - our \"selection of 3\"  - was delicious, and the high point of the meal. It was served with ... oh, I don't remember the name... thinly-sliced bread that had been toasted over the wood fire. Delicious. The tomato basil bisque was also very good. The entrees and side-dishes... My wife had the hangar steak. It was tender and well-seasoned, though she found it a bit salty. The fingerling potatoes were good-but-not-great - roasted sliced fingerling potatoes with just a bit of golden-brown crust on them. I had the pasta with squid ink, squid, and scallops. The good: The flash-fried scallops were delicious. The sauce had a lot of flavor to it, and the pasta was perfectly al-dente; the squid (so easy to do wrong!) was perfectly tender. The problem, again, was the salt level. It was almost bad enough to mention but not quite, that sort of \"this is okay but I wouldn't get it again\" thing.   All in all, I found Rooster's to be adequate, nothing special. And I kind of was expecting something special, so I was a little disappointed.",

    "text": "I feel like I have to write a few comments about our experience at Roosters uptown on Feb. 15. It was a late Valentines dinner before a show uptown for us. When I entered, one of the first things I saw was that the restaurant inspection score on display was one of the lowest I have seen in Charlotte restaurant. I debated for a minute, then decided to give it a try anyway. We were seated promptly, but were seated at tables where the well-used  menus (with dirty fingerprints) were placed on top of our bread plates, not handed to us. I was truly grossed out, and did not touch that plate. I noticed that a table nearby that was reserved for a large party was set up in the same manner. I should have spoken up, but didn't. I'm not a germaphobe, but that is pushing the limits where public health is concerned.  Our server was very nice, but clearly inexperienced, and often no where to be found. It's the type of restaurant where I would have expected a little more training of the employees. Our food took a really long time, and our server did not keep us updated. We were early, and most of the later arrivals were eating before we were.   I had the chef's special salad of the evening, which was very good but the dressing was a bit salty. My hanger steak was well prepared, but presented naked on the plate. My dining companion had the ravioli with short ribs, which he found to be well prepared, but a bit on the small size. In both cases, adding a little something to the plate would make you feel like your serving size was adequate and improve presentation.  Not sure if or when we'll try Roosters again. My low score mostly reflects slow service, sanitation and presentation of the food, not quality, all of which are easily addressed.",

    "text": "I went here for a relaxing lunch, drawn by the scent of smoke. As I was dining alone, I was offered a choice of a seat by the cooking area (a backless stool) or a booth. I chose the booth, as those stools looked very uncomfortable. The upstairs has dining tables and the cooking area for seating. The place is dim and reasonably quiet, very stark, almost monastic decor. I had my heart set on shrimp and grits, but wanted the waiter's opinion on what was best. After learning he felt the shrimp and grits were the best in CLT, I went for it. As the menu advertised they had bread baked special for them at King's Bakery, I was surprised no bread basket was offered or provided. My food arrived and it looked and smelled amazing. Four shrimp, some andouille sausage and grits in a spicy red sauce. The grits were very coarsely ground, which became an issue, as I kept getting unexpected, sharp pieces of corn husk in my mouth. The dish was quite good, except for the grits. One doesn't expect sharp anything in grits. The waiter returned immediately after I received my plate and before I tasted the food, then never returned except to collect my check, leaving my order in the hands of the busboy (who was quite nice and helpful). The busboy offered me a dessert menu (I passed as desserts are $8 a pop and all I wanted was a bite of something sweet), got me my check and was genuinely attentive (something I can't say for the waiter). Don't know that I'll return, but I might give them another chance.",

Although this wasn't our initial selection, I must say I'm happy we ate here.   I ordered their special duck sausage dinner, which was served with house made kimchi and a side of flash fried cornbread cake. For only $14, this meal was amazing! Their regular menu was reasonably priced too. I recommend eating upstairs, as you get a nice view of their open kitchen.",

The host is very nice and I was seated right away. The place was busy but not packed for a Saturday memorial weekend night. My server Ricky was excellent, he's friendly and attentive. He recommended some wine for my sweet taste and the choices were good. I ordered catch of the day served with wild rice. The dish was prepared nicely the portion was small which is normal for an upscale restaurant. If you don't like spicy food I suggest stay away from ordering this. The fish was cooked nicely but too salty for my taste. They might  added too much seasoning in my food. I like my food seasoned well but not overwhelming. And I love spicy food. So this dish didn't impress me. Unfortunately I didn't order anything else to rate so as for now I can only put a 3 star because the food was so so for the price tag.",

    "text": "This is my 2nd time at Rooster's - tried some different dishes.  Ordered the hanger steak medium rare, Mac and cheese and pan fried corn (these 3 items were high on the recommendation list from other Yelpers)  Hangers steak definitely lived up to the hype - cooked exactly as ordered, can definitely taste the smokey fire flavor and whatever that sauce is they put on top was delicious.  Pam fried corn also good - very well balance flavor of sweet and savory, could go a little lighter with the salt based on my own preference (but that's my palate I think)  Mac and Cheese was solid but I have had better elsewhere.  Cheese sauce had nice texture, however I would have liked to see a more toasted top and again, similar to the first experience I had here. The square plate presentation is pretty but not the friendliest to eat from and the pasta cooled too quickly in my opinion.  I also tried the Wittekerke (in place of blue moon which they do not have).  Good recommendation from the bartender.  Something that I thought could use a little improvement - the bar is decent size and at one time there were at least 2 bartenders there plus a 3rd helper.  But there are also times where the bar was completely unmanned (as in bar full of people sitting there, no one behind the counter).  Both time I sat and ate at the bar - not that easy to grab the attention from staff.  So if expecting a normal meal service I would suggest sitting at a table.",

And the accompanying marinara sauce is excellent. It's so light and fresh and packed with flavor. IMHO these are the best fried oysters in Charlotte.   I also love the smoked chicken wings and sauteed spinach, which are available on both the lunch and dinner menus.  Recently, I tried the Scallop Salad which is served over arugula. It includes corn, avocado, and lime buttermilk dressing. The scallops were delicious!!  I have also tried the grilled yellow tail, which was one of the nightly dinner specials. It was very enjoyable.   The atmosphere is upscale rustic. The first level is a trendy bar, with specials after 4pm. The upper level houses the restaurant and kitchen.  It's a great place for lunch or dinner. The dinner menu is more extensive. They also have a concise, yet interesting wine list. Add this place to your list! You won't regret it.",

Among us, we ordered the macaroni and cheese, gnocchi, margherita pizza, barbeque chicken, and scallops. The girls who ordered the mac and cheese, scallops and gnocchi were very pleased. Everything was cooked to perfection and tasty. However, the margherita pizza was utterly tasteless and the barbeque chicken was just nothing special. Given the relatively high price tag on many of the menu items, we were certainly expecting more.   Service was pretty disappointing. It was pretty clear our waiter was taking advantage of the 20% gratuity included for large groups, as it was like pulling teeth to get any level of service. Water glasses were left unfilled and he seemed inconvenienced by having to serve us.   That being sad, the atmosphere and decor inside Rooster's is great. Very cozy and True to the farm to table vibe.",

Ordered Calamari for an appetizer. It was good, but not the best.   I ordered fried oysters for dinner. Not highly impressed. However the sides (potatoes au gratin and onion rings) were excellent.

Rooster's boasts an American-style menu with lots of options from charcuterie plates to pasta, salads and flatbreads to protein-based dishes. There's also plenty of side options including potatoes, mushrooms, and other vegetables. I like that the menu can be tailored to lots of different needs - you could treat it like a small plates menu, ordering a number of different dishes and trying/sharing everything, or you could treat it like a more traditional menu, where you order appetizers and then a protein + side. Note: In my experience, the portions seem to be sized as if it is a small plates menu.   I ordered a pick-up order to take back to my hotel room for dinner (the quarter roasted chicken + haricot verts w/ garlic + a bottle of sparkling water) and was surprised at how quickly my order added up to ~$30. The chicken looked and smelled delicious, but there was a slight burned taste on the crispy skin which took away from the chicken itself :( The haricot verts were very fresh and crunchy with lots of garlic on top (mmm, garlic), but there couldn't have been more than a cup or two in my to-go container. I could have eaten an entire bowl of those things.    Rooster's is a little on the pricey side, but it's a decent restaurant in Uptown if you are looking for some fresh, American-style food.",

We parked in the deck right there at the restaurant where they validate, which was an added bonus.  Walking in, we found a really cool vibe, combining rustic with modern and urban.  There was a bit of a wait so we took a seat at the bar.  Had I reviewed the other Yelp reviews beforehand (shame on me) I would have realized that reservations are HIGHLY recommended here.  When our table was ready, we were led up some stairs to a big dining area we had no idea even existed!  (Side note: there is apparently first-come first-served seating available up there that they don't tell you about at the front.)  The menu had all your southern classics with modern twists on them.  The mains are served a la carte and the sides are family style.  If you order one of the daily specials, as we both did, you'll find that they come with their own sides.  I got the pork chop.  This was a big azz piece of beautiful meat, bone-in, tender, juicy, and buttery (almost too buttery).  It was served on top of this bean and green situation which was equally delightful.    Only thing that kept me from going fiver on this one was the service.  We didn't see our waiter much and he didn't explain anything on the menu until we asked him directly.  At a nice place such as this one, you expect your waiter to offer specials and explain things that are unique about their menu.    This is definitely a spot we'll return to!",

Unfortunately, pretty much everything was overpowered by salt.  The wings were too salty, the steak was too salty (and over cooked as well), the only thing that wasn't too salty was the pees, which were excellent.  Overall, I was left disappointed.  There are too many places that do this type of food really well, I'm looking at you Soul gastrolounge, for me to throw good money after bad at Rooster's",

It has two floors the top which is more open than the bottom.  We had our Christmas party here, it was a little tight and very open as we were on the first floor.  The food wasn't too bad, we had a variety of aps and wine/beer.  I'd return to another event here.",

    "text": "First time venturing to Rooster's.   Was very pleased and not overly surprised since I've heard nothing but very good things.  After my out-of-town manager told me to select our lunch meeting spot, given Rooster's location and all the great things I've heard, it was first to pop in my mind.  The food was delicious!  Trying to eat on the lighter side, I opted for the seared scallops with a broccoli and peas salad.  Scallops prepared perfectly!!  My lunch companion's choice was the Meatlof and pureed sweet potato.  After seeing his extremely clean plate, it was obvious it was immensely enjoyed.  The only lunch time warning I'll provide is that reservations are a must if you expect to dine in the bit more formal upstairs dining room. No reservations forced us to eat at a community table in the downstairs bar area.  It wasn't awful and of course the entire menu is available, but just be aware, especially if heading here with a group.",

Visited today around 4:30pm; no crowd but I was greeted by no one, went to the bar and the bartender just stares at me as if I should speak first, he didn't even bother to come to my location at the bar until I asked for menu. Placed my order and began to wait, wasn't asked if I would like a drink while I wait; what happened to being customary? Either way after 20 minutes or so i see a to go bag sitting behind the bar. I walks over and the bartender begins to perform other actions like cleaning out a glass and taking other drinks for 5 minutes before he looks at my food, he then places the check in front of some lady as if I should know that it was for me. Long story short the service sucked ass.  The Frites should be called potato chips as hard as they were and the Rotisserie wings were like chewing rubber and the high salt content is enough to make my head spin. Do real people actually eat here ?",

We got the pineapple cocktail (forgot the name) which was way too sweet! We switched out for a nice red instead.

If you want a burger cooked medium rare which NO ONE DOES, Go here. Best burger in the world especially if your a fan of the medium rare.

In addition to the smaller downstairs with the bar, they also house a larger upstairs with an open kitchen and booths. I was sitting at the bar to the open kitchen and it was fun watching everything come together, not to mention it made ordering easier since you could scope out your options.  The food: hands down the best gnocchi I've ever had! Light and pillowy, paired with picked carrots and duck confit (I know it sounds weird, but it just works!)   The wait: this is definitely an instance in which you're going to want to book a reservation. I was in a party of two and we got kitchen bar seats and it was still about a 30 minute wait. That being said, the host was great about it and got us into bar seats pretty quickly.",

Ordered onion strings which were addictive, batter is crispy and salty (just drooled a little). Wife had a side order of the Mac and Cheese and it was amazing, on a cast iron skillet made in wood burning oven. This place is too 5 sit down lunch in uptown no question.

She asked about pizza on the menu and because he wasn't a fan of pizza, he couldn't stop saying you can get pizza anytime. He kept interrupting her every time she tried to talk. When she said she didn't want something he recommended, he was condescending. I also tried being polite when we got up to leave and tip him for his time and to go as far as telling him we just didn't like the menu for tonight to be nice. He follows that you with a snide remark. Hopefully management sees this so they can act accordingly.",

    "text": "Quick update. Came for a Wednesday lunch, and I ordered the Steak Burger. Last time I came I had their INCREDIBLE Vietnamese Pork sandwich, which my buddy Jeff ordered today (he LOVED it!).   Unfortunately, when I got my burger, I got yet another Depleted Uranium (DU) bun. Well, ok. This time it was Titanium. I showed my waiter the heft of this bun, and I said if I had pirhanna teeth I still wouldn't be able to eat it. Sad part is that I remember getting this hard bun a year or so ago....maybe they kept it that long???  OK, the Waiter and Manager attempted to make this right. They took my DU Burger and put in a new order. Right call. The Manager asked if he could get me something while I waited for my new order. He brought me out some grits with bacon. Sounded yummy. Unfortunately it was average at best. Grits were not fully cooked (or maybe they were just designed to be texturally stiff?). Could have used more flavor...I left the majority of that \"snack\" on the table.  Burger took a long while to come out, but it did, and it was better. Look the bun was softer the second time around....but it's still a dense bun. But I don't understand why this Jim Noble restaurant insists on using HARD BREAD for their burgers? Note to Rooster's Management: USE SOFT BUNS! Try Brioche.....Cowfish uses Brioche buns and they make their burgers ROCK! Nothing like butter and burger....it's a match made in heaven!  So this rating is for their burger. Waiter and Manager tried doing the right thing. And I appreciate that. But using hard buns just don't work for me. Hard to believe since they make such delicious, fresh bread at King's Kitchen. I mean, they have an awesome, soft bun for their Vietnamese Pork sandwich. Why not use that Rooster's for your burger? My mouth (and teeth) would be SO much happier! Yeay.",

We went to the bar since our table wasn't ready and no one had any idea about wines almost felt like I was bothering them. We got seated and quickly a teenager came up to our table with an attitude like AGAIN we were bothering him, he never said hi, I had to say hi. He came up and literally put a bread bowl on our table then poured olive oil in a plate no seasoning no nothing. Apparently u get cold olive oil with your cold bread. How thoughtful of them I think that was all it took but then the bathrooms are very far away from the restaurant I felt just stupid for coming here. All the hype, l just feel stupid waiting for the table then to feel worst about the teenager serving the cold ass bread. I was shocked that the restrooms were so far for such a high end place. I was so disappointed and then I guess the GM realized we were leaving she asked to comp our meal, that in itself told us everything sorry but I just didn't think it was worth it at that point.",

    "text": "Went with another couple which was celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary.  It was special.  The menu has a lot of different offerings.  Quite surprising to us, but a wonderful surprise.  Very nice wine list with variety and many wines by the glass. Service was superb and the plates presented well.  Salads were generous enough for two, so think about that so you can save room for more.  The bar was a full one and cocktails were the norm, so if you want to try something your \"heard about\" or just wanted to experiment, this is the place.  I had the most delicious short rib ever.  It was BIG, tender and so tasty that I almost lost most of it to the other three diners who regretted that they had not ordered it themselves.  Served over mashed potatoes.  Truly yummy.  One of the others ordered the tomato bisque soup and mussels.  So-so was my judgement, with the mussels rather flavorless in a watery tomato liquid.  The assorted mushrooms that I ordered for an appetizer were superb.  Sooooo flavorful and a good portion that went a long way as they were too rich to gobble down with a big spoon.    Wife ordered a special which had those same-o mushrooms and a small balls of pasta which looked like beans but were not.  The pasta was fregola. That meal would have been a good appetizer as well.  Wife took license to steal some of my mushrooms for good measure.  The other couple ordered the special scallops.  We were all rather stunned to see the presentation of four, only four nicely browned scallops plated with some garnish.  Barely an appetizer and not so special.  I passed on taking a taste as the portion would have robbed them of a good bit of their meal.  Dessert was a beautifully obscene coconut cake, but not just cake.  Creme Anglaise and Chantilly cream were artfully layered with the cake, making it necessary to drink strong coffee so you could refresh your palate to eat more. I am not a dessert eater, but giving in to the table that night was well worth reconsidering my passing, no dessert for me attitude.  Shame we did not try what Rooster's is know for, which is their spit-fired roasted chicken and pork.  Next visit.",

I'm glad too as there was some amount of reputation at stake since it was a team lunch and all I was doing ahead of time was raving about Rooster's.  Thankfully, and no surprise, they delivered.  We all started with a cup of tomato basil bisque and right after the first spoonful there were unanimous sounds of delight.  Lunch main dishes around the table ranged various salads, chicken salad sandwich and one special of the day which was catfish tacos.  Everyone was fully happy with what they got.  Service was spot on as well with glasses of tea and water kept full and enough checking in to make sure all was well without being overbearing.  Winner, winner, Roosters dinner.  Err..... lunch. :)",

That being said, we were looking forward to planning a small (8 people) surprise birthday celebration for our friend but the experience was less than celebratory. Most restaurants at least make sure to pay extra attention to the birthday girl/boy but in our case, she was the last to even receive her drink. Many of the girls' waters were never refilled. Considering it was a special occasion, there was no special attention or effort made by the restaurant to help celebrate the birthday girl. Usually a restaurant does a dessert or something, but nothing here. Probably wouldn't tell people to go if they're celebrating. Maybe order and pick up - service is better at home.",

You must be wondering why these are the requirements for this sandwich?  Well let me tell you, the roll with its crease holds the over flowing goodness that's inside. They should have a disclaimer on this overpriced sandwich that states; beware that this sandwich is literally a Po boy b/c its inspired by ppl that thought a Po boy should have as little filling as possible to represent the disenfranchised shrimp lover.   ***fries were good",

Ryan was our server and was very knowledgeable attuned to our dining experience. The cheese selection was amazing and fresh. I chose the short rib which was braised and extremely tender with a flavorful jus. The pan fried corn is a must for a side as it is grilled on the cob then tossed in a pan with some butter and seasoning. My girlfriend got the gnocchi which was pleasantly soft with a delectable tomato sauce. We chose the the hand pie that was filled with seasonal fall fruit and resembles a pop over that is topped with a fresh fruit puree. The flavors were good, but it was a little bready and left some to desire. Overall if you are thinking of going here, do not second guess and make the reservation as you are sure to enjoy.",

Not wanting to blow our budget on an expensive meal, we had to choose a bit carefully, but luckily there were options that interested us.  We started with the house cured duck plate.  Super thin slices of tender, cured duck meat piled up on the plate with a drizzle of olive oil. It's delicate, subtly smoky, and wonderful.  I could have eaten two pounds of it. No, really. Chalk it up to poor impulse control.  For the meal, we decided to order one of their pizzas and a batch of chicken wings, and split everything. The wings were really excellent - smoked/grilled, spicy and absolutely packed with flavor. The pizza (it was an olive oil based mushroom pizza) was a bit less fulfilling. It wasn't particularly bad, but it was a bit light on substance, and the olive oil base was overdone, leaving the pizza feeling too oily as a whole.  The upstairs dining area is dimly lit and attractive, and it feels private in the booth, despite the room's size. Our waitress was great, offering her suggestions and maintaining just the right amount of presence.",

We were given bread & it wasn't warmed up; it kinda tasted like sliced bread from the package tbh. We ordered some dishes to share my FAVORITE dish was the calamari, the meat tasted very fresh & it was just seasoned perfectly! I had the mushroom dish & it was okay. However the other dishes I didn't really enjoy as much because I just felt like everything was way to oversalted and way overpriced for what we got. The salmon for example, it was fresh but we literally got a small piece of salmon that tasted like it's worth only half the price. There was nothing really special about it, same goes for the other dishes. Overall I did enjoy the service and the vibes of the place but I don't think I would be quick to come back anytime soon.",

    "text": "This review is for a drink and what ended up being a short dinner at the bar on a moderately busy Saturday night.  I walk in and sit at the bar just as two people were leaving.  Awesome - no wait!   There are 4 bartenders and a bar back working (or that's what it appeared to be) and were moderately busy.  The hostess drops a menu off to me which was great, good service there.  I ordered an old fashioned from their menu, and I should have known that if it comes back literally 30 seconds after I ordered... it was going to be nothing more than bourbon over ice and an orange/cherry to the bottom.  And yes, that was exactly what it was... not horrible, but so much to be desired there.    I ordered some of their smoked wings, and they came relatively quick. They were decently flavored, but over seasoned. Again, not great and not horrible.  I was planning on ordering a meal, but then observed the bartender being extremely rude to a couple that walked up.  And then another group.  And then the guy next to me pays out his tab, and politely suggested to the bartender in question that he address the attitude and manners (or lack there-of) in talking with patrons. The bartender at this point escalated his attitude towards the gentleman next to me, and I asked for the tab and checked out.  What sucks is that this place (specifically the bar) has so much potential - and the reviews here are mostly the restaurant portion. And the other 3 bartenders were nice (it was apparent there was tension and a bit of awkwardness in the group with that one) - but maybe the guy was just having a bad day, who knows.  Something tells me he is this way all the time.  If management is reading this, he's the guy that taller, thinning hair on top, but of grey mixed in a rough, 3 day beard kind of look - late 30's/early 40's.  Maybe it is time to have a chat with this guy and adjust the attitude a bit.  :)  I'm just a visitor for the weekend, so they won't miss me....",

A few years ago, I had a variation of the meatloaf and it was a bit different- it was more of a loaf (bigger portion) and came with fried onions on top.

The atmosphere is great here and I got a great seat next to the kitchen. The bread basket gave it a hopeful start and looking at the yelp reviews I was sure I couldn't go wrong with the short rib brisket. I was wrong. This was so salty that barely hal way through I decided it was absolutely not worth the calories so I stopped <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Feating.it&s=7385a42d01d18e8458d42dd3adcdd48c0be5f82654d34532e769cb68a1c04f97\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eating.it</a> was so salty I was playing a game of trying to prevent the meat from falling into the salty sauce that glazed the plate. I ordered it with the fingerling potatoes which, although clearly had salt all over it was such a rescue. I had to ask for ketchup and was pretty much devouring the ketchup because I needed something to cut through the salt.  Not sure if I'll be returning- very disappointing.",

We had the calamari as a starter, comes with 2 homemade sauces, was just average. We had the special Brussel sprouts for the side and they were so good. I had the duck breast as my main (see pics) and it was so good. Cooked to perfection and served with a sauce that was so so full of flavor. I strongly recommend the duck!!!   I would give Roosters a 5, but the calamari and the shrimp main course were average.",

We loved the option to choose different meats & cheeses to create your own charcuterie. Each portion is 1 oz so they're pretty small -- just a heads up. We also ordered the mixed olives which were super delicious and a very generous portion.  We ordered the Brussels as an appetizer and oh baby, they were some of the best we've ever had! Served with provolone, bacon, and capers... YAS QUEEN. Hoping to recreate them in our kitchen although I'm sure it'll never be the same.  For our entrees, we had the short rib which is sou vied for 24 hours and YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE ITS AMAZING. Like butta for real. We were blown away. We also ordered the shrimp which were delicious but the highlight was definitely the short rib.   Fantastic experience and would highly recommend this spot.",

It was wonderful. Crispy  thin and hot. Great flavor  We also got soup, salad and roasted beets and gnocchi  The bread was great fresh and warm Tomato soup was delicious and a bowl could have been a whole meal with that bread The gnocchi was fabulous.

I then took a tip from a patron eating at the bar, who shared some of his favorites off the menu with me, and opted to give the scollops and grits a try. I'm a southern foodie at heart, so that was a no brainer for me.   He broke it down for me and told me that everything is a la carte and to expect several plates to arrive. The calamari came out first and wasn't bad, but also want memorable. The scallops and grits came out second, and I couldn't finish them because they were so rich in flavor and so filling it felt impossible! I obviously took those with me to go.   The server suggested the bread pudding for a dessert and I thought, why not? .......Not. Just don't. Do yourself a favor, and pass on the bread pudding. The bread was dry and flavorless, bordering on burnt, and the custard goodness of a great bread pudding was non existent. The ice cream on top of the bread pudding, however, was better than your average scoop of vanilla, so not a complete loss.   There are some dishes that the restaurant executed in a way that'll be hard to top, and some that they failed to execute on period. My suggestion is to come in and try Roosters, but I wouldn't suggest experimenting; go with what is highly recommended by locals/ reviews and I doubt Rooster's will disappoint you!",

We parked in the BoA tower parking deck and it took us a solid 20 minutes to find the restaurant from the parking deck. It isn't self explanatory and we had trouble getting there. When we finally arrive, the service wasn't bad. Our waiter was friendly and answered all questions. They were generally prompt with our requests. However, when it came time for the food, disappointment set in.   I tried the seared scallops with brussel sprouts and the pan fried corn. My bf tried the short ribs & he was also underwhelmed. We felt that the portions were very small. Also, we felt all our food was very heavy on the grease/oil. Though the scallops were pretty okay, the brussel sprouts were drowned in oil. The pan-fried corn ended up being just seasoned/buttery kernels of corn.... my waiter didn't explain this thoroughly. For the price, the portion size and the actual taste - we were both very underwhelmed. The one thing we tried that was absolute perfection was the calamari appetizer, best thing we had to eat all night. The free bread basket was a very nice touch and much appreciated.   Overall, with the exception of the drink I had and the calamari appetizer, I don't know that I care for anything else I tasted.",

The smell upon entry is mouth-watering and even with the occasional menu changes, it seems multiple items always catch my eye!   Service has been great every time even when they are clearly busy and potentially feeling overwhelmed. Beverages are refilled and plates cleared without delay. When the duck is available it is a must! If you visit at lunch and don't mind wanting a nap immediately after you eat the MeatLoaf and its sides are outstanding! It is heavy and thus nap enticing but somehow (thanks to more coffee) I was able to power through the rest of the day!  The atmosphere is a dynamic shift in my opinion when dining upstairs verse the bar and the noise level is a piece of that. If you have a larger group wanting to converse, stick to upstairs at a table.",

Rooster's smells like yummy food before you even walk in, it's similar to walking by Cinnabon. The menu is a la cart and the sides are good for sharing.   I had the chicken wings ($15), they were a good as everyone says they are. The flavor on them is charred with a kick. The serving size is generous too! I took half of them home.   A friend and I both ordered the baby kale Cesar salad and neither of us enjoyed it. Both of us thought it was a stretch to call it a Cesar and ended up getting the Brussels Sprouts.

The pizza I would have like it a little more crispy on the bottom and not so burnt on the edges. I realllyyyyyy wanted to try the Mac and cheese but the waiter forgot to put the order in so that was a little disappointing. But other than that the staff was accommodating and food was good!",

Tonight, just before heading over to see Roger Waters perform The Wall, we stopped in for dinner at Rooster's uptown.  I'm very glad that we did!  The meal was excellent! So, what an evening!!  Great concert preceded by a great dinner!  When we arrived at around 6pm, the bar (downstairs) was already full.  Fortunately, my brother had arrived a little earlier and managed to get a table without a reservation.  Look, don't press the luck too far here - this place is popular and it does fill up!!  So, if you can find time, make the reservation!! The menu is basically the same (or very similar to the menu at Southpark. My brother had one of the specials,  a Tile fish dish.  I decided to try the BBQ Chicken.  For sides, we had beets and another special squash dish.  Everything was excellent!  The BBQ chicken was tender and flavorful!  I would order it again,  for sure.  Actually choosing a side was a little difficult, because they have some great choices available!  I've had the mac-n-cheese and pan-fried corn before - both excellent! One more big plus to note, is that Rooster's has a great beer list with several local craft beers available!  Of course you can get the others, but I really enjoy trying local beers and to have so many choices, is great!  I had the NODA Brewing Company Ramble on Red, and I would recommend that too! The service was excellent!  We had a very friendly, helpful, and professional waiter that never kept us waiting. So, it's nice to know that this fine restaurant now has two locations in Charlotte!  I'll be back - to both, I'm sure!!",

I had requested an IPA and was served an ale made by the same brewery. Thinking that the waitress had misheard the order due to the similar names, I didn't mention it because I don't like to complain. However when the bill came, I was charged for the IPA which was 3$ more. When I tried to explain this to the waitress she became defensive, said she served the IPA and said \"well if you just want it removed I will remove it.\" I said I don't want a free beer, I just want to pay for what I received. The manager (who had come by once before to check on us during the meal) came over and took a glance and whiff at the small amount of beer left in the glass and told me that I certainly had received an ale. She apologized and took that beer, along with my boyfriend's beer off the bill. She apologized and thanked us several more times on our way out. This establishment is obviously well managed, and that's the reason I recommend it.",

    "text": "My husband and I travelled from York, SC to meet friends for a concert Uptown on Thursday evening. One of the couples we were joining made a reservation for six at the Roosters Uptown location.  In the spirit of full disclosure, four of us arrived 15 minutes late to join the third couple at our reserved table. We entered the Bank of America complex on the wrong side and took a scenic tour of several catwalks, escalator banks and retail corridors in our quest to find the restaurant!  We were definitely late, and we accept responsibility for that.  However, a note to Rooster's: (1) If you seat us, you are implying that it is within your professional capacity to serve us in a timely manner.  (2) If it is apparent that you are in the midst of a rush you were inadequately prepared to handle, please alert the patrons arriving 15 minutes late to their reservation that it is in their best interest to dine elsewhere. (3) If your server is so far in the weeds to be unable, in retrospect, to take appetizer orders within the first 1/2 hour of the experience (let alone entree selections), simply be apologetic and bring our checks when they are requested. Snarky, rude servers reflect very poorly on the managerial staff of any establishment.  As far as the actual dining room and the tiny sampling of the menu we accomplished: (1) The ambience is fantastic. In an area surrounded by modern, sleek and minimalist designs, Roosters manages to carve out a tiny niche reminiscent of a converted farmhouse, complete with lowered ceilings, weathered wood tables and beautiful iron chandeliers. The restaurant felt intimate and casual but with an elegant touch. (2) The Skinny Margarita Martini was perfect. Fresh lime pulp added just enough tartness....full flavor, ice cold, and delicious. (3) The beer selection was fairly good and was served very cold. The server offered an excellent suggestion to my husband when his first choice was not available. (4) The bread is hardy, with a nutty flavor - paired with the dipping oil it is a wonderful start to what could have been a rich and tasty dinner. (5) Only negative; the water was strangely metallic and, well...yucky.",

Unfortunately didn't have reservations so our only option was to sit upstairs at the chefs table. This was the best experience and will sit there everytime we go again. Its like being in the middle of hells kitchen only without all the competition and language.  It was an experience to see each address each other as chef, work together and bring amazing food. 3 seats down I believe we had the honor of the head chef/owner (sitting there enjoying food)who checked in with us to make sure everything was up to par.  We started with the cheese and salami pizza which was perfect size to share and tasted wonderful.  We then moved to mac n cheese, chili cauliflower, duck breast and as an added bonus the chef gave us a sampling of their creamy yukon. All were to cooked to perfection and easily one of the best meals I've had in Charlotte. Mac n cheese was creamy, perfect spice on the cauliflower and the duck was cooked to perfection.  We finished the meal with some bread pudding which was also very tasty.  will definitely be heading back soon",

It was basically a plate of just arugula (I love arugula, but it's not something I would pay $16 for a plate of it!). The croutons were clearly old and tasted rancid. We told the server they tasted bad and her explanation was that they were buttermilk cornmeal, but I know the difference between a cornmeal and rancid crouton! The shrimp and grits was super salty and didn't have very much other flavour. I doubt a southerner would approve of them!

They had a horrible situation happen where the kitchen flooded and they had to send us to Roosters. The manager at Kings told us that everything would be taken care of due to the fact we had already waited an hour for our food and now they couldn't serve us. Roosters was about to close so we ran several blocks.   They said they were excepting us. All four of us ordered the Short Ribs which were out of this world fantastic. We had two sides that were ala carte. We enjoyed a bottle of wine as well. Finally with happy tummy's the manager brings us the check. It was the full amount spent... We were quite confused since we were told it would be taken care of. Then the manager offers to take care of the side items. I was quite embarrassed at this point to be asking for the manager to take care of our meal when that had already been promised since the overall experience had taken several hours to even get dinner.   I truly think there was a miscommunication from Kings to Roosters and the manager ended up taking care of it. I was simply very embarrassed to have to ask them to do what they said they were going to do. Roosters was quite a bit more expensive than Kings so we most definitely would not have chosen to take friends here on a double date since it wasn't in the budget.   Overall the food and service was amazing. The situation we had was very rare and uncomfortable. I would absolutely return to Roosters for a nice evening out, that is when I know what I'm getting myself into.",

We shared all of our selections including a roasted beet dish, and a seasonal salad that was a mix of fruit, and heirloom tomatoes, and while we loved it, can't recall all of the ingredients. I ordered the duck breast that was prepared perfectly medium rare with an amazing reduction sauce that our waiter said took a couple days to prepare.  My wife ordered the short ribs that she was thrilled with and a side of their Au Gratin potatoes. Great food at reasonable prices, attentive waiter, and a fun atmosphere centered around the open kitchen surrounded by counter like seating.  Loved Roosters!",

For this type of restaurant you can go to the frozen section of the grocery store and get a better meal. Service was good.  Will give them that.",

From a fantastic daily menu to a wonderful (and reasonably priced) wine list to impeccable service, the entire meal was perfect.  We had the heirloom tomatoes with Mellon and speck to start.  For our dinner we had the five choice charcuterie and three choice cheese platter.  Everything was fantastic.",

    "text": "I go to Rooster's quite often; it's actually one of my favorite restaurants that I love to visit when I'm in Uptown. I typically spend a fair amount when I visit, and make sure to tip well. But my love affair with Rooster's is over. I made a reservation for 2, but forgot I had an extra person with me. But I thought we can probably make this work. However, I overestimated Rooster's. Their response was no, sorry. They didn't even try to accommodate me. It was pretty much bye, very abrupt- quite frankly, It left me insulted, upset, and fighting back tears, and I've never felt that way before at Rooster's, or any other restaurant for that matter. I work at one of the large banks in Uptown and while I always recommended Rooster's as a great place to visit, I will certainly recommend that my colleagues visit other restaurants, restaurants that try to accommodate their customers.",

We got a few apps. Meatballs were a special and were inedible! The bread had 3 pieces in the basket for 5 people. We had entrees from Chicken to steak to the burger. It was all fair at best!! We got many sides including fries, Mac and cheese, asparagus... the sides were fine. All in all it was not horrible but we all left saying we will not return. It was also not crowded and the bar smelled so strong of a cleaning solution we left and had drinks elsewhere.9",

    "text": "***Rooster's specializes in meats roasted and grilled by fire and the end results are satisfying as the kitchen achieves crispy and smoky sears to go with rich and moist meat; Rooster's also has upscale notes in the design of the dining room as well as their non-meat choices like a good variety of cheeses and macaroni and cheese that is not infused with truffle oil like a lot of places but instead topped with a fresh shaving of summer truffle***  Rooster's is a meat and poultry centric restaurant in Downtown Charlotte.  They specialize in their proteins grilled or spit-fire roasted and you can definitely tell fire plays a large role in this restaurant as several of their BBQ meats like pork shoulder reveal a great smokiness while their grilled duck breast combines a charred and crispy skin with a rich, moist and red center.  Of the meats I tried, I liked their duck breast the most.  It was simply prepared and seasoned, but the incredible char they were able to achieve on the outside of the duck breast gave it a great smoky flavor.  The juiciness was also excellent.  It was one of the most well prepared duck breasts I have had to date.  The grilled hanger steak was also good but did stand out compared to great hanger steak preparations I have had at other restaurants.  Rooster's also features an impressive variety of cheeses including good goat cheese and blue cheese choices.  Sides are served a la carte here and their goat cheese with arugula and peaches salad was fine, but the most satisfying side was their macaroni and cheese.  It was creamy but also had a crispy, lasagna-like crust.  For the macaroni and cheese, they also offered an option of summer truffle shaved tableside (at a very reasonable cost) and the summer truffle was quite fragrant and pungent.  Service was very good and friendly.  Prices were not too bad.  At first glance, prices might seem high here since the preparations appear to be so simple, but the quality of proteins is very noticeable as Rooster's meats are well marbled and the high heat from the fire allows the fat to evenly melt, which provides a soft, juicy and very flavorful experience.  Rooster's has a contemporary dark wood dining room with large booths.  The booths are definitely designed for big crowds given that meats and sides here are served a la carte to allow for easy sharing.  Rooster's was the best dining experience I had in my limited stay in Charlotte.  The food was prepared with skill and care and there were enough Southern touches like pimento cheese and pan fried corn to make this restaurant feel unique to the area.  I think Rooster's is definitely a good option for an upscale and satisfying but not too pricey dinner in Downtown Charlotte.  I do not know what the parking situation is in this area.",

I hope we don't have to wait four more years to come back! I ordered the beef short rib, au gratin potatoes and a seasonal greens salad with pear, pecans and a delicious cheese I just cannot place. The vinigarette dressing was amazing and the pear slices had just a hint of cinnamon I think. My husband did the wedge without Roquefort and subbed ranch. The dressing was homemade and he was thrown first by the flavor - dill. Interesting surprise. The bacon was smoked and cubed and very tasty. My daughter had the macaroni and cheese and our waiter thought to ask when we wanted it to arrive - with the salads or entrees. Anyone with kids agrees, this is a nice thought and good way to keep your kiddo happy! My husband got the ribeye medium rare and it came with a potatoes puree and sauteed mushrooms. He was shocked how tender; it nearly fell apart. The mushrooms had a great shallots flavor that enhanced the potatoes. My short rib was very tender, flavorful and perfectly portioned. The au gratin potatoes were delicious but needed just a dash of pepper for my taste. Perfectly timed, our waiter mentioned a dessert that took just a few extra minutes but said it was definitely worth the wait. We shared it - the brown sugar bread pudding with a smear of apple pear jam and a dollop of ice cream. A truly perfect end to a memorable meal.",

As a meat lover, any place that specializes in smoking their own meat and does it well it going to rate highly in my book, but Rooster's shines all around. I've had their wings, roasted chicken, and bbq meatloaf as well as different sides. Their wings and chicken were both really flavorful and perfectly juicy (as I'm sure just about all their meats are), but if you take one thing away from this review - get the bbq meatloaf! It had a great blend of spices, was cooked perfectly, and Rooster's bbq sauce is incredible. It's sweet, spicy, and smoky without having any one of those elements be too strong. I got some on the side with my chicken this past visit, and it made the meal that much better. The staff has also been very friendly, and the open-kitchen concept where you can see the chefs working is pretty interesting.",

We were seated on the first floor and the restaurant was not that busy. The last straw came when we asked for the check and we waited 15 minutes for someone to run our cards. Finally giving up my friend walked to the Epicenter, pulled cash, received change, walked back, and they still not had come back. Meanwhile I was trying to get some attention to no avail.

Stools have a neat curved design, but aren't incredibly comfy. Decent music, good mood lighting.  Food - 4 stars. Had the pork shoulder - very good. Not the best I've ever had, could have been more tender. Vinegar sauce was bomb dot com. Coleslaw light and refreshing. Peas were buttery as could be, which won them points in my book.  Drinks - 3 stars. The selection of various hard liquors was okay at best. Considering the meager selection, I don't really feel like my Basil Hayden neat should have set me back by $12. Beers were much more reasonable and numerous, including many local craft brews. Would have been nice to know the ABV percentages.  To summarize, great place for a date. Nice ambiance will put you in the mood for romance. Just pray to the liquor gods that your date is not a whiskey/gin/vodka connoisseur, as they'll probably be disappointed.   As for me, I'll probably be back because it's right across the street from work and I usually get done at around 10 pm.",

Once we were led upstairs we realized pretty much all the tables were full.  The place stayed pretty busy until we left at around 10.  I really liked the decor and feel, rustic but still modern.  Most of us in the group had been to their other location so we knew pretty much what to expect.  However this time we all agreed that the food was better than we remembered.  I think that is a great sign for a second location that hasn't been open long.    Service was pretty good, they gave us time to order and the food came out pretty quick.  We had been drinking so we were a little loud and slow but it did not phase the staff much.  There were a couple times we needed something and it a look a few minutes to find one of the two people helping our table, but we didn't mind.    All of the food I tried was well seasoned/sauced and cooked nicely.  I started with a special for the day, fried green tomatoes with rock shrimp.  The shrimp tasted fresh and the sauce tied everything together well.  For dinner I had mussels which also tasted fresh and were served with a broth that was real good but I can't remember what was in it.  I also got the opportunity to try the hanger steak which was juicy and accompanied by a tasty sauce, the wings which are always solid, and the dessert given to the birthday girl, a coconut cake which was quickly consumed by everyone.  Can't wait to return.",

I don't mind smaller portions with the a $20+ price tag as long as it's good and filling, which this was both. Great wine pairing recommendation - so all good there. The butterscotch brownie... yeah man. Like that dish is on my list of \"fiend-dom\". The only reason I told them to package it up in a mini-to go box is because I wanted to draw out the experience another day. Yeah man.... that's all I have to say about that (channeling Forest G.)",

I may have misread the menu but salad was OK. My husband ordered a salmon patty special.  He was really happy with it. He found it just spicy enough to give it a nice kick.  I ordered sparkling water and it was tepid.   I expect really cold sparkling water especially for the price. Upon exiting the resturant, I saw some beautiful chicken dishes   I've eaten here with work folks before and I know there are much better dishes that I ordered.  Next time, I will order more substantially.",

As for the food: I ordered 1/4 \"natural\" chicken (which I assume means that it was not the BBQ), dark meat and while it looked beautiful, it was dry. Although it was served with lots of liquid, the meat itself was still chewier than I'd like.  Roasted fingerling pototoes--were tasty Coffee drink after (the one with chocolate liqueur and Bailey's) was just kind of meh--nothing to write home about.",

Then we ordered the coconut cake which was totally dried out.  The manager came by to apologize for the new chef's mistake.  Now I do not expect to get anything free but after the excessive bad service and bad desert, comping the second \"replacement desert\" would have been a gracious gesture.  I am sure we will go back but if we have a repeat experience it will be the last time.",

Start with the pervasive attitude that starts at the front door that is, at best brusque. We didn't have a reservation, and I have no problem eating at the bar, but I have a BIG problem with the hostesses just being so put out about you having the nerve to show up on them and tilt their day.  Better training sets a better tone. Of course it was no better downstairs at the bar. Busy place, but when you sit for five minutes and wait for one of the three bar staff to get around to helping you, and finally have to reach out to them to get them to slow down and deal with you, not a warm and fuzzy feeling. The menu was dynamite, BUT... When the food came out?  My pork chop had been brined so long that half of the salt in the Dead Sea was in it. My grits were tasty but dry and lumpy. The haricots verts were drowned in butter. It was just sloppy cuisine, either executed by a staff not under its chef, or a chef that doesn't really care what the consistency of his dishes is supposed to look like. Once you get the bar staff to slow down, they were really cool people. So TONE is the big thing up front that needs changing, and some love for the food in the back, and this could easily be as good as the Yelpers here seem to think it is.",

I like the decor; the food smells good from the outside (love-hate relationship with that exhaust system... great smell, not so great for my hair and clothes).   I particularly enjoy the bar area. I like the dark tavern feel, but with a touch of class. I also appreciate the chalkboard specials. I like small bites, especially since they are more budget friendly. Last night I stopped in to have a small dinner and ended up with the Beef Heart Bolognese. Yes, you read right... it took a long stare at the board and asking the bartender twice to confirm I was not seeing things. It's not everyday I see the heart organ on a menu. Basically it's Bolognese with chopped heart & liver. The sauce was delicious, and a hint of the distinct liver taste. The best part, however, was the gnocchi. It was fluffy like small pillows. $6 for a small bowl and it was very filling.  I was less impressed by the Rooster Nuggest. It's literally small chicken nuggets, made with their fire roasted chicken. $5 and there were a dozen small pieces. It was perfectly fried, crispy yet not too breaded. Sadly the taste was off... I couldn't even pinpoint exactly what was off. The meat had an odd flavor.    The pomme frites was excellent. The service was ok. They were busy with the after work crowd, and with only 1 real bartender, he wasn't able to pay us much attention.   I have dined upstairs in the dining room before. I also had the pleasure of attending a charity dinner catered by Rooster (it was to fundraise for The King's Kitchen, also founded by Chef Jim Nobles). I have always enjoyed my visits. It's nice enough for special occassion, but you don't feel too stuffy.",

They also make a great Old Fashioned (no sugar cubes but rather with orange and cherry muddled).   Food was great. I had the fried okra, pork shoulder and grits with bacon.

We always order way too much food and somehow find room for dessert afterwards. The bar is rustic without looking shabby, and you can smell their kitchen out on the street before you even get close.   We definitely enjoy the atmosphere in the bar over the restaurant, and this time we even got to talk trash quietly to ourselves about the two people next to us who were clearly having an affair! At least they have good taste in restaurants!   The food is great, the atmosphere is cozy, the service is friendly. I can't wait to go back.",

But for the amount of time to order and when to receive our food was over 35mins. I love our waitress but I can see she's overwhelmed and all over the place. It doesn't seem like they're staffed. They're staffed enough buss boys and assisting waitresses but the actual waitresses was truly under staff. It took forever to get our food. She couldn't get to us fast enough to fill our waters and my coffee. I would think they know better for a Saturday night!  Now food.. I can't complain in that Dept. When it finally arrive which is after 9:20pm. I was starving at this point was beyond yummy. I ordered the Hanger steak (medium well) perfect seated crust! The Mac and cheese was comforting. And their greens hit the spot.  After dessert, we can't track her down for like 15mins to get the checks. We didn't leave the restaurant til way after 10:30pm when we're anticipating a 2hrs dinner event!",

    "text": "This place has been on my list for months and I'm sad to say that it did not live up to my expectations.  First off, the space is incredibly beautiful with vintage wood, a beautiful open downstairs and bar, with the quaint, cozy, intimate restaurant setting situated upstairs. We had two waiters come up to us and pour us water and serve us bread without saying a word. They poured the water and walked away. I had to ask what the server's name was, as I thought he was our restaurant server, and then he mumbled something about \"weed.\" The second server brought bread to our table but said nothing. I was shocked at the lack of personal touch to this point.  Once we met our actual server for the night, I posed a few questions about food options on the menu. The server wasn't very helpful and just said everything I asked about was \"excellent.\" He wasn't able to describe flavors or what makes it excellent, which made my ordering decision very difficult. We started with a glass of wine and craft beer. I did enjoy the variety of wines and beers on their list. We skipped the appetizer and I went with the seasonal flounder, while my husband ordered the pork chop. By the way, sides are a la carte. I'm actually not a fan of this at all. I like dishes that choose sides that complement the flavors of the dish. It looks awkward serving an entree, such as a piece of fish or meat, on a large plate all by itself. That's just my opinion, but I don't prefer it. I ordered the grilled beets while my husband ordered the mac n cheese. The flounder was probably one of the least memorable fishes I've ordered. I was disappointed in it's lack of flavor and seasonings for $30.00. I wasn't impressed. My husband's pork chop was better. The mac n cheese was my favorite part of the meal and came with a crusted layer of cheese on top, which was to die for.  We enjoyed the pace of our meal, but the service was just eh, overall.   I'm rather disappointed in the overall experience after having high expectations for this restaurant.",

There's no music and it's you with 3 other tables. Maybe that's where they place the bad kids ;-)   Anyways, the food has been pretty good. I've had the mushroom pizza (awesome), the assorted mushrooms (guess I love mushrooms), the Mac and cheese (yummy in my tummy) and the steak burger (jaw dropping). My favorite has been the steak burger, which my husband and I split.  It was cooked to perfection and had the best flavor. Plus it was only $13 and came with the side. FYI the onion rings are bomb! I haven't tried the chicken yet (which I think is the signature item), so I'll above to try it next time.   My only drawback to Roosters besides our seating arrangement is that they are sometimes out of items because it's farm to table. When they are out- they are out. Last time I was there they were out of the scalloped potatoes, asparagus and broccoli. I was really craving the potatoes which was a let down.",

Well she graciously took the wings off our bill. We were pleasantly surprised. With this type of service and concern we will certainly come back. We just won't order the smoked wings again.

We started with the olive bowl which was splendid, the purple ones are the best! I ordered the steak, with potatoes au gratin and OMG they were heavenly. The steak had a great sear, great flavor and was cooked a perfect medium! My husband got the burger which he said was divine! I also got a really nice glass of wine, everything was just perfect.

    "text": "Rooster's Uptown is the first restaurant I tried in Uptown Charlotte after moving to the area. It is in the heart of Uptown within walking distance from all the major hotels, theaters and nightlife. My boyfriend and I went on a Wednesday night around 5:30 and it was PACKED. Definitely a good sign...when we told the hostess we were there without a reservation she gave an apparent sign of distress, but with a little walkie-talkie magic (the place is huge) we were able to get in without a wait. The ambience was very lovely, warm and romantic, or would have been if it weren't for that night's crowd of mostly teenage girls and their mothers boasting about who camped out outside of the Four Seasons the longest waiting for a glimpse of Selena Gomez.   My boyfriend and I ordered the charcuterie plate to start (obviously, we are Millennials after all) and were able to chose two cheeses and three meats. The waiter knew an incredible amount about the menu and was able to make recommendations for our selections. The plate also came with crusty bread, yummy house-made pickles, and a huge amount of ridiculously pungent mustard, the smell of which was nauseating (I hate mustard). I know it is a matter of preference, but in my opinion no charcuterie plate can be complete without a sweeter element...chutney, jam, honey, fruit...whatever tickles your fancy. By failing to have a sweet component I believe the charcuterie plate was lacking. Our waiter was very quick to bring me honey though when I mentioned this comment.  Rooster's Uptown's menu provided fresh, local ingredients, some prepared in creative ways I hadn't seen before and some offered in the same trendy way as all the menus of the \"upscale Southern\" restaurants now ubiquitous in Charlotte.  My boyfriend ordered the filet which was cooked perfectly, but the beans underneath were extremely oversalted (I'm guessing over-reduced). My polenta cakes with grated Parmesan were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside...just heavenly. The mac-and-cheese recommended by our server, with chevre (goat cheese) as the secret ingredient was sinfully good and even better reheated the next day!   Rooster's Uptown was only given four stars because of the steep price and my boyfriend's overly cooked meat and improperly seasoned . The meal for the two of us, including gratuity, was $135 and we did not drink ANY alcohol. Even though the meal was AWESOME, I have had better meals for a fraction of that price.  I would recommend Rooster's Uptown for a girls' night or before catching a play. The wine list is extremely extensive and the a la carte menu is perfect for sharing. Rooster's will have something to please everyone.",

I don't generally bother writing restaurant reviews, but upon recently learning that Jim Noble--the owner of Rooster's--actively supports the far-right, discriminatory group Alliance Defending Freedom, I felt I couldn't remain silent. Guess what? You have the freedom to spend your money at any variety of restaurants in Charlotte that have better food and are owned by decent humans who operate their businesses ethically. If you care about not supporting a bigot, then there are plenty of other wonderful restaurants to patronize. I'll never set foot in another Jim Noble establishment* again.    * King's Kitchen, Rooster's, and the soon to open Noble Smoke",

I love the atmosphere of the place, everyone is so friendly. I found the menu to be quite confusing, and the everything is overpriced for what you get. We ordered a TON of food so I'll break it down for you:  First off, everything is overly salted. The best thing we got was the Fried Calamari as a starter. It was too salty though, but very succulent! The salmon was too blackened, making it very dry. The smoked wings, although good, were also very salty. The mushroom fregola is delicious! One of my faves, for I have never eaten anything like it. And the mushrooms are huge which I loved. The pei mussels were very good as well! The sauce it was in was a little bit watery, if it were thicker, it would've paired great with the bread it comes with. The mac and cheese was too bland. The cheese was not very strong, and the sauce was noticeably runny. Some items were just a hit or miss and I did not leave with a full stomach. I didn't love anything, but the service was impeccable. Our waiter, Grant, was great!",

After a short walk (less than a block) from our hotel we arrived at the restaurant.  Since we had reservations, we were immediately taken to our table.  Table location was kind of funny, upstairs and outside in an area beside the stairs.  We had multiple wait staff due to group size.  I found all of them to be both friendly and informative.  We ordered multiple appetizers and drinks.  One of the appetizers was a meat and cheese sampler that was awesome.  I ordered a flatiron steak and scalloped potatoes.  I have to say, that due to the size of the side, I had to share.  I think everybody agreed that the potatoes were the hit of the meal.    The steak was small but prepared well.  I like my steak to be more flavorful than what I was served.  I would probably order something else if returning.  Would I return?  Without a doubt.  We had a great time and I would like a second helping of those potatoes:-)",

Got one of the cocktails too... pretty good.

The restaurant has a slightly upscale feel but no need to wear a suit to dinner. The taxidermy on the wall and the open kitchen made the atmosphere very entertaining. As a group we ordered several sides and all of them were great and easy to share. I got the pork belly which was just added to the menu and it was unbelievably good. The highlight of the dish though was the sweet potato puree. The BBQ chicken was also a great choice if you are looking for something with more traditional southern roots. One of our party member ordered the hanger streak and it was unevenly cooked. That is the only negative I have for our time there. Service was great and we left full and happy.",

My experience with the bartenders was not impressive at all and I was not pleased with their services.  After enjoying my wine with my friend who met me there we tabbed out and went to our table. Upstairs was gorgeous I was thinking to myself we should have just come up here! We were seated a a round booth and I shared with the girls what took place downstairs. As I stepped away to use the restroom, I noticed a gentleman and to my surprise he was an old coworker {it's been 10+ years} who's now the manager of this Roosters!{Hey Bo!} I did inform him of what took place and he sincerely apologized and mentioned that I would be addressed immediately. Which it was and from there on our night went from sour to remarkable and I'm so glad it did. I did not want my first experience at Roosters to be this way and Bo truly turned things around. And sweet Sarah such an amazing and friendly server. We ate like little hungry women and laughed endlessly.

No regular tables available, so we settled for the kitchen bar (which is great for two people who want to see how food is made!).  We split the roast chicken, the beef short ribs, and the beets.  Beef short rob was great - fell right off the bone!  The chicken was nice and tender (we got dark meat), and the BBQ dipping sauce was mind-blowingly awesome (LOVED the chili kick it had).  Beets were OK - more my girlfriends thing than mine.  Would definitely come back and try roosters again!",

The atmosphere was akin to Hells Kitchen, except for the loud screaming, crying or expletives with a British accent. Orders came in and everyone worked seamlessly to put out hot, delicious goodness.   I had the seared scallops with wilted spinach and my husband got one of the nights specials - flounder. Now usually flounder doesn't make for a very thrilling dining experience, but this one knocked his knickers off. My scallops were buttery rounds of delightfulness that made me actually pause and enjoy each bite ... much unlike a normal American eater. To top it off, our server was Johnny on the spot with the check so we could get to our show on time. Outstanding!",

We absolutely loved it,  though I admit nothing on the dessert menu caught our fancy.   Service was great too.  My friend ended up not being crazy about the drink she ordered and very politely asked our server to switch. This can be a sticky situation because it all depends on restaurant policy if they will do it. But our server very graciously brought a different drink and didn't charge for the first. While I would never assume to not pay, it's very nice when they make this customary gesture. Just good service and fantastic food.",

(That has more to do with Charlotte, not Rooster's, though we did love the restaurant.) We finally moved here a few days ago and I am looking forward to going back.   The night we went, there were four of us and I believe Madonna was in town at the arena. We were told that we wouldn't likely get a table anywhere in town if we didn't have reservations. We ended up at Rooster's and sat at the chef's table. We could not have had a better experience and I would strongly recommend sitting up there if it's a busy night and you want a low-key dining experience.  One quick question to all the people saying, \"the portions were too small\": You do know that this place is served as small plates, right? They are supposed to be small! And typically at restaurants that offer small plates, the more premium items tend to be a little small. This should not be a knock on Rooster's specifically, but more on the way small plates are done in this country.  What I do remember was that all of the food was fantastic and the drinks were great. We had an absolute blast and like I said, we'll be back soon now that we live here!",

Needless to say we hopped over to Rooster's for dinner....maybe it's that I had my mind set on Cowfish...or maybe Rooster's really just isn't that good - but I was not satisfied with the food.  The atmosphere is awesome - the smell when you walk in is great! Our serve was pretty helpful and friendly. They portion sizes they claim to be large are actually rather average. Everything is served a la carte - still not big enough portions to share if that's what you were thinking.  I got the arugula salad which was very basic - greens, cheese, apples, dressing - nothing too impressive. The mac and cheese was just okay. The BBQ sauce is pretty sweet. Natural chicken was kind of dry.",

    "text": "Everything about this experience was A++. Our server was fantastic (I forgot to get her name) and everything we tasted was better than the last. We started the meal with a few glasses of wine and a plate of fried calamari. I could have calamari once a day for the rest of my life and die happily so i am somewhat of a calamari snob. This calamari was some of the absolute best i have ever had. My only complaint about it is the tentacles are always my favorite part and our plate didn't have any. The calamari comes with Parmesan cheese on top and two sauces, marinara and a sauce similar to yum yum sauce you get at hibachi restaurants.  It also had two fried lemon slices as well. I never would have thought to deep fry lemon slices, but it was a perfect pairing for the calamari. We decided to get three entrees and three sides and to split them all since everything at Rooster's is a-la-carte. Will ordering our waitress suggested that we get the pizza first, did i mention how awesome she was, and helped us pick our other entrees and sides. So we got the Mushrooms and Campo de Montalban Pizza first. It was perfectly burnt and completely fantastic. It only had olive oil  as a sauce and this was perfect complement to the mushrooms.  For our main entrees we got the Seared Sea Scallops and the Beef Short Ribs. I normally am hesitant about short ribs because i've had some bad experiences with it but my dad was insistent and our waitress told us that it was roasted for 4 days. I gave in and i'm very happy i did. The Beef Short Rib was so tender it fell apart on your fork. The Scallops were also seared beautifully. They had the perfect golden color and were so deliciously buttery. The sides we got were the Pan Fried Corn, the Au Gratin Potatoes, and the Mac and Cheese. (we really love cheese) The corn was great and a step above what you think it would be. It is not overly buttery and is seasons perfectly. The Au Gratin Potatoes were again recommended by our waitress and we were grateful for that. They were perfectly cheesy but not overwhelming.  We decided on the Mac and Cheese because i keep seeing it pop up on reviews on Yelp. It did not disappoint. It had a crust and that melded seamlessly with the creaminess of the mac and cheese. We finished off with the meal with a complimentary Apple Pie A La Mode since were celebrating my dad's birthday. The pie was warm and was filled with very thinly sliced apples. Even though i was stuffed beyond belief and told myself i was only going to have one bite i couldn't help but eat at least a third of it. It was great! Everything about it tasted fresh and completely homemade. This is a restaurant i would have absolutely no qualms about recommending Rooster's Uptown to anyone.",

We had to get someone's attention to ask if we should seat ourselves.  Service was pretty lackluster start to finish including some confusion over the 1/2 sandwich and soup combo.  I got the Pimento Cheese Sandwich with fried corn.  The Pimento Cheese was served on two big slices of well-buttered bread.  The bread slices were SOO thick that the pimento cheese got lost.  I just wanted more Pimento cheese.   Now the Fried Corn was actually awesome.  Salty and crispy.  YUM.  I wanted a lot more of that.  The restaurant itself is very warm and comfortable in its design and decor.  I'd go back but I would probably try other places in Uptown first.",

As soon as we got close to Roosters we could smell the woo-fire on the street. We were instantly glad we had carried on.  The atmosphere downstairs was cozy and inviting. They took us upstairs to seat is and I was afraid the second level would lose some of the charm, but it did not. In fact, the open kitchen is the feature of the second floor. The atmosphere and our server were absolutely fantastic.   My wife had the Hangar Steak and Au Gratin potatoes. The steak was good, but the real star were her potatoes. We highly recommend!  I decided to try a few things, so I got the Duck Wings (daily special), the Beef Summer Sausage, and the Fire Roasted Beets. All were good, but my favorite were the beets. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. If you like beets, get these.",

It was packed so we shared those community-ish tables with other diners.  We ordered our food and waited and waited and waited.  We got our drinks...and waited some more.  Server came by and asked, \"Are you guys ready for your check?\"  Kinda confusing, because we never got had our food in the first place.  She apologized profusely and the manager came by to apologize.  They were able to fire up our food relatively quick and gave us a discount.  They apologized a lot.   The food was pretty good.  I had the turkey-bacon sandwich and it was well-priced and tasted good.  Turkey was not dry at all and the bacon had enough flavor to complement.  Pomme frites on the side were a bit salty, but I think everything is salty.  Bosses' got salads, spaghetti, and some sides which they said were all very good food.  Pan-fried corn was a good one.  Overall, food is good, experience tarnished by mistake in service.  Decent recovery, but honestly, I expected lunch to be comp'ed entirely.  Just the egregious nature of the mistake calls for free lunch, at least from my point of view.  Apologies were nice.  Will I come here again? Eh, maybe not for lunch bc I'm not looking to have a European lunch that drags on for X hours.  dmo out.",

Scallops were very small for the price but we're perfectly cooked. Roasted chicken was moist. Great scalloped potatoes and Mac n cheese.",

    "text": "Simply an amazing dining experience.   The first floor is mainly a bar area with high tops, and the second floor is the actually dining space with an open kitchen. The lighting was soft, romantic, with classy fixtures, great place for a date!   I ordered a quarter dark-meat chicken with nature flavoring, and a butter wilted spinach on the side. The spinach was rich in flavor, and it just melted in your mouth, so good! The chicken, to my surprise, was very flavorful and juicy. I guess that's the beauty of a wood-fired kitchen!   My girlfriend ordered a steak burger with pomme frites (aka French fries). She ordered the steak burger medium well and it was cooked to perfection. The sauce came with the burger was spicy, almost tasted like wasabi in flavor. The fries had some sort of special house seasoning that took it to the next level.   For desert, we shared a toasted coconut gelato, and it came with a very soft sugar cookie. The gelato had a mango flavor that blended in very well with the roasted coconut, and the cookie was soft and a wonderful addition both in presentation and in taste.   Last but not least, absolutely great service! Please do yourself a favor and treat yourself at Rooster.",

    "text": "Decent meal after a show. The half BBQ chicken was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The sides of spinach, corn, and butter beans were all pitch perfect.  Washed down with a decent IPA beer and it was overall a great meal.     Considering the quality of ingredients, the location, ambiance, and service, the price seemed in line with other restaurants at this quality level.   If you're seeing a show at the Belk Theater, this is a decent option that is close, has a varied menu, and isn't too pretentious.",

    "text": "First time there... will NOT be my last.  Hostess Wah was WAHNDERFUL!  I was there with my wife and 3 year old. Appeared to be a bar crowd and we almost left... SO HAPPY that we did not. Wah explained that there was another floor and the wait would be 20-45 unless we sat at the Chef's counter.  We chose the Chef's counter. I was knocked out! The service was amazing! Lauren was our waitress. She knew the selection like the back of her hand.  Chef Cody was a delight to speak with when he approached us (I know better than to bother/distract).  He recommended the cheese sampler with some great local cheeses.  When asked between three entrees, Lauren recommended the duck... IT WAS SO DELICIOUS!!! The meat and sauce were a great combination. The duck was tender and the sauce was a bbq type flavor, but it was not overpowering. Chef Jake and Chef Cody and their crew did an amazing job.  AGAIN, their service was impeccable! I truly believe they were trying to sneak up to refill my drinks. I cannot explain two of the refills.  Their teamwork is something to be modeled by every business concerned with customer service. Manager Tammy, Treseon, and several more of the staff checked on us as if we were the only ones there... they were full!  We could not have been happier!!! Thank you!",

You can find almost anything in Bank of America Center  Really like the open kitchen concept. You can watch your food being made...to a point  Make sure you have plenty of $$ to cover the bill.
