Let's just say it has something to do with the proximity to the Airport and a friend who runs me over to this place between intentionally scheduled long layovers... so we can see each other for a few minutes and eat here.  I believe I've hit the five meal mark at Marias in the past year... every time tasty. Every time good service... and that hug on New Year's day from our favorite server was just one component of a great getaway. I've taken quite a liking to this place. The food's pretty darned good, the margaritas just what you need before take-off and the staff? Awesome.  It's one of those small family owned places I seek when I want great Mexican food. Kudos to my friend for turning me on to this place - I really love coming here.  PS: DO NOT EXPECT UPSCALE IN ANY WAY. Kick back.",

I have to disagree with Julia S. in saying it is packing with gringos. My friend and I were the extreme minority in this case. For the first time I felt embarrassed that I didn't speak Spanish, because every other patron in the restaurant did.  That being said, had an enchilada, burrito, some tacos, and everything was incredible. Tasted very fresh, chips were good, but the salsa did leave something to be desired.   Can't wait to return and try some other things on the menu!",

I think for a beer and an entree it was like $9.  There a ton of options for anyone. Its a small quiet place with nothing to exciting in terms of decorating, but dont worry about that.

Very extensive menu, including mole in a couple of dishes. And endless options - can get just about anything a la carte, if you don't want the rice & beans. But both the rice and beans are more flavorful than any I've had at other Mexican places, so you may want to stick with them. The horchata is good, as someone else said. We'll definitely return and try other items.",

Previous reviews had me skeptical about eating here , but a random conversation about favorite restaurants with people we met at Flying Biscuit pushed me over the edge.  To clear things up, this place is not nasty at all.  Its nicer than I remember it which says a lot for an old building at the corner of South B and Tyvola.  Very friendly and happy to be there staff.  The chips were ok, could have been better, salsa was fine.  My wife is the cheese dip queen and it passed her standards.  What I liked most about this place was that the menu had both more traditional dishes and a large Tex-Mex combos section as well.  I had carnitas while my wife had the 2 enchilada 1 taco combo.  So I got to try both worlds (even though I lean towards the traditional I got love for a cheese enchilada!).  My carnitas were flavorful and well cooked.  The meat had a little more fat than I liked, but I simply picked around it.  And I'm sure that the fat is where the flavor came from.  The meat was served covered with grilled onions that enhanced the flavor further.  The chicken taco from the combination dinner was really good - the chicken was shredded and juicy.  Cheese and chicken enchiladas were both solid.  I won't be bringing my parents or banker here, but my wife and I will be back soon.  Next time I will be getting the chilequilles.",

My tacos al carbon was rubbery meat in stale flour tortillas. No queso fresco, no onions, no cilantro. The refried beans looked unappealing and still had the tinny taste of the can. My rice was so hard I could have put it in a bag and resold it at the store.  My roommate got a combo of a tostada, beef taco, and a Mexican stew burrito. There was sauce from the burrito everywhere that made everything else a soggy mess. He also said that it had no real flavor.  The bf ordered.the chicken fajita taco salad. Instead he was given a regular chicken taco salad. It was also so soggy that it fell apart on first contact with a fork.  Maria's has also expanded the menu and it doesn't do them any favors. It is the same fare you can find at any hole in the wall and none of it is authentic. Another strike against them is that they are now charging for soda refills. This I could understand if they were doling out individual cans but they aren't. So it now costs 2.25 for your first glass and a dollar every glass after that.  We will no longer be frequenting Maria's.",

The service is always good and they have solid menu choices.  The whole place is very similar to any other middle of the road Mexican joint you've been to.  My suggestion is go in without any real high expectations and you'll be fine.",

    "text": "This place is pretty good for an $8 plate of 2 tacos with rice and beans. The meat was a little too salty, as was the rice...but the refried beans were home made, and not out of a can or out of a package. The avocado was fresh in the guacamole--however it was only smashed avocado: no seasoning, no jalapeno, no garlic, onion or tomato. Chips were fresh and hot. My daughter had Maria's special which was a taco, chalupa (tostada), enchilada, tamale and relleno (just some deep fried ground beef and cheese). The sauce on the tamale was cloaento hot dog chili....but the mole on the enchilada was home made. The tostada was perfect.   The service was great...our waitress was very personable and helped me find their hottest sauce--the Diablo sauce. It had a little spice to it. :-)  For someone who comes from New Mexico, this was as close to \"home\" as I have seen yet! Now they just need some red and green chile!!",

The sopapilla dessert for a little over $1, a quick little bite, is a perfect ending.  This place also seems popular with \"boys\" if you know what I mean.  They always find the cool places first!",

From my experience, I am going to have to rate Maria's as average.      The Atmosphere -- After reading a previous critic review, I can see that it indeed, was formerly an Arthur Treachers, lamp post signage and all. Walking in, you're greeted with bright colors, and faux leather lined booths. I have to say, as a word of warning, be careful not to sit too fast, as the benches are a bit soggy and you'll drop with a thump onto the wood below.      The Menu -- The one thing that I can really note about this menu is that it's big. Really big. There's a lot on it, with all of the food that non-spanish people have come to expect from Mexican food. Everything involves cheese, sour cream, or some kind of sauce. Not that it's bad, in fact it's exactly what most people have come to expect from Mexican.",

I should have read Julia's review prior to going because that is exactly how I felt about this place.  This place is a hole in the wall.  Its access is difficult due to the proximity to Tyvola road.  It looks like this place is in an old Arthur Treacher's restaurant.    Like most mexican places,  the standard chips and salsa arrived upon entering.  The chips were crisp and unsalted.  The salsa was ok...nothing exceptional.  The pico arrived later in my meal and it was tasteless except for a little spice.  The tomatoes looked like they were once frozen.  The service was decent except for My server recommending a burrito saying ti was really good.   Well that's where she was wrong.   The burrito was huge and smothered with queso.  It was the only thing on the plate and it was completely unappetizing.  It was filled with chunks of chicken, grilled peppers and onions and rice and beans. The was no real flavor to this and the primary flavor in this dish was the smothering queso.    It would have been nice if there was some color to the plate.  Sorry, but service alone isn't enough to save this from a 2 star review.",

I found that with Maria's Mexican Restaurant. It certainly wasn't fancy on the outside, which is honestly why I hesitated to try it. However it is brightly colored, easy to find, and is cozy and casual inside. I have been there twice now, once as an early lunch and another time as a late lunch/early dinner. The first tine I got the burrito and enchilada lunch combo and the second tome I got the larger dinner combo of this with included rice and beans. Both times I got good food fast although the service was much better during the first visit (early lunch). She was very attentive and personal and everything was just right. At the later time, on a Friday between lunch and dinner, my friend and I hate to wait awhile before anyone even noticed we were there to be seated and, although our sever was nice, she had to be reminded several times of certain things about our order. Although everything eventually came together to complete our order, it took more persistence than it should have but the order was right in the end....and it was good! Will go back again definitely because I know every place is hit and miss when it comes to service. As long as the food is consistently good I will keep coming back!",

We then ordered the guacamole. DELICIOUS! They made sure or chips were never empty and they were warm and crispy everytime they came out. Of course we had to order margaritas!!! ordered the large and she gave us the extra that was left over. Nice little surprise! WINNING! I ordered the fajita nachos and my friend ordered the chimichunga. We both cleaned our plates. I would definitely come back here again.",

Though expecting an everyday Tex-mex restaurant, it had three of my favorite dishes, prepared as well as I've had anywhere. I ordered a Chile Relleno, Chile Poblanos, and a tamale. The  Chili Relleno was stuffed with a very finely ground nicely spiced beef mixed with cheese and then deep-fried. The chili poblano was large, filled with nice gooey cheese, topped with a tomato-based sauce and more melted cheese. The chili itself had some nice heat to it. The tamale had spiced chicken inside the steamed masa coating, all sauced with what could best be called something akin to a chicken gravy. It was really good. It was all really good. As for the rest of the experience, We were served warm chips and salsa when we sat down... The salsa had some real kick to it, which is always appreciated. The decor was maybe a little dated but clean and cheery. The service was prompt, the server was friendly,  knowledgeable and eager to please.Maria's easily earns four stars and a return trip.",

I do not recommend this place. There are better options.   From the outside the restaurant does not seem well kept but it wasn't too bad inside. Seemed like a typical Mexican restaurant. Nothing seemed dirty or messy.   Service was excellent. The server was quick, kind, and spoke but English and Spanish.   The food unfortunately was disappointing. It started out positive as the chips were warm and the salsa wasn't bad. After that it was all down hill. The enchiladas were not bad, but not great. Pretty average. The rice and beans were a bit salty but not terrible. The chile relleno however, was not edible. One bite and it was a no go. Complete freezer burn ruined the food.",

    "text": "If there was a Mexican restaurant version of Beyonce's Beyhive, I would most definitely be in it because this place CONSISTENTLY snatches me by my scalp and delivers quality food and service repeatedly. I have brought my friends, family, coworkers, and even an ex-bestfriend who cursed my birthday here and 100% of people agree that MARIA'S IS TOP NOTCH!  First off, let me start by saying that the waitress, Elaine is unmatched with her level of service, professionalism, humor, and friendliness. She should honestly teach a class on how to be a good waitress. She will never get less than 30% tip with me. Elaine, if you read this, you are already invited to my wedding. I have never had a drink go unfilled. The chips come just as fast as they go. Jesus Christ, I can go on and on about how vital she is to Maria's. Not to take away from the other wait staff, but she has made an incredible impact on me as a customer, as well as my family and friends.   Now, my friend and I were celebrating getting new jobs and moving further up in adulthood so we wanted to ball out on some Maria's with mi Tia, Elaine. Since it was a special occasion, we decided we wanted some drinks! We got medium strawberry margaritas and my Lord... we were SAUCED after ONE! You couldn't even taste the alcohol, but trust me, you could feel it!  Lastly, onto the food, I have gotten other things, which have always been delicious, but my go to meal is Chicken Nachos with a side of rice & pico de gallo. Y'all the food is so good, I had to pull Auntie Elaine to the side one day and ask her how they get the food so consistently immaculate and she told me that the food is made fresh every single day. They don't reuse ingredients and don't keep leftovers.   Talk. About. Quality.  When I hit it big, Maria's is getting a huge investment and Elaine is getting a G Wagon & an edible arrangement. PERIOD!  P.S. Elaine, be on the look out for those wedding invitations. Based on the current state of my dating life, you'll be waiting a while, but if you keep it up, I might rent Maria's out and just jump the broom there!   If you read this and decide you want to go, show Elaine my photo and tell her I sent you!   As a matter of fact, let me call in an order now!",

While it can be considered a hole in the wall, you will find a casual yet pretty lively and welcoming environment Inside.  As soon as you walk in, you're welcomed by their friendly wait staff, who doesn't have much turn over.  In fact, they recognize regulars and often greet them with hugs.  The aroma of delicious Mexican food will hit you as soon as you walk in along with Spanish music playing, perhaps Salsa Music, perhaps Reggaeton (Spanish Hip hop).     Plenty of seating is available whether it be booths or smaller tables and chairs   They offer great daily specials for food and adult beverages.   Your food is sure to come out quick, piping hot, and will satisfy your taste buds without breaking the budget.",

Not that any of that was authentic Mexican (apart from the tamales) but the sauces were excellent, particularly the mole sauce.  They have a separate menu for vegan diners only which is what attracted our dinner guests. The veggie tamales were beautifully prepared . The chips and salsa were just okay.  Service was friendly and attentive. They had a respectable 97 sanitary rating in spite of the fact that it is some what run down, as the building is quite old. In fact, those long time Charlotteans like me may recall this location being occupied by El Cancun over 30 years ago. I look forward to returning.",

There's a lunch specials menu available every day, Monday-Friday 11am-3pm, Saturday & Sunday noon-3pm. They range in price from $3.99-$8.95. My latest trip here I got lunch #2 (burrito and taco, $5.50). I did beef for the burrito and chicken for the taco. Both were good. I also ordered a chile relleno. Their take on it is a deep fried ball of dough filled with ground beef. It was okay, but I wouldn't order that again.  It's not fancy. It's kind of divey, but don't let the appearance fool you. The food is good and fairly inexpensive. Worth a trip if you're in this area and craving some Mexican eats.",

It seemed like the girl was being trained because she seemed confused and I would hear someone in the back correcting her. I didn't say anything because we all got to start somewhere. I get my bill and I am charged a togo fee for each individual item and on top of that when I arrived back to work my whole order is wrong they gave me regular tacos with cilantro. I called just to let them know my order is wrong because I do not have enough time to go back out there to get it changed.

Learn from me - some of the BEST places might not look that great on the outside.Try them anyway - you might be pleasantly surprised!    My friend and I stopped in for lunch and margaritas. I ordered a strawberry margarita and it was nice and strong! Not to mention, our waitress brought us the extra margarita because she didn't want it to go to waste. That's what I call top notch service. It's the little extras that add up to an overall really great experience.   For lunch, I ordered the chimichangas which comes with rice and all the toppings. First, they won me over because you get TWO chimichangas. Second the food was hot and fresh. It was absolutely delicious. Crispy fried goodness with a lot of filling.I was soooo full when I left.    I really enjoyed the food! I And the service was great too. I will absolutely come back!",

There are 6 other tables in the restaraunt. We received a very small amount of queso for the price, and it came out *cold*. We are finally now receiving our meal 35 minutes into waiting *after* seating, and the waitress has no idea who had what at the table, having to refer to our ticket multiple times just to figure out. As I've just been informed, part of our order wasn't even made, so I am no currently waiting even longer. Margaritas weren't even cold.   This place has terrible service and I only have two regrets. 1.) I wasted my cinco de drinko in a place like this, and 2.) I can't give zero stars.  Never coming back here again! STAY AWAY!",
