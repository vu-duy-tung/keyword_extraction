The appeal has lost its luster to me personally because I have been there pretty often when I use to work on that side of town but it's still a great place for food and great quality food at that.     The service is always solid and I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal.  Lettuce wraps, seared ahi tuna and low mein meals really do the trick for me.  Parking is somewhat of a challenge here but you can always valet if you feel like it.  I suggest it really.",

It used to be one of my favorites...I remember going to a conference and I ate at the PF Chang's across the street from my hotel every day.   This last time there was pure disappointment. From the quality of the food, to the service, to the taste it was as if I was at some cheap fast food joint. Each dish tasted like it had the same sauce as a base. It was way too salty! Since when did they start rationing out their rice? We got a very tiny portion of rice and we had to keep asking for more to soak up the salty sauce on the dish. Blah. The service was super slow to greet us at the table and to bring us what we needed. Made for a very unenjoyable experience.   Blah...and I'm sad that it wasn't better.",

    "text": "Can't give 0 stars... So it's Mother's Day and we did not have a reservation. The wait time quote was an hour 20 minutes. They sat us in an hour 45 minutes - not bad! I expected to wait 2 hours so technically they were early! So far so good. Until we got to our table. They had no high chairs so we had to wait. Luckily a guy (I think he was another waiter, not ours) hunted one down for us right away. Our waiter took our drink order and I ordered food for our 20 month old with our drinks. I asked for the toddler food right away. He came back with our drinks and we ordered 2 appetizers and 3 entrees - my husband told the waiter he could bring it all together. He said the appetizers and kids meal would be out shortly. I told him I really wanted the babies noodles right away. 20 minutes later our appetizers came out but no kids meal! The waiter avoided eye contact and came back a few minutes later with the kids meal. This is where I should say I worked in the service industry for over 10 years. I understand busy, I understand the kitchen getting 'under water' but the kitchen at this location should have been closed down until they caught up. Shortly after our baby meal (which now our stubborn toddler was overtired and hungry but refused to eat) arrived our waiter brought us an extra appetizer while we wait for the entrees. It wasn't anything we wanted but it was Mother's Day and I didn't want to be nasty, so I didn't say anything. I actually felt a little bad for our waiter, he was not in the 'swamped' zone and he needed to be. Our meal didn't arrive to our table until 1 1/2 hours after ordering. I kept bringing the 20 month old outside to walk around. I think at some point my husband talked to the manager. When our food arrived he stopped by our table for ONE second and said oh good the food arrived. Everybody's happy now. Wait! What?? I am not happy. The 20 month old is NOT happy. And he's hungry! And that's it? So our waiter had another 'extra' dish for us. Some beef something which we again didn't want but Mother's Day not wanting to be nasty in front of my toddler and in laws so I just ate my food and let my husband deal with getting boxes and paying etc. I don't know if he left a tip or not - it wasn't entirely the waiters fault. I heard the waiter at the table next to ours apologize to those customers and tell them they would get dessert. He handled the situation better - tip for our waiter: avoidance is not good customer service. I have worked on nights similar to this one ( to my Garden friends think Black Thursday) and I am proud how our whole restaurant handled it. I'm embarrassed for this PF Chang's and hope you take an opportunity to debrief what went well (the high chair hunter) and what went wrong (from the hostesses to the kitchen and especially the management) and figure out how to make it better. Moral - DO NOT go to this location in any traditionally busy holiday! Lesson learned!",

For those not familiar with PF's-it's upscale (pricier than local) Chinese/Asian. Lettuce wraps are a great way to start, very flavorful. Entrees were chicken with black bean sauce; plenty of chicken, not much else besides the sauce. It was fine but not bursting with flavor. My wife had the orange peel shrimp (her favorite salt & pepper shrimp is no longer on the menu). It had a bit of a kick and was flavorful. You have a choice of white or brown rice. Mojito cocktails were excellent, done with real lime juice. Also had a couple of glasses of wine; a chenin blanc and albarino that were surprisingly good and reasonably priced. We had a friendly, attentive server who made sure we would never have to  wait for a drink.  Bottom line 3 1/2 stars.",

Definitely a crowd for family/friends outing. Bar is fun for friendly gathering for some sake bombs! Bartender very attentive and awesome!  Service - as mentioned, the bartender was attentive and I would def come back with my girls/guys for some fun drinks. The waiters/waitress was alright -- not bad, above average. They do tend to cater to my needs. On a busy night, it is harder for them. Also when it late towards closing, I don't see them being as attentive long.   Food - ummm... Ok. I am biased. But being very nice, it is average. They do serve a large portion, and there is a wide selection of entrees! So anyone can find something that they want, whether its seafood, poultry, meat, veggie -- etc!  Yes, as I am such a fan of authentic Chinese restaurant, I'd come back. I like the atmosphere, the location, and the bartendering service!",

    "text": "I know it's a chain, but I am definitely a fan of the Chang's.  Located at Phillips Place near SouthPark Mall, it serves as a central meeting place for lunch with the girls that come from the far corners of the Charlotte area and has consistently good service and food.    Meeting a girlfriend here for lunch today, we were both starving when we got there and couldn't wait to dig in.  My dining companion started off with the Salt & Pepper Calamari, which I did not have any of, but it appeared to be well prepared, and must have been good because she ate it all (it's not a huge portion).  Their lunch items are served with either a cup of soup or a salad.  I chose the egg drop soup - it is so good here.  Light, with a good broth, with whisps of eggs rather than big ole globs.  Served with fried crispy strip things (you know what I am talking about) that were light and fresh.  For my entree I ordered the Mongolian Beef, which I LOVE.  That is my all-time favorite dish and I almost always order it (I am boring, once I find what I like, I stick with it, lest I order something else and be pissed if I don't like it).  It is served with white or brown rice or for $1 more, fried rice.  The beef was tender, well cooked and all nice-sized quality pieces of beef.  For dessert (I told ya... I was starving... and I knew my dinner tonight was going to be a $.20 package of ramen noodles) I ordered the Banana Spring Rolls which are pretty much bananas wrapped in a spring roll wrapper, fried and then served with coconut-pineapple ice cream and drizzled with caramel and vanilla sauces.  Light-ish and quite good.  Different.  Service was very good, as it generally is whenever I go to PF Chang's.  For lunch, a drink and dessert, it was $22, which is more than I usually pay for lunch, but it was quite good and a nice afternoon with a good friend.",

Not only I was the food ready 45min later than the time frame they gave me over the phone, the food was soggy, underprepard and bland. For example, the Kung Pao Shrimp was not fried as it is supposed to be and doughy. My family always orders this dish in various locations and this was by far the worst.   Delay and food preparations aside, what really sets me off is that I not only waited 45 min to receive my food (altogether the preparation time was well over 60min), I have received nothing from the management as an apology but plenty of negative attitude.   Maybe I am spoiled but in every P.F. Changs I have been so far, I have received a credit on the bill or a voucher if something is off. This time I have received nothing (only a half hearted apology of the manager).   in my opinion, if a customer waits 45min in the restaurant for a $110 pickup order made on the phone, prepays AND still gives $5 tip, I expect to get something off the bill. Here, however, I have received nothing.  I will not visit this restaurant anymore and cannot recommend it. Sadly it has lost its game - maybe it was the Tusday manager.",

Oh and thanks to their inexpensive black cloth napkins my white jeans are now covered in lint.  The newly designed menu reads more like a Red Robin menu.  Thankfully with all these \"improvements\" they haven't changed the quality of the classic items on their menu - I still love the Chang's spicy chicken and tofu lettuce wraps.

The scallops were tender, but were very much coated & fried in an oriental sauce. It had no spice or bite at all. The pepper steak was edible, but not delicious or memorable by any means.  We appreciate the gift to be able to try it, but we were thankful we didn't come for a full dinner to spend extra.

Now I'll admit, my Asian friends and family back home tend to give pf changs a bad rap because its not authentic. And, well it's not authentic. It more asian fusion than it is Chinese, but that's ok. It takes some of the flavors and influences that are more universally appealing and appreciated and makes signature dishes out of those. And it is pretty well executed, in my opinion.   I've been to a number of Pf changs locations over the years and I like this location a lot. I actually dined here two weeks ago and my wife, friends and I really enjoyed ourselves. The waitstaff was excellent. Our food was fresh and delicious and the bar is decent too. I like my experience there and honestly have never had a bad pf changs experience ever.",

Once she showed we waited for over an hour after placing our order and asked her where was our food? She said it would be at least another 20 minutes because \"they don't have anyone working in the kitchen!\" I asked to please speak with a manager and after 30 more minutes, still no food and no manager. We got up an walked out after 2 hours with no food and only one round of drinks! We saw the mangager on the way out and he was very unapologetic. The worst experience ever with a friend from out of town! This location will be out of business soon and we are very sad about that because it was one of our favorite restaurants and one we frequently visit until today. Very sad!",

I actually did try their frozen dinners sold at Harris Teeter. They were... not so impressive. That's probably why I never went to their restaurant.  Now, we walked around the Phillip's Place to look for a place to eat on Saturday night and at the time, P F Chang's was jam packed. The wait would have been 45 minutes so we went to Dean & Deluca nearby. The next day, however, there were no lines around 3:30 pm. My wife and I B-lined to the place and had a great early dinner at 4 pm.  I ordered the crab wantons for starter, and the new Korean steak bulgogi for entree. My wife ordered the Spicy chicken. They were all really good. Now, I'm easy to please if you have anything that has 'bulgogi' or 'galbi' in its name. But I'll be honest as to why I like it or dislike it. And I do loathe some unworthy knockoffs that shouldn't bare the name. This time, the Steak Bulgogi was good enough to keep its name. Needless to say, we'll be back.",

I called in my order for pick up and it went smoothly...  Upon arriving, I was greeted and informed they have a new pick up station... I kind of like the idea of picking it up at the bar, but I get why they switched it up... Keeps the seats at the bar free, so it makes sense... I had a few minutes to wait, so I headed over to the bar, though... The bartender was quick and friendly, so that was great... He mixed me a Twisted Whiskey Sour that was positively yummy, so that was worth the trip alone...  Now, I don't know if I put this food on a pedestal in my memories or what, but it was so meh... Almost painfully meh... I don't know if it was the extra spice that I ordered or what, but instead of the light crispness I remembered on the chicken, I got this sort of soggy, spicy situation... Some of the pieces were great, the others were almost unworthy of being chewed... At least the rice was good, I guess...",

I order take out just as much as I dine in and it is usually never disappoints.  Not the case the last two times I've ordered take out.  I hate giving such a low score.  I just want to see PF Changs go back to how it used to be.  Delicious! I ordered crispy green beans and received a regular order of spicy green bean instead. We love the Crispy Green Beans, so that was disappointing.  The Changs Spicy chicken had a piece of shrimp in it.  Thankfully Im not allergic, but I don't eat seafood.  The chicken quality seems poor.  Extremely thin cuts where its mostly breading.  Our Kung Pao chicken was burnt and extremely dry, we didn't even take a second bite.  The Beef a la Sichuan was thick cuts of beef instead of the thin sliced.  The side of Sichuan asparagus had no flavor.  Lastly, I always order the Garlic Noodles that used to be on the menu and the last three times, I've had to add a sauce from my own refrigerator.  They basically were just cooked noodles with cilantro on top.    Next time I have a craving, ill think twice about ordering.  Makes me sad because I really do love that place.",

We ordered a mountain of food, from shrimp vegetable rice to Kung pao shrimp, both chicken and shrimp lo mein, and a couple more I can't think of at the top of my head. Not only was the food delicious but our waiter was extremely kind. He took his time explaining the menu and which items he reccomend. He even offered to take our group picture!

It was very low lighting where it could be a intimate setting but it was kind of bad for me to get a good picture for you guys. I ordered the honey crunchy chicken with brown rice he ordered the Mongolian steak with white rice. We also got the California roll with eel sauce. So to start the servings are family style definitely shareable. I didn't get to taste his food because I don't eat beef but he said it was really good they were just a little stingy with the sauce for his rice. The chicken for me was really good it also had like some crunchy noodle strings which assisted with the church of the chicken being the chicken is coated. I'm not a big rice fan but I will say my brown rice was a little dry. It was his birthday and I noted that when making reservation and they did not forget. They didn't make a big hoorah which made him happy. the waitress just walked over and brought him a banana spring rolls with berries and coconut ice cream with one candle which was enough for him as far as excitement level. The dessert was free of charge and it was really good the ice cream was our fave part of the dessert. we didn't realize there was outside seating but there is for you guys who love to eat out doors. the atmosphere outside of the restaurant is way to cute with shopping and benches to sit and cute pictures can be taken. the area is clean and nice. we would visit again it was to crowded and we were seated upon arrival to our reservation. they were great with customer service.",

    "text": "I find PF Chang's recent push for \"Farm to Wok\" and healthy, nutritional eating to be absolutely fascinating. I just don't feel like I'll ever be able to associate PF Chang's and health, although I'm happy that they're making the shift!  Complimentary valet is nice, but circle around the Phillips Place parking area once or twice and just make sure you can't get away with getting a space on your own. The space is honestly beautiful. Very well designed with several rooms with different \"themes\". We were seated in a room with a sliding barn door and Edison lights, which seemed like it could be closed for private events. We started with an order of egg rolls with their trio of dipping sauces, which were hot and delicious.  I ordered the Lobster and Shrimp Rice, and The Lady ordered the Street Noodles. The other couple we were out with ordered the honey chicken and the honey shrimp. Everything came out hot and fresh, and I loved my lobster. Thought it was well cooked and got a pretty big portion for the price. I also ordered the Twisted Whiskey Sour, which was delicious and a lot of drink for the price.  They recently changed up the ordering system in the kitchen, and they're still getting used to it. Because of that, the tickets were getting massively backed up. Our egg rolls took about 25-30 minutes to come out, and I did ask for them to be comped. Jessica, our waitress, was excellent in communication to us and fantastic in getting her manager. The manager did come out and comp us for our wait, and also provided us a free appetizer for next time. I didn't want that to detract from the star rating, because honestly, they did the best they could and provided us great customer service. It's the little things like that that will keep me coming back for seconds :)",

    "text": "I was in the area this past weekend and really thought I need to check out P.F. Chang's, as it has been 10+ years since I have been to one.   I arrived shortly after 12:00pm on Sunday and was seated in the front area of the restaurant and noticed how clean, open and inviting the restaurant was. I didn't remember liking it years ago, but maybe they have made some changes.   After being seated I was approached by my server, who was very sweet and took my drink order. After reviewing the menu, with several changes and 'new' items I decided to try a few appetizers/starters to see how things were.  I ordered the egg rolls, wonton soup and the infamous chicken lettuce wraps.  The wonton soup and egg rolls arrived first. The soup was a great. I ordered the cup ,which serves one, and was the perfect size, although next time I will order the bowl, which serves four, so I can take some home as left-overs.  Although I wish they would offer a medium bowl, somewhere in between 1 and 4 servings, ha ha! The egg rolls were piping hot and filled with a variety of vegetables, carrots, sprouts, etc. and pork. Perfectly cooked with a crisp shell and not too greasy, like some you find at other places.  Although I loved the egg rolls I found the dipping sauce was a little too mustardy for my liking. I actually used some soy sauce, perfection. The chicken lettuce wraps arrived shortly after and they were piping hot, still steaming.  The dish arrives with a pile of crisp lettuce leafs for wrapping. The dish is a perfect size, for one or for sharing with another appetizer/started and has great flavor. I was not surprised it is one of their signature items. The menu items I tried were great and the service was on point. Too my surprise I was glad I stopped in and will definitely be back to try one of their meals/entrees.",

Hostess was friendly but we were seated awkwardly close to other patrons on a half-booth/half-table area. There were not a lot of people there but it seemed we were all crushed into the same area. Our table was also pretty sticky. We ordered a sushi appetizer and the tuna was high quality, though the sushi did not stay together very well. For our meals we ordered the spicy chicken and the orange chicken. Both were tasty and had a good flavor. Our waitress was friendly and attentive but accidentally gave us the wrong check at the end. She quickly fixed her mistake. Overall pleasant experience, the manager also came over and checked on us during our meal, which was a nice touch.",

Yes, there was a wait but it was within the 20-25 minutes we were told when we arrived.  However, there always seemed to be 6 or 7 empty tables.  My favorite is the ribs, which are an appetizer.  My wife and I decided to order 4 different appetizers (ribs, lettuce wraps, rice, and dumplings) instead of meals.  We asked for all 4 to be delivered at same time, which our server said yes to.  Our drinks were delivered quickly, but incorrect.  Our food took 20-25 minutes, and came out piecemeal.  A person delivered the rice and lettuce wraps, but we had to ask about our other dishes.  Waitress told us they would come out soon, but it took another 15 minutes.  We were told that 2 employees had quit that night and that a manager had to leave the restaurant to get silverware, they had run out.  Strange.  While I understand people quitting, we also observed 2 employees at a work station  near us and they were not that busy.  Hope this is a one-off.",

Our waitiress introduced herself, and brought us our waters. The plan was to split 2 apps and 1 main course. We got the Seared Ahi Tuna and the Northern Style Ribs, The tuna was very good, I'm a sucker for tuna apps. The ribs were delicious as well, they fell right off of the bone. There was a bit of fatty tissue on them, though. We then split the Orange Peel Beef, which I thought was okay, but I probably wouldn't get it again. Just didn't like how it tastes, although I know plenty of people like it.  Service was below average, our waitress didn't smile or talk at all until the very end, when we gave her our Warrior Card number. Tip: sign up for Warrior Rewards and you'll get free lettuce wraps just for signing up, which are delicious. The floor of the restaurant was also a little dirty, which I didn't like.  Overall, a good experience at PF Chang's. I would definitely visit again.",

    "text": "If you're familiar with PF Chang's and their look, you probably wouldn't recognize this one in the SouthPark area.  To blend in any strict SouthPark codes, the restaurant looks like every other building in the area on the outside with just their name added.  Not until you get up to the front door (hidden in a breezeway) do you begin to recognize the establishment.    I've been to this PF Chang's a few different times and had varied experiences.  The first few times were good, as expected.  Then I had the most crazy experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  The hostess pulled a superiority card and said she couldn't seat our party of five for 45 minutes because there were no tables available to accommodate our size.  I pointed several out to her and she shrugged her shoulders.  That's right:  she shrugged her shoulders at me.  I guess nobody taught her how to count and spot empty tables before, so my logic blew her away.  I wrote a letter and got an immediate response from the GM who was very apologetic and invited us back.  We did give them another try and have been back a couple of times since.    Our return visits have been very good.  The food always tastes delicious and the service was excellent, too.  The chicken lettuce wraps are on the appetizer menu, but they make a fantastic meal for one.  I feel like I'm eating so healthy -- yet so tasty -- when I choose them.   If I'm really hungry, I go for the Ginger Chicken with Broccoli or Ground Chicken with Eggplant.  It's tough to decide between the two for me.  And usually it's white rice for me as an accompaniment (instead of their other option of brown rice).  I tried the Orange Peel Chicken once, not realizing how much orange peel they really put in the entree.  Ever eaten a lot of orange peel?  It's bitter.  And totally ruins the flavor of the meal.  And there isn't enough soy sauce in the world to correct it.  So what did I learn?  Orange Chicken good.  Orange PEEL Chicken bad.    One of my favorite touches at PF Chang's is that they offer a variety of sauces at the tables.  You can mix your own combination of oil, vinegar, hot mustard, soy sauce, and chili pepper sauce if you want to...or just go straight for the chili pepper sauce solo and let the heat take over.  YUM.    The last time we were there, we splurged and got dessert, too?  Why?  They were tiny and calling our names.  For about $2, you can order a mini dessert (about two spoonfuls in a shotglass) just \"for a taste.\"  That way, you get the flavor without all the calories!  I tried 3 different ones -- and, mind you, I LOVE chocolate -- but the carrot cake one (with cream cheese frosting) was my favorite.  p.s. I rated PF Chang's not good for kids because they don't have kids' menus.",

All in all it you can tell they use quality ingredients in the food but it really is high priced Chinese food in my opinion. Yes I would go back but not in any hurry to go!",

    "text": "So we came here on a random Tuesday night for dinner. I've been here once before and had take out one other time and always found it decent food but forgettable and therefore  have forgotten to review up until now. I was told the lettuce wraps were good here so we decided to stop in!  Chicken Lettuce Wraps 4/5 stars - these were yummy and I could have made a meal out of it alone!!  Spring Rolls 2/5 stars - ehh they were only okay not a lot of taste going on here except for the heaviness of the lemon grass. The sauce to go with it was just yucky. I do feel spoiled by another restaurant which I love who has amazing spring rolls so I can't help but compare.  Mongolian Beef 4/5 stars - I didn't order this but tried it and I really liked it!! I definitely liked it better than the beef that was on my dish!!  Thai beef and noodle salad  3/5 stars - I honestly am not sure how to review this one. The taste was pretty good and they allowed me to take out the cucumber and add bean sprouts and I took out the mango. However there were no noodles in my salad?? Maybe I misread something but last time I checked it was supposed to have noodles in it. I didn't feel like waiting around for them to make a new one and they were busy and it was already getting late as we'd waited awhile. The beef was good but kind of dry and not as good as the mongolian beef. Overall I liked it enough that I will order it again to at least taste it the way it's supposed to be.  So averaging out it gets a little over 3 stars. I'm not sure I really want to round up on this one but since the Spring Rolls really drag it down and they were such a small part of the meal I will round up.  Oh the staff was super nice and did a rather good job considering how busy it was for a Tuesday night... Seems no one wanted to stay home on that warm weather day :)",

This place is way too expensive to not care about its product, service or reputation.",

Isn't that what a chain restaurant is?  Food for the masses?  We had shrimp dumplings, Mongolian beef and shrimp, scallop & snowpeas.  Not my choices, but I was with two people, I just let them order and we shared, no biggie.  Sometimes you just have to go with the flow.  Service was great.  In fact, our server was so professional, I need to send PF Changs an email, he was perfect.  He was friendly, never intrusive and knew we were celebrating a birthday and brought us cake, he didn't have to do all that!!    I like to go to PFC about 3 times a year.  It is what it is!",

We seem to always choose a bunch of appetizers instead of entrees and just make a meal out of them. This go around saw us trying their staple, the lettuce wraps, along with the lemongrass chicken pan fried wan tons and the Dynamite Shrimp plus a couple others. The lemongrass chicken wan tons were bursting with flavor. The dynamite shrimp were top notch! Very similar to Bang Bang Shrimp at Bonefish but these shrimp are bigger! Plus they got served in a martini glass (nice touch). A big shout out to our waitress, Ramona, and the rest of the team! Super friendly and very attentive! If there was any complaints it would be the overall set up. The tables are pretty close together so there isn't much in the way of privacy. The food & service makes up for that.",

I felt a little under-dressed... maybe the SouthPark crowd has a different definition of \"casual\" dining... but oh well nobody really called me out, but I definitely noticed a different \"dress code\" everyone else was following.  I didn't get the memo.  Anyways, the most important part:  the food!.  I ordered a chinese beer and a cup of egg drop soup to start... Lemon Scallops as my main dish with brown rice.  YUM.  There wasn't anything left on my plate.  I probably could have eaten more, but the portion size was good.  The parking lot at Phillips Place can be a nightmare sometimes.  Some people don't follow directions too well and park in spaces that are not spaces!  Anyways, I give myself a lot of time to get there so I was able to find a space with no problem, it was just getting out since some ____ (insert colorful word there) parked behind me and I had a time trying to back out of my legal parking space.  Our server was nice even though we were a big group and we also had a 1 year old with us.  He was a good sport about it and kept our glasses refilled and made sure all our food was good.   Overall a good dinner.",

I enjoyed my lunch but overall it wasn't anything special. I had Chang's spicy chicken with fried rice (which cost an extra dollar) and added a side of wontons (2 dollars for 2) I enjoyed the wontons. For once you could actually taste the crab meat. The chicken had a little spice to it but was tasty. Service wasn't bad but our waitress was slow about taking our order and bringing the check.  The food came out in under 7 minutes. It's a nice area to to eat but I prefer other Chinese restaurants in town.  I had the ginger beer and I could not drink it it was so bad. I've had it before and it tastes great but not today. I feel like this place is over priced but I realize it's a chain and that's just their price point. I would like to go back and try some of their soups and possibly the Buddha's feast.",

The wait was not as bad as we thought but once we were seated the wait was ridiculous.  We waited a hour and a half+ before receiving our food.  Our waiter, who was extremely nice kept saying the manger will be out to see you soon. We waited, we waited and we waited.  Final a gentleman come out, introduce himself, and brought out some of our food; please keep in mind a hour and a half+ later and that was it.  Our waiter returned and asked did he speak with us.  I shared wit him, he said hello and brought out some of the food.  He tried to make an excuse for him, stating he was extremely busy but will see what he can do about the bill.  He cane back and took $19 off the bill. I am not sure if I am upset or offended.  Maybe a little of both.  We waited never losing our cool, patience, and kind.  I feel if I would showed more frustration we have have been respected more. Very disappointed.  We did not leave until late and unfortunately, our daughter missed her favorite ice spot.  A wonderful trip that ended horribly.  Thank you to our waiter. My recommendation is to try another location.",

After waiting about 1 hour I finally spoke with the manager. His excuse was they were very busy. No kidding. PF Chang's are always busy- bad excuse. Meals do arrive and they were good (not great).   Felt bad for our waiter, Jodie. She was attentive and did the best she could. Don't know what the problem is. But I can say we weren't the only table having issues. We others conversing with manager and a couple of dinners gave up and left.  Stay away from this location. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere. Plenty of restaurants in Southpark area that will provide good food with much better service.",

The only reason they did not receive 5 stars vs 4 si because the egg rolls were not fresh which surprised me.  They were already cooked and had been sitting.  They were just not crisp.  The veggie curry dish was amazing.   I was also impressed by the manager. He took the time to go to each table and ask about the food.  You rarely see this anymore and I say kudos to him for doing a great job.   The service was also amazing and my server and her co-workers were very attentive.    I will try them again next time i am in Charlotte.",

I ordered the shrimp in lobster sauce with extra shrimp and white rice. I picked it up one to two minutes after it was scheduled and ate it five minutes within that time frame. The sauce was flavorless and shrimp had no flavor. The peas provided a small amount of something, the chestnuts provided crunch and the egg a different consistency, but overall it was a meal full of blah! The rice container wasn't even full of rice, maybe 75% full and didn't taste that good either. Maybe eating in the restaurant instead of getting take out would be a different story because if the meal was packed really hot the sauce might have been watered down from the condensation formed inside the sealed container. Maybe I'm just trying to rationalize my meal who knows.    I am presuming my meal was a fluke otherwise why would people come back, right? Needless to say, I will only come back if it's me versus extreme hunger and there are no other options. If I do come back it's chicken for me, maybe their sushi is better than this meal that I had.",

The broccoli was cut into huge pieces and it wasn't completely cooked so it was hard - and I couldn't cut it into smaller pieces because it was so hard... lastly the lo mein, it wasn't special. I could order from the Chinese restaurant from down the street and get better lo mein. The server was alright, checked on us a couple of times. This was my second time coming to a PF Changs, and I can definitely tell you this won't be my first choice but if my friend or family wanted to meet here, I would come.",

I'm in no way a Chinese food fan & try to stay away from it as much as I can, but my girlfriend likes it so I can't always say no to it.  I've only had lunch here, but the prices to me are more appropriate for a dinner visit. They have quite a unique, upscale twist on Chinese food & you get some pretty big portions. I've had a spicy chicken dish & loved it & my girlfriend loved her meal as well. As for sauces, they hand mix some sort of tasty sauce right at your table. Everything I had at my meal was tasty & I'll go back again if my girlfriend wants to go.  If I were a Chinese food fan, I'd have given PF Changs 4 stars, but with my disdain for this type of food I can only give it a 3.",

We started with the lettuce wraps, they were great and we had some left over and asked to have them packaged to take with us, the server included more wraps with out us having to ask for them, AWESOME. We also ordered Wonton Soup but our entrees arrived so we opted to take the soup home, which served as a great snack that evening. I had the Norwegian Salmon, excellent dish, cooked perfectly and a great healthy meal.

Walked in for lunch, late afternoon (around 3 PM) on a Thursday and as expected the place was only ~20% full. However, had to wait 10 minutes to be seated!?!? Did not bother to ask why since the hunger had overtaken the irritation As mentioned in an earlier review, the menu is limited and does not offer the variety one would expect. The appetizer portion sizes are below average and may leave you asking for more especially if you are planning to share. The main course dishes we ordered did not have any sauce (it would have been nice to have been told this by the waitress) as it meant having semi dry food with steamed rice. In terms of taste, I would rate the appetizers 4 stars and the main course 3 stars - they got the right spices but could have toned down the sweetness in some of the items. Overall a good experience but not impressive per se.",

Aside from being uncooked it was dry and loose, not the usual sticky Asian rice. Such a shame being an Asian restaurant where rice is the main staple and shouldn't be messed up. I find the rice in any Chinese buffet way much better! And actually it seemed like the food we had at PF Chang's were clones of your neighborhood Chinese buffets. We had Mongolian beef because it seems like they said it's one of the best but what I had was a beef stewed in sweet soy sauce with tons of chives. We also had the Cantonese shrimp which was very bland and didn't taste a thing. I say, it is overrated add to that over priced for such a taste. Thanks for the experience anyway.",

Which I did. The service and waitress was nice and attentive, however the food is still lacking. This chain used to be a top notch dining experience for Chinese chain upscale restaurant. However, the cooks at this restaurant has gone steadily downhill in the last two years so I think they must have had a change in their kitchen. The egg drop soup was fine, nothing great. My daughter's sesame chicken was passable, a little tough, she did not eat half of it (which she loves). My salmon was dry and flavorless with the filler rice. The waitress did not go over the sauces and that used to be a big service flavor enhancement. The won tons were good. I do not think I will go there again without a gift certificate. Honestly, Panda Express tastes just as good at this point. A disappointing end to a previously well loved restaurant. Too bad, I hope they change cooks.",

There a giant horse in front of the restaurant. My brother made reservations luckily because that place was pack. I normally don't do Chinese cuisines  but I decided to give this food a try. For a appetizer at the request of my sister in law we had lettuce wrap and it was really. The atmosphere was really good and waiter was really helpful and courteous. I order the short ribs with pineapple rice which by the way came on time alone with everyone else food. It was so good and I also tasted the some of the food my family . Everyone had a taste for different things on menu. I got a sweet tea with my meal and yes it was sweet. I was full and had to get a take out box. My mom got dessert in a shot glass. The waiter brought out a tray with all the different variety of desserts and my mom decided to get the apple pie in a glass. She love it.",

We decided to take a crack at this establishment. We have both been to this place when we were kids. So it has been a while. We came here Saturday night on the 14th of October. It's always a busy center, so we knew ahead of time that there was going to be some sort of a wait. To our surprise, the wait time was only 15 minutes. Our server was friendly. The reason I couldn't give 5 stars is because of the time it took for us to get our food. We didn't order appetizers. We didn't order alcohol. Just simple water which took us 20 minutes to get. And the food took an hour to get to us. When the food arrived it was very tasty! Nice and warm and neatly displayed. The pictures we took are of the food already sorted somewhat... we didn't have the self control to take a picture first. This place, overall, did a great job.",

So we said \"it's fine, but cancel the sushi order.\" She totally went off on us, saying (and I quote) \"the sushi IS NOT an appetizer and I did MY job properly and now the sushi's on ME if you cancel the order --and on and on..... so my friend (who was speechless and commerating the death of her husband, several years ago today) said quietly, \"just go ahead and bring the sushi and more wine, please.\"  We were astonished that a server would speak to us this way. We had finished the entrees when the sushi was brought out by the manager (Matt) who apologized for the timing.  We didn't tell Matt how she had verbally berated us. We ordered more wine (which never came) and then Kiara totally disappeared. This location has been declining in the past few months but today was the worst ever.  Please bring Changs back.",

There was a delay in the kitchen which I was informed and the server and manager came to the table to apologize.  As usual, the chicken lettuce wraps were great.  I also loved the wonton soup.  Even though this is a chain, I'm not afraid to admit that this chain has some of the best wonton soup I've ever had.  The fried rice seemed to be not as flavorful as I remember and the pork in it was a bit dry and chewy.  I remember the pork in the rice to be in smaller bite sized strips but tonight they were huge 1 to 2 inch chunks just tossed to the side like an afterthought.  The Mongolian beef was flavorful but half the dish were green onions which were a bit overpowering the flavor of the dish.  The beef was chewy and thick, not like I remember.  I felt the need to chew and chew and chew ... which is why I rarely eat beef or steak when dining out.",

Their service and food are always impeccable and anybody who passes by can smell the mouth- watering aroma of spices and fresh food. On this particular visit, I came with my grandparents and we started off with the calamari appetizer. It was perfectly cooked with a slightly spicy sauce that made you want more. To drink I had the strawberry lemonade and it had a perfect balance between sweet and tart, I highly recommend the drink if you want something refreshing. For entrees, I had the chicken lo mein while my grandparents had Kung pao chicken and the crispy honey chicken. My chicken lo mein was very delicious and had a perfect amount of chicken. I also tried my grandparents's dishes and they were both amazing as well although the crispy honey chicken really stole the show! One downside to my meal was that I had fruit with my dish and underneath the fruit there was a hair, I understand why that could happen but it wasn't very pleasant. Overall, I'd recommend this P.F. Chang's location!",

My husband made reservations for my birthday there and you would think that our server would have made sure we had an enjoyable night. This was our first time at this location and service was not great. We were seated right away but we were in the back next to a very large party, that kept getting larger and larger as the night went one.  Our server started off very nice, we explained that we we're celebrating a birthday and she took our drinks orders and appetizer order. 25 min went by no drinks except water and no appetizers.   Appetizers finally came and our drinks. Our server took our entree order. The drinks were not good, ginger beer and limeade. The flavor was lackluster. The appetizer we're the best part of the meal. We ordered the spare ribs and spring rolls. Well this is where the service really goes down and the food. No one came by to get our dirty plates, refill our water, give us new plates for our entrees..  nothing. Time goes by and our entrees come they literally push the dirty plates off to the side for our food and my order was wrong.  I get the attention of any server and ask for a menu, I am quite sure what I ordered isn't supposed to have tofu in it, which I am allergic too. Our server stayed out of sight, when I did see her she was cleaning tables, getting to go boxes and stocking stuff not looking out for her tables, which I noticed other people not looking happy. We get her attention again tell her I have the wrong order and we need new plates! She apologizes and gets the right order and new plates. But she is really nonchalant about it.  All of this made our celebratory night not as nice. The entrees were subpar, lacking flavor and sauce. The fried rice was wack. And I guess they don't do anything special for birthdays.. oh well we won't be returning.",

The ingredients do not seem fresh, the food actually causes me to have stomach problems, and it's extremely greasy and not particularly vegetarian-friendly. The service is still good overall, though.

Wish I could tell you how LONG it took for the main course to arrive....but after waiting ANOTHER 45 MINUTES (not ONCE did our server stop by to check on us, explain the delay, NOTHING)...we asked for the check and, after paying for the Dynamite Shrimp, we walked out. No tip. Again, our server said ABSOLUTELY  NOTHING.   WE. HAVE. NEVER. WALKED. OUT. FROM. ANY. RESTAURANT. EVER.  If I could give this restaurant less than 1 star, I would.

    "text": "And the adventure begins to P.F.Changs.......  On this adventure, we carefully chose our 2:45pm time slot, Just after the church crowd, and just before the early birds who retire early for the evening.   The number of guest in the restaurant were few, although we did notice a few smaller groups in the right side of the dining area, the left side was quite empty.  The view from the entrance allows you to view the kitchen, and it was bustling with food, and servers appeared to be quite busy moving the food out of the kitchen window.  We did witness a first hand accident which occurred at the kitchen doorway, which resulted in a loss of a few meals and dishes......I guess someone else in the restaurant was also on an adventure. I would refer to this as a detour or unscheduled event.  After approximately five minutes we were seated in the far left of the restaurant, just a few tables over from a party of thirteen.  This is where the adventure begins.......I will have a few rules of visiting restaurants at the end of this review.....  We were approached by our server, whom I will name \"K\", she was very helpful at first, but that is where it ended.  On this occasion we had the Kung Pao Chicken and the Chicken Lo Mein, our drinks were sweet tea, and water.  Let me re-phrase that, our drinks were suppose to be sweet tea and water. Water, check, Sweet tea - negative Ghostrider.  This tea was un-sweet and there were no sweeteners in sight.  After a few minutes \"K\" returned, we requested a few sweeteners, and this sufficed.  Our meal came out in a timely fashion, approx 15-20 minutes.  The portion sizes were nice, just enough for possibly two people to share, or if you are like me, the size was just right for a good hearty meal.  I enjoyed the Kung Pao, it was fresh, hot in temperature, just a few scallions, just enough red hot chili peppers, and the chicken had a nice crisp yet gentle taste.  I would consider this a very good meal and for the food,  I give it 4 stars.  My wife's meal was also very good, the noodles were cooked very nicely, and if there were any complaints it was that the chicken was lacking in the lo mein.....again, the food for her meal 4 stars.  Now the reason for the 2 star review.  The service.  Have you ever met someone and felt, \"Gee I really want to like this person, I want them to do very well, I want them to succeed, I want them to just do what it is that they do best\", but in this case, I was neglected, my wife was neglected and to make matters worse, the table of thirteen near us, was receiving all of her attention.  I drink water at my meals, I drink ALOT of water, at this meal, I had ONE glass of water, no refills, no follow ups, and this water was empty well into the meal.  I had to leave the last of my meal, because I did not have any water to wash down the white rice, which as one knows can be bland, if there is no water to help wash it down.  So here are the rules that should always be followed. ( I broke a few) 1. If the restaurant is empty and you have to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated, leave.....leave quickly. (this is NOT a good sign) 2. If you witness an accident involving 2 or more employees which result in dropped meals and drinks, resulting in broken dishes. Leave, leave quickly, that could be your meal next on the floor.  (this is not a good sign) 3. If you are seated right next to a big party and your server is attending to them, you are delightfully screwed in your needs and this is truly not a good sign. ASK for a different server and section.... 4. If you can't motion your server over due to the fact that they are so focused on others, and you are unable to view them due to your poor seating arrangement. ( I may want to consider wearing a clown shirt) 5. If your server apologizes to you AFTER the meal, then it may be just a little to late to receive a good tip. This is what I refer to as your OMG moment that you were dreading..... it's called ....the bad dining experience.  So to break this down:  The Pros:  1 Good Food, (reasonably priced) 2 Nice atmosphere,  3. Beautiful statues of horses,  4. Swinging door entrance, and  5. Good location.  The Cons:  1. Waiting for an empty table in an relatively empty restaurant.  2. Mirrors reflected smudge marks on every mirror located in our dining area.  3. Service,  4. Service,  5. And Service  So,  to sum up the dining experience it would have been a very strong 4 stars, but the service brought that down to a very strong 2 Stars. I will be back, but I will be assured that I will be in a different section, and insist on a different server.   NCFoodGuy",

    "text": "So when I moved to Charlotte I would always ask people where the best Chinese restaurant was.  And if you can believe it, I was told PF Chang's by countless people, most of whom did not know it was a chain.  It's like moving somewhere and asking for the best hamburger in town and everyone tells you it's Mickey D's!  Exactly.  So I did actually go since I had never been and the food was barely Asian as it was.  The only thing I liked were the lettuce wraps, I ordered the Mongolian beef and it was ok, but certainly nothing to write home about..    To conclude, this is a place for those who may want to dip their toe into Asian cuisine, but if you go here expecting great or even authentic Chinese food you will be sorely disappointed",

Normally I try to stay away from chains like this and go to local places, but Charlotte isn't known for its stellar ethnic food and I knew I'd like the food at PF Chang's.  The Mongolian beef seems to be popular among other reviewers and I have to agree. It's pretty delicious. My boyfriend had the shrimp fried rice, which was also good. Our server was really pleasant and helpful. All in all, it was a good dining experience. And I had enough left over to eat Mongolian beef for lunch today.",

    "text": "This place could have gotten a better score but for the service. Our server was fine yet they have a lot of bad habits. The trey stands they park in front of your table while they clean another, so you sit eating and looking at other peoples dirty dishes so close to you that you are more than a little annoyed.  Got the ahi tartar to start. This came out on wontons that were two bite size. Tried picking up and eating and they fell apart, tried to cut and they fell apart. They sent 5 to a table of two. Who gets the fifth one? Not well designed. Tuna was cut to big. I would suggest a smaller taco shaped wonton. Just sayin.  The two entrees were ok with the one bowl of rice that I could have fit in a half cup measure. The building I heard was just renovated but they had sheet rock dust every where and it seemed a little unfinished. For the 90 dollars we spent I could have gotten better at tintin for50. Won't be back.  The Bloody Mary was good.",

Our daughter spilled an entire cup of Egg Drop Soup on the table. Our server witnessed the incident and never brought over a rag to clean it up. We sat there for about 10 minutes with soup spilled all over the table. When our food came out, the man proceeded to place the food around the spill and then told us that he would bring a rag out. A few minutes later we still didn't have a rag and our food was getting cold. I eventually used diaper wipes I had in my purse to clean up the spill. Our server returned to the table at least three times and never mentioned the spill or the lack of help cleaning it up. The rag never did show up. We will not be returning to this location anytime soon.",

She was a little slow but no biggie. Maybe she had just came off lunch break. We told her about the rice being bland. She had one of the best chefs make us another order to take with us. That was nice. It was good too. We will return...it just depends on the day of the week. It won't be on a Tuesday!",

Both times we went for lunch and took an hour and a half. They served soup which took almost 40 minutes to get egg drop and it look like low tide in Louisiana. Big chunks of gray and black eggs floating in my egg drop soup, waitress looking at me like I was crazy. The manager came over to serve our food and asked how is everything I mention I was going to write a bad Yelp review and he said well thank you and walked away. This place used to have a long wait and now there's nobody ever there, now I understand why. Portions are small, service is bad and probably better off going to McDonald's.",

The salad was nasty, iceberg with some dressing that tasted like onions. The wait was forever long, and the server was rude and irritated because we didn't like the terrible food. On top of that, I used a $25 gift card and the manager tried to tell me it was some kind of \"dine with us\" card so after the almost $22 bill there was nothing left on it.

Second, the famous lettuce wraps were not the best I have ever eaten. Third, my meal of Lemon Prawns was bland and unimaginative. The best part of the meal was the delicious organic coffee I ordered.

Who thought I would ever enjoy working more than eating??--I think this meal was a first!  I got steamed veggies and brown rice.  Now I expected it to be pretty bland, since it mentioned no sauces added at all.  But the vegetables were rubbery, not crisp like they should be after a good steaming. The rice was pretty underdone as well, so all-in-all, they got nothing right.  I tried adding some sauces to liven it up a bit, but it was too little, too late.  Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the egg drop soup.  I usually add pepper to mine because I like the extra kick, but this needed much more help than a little pepper.  It was very bland, and didn't taste like anything.  Tasteless egg in water is definitely NOT something you want to keep eating.  And, of course, there was no salt and pepper on the table, so I couldn't even enjoy it the way I like.   Because I didn't pay, I didn't complain to the waiter, but normally this would not have passed by me.  Though the lunch prices are pretty reasonable, I still would not return here if given the choice.",

I'm willing to pay the big bucks for good mongolian beef since I can't find any edible mongolian beef anywhere else. I also dig their spring rolls, not too greasy and not too big.   Everyone seems to love the lettuce wraps, I'm not a fan of water chestnuts and they are in there, so I can't get over the texture, but otherwise the lettuce wraps are delish.   The crispy honey chicken is also good, that is what my husband orders and we split that and the mongolian beef.   If you don't want to fight the crowds, call in take-out, it's just as good at home in your comfy clothes as it is in the semi up-tight south park location. Seriously people.. it's a chain restuarant, it's not an exclusive 5 star place. No need to turn up your noses.  You get lots of food, good service and a semi-hefty check at the end, but really it's worth every penny.  Call ahead for reservations on the weekends! It's super busy!",

They do not have a very wide selection on the menu, but what they do have is good.  Its not authentic Chinese, but it is great for a mid-priced well decorated Chinese chain. I recommend the lettuce wraps, they're the shit, and the Honey Shrimp is pretty damn tasty too.  The honey shrimp reminds me a lot of Chicken McNuggets ( maybe its the way their fried, maybe its their colorartion and shape, or maybe I'm secretly yearning for those mini-paddys of chicken scraps fried in peanut oil and dipped in sweet n sour sauce...either way i digress) and the Honey flavor, so crisp... so sweet...what a treat.  Even if your girlfriend orders them before you, still get them their the best things on the menu.  I got the Moo-Goo Gai Pan, ( becuase I was the last to order and everyone else had already ordered the good shit, and I didn't want to look like a poser, so I orderd, well you know)  and it was a little bland, but they have a delicious \"special\" sauce that our waitress said she made herself, and it helped the flavor out alot. If you are in the South Park area check out PF Chang's, or if you have a  first date this would be a great place, because the decor and lighting create a feeling of wealth and exclusivity, but the prices are very manageable, and the food is better than average.",

    "text": "Seriously, the worse dining experience I've ever had from PFChangs. Most of the time, I'm a fan of the chain restaurant, but tonight was a poor reflection of what their brand stands for.   First, we made reservations for 8:45.  We arrived 10 minutes early and was told we would be seated closer to our reservation time.  Obviously, our reservation wasn't considered because we had to wait another 30 minutes to be seated.  Finally, we were sat...  \"Excuse me, this plate is dirty\", as I call out the next issue.  Then, we ordered drinks and placed our order for appetizers.  The waiter seemed cool.  We ordered a table full of appetizers to try a little of everything. Minutes later, the waiter is standing at the register behind us and another waiter walks to to say, \"we don't have any more spring rolls.\"  I'm like, ok... let's get some California rolls.  \"I'm sorry, we are out of sushi tonight as well.\"  I'm thinking - you are kidding me. We ordered our entrees.   15 minutes later, the first two appetizers arrived. Another 20 minutes later and I'm thinking that they must've run out of lettuce wraps too.  But finally, they arrived around 10 minutes later. However, although we had no food (for an extremely long period in between) the waiter kept our drinks full.    Finally, after another 20 minutes of waiting, we finally tell our waiter to cancel the entree orders and bring us the check.  He apologized, we paid, and we decided to leave our long term relationship as it was... damaged and unfulfilled.   That's my experience...unfortunately.  Not sure I'll be returning back to this location, especially on a Saturday evening.",

They previously had a decent meal deal for 2 people but they have removed that deal from their menu. The only reason this review recurved two stars instead of one is due to the decent service and the restaurant itself looked nice.   The food was absolutely terrible. The lettuce wraps had no flavor, the lettuce did not seem fresh, and there was only a few tiny bits of chicken. The shrimp salad was 99.9999% sad looking iceberg lettuce with a few random toppings. There were around 7.5 tiny shrimp that looked, smelled, and tasted terrible. The shrimp pad Thai was a little better than the salad but still way below expectations. Tiny shrimp, very little flavor, and a lot to be desired.  Needless to say none of us finished our meal and we did not get boxes to go. I may need to break my parents heart and ask them to stop buying me gift cards to P.F. Chang's.",

Each time, there has been something wrong with my order, but I've never called, I've just dealt with it. This time, I ordered almost $50 worth of food for me and my coworkers and of course they forgot the extra sauce I asked for with my crispy green beans. How hard is it to forget the ONE thing it already should come with?! Some may think this is petty, but there is literally something wrong with my order EVERY TIME I use their delivery option, so quite frankly I'm annoyed at this point. I placed my order through THEIR website--they apparently used DoorDash to deliver. The employee told me I would have to go through DoorDash to get any sort of refund. So, even though I ordered through the PF Chang's website and THEY are the ones who screwed up the order, I have to go through an impossible to reach third-party delivery service?! Just fix the problem! As much as I order from them, I will not be doing so again. You lost a frequent flyer!",

A separate time we had an open table reservation and they canceled it because they ere too busy. How is that possible. We had a reservation. Makes no sense and no one apologized.

Everyone THOROUGHLY enjoyed everything!  I had to feed 30 people, and \"The Whole Kitchen\" catering package made the process nice and tidy!  There were beef, chicken, and veggie options, a salad, rice, spring rolls, lettuce wraps, etc... it arrived on time, hot, fresh, and delicious!!

And noodles. I asked that they remove the prawns and just make the noodles. The noodles tasted like they had prepared the prawns and placed them on then took them off. And what do you know...I had an allergic reaction and I'm almost positive it was from that.  With the small portions of food at such a big price, I was very disappointed. It was almost like they prepared one entree and then split it amongst my husband and I. That's how small the servings were... This was the worst experience I've ever had at a PF Chang's.",

But to their credit, they do make a good and fancy meal.  The item I remember best of all is the chicken lettuce wraps. And they're just as good as I remember from years back. They seem to like dabbling in all Asian foods to some degree and the alcohol menu has no lack of Japanese beers and spirits. They'll make you an old fashioned with Suntory whiskey that I really liked or they'll serve you the Hitachino Nest Red Rice Ale.  The menu is extensive but still holds quite the Chinese lean. They bring big plates of shareable food, to-go containers look like those folder paper boxes and fortune cookies are a given. The fortunes even carry a bit of P.F. Chang's history on the back instead of learn Chinese. Prices are a bit steep but service is also worth it. They seriously get hit hard here on Saturday nights so make sure you get reservations or just stay away.",

In the US you can find it in San Francisco, New York, and Boston...  but that's it.     The rest of the country will never know GREAT chinese food, but they may be lucky enough to find good chinese food.   The vast majority of Americans will only ever get OKAY chinese food.  P.F. Chang's is better than OKAY and  just shy of being GOOD chinese food, which is why so many people who don't know what good chinese food is get so excited about this place.  P.F. Chang's is basically just a a couple steps up from the Panda Express at your local food court... except it's a lot more expensive.    The ONLY thing that stops me from giving P.F. Chang's a lower rating is that they actually make a really fantastic hot and sour soup- which is an incredibly hard thing to find.  The hot and sour soup is always salty- sometimes too salty... but when they do it just right, it's very delicious.     *In case you're wondering, there is good chinese food in charlotte... or at least something very close to it.   Look for a little place called Wan-Fu at 10719 Kettering Drive.",

    "text": "On a coworker's suggestion, three of us visited for lunch. For 12:30 on a weekday, the place was barely a third filled. The three hostesses were clearly underworked trying to organize the few customers into tables.  PF Chang's has a special lunch menu if you want to save a few bucks. I had the Almond and Cashew Chicken with brown rice. The $10 meal comes with a bowl of egg drop or hot & sour soup. There was plenty of chicken (not fried! yay!) and a large serving of rice - enough to take half of the meal home in a nice container. The sauce was very flavorful, though it seemed to be a little light on both the almonds and the cashews.  One friend ordered the Combination Lo-Mein from the main menu and was very satisfied. He said that there was plenty of beef, chicken and shrimp in there.  The waiter was attentive without being overbearing. He mentioned that each of the staff has their own recipe for the condiments, preparing his own recipe in front of us. If you ask me, it seemed a little silly, but it's part of the charm that is PF Chang's. After the meal, he brought over the dessert tray. The cheesecake and mini-cheesecakes looked good, as did the six-layer chocolate cake that must have been the size of a small football. We declined.  Good service, good food, a decent price for a lunch meal.",

I crave the orange peel shrimp occasionally and have to go get my fix!  Their lettuce wraps are the best around.  I've tried them from other restaurants and they don't hold a candle to PF Chang's.    It is very moderately priced and affordable but the ambiance of the establishment gives you the feel of a more upscale and expensive dining experience.  If you haven't been yet you have to try it!",

    "text": "I visited the PF Chang's in the South Park area recently, and it was just okay for me. Not horrible, and definitely not spectacular, but just okay.   We sat at the bar and the best part of our experience here was the bubbly bartender and the lone businessman sitting next to us. We had good conversation with them. But hey, you are reading this for a food review. So here goes:  Hot N Sour soup = pretty good. I must now admit that I have some insight into the land of PF Chang's, considering I used to be an employee at a NY location. Let's all be serious here; it's a chain, the mcdonald's of chinese food. The kitchen just pumps the meals out, and you will notice that you can have anything on the menu sitting in front of you within 5 or 6 minutes, minus the chilean seabass. They are so busy, and spit the food out so fast, it just isn't the kind of place that you are going to get a quality meal.   I do recommend the mongolian beef - the mongolian sauce is excellent. Just be prepared for your hands and feet to swell given the sodium levels in this thing - out of control. I also always get the ma po tofu - this was the dish that got me into tofu in the first place, considering I never used to be able to say the word 'tofu' without gagging. It's very tasty, a bit crispy, and in a spicy/garlicky sauce with steamed broccoli. A third and final recommendation is the lemon pepper shrimp - again, the sauce is what makes this dish. If you have room for dessert, do yourself a favor and order the banana spring rolls - it's a night ender, but so worth it!  I didn't find any yucky bugs in my meal, but I will say this: I've worked in plenty of restaurants, fancy and not, and I've seen them everywhere - it is inevitable that roaches will infiltrate. It's pretty unavoidable. That is disturbing though that it made it all the way onto your plate - a quality restaurant, a CLEAN restaurant, will take care of the problem right away before it gets that out of hand, and obviously PF Chang's is just not on that scale.",

However your food seems to be lacking something for me, and the prices aren't that cool either.  When we walked in we were seated promptly in a nice section. It's such a nice restaurant, but for the quality of food you get for the price it's woefully lacking. I guess what you're really paying for is location and service because both are top notch. We ordered a bunch of menu items and I seriously can't remember my meal there. Stuff tends to be either too salty or too bland, and tastes pretty much the same.  I really wanted to like this place, but I don't think I'll be back. When I'm in the mood for some americanized Chinese I think I'll just stick to the takeout place for tastier food at half the price.",

The decor is interesting, the servers I've had have all been attentive and gave great service, and the food is always good.   My real problem is that while the food is good, it tastes the same as my neighborhood take-out place. It's hard to rationalize spending $16 on sesame chicken that tastes the same as the $9 sesame chicken combo at the place around the corner. If the price is double, I'm expecting some miraculous-tasting chicken.  If I'm invited out with a group, I'll go again, but until that happens I'm sticking with Bei Jing Chinese.",

    "text": "Consistently disappointing...  I struggled with whether to provide 1 or 2 stars and finally landed on one due to several factors: experience, price, and overall poor food quality.    Having visited PFs several times in the past I had vowed not to return but was persuaded by my wife and the nagging popularity of the place that has me asking myself: 'Maybe I am missing something here'...  We did takeout and were told when we called that it would require an hour to prepare the food (we had called at 6PM and were expecting a little time, however that seemed excessive).  Upon arrival they had screwed up the order and to their credit did try to make things right by providing the food error to us for free while working 'on a rush' to correct the mistake.  All fine and good, but caused a delay of 25 minutes for our food with a screaming 2 week old in the car.    We had Lo Mein that was excessively greasy while the vegetables lacked any crisp.  The dish had little flavor behind the grease, but with enough Sararchi sauce I could numb my mouth beyond taste. It felt like a dish that had been reheated in the microwave.  The portion was large, but whats a good sized portion if the food is low quality.    My wife had crispy honey shrimp that was slightly better, but the portion in this case was on the skimpy side.  Their heralded lettuce wraps were just OK as well, with more water chestnuts than chicken and again lacking much flavor.   With the overall poor experience we will steer of PFs in the future and look for smaller, more locally owned operations for our Aisan fix.",

I also like the Hot Fish and the Singapore Street Noodles! Also, the brown rice is excellent, very nutty and cooked perfect every time.   The Great Wall of Chocolate is superb, especially because of the fresh berries! For a gluten free dessert you must try the chocoloate dome (also with berries)!",

    "text": "There was a time when I would eat here on a weekly basis.  While there is very little you could term \"authentic cuisine\" here, I've got to vote with my taste buds and just admit I'm still a sucker for this place.  (Boos and hisses from the crowd.)  I'm even a given for their often too-hyped appetizer- the chicken lettuce wraps (bonus for the vegetarian version too- equally good I've found).  Nobody does it this good- all the components are finely chopped and the cups of lettuce are perfectly shaped.  I even like the sauce they create for you table-side.  Start with ponzu sauce as a base, then add spicy mustard and chili sauce for some spice.  My one gripe on this app is that they never bring out enough lettuce cups.  Every table always needs a few more here.  Why not just bring them out to start with?  The main dishes are broken down by the type of meat you desire and these is (again) a nicer section for the vegetarians.  Almost everything you see is a take on a well-known American chinese dish- beef and broccoli, moo goo gai pan chicken, etc.  I just find that most, if not all, of these dishes are exceptionally well executed.  Score one for consistency.  I also find portions are big enough to share, and they generally have the price tag to match.  Luckily you also get a choice of brown or white rice, and they'll bring as much s you need.  My personal favorite is their kung pao chicken.  Sauteed with hot chili peppers and peanuts, the chicken is crispy without being breaded and has  nice touch of spice.  I also put the spicy sauce from the lettuce wraps on my rice- make it as spicy as you dare!  Couple of notes of interest here- their iced tea is all now flavored- tropical breeze or some other fruity mix.  Not too bad but not too good either.  For something different, try one of their many hot teas- the dragon oolong is especially nice.    They have also begun pushing these mini-dessert cups that cover most of the well-known desserts categories- red velvet cake, carrot cake, smores, etc.  These are about 3-4 bites big and they all come from the freezer.  I'm not a fan.  These still have a massive cake slice called the great wall of chocolate and, believe me, you will need a small army to surmount it.  Watch out for crowds on the weekends.  Friday and Saturday night used to have a wait that could top an hour.  Most any other time, you should be able to walk right in without any wait whatsoever.    As a big corporate chain, I should hate this place, but I just can't deny how good this place tastes.  And the primary rule is just this- let the flavor rule.  PF's has the flavor.",

It's especially good for people who are reluctant to try different types of food outside of the usual american food (it's a good place to take that first step).  For some reason PF Chang's has a hard time getting repeat business out of me unless I'm meeting up with friends and they picked the restaurant.    I went to this location on a Wednesday evening to meet a group for a birthday party around 8pm and this place was overflowing with people.  I have never felt so grateful to have a reservation.  We had one waitress for a group of around 11 people and she did a surprisingly good job of keeping all of our orders straight and staying on top of drink refills.  At the time I was trying to watch my calorie intake closely and there weren't too many low-cal entree options.  I ended up ordering the chicken lettuce wraps with extra spice.  They were decent but probably not something I would ever crave.  The hubby ordered some kind of spicy chicken-coated-in-sauce entree that didn't seem to have too much flavor.  Overall, ok food at slightly above average cost.",

My waitress tonight said there was nothing hot or spicy on the taco. Then she came back to tell me they were out of shrimp and lobster so I couldn't have my tacos. My wife had ordered street noodles with shrimp so she asked about her dish the waitress stuttered a little then said she was sure they were out of lobster but they did have shrimp. I asked her for the tacos without the lobster and she was good with that. A few minutes later she came back to the table and said they now have lobster for my tacos. She brought three tacos and went back to order my fourth. The first bite I took my mouth lit up. The peppers were hot why didn't she know this when she said that was one of her favorites. Not a good night. One more little thing the 3 tacos on the menu were 10.95 add a fourth and their 14.00 just so you know.",

He went into further detail saying that new management has to shadow every job in the restaurant so they get a feel of all parts of the restaurant so they could provide the best service possible. Two thumbs up for that. We enjoyed cocktails such as the PFX (which of course I kept calling the P90X) X-RATED Fusion Liqueur, Mango Vodka and Pama Liqueur shaken with a splash of Sprite and the Lucky Cat Martini (Vanilla Vodka, Chambord, Pineapple Juice)which I will go back there again just for that.  We started off with the famous lettuce wraps. I say famous because anytime I hear someone talking about PF Changs, they always rave about how wonderful they are. They didn't disappoint. When our entrees came out, I didn't realize that it was a family style kind of thing going on but I like that. I always have food envy so I was happy that I got to try other things besides the Orange Peel Chicken that I  ordered. Everything was fabulous......except my fortune in my fortune cookie.",

    "text": "Will update once Manager calls back but until then be careful of Great Wall of Chocolate and its raspberry sauce. We were there 2 nights ago and ordered dessert right before closing. We took home cake. Waiter suggested a new container of raspberry sauce instead of scraping the decorative amount on plate. So he brought it out and stuffed it into the same dish as chocolate cake. Okay so not a fan of non-food items being packed in and touching food items in transportation but...we went with it. Everything got refrigerated as is. Yesterday I pull out cake with small raspberry sauce container. Commenced eating cake after pouring sauce over cake. Raspberry sauce is sitting out on my counter as I continue eating cake. It is 68 degrees in here because we prefer it cool with so much sun outdoors. Next thing we hear is a loud POP. My dog looks just as puzzled because no one is in the kitchen yet that is where the noise came from. Immediately go to find the source of the POP and see the once covered raspberry sauce now has its lid on the floor AND there are specks of sauce all over the counter. The sauce has no doubled in size and is frothing. So now I see a frothy, foamy, lighter wine-colored version of the sauce I just used. Smh... We were busy yesterday so we went about the day not eating anything else. But I kept noticing a nauseous feeling. Gave the sauce to my husband to test (access to labs). My husband calls to say tech says sauce contaminated! So disgusted!! I went to sleep and woke up with same form of nausea. Called PF Changs where the first \"manager\" sent me to another manager. He seemed concerned but wants to call me back after speaking to company. However he was quick to add that the company has \"...no idea what happens to the food once it leaves PF Changs.\" Smh He was quick to add a little \"...no slight to you\" and \"...never heard of this in my 10 years.\" I love Chocolate and that cake was $10 (tax). The last thing I expect from any restaurant was contamination and a quick company-man-response. Folks get any of their sauces and leave on counter for a few minutes and if it froths or doubles in size...capture that mess and call health department.",

    "text": "So I have to admit that I haven't been to a PF CHANGS in several years. When I traveled for business I always looked for PF's  and eventually ate at twenty different locations and everything was consistent at each location. I miss some of the old things...Sauce prepared table side and most of all...DUCK! Normally when we went we always ordered five or six appetizers and finished everything. There wasn't a location where we used to live and moving back to the Charlotte area we finally decided to go. As an original WARRIOR CARD HOLDER, and not dining at any PF's in years, I was constantly getting emails with special offers. We decided to take them up on their \"buy one entree get one\". What a disappointment this meal was. I had KUNG PAO SHRIMP. A small plate came to the table with almost enough shrimp to make a meal out of and very few peanuts. It looked like the kitchen thought of putting some sauce on the plate but after a few drippings, thought better of it. The celery also seemed to be non-existent. My wife had CHANG'S LOBSTER AND SHRIMP RICE.  Once again another plate of just okay food.  The fried lobster was over cooked and chewy. The rice was also over cooked and had no taste. We had to ask for the dipping sauce from the Calamari to add some flavor.  I usually send bad food back but we had our Granddaughter with us and didn't have the time. We just suffered through the meal.   Sorry PF CHANGS but it looks like a few more years of emails before we go back. On the positive side, our waiter was excellent.",

The chicken had a bitter/sour taste and my beef was so dry it was like eating beef jerky.  The freakin rice was so dry it was like hard to pick up with the fork.  The only tasty dish was our appetizer lettuce wrap.  Our server was pretty cool, nice guy, attentive and speedy.  Even the stupid fortune cookies were stale.  $50 later I regret trying the Philips place version of PF Changs.  The National Brand would be highly embarrassed with their name associated with this wretched food.  Caution to anyone having that craving for good upscale Chinese food.  Go grab a burger or something.",

I was very surprised to learn the chef does not use MSG in the dishes but it didn't compensate for the lackluster flavor.

Even though they will be pricier than your normal Chinese options there are some reasons why... #1 Farm to Wok section of the menu. They use Fresh ingredients and American beef. #2 many gluten free options that have dedicated preparation areas so there is no cross contamination #3 great appetizers. Many people will recommend the lettuce wraps to you but do yourself a favor and get the wings instead and ask them to come out extra extra crispy. They are the best things of my life right now cooked in Thai sweet chili sauce #4 desserts: they have lots of fantastic desserts #5 sushi is even on their menu. So there's some great variety there.  #6 you can make reservations. The only issue I had was that our waitress did not frequent our table often and she had given someone the wrong order.

If I were suffering from a salt-deficiency, then you would be perfect, but as I am in relatively good health and prefer to stay that way... I will have to find my Kung Pao fix elsewhere.  As for the rest of the experience, was most of the food good? Sure! Our other meals were tasty, you could tell care was taken in making the dishes.  Was the service good? Yes, our server was great! Very friendly and attentive and friendly to our children as well.  On the other hand, the hostess seemed completely disinterested and apathetic. Shouldn't that be the welcoming face and voice you are greeted with when entering a restaurant? Why is a poor experience at the doorway allowed to happen? She was not unkind, but just completely without emotion... which left us feeling unwelcome.  While not excusable, PF Changs is not alone. In fact, it's too pervasive in many restaurants today. Why many restaurants choose to look the other way for this type of behavior is beyond me. It's one of the basic job criteria. You either meet it or you don't.",

Instead I went to PF Changs in the South Park area, where I would've expected let's just say a different experience. Our server was weeded, which I understood from being a server for a decade in my past life. When our food finally arrived I needed a simple side of potsticker sauce. I asked five different associates to no avail, I honestly felt like I was asking them for their first born child or possibly an algebraic equation. Even asked the host which was a little twit, he was smirking and being condescending like seating people is something to be arrogant about. I inevitably gave up on my sauce told the server to put our entrees in a to go box and asked for the check. I told my server I was not interested in speaking to a manager sometimes there's no resolve as I had already explained myself multiple times and was beyond frustrated. But nonetheless here comes Todd. Covered in sweat, rolling his eyes, borderline belittling me as I again told him the deal. Now I can certainly empathize with it being Mother's day, a day that tends to be more crowded in nature but I wasn't off-put by the slow service but the lack of situational awareness. How could 6 people still not have a ramekin of sauce on our table? Todd's attitude was unwelcoming, rude and beyond off putting. I honestly laughed at him and asked him to leave our table. His lack of professionalism & self awareness was shocking. Basically the place is a joke, used to be a well oiled machine. I don't know why am surprised when the sole point of failure or success rides in the hands of Todd.",

When we arrived, the parking lot was expectedly full so we took advantage of the free valet parking.  The restaurant was very, very busy...there people waiting outside as well.  We arrived just after 6:30 and they had us seated within 5 minutes.    We started with drinks...Blue Moon for my husband, Asian Pear Mojito for me (Delicious!!!!), Bacardi & Coke and Red Wine for our friends.    For appertizers, we ordered Pork Dumplings and Chicken Lettuce Wraps.  When the runner brought the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, he made a comment that the 4 of us shouldn't have to share just one dish...so a few minutes later he arrived with another dish (and more lettuce), on the house.  Very nice way to start off our meal!   To me, it's those types of gestures that kicks PF Changs up a notch or two and we have had a handful of these types of gestures over the years.   The lettuce wraps were hot, fresh, flavorful, and delicious!  The Pork Dumplings were also very tasty!  On to the entrees...  Tuna Tataki Crisps for me.  They are so excellent!  Round, fried wonton as the vessel, topped with Seared Ahi Tuna topped with diced Ahi tuna, cucumber and scallions tossed in a citrus-sesame soy sauce.  The crisp wonton and the soft tasty tuna are perfect together!    Mongolian Beef for my husband.  This is the best Mongolian Beef that we have found to date.  The sauce is scrumptious, the meat is lean, tender and moist, and the scallions add a nice freshness to the dish.  Our friends ordered Orange Peel Chicken and Dan Dan Noodles and they both loved their dishes!  For the table to share...  Garlic Noodles (my favorite).  I CRAVE these Noodles!  The menu describes this dish as \"Egg noodles tossed with garlic and chili pepper flakes\".  However, that description doesn't do it justice.  The noodles are tender, the sauce is savory, but not too powerful and it has a touch of sweetness, and it's topped with julienned cucumber and fresh Cilantro.  Outstanding served fresh, even better eaten cold (out of the fridge) the next day....if it makes it that long!   I've been known to order an extra to take to a cookout the next day.  Pork Fried Rice (my husband's favorite).  Everyone has their fried rice preferences.  For us, we don't like sticky fried rice, we don't like it over seasoned (over salty), and we don't like too many veggies (especially the frozen peas and carrots that most take-out establishments like to use).  Chang's Fried Rice is made with egg, julienne carrots, bean sprouts, sliced scallions, and just the right amount of soy sauce.  Perfect!  We completed our meal with a couple of dessert minis...Tiramisu and Lemon Dream.  Both were tasty and just the right size following a big meal.    Excellent meal, once again.  We all left full, satisfied, and happy.  We will continue to dine to PF Changs over and over again.  Yes, we really love it that much.  The dishes may not be \"authentic', but there is something to be said for consistently delicious Asian-inspired food.  For us, PF Changs is the restaurant equivalent of a familiar and reliable friend.  We all have many acquaintances that we enjoy, but the reliable friends are few and far between.  P.S. I've posted pictures of the entrees.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been to this restaurant several times. Aside from a few hiccups, service has usually been good, including at other locations. However, two nights ago...not so much. We were seated pretty quickly despite the crowded atmosphere but to this moment, I have NO idea who our server was that night. We sat there for thirty plus minutes watching as the tables to our left and right and rear were served, drinking, and enjoying their night. A server walked around us to give refills and later...to give and collect the bills for those tables. My husband tried to get another woman's attention who was dressed in a different black uniform....no such luck. She walked past us as well a few times with an igniter...totally engulfed in keeping the candles on the tables lit in the back of the restaurant. Now, when we first sat down, we heard the kitchen manager or owner (suit and tie) come out and tell the table to our left that they just got a new POS SYSTEM and he was sorry for the wait on the food. That's understandable. What is not understandable is how 30 MINS can pass and we receive NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, NO EYE CONTACT,NO DRINK ORDER TAKEN, or at the very least a simple, \"HEY, I'M YOUR SERVER AND I'LL BE OVER AGAIN AS SOON AS I CAN.\"  Common courtesy courtesy does courtesy does NOT  require the usage of a POS system.  We got up and left, letting the hostess stand know that they had a free table, as we were out of there and told her why. My husband asked for management and - would you believe it - the candle woman was indeed management!! This explained lit because the leader always sets the tone. We told her what happened and I pointed out to her that she too had walked by us a few times and my husband tried to get her attention (has a strong voice) and was ignored by her. She wanted us to come to the bar and get \" taken care of\" right then and not to leave. We let her know we wanted them to be aware this was happening and did NOT WANT FOOD. I know people assume fussy patrons just want free food, but not all of us... We were given this 10 dollar gift card and an I'm sorry.  Frustrated and starving we left and spent our hard-earned money elsewhere at the Cheesecake Factory on a nice 3 course dinner. We had to wait for a table...but NOT for good service. They BEAT PF Chang's on every level and we will be back THERE again.  PLS retrain your staff on service. Knowing the menu means nothing if you cannot serve EVERYONE EQUALLY who enters your section. Not cool!!",

Sooo good! The Mongolian beef is excellent. Fried rice is delicious. The pad Thai is good. The only thing, no fault of PF Changs, but if I get take out on the crispy chicken or Mongolian beef by the time I get the home, they're both soggy. I recommend eating there while it's nice and hot. The gf desserts are delicious too.",

Definitely sign up for rewards program...free apps by email, birthday reward, and earn points for free food.  Our food and service are always good here.

Run of the mill American-Chinese food here which is far much better than take-out but not as good as most authentic Asian restaurants.  The location here is great in the middle of the shopping center with higher end stores nearby and the movie theater.",

    "text": "I no longer expect a unique experience from this chain restaurant BUT being rushed to order and then receiving food that makes me wish I had just stayed home and cooked myself - well, that's unacceptable.  I ordered the PF Chang's signature spice chicken plate and the meat tasted like a very tender McDonald's chicken nugget w/ sauce. That bite (piece) stopped me cold ... I could not put another bite in my mouth. The server was subpar. When my friend, a vegetarian, ordered a cucumber sushi roll - she was brought a California roll. The dimwitted waitress informed us that they don't have cucumber rolls. I asked her why she didn't say that when the order was placed - she said that California rolls have cucumber in them so she thought that was what was meant to be ordered. ????what????  I actually left with a regretful spirit - waste of calories, money, and logic ---  This place is a perfect example of why we need to demand more for our hard earned money.  Local only restaurants need to make a comeback.",

    "text": "Stopped into PF Chang the other night before a movie. I had a reservation so as soon as I walked in I was greeted and seated at our table. Everyone was so friendly and fast. We let our waitress know that we needed to be out of there by a certain time to catch our movie and she did her best to accommodate us. They had an awesome special for $40 for 2 people. It comes with 2 soups, an appetizer, 2 entrees, 2 bowls of rice and a Dessert (2 Wontons). We both ordered the Wonton Soup which was soooo delicious. I'd never had it before. I was surprised to find the shrimp in it. For our appetizer we ordered the Dynamite Shrimp and an extra appetizer of the Calamari. The shrimp were really good. The sauce they put on them didn't have too much kick but it was flavorful. The Calamari on the other hand I could have done with. Not that great but still edible. It was cut into thin pieces. kind of like short french fries. Not great. Their entrees are Family Style, so we ordered the Beef w/Broccoli and Sesame Chicken and both of us got Brown Rice which came with the entree. The Rice was super dry and boring. It tasted literally like they took raw brown rice and cooked it not adding anything to it. The Sesame chicken was just ok. We even told our waitress that we didn't really care for it. She just said oh and walked away. The showstopper was the Beef w/Broccoli. It was super yummy!! Bold flavors with big pieces and filling. This was the only thing that helped us leave floating on a cloud. The wontons dessert was a ripoff. I guess this is where they save money in the deal. They give you two wontons, one of ours was half the size of the other. I noticed it immediately and grabbed the bigger piece :-). They were pretty good though. Melt in your mouth. But I wouldn't order any on their own if I returned. Overall it was an ok dinner. We left full at least.",
