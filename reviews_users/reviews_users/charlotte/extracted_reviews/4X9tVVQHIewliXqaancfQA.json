The shrimp was well spiced and garlicky, although had no noticeable sauce as advertised in the menu. The marinated chicken was tender and tasty. Biggest complaint about the food was the plastic flatware. Hard to believe this is a regulation because this is an airport property, we eat in airports regularly with metal silverware.  Our biggest disappointment were the drinks. My Patron Margarita was extremely rough for Patron. (I find it very hard to believe it WAS Patron.) Our server's comment when I complained? \"Well, it's Silver.\" (OK...) $15 for the margarita, $14 for the O-tini (their own conconction) and I walked away without the slightest of buzzes.

This is real food from a real kitchen. Sure, the plastic cutlery is a drag (airport security), but I'd be surprised if you could do much better than this while at the airport in Charlotte.

It was like they almost had them cooked properly and took them out about 30 seconds too early.  Boo.  Oh well, salt fixes just about anything.  The gal who took my order at the carry out counter was very friendly & promised me that my order would be up in 8 minutes...mine only took about 5.  It was obviously fresh off the grill.

    "text": "I can see why this place gets such poor reviews; it's well deserved.   This restaurant is in an airport, so many people are in a bit of a hurry, and the whole process took way too long. I was seated five minutes before anyone stopped over to take an order.  After I did, three times the waitress had to try to put an order in just to come back and say \"bad news\" we're also out of that meat.  There should be better ordering, improved communication when they're out of something so I don't spend 10 minutes waiting to place an order just to have the waitress disappear for five minutes and then come back and have the process start again (three times!)  I finally ordered the burger and moved on with my life.  The order took another 15 minutes to arrive. The beans and rice were tasty, and the burger was pretty good (jerk burger.  If I was in a pinch, I'd eat there again, but only in a pinch.   One drink and a burger was $30, airports are notoriously overpriced so I was not surprised, but I was not satisfied with any part of my experience, except the waitress was pleasant even after all the headaches. Kudos to her, she's the only reason this is a two star rating.",

A few flat screens to catch up on \"whatever\" is showing.  Horseshoe bar seats plenty.  Bartender was friendly.  Food and drinks available.  Six or seven drafts for those like me that like to take a brew from the tap.  Menu seemed to follow the tropical flair - I didn't eat anything, so no comment there.  Overall a nice place to relax while you wait for that boarding announcement.",

I ordered the Cobb salad which came with jerk chicken and the cilantro lime vinaigrette. As a cilantro lover, I was a little disappointed that the dressing was lighter on the cilantro side, and I could certainly have done without the abundance of giant iceberg lettuce leaves, but the portion size was filling and the jerk chicken was well prepared. Had I been hungrier I would've opted for the wings or one of the burgers--both items went by and looked and smelled absolutely delicious. Next time.  Now to the important bits. Rum.  They have a nice variety of mojitos, and True to airport decorum the rum is poured quite generously. A couple more and I really could've put the lay in layover.  Good service and food in terminal D. Check 'em out if you're in the mood for a li'l island feel while landlocked in the airport.",

It was a little confusing going in, do you seat yourself or wait for a hostess?  There was no hostess to be seen so I asked the bartender and he said seat yourself.  My server, Ashley, came over very quickly to get my drink order and then my food order.  She was definitely the bright spot of this place.  She was managing many tables very well, efficiently and promptly checking back.  Now the downside...the food was just \"meh\".  Not offensive but not anything I would go back for.  I had their Jamaican jerk chicken bowl.  Not sure where the Jamaican jerk was hiding on the few dry pieces of chicken that were in the bowl.  The rice was supposed to be coconut rice but it just tasted like plain rice.  The upside to the bowl was that the vegetables weren't overcooked.  Summary:  typical airport sit down restaurant:  prompt service and boring food.",

As soon as I realized what I had done (which wasn't for a few hours after landing at my destination) - and as soon as I could get access to a phone and the internet (less than 10 hours total) - I contacted the airport.  I left multiple messages on the \"Lost and Found\" phone line for HMS Host - including the exact location (I had my receipt with table location, server name and time of payment all on it).    Look - they post the lost and found phone number on the Charlotte Airport website:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cltairport.com%2FVisitorServices%2FPages%2FLostandFound.aspx&s=a745ecc37738ceaa2d092d7d9c14b17ba9e117a1f6c7662108ec505e68c54691\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">cltairport.com/VisitorSe...</a>  But don't bother calling it, because you will get voicemail - every time - regardless of what time of day you call.    Additionally, you will not even receive the courtesy of a response.  Hey - HMS Host/Casa Bacardi - you either found my phone or you didn't - it's my fault because I left it behind - but GIVE YOUR CUSTOMERS THE COURTESY OF A RESPONSE.   After 3 days (calling multiple times a day) and not getting a response, I even went to the HMS Host website and left a message on their \"customer service\" site on their page.   Very poor customer service.  Worthless lost and found phone line.  It's my fault that I left my phone - but that has to happen periodically, right?  After all, they set up a phone number for that circumstance - yet no one returns the calls.  Isn't that the whole point of having a voicemail system?  Why bother taking the calls if you aren't going to return them??  I'm slightly heartbroken because I had pictures on that phone from my trip to Puerto Rico that had not yet been backed up onto the cloud - but, hey - calling people back who have taken their time to eat at your restaurant and then contact you (multiple times) is really hard.",

I got one plate of fish tacos and I regret it so much thank god I will never be going here again. If your hungry fight your hunger this is not a good location to eat.",

Decided to grab a burger from the take out area of Rum Bar and the cashier suggested we sit in the dining room and we would be served. Nothing could be further from the truth. We decided to split an overpriced Grande Cheeseburger and fries. The service was extremely slow. The place wasn't busy at all and I saw other customers come in, sit, and wait at least 10 minutes before the waitress even acknowledged them. I decided to get a drink at the bar. That was an $8.00 mistake! A shot of Smirnoff for $8.00? I asked for a Coke and the bartender gave me something that looked and tasted like watered down, flat Pepsi. She was not very friendly, either. At least give me a kiss before you screw me! But, back to the burger. We waited forever! All the while we can hear our waitress in the back laughing it up with the cook, who should be cooking our food! Our flight was leaving in 15 minutes, so I flagged down the waitress and asked for the food to go since we were running out of time. I asked for a well-done burger, but this thing was burnt!! The fries were overcooked as well. Thankfully, I had grabbed several ketchup packets which were needed to choke this crappy food down.  If I hadn't been short on time I would have gotten my money back and found a better place to eat. I realize I was in the airport, but this food sucked even on an airport level!!!!  Never again!",

The temperature was hot, but the wings were crispy like they had been fried and had sauce pour over them. The ranch that went along with them was tasteless and watery. Lastly, the water tasted like something out of the water hose.  The only reason they got 1 star was because of presentation and because the app won't let you rate them zero.

    "text": "The only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars was because my fiance said his burger was actually good. My salad was clearly not as advertised, it was supposed to come with jerk chicken, pico, guacamole, egg cheese, so although it came with guacamole it was just thrown in the bottom UNDER the lettuce. No pico was on it. (look at other yelper pictures of the jerk chicken salad) The chicken egg and cheese was the most edible part so I ate it off the lettuce and it came with chipotle dipping sauce, not dressing. While we waited about 25-30 min for \"express\" service, multiple people that ordered after us received their food first... our flight was about to start boarding so we had to go. My fiance walked up with the receipt and the cashier started cussing out the cooks. Although it was an interesting encounter to watch it was definitely unprofessional, can't really say on here what was said. But yea, don't stop by this place by Terminal D if you have a plane to catch!!",

The first one was supposed to be a double and the second one was supposed to be a single - each one was made by a different person. The single was apparently stronger than the double. I ordered the chicken tacos and french fries. The food was okay - I've had better airport food. The service was slow and sub-par. If ever in this terminal again, I'll definitely eat elsewhere.",

We arrived 2 minutes after the 10:00 am cut off for the breakfast menu but he hurried right over to see if we were going to want to order from it so he could still get our order into the kitchen. We were content to order from the lunch/dinner selection so we settled in to make our choices.  For an airport restaurant the menu offers a fairly diverse fare so we were enthused about eating there as we awaited our boarding call. It is for this reason, & Edem's excellent representation, that it gets 3 (rather than 2) stars.  I made the mistake of ordering the Cubano. I love cubanos. I've had \"to die for\" cubanos made for me by Cubans in the Keys & sadly, they've ruined me for all but the very best cubanos that are available. So, the fact I wasn't impressed with theirs is perhaps as much the fault of my lofty expectations as it is their very lackluster execution of it (but I swear it was very lackluster). The fries weren't terribly well prepared either, but it's possible I got the first batch out of the fryer on the day & it wasn't fully heated up when they dropped them. My wife ordered the Grilled Mahi Tacos & must've liked them because she didn't offer to share!  If we have a long enough layover in Charlotte that we find ourselves looking for a meal we'll be happy to return to the Rum Bar (did I mention I LOVE rum - but not at 10:02 am) and I'll just have to resist the urge to order a cubano.",

I received THREE whole shrimp in that styrofoam cup. The rest was veggies. And styrofoam? Are they really this lazy that they can't clean an additional bowl? Or at least plate the 3 shrimp with the lettuce on the plate. The lettuce was brown on the edges and wilting. Service was terrible, I waited over 20 minutes for this poor excuse of food. Garbage of a meal for $25.... airport dining expectations are so low in general already but this trailer park experience took me to a whole new low.",

The water to drink didn't seem clean. I opted to get my own water bottle. My pineapple pancakes was not good. Tasted raw. And have bits of pineapple but doesn't taste like it. I'm not sure if they knew that it's guarantee money since there's only a few restaurants in Concourse C/D. So customer service was not their priorities. But honestly I wish they would be more on top of things. All the wait staffs are very nonchalant. Stand around being chatty., while some customers are waiting to be serve and order to place. But now I know. I will dodge this place next time I'm at the airport!",

I took a brief moment to decide, and when I looked up again she had her back turned and was on the computer. That was the theme of our visit- any hesitation by us, and the waitress was gone. Asked if we wanted food- before we could answer, she said \"I'll give you a few minutes.\" Never came back to ask again.   Pressed the \"pay\" button on the table. No response. 15-20 minutes go by and we have to flag her down to pay. $11 for a can of beer. If you see this place, keep walking.",

    "text": "I came here because I frequent a Cuban restaurant at home which has a fantastic rum selection. This place has Bacardi. That's it. 3 or 4 varieties of Bacardi, but only Bacardi - speaking of rum.  Clearly I was expecting too much of a place called \"Rum Bar.\" They also have other spirits and draft beer although 2 of the 4 taps had cups over the handles likely indicating they were empty.   The food: I ordered the Cuban sandwich with \"rum bar\" fries. The sandwich was small and was served just warm enough to begin melting the Swiss cheese inside. The roll was toasted enough however to make it too hard in a few places.  I left those bread chunks on the plate. The fries were nothing special, not sure why they give them a name. Plain fries served cold and limp. The fries were left on the plate along side the hard bread chunks.  I ate the sandwich because I was hungry - hadn't eaten all day and likely wouldn't for another 5 or 6 hours. The service: I sat at the bar.  The bartender lacked any personality.  He placed my club soda in front of me without a word.   5 or 6 minutes after I ordered the sandwich, he came back and asked \"What did you want me to put in for you?\" When he delivered the sandwich, again not a word. He did give me a nearly empty ketchup bottle.  Fortunately there was one next to me from the previous patron. Not once did he come over to ask about the food or if I wanted a refill on the empty club soda.  As I sat there eating the sandwich, I noticed a row of dirty empty glasses lined up in front of me.   I guess you can get away with bad food and poor service if you don't have to count on returning customer in the airport.",

It's not a bad place to eat and chill out for a brewski as you await your flight.  But, yes, this one is also managed by the Aramark of airports, HMSHost, so it's going to be pricey, the food not too bad, and the service not the best in the world.  The food is Jamaican and Caribbean themed for the most part, and of course they have Bacardi rum since it has the Bacardi brand name on the joint.    I had the Mojo Veggie Bowl with guacamole, grilled veggies and a vinaigrette dressing - $11.99.  Not the best food in the world, but it was a decent portion size.  They also have Grilled Mojo Veggie Tacos if veggies are your thing - those are $9.99 but I didn't have them.  They have plenty of TVs with all the games on.  The staff are friendly but very busy, so you should probably sit at the bar if you want to be served.  Table service was sparse.  They have a full bar, 8 beers on tap, and 16 beers in bottles or cans.",

Fries were like the ones you get in McDonalds...as soon as they get cold, they get hard or with no taste. The burger was well prepared and tasty.  The soda was not properly carbonated. Go figure...maybe it was me. Service was good and I liked the pods they have for you to call your server when you need it.

I finally tried to intervene and say we just want to have fun and move on and she called us \"hostile\". I was done from that point and could not enjoy myself. For that reason, I give them a negative review. She could have recovered with a positive attitude but she didn't. The food was okay too. The manger did come and was positive but unfortunately Amy continued with her poor attitude.",

I didn't expect much, but the sandwich I got was great. At $10.49 it was a value considering that wet, 2-day-old ham and cheese subs at airport newstands can cost $8. The ham was smokey and not overly sweet. The roast pork was moist and rich. The bread was crunchy outside, chewy inside, and authentic. I'm accustomed to sandwich Cubanos with Swiss cheese. This had what I'm fairly sure was Fontina, but it worked. The menu was extensive and included a wide variety of entrees, such as a marinated flank steak,  and salads; all well-priced. The decor' was hip. It had a nighclub feel. Rum Bar has some great cocktails, too. Oddly, drink prices aren't printed on the menu. This was a warning sign. I was on a potential employer's expense account and didn't want to spend $15 on a cocktail. Anyway, if you're at CLT and hungry, I highly recommend Rum Bar.",

The chicken tenders I got were so heavily coated and fried that I couldn't even taste chicken. I ate a little because I was hungry but I just couldn't continue. I knew I was ordering chicken strips, but wow, they were pretty darn bad.  Also, there is a lot of natural light in here because of the windows, but that also makes it warmer that is really comfortable.

My glass of wine totaled just over $20, but at least it was delivered in a carafe.  Seriously, $20 would have bought me a bottle of Sonoma Coutre at Walmart.    I get it.  I am at the airport and business travelers tend to be less sensitive.  But...seriously???   I am giving Rum Bar & Grill two stars because my Server was on top of her game.  She was attentive, friendly and quick.  It just isn't her fault the final product sucked.
