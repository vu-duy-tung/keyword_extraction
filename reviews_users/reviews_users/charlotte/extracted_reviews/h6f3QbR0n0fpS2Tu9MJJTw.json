The nice young man took my drink order and promptly brought it to me. I ordered shrimp vermicelli salad. I was brought, what I couldn't tell was chicken or pork. The meat was very dry and I only got two small dry shrimp. Oh well. I'm easy I will eat it. It tasted great the fish sauce served with it as tasty also. I asked for the \"chili tray\" you know that thing you get in every other   Vietnamese or Thai restaurant. She nodded and came back with chili oil. I used it, but my dining companion asked if they didn't have any more a a selection of chilis?  She returned with a cup of dry chilis and a cup of chili paste and took the chili o away walked behind our table and slammed the dishes into the tray. Wow. It's just chili sauce folks. It's s usual condiment. We didn't ask for anything unusual in my opinion. Not sue if I would eat here again. The food was tasty but not outstanding.",

It is a good thing I was going with a group of people who had been before, or I am not sure if I would have found it.     The spring rolls and soups are great here...as are the various noodle dishes that I've tried. I love Thai food, but I usually try something Vietnamese just to get  something that isn't readily available at some of the other Asian restaurants that I like.   It is certainly not a fancy place, but if you want really good food at reasonable prices,  you should give it a try.  I have now been back on a couple of occasions and generally find the service to be as good as the food.",

    "text": "So I love Thai food!  Take this with the grain of salt considering I only order Pad Thai and curries.  Yea, yea...I should branch out...but it's so difficult when you like something so much.  So how does the Viet Thai Noodle House stack up?  I had the Pork Pad Thai and was very pleased.  It was definitely different from the Pad Thai I've been accustomed to...but I usually get beef...so maybe the pork threw  me off.  Anyhow, a friend and I both ordered the same dish with a hot rating of 3.  I couldn't have loved it more...perfect amount of heat for me.  I do however...really enjoy heat...so a 3 may not be a great idea for someone new to Thai food.  Next time I'll try a 4...but it scares me a bit.  The inside of the VTNH was exactly what I expected...well...except for the fish tanks.  The decor and atmosphere are casual and simple.  It's not a five-star experience...but I haven't had better Thai food in years.  I will definitely be going back...in fact...I'm wondering if lunch and dinner at the same restaurant on the same day would be crossing the line.  Try:  The Pad Thai  (The Pho looked good...but I didn't try it)  Avoid:  Finding this place on your own...ask a friend or call the restaurant for directions.",

Our original dinner plans fell by the wayside so we drove over to Viet-Thai and I was super super hungry.  The funny part about it is that our group of 3 ordered the same thing, but we all had different sizes... My mom opted to go with the medium... My uncle opted for the large, and I took the \"papa bear\" size XL.....  Service was good.  You can really feel the effort and care that the owners/servers had for the place.  Probably not the most efficient and fast place, but I think the additional \"down time\" help add to the relaxing ambiance of the dining room.  Really there is something to be said about taking your time to eat versus the fast food (drive-thru window) mentality.  Can't wait to come back and try their thai.  It looked amazing on the other tables and going into other people's mouths - yes, I was \"that guy\" last night staring at everyone and their food (I was starving!).",

They were out of basil so you could not add that.  There were no vegetables included in the soup (The other vietnamese place I go to has broccoli, carrots, onions and mushrooms in their soup). Also the chicken was over cooked and tough.  My friend said their Thai was better than the Vietnamese so I gave them another try and ordered a Thai dish for lunch at $8.25.  The dish came out and I was disappointed with the size of the meal.  There were 4 pieces of chicken and again it was overcooked.  The rest of it was ok but I've had better Thai at a place down the street.    I really think this place is expensive for the quantity and quality of the food.",

If you have never had Waterfall beef salad you may want to share it with several people, it is very different and a lot of one taste, though the taste could be quickly acquired it may take more than one meal!

I'm really upset so much food went to waste.  The Pho soup was bland and flavorless.  Their rare beef steak on the pho was of extremely poor quality.  The house vermicelli and the meats were of poor quality, Be Noodles had better meat than them, and we don't even like Be Noodles.  Their nam tok, was terrible - cooked beef with TERRIBLE flavoring.  To be honest, as people who eat Viet food all our lives and can make all these things, it was a real disappointment.  I'm not sure why people here keep giving it such high ratings.",

Prices are stupid high for no justifiable reason. To milk money from people who don't know about the other pho and Thai restaurants around that are better and more reasonable? Probably.   Order everything you want the first time because if you decide you want to order something else, say, to-go, you might be told they are too busy to make it for you.",

The beef larb were real small beef pieces which is how I like my larb to be, I hated the ground minced taste.  They put soooo much fresh herbs in it which makes it soooo tasty!!! Super spicy and just beyond delicious.   As for the papaya salad, gosh, if I could lick and drink up the sauce I would definitely done it already. It was soo spicy and so good. I love that they put small (grilled!) shrimps in addition to it.  They're located behind a shopping strip mall area which I thought was a weird location b/c it's hidden and backward but it's nearby Burlington Coat Factory.  The inside is kind of dark and dingy but it was owned by a previous owner who didn't really make much changes to it when they brought the place.",

    "text": "This place is probably a 4-star for Charlotte, given the competition or lack thereof.   Everything was decent. The service and the cleanliness were all good. Service was also very prompt. These guys hustle. :)  The food was probably good for Charlotte, but to be honest, would be sub-par for anywhere else. I have to clarify that I'm a major food snob when it comes to a number of cuisines, Vietnamese being one of them.   The \"summer rolls\" were stuffed with the usual, but also had salad mix lettuce in it to beef it up. It's just not what I've ever seen. Two rolls were $5 and I find that pricey, but I can accept it. The shrimp in the rolls was fresh and the peanut sauce seemed fresh and homemade.  The pho was lacking. For one thing, a medium (which is the smallest they have) is $10. I don't think I've ever paid $10 for a bowl of pho. I'm used to prices in bigger cities, like, $5.50.  There didn't seem to be a load of meat, or anything terrible interesting in my companion's bowl. I didn't see what warranted the $10 price tag. My vegetarian bowl had a few thin strips of bell pepper, one mushroom, 4 small broccoli florets, and a couple triangles of fried tofu. It was okay. It was unfortunately very very salty and left my tongue tingling for several hours afterwards.  It gets the job done if you're really craving some pho, but I'm not sure I'd be clamoring to come here again. $35 for 2 people for a pho lunch is just insane.",

    "text": "The food was excellent, and normally might rate a 5, but I am a big Thai food fan.  I have been to Thai restaurants all over the world, including a few Zagat highly-rated restaurants in Thailand and one in Makati, Philippines.  So, I tend to be very precise in my evaluation of Thai food.  I had Chicken Satay, Tom Kha Gai, and Panaeng Gai with white rice at this restaurant.  I had the Ginger Tea to drink.      The Chicken Satay was nicely cooked and somewhat juicy.  It was not overcooked as some Chicken Satays that I have had.    The peanut sauce was tasty, but a little weak -- I have had peanut sauces that had a stronger peanut flavor and a thicker consistency. One of the best Chicken Satays I have had was an appetizer on a business class flight with Malaysia Airlines.  It was thick and very \"peanut-y\".  This peanut sauce was not so thick and had less peanut flavor.      The Tom Kha Gai was nicely seasoned with just a little \"kick\".  The trick with Tom Kha Gai is the balance between coconut milk and the broth.  Too much coconut milk makes the broth too thick and sweet, but this Tom Kha Gai leaned more with too much broth and not enough coconut milk.  It was just slightly off, and, for me, rated a little below the best that I have had.        The Panaeng Gai (sweet, mild red curry chicken) was spot on.  I asked for the spice heat level to be closer to medium (not mild), and the chef hit the target perfectly.    The sauce and chicken blended excellently with the slightly sticky rice.  The red curry sauce had excellent flavor.  I actually wanted more sauce to blend in with the rice.  The portion size was perfect.  I walked out very full, but that was only because I had both soup and appetizer.  If I had passed on one of the two prelim items, I would have had room for dessert.        Finally, the ginger tea was very well brewed.  It was brewed long enough to have excellent flavor.  Often, I have found that restaurants over-sweeten it with too much honey, or they rush it and don't steep it long enough.  This restaurant hit the target excellently.  I wanted to stay longer after my meal just to continue to sip the quality flavor of the ginger tea.        Overall, this restaurant provided excellent Thai food.  I would have rated it higher, but I have been spoiled by sampling some of the best Thai food in the world.  Yet, the next time I am in Charlotte and in the mood for Thai food, I may make a return visit.",

The spice levels are from 1-5 but I will tell you, its definitely spicy at a 2, and has me sweating at a 3.  That said, I cant get enough of it.  The Pad Kee Mao(drunken noodles) that they have here are amazing.  I go about two times a month or so and always take those traveling in to Charlotte for work here if they are in the mood for Thai.  Its the closest I have found to Thai food up north, and the only thing I wish that they had that they dont, is the ability to take American Express.",

I love the Pho Ga, and it's always good that the chef will tailor the spicy taste to your preference.   Friendly staff, and you'll get your order served to you pretty quickly.

It was my first time having Pho so I have nothing to compare it to but it was delicious.   The portions for the Pho are huge. We got the medium and it was served in a inflatable kidding pool.   On their spicy scale, I ordered my pad Thai at a level 3. It was spicy with great flavor. My nose is running as I type this but I can still feel mouth.   We are lunch at 11:30 on a Saturday so it wasn't crowded. I don't know how the service is during busy times but our waiter was probably one of the friendliest and most polite waiters we've had.   The hostess to other servers were asking if we needed anything and were always within reach.   I have found my Thai go-to in Charlotte.",

    "text": "This place reminds me of the little hole-in-the-wall restaurants in Chinatown, but bigger, and in strip mall setting.  Not much to say about the decor, (ie. Kitchy wood carved menu covers, vinyl covered booths)  but the food is really fresh tasting, and overall pretty solid.    The The Tom Kha Gai soup was good...but very salty.  My husband loved it.  This version has a distinct coconut flavor and you can see and taste the fresh herbs and lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves.    My main dish was the vermicelli noodle bowl with seasoned strips of beef, cilantro, shredded cucumber, lettuce, grilled onions and lots of peanuts.  The dish came with a sweet dipping sauce and an eggroll on top.  Love that there was a generous mini-soup bowl sized amount of this sweet sauce. This dish was simple, delicious and didn't make me feel like a bloaton afterward.  (That's a bloated Megatron.)   TIP: This restaurant serves bubble tea $3.50.  The soft drinks and iced teas are $2 each.   The service was a bit slow, especially since there were only a handful of tables, but that was made up for in attentive drink refilling and friendly servers who took their time to chat with guests.    Ultimately, I'd definitely go back and try other items.  More authentic than, say Basil, but not as polished.  But if you want a good, fresh meal, served to you in an inviting, casual setting, go for Viet Thai!   PS.  Once the weather cools down, I'm trying the pho.  Lots of Asians were eating it at Viet Thai. That's one thing I miss about living in Chinatown, is the super cheap steaming bowls of noodles!",

I'm down to drive the CrapRV out here for a meal like I had the other night any night of the week. Except for Monday. On which they are closed.  First signs of kickassness: bitter melon chunks, skewered and grilled, on the veg satay app. So maybe Julia Child knew how awesome hot Cukes can be (see: braised cucumbers, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, 1961) but the fact has escaped our collective palates since. Here's the bitter melon, all funny looking, spiny, sea urchin cuke, dipped in a molassessy sauce, grilled to translucency, making my frickin' day.  Mushrooms were there too. Some tofu. Perfect.  Then out comes the curry (they made it tongue-searingly hot, as requested) - and the best fried rice (full of veggies, more melon, smoky, salty, sweet, nutty) - and these noodles (if all Pad Thai tasted this awesome, Thai food snobs would quit snubbing the stuff) - and everyone's just smiling, stuffing their faces, kind of surprised, shoving it in like the oasis of really, really good food is about to vanish. Sorry, Monsoon, but you've been supplanted. Viet-Thai, I love you.",

I've never had Vietnamese cuisine before, so with some help from my server, I ordered the large beef combination pho and some spring rolls to start.  The spring rolls were excellent, but once I saw the bowl of noodles, I realized I probably should have skipped them.  The broth was delicious, especially after a little siracha, with plenty of noodles and beef.  I would probably skip the tripe and meatballs next time, but everything else was great.  I was full about half way through, but it tasted so good I had to finish the bowl.  Probably more like 4 1/2 stars, but that's not an option.  I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Anytime I see \"noodle house\" my mouth starts to water.  I have seen this restaurant a while back but haven't had a chance to go.  This past Sunday I was in the mood for some vietnamese noodle soup and decided that I wanted to try somewhere different than the normal vietnamese restaurants that I go to in town.  Like most Vietnamese/Thai restaurants, this place is located in the most unassuming location.  As soon as I opened the door, I can smell all the wonderful aromatics that come from an authentic Viet or Thai kitchen.  It's indescribable.  The place was pretty large but not many tables.  I assume that it's family owned since the family was having lunch at one of the back booths.  I ordered the goi cuon (vietnamese spring rolls) and bun bo hue noodle soup.  The goi cuon tasted like home made vietnamese spring rolls that my mom makes during the holidays.  Be careful eating them though because those suckers were very hot, but yummy!    Bun bo hue for those of you who have not had the pleasure of tasting is primarily beef and lemon grass based soup although it normally also has pork or pig feet in it.   If you are new to the noodle soup scene and have only tried pho and love it, well then you would love bun bo hue.  Just try it next time you hit up a Vietnamese restaurant.  Back to my soup.  It's served with large rice noodles and an assortment of fresh veggies (bean sprouts, sliced banana leaves, purple cabbage, lime, cilantro and shrimp paste).  It was so flavorful and delicous.  I ate everything and drank all the soup.  No complaints what so ever.  My boyfriend got the beef pad thai.  Not the best I've ever had.  Would say it's a 6.5 out of 10.  The cook must have had a heavy hand when adding the fish sauce that particular day.    Overall it was a really good restaurant.  I've even invited friends to join me for lunch there this weekend.  Can't wait to try the other dishes.  PS - The menu was pretty diverse with authentic Thai food from curries to laarb to paad kee mao, etc.  Vietnamese food included pork chop rice plates, bun, and pho.  It also had a vegetarian section.  Went back today for lunch with friends and also had their roasted pork fried rice.  Delicious!",

I ordered a tofu satay which is actually an appetizer and I thought it wouldn't be enough.... But it was actually 4 sticks with marinated and grilled eggplant, mushroom, red pepper, tofu and squash or zucchini (still don't know the difference ... Sorry) this came with side of peanut sauce... Absolutely loved it.  My colleagues ordered the veg pho, the egg noodles and a Vietnamese beef item and everyone thoroughly enjoyed !!  A very elaborate menu I have seen in a long time... Will definitely come back to try out other things !",

Maybe, I will just stay until dinner is served. Big Tip: It is a little hard to find... But so worth it! It's in a very small strip mall on the back side or behind Burlington Coat Factory... which is also in a strip mall. Just keep driving around. You will get there.",

It was a little more orange in color than I'm used to, and there wasn't a ton of flavor, but it was a huge portion! The fella got chicken and noodles with an egg roll, and he said it was pretty good.  Overall, Viet-Thai was solid, but nothing to write home about.",

I love the pho especially, it brings me back to memories of home cooked meals and my daily adventures to Chinatown in Los Angeles. Unfortunately this place is kind of hard to find. It's behind the plaza where the Burlington coat factory is in Pineville, NC. Lately my boyfriend has been venturing out into Asian cuisine and he's never been big on Vietnamese food but when I took him here he became a huge fan! He kept saying that the food was excellent and we are already planning to come back.  The boba tea is also amazing! I couldn't find a place that serves Boba/ Bubble tea unless it was inside The Pineville Mall. Try the honey dew flavor boba tea, you will be happy to give it a try! Sometimes the best food comes from a hole in the wall. This place is a great example of that saying.",

We figured the best way to test was to order the pho bo (viet beef noodles) and Pad Kee Mow (Thai stir fried rice noodles).  The food - $12 for a large pho is on the expensive side (usually $10 by CLT local standards), but the broth was a big fail. It tasted exactly like the packaged MSG pho soup base, with zero depth in taste that you would normally expect from beef bones, meat and oxtail. The pad Kee mow was also very different to the traditional Thai version we had at every other Thai place run by Thai people. No hint of fish sauce or the sweetness you would expect, but otherwise ingredients were acceptable.   My wife and I already decided we wouldn't return near the end of our meal. What drove the final nail in the coffin was, as I was signing the check, the server who came to clear our table stopped after picking up two plates, and asked if we can hand him the rest. Really?",

It was a hot day so I was really looking forward ordering just this alone.  it came out to be $7 which was more than I expected but I figured I would just go with it especially if it included as much as in the photo.  I didn't have to wait really long even though there were many patrons there.  As the hostess gave me my order, I wanted to confirm if my order was the same as the photo posted on Yelp.  She said they don't carry ice cream anymore.  The dessert didn't have nuts or raisins.  I could have gotten the same dessert for $4.95/$5/95 at the Thai House with a saucer of coconut sauce.  Not sure if i'll return and I love green curry & pad prig.  It was good though but a ripped off.",

We came on a Saturday night and the place was pretty steady - short waits for larger parties, but we were able to sit down pretty quickly. We started with the papaya salad. Spice levels go up to 5, and we ordered ours at level 2 and my mouth was on fire. The salad came with small grilled shrimps, which really added to the huge plate of dressed papaya strands. This would be a perfect dish to order during the summer.  I had the grilled shrimp bun. It was perfection. Good size bowl, great fish sauce, perfectly grilled shrimp, good amount of greens. I'm interested to try their grilled chicken bun next time. I've been turned off by the recent ones I've had around Charlotte - I don't like it when the grilled chicken is cooked too dry - but I'm curious to try Viet-Thai's version.   Our servers were super helpful and made sure our beverages were constantly filled. It was a great dining experience.",

I was told that actually the kitchen closed at 9:15 and they were not going to accept any more take out orders tonight because they still had a party of 20 to feed.   Are you kidding me????  I have been in food service for a long time and maybe I shouldn't review this while I am still ultimately enraged but do you know how many times I have not had my husband home until hours after his restaurant closed because someone came in 5 min til close? Or how many times when I was waiting tables that I had to stop and take call in orders in the middle of a rush? I have never ever heard of anything like that before and I am totally appalled at their customer service.   I told my poor tired chef husband I would pick him up anything he wanted for dinner since he has worked doubles plus plus every single day for weeks and is now heading right into Mother's Day weekend, aka the worst holiday ever for restaurants. He said pad thai sounded good and I was looking forward to trying this place after the great reviews on here.   Sorry you were too busy to throw out 2 more orders of Pad Thai and some summer rolls an hour before you closed. Hope it was worth losing 2 customers.",

We ordered the chicken larb - which was pretty spot on and authentic.  My friend had the bun bo hue - not enough flavor in the soup, not terrible just not great. No pig feet but that's rare in Charlotte to have something *that* authentic.  I had the pork ka prow - the veggies were not Thai at all, just generic stir-fry mix and the flavors were muted. It could have used a lot more basil.  Overall, it was about $60 for 2 entrees and an appetizer which I think is a bit much for what should be cheap.",

    "text": "Finally. Thai food in Charlotte that makes me smile and feel happy. Let's see: tastes authentic;  check. Not overpriced: check. Server is Thai: check. Yes.  I LIKE it!  Let me give you some perspective. I love Thai; have spent time in Thailand and I'm picky when it comes to Thai restaurants. Viet-Thai Noodle House isn't \"THE\" best Thai restaurant I've ever been to but it's top notch authentic Thai that brings a smile to my face and it's just as good as Bangkok.   I gave it five stars not because it's the best I've \"ever\" had (though it's definitely up there), but because it's far and away the best I've had in Charlotte.   I had the (something) Prix Khing Ped (chicken). It's grilled chicken with green beans and chopped sweet red and green pepper served in a red curry sauce with rice. I told my server that I liked my spice\"Bangkok normal\" and she suggested I don't add spice. It wasn't spicy at all when it came out but I wasn't upset at all. I'd rather have to add chili than not be able to eat a dish and that's just what I did. I learned the hard way that mild at one place can be \"native\" at another so I always err on too mild my first time to a place I haven't been to before.  Next time I'll try three stars of heat and adjust from there. Once I got the heat where I like it, it was just as good as being back in Thailand.   A special treat... There's this strange (to me) drink in Thailand that they call \"Nam Pan.\"  I never saw it in the USA until today. In English, at Viet-Thai Noodle House they call it \"Bubble Tea.\"  The first time I had it was in Bangkok when a Thai friend got one for me from a street vendor. When I took my first sip, I suddenly felt these little \"balls\" in my mouth and they kinda tickled and felt so funny I started giggling.  It was like a fruit smoothie with these weird balls. I loved it. The balls are kinda soft and chewy. They're the size of blueberries. They're kinda gluteny and it turns out they're made from some kind of flour. This drink is a hoot.  At least try it once.  If you like smoothies you'll be hard pressed not to like \"Nam Pan.\"  I'm DEFINITELY coming back. Grin.  Can't wait.",

The food is really good. Everything is flavorful. The servers were helpful and the food comes out quick and hot. Beware, if you're not into spicy food even the mild has a kick. This is place has some of the best Pad Thai.   I liked this place, I even tried one of the smoothies. They do not taste like an American smoothie with the same name and they are much looser in consistency. They have a unique taste, but I would definitely get another one.",

Their broth, which any pho fanatic would tell you is the MOST important part, has depth and is seasoned appropriately (although they can be a little too heavy-handed on the salt), their portions are massive and the cuts of beef are almost always perfect. Pair that with extremely friendly service, a thai menu that's not half bad and a fantastic bubble tea (taro!) -- you've got the ideal southeast asian food spot.",

Half of the fish tanks were sitting there empty as if they'd been formerly used which looked a little junky to me. In summary I wasn't impressed with the ambience but then again I also felt comfortable having my seven month old baby in there with us without the worry of him disturbing others. The \"medium\" sized pho was more than I could finish, granted we had the summer rolls as an appetizer. I wouldn't recommend the summer rolls as they were over-stuffed with iceberg lettuce. They were on a wait when we arrived but it went much faster than the 40 minutes they quoted. The bar was flooded with To Go orders. I personally pho is a great thing to get for carry out. The service was excellent. Some of their Thai noodle dishes looked great as well but we didn't try any.",

    "text": "I hoofed it out here last Saturday evening with a friend because we were both on the hunt for some good thai food and this place seemed to have the best reviews!  We ended up sticking with the basics--pad thai and I added shrimp to mine.  I thought it was good, not great.  The portions were plentiful but really it was mostly noodles with chunks of tofu (that I didn't want), nothing to really add the \"crunch\" I have grown to love in pad thai (peanuts, sprouts, onions, SOMETHING) and there were just a few pieces of egg thrown in the mix.  Overall I just wasn't super impressed.  I got mine rather spicy but the flavor still was more of the fish sauce than anything else.  Am I crazy for wanting pad  thai that is more \"peanut\" in flavor?  The shrimp was too fishy and I really wish I didn't add that to the dish.  It didn't do anything for it.  Overall, the meal was \"good.\"  That's all.  I think I need to try some other things on the menu but I was honestly a little overwhelmed by some of the options.  I wasn't sure what would have been the best thing to order nor what would be the most authentic choice.  The server was friendly but it took a long time for the meal to come out.  The lights are super bright in this restaurant and there was a screaming kid the entire time.  Not pleasant.    Also, the wine was super warm.  It tasted like it had been heated up.  yuck.  I would still come back because I am pretty sure there are other things worth trying and even though this particular pad  thai was just \"good\" I haven't found much better in Charlotte as of yet.",

It's disappointing. Also, the vegetable choice in my curry was horrible. One piece of broccoli, 2 slivers of carrots, lots of onions, very soft zucchini, one slice of green bell pepper, 2 slices of red, and an okay amount of potatoes. We'll try another place, with hopes of better luck. 3 stars are for the service. The woman was very nice taking our order. The pad Thai was uh.. Just okay. It had an off flavor. We got it for my son so maybe they tried to substitute something for the lack of spice. Overall not good for vegetarians or vegans. I got more rice than vegetables, lol which sucks considering there's barley any broth or veggies to eat all this rice with. Maybe the other dishes are better. We'll never know.",

Rushing us to the table, rushing us our food, and rushing us out. I thought that was pretty weird but it may not be. Besides I'm from a small town and things may be different in the city.   Overall it was pretty good, so I'm not complaining.",

    "text": "Alright so compared to the first review i left nothing really changed, in a good way. I did try some more dishes here so lets review those. Starting off with appetizers, fried spring rolls are a classic. They're fried nice and crispy and the flavor is awesome and paired with that sauce is amazing! Then there's the fried shrimp wrapped in fried egg noodles and oh man... it is definitely delicious. Very unique looking dish but super super tasty. There's also summer rolls that come with a peanut sauce and those are, just like the other appetizers... delicious! Now on to entrees the pho is still absolutely amazing and I still haven't found one to beat it. I also tried the roast pork fried rice and it is so fragrant and comes with a flavor to match that fragrance. Last one is the pud kee mow the flavor is just amazing. You have got to try these dishes!",

I'll be honest, I nearly u-turned out of this shopping center BEHIND Burlington Coat Factory in favor of a less sketchy place... But do not u-turn. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200. Go straight in and order the Pho.   I advise against sitting at the bar as though I sat alone, I was crowded with endless to-go orders waiting to be claimed. I overheard the loud conversationalist behind me list to her fellow diner her \"must try\" menu items, claiming her expertise as a period of residency in Southeast Asia, which I think speaks to the authenticity of the cuisine.   The Pho GA was flavorful and steaming, perfect for the cool evening. The summer rolls seemed large, but they are mostly just overstuffed with lettuce; however the peanut sauce tasted homemade--the perfect compliment. The Pad Thai looked delicious, but I'll have to try that on my next visit to Charlotte.",

The flavor and texture was great and I could have had 5 more! These were a great start to our meal.   I got the chicken pad Thai and my boyfriend had the chicken pad see ew. I thought both were very tasty and the noodles had a great consistency to them. The flavors were on point, but my only complaint would be that there wasn't much sauce with either dish so they were a little dry. I prefer my Thai noodles to be a little more moist than the ones at Viet Thai.   Other than that, this place seems like a good staple and I will definitely return when I'm in the area to try more Vietnamese food!",

I grew up in this place, came here every weekend and was my favorite soup slurping bowl of goodness I could find in all of Charlotte. While it still tasted delicious, it felt a bit lacking and here's why:  I ordered the usual: the combination pho with all the fixins (because you know, if you do pho, you gotta do it right). It came with a huge heaping of bean sprouts (yum), fresh basil (lookin' good), and a few wedges of lime (aw yeah). Then, the pho came. Quite honestly, the pho looked a bit sad. I was looking for those thin slices of rawish beef still cooking in the broth but it just looks like the beef slices found in the supermarket and not what should be found in the pho. However, the flavors were still there. Oh man, the unami flavor of the broth was really there and that's basically what you want when you eat pho.   Would I come back here? Probably. Would it be my to-go place when I'm in town? Nah. While I will continue to go, I don't plan on going out of my way to eat here.",

If you don't live near this place and want Pho to go you can place a take out order like I did. When I arrived my pho was separated, the noodles and veggies in a flat container, and the flavorful broth was in a large container. It can simply be mixed at home and served. I normally put the broth in a pot to get it nicely hot. Then add the noodles and the veggies to the broth. Let it simmer for a few minutes and put it in a nice deep bowl. It was enough for two people and some left over. So perfect for cold winter night or when I am feeling under the weather!!  The staff is friendly and professional.  Never been dissatisfied with Viet Thai Noodle House ... Delicious!!",

    "text": "The only way you will be satisfied after leaving this place is to go in and expect the worst treatment from the waitstaff. Prices are high compared to other pho places, so we don't come here too often. Pho is incredibly delicious, which is why I always come back after previously leaving, emotionally abused. They mainly have just two waitress and they are taking care of the tables and the front desk for customers who do take out. Because of their location in Charlotte, they have a very diverse crowd. I think that as long as you're not Asian, you will be respected and cared for, so don't be scared to try Vietnamese/Thai for the first time.   Today, I ordered a pho dish that didn't include beef meat balls. I requested to have some added for additional cost. Waitress rolled her eyes at me (picture Liz Lemon's masterpiece eye roll). Our order wasn't complicated. We both ordered tea to drink and then two pho dish and one to have meat balls added. Eye roll was unnecessary for such a common request from pho eaters. Their pho is some of the best pho I've had, and that keeps me coming back. The broth isn't over powered by sweetness and cinnamon, which is how I prefer it. Their serving looks small but I am always full and satisfied at the end. My boyfriend always gets the seafood pho (pho do bien) and I always want to try some of his broth. It's so clean and light. Their summer rolls are very sad. It had noodles, the herbs, and ONE shrimp, cut in half. The peanut sauce that comes with the summer roll is so unique and flavorful. It's the only thing that adds flavor to their summer rolls. I would prefer not to order it but my boyfriend will take summer rolls anywhere he can get them.   Their service is a hit or miss (expect miss), but their food is enough to recommend to you.",

I really wanted to love this place, but I thought it was just Okay. The service was wonderful, really nice, friendly and fast. The food on the other hand I thought was not very fresh and left a lot to be desired. We started with the spring rolls, those were good. Col got the yellow curry and it was really spicy- that is to be expected. I got the pad see ew. I didn't like this at all. It didn't taste good and it was really lacking veggies. Our meals were around 13.00 dollars, not horrible, but I was expecting a lot better.  Between  Jade and Basil within a 10 mile radius, I don't think I'll be visiting again.

Thai and Vietnamese rank among the top cuisines we absolutely love and hence we seek it out in every city we have ever visited. So when we had to go to Charlotte, NC for work and decided to stop by this place for dinner, we were not expecting authentic food. I would have settled for passable, this is Charlotte, not Los Angeles or New York or DC.   When we walked in the door we saw that the place was packed at 6 PM on a Thursday night. Now this was a great sign. And there were many Vietnamese families among the guests, now this is an excellent sign! We ordered Bun tom thit ga nuong (chicken and shrimp with vermicelli) and pad ke mow (shrimp drunken noodles). Oh my goodness, from the first bite to the last, what an explosion of taste! I would rate the food here among the best Vietnamese and Thai I have ever eaten! And for the fraction of the price I have paid in the past.  We finished with the mango sticky rice, once more phenomenal! The customer service is attentive and friendly, with an exception of a lady who brought our check at the very end, who was not the most friendly out there but its okay. The two gentlemen ( an older guy who could only be the owner and a younger guy probably the owner's son), were attentive and helpful through-out.  I would have happily given them 5 stars but refrained because of the interior decoration. The decor was dated and in a very run down tattered state. They've got to invest in making this place look decent. Right now it looks like a place that belongs in the back alley somewhere, does nothing for ambiance or the customer's experience.  But if all you needed was exceptional food (sans ambiance), you've found the right place. Charlotte.. you've impressed me! Who would have guessed you could hide such authenticity within you!",

I loved the plate of bean sprouts and fresh Thai basil that is served with the soup.   I recently discovered that this place has the best Larb and sticky rice than all of the Thai restaurants that I normally go to (I am Thai BTW). Tom Kah Gai here is spicier than at Thai House and Thai Taste and contained fresh Kah and Lemon Grass with more coconut milk in the broth. Som Tum(Papaya Salad) that is made here is the closest to Som Tum made in northern Thailand. I ordered 4 stars one time and had sweats running down my neck half way through eating it.  For those who like to see famous faces, this is also a favorite restaurant for Ben Bernanke when he visits his family in Charlotte.",

I usually have the vegetarian pho, just because I love how the tofu tastes after absorbing all the broth, mmmm! Even their thai iced tea is great. Since my boyfriend loves Thai food and I'm crazy about pho, this is a good place to please both our cravings. The last time we went there we ordered the summer rolls as appetizers which were just like they are everywhere else. My boyfriend had the red curry with a spice level of 4. It was wayyy spicier than he expected but he enjoyed it nevertheless. It was delicious. The next time he tried something called Pad Kratiem Prik Thai (okay I had to Google that since they don't have a menu online and the name is so uncommon), which is chicken with garlic and white pepper. It was mind blowing! This makes me realize something, since I always get the veggie pho, I hardly know about any of the other dishes here but whatever I have tried from my companion's order, I have consistently loved. I don't think there is anything here that I haven't liked and even thinking about it all is making my mouth water right now. Even the owners and servers are very friendly and the service is very prompt. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for some flavorful Vietnamese or Thai food.",

As soon as you walk in the door you are greeted by great staff.  It appears it is a family owned business which I always appreciate.   Here you will find some of the best and largest summer/basil rolls. The peanut sauce completes it and is on point.  Pro-tip- get an extra order so you will have them for lunch the next day. Then as you open this rather large menu you will have lots of choices to chose from. Hint- you can't go wrong but I typically go with one of the Pho options.  Sometimes I get the House Special and top it off with the fish sauce. The fish sauce is a must and so good. So back to the Pho, its my favorite Pho Dac Beit which includes the rare beef, well-done beef, meatballs, tendon, cilantro, and love to add sprouts, sirachi, and hoison.  It is in this broth that is to die for. I have even got the pho to go before and they provide a \"kit\" so you can put it all together when you get home.  Last but definitely not least you should make sure to get the sweet tea. Even if you don't like sweet tea order this version as this is a \"thai version\". i wish i knew the recipe. Whatever the mix of chinese herbs are you cant beat this tea. I have several glasses while enjoying my meal and they even make me a to go cup.  On this brisk day I am craving some pho and sweet tea so I know where I will be going!",

Great option for summer because although its a ton of food it has a light taste.

While the food was good, the service was so rude and disrespectful, I am stunned. The restaurant was very busy, got it.  We were \"greeted\" by one of the servers, pointing to an empty table in one direction but she was walking in a completely opposite direction..so I wasn't sure if we should follow her or take the empty table she pointed to behind us. Ok, sat at the empty table after she scolded us for following her.   As soon as we put our butts on the seats, a wait person approached wanting to know our drink and meal order. We asked for a minute and she proclaimed she was too busy and walked away.     She returned a few minutes later and asked what we wanted. We ordered drinks. She asks what we wanted to eat. Again requested that we needed a few minutes. She was not happy.    She comes back with the drinks, puts them \"loudly\" on the table. Asked my husband if he was ready. Thank heavens he had an answer. She asked me what I wanted and I hesitated. Man was she pissed. We almost walked out. We should have.   I won't continue because there isn't anything good to say. We won't go back.",

Apparently different regions of Thailand prepare it different ways, and VT makes it the way I was initially introduced to the dish, without the bright red color to it.

He didn't like their spring rolls either, which were filled with mostly vegetables and very little meat. The service was as bad as the food. We didn't get any napkins until we were finally able to flag a waitress down at the end of our meal. (I have kids. You NEED napkins. Lots of them.) The waitress also poured water into a cup of Sprite, and she apologized but didn't offer a new drink. Needless to say, we won't be coming again.",

    "text": "Stopped in here for lunch because I was feeling a bit under the weather and wanted to try their vegetarian/tofu pho but ended up ordering the Pad see ew.  My daughters were with me and they both got the pho so I figured I'd try theirs. The waitress was very nice though a bit persistent in trying to get our orders while we barely had time to look at the menu but she wasn't rude at all.  I told her that I wanted level Thai spicy and as usual, I get the, 'are you sure?' look.  This happens no matter where I go, it's like they just can't believe it can be handled by an American. But then again maybe they've had one too many dishes sent back because the patron truly bit off more than they could chew.  Well my order came out and it looked spicy and tasted delicious but it wasn't Thai level 5 spicy.  I added some of the chili oil she brought out as back up and it added a little more heat to it.  One negative was that there were far too many vegetables in the dish, they overpowered the noodles.  The same with the vegetarian pho.  The mushrooms weren't sliced and broccoli weren't bite sized and it just was overloaded with veggies but the broth was soooo delicious.  We saved it and I strained it and heated it up in a mug the next morning and drank it. So delicious.  So I only had a taste of two things on the menu but the taste and service deserves a 4 but the overwhelming veggie to noodle ratio and the lunch time prices(a bit much) are why I took off a star.  I'll update if anything changes.  That is all!  (Don't forget to hit the useful, funny or cool button.  Would love the feedback.)",

Everything from curry to pad thai to pho and etc. They have milk tea aswell. Lots of atmosphere. The staff was very helpful and she helped me pick a menu item that read my mind and was exactly what i was looking for and hit the spot oh so well. Definitely reccomend this place as the food was hot and tasted amazing, I got it spicy and it was served with a side of hot oil and chili oil. So much flavor i cannot wait to go back. I definitely want to try the pho or the soup next time because another guest walked in and didnt even need a menu and he got a massive lunch soup with tons of fresh ingredients and it smelled fantastic. I got the rare beef pho to go for a buddy and it was excellent. Came with some rare beef and some excellent hot minty broth and tons of beans sprouts.  I'll be coming back next week for sure.",

    "text": "My friend and I went to Viet-Thai for lunch on a Friday afternoon. We were seating right away at a table up front. The service was very quick. We ordered summer rolls with tofu to start, which were fresh and delicious. I loved the peanut sauce that went with it. After eating our summer rolls, my friend's daughter started to freak out because there was a roach on the wall by our table. It took us awhile before we got someone's attention, and when the guy saw it he just squashed it with his bare hand, which freaked out her daughter. He said they sprayed for bugs outside, so they make their way inside. Um, ew.   I ordered pad thai with chicken spicy level 3. It was definitely spicy and tasty, but I was not impressed. It did not have much dimension to it. The lunch order was huge, though, and it gave me plenty to take home.   Overall, it was not bad. I wouldn't mind going back, but I won't go out of my way.",

We ordered pad kee mao at spice level 3 for $12.75 and a thai iced tea for $3.50. Our total came out to 17 bucks, reasonable prices for dinner..and looks like all menu items are around 8-9 bucks for lunch. Our food came in one of those half styrofoam containers and the drink was pretty big. The container was packed to the brim with delicious drunken noodles, great flavor and spice. You'd probably get more food if you dine in. They also put in more noodles than veggies/chicken, which I like. You can also get extra noodles for $2 add on, worth it if you are sharing. We didn't opt for it since I wasn't that hungry.   All in all, very good and will be back. Cheers!",

    "text": "Three and 1/2 stars - still better than Deejay Thai in my book.  I personally don't care for hybrid restaurants but at least Vietnam and Thailand are neighbors and totally unlike Japan's, their cuisine share similarities   Based on taste alone I would have easily rated it 4 stars but ... first impression is not so great. The place is dark and dingy, you're greeted by two banquettes with ripped seats by the door plus the Thai menu is extremely limited - only one page long.  I wanted to try a duck dish -as always- but they don't serve any. M'kay, so we ordered a shrimp Tum Yum, a Pad Thai and a Shrimp and Eggplant stir fry and asked for everything to be spiced Medium hot.    We were served a good size bowl of Tum Yum with the usual tomato chunks, mushrooms and shrimps but much more important also galanga, lemongrass, lime leaves, chili etc. Now THAT's how Tum Yum is made - caveat: it was a little heavy handed with lemongrass which could make it too strong for some. I've had better, but not much better and not in Charlotte.  The Pad Thai was excellent, no other way to describe it. Lighter than the one we enjoyed at Thai orchid a few days earlier, but better for it. The Japanese eggplant  was served with shrimp, onions and green and red peppers in a sweet chili sauce that left us with a sweet after taste. It was obviously stir fried to order and the eggplant was simply delicious, but for some reason I wished the red peppers had been cooked a little longer. The final result didn't make me think of \"a dish\" as much as of different ingredients sharing the same plate.   Service was as expected, no complaints. We were charged dinner prices , $8 for the soup, about $13 for a dish because this was on a Sunday, which was fine because they made it up in quantity : we couldn't finish it all.   To sum it up great food, wish it was closer. I think the limited menu and sad decor won't warrant what is a 20 mile round trip for us ... not unless we're badly craving for Tum Yum.",

Although I love cilantro, I was really hoping that this pho would taste llike more than just cilantro broth. I added some lime and chili sauce to the broth which helped a little but it was not as good as the phos I've had at other places. I also tried the papaya salad based on the reviews I had seen. It was very interesting and I've never tasted anything like it. The peanuts and shrimp with the papaya were an interesting combination that I think I can do without. I most likely will not be back.",

Both had excellent  flavor. The kids ordered Hawaiian fried Rice (cashews, raisins & pineapple) VERY flavorful as well. Kids also got bubble tea and we got Thai Iced Tea. Impressed with the size of the Thai teas.  Overall I will give 4 stars to any restaurant that has a bottle of Sriracha (liquid crack) on the table, but this place deserves it also for their authentic, fresh and flavorful food. The only gripe is that it was a little pricey(no kids menu?) but then again its tough to find authentic Pho in the South. We'll be coming back-",

Started with spring roll, super hot and a tad bit greasy, friend had the wonton soup (I don't eat seafood) and they LOVED it, said unlike any they had before... it had a lot going on, won tons, shrimp, looked very hearty. We both ordered off the Thai menu, she had chicken, veggies  in a garlic sauce... the sauce was nice and light, broth like and full of flavor. I ordered chicken, veggies, in a brown sauce level 3 spicy wide pan noodles. All the food came out hot and the veggies were very fresh and not overcooked. Apps came out quickly, it took a while for entrees to come out, they were not very busy so I assume from everything being made fresh. I would love to go back and try some of the Vietnamese dishes.",

Well, I now have these annoying restaurants to thank for finding this little gem. My companions had two different types of pad Thai and I had the vegetarian tofu pho. All so good! :-) We shall return!",

So conclusion need to find a new Vietnamese place.",

The bun bo hue did not have blood cubes which is what would be expected and the base of the soup seemed similar to tom yum soup.  I can't quite figure out how the pho tastes different than the pho I expect.  It is different and again it tastes good, but not great and different.  Will try the Thai food next time.  If you expecting traditional pho and bun bo hue this is not the place, but if you are ok with good food that is coherent out I'd worth a try.",

For appetizers, try Tom Kha Gai (#9) or Yum Woon Sen (#16).  The Pho Do Bien (#51) is a no brainier.  Totally addictive.  They have a dish nicknamed \"drunken noodle\" that is off the hook good.  Don't remember the number though.  The curry dishes are awesome.  Try them as-is.  This is an authentic Vietnamese restaurant so they turn up the heat.",

Fave foods here include:  Papaya Salad - ask for it without shrimp cause the shrimp alters the True flavor of the papaya sauce. Perfect balance of sweet, sour, salty and spiciness. It's a pretty hefty price tag of $15 but well worth it. So suck it up and order it.   Nam Tok - it's a beef salad. Sliced grilled beef with a sweet and sour sauce including ground toasted rice for that extra umami flavor.   Lard na - stir fried wide rice noodles in a sweet gravy with veggies. This is similar to Pad se ewe except it has a gravy.   Pretty much all the dishes are delicious but those three are my go-to anytime I visit this place. Try it out!",

We generally come for weekday lunches.  It seems there are several regular visitors as the staff knew some customers by name.  That is a great sign.    The menu is extensive and the various portion options make it easy to find the right fit for your appetite.  I loved the chicken curry (#4 spicy) which had amazing flavor, a nice heat (just a bit of forehead sweat), and fantastic texture.  The potato's and carrots were cooked perfectly.  The chicken was delicious.  This curry was amazing!  My wife has tried a few dishes and really enjoyed the pho, but everything was really good.  Like I said, we tried it on a whim and could not wait to go back.  The price was very good and this was a perfect meal for what we wanted.",

The space is pretty huge; there are plenty of tables for large groups.  We ordered a papaya salad to start. The salad was a bit different from what we are used to. It had a wedge of cabbage on the side which just seemed a bit of a waste and no peanuts which we really missed. Ive even had the salad with cashews before. Any nut would have been nice. The salad came with small fried shrimp on top.  That is also not something I was used to but they were surprisingly good.   We ordered the red curry and the yellow curry.  They curries tasted more like Indian curries than Thai curries to me but were pretty good. The portions were also very large.  So, you will not leave hungry but you will probably leave with leftovers. Recommendation: When you order Thai spicy,  it is really spicy so be prepared to handle it. I handle spicy pretty we but after 2 highly spicy dishes in a row,  my taste buds started to go numb.  That was my fault though... Need to know your limits.   Would return for the curry and would. Be interested in trying the pho/other Vietnamese dishes.   Service was decent. Prices were as would be expected in Charlotte.  Check out the pic!",

My orders are always really basic and the food is always delicious. From the chicken satay to the pad Thai or the pho, you can't go wrong really. If a casual & comfortable dining experience is what you're looking for, this is the place to check out. If some soul satisfying Thai or Vietnamese food is what you're looking for, come here.

I'm not sure if it just downgraded over time or my palette has improved over the years, but this place isn't as good as I remembered at all.   The Thai food is pretty good which I would recommend over the Vietnamese food here. They know how to cook Thai better. I recommend the red curry and Panang curry though I've had better Thai curries at other Thai restaurants in the Queen City.   Don't get the Vietnamese food here. The pho is decent, but the bun bo hue was not good. The meat was way too thick that I just ended up eating the noodles only and sipping the broth. And the bun thit ga had the same problem. The meat was also too thick and chewy.  One thing I really liked is their sweet tea which isn't the sweet tea you're used to at typical restaurants. It's Thai sweet tea and it tasted much better than the traditional sweet tea.   Service is also bad. There was this one waitress that was extremely rude and had a punchable face. We were wondering how she got the waitress job until we found out that it's a family business and she's part of the family. No wonder. The wife of my dad's friend was the only friendly person and gave us good service.",

    "text": "YUM!  Viet-Thai Noodle House is a little hard to find if you are using your phone GPS. It brings you to the front of the structure, not their storefront. So, basically, park and walk, or explore on your own. It's directly behind Burlington Coat Factory.   We had a party of 6 and it was easy to get a table. No waiting necessary. This is a no-frills restaurant. If you're expecting decore, cute setting and romantic feel, this is not the place for you. They're all about the food.  Like I said, we had a party of 6, so I am pretty sure gratuity was included, but because I paid in cash, I was not given my receipt back. I think I left a double tip, which is why I am not giving 5 stars.   I ordered the Veg Pho. Awesome choice. Loaded with veggies and tofu. Wonderful flavor and a HUGE portion. I brought home leftovers.  The waitress was super accommodating and I requested no mushrooms in my vegetarian pho, and they made sure to put extra carrots in my order. Beyond the Veg Pho, there weren't too many options for veggies out there, but the pho is worth it, so give it a try.",

This go around we had the Com Tom Thit Ga Nuog (grill chicken & shrimp), Pad Kee Mow noodles w/beef, Garbo Darby (red curry w/chicken) and Thi Fried Rice w/ chicken. All of the aforementioned dishes were as favorable as they were enjoyable however, if you really like \"heat\" I suggest that you share that bit of info in advance of placing your order. You will find VTNH is a great spot to bring the family (the little ones, the teens and adults) and everyone will leave feeling content and with smile on their respective faces.",

It's on the backside of the shopping center - a little bit tucked away.  I had the Pho Chicken soup with the noodles.  This dish is hard to mess up and they didn't.  My friend had beef served with rice.   He enjoyed it, but didn't seem to rave about it.  The service was almost too good.  They kept wanting to take our order and then cash out our tab.  They were being efficient, but didn't realize we were there to catch up with each other.  Their health grade was a 93.5, which was okay, but not as good as I like to see.  I am glad this restaurant is here.  It is clearly not a place that I come to often.  It doesn't make me jump up and down or squeal with every bite, but it's solid.",

WRONG. They gave me Dried out chicken satay and shrimp sticks. I'm about 75% sure they were day old and reheated. The tofu was fresh and the egg roll was fresh, but the peanut sauce was watery and had an off flavor. Lastly, my husband's red curry was oily and watered down. I've never seen such a thin curry that didn't even coat the spoon or sides of the container. Shameful.",

What I expect out of a Vietnamese restaurant is fresh, crisp summer rolls, pho with fresh veggies and meats, plenty of noodles, and flavorful broth, and delicious vermicelli dishes. Viet-Thai Noodle House delivers on all of these! My boyfriend and I agree that their pho contains the most noodles and tastiest broth in all of Charlotte. I especially love their vegetarian pho: delicious veggies and perfectly cooked tofu. It can be rather difficult to find from the main road, but it is certainly worth it to make the trip! And even when they're busy, we've never had to wait long for a table. This place tops the list! I have yet to try any of their Thai items - the Vietnamese food is what I go for!",

It's open every day of the week but Monday!   One of the best things about this place is the people who run it.  They are very friendly and offer great recommendations if you are interested in being adventurous when browsing the extensive menu.  The folks here are also very flexible and can customize the dishes to suite your taste.  They take great pride in their food and it shows!  I've ordered both Vietnamese and Thai dishes here and have always been really happy with what I picked.  Everything is fresh and full of flavor.  Some of the dishes are enormous and you will have plenty left over to take home, but there are also lighter options.  The menu, again, is extensive so if you can't find something that looks appealing then I don't know what else to tell you! I've been told that the food is as close to authentic as you will find in Charlotte.  Given the outstanding service, great food, and reasonable prices, this place tops my list of Thai restaurants.",

Ordered Veggie/Tofu Pho and loved it. Be sure to ask for some Chili sauce to further enhance the overall flavor. TRUST ME!   RECOMMENDATION: Try the Thai Iced Tea. Excellent!

They were so busy, which we understand, but the waitress said maybe 2 words to us, never came to check on us, took 10 minutes to even get water, AND didn't tell us that she was not even bringing our check to the table so made us wait 15 minutes before we sought her out. When we were here last our service was great but this was a huge disappointment.. The food was still good so I gave 3 instead of 2 stars.",

Other restaurants obviously been used powder and hurted my throat; and their meals are for good looking, so little, i was never full. The price here is little higher than other places but the meal they brought out is enough to make you full. I can actually call it a human's meal. Because other restaurants brought out so little. I hated it when they close at 3-5pm. But definitely will come back! Good services, good foods, good looking. Love it!",

I am always looking to one up the spring roll and soup challenge and sure enough both the soup and rolls had my mouth watering for more. I could not get enough of the peanut dipping sauce and the large slices of ginger in their shrimp tom yum soup. The shrimp spring rolls were awesome with the fresh taste of basil, lemongrass and of course shrimp (none of the sketchy sorts either) . The rolls were large for an appetizer s a plus if you want to share a minus if you don't. I decided to be stingy and keep both for myself. Onto the amazing soup again good portion size at this point I was getting stuffed but I forged on in my quest to finish the entire bowl. Can we say fresh shrimp, large mushrooms, tomatoes, ginger, lemongrass and that drink it from the bowl sweet and sour broth? As always service was prompt and attentive but hey I could get 3/4 of the way through my water glass before it was refilled. Bonus. I cannot say good enough things about this place. I wish I had room for the Vietnamese coffee but that may have sent me over the edge.",

After going to the wrong shopping center I finally found it and I was not disappointed. The atmosphere was very cozy. I ordered yellow curry with tofu and Thai boba (known here as bubble tea). The hostess was very nice and greeted me as I walked in and promptly offered me a menu. I had looked at the menu online but had some questions and she patiently answered all of them. In less than 10 minutes I was in and out with my order. I took a sip of the boba and was in heaven! The tea was fresh and had the perfect amount of spices. The curry was delicious! She warned me it would be spicy and boy was she right, but that's why I got the tea. Will defiantly be going back to try the other flavors of boba as well as other menu items. A must try if you love Thai and Vietnamese food!",

    "text": "I had lunch at the Viet-Thai Noodle house late on a Sunday afternoon, about 2pm.  The atmosphere is very nice, typical Asian decor, clean and well maintained.  The place was pretty empty, there was only one other party there when I came in.  I ordered the summer rolls, goi cuon, & pho tai, rare beef with green onions and cilantro.  The pho comes in 3 sizes medium, large, and XL.  I ordered the XL, being an XL guy.  The summer rolls came out very quickly.  The rice paper wrapper was sticky and chewy, nice compliment to crunch of the fresh vegetables inside.  The peanut sauce was excellent.  The rolls were enormous and reasonably priced, $3.75 for an order of two.  I don't know if the staff waited til I finished my summer rolls or it was just a coincidence, but my server brought the pho tai out a couple of minutes after I finished them.  I dumped the bean sprouts and jalapenos right into the steaming hot soup then added some basil leaves and lime juice.  The broth was steaming hot and had a nice rich flavor.  I didn't have them spice the soup up, so I added a generous shot of srichacha sauce to give it some kick.  I have tried eating the noodled with chop sticks and usually windup wearing more than I eat, so I stuck with a fork.  The beef was tender and delicious.  With the restaurant being pretty empty the service was excellent, very friendly and making sure I had everything I needed.  I got the feeling though if the place was busier that the service would still be excellent.  The prices are very reasonable, being about the same as most places I have visited while I have been here in Charlotte (the XL Pho Tai was $9.50).   I will definitely come back here to try the Pad Thai and other items.",

When you walk inside it's pretty dark, all of the windows are covered with white curtains which I think is nice so you aren't looking at a bunch of cars in the parking lot while you're eating.  The menu is pretty big and they serve Vietnamese, Thai and, if you ask them for it, they also have a limited menu of Lao food (the owners are actually from Laos).  Since these 3 countries are all so close to each other in Southeast Asia their cuisines share some similarities and they use similar ingredients.  I've only tried their Vietnamese food, so far, and it is very good.  I tried a couple different rice dishes which were prepared well with really fresh vegetables.  Their pho is also prepared well and comes out very quick!  Another thing they have is bubble tea with all different kinds of flavors, green tea is my favorite, a nice treat to end a good meal with!",

    "text": "It is a nice restaurant with ample parking in a safe location. They have both Vietnamese and Thai dishes on their menu. I'd say that they are trying to be creative in their dishes. Maybe I was in the mood for a more traditional dish, but I didn't really care for their deconstructed Panang curry (see picture). And it's the first time I've had Panang curry with peas and steamed broccoli. Certainly more healthy, but not what if call traditional. I asked for it to be Thai hot. It was more like cautious American-Thai hot. So, overall it's decent food, but just not doing it for me as a traditionalist.",

So a group of eight, turned around to leave, my mom tells the man, \"we come back when you have alcohol.\"  I thought good lord, let me get this woman out of here!  I decided to give it a try yesterday, it looked totally different from my first visit. The two people were working were pleasant and efficient.  I ordered fresh rolls and vermicelli with pork.  There is something very addictive in Vietnamese food, maybe it's the cilantro and mint or the fish sauce, but you can bet, I want to eat there again today.  And yes, mama, they do have alcohol, it's safe to return.",

    "text": "Viet Thai is located on the side of the mall closest to Lowes. It's a dimly lit restaurant that honestly looks really shady, but its in a strip mall with a parking lot. When I walked in, it was also pretty quiet and there was plenty of tables and booths open.  Surprisingly, this is probably as good as it gets in Charlotte for both Vietnamese and Thai food! Who woulda guessed, right? I had my doubts, as a place claiming to serve both Vietnamese and Thai food which are extremely different types of food. I think the owners are Vietnamese, but contrary to most others, they are extremely nice. When they added peanuts to the Pad Thai I ordered with NO PEANUTS, they remade it without any complaints.  Spring Rolls - Would get again. They are HUGE!  The Pad Thai is DELISH and comes in hearty portions. The noodles and the flavor and sauce are all right on point. Perfectly cooked every single time! Note: if you like spicy, ask for it extra spicy because \"mild\" is so mild that you can't taste the spice.  The Pho Ga (Chicken) is also really good and has a tasty broth. The large/small didn't seem much different in size (stick with the small).  The Pad See Ew - I've had better noodles, I like them more delicate.  Pad Kee Mao - The mild was SO spicy! They use the same noodles as the Pad See Ew, and Lard Na. It was alright but I think one order isn't enough to fill me up. Needs more noodles.  Bun Bo Hue - Spicy Beef Noodle Soup. I liked that they were really generous with the meat. But like the Pad See Ew, there weren't enough noodles. The noodles were really interesting, most people use pho noodles, but these were white round rice noodles, kinda chewy and bouncy. Would return for this when I'm craving beef.  Black Milk Tea with Boba - SKIP! Tastes like soap, probably because they use jasmine tea or something. The bubble drinks here are made with powder, so I would not recommend the fruit ones.  Vietnamese Iced Coffee - SO GOOD. and they give you alot too!",

I had the XL size and it was just the right amount of food for me. Maybe a little too much, but better safe than sorry. The beef and tendons were wonderful.  If you like your food spicy, ask for the spicy chili oil. It's delicious. Only takes a few drops in your soup to get it really kickin.  Sadly, they ran out of bubbles at the time of night we were there. Ultimate sadness. So we had to share one bubble tea. We had the melon slushi and it wasn't bad. The bubbles were a just little bland compared to what I'm used to and a little hard. But overall the tea was good. I'd get it again.  Service was really good and always is. Our waiter was attentive and very nice.",

    "text": "So excited to try another great Thai restaurant in town! Doing our normal Saturday routine and scouring Yelp for lunch options. Very happy to find Viet-Thai at the top of our nearby options!  This little place is tucked discretely in the McMullen Creek Shopping Center. If you are entering from Johnston, it's caddy corner from Lowe's and near Curves. Better to enter from Johnston than 51. You'll see it much better upon entering.   The menu is ENORMOUS. Much like other Thai/vietnamese restaurants in town there are so many options. We started out with bubble tea! So happy that there is a place to grab bubble tea in south Charlotte. We tried mango and taro. Both delicious and refreshing. $0.50 extra for tapioca pearls. Kind of a bummer but not enough to stop us!  The summer rolls are perfect. Got both tofu and shrimp. Packed full of vermicelli, cilantro, carrots and lettuce. The peanut sauce accompaniment is very welcoming. I recommend adding a little sriracha to the mix. Your taste buds will thank you later. Freshness beyond comparison.   My wife got vegetarian pad Thai. Sweet, smoky and well-balanced. A rather generous portion, to boot. Choc a bloc filled with bamboo shoots. This dish would be perfect with an added protein is just fine sans.   I tried the #83 (the name escapes me) with medium spicy sauce. You can ask for Thai spicy, but beware Viet-Thai lovers. It's a force to be reckoned with. My entree was filled with sweet sauteed green and red peppers, onions and wide cut rice noodles. Matched with chicken and a sweet soy base. Compounding spice factor throughout my enjoyment and, boy, was it intense! I couldn't imagine any spicier. They serve your entree with ornate chopsticks, as well. Perfect for you noodle-goers. Loved every bite and intermittently sipped bubble tea and water to ward off the capsaicin onslaught!  Viet-Thai is absolutely wonderful. The staff is friendly and rather helpful with the menu.   Prices are very fair for lunch. We ended up with a $38 bill after all of the above. Could be much cheaper, too! No complaints.   If you like Thai, Vietnamese or Mao cuisine, this should be bookmarked for you to try asap!  Solid 4.5 of 5!",

But compared to other Vietnamese restaurants I guess the prices are comparable to others but being that I am from the west coast where the prices are below $10. I am reluctant to give this place above 2 stars. Although the flavor is very spot on to the actual flavors in Vietnam. Just the prices is keeping me from scoring no more than 2 stars. If the prices were below $10 definitely this place will receive at least 4 stars.",

I then had the Pho Tai (with rare beef, white onions and cilantro).  The pho broth is good, and the beef is tender.  They could probably get away with half as much bean sprouts per order, but I appreciate the generous serving.  Even though we were stuffed (how do you somehow get stuffed from soup and salad in rice paper?...), we couldn't resist \"bubble tea\" to go.  We tried the taro bubble tea with big tapioca in the bottom.  Oh, man - what an interesting treat!  I will order it again next time I go, which will most likely be next week!",

The interior decor is beautiful (a huge fish tank in the back with goldfish - always a plus). My food was delicious - green curry tofu with green bell peppers and bamboo shoots over rice. I got the Thai iced tea which was gone in under two minutes, was THAT good. Also there's a bar which was showing the game from the TV which was cool.

    "text": "Ok, so I've been on a nationwide search for my new favorite kind of food, Thai.  Since all the cool Yelpers have been to Viet Thai sweetie and I went for dinner tonight.  I was a bit ahead of the game and found it right away thanks to everyone else's directions and drove in from Johnston Rd.  Pretty non descript place and from the other diners I could tell the food was authentic from the moment I walked in.  Started out with the Ginger Tea which was so tasty, I wish I could make it like that at home.  Hot and steamy with such a fresh ginger flavor it really opened up my tastebuds for what was to come.  We started off with the summer rolls, steamed shrimp, lettuce, cucumber, fresh cilantro, carrots and vermicelli noodles wrapped tightly in rice paper and served with peanut sauce.  Compared to other similar rolls they were very generous with the shrimp and the cilantro tasted like it was right off the stem....delicious!  I am working on becoming more adventurous with my thai selections and I vowed not to order my standard Pad Thai, so I went with the # 93 Pad Kratiem Prick Thai (Pretty authentic sounding huh?).  Marinated chicken stir fried with garlic, and Thai white pepper, cilantro and scallions served with broccoli.  The key to this dish was the fresh ingredients, especially the strong ones.  The cilantro and garlic were so darn flavorful and added so much depth to the meal.  Thai White Pepper, whatever that is also was able to be distinctively tasted throughout and was a nice addition.  Since I am a True pansy on the \"spice\" meter I ordered it \"Mid\" which was not spicy at all.  Sweetie ordered her meal at \"Medium\" which is one step above \"mid\" and let's just say she won't get any smooches tonight since I don't want the spiciness to transfer to me.  She was lit up the entire meal.  Service was a bit lacking IMO, once they dropped off the meal we didn't have anyone stop by or check on us until it was time for the check.  Great experience, great flavor and value.  For everything we were out $33.00 without tip.  We'll be back.",

A girlfriend if mine recommended i try Pho when I had a sore throat due to sinuses. So I've tried many versions. I've gotten to the point where I only order the broth because I can't stand the chewiness of the beef. But i have found that it does work on my throat! Lo and behold they offered a chicken option here, which I later saw was the most expensive one, I figured I'd give it a try.  So glad I did! The broth was so flavorful I added a bit of the accompanying sauces and I'm not sure if they added to the spiciness but it was spot On! Hands down the best I've had so far. Will update on the throat situation...",

Also, their appetizers are on point with the summer rolls being a highlight. They are generic and typical, but done right and don't fall apart.

    "text": "Viet-Thai... Oh Viet-Thai. First of all, let me explain my 4 Stars. Viet-Thai is a 5-star joint when you compare it to all other Asian restaurants in Charlotte. However, when you compare Viet-Thai to restaurants in other cities (Honolulu, LA, Atlanta/Duluth, etc.), it may fall a little short.   LOCATION South Charlotte-ish  AMBIENCE Comfortable, family-style restaurant. Comfy booths, tables.. I've never felt uncomfortable wearing shorts and a t-shirt here. If you're looking for an upscale meal for an uppity date, this is definitely not the place for you. if you've been dating a girl/guy for 2+ years and you're comfortable eating a ton of good food and maybe leaving a little pudgier than when you first walked in, this is the place for you! The waitresses are more than accommodating. If you go there often enough (like I do), mama-san starts to recognize you and brings you extra food items even before you ask (such as pho soup on the side or extra peanut sauce).   Despite the non-uppity nature of this restaurant, be forewarned that the prices are a bit steep.  FOOD I like Asian food. I think that Charlotte is really lacking in this arena. SERIOUSLY LACKING. I also think that Charlotte folks don't really know Asian food.. but that's really besides the point. (but seriously, come on. Cowfish is not a great restaurant. why do you guys keep going there for sushi???)   Anyway, what is important is that I am a return customer at Viet-Thai. That says a lot for this little place in Charlotte. Viet-Thai is a funky, fusion-ish restaurant. My theory is that the owners are a husband-wife combo who decided to merge their ethnic backgrounds to create this restaurant. (Let me be clear peeps... Restaurants that have \"multi-Asian\" cuisine should be thought of as wonky.)  Viet-Thai is the place we go to when we need our pho or pad thai fix for the week. It's pretty darn convenient that I can order both pho and pad thai at once. Again, come here with someone you're comfortable chowing down with.   Summer Rolls (not fried) Their *huge* summer rolls are delicious but definitely not what you'd expect from a Vietnamese joint. They use a little bit of cabbage and some other greens that typically don't get rolled into the summer roll. Their peanut sauce is also a little different than other places. It's pretty runny and heavy on the peanut butter rather than hoisin.   Pho Their pho has always been on point. It isn't greasy and definitely doesn't lack in flavor. Their broth has a significant amount of cilantro flavoring though-- so for those of you who don't appreciate herbal deliciousness, you may want to stay away from pho.   Mi  Mi... I was recently introduced to this dish by my Vietnamese friend, Tommy in an authentic Vietnamese restaurant on Buford Highway. You know that's legit.The mi is pretty delicious. The broth is definitely lighter (in taste and in color) than pho and the seafood flavor is pretty amazing. It has a sweet after taste that's really pleasing.......... But, it's salty. Seriously salty.   Pad Thai  Their pad thai is great... most of the time. I think that the cook changes depending on the day of the week. On Sundays, the pad thai is ALWAYS ON POINT. Just a little piece of advice. :) The chicken is always tender and there is always tofu in the pad thai no matter what protein you order it with. Note: this is the extreme tamarind type of pad thai.   Bun Bun here is wonderful. I've had shrimp, chicken, pork, beef.. all of the above, you know. Bun at viet-thai is a semi-cold noodle dish that is typically served with greens and a hefty serving of protein. The fish sauce is on point and you really can't go wrong with ordering this dish. If you're in the mood for something a little lighter but still slightly warm and delicious, this is the dish for you.",

The meat for the pho were too thick and hard to chew. It was cut in the manner that didn't not look too pleasing in the Ph bowl. I ordered a rice plate with shrimp and vegetables. There were 4 shrimps and the vegetables consisted of all bell peppers. The dish overall was also incredibly salty. I could barely taste the sauce. Our drinks did not get refilled. I had water and my husband sweet tea. The place was almost empty yet no refills. We won't be going back again.",

The menu is very extensive, they have both Thai and Vietnamese food under the same roof, so the choices can be a bit overwhelming if you were just looking for one or the other. I happen to enjoy both, so this place was perfect.  I ordered the green curry with chicken - 3 stars on heat - since this was my first time here and I wanted to get acclimated to their spice levels. Good stuff, not eh best I;ve had but very creamy and very tasty, good heat at 3 stars too. One of my co-workers had the Pad Thai and raved about it, it did look very good. My other co-worker had a Vietnamese meal, pork and vermicelli noodles I believe, he seemed to very much enjoy it as well.  Overall, service was good, food was tasty and the fact that you can get both Thai and Vietnamese in the same restaurant pushes this locale from a three star rating to a four star in my opinion.",

The menu of around six pages was impressive enough, and for my brother's maiden attempt at Viet/Thai food, the choice was not easy. After sifting through soups, curries, and pad thai, he settled on a beef pad prik khing, a spicy red-curry based dish. I went with a pho do bien soup, and even though I thought that a brothy soup on a summer night might not be the best choice, the medium sized bowl was more than filling, and a pleasant variety of flavors. The soup menu is one of the biggest I've seen, and the pho I got had squid, fish balls, and crab in it, with some really great cilantro flavor. The condiment plates that come along with the soup have bean sprouts, basil, and jalapenos for a little more texture and taste. I saw families dining and quiet couples dining there (I guess we were a little of both). That's a pretty good indication of the atmosphere: not blaringly trendy and not tackily decorated. Charlotte actually has a pretty broad variety of ethnic restaurants, and it's safe to say this is one the city should treasure.",

Now let me preface this by saying I am not a connoisseur of Vietnamese or Thai food however I absolutely LOVE this restaurant and it has never disappointed.  Everything I have tried here from the Pad See Ew, to the Bun to the Pho has been amazing. Full of flavor, and the heat is made to your specifications.  Their medium hot is more like \"Thai Hot\" and I love it but it's also forewarning those looking for a True medium hot.  I have tried many of the other Thai places including Thai House and while some of them are good none of them compare to Viet-Thai in my opinion.  One of my foodie friends and I go here weekly, they know who we are when we walk in and the service is always impeccable.  It's located in the back of a strip mall off of HWY 51 and can be hard to find the first time you go looking for it but I guarantee you won't forget where it is!",

We ordered the large Tom Yum soup, Thai green curry, chicken satay and #93 (forgot what it was called). The large size soup was enough for 8 or 2 bowls to 4 people. The flavors of sour and spice was right on the money. But it was too salty for us. The Thai green curry was delicious. I was delighted to see chunks of eggplant in this dish. I LOVE eggplant. Again, it was a bit too salty. I didn't try the chicken satay. My son was disappointed it didn't come with peanut sauce. No problem, they brought the peanut sauce to us when we asked. I didn't try #93 which my husband ordered. Overall, we plan to go back this weekend. So glad its not that far of a drive because we will go more often then. My husband liked the green curry so much he said he will order it next time. I will order a noodle dish next time to try something different. We will also ask if they would lighten up on the salt.

Even than I was surprised to be confronted by an angry waitress who repeatedly commented that she \"Does not work for free.\" I will never return to this restaurant.",

The summer rolls were fantastic.  Very fresh and crispy.  I ordered the red curry and I forgot to increase the spicyness level but it was absolutely fantastic.  This was a stop on the way to the airport and I was wishing I could have ordered another dish to take home with me and unfortunately could not.",

    "text": "I am so glad I found this great noodle place because of the reviews on Yelp. This place has great noodles. I have been looking for crispy egg noodles for a long time and a lot of restaurants don't make crispy egg noodles the right way. Its pad thai is excellent not overly sweet. I got the tofu pad thai and it was great. I was eager to try the bubble tea based on the excellent reviews on bubble tea however it was not that great and pricey for bubble tea 4.50. Tapioca pearls weren't chewy and fresh. You can go to Super G or Grand Asia for bubble tea that don't cost that much. They do have ample of parking spaces you can park. If you go from 51 when you see Walgreens you have to make a right and then turn left on the first light and the restaurant is at the shopping center. Inside of the restaurant is very nice and cozy. If you are a noodle or a pho person this is the place you got to try. Staffs are friendly.",
