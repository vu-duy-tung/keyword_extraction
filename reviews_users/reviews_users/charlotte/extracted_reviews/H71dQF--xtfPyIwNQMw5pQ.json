    "text": "So I was introduced to this place one day at work when we received a tray of sandwiches for in service.  Initially, I wanted Sushi 101...but since that was closed (along with the rest of Charlotte) for Sunday lunch.... I noticed the Which Wich? sign across the parking lot.   Decided to try it out....  It took me about 5 minutes or so to figure out what the heck was going on with the ordering process.  After catching on, I thought it was genius.     Menu is set up by Numbered Categories.  Ie:  1- Beef, 2- Chicken, 3-Comofort Sandwiches...etc.   You select your number and then pull a brown sandwich bag off the wall with the corresponding #.   They have Red Sharpies so you can check off the other things you want to add.   (Let, Tom, Olive, Japs, Chz, pickle, etc etc...).     Take the bag to the register and the bag with your order is sent down the line.   You pick your bag up at other end of line.     Food was GREAT!   I don't know why I always go for the Comfort Food....but I had the best Egg Salad Sandwich.     The first time I tried it at work...the sandwiches were not dressed up.  When I had the opportunity to dress my Egg Salad up today... I was like \"OH MY....\"      Ice Machine has that fabulous \"hospital\" crushed ice pellets.  Inside seating area....LACKING..... it's Small...very McDonalds like.... but none the less that was no reason to pull back by a star on my rating.   Cheap, good, and fast..... WAY TO GO.     Which Wich? is now a staple in my weekly rotation of eating out.",

    "text": "Which Wich is your typical sandwich shop - no more, no less.  However, it's not the best sandwich I have ever eaten...  Pluses:  There is a wide selection of meats and toppings, and are of a higher quality than a place like Subway.  The bread is fresh baked, but there are only 2 options - white or wheat.    Negatives:  While well prepared, the taste was just not as good as I hoped.  It's on par with Subway to me.  Nothing that knocked me over.    I fancy myself a chip connoisseur and Which Wich has house-made chips.  Unfortunately, they were on par with Ruffles to me.  Nothing special, a very, very small bag of them and something I would not order again.   Verdict: While I had been tempted to stop by Which Wich for quite some time, I really could have waited longer.  I probably will not be stopping back there again, given there are better options to getting a similar sandwich.",

My favorites: - Cuban (ham/pork/swiss/pickles/mustard/extra meat) - Black bean (add pepper jack/lettuce/salt/pepper/spicy mayo/extra meat)  And they have the best ice around.  I know that sounds funny, you'll just have to try it for yourself.  Only thing I don't like is that ugly Tar Heel they have up.",

Small restaurant with an order area and pick up area. You start out by going to the wall of bags and choosing your sandwich. Literally...50+ sandwiches offered all for $5.25 (no side/drink). On my recent visit I went with the beefsteak and added as many toppings as I thought were necessary and good. Keep in mind, any fault here is most likely on you for building such a sandwich.  Mine was good, and I made it as \"philly\" as I could. I did an OK job, but the flavor was good. Also ordered the \"hot cookie\", which was a nice finish. You've got to check it out. Good place to stop for a quick bite to eat before a movie at Park Terrace across the street.",

My favorite \"wich\" is Chicken Pesto on a toasted wheat roll with jack cheese, pesto, jalapenos, and oil/vinegar.  AMAZING...everytime.

The ordering method is strange at first, but the learning curve is easy. Overall a good experience but $10+ for a 10\" sub with one meat and cheese, a bag of chips and drink is a tad pricey, so that knocks off a star.  Would recommend it!

Seeing as my ticket was the only one up there for a while this upset me. I heard girls in the back talking and laughing very loudly. So the line continued to grow as we were waiting to get our sandwiches made by the girls who were obviously preoccupied with other things in the back room.

I love this concept because you can get your sandwich exactly how you want it.  They even have sauerkraut.

I got it toasted with low fat mayo and all of the other toppings I wanted and it was perfect.  I would definitely go back here for a quick lunch.

I don't like standing across the counter from someone while they stare at me waiting for my decisions. I like to think my sandwiches over good and hard. The fact that I can grab a bag and create my sandwich in peace without feeling rushed and judged is a.m.a.z.i.n.g. The choices are excellent with a wide variety of toppings, meats, and bread, and if you don't want to think too hard about it, they have pre-fabricated options as well. I love handing my bag off, continuing my awesome conversation and then picking up my sandwich when it's complete. The sandwiches themselves are delicious. Cold or toasted, I have not been disappointed yet.",

    "text": "Which Wich is my Wich?  Honestly, I love all of 'em!   The thing that sets Which Wich apart from the rest isn't just the fun brown paper bags where you fill out your order (that does make ordering much quicker, which I like) but the way they use fresh ingredients and compact it into a hot, toasty hunk of bread.   The sandwich bags are categorized by meat, and it's super easy to customize with your red Sharpie.  Just circle or fill in the bubble of what toppings, condiments, seasonings, etc. you want. They even offer up a bean patty for veggies, which is very good.   Subway's toasted sandwiches always end up cold after awhile because of the veggies.    Jimmy Johns is fresh and yummy too, but has only a fraction of the meats and toppings...plus isn't toasted.   Quizno's I think is too expensive for what it is.   Firehouse is good, but again, I don't remember my few times there if there was a toasty crunchy bread option.   My only suggestion is offering a smaller half-sized sub.  After half a regular sized one, I'm usually packed because they're so dense!",

Service was good, but it was a bit slow because I went at the noon rush hour. The ordering system, as someone else commented, is unique.  It was a little confusing at first, but I think it did a good job of getting customers processed and out of the way. They actually take the orders faster than they can fill them, so I was waiting with 5-10 other people in the back of this small restaurant. Other than the wait, which was probably about 10 minutes, I have nothing bad to say.   I had a turkey sandwich that was pretty good, worth stopping for again. I'll definitely be returning, maybe just a little later after the rush hour.",

But as soon as i walked in, a very nice young lady walked over to show me how the ordering process works. :) You pick a type of sandwich, like ham, turkey, club, beef.. and then narrow your choice down to a specific sandwich, like Roast beef. Then you add all of the toppings, dressings and sauces that you want for basically no charge. You can totally make a crazy sandwich if you want!   I stood staring at the menu for a while and finally decided to go safe with just a turkey, ham and cheese sub with fixin's. I think I only went the safe route because I was worried that I would try something new and hate it..   The sandwich was as good as it could be considering it was so run of the mill. The ingredients tastes very fresh and the service was obviously awesome. The sub only took a few minutes to make and wasn't too expensive either. I am looking forward to returning to try many different options. Let me know if you know of any crazy good combinations that I should try!",

Apparently i like it, cause i'm thinking i will stick with that and maybe add something here and there until i find the perfect variation.  Seems to be a ton of choices overall. My mom tried the tuna melt type thing and seemed satisfied saying \"I'd get this again.\"   And the wife was right, i don't know why, but i love the little round perfectly bite sized cubes of ice. Crushed but not too crushed, cubed but not too big, the perfect ice. That ice machine would make a nice addition to my kitchen if anyone is looking for Christmas gift ideas.  Seating isn't terribly inviting, more like a fast food eatery, which i guess fits since it's a fast food eatery.",

I was impressed by the large number of sandwich options.  There are a ton of meats to choose from and even a decent sized vegetarian menu.  And all the sandwiches come with a seemingly endless amount of topping choices that are already included in the price (there are a few toppings that cost extra like avocado and bacon).  I really wanted to try the peanut butter, honey, and banana sandwich but the buffalo chicken was calling my name too.  I ended up with the buffalo chicken and I was not disappointed!  Everything about the sandwich was delicious from the yummy toasted wheat bread to the perfect amount of meat and toppings.  This might be one of my new favorite sandwich places.  I didn't try any sides but they have chips, cookies, and milk shakes available as well.  The atmosphere is kind of cold and boring with little to no decor and silver chairs with silver-topped tables, but their indoor space is really small and I don't know what else they could do with it.  Just a couple other notes...  The ice machine spits out little pieces of round crushed ice.  While this isn't a huge deal for me the hubby goes crazy over this stuff because he likes to eat it after finishing his drink.  I liked that they have one of those Gold Peak tea dispensers and plenty of Splenda to go around.  Glorious.",

First of all, the concept is cute and efficient. You fill out your order on a brown paper bag, hand it to the cashier, that bag then becomes the sleeve that will house your sub.   A big part of the sub is of course, the bread. I got my Which Wich toasted - it was done to perfection. Crunchy outside, soft inside, no burn. They give you a good amount of meat and toppings and I love the selection! Things like hummus and tzatziki, avacado, olive salad. Very unique.  When you go, try the house chips. The look of Ruffles, the crunch of Krunchers, with black pepper.   They also offer cookies & milkshakes, (Milkshakes! At a sub shop!), but I did not try either on this visit.  Great prices - just $5.25 for the regular (7\") sub. It of course goes up in there, but overall very affordable, especially compared to similar restaurants.  The staff was friendly, the atmosphere, casual and minimalist. Good thing it's close to work, because I think I will be stopping here a lot in the future!",

Parking can be difficult during busy times but usually its fairly easy.   I went on a nice Sunday afternoon and the place was packed. It took  about 10 mins to get our order once we had placed it.

The smallest sub on bread is 7 inches and it's nearly 8 dollars, and that's not including a side and a drink. Other than that...  I am a fan and will be back. I got the black bean patty and it was delicious. As soon as I walked in, someone showed me how they work (I was expecting a normal sub shop). Their ordering style is unique and in my opinion, the best. I wish other places would do it this way. I am usually indecisive when faced with a  menu full of items and often will rush my order just because I've felt stupid for staring at a menu while the cashier or sub-makers have a nearly impatient look on their faces that say \"come on, hurry up, stupid!\" Here, I don't have to worry about that because you just pick what you want, including all ingredients, and then go to the counter. Take all the time you need. It's easy. There wasn't a long line waiting on me, but if there was, I would scoot over and make room for them to make their order and get to the counter before me if they finished first. No big deal.   They have quite a selection and I found my black bean patty sub to be wonderful. I like how veggie friendly they are for us vegetarians. It's rare to see that here on the outskirts of Charlotte.  My step daughter got a bowl (sandwich ingredients in a bowl - no bread), and it also looked delicious.  The jalapenos seemed way more spicy here than at other places, to me. I just won't have them next time.",

    "text": "I have experienced better.  Is it bad? No. Does it blow you away?  Jury's out. Maybe I just got the wrong sandwich.  Went on a Saturday afternoon on the way to a movie.  First thing I see is an employee on break out front.  Relaxed, casual atmosphere.  We were first timers here.  It matters.  We see a menu wall and slots with numbered bags.  I'm not an attention whore when it comes to customer service.  Just give me the basics.  Kinda felt ignored.  Don't get me wrong, I hate that forced greeting you get from employees at other places we know.  But I kinda miss getting acknowledged.  My sister finally walked to the counter area and asked exactly how do you order here?  You'd think there would be something clear to nudge you along.  We get our confidence and I get the featured cheese steak, she gets the wicked. Cool sounding names for sandwiches. To the point: Hers tasted great to her.  It was good, I tried it. Mine, not so much. Really poor quality beef, that was assuredly kept in some kind of hot liquid that only kept it hot, not moist and leached it of all intended flavor while likely increasing the saltiness.  Portion wise she got some value; taste etc.  Mine was half the size of hers with little redemptive traits.  It had an adequate amount of the chewy meat but very little of any of the other ingredients. I do remember a mushroom.  Overall quality of meats cheeses above average, bread just ok.  Something to rave over? (shoulder shrug). Food was just okay. Cleanliness, maybe the guy on break could have wiped off some, any of the inside tables? Just saying.  Staff was friendly enough but at no time seemed concerned about the appearance of the dining room. Concept design more appealing to a specific group of people: the ones that like to walk into a place on their phone, order food, pick it up, eat etc while never leaving the comfort of their phone.  Human interaction is not a priority.  I probably don't get it and the sting of a $23 dollar tab on some sandwiches and sodas is a little off-putting. Would I go back again?  Nothing was really wrong, but then again, nothing was really right either.",

They customize your sandwich and if you want it toasted it goes into a conveyer belt oven like at Quiznos.  My first experience with Which Wich was ok.  I didn't realize until after I was done filling out my club bag that there were other options.  Well the club will do for now.  I handed my bag to the cashier, paid and grabbed my drink and waited in the cheap, uncomfortable furniture.  Seriously, next time go to IKEA and get your furniture.    The sandwich came out and it was a bit salty...I think it was the bacon which I didn't order.  Also the bacon was bacon pieces, not strips.  I didn't really like that either.

Our professor often discussed the lack of evolutionary changes in crocodilian species over the course of millions of years while other species have evolved all sorts of other features.  He basically said \"it's not possible to do what they do any better.  A bigger brain means they'd probably lose jaw muscle.  Larger body size means they'd probably lose some of their ability to sneak up on prey.  Over the course of millions of years, these things would be a big deal.\"  Point being, crocodiles haven't evolved because they're perfect as is for what they do.

Tons of options, all completely customizeable, fairly fast service, high quality ingredients, toasting capabilities, inexpensive, friendly staff that aren't afraid to interact with their customers, etc.  Perfect lunch spot.  It can get crowded (obviously a good problem to have), so come during off hours or plan on getting it to go.",

The new Which Wich opened a few weeks ago and ever since I heard it compared to Potbelly's I was on a mission to get there. I love, LOVE, me some Potbelly's so I was hoping Which Wich would provide the same access to tasty sammies and sides.  When hubs and I first walked in we were greeted by happy, smiley people, a super clean establishment and a really cool ordering system. Which Wich has an array of pre-stamped paper bags which you are to mark your sandwich type and toppings. All 'wiches are toasted, btw. I chose the turkey on wheat with pesto, avocado, tomato, lettuce and mozzarella.   Now, my sandwich was good but not great and it's mostly my fault. I probably shouldn't have gone with the pesto as it was a little too overwhelming with the dainty turkey. I tried hubs' beef cheesteak and it was really, really good. I may get that next time around. I, like Jason L, was blown away by the myriad of options here. Next time I'll be my careful choosing my toppings for my 'wich of choice!  BTW - they also serve breakfast sandwiches all day!",

And just the way you want it. You pick a brown bag that accompanies the type of meat that you want and proceed to use a sharpie to fill in the meat, cheese, toppings and spread. just the way you want it and in a cool way. They also have chips, cookies, rice krispy treats and shakes.   The sandwiches are very tasty and you can get a combo meal. They even do a punch card for frequent members for a free sub.   This one is closer to home so I tend to go to this one more often. Staff is great here too and it's not as busy as the one in Metro. Def recommend!!!",

I signed up for their email list, and they emailed me a coupon for a free sandwich during the week of my b-day.  I looked at the reviews and the website, so I knew about the ordering process.  You take a bag, mark what you want on with a Sharpie, and give it to the cashier.  They then make your sandwich and put in said bag.  It's a fun process, although I'm not crazy about community Sharpie's.  However, there is a lot of hand sanitizer, plus clean restrooms.  The sanitation grade is 101.  The free sandwich was for the 7\", but they now offer 10\" and 14\".  I upgraded to the 10\" and paid the difference.  The sandwich was good and I loved the toasted white bread without the whole sandwich being toasted.  Although I was expecting grilled chicken, it was lunch meat but good quality lunch meat.  They are a little skimpy with the toppings.  My wife order tomato and avocado (that is what the sandwich is called) but there was no avocado on it.  The quality here is better than Subway but not as good as Jersey Mike's. The prices are similar to JM's, so if paying full price, I'd rather go there, but I won't rule out or be oppossed to Which Wich.",

The parking situation was difficult, as this is an outdoor type shopping area with many stores and restaurants. After circling the parking lot a few times and dropping off my friends in front of Which Wich, i found a parking spot by a wine store. Note to self, check out wine store if I have time. But anyway I quickly joined my friends who had just ordered and placed my order. We sat at a table and waited for our orders and like magic a woman employee asked us our names and said she would bring our sandwiches to us. I love this. A fairy godmother at Which Wich. But anyway, we got our sandwiches from this wonderful employee and had a delightful lunch. This location is very busy, has lots of seating and is bright and cheerful. Great job for this Which Wich.",

You first pick your type of sandwich (meat, seafood, veg., etc.) then you pick the bread and fix-ins; and there are alot of those.  But here is the start on why I don't like the system.  You are creating your own sandwich, something that you think may go with something else may not and you ruin your sandwich.  Although I did enjoy my sandwich, the olive spread I put on it took away from the other ingredients.  If I wanted an olive spread sandwich I would have ordered that in the first place.  Second, the system ends up being a little slow if you have a group as each person orders one at a time.  By the time the last person got their sandwich, the first person was done.",

We called ahead to let them know they were coming, so they were prepared. They made everyone's sandwiches so quickly and were extremely respectful of our students and never seemed to get annoyed at them for any reason. They were efficient and all my students were satisfied with their sandwiches and milkshakes. After all our students went through the line, someone from the restaurant came around to each table (kids and chaperones) to check if everything was okay and if they could get them anything. I was super impressed with that. They even checked with us to see about when we would be back with another group on Thursday. They are supposed to have an audit that day, but never discouraged our group of teenagers from coming in.   On top of that, my sandwich was awesome!!! I had the club and I added fried onions and spinach, and it was one of the best sandwiches I had. I was impressed the quality was the same as if I would have gone at any other time. Two thumbs up!",

Once you decide which sandwich you want, you can get to work creating your masterpiece. I opted for the Classic- Club. Turkey, ham and bacon with pepper jack cheese.   For toppings I selected lettuce, banana peppers, jalapenos, red onions, deli mustard, chipotle mayo, vinegar and salt, pepper and oregano. I don't think I possibly could have added anything more.   The sandwich was delicious, I chose the wheat bread which was flaky and freshly baked. The sandwich was delicious! I enjoyed the combinations of meat and toppings and it was just a great sandwich.

    "text": "I had the opportunity to go to Which Wich on a recent Saturday afternoon, and my first impressions of Which Which are mostly positive.  What I like most about Which Wich is the uniqueness of the joint.  The whole order via circling your choices on a pad with a pencil; ordering format works, and reminds me of a burrito-joint in Chapel Hill by the name of Armadillo Grill.  I like that there really are no set, pre-made subs.  Everything is made fresh to order and is tailored to your specific topping and sauce needs.    I will say that the parking lot was a little hectic and the inside felt a bit chaotic as well.  There weren't many available seats and it looked like the Tasmanian Devil had just run through the place.  As far as the actual taste of my sub, it was excellent.  All the ingredients tasted fresh and my sandwich was made to my specifications.  Despite the interior, the service was excellent and the sub tasted good enough that I  would def like to return to Which Wich again, perhaps giving the location at the MET a shot.",

I went with the regular 7 inch turkey, toasted white bread, mayo,  avocado, bacon & pickles. Unbelievable! They offer the Vickie's line of kettle chips, which I love.  Staff was super friendly & helpful to this (new) process of ordering. And I am a stickler for sanitation grades & was happy to see this place has a 101 rating!  I went on a Sunday afternoon, right at 12, so there was a steady stream of church folks & 20-somethings. Service was quick. I will say the shop is rather small & the tables are placed close together. We didn't eat in, rather took our sandwiches to go.  Prices are reasonable. This is my new favorite go to sandwich shop.",

    "text": "I have been to Which Wich plenty of times, it is in my top 5 of sandwich shops.  They have awesome flavor to their subs.  My favorite is their buffalo chicken! They have so many different choices.  The shop is unique in how you order, but I love it.  You pick a bag, mark what you want on your sandwich and they make it.  They call your name when it is ready.  The only con: it can get busy fast, so the tables are taken and there is not much standing room without thinking you are in the way.  Grab a table quick!  Also get the club card, you get a free sandwich after buying so many.  I hope they open one on the south side soon!",
