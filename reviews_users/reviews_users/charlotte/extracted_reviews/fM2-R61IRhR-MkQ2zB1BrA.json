Let me just say that if you are looking for great wings, this is not the place. If you are looking for \"Buffalo Wings\" this is definitely not the place! I am from Buffalo so I was expecting some really crispy, hot, saucy wings. What I got were some subpar, breaded wings akin to what you might find on a Chinese buffet which are definitely NOT Buffalo Wings in any capacity. Despite getting something other than Buffalo Wings, I decided to give them a try. They were really grizzly and had this nasty freezer burnt taste. Needless to say I gave them to the cat.   I also ordered a slice of pepperoni to go. It was humongous! Sadly, the size was about all it had going for it. Maybe it would've been better if I ate it at the restaurant but it was just OK. Plus I came a little bit later in the day and I'm not sure how long that pizza had been sitting out. I've had better for sure.   My main critique is the wings. Horrible. Do not get them. The pizza- jury is out on that. I would try it again however I would dine in and come back during a busier time when the pizza might be fresher.",

I'm about to move across town, and I will occasionally come back to get this white pizza. It's just a ricotta base and mozzarella. After I ordered I started wishing I had added spinach, but after one bite I was so glad I didn't. It was just so pure and amazing as is. I'm a person that loves complex flavors, but this pizza is simple and divine. A small is 16\" (a pretty large small) and was 10.95 plus tax. They also deliver. I got it to go but I noticed that the restaurant is exceptionally clean inside. I know it's fairly new, but I also know how fast a kitchen can get dirty and this place was sparkling.",

I used to deliver pizza up north in a place that has been open for 50 years (one of the first pizza places in the area) and has delicious pizza.  This place has the best NYC style pizza down in Charlotte.  When I walked in for the first time I looked at the pizza (looked good), looked at the wall and spotted a picture of NYC (good sign), and then I watched the guy making pizza.  It took me about 5 seconds to see that he knew what he was doing.  It looked like when the original owner of the pizza place I worked at up north was making pizza.    The slices are HUGE (the fact that this guy can even stretch the dough that big shows he is a pro) and delicious.  This place could fit right in up north and do well...that is saying a lot for a place in Charlotte.  Great pizza, good prices.  Just get a slice and try to tell me its not delicious.",

I ordered delivery for a meeting once and they forgot a persons salad. They told me to come pick one up. Today, they forget to give a receipt. So I call them up and ask if the manager could either fax or email me a copy. They told me that they didn't have the capabilities to do that. I asked if the manager had a smart phone and told the girl if he did then all he had to do is take a picture and text or email it to me. Takes 10 seconds. Again, they refused to do this for me. They told me to come pick up the receipt lol. It's unfortunate that their customer service and nonchalant attitude is this way because the food is actually good. What they need is a owner and manager that cares about their customers. No one is ever there in charge or at least that's what I'm told. Today was the last straw for me. If you don't care about customer service or correct food orders then try it out.",

Their customer service is rather lacking, more like 2 stars.  I called to place a to go order after a very long Saturday running errands,  I hadn't eaten all day and was looking forward to a DaVinci's pizza.  I called to place my order at 9:35pm (the website states that they are open until 10pm.)  I know 9:35pm seems very specific, but I was so floored after making the call I checked my cell phone to see what time I placed the call.  When I called, they refused my order stating they were only doing \"fast food\"  at that time.  If they are going to be open until 10pm, they need to work/take orders until closing time.  I have worked in the service industry and we all hate when customers show up 5-10 min. before closing, but we dig in, smile and serve them because they are the customer.  I can understand if I was calling with a large multi-pizza order 5 minutes before closing, but placing an order 25 minutes before closing does not seem unreasonable to me,  This is not the first time I have called \"late\" around 9:30pm to order.  Another time I called they took my order but not until after they made sure I was aware they closed at 10pm and they asked me if I was sure I could make it by 9:55pm.  Again, I understand after working a long day that leaving on time is great, but never in the service industry have I been able to leave the minute the doors close.",

The salads are better than average in my opinion.   If you order carryout pizza you won't be disappointed the large pizza just barely can be crammed in the box, and the drive home will seriously challenge your temptations with the smell. The place is clean and service is good. Last but not least you cannot beat the value, a carry out large cheese is $15, and as I said earlier it barely fits into the box.

    "text": "Let me start by saying I loved Da Vinci's pizza. I always order the same thing, pizza and buffalo wings with buffalo sauce (that they ALWAYS forget unless I ask for extra then I only get one) calling to order a pizza for delivery and was told they were not taking anymore orders for delivery. At 7:30pm on a Sunday. Really? I just want to stay in my pajamas and enjoy a pizza. If you take delivery orders until 8, I'm not really sure what the issue is? This happened a few weeks ago on a Saturday as well I went to order a pizza around 6 and the lady that answered tried to talk me out of ordering delivery because it was \" an hour and a half\" wait. That's fine. I don't mind waiting. Are you SURE it could be like 2 hours. That's fine I don't mind waiting. I could almost hear here rolling her eyes over the phone. Well we are really busy and it will be a long wait. Yup, got that, I still don't mind. This place is good, but avoid delivery, it is not worth getting hackled every time you dare say you'd like to place an order for delivery on the weekend. As important as good food is, don't get me wrong the pizza is absolutely AMAZING the customer service is just not worth it. To be fair, the delivery drivers are always super fast and friendly, that  1 1/2 to 2 hour wait? Was less than 30 minutes. But this is just the last time I'll bother calling for delivery, there are plenty of other places that will give you a lot less grief when you'd like a pizza delivered.",

One slice of plain cheese is enough to fill me up as the slices are enormous.  The girl working the cash register at both locations is so friendly.  She always checks to be sure our pizza is to our liking (we generally order extra crispy) and fixes it if not.  This is the type of employee every business should have.    The garlic knots are also delicious.  VERY garlicky with chunks of fresh garlic caked all over the them.  The outside is crispy and the inside is soft and doughy.    After complaining about the lack of good NY style pizza in Charlotte for years, I have finally found my go-to place.",

I arrived shortly before 12 and was the second person there, however, by 12:00 the place was packed. There are several booths and multiple tables in the restaurant. Upon ordering you receive a number and they call it out and deliver your order to you, which was nice. I chose the slice of pepperoni, my typical choice, and a side salad. The salad was crisp & fresh, and huge for a side salad. However, the ranch dressing was definitely out of the jar, I am thinking Hidden Valley, ha ha! As for the slice, great size, but it was a little cool and the sauce, although light, reminded me of jarred sauce too. It didn't have the freshness that some pizza sauces have. Great prices, quick service, an overall nice lunch. If in the area again I would stop in again.",

This place charges 2.50 for a huge slice of cheese or pepperoni pizza (35 cents for other toppings) and just cannot be beat for the price. In addition to that, I ordered a side of their meatballs as well. The meatballs and the sauce were excellent, and the best I have had at a restaurant in quite a while.   The slices came out piping hot, and although they were a little greasy for my taste (another sign of authenticity), that did not matter since I was able to blot it out, and enjoy both slices anyway.       The customer service here was great, and the decor was fine with some very comfortable furniture. I came here just after a blackout hit the area, and they were still open and accepting customers (although you had to pay cash to order something).   All that being said, while the pizza wasn't entirely my favorite, this place more than makes up for it with its great prices, great service, and best of all, great meatballs! I would definitely come here again if I was in the mood for a cheap and quick bite to eat.",

The slices are massive, and very filling. The sauce is amazing. We have also ordered wings and the wings are absolutely delicious. The only thing I wish they added on their menu is chicken rolls because I love chicken rolls and it is a common thing sold in pizzerias, but unfortunately they do not make them.",

I ordered a pizza over the phone. When I arrived I went to pay for my order. She mentioned my food wasn't ready. I waited and waited and as they kept calling orders ahead of me I was patient. I'm sure some people ordered ahead  Finally I had to go up to the counter and ask for my pizza that was just sitting there getting cold.   When I asked why didn't they inform me my food was ready the cashiers response was I didn't make your food.   The cook and other cashiers laughed. Needless to say I will never buy pizza here again. Plenty of other fish in the sea.",

Experience: Knowing we had a lot of people to feed, I called ahead 20 minutes to order 3 large pizzas so they could be close to finished when we arrived.  Within 5 minutes of us sitting, the first pizza arrived, followed closely by the other two.   We had pitchers of water brought out regularly and everyone had an enjoyable experience.  Food: The pizza here is thin New York style with the grease you would expect if you like NY pizza!  It has a good fresh taste (can't vouch for ingredients used).   Portions: 1 slice of a large pizza is twice the size of most pizza slices, so a medium should feed a family of 4 well, and a large would have some left overs for most families.   Overview: This was our second visit but it impressed me that they handled our size group so easily with a little heads-up notice before arriving, and pizza quality was great.",

This restaurant is in a newly built strip so everything is nice and new. It is your average pizza parlor - casual, booths and tables, order at the counter.   This location has the same great combos available. The combos are in the $7-10 range, so very reasonable for lunch OR dinner (you can get the combo all day long). I usually go for the slice and salad combo. The salads are pretty good, and they give you enough ranch for the ever important dipping of your crust at the end!   They have free wi-fi which is nice if you need that!   If you want good New York style pizza check out Da Vinci's!",

    "text": "No bueno.. I don't know about the rest of their food but I'd pass on the pizza especially the single slices.  For one, the slices are smaller then the other pizzerias for the same price. Second, the bread is so flimsy (dough to thin) that when you pick it up it clasps in your hand.  I can't Imagine having any toppings on it. I just had a plain cheese pizza smh. I know good Italian pizza and this just isn't it.   I recommend going to any Tony's pizza before going to this place if you want GOOD pizza.",

Today, they got our order wrong, they didn't deliver us enough food. They were rude and refused to make it right. Our food also arrived cold. It is very disheartening to see a business change like this, it was before really good.",

After an IKEA visit, I remembered Ryan G said that this place had the best NY Style pizza in Charlotte. It was an easy decision to stop in before heading on to some breweries. The pizza looked and smelled great. I ordered the pepperoni and plain. In a day and age where people are trying to cut back on sodas, I wanted a cup of water. Sorry, we only sell bottles. But there's a soda fountain right behind me that has a water dispenser?? Poor form in my book - charge me for the cup if you have to... Or if you had beer, I would have bought a beer.  I will admit the pizza was really good. It was pretty authentic. I like it when there's a little crispness to the crust after a quick reheat.  The not so good part is the amount of trash all over the place. The shop was not busy, but there were four people standing around behind the counter.  In the dining room, the trash cans were overflowing with trash on the floor and under some of the tables. Jeez - not a great first impression.   Apparently this place does have a pretty big following and does a brisk business (especially with it located in The University area). And yes they do have good pizza and yes I will be back, and hopefully someone has swept the floors...",

    "text": "Worst experience of my life. My family and I typically go to Giacomo's but they were closed so we decided we would try a new place. When we got there it was pretty much empty but every table I tried to sit at was dirty. I eventually ended up cleaning my own table off. We ordered a pizza and wings. The food came in a timely manner. The pizza was almost twice the size of the paper plate so it was unavoidable for the pizza slice to not be all over the table. The \"plate\" was made of thin paper and became drenched in oil from the pizza. The pizza was just average but we did not like the wings so I kindly went to the lady at the cashier and ended up swapping the wings for cheese sticks. The cheese sticks came straight from the freezer (I saw them take it out of the freezer and literally just throw it in the fryer) they had an off taste to them. So I talked to the manager about the appetizer and he looked at me like he was confused. And kept asking me why I did not like them and I said they taste freezer burnt. And again he continued to look at me like I had three heads. He than proceeded to ask me, \"is this your first time\". I don't see how this is relevant to my horrible experience. Are new customers unwanted? Because that is sure how I felt. He was very rude so I asked for a box so that my family and I could leave. He THAN stares at me the whole time while talking to another associate. This was my first and last time I will ever go to Davinci's.",
