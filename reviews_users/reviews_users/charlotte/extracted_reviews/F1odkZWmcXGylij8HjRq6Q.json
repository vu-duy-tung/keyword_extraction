    "text": "VBGB has it all: a name the rhymes with heeby-jeeby, a frosty strip of bar to keep your beer cold, a wealth of beer from both local and national microbreweries on tap, 90s music, games out back, and a fabulous array of food. And with $2 beers on Tuesday nights, I defy you to find a reason not to go. Ok, the location at the Music Factory may be a little inconvenient, but that is the only negative that I see.  The buttery pretzel is a requirement for anyone visiting, as it complements your beers nicely, as well as come with beer cheese (similar to the orange nacho cheese, but with a beer-twist). Adding further legitimacy, they offer the coarse-grain mustard that is a requirement for anything claiming to be a beer hall. Goes goes perfectly with anything from pretzels to sausages. I was a little less impressed with the sauerkraut, but that may be my spoiled eastern European heritage speaking.  Long wooden communal tables and even a private room make this a great place for hanging out with groups as well. Hope to see you there!",

Ive had the pretzel, grilled cheese, chicken bites and buffalo chicken egg rolls and would order all of them again.  The venue also has a game area with chess, corn-hole, connect four, jenga, etc.  Lastly, two dollar (drafts) Tuesday is always a good option.  In summary, I'll be back.",

We had no issues finding a space for all of us inside on a picnic table to watch the game.  We also were going inside and outside a bit to place games out on the patio.  Life size Connect-Four....how cool!  My second visit was with my guy friend.  We just chilled at the bar and enjoyed a couple drafts.  I tried one of the pumpkin beers rimmed with cinnamon and sugar.  Yum!  On this visit I discovered the frozen strip at the bar to keep your beer super cold.  How cool!!!  They have specials every day....called 4,3,2,1.  I think both days the $4 were of the wine variety and the 3&2 were of the beer family, with the 1 including free beer sauce or something.  If you are a Rochester, NY native- THEY HAVE ZWEIGLES HOTDOGS here!  Lol....I couldn't even believe my eyes when I saw it on the menu, not realizing this place had NY roots.  I don't like hot dogs, but I like Zweigles!  They also use Dinosaur BBQ (another Upstate NY gem) products....I love feeling at home while living in (my new home) the Queen City!!!",

    "text": "VBGB is one of my favorite places in the NC Music Factory. Both the indoor and outdoor seating are much to be envied by other bars.   The bar has tons of local beers on draught. NoDa, Birdsong, OMB, Natty Greene's, and plenty of others. If the weather is poor, from rain or sweltering heat, take a seat at the bar and rest your frosty glass on the ice rail. Yes, it's like a gift from the beer-filled heavens. What an incredible and innovative idea. It keeps your beer icy and gives the kids something to play with!  The food is grade A bar food. Grilled pretzels with beer cheese, brats, dogs, and wings. The best things we've had have been the hippie nachos. Complete with crumbled blackbean burgers and nacho cheese. The fried banana peppers are to die for and are great on everything you can get your beer-drinking hands on. The pretzels.....oh, sweet lord. Amazing. I've been hard pressed not to drink the cheese at times. Salty and perfect consistency.   I love that this place is kid friendly. Sure, there's tons of booze flying by and it can draw a bit of a rougher crowd, but take the kids in for a hotdog on the patio at lunchtime and it's better than a ballpit. Tons of games for the kids to play out back and the staff is so friendly. The bartenders were giving the kids straws and other things to play with on the ice rail at the bar. How nice is that? Definitely a plus for those who have little ones and had to forgo a sitter.   VBGB is a perfect afternoon spot for a beer and brat. Great to watch the game or have a patio lunch with the fam. High-fives all around!",

The 2nd time wasn't as charming. When we got there and all of the volleyball courts we taken so we were just waiting for one to clear up. Finally, when we got a chance to get on a court around 10:00. The lights turned off, which isn't a big deal because we played in the dark the first time. Then a blonde girl (not sure if she's apart of VBGB staff because she wasn't wearing uniform) barged on the courts and disrespectfully, kicked us off the court. Someone probably pissed in her cereal that morning because she had the biggest attitude. Which started to annoy us because she was so rude about.   Not a big deal, we let it slide and got off the courts but we were confused because we were able to play volleyball on the courts until midnight the day before. But no, it doesn't end there. She went around to all of the servers, talking *excuse my language* shit about us. That's when lines have been crossed. This place has so much potential but unfortunately, staff members needs a lot of attitude adjustment. Rude service calls for rude customers. And for the blonde girl that disrespected my family, well I hope your day is at least a little better than your personality (:",

If you want to find a place where you want to actually do something, other than just mingling and drinking beer - this is the place.  Price - I like to take shots, so the prices are a bit high, I went for the $5 specials.  Venue - I really enjoyed the layout of the place.  Upon entering the establishment, the bar is straight aheade, and you can order your food items to your right.  If you enter through the right back, you will get to the game room section.

The beers are grouped by type so it makes it easy if you want to find a new IPA or Stout. They also have three sizes you can order - a small pint through large German beer mug size.   Their food is quite delicious. From something to munch or a full fledged meal you can find something tasty. I recommend the sweet potato fries. They come w a delicious honey mustard sauce.   Activities galore!  There are connect four games, giant chess, corn hole and in the summer volleyball too. The place is dog friendly which is much appreciated for us dog owners.

The bartender told me they only have two small dishwashers and that they wouldn't be able to keep up if they did offer glasses...oh well.

However the i'd have to assume the beer taps or lines were not cleaned properly... The beer i drank (Port City Essential Pale) had a metallic aftertaste which lingered on the palate.. The beer was not drinkable and poured it out without saying anything, It would have took longer for me to speak with the bartender then it would for me to leave... My assumption and experience is that many beginning bartenders touch the tap on the inside of the glass when pouring making the beer taste like crap. The crowd was very mixed and the music was very random, One second playing Top 40 and the next second playing something i would hear at a Los Angeles rave party. And was not suitable for the crowd that was inside which was fairly middle aged.",

With picnic tables set up and a place to walk up order food and beverage you can't go wrong with throwing on comfy clothes and hanging out.   I had a burger with sauteed onions and green peppers and some tots. The burger was the perfect size and delicious and the tots were as good as tots get. I was a little bummed they were out of a few things when I went but I still had a good experience and enjoyed the atmosphere greatly. They are quick to clean up your mess which is helpful. Hope I can make it here when I'm in Charlotte again.",

And they have a really neat ring of ice that goes along the bar to sit your beer on keeping good and cold. They had at least 25 craft beers to choose from and I liked all 3 that I had.  On to the food. First we had the soft pretzel  with beer cheese and let me tell you that was the BEST SOFT PRETZEL I've ever had. There is a place in Philadelphia that visit every time I go just to get this pretzel made by an Amish family. VBGB's was better. 2nd we got the loaded nachos and these left a lot to be desired. We only ate a few and decided we didn't want anymore. I told the bartender we didn't like them and almost immediately the manager came over and apologized. Even refunded the back the money for them without us asking. I was blown away how great they treated us, all because we didn't like the nachos. The manager even gave me a free beer. It's great customer service like this that will keep bringing me back for more. In the end we ordered a black bean burger on a pretzel roll and it was great. If your headed to a concert next door this is the place to visit.",

You can spend an entire day here doing different activities and trying new types of beer. Their food is surprisingly really good too - my favorite thing to get is the tater tots with fire sauce which is seriously addicting. I personally have found it difficult to meet new people in Charlotte but the games they offer actually make it easy to introduce yourself or invite new people to play with you. The whole vibe at VBGB is just really fun and relaxing- everyone goes there to have fun without any pretenses. It is kid/dog friendly too! The bartenders have always been friendly and quick, so you never have to wait long to order another beer.   If you're looking for a fun way to spend an afternoon, check out VBGB during the day and then head over to 8.2.0 next door for karaoke, arcade games, a speakeasy, and pizza. Or just stop by VBGB before/after a show at the Fillmore!",

The place itself is huge both inside and outside so I was worried about finding a table for our group but that was not an issue.   We walked up to get a beer, the line moved slower than I expected. The beer selection was alright, the ciders were way overpriced in my opinion. We all got a 34oz pours of the beer of our choice. Then my boyfriend and I made our way over to order food, we decided to split an order of potato latkes and a fruit salad. Whoa, those potato latkes were WAY over seasoned.. I had to smother them in sour cream to finish eating them.   I think that this is definitely a spot that I would enjoy better on a nice Spring or Fall day instead of coming at night. With that being said, I would go to check it out again on a day drinking adventure and to play volleyball and a few of the oversized games that they have available.",

There is an indoor area where the food ordering station also is, as well as an awesome bar with a cold strip that keeps your beer cool even if you order the huge size in the summer. Then out back is a patio and deck with more long tables as well as tons of fun games like oversize connect four, oversize jenga, and of course corn hole. Then, to the side are volley ball courts where there is actual league play on some nights.  The indoor area has a few TVs but I definitely wouldn't call this place a sports bar. It's more of a hang out and spend time with friends type of place. The beer selection is ample and delicious, but they do have wine and hard liquor too.",

    "text": "We came here on a Saturday night with some friends who live in Charlotte.  We walked up to where you order food and the friendly cashier helpfully explained the ordering process and gave us a lay of the land.  She suggested two pretzels for the four of us but honestly one would have been plenty for everyone to try it.    The pretzels were HUGE!  They were delicious, piping hot with grill marks and dripping with butter.  The (beer) cheese sauce that accompanied the pretzels was average and had no discernible beer flavor at all.  It just tasted like standard food service issue nacho cheese.  It would be nice to see a mustard option which would be a little Truer to the beer garden experience.    For food, we also went with an order of fried pickles.  These also came out piping hot, with a crispy coating around good-size tangy and flavorful pickle slices.  Five yelp stars on those bad boys!  We also got onion rings and sweet potato fries - both were served hot and had good flavor.  After all that I was so full I just split a chicken skewer which was okay but my least favorite item I tried.  The chicken and veggies on the kabobs had decent flavor but were pretty dry.    As for atmosphere, we sat in the tented outside area.  It's the middle of January but it is well-heated and was very comfortable.  Seating is at large communal tables and the place is pretty big.  People all around were having lots of fun playing the various games - giant connect 4, ping pong, giant Jenga, cornhole and board games.  The staff would come by regularly and pick up trash and empty glasses.  There was sort of a club/dance music that got progressively louder as the night went on.    Ordering drinks was easy - you just walk up to the counter and order.  They will keep a tab open for you and also let you sample beers before you commit to a full glass.  The beer list was great!  I got to try an Apricot Saison from Wicked Weed brewery up in Asheville.    All in all, I had a blast here and I would definitely be up for coming back.  I'd love to try some different food items and play the games.  I also thought the frosty bar inside is a really cool idea.  There are a number of pics of it on here already.  My review is for a solid four stars.  I was tempted to go five, but the food wasn't out of the park exceptional and I wish you had a dedicated server so you don't have to go up to various windows to order.",

VBGB is in the back of the music factory behind the Time Warner Cable Amphitheater. A big plus about VBGB is that they have their own parking lot and you do not have to park in the dirt lot across the street.   Once you walk in VBGB your welcomed right away. It certainly does have the beer garden, concert concession feel to it. There are large picnic tables surrounding a large U shaped bar. There is a separate concession stand where you order your food. The bar itself has an ice top to keep your pint glass on to keep cold. The beer list is great. Unlike some of the other comments, I felt the prices were really fair for what you got. You can choose between multiple size glasses and almost everything can be purchased in a pitcher.  The food there is what I would call concert concession food with a twist. We had the house made chips with the pretzels and beer cheese. It was the perfect food to go with the beer. Between the pretzel and the beer cheese it was rather filling. So much so that we considered it our dinner. From what I hear is that their Brats and hot dogs are wonderful as well.  One of the great features about VBGB is there is plenty of fun either inside the bar or outside. There is a ping pong table inside  and out. There is also a few corn hole set ups outside. The big plus is that you do not have to go back inside to get your beer. There is a beer window to the bar from the outside. Don't worry there is also plenty of propane heaters outside to keep you warm in the winter.",

Picnic table seating allows space for large groups with the opportunity to actually converse.   Nice selection of beer. The ice rail around the bar is pretty cool and definitely unique. i think this place is a worthy destination to hang out with friends. They do actually have 2 tvs in the bar area now and according to twitter, they intend to get some tvs for the patio. Every day they have certain specials with something for $4, $3, $2, $1. i like it.    i regret not hitting up this place at all during the warmer months.

No cover, cool people, very entertaining even to just sit there and watch the crowd. Nothing bad to say besides the kitchen not being open all night. Fyi, stay away from the jalapeno beer, its not good. I come here all the time and would recommend it to anyone. A must visit place in Charlotte!",

    "text": "I really love this place. HUGE patio with picnic tables, ping pong & corn hole, great beer selection that actually changes and awesome German style food. If you only go once, you MUST have the soft pretzel. It has supposedly been voted best pretzel in Charlotte and I see no reason to argue! The pretzel is almost as big as my head, perfectly salted, chewy and warm off the grill. It comes with some pretty awesome beer cheese sauce for dipping too! Their Zwiegles are delicious too; although, I have only tried the original. I will actually be returning tomorrow so I may try something new.. but it's so hard to stray from the pretzel!   VBGB is very unique and some may find it boring if you don't know what you are in for when hanging out here. There are only TWO tvs, and those were just added recently. VBGB is a beer garden (or as close as it gets here) in Charlotte and a lot of us Charlotteans are not familiar with the concept. This is not a sports bar, and it's not meant to be a super busy, noisy place. (Although, it does get VERY busy when there are concerts at The Music Factory.) Their menu is also not typical bar food; it's much better! This is a great place to bring friends, even doggie friends, to sit around, chat, eat and enjoy different beer. There is no entertainment but they do play music through their speakers. So, when you do visit, make sure it is with people who you don't mind actually TALKING to! :)  Bottom Line: Try different brews, Eat the pretzel, Play ping-pong, Enjoy the patio while you can!!!",

They have beers from almost every local brewery in addition to beers from everywhere.  If you're like me and have a hard time deciding or do not want to commit to a particular beer, you can a flight of four 5 ounce beers.  The full beers are served in German style glass mugs.  They also have ice rails on the bar in case you're drinking a crappy beer that needs to be enjoyed cold.  they serve food too - my friends said the pretzel was awesome.  They also have some games like Jenga as well as ping pong tables.  They have a small parking lot too (rare for the factory), plus one of the free lots is right across the street.",

    "text": "Do you like beer? I mean not in the casual, crack open a bottle on a hot day way. I mean do you really like beer? Because VBGB has is an they will sell it to you in a mug as big as your head (if you want).  I must applaud that they do their best both to cover the spectrum of beer types, having at least a few wheats, ales, lagers and darks on tap at all times, but also to represent the local breweries. The house brew is by Four Friends and along with a few other FF offerings they have OMB, and Red Oak on the regular. Prices average around 5-7 for a Mittel which I imagine is a pint but feels so much more gratifying in a hearty glass mug. Most of their beers come in both a smaller and larger serving as well, with the exception of some of the high gravity business.  The food is surprisingly good. Sure, its pretty standard bar fare (burgers, chicken wings, onion rings and the like) but its not phoned in. They use Dinosaur BBQ sauce which is near and dear to my heart and taste buds, but the clear winner is the soft pretzel with cheese. So freakin' delicious. I want to be eating one right now.  You can't talk about VBGB without mentioning the patio.  They claim it's the biggest in CLT and if it isn't it's sure close.  There are plenty a picnic table & umbrella to sit under while you sip or sup and if you like a little sport with your brew they have cornhole boards and ladderball sets. You can even bring your furry friend. Add to that windows in to the bar so you don't have to go back in to refuel and you have to say they really know how to play the patio game.  I like VBGB. I like it a lot, plain and simple and I'm fairly sure they have guaranteed that no one is going to spend their whole paycheck on 3 beers at a show again.",

This is a nice place to visit while at the NC Music Factory complex (Time Warner Uptown Amphitheater) The beer selection is very good, the bartenders are very knowledgeable, and are very patient about explaining and suggesting different brews. Be warned though, this is not the place to go to get your cheap drink on before a show at the amphitheater- the beer is a little pricey- No dollar fifty PBR's here~  VBGB is a pretty big place with a nice big bar that has the frozen ice rail to keep your beer cold- nice touch, if you can manage to get a seat at the bar - It was crowded the day we were here for a concert. The bar is in a \"W\" shape and when you first come in to the place it appears kind of chaotic. You can go to the side of the bar to order a beer, but then you can't see the chalk board menu over the bar...Oh well~  VBGB does have a huge outdoor patio- However it needs some shade!!! It's a wide open space that gets cooking hot during the day!  No critiquing of the food here, didn't get a chance to taste anything. Come to think of it, I didn't really see anybody else partaking of food either...",

Everything this places advertises on it delivers. The bar is nice open and clean and the staff is warm and inviting even in times of high volume rushes. When you walk in you'll notice that this place doesn't look like you typical gastropub but has a nice laid back feel with long tables and a bar with an ice shelf.   There is a large patio out back that is great for relaxing underneath this huge neon sign which adds to the ambiance of the patio. The last time I was there, the patio boasted a large chess/checker set.    There is a side room that an organization I belong to rented out that was very nice and private and at relatively low cost. It also has its own private outdoor patio. The menu selection here is great! The are food specials here almost every day. The fare here is a different kind of bar fodder with everything from burgers to edamame. This place is worth the try if you are looking for a young and hip spot for a rising young professional that needs a place to blow off some steam.",

    "text": "We came here on a Saturday night.  The beer list and specials were great.  They have 4-3-2-1 specials that cover both food and beer options.  It was my lucky night because they had Son of a Peach on special, definitely my favorite summer beer.  The bartenders were awesome.  I overheard a couple people asking for recommendations in ear shot. He asked what they liked and immediately knew what type of beer to bring over, judging from the reactions his picks were pretty spot-on.    I was looking at the giant board they have behind the bar showing the different types of beer they offer and was pretty surprised at how good the prices were.  It is not out of the ordinary to be charged $7 or $8 for different types of craft beers, the prices here stayed around $4-$6.  The menu offerings were also very unique, everything from potato latkas to cinnamon pretzel twists...I'll definitely be ordering some small appetizers next time they come.    There is also a giant chest board on the back patio as well as different board games you can grab and play.  The DJ was great and had a good mix of old and new stuff.  I was expecting it to be slightly more crowded on a Saturday night.  All and all there is good beer, good selections, great bartenders, and definitely a great atmosphere.",

I was immediately roped in and gave a shout of cheer when it fell so I could take the wheel of my own thoughts again.   I wasn't impressed with my choice of beer, Dogfish Head's Black&Red stout.. The flavor profile threw me way out of my orbit but I was a tropper and then the Catawba Valley White Zombie witbier brought me down to earth. I did think that the local beers should be at most $4, because of the proximity and to encourage ppl to drink local brews.   Note: Don't make the mistake I did. If you order your beer before you go to the bathroom, make sure your co-evening partner takes it off the frozen bar strip.. Otherwise, you may spill your beer all over yourself trying to detach it :)  Good experience, good dj, friendly bar staff, clean bathrooms, and outdoor patio!",

We grabbed a drink inside first but the service just wasn't up to par this time. the wait was very long and honestly service wasn't very personable. I asked whether a specific beer was sweet to which he assured me it wasn't.  It was almost sickeningly so (in my opinion), but he ran away so quickly and the line took so long that I just stuck with it..Also, much to my surprise he just assumed I wanted the large size so I was stuck with a bigger amount of it too. The place was busy but I felt like the bartenders had a tough time keeping up with the demand.   Outside looks awesome but there were so many things to do (table tennis, large connect four, large chess, jenga etc.) that it took up the most room and there wasn't very much seating. I wouldn't have really cared about sitting so much but the large mugs are very heavy and it would have been nice to be able to set my drink down every so often. I know it sounds silly but those things were solid!   We recently bought some sort of deal for this place so I am sure we'll be going back and I hope it was more like my first visit than my most recent. Fingers crossed....",

I hadn't heard of the beer makers before, but the bartender gave us samples to see what we liked.  I also had a brot and the big pretzel with cheese dip.  Both were very tasty.  The layout is interesting.  There are lots of long tables with benches inside and it looked like behind the bar is an outdoor area with tables (enclosed by a tent).  It's counter service for beers and food.  I would highly recommend hitting this place before seeing a concert at the Fillmore or the Uptown Amphitheatre.",

The beer selection was, of course, fantastic and both the indoor and outdoor seating areas are quite nice.  The real standout, however, was the nachos we ordered. Now, I love nachos of all kinds and it's really hard to go wrong with nachos. But, it's also really difficult to have outstanding nachos. VBGB has done it. I couldn't get enough of their beer nacho cheese and mango salsa and I can't wait to go back just to get their nachos again.",

Here are some reasons it's worth checking out:  -The space is HUGE, they have an indoor bar with plenty of seating and a giant patio. The patio space is split, half is covered with a giant canvas tent and half is open. No matter what the weather, you can find the perfect place to hang out. You can reserve space for parties as well. -There are so many things to do! VBGB has multiple full sized beach volley ball courts (very popular in Charlotte), on the patio they have giant chess, giant connect four and giant jenga. They also have ping pong tables and corn hole...there is always something to do. -Event nights. Check out their social media/website to see what they have scheduled for the week. Life music nights and trivia nights are very popular. -THE FOOD! The food is super good. Get a pretzel, the totchos, latkes or any of the other items off the menu...you won't be sorry. Bonus! It's priced well. -The options for drinks. This is a bier garten--so the list of beer available is giant. Take a second to really go over what they have on tap before going to your regular brew. You can sample everything, and you can purchase all beer in a pitcher for sharing. In addition to the beer, there is a full bar for the non-beer drinkers.   Parking across the street is easy to get to and it's free!",

Great selection of beers, cider for them, and a very extensive menu of pub offerings.   The kids loved it! Tons of games..... From board games, to life sized connect 4, and ping pong to beach volleyball this place has it all. It a wonderful place for families and a place I would go to solo and sit at the bar.

The staff is also very knowledgable of their beers and there is a different choice of sizes - whether you really thirsty and want to have a good time - there's a whole pitcher or if you just want to relax there's also 12 oz 15 oz etc.   I ordered the daily special with the pretzel bun. Highly suggest getting anything with their pretzel bun and potato chips. Secondly, hope you practice your chess and corn hole because they have a life size chess board and two sets of corn hole spots. I am not good at either especially with some beer in me so I deff need practice the next time I go.   This place has a nice outdoor deck and is great for large groups! See you soon VBGB!",

I love going to VBGB in the Music Factory. Totally chill place. This is the kind of place that you can go and just hang out with friends, have a beer, play jenga or chess and spend a night. I've come here for a couple of my birthdays but have never really been concerned about having a group unless we were definitely getting dinner. You have to get here early if you want a bench table all to yourself. And, I don't care if you're hungry or not - get the pretzel and beer cheese. I'm not kidding. Does it look like I'm kidding? ORDER IT. If you're at VBGB as you read this review, stop reading, walk over to the food counter (Under the big \"EAT\" sign) and politely order your pretzel and beer cheese. (You could order a brat too, if you're really hungry).   I'll wait.   See? Don't you feel better? Now you can eat your pretzel, drink your beer and have a lovely night. Good luck in chess, I always play the huge chess board too. Love, Kel.",

A great beer selection at not quite overpriced prices is impossible to find anywhere else in this area.  Plenty of bar games, occasional live music, and a very chill crowd make this my go to spot.  Decent quick bites puts this place over the top.  This is for sure my go to spot before shows at the Fillmore or at the Amphitheater.  I've actually seen an amazing concert here.  They had Mike Dillon play here once, what a treat.  Every time I come here I see somebody I know.  Its not quite a cheers place where everybody knows your name, as it always seems to be a different crowd.  But, I'll take what I can get.  The beer selection is above and beyond most bars in Charlotte besides the big tap houses.  There's always a great selection of craft beers from around the state and nation.  With multiple size options of 12oz, 17oz or more, you can get exactly what you need.  I don't know if I would come here if not already going to a concert in the area, but it is where you can find me under those conditions, for sure.",

VBGB is an awesome place for a party, to meet up with friends, or just to swing by and have a beer or two. An outstanding selection of beer and in different glass or mug sizes as well, so very versatile. There is one large main bar that can also be accessed from outside via a drive-thru like window. There is also a small shack out back that I imagine may only open up in the evenings as a secondary drink location.  I have not had much opportunity to explore their food menu, but have had the Jumbo Gourmet Pretzel on a couple of occasions, and as far as pretzels go, it is to die for along with the provided beer cheese as well.   For entertainment they regularly have live music outside as well as all sorts of gaming options from cornhole to jumbo Connect-4, jumbo Chess, and three or four volleyball courts. Awesome atmosphere. Only problem is that the Music Factory is usually so busy that it can be a hassle to get over there, but I guess that is a good problem to have.",

I came here once for a company event and once with a friend on Saturday afternoon. This is the perfect place to grab a drink outside, especially during the summer months.   In addition to this being a great beer garden, I love the food and beer cheese. I definitely order either the pretzels with beer cheese or chips with beer cheese. Perfect food to eat with my drink.  One thing I suggest, do NOT come here with kids. It's a beer garden! Not a casual restaurant. Don't expect it to be a quiet restaurant.

However, whether you enjoy coming here or find yourself here to waste a little time before an event at The Fillmore (like myself), don't get any of the food.   We ordered the Totchos and a chicken slider to share. We grabbed ourselves some beers from the bar and sipped on them until our food arrived. In minutes our order was placed in front of us and the Totchos ( described on the menu as tots topped with house-made beer cheese, jalapenos, beans, corn, roasted peppers, fire sauce, and sour cream) looked nothing like what we had mentally pictured. Sure there was obviously some cheese sauce, jarred jalapenos and sour cream but saw like 5 black beans and a similar number of corn kernels. No idea what the fire sauce was supposed to be because there was no trace of that. $7.50 for some tots with an underwhelming cheese sauce on them and a glob of sour cream. Meh.  The chicken slider wasn't much better but it was at least a steal at $2. I do have to say that the chicken itself, while the size of a McNugget was crispy and juicy. Its a shame they decided to drench it in the same boring beer cheese sauce.  Perhaps there are better things on the menu and maybe if we had gone out back to play games the place would have seemed to have a little more ambience. My dude didn't understand why anyone would think of this spot as THE spot they wanted to come hang out and have a beer at but I did enjoy some of the tunes they played. The service was good but the food, we agreed was super bleh. We felt like it was a waste of money and it left us with a bit of a stomach ache.",

They usually carry a few of the staples from the local breweries but also have a nice variety of the lesser known brews as well.   I've been here a few times now and have played corn hole, jenga, and connect four. Really fun - especially while having a few beers.  I've still yet to try the chess board and volleyball courts. All games are life sized and easy to play even if you're a newbie.   The food is surprisingly good.  Our table ordered a bunch of food to share and it was all really good.  We ordered the black bean burger, sweet potato fries, chips and salsa, pretzel, Italian sausage, edamame, and potato latkes.  My favorite was probably the black bean burger and the potato latke's. The black bean burger comes on a pretzel bun and is one of the most flavorful veggie burgers I've had. The latkes were surprisingly good and are made with potatoes, onions, and chives. They are fried and come out in the shape of potato chips.   A really great concept for those looking for more than just a bar atmosphere.  I would definitely recommend a visit for anyone looking to have a good time with friends.",

I was told i could not get them well done?  never heard that before.  overall, a great place to grab a cold beer and bite eat before a show at the music factory.  charlotte needs more places like this!",

The beer selection is fun, the bartenders are super-knowledgeable and nice, and who doesn't like to drink giant quantities of beer out of big 'ol glass steins? However, the NC Music Factory is at the end of the earth (mine anyway) and VBGB is huge compared to the number of people that were there.  I think it would take quite a large crowd to fill that place, and so it seems a bit empty.  As for the food, the pretzels and beer cheese dip are to die for. The onion rings are great too. Everything else we had is standard \"bar food.\"   I hope the new shuttle from South Blvd brings more people to this joint.  More energy is definitely needed!",

It feels like you are at a backyard cookout.  Giant jenga blocks ( seriously 2x4's), giant chess, cornhole all over the place, and three ping pong tables. At first I was like they just took someone's back yard and put a bar with a window next to it.  After playing a few games, I realized this wasn't such a bad thing.  Its a great place to go especially during the afternoon.",

It is technically within uptown as it lies within 277 but it would be a stretch to say it's walkable from most parts of uptown.  The location away from everything else in uptown is it's biggest drawback, but it means lots of free parking if you're driving.    Whoever designed this place nailed it, it's perfect.  The lighting, the benches, the bar, the signage, and the huge patio are exactly what I like to see in a beer garden.  Beer selection is excellent with some rotation.  VBGB also carries local breweries like NoDa and Old Mecklenburg.  VBGB has the best bar service I've seen in Charlotte.  They are happy to provide recommendations on beer and they cater to both those familiar with craft beer and those who are not without talking down to anyone.  Food from the kitchen is good but is a little pricey unless you catch something on the 4-3-2-1 specials.  The brawts are tasty and they have some electic items such as quinoa salad and edamame.  By far the best item on the menu is the pretzel with beer cheese, it's AMAZING.",

It can be intimidating to me to walk to a bartender and try and order something new especially in this setting.

The beer was stellar and ice cold as promised. I enjoyed a beautiful stein full of Bitburger. They also have an awesome ice beer rail which I've never seen before and I'm sure will catch on quick.   Really knowledgeable bartenders and great service.   PRETZEL AND BEER CHEESE! Incredible. the Wings are a must have as well, so tasty. The people I was with raved about the brats/dogs they had which came with pretzel buns (great idea).   I agree with the previous review that it was a little empty but I have to assume that is a result of the place only being open for a few weeks (if that) because this place is great.

The food is really quite good and reasonably priced.  You order food from a walk-up counter, and then it is brought to your table.  And our food arrived amazingly fast which was great since we had kids with us.  It's a little rough around the edges (some of the picnic tables are sagging, games are getting worn out, etc.) but overall a fun place with great food.  We ordered the caprese salad skewers, quinoa salad, burger, sausage sandwich, pretzel, pulled chicken sandwich, chips and corn salad, chicken bites, etc.  Basically, we ordered the entire menu and it was delicious.  They have limited selection on non-alcholic drinks (no iced tea, or lemonade, etc.) and they should serve some sort of plates with the food as it is usually shared among more than one person.  Other than that, GREAT place!",

This is really a simple place and if you're looking for some place pretentious, this is NOT the place.  Come in jeans or shorts and you'd fit in just fine.     Inside, there are several long picnic tables.  and a custom bar with a few high bench seats which was pretty cool.  You go up to the middle of the bar and order.  They have several different beer selections and the beer changes frequently so the taps have handwritten labels.  There is a beer menu on the back wall.  I was sampling all the IPAs last night and they were all very tasty.  Note:  This is not a place that sells mainstream beers so if you're looking for Bud or Miller lite, you might want to go elsewhere.   Ordering food is done at another counter.  You place your order and they can link it in with your bar tab.  The soft pretzel is absolutely amazing.  Very soft although a bit salty.  I didn't really care for the beer cheese but at that point, i was well into my 5th beer.  Just grab some mustard for my pretzel and I'm fine!.  I also had the sausage sandwich in the pretzel roll and the german potato salad.   The sauerkraut and onions on the sandwhich were tasty.  The place also has a great patio and for our group it was a place where you could talk when the inside got a little loud.  The patio has several tables and a few adult games:  ping pong, cornhole and a big chess board.    I would definitely come back here just to check out the latest beer selections!",

After (or during, I don't judge) your games, you can cool down with some nice craft beers and a delicious black bean (or beef) burger. Or nachos. I love the nachos here. They're smothered in beer cheese, black bean and corn salsa, and fried jalapenos - drool. Anything on a pretzel roll is gonna be bomb too. And, of course, a good ol' pretzel with beer cheese.   They've got a big out door area with your usual cornhole, giant jenga, giant connect 4, and a ping pong table. A stage area for some sweet live tunes. A supplemental outdoor bar that's connected to the main bar inside for convenient beverages. A built in ice bar to keep your drinks chilled. And lots and lots of beer on tap.

The food is fantastic, you have access to the outdoor area, TV in the room, and a PRIVATE bathroom.  They do a fantastic job if you are looking for a turn key option....an of course the beer list can't be beat.  Ask for Alyssa to help you plan...she's awesome!",

I always take out of town guest here because I'm a fan of the Music Factory area. They can get very busy before a show at the Uptown Amp or The Fillmore. I believe they do volleyball tournamenta too because they have many courts. It's truly a summertime dream bar!",

I'm asked all the time \"Where should I go to have a few beers with a few friends?\" and I always suggest this place, sure, breweries are fun but once you've been to one, lets face it, you've pretty much been to all.   This is a garden bar so the atmosphere is playful and fun with great music, an adult playground if you will. Picnic tables for seating and games, yes games! Board games, card games, BIG Jenga, corn hole, life size connect four, and life size chess, just to name a few. They even have a beach volley ball court, sand and all!  Before deciding on a game you might as well head over to the full bar, where you'll find drink specials and their extensive beer menu that is always up to date with the local and seasonal brews. There's something for every palette. Next, head over to the \"EAT\" counter, I know I know, GAMES, BEER, AND FOOD?! My thoughts exactly. It is not your average bar food selection either. The pretzel is a must, two words...BEER CHEESE, you're welcome. I love their chicken bites which you can get tossed in the sauce of your choice. I prefer their signature sauce, Wango Tango, a little spicy, a little sweet, a little tangy. I also go for their black bean burger, you don't have to be a vegetarian to enjoy this burger because its DA BOMB! Pulled chicken sandwiches, sausage dogs, nachos, salads, onion rings, they have it all! My personal favorite are the fried pickles. There was a time I would only crave VBGB's fried pickles. Yes, its that serious.   VBGB never disappoints and I hope you make your way over to this gem  any time of the year, when its cold they enclose their patio area so the fun never stops! No excuses! Get your butt over there now!",

They provide many different kinda of board games (Apples to Apples, Sorry, Cranium, etc.), jumbo Jenga, a huge connect four, cornhole, and life size chess! The music selection was also to my liking- a lot of R&B. For those who enjoy dancing, they have that too. They pretty much cater to all your weekend needs. I can't wait to come back!",

Which was pretty rad, so for anyone looking for a more laid back large group lunch/dinner - perhaps you want to consider VBGB?    The sad news, for me at least, is that there isn't much in terms if vegan food options.  However, the quinoa salad is in fact terrific (and I'm fine with consuming my calories in fermented liquid format, thank you very much).  Even if the quinoa wasn't the only item I could eat, I'm confident I would have still inhaled five cups (approximately?  sure felt like it afterwards, whoah) of the stuff.  Thankfully everyone else was busy stuffing their faces with pretzels and beer cheese, sliders, etc., so no one really missed the quinoa . . .   The secluded side room (complete with a one-person restroom!) and patio are was reserved for us, but as the festivities ended, a dozen of us wandered into the large patio area chockfull of game such as Connect Four, cornhole, ping pong etc.  There was a laptop DJ as well and quite a large crowd.    The beers, they are impressive.  But there's also wine for those of us who try to abstain from beer.  I had a few whiskey sours that night as well as they were the \"themed drink\" named after the now wedded couple's dog.  I'm sure whatever you have a hankering for - VBGB has it.",

We ordered the Crispin cider (which was a little over priced IMO), and the pretzel with beer cheese. The food is amazing. After even looking at our pretzel, there were other people in our party that ordered one. It was awesome! Can I please have that cheese in a cup to take home? I want to dip it with everything!   We also had some wings and some sweet potato fries. I thought the fries were very good, but my husband fell in love with their honey mustard dipping sauce that comes with it.   All in all we had a great time here. There was more than enough parking just across the street, we had good drinks, excellent food, and plenty to keep us entertained. A must go for people that have never been!  **Just a side note, they used to be open every day but Mondays, but have recently decided to be open on Mondays too, another day to have fun!",

Bartender offered me a free beer for looking thirsty, so he got extra brownie points from the start. I am not a beer connoisseur by no means, in fact usually do not care for other flavors beside my Miller lite and New Castle. I really enjoyed the taste of this free beer that was handed to me. I was actually impressed.   They support all of Charlotte's local breweries and craft beers as well as around the world. And trust me, if they can hand me a craft beer and I like it, there is something for everyone. They have a huge, tented patio for year round cover, while being able to enjoy the outside. The night I was there they had a volley ball tournament going on. Me personally I am not going to a bar to participate in a full fledge volley ball tournament but the fact this place can host something like that is cool. I also saw corn hole and table tennis. Not sure how corn hole got so huge, but hey it's popular and they have it.   Too bad I was not able to taste some of the food, that will be next time. Looking at the menu, prices are pretty reasonable and affordable.  I would come here again. The service was great and the place was comfortable. Cant wait to try lunch or dinner soon.",

I didn't eat but they also have German food if you're hungry.   The garden comes alive with a nice outdoor patio with ping pong, plenty of seating, and a tent.

I love taking out of towners here just cause it's chill and fun. My husband's Yelp rating system is, for 5 stars, it is somewhere you take out of towners to impress them and show off our city. So, 5 stars it is for VBGB.   Their beer selection is phenomenal. So many local beers. Plus, they always have Red Oak on tap, which is winning in my book! On Tuesdays, all pints are $3. Beer sizes are 12 oz, 17 oz, and 22 oz (which is this awesome huge looking mug). Came here this past Wednesday and got the 17 oz of Red Oak deliciousness (I'm not obsessed, I promised).  Now on to the food. VBGBs food is amazing, not just for bar standards but for life standards. The pretzel in beer cheese is definitely the best I have had in Charlotte. Their nachos with black bean patty crumbles are to die for. They also have really amazing salads. On my most recent trip, my friend got the burger and said it was very good. Typically there is food specials every day, so check those out on the side board cause I have had some great eats from the specials!   Perks of this place are 1. The ice railing going all around the bar to keep your drink cold. and 2. The outdoor patio. Heck, you can even order from the outdoor patio and not even have to go inside! There are so many awesome games to play. Corn hole, giant jenga, giant connect four, ping pong, board games, etc.   Go check this place out asap!",

It was quite dead when we arrived and I guess we looked as if we didn't belong there because you could have cut the tension with a knife. No, Cheers bar style, \"Welcome\" just dead stares from the bar area. The staff at the food order station was very pleasant and hospitable. We ordered and headed to the bar with our order number flag. The bartender said their lines were frozen on all the ciders so that put a damper on my daughter's drink order. She's not much on beer! I, on the other hand, am a craft beer aficionado! I love craft beer, not all but I do love trying out new beers on flights, as well as trying different flavors of my favorite styles of craft beers such as, Wits and IPAs. With that being said, I tried (if you call 34oz try) Sycamore Blush Wit and I absolutely loved it! This Wit presented in a pretty pink hue and the flavor had a citrusy grapefruit tone. It was delicious and I have sought out the maker so I can drink it more often. Please understand VGBG is not a brewery, it is a bar that has event rooms for rent and a patio and lawn area with games. The food here is pretty good! I ordered the Breakfast Sammie and my daughter ordered the Totchos with the Beer cheese, jalapenos and the Fire Sauce only. The totchos were good but I would have gotten them loaded the way the menu presents but my daughter is a picky eater! My Sammie was awesome! This jewel has a fried egg, bacon, tomato and cheddar cheese layered and melted on a pretzel bun. All I can say is YUMMY! We ordered a pretzel and fries to go! The same food staff brought the to go order to us when it was ready and was still just as pleasant! I wish VGBG sold growlers but again this is not a brewery. I may give it another try next summer to see if the atmosphere is any more welcoming. A quick shoutout \"Welcome\" goes a long way!",

True to form boyfriend and I were starving at 9pm on a Friday and were not looking for fancy. Ended up at VBGB and I am sure glad we did. They already had the music going so it was a little loud for conversation, but we ordered some grub and sat at the bar. They have a great beer selection, obviously. We were able to get a 2016 and 2017 sexual chocolate and compare, which was cool. The bar setup is ideal because its huge but set up in islands so its easy for the bartender to get to you. Its also got an ice covered rail to set your beer on so it will stay cool. Maybe I don't get out much, but never seen this before!   We ordered the boss wings, totchos (how could you not) and a last minute impulse decision of a turkey slider each because they were $2.   Curveball. The turkey slider with cheese and mustard was the best thing. So good. Totchos and wings were also great. We way overordered and couldn't finish everything.   Can't wait to come back in the summer and enjoy the patio! Its the perfect spot for when you halfway wanna go out but don't really want to get ready.",

I ordered the tatchos but skipped out on a few of the toppings which left me with cheese, jalapenos and the fire sauce. The totchos were okay, but nothing worth writing home about. I was hoping to try out a draft cider but sadly all the cider taps were out because the lines had frozen, so I ordered a Long Island instead, which tasted as expected. I may have to visit again in the summer to get the full experience of everything they have to offer.",

Several, and I mean several, beers on tap to choose from and I'm pretty sure they'll have something you will like! If you show up with an empty belly, that is not a problem! VBGB is prepared to handle your hunger with a variety of delicious eats! Just walk up to the window to place your order - they'll track you down based on the numeric flag they assign you. The food comes out in the casual paper boats .. nothing fancy about this place... I like it!  Grab a seat and the bar to chill and chat! Speaking of chilling - don't forget to place your mug on the ice shelf directly in front of you! What a nifty idea. No seat at the bar? Don't worry. There is more than enough space inside and out on the covered patio - which also has window access to order more brews! That's important, gotta keep 'em flowing.  It's a great place to hang out for several hours, or just to grab some pre-concert drinks!",

Parking is now super easy thanks to the new deck, but there are always a huge number of taxis and ubers that like to hover around the area. The drink menu is always changing, but always unique and impressive, and the food is honestly not that bad. Don't miss the pretzel bites with beer cheese. I'm a sucker for anything soft pretzel related and these are no exception. VGBG works well for either a pre-game place for a concert, or coming here just for VGBG itself. There are tons of volleyball courts, pong tables, sometimes live music, sometimes trivia (some of the most unique trivia I've played in the city), but always a good time.  Pro-tip: Don't come here expecting to hear the concert next door. They've perfected the art of blasting music inwards haha.",

The beer selection is amazing, and I love all the different sizes they have. Good liquor choices too! I had a Christmas cookie shot last night that was to die for.   The food is absolutely delicious. Best bar food ever. I have had A LOT of pretzels and beer cheese, but hands down this is the best. I've taken all of my out of town friends and they agree. They even have unexpected things like black bean burgers. They serve late which is a huge plus in my book.   Lastly, the atmosphere is great. They always have talented DJs on the weekends that perfectly blend old and new songs. The music makes the experience even better. Their outdoor patio and games are great year round! A MUST SEE in Charlotte.",

They have a wide beer selection (with lots of local options) and also serve liquor (but have no drink menu, to my knowledge). There are also many snack and meal options with their famous tot-chos and beyond. Definitely not the place to go to be healthy, but that's neither here nor there. There is TONS of outdoor seating. I believe you can reserve a picnic table ahead of time for an event if desired. There are also sand volleyball courts which get quite a lot of action and which make for fun entertainment while you sit and watch.",

    "text": "Definitely an UNIQUE experience.  Wife and I had a great time spending our evening here watching people playing volley ball and sipping some great beers and munching some tasty apps.   VBGB is not a brewery but it definitely has the vibe of one.  Huge outdoor seating, lots of seating space inside, bar on the main side and a counter to order food at another corner.  Bartenders were really attentive and responsive.  after ordering our flights and food, we wanted to check how the outside was and boom, now that's why there is so much craze for this place.  Its a party outside!  Huge seating area, lots of games to play, numerous volley ball courts and that night we went seems to be some kind of trivia night.  Sometimes when we looked around it felt like a get-together or sorts coz people talking to other people, so friendly, petting dogs, have a fun time.  Definitely a great place to hang out with friends and make new ones. The food was great as well, we ordered some chicken kabobs and tots, both were delicious.  Beers are your regular branded and local beers and we went with some local brews like Noda, Triple C, etc.,  nothing to complain about beers of course. Its the vibe, outdoor seating and multiple volley ball courts is what sets this place apart from many pubs/beer halls in the charlotte area.  Parking is a challenge since it in the music factory complex and you get to park in the lot across the street and its a minute walk to VBGB. Loved our visit and love to go again!",

If you come here and can't find something you enjoy, well the problem is you my friend. VBGB has a more than impressive beer selection (including a ton of local brews), great bar food, killer patio, and #allthegames. It's the perfect spot to grab drinks and eats before or after a show at the Amphitheatre/Fillmore/FountainPlaza/Comedy Zone.   Don't like beer? They have a full bar. Don't enjoy bar food? Get a salad. First time ordering food here? You have to go to the kitchen window. Don't go to the bar. Every time I'm here i see someone make that mistake. They now serve lunch on Fridays. I tend to order too much food here. I'm not sure why I feel like I need a pretzel, dog or brat of some sort, and wings.  The beer cheese is delicious.  The patio is massive and loaded picnic tables. You can even reserve a table. It's tented during the cool months. There's a window to order drinks so you don't have to go inside. A ton of things to do- sand volleyball courts, cornhole, oversized games. I always want to play giant chess, but I have no idea how to play chess.   Parking is free. Heads up, you may have to park pretty deep in the lot on concert nights. Also, expect an Uber surge if you try to leave when one of these events end. Plan accordingly.",

    "text": "Wow! Such a cool, unique spot! At first we thought it was just a bar that also had a kitchen. It was very packed because there was a show at the neighboring uptown amphitheater. You walk in and there's long banquet-style picnic tables to eat and drink at, so it's very communal. Plenty of space to find seating. We got the chicken bratwurst and tater tots with fire sauce. The bratwurst wasn't the greatest but that's most likely because it was chicken... so can't really blame VBGB.. But the tots were delicious. Loved the dipping sauce they came with. Not that spicy, but still flavorful.  Only after we finished eating did we realize they have a HUGE outdoor seating area in the back, complete with about 4-6 sand volleyball courts! Music was pumping through the stereos throughout, everyone's having a good time playing volleyball or the giant jenga and giant connect four, corn hole, and of course an outdoor bar too. It was so cool! I'm so jealous that we don't have anything even close to the vgbg concept in raleigh! This place was packed in a good way. Definitely a fun hangout spot to play, drink, talk, eat, whatever!",

It's like that pretty girl you see on the subway - you keep hoping and waiting to see her again. A hole in the wall? Maybe.  A dive bar? Not really. A super chill place to meet your friends for great Craft Beer and freakin' awesome eats? Yes, that's more like it.  The atmosphere is so cool it hangs like a cloud. Love the communal tables. Love the draft selection. Love how the restaurant side is like a separate/self-serve type. Beer Cheese Nachos are great any time of day - I would eat them for breakfast. You can really taste the beer in that wonderful pool of nacho cheese at the bottom of the basket. Oh yeah! The chicken skewers were cooked to order - the chicken was ridiculously tender, juicy and flavorful! The person next to me had a giant gourmet pretzel glistening with butter - if she ever got up to go to the bathroom; I had a master plan to eat it!  If your abs are ripped and you like to sweat there's a volleyball court. If you like the outdoors, there's a patio section.   This place has it all. The only thing missing is me, and chances are I'll be there later!",

This is my favorite bar. There, I've said it.  I have a lot of respect for the owners because they value the importance of a good product, and throw away marketing bs.  You won't see a single neon sign, posters, or crazy looking tap handles.  It's all about the beer.  That's it.  And VBGB's has a great selection, and it constantly changes.    I love how every single bartender there knows their beer.  Don't know what you want?  They can help you figure out if you're an IPA kinda drinker, or maybe a lighter hefe style brew.  Again, it's all about the beer.  The food is surprisingly good as well.  It's a small menu of freshly made \"bar\" food.  The brats and the pretzels are delicious.    My favorite thing about this place?  You won't be able to find a Miller Light or a Bud Light to save your life.  I've seen people walk in, ask for that type of beer, and literally walk out.  As long as this place stays with that policy, I will continue to loyally support them.",

I usually don't drive out to the Music Factory just to come here, but I am ALWAYS pre-gaming at this place before a show at the Fillmore or the amphitheater.  I get just as excited about coming here as I do about the actual concerts themselves....That's saying something!  I can always count on VBGB offering up a beer on tap that I've never tried before.  It's always such an adventure!  It's all craft beer here folks.  The food is very basic, but I like that.  I'm not looking for an expensive meal when I'm trying to get my drink on, just something to keep me going.  If you try anything at all, go with the pretzel & beer cheese.  It's terrific.  A great munchie to keep you grounded after all those high gravity brews!",

I think I paid an average of $6.00 per 12 oz pour.  17 oz pours averaged in around $7.50. Good draft selection and the atmosphere isn't bad. Again, nothing special. The food prices are reasonable and the fried fare we tried was good. The bar staff was nice, knowledgeable, and helpful. I just can't get over the beer prices.",

Decent place to meet friends for a beer after work, but make sure you don't come hungry.",

The thing that I fell in love with was the fact that they have either 32 or 34 oz glasses for their beer.  I can't remember exactly which.  They have games outside and plenty of space.  They also have a nice selection of beer so there is definitely something for everyone.",

To me anything that's not \"Bud,\" \"Miller\" or  \"Michelob\" are just confusing... yes, gasp, you can yell at me later :)  But on a Tuesday $2 draft night, I'm more than happy to try that stuff... stuff I cannot pronounce, because apparently I like foreign wheat beer.  The bartenders (or beer consultants) also told me to stay away from IPA or anything that has the word pale in front of ale.  Hey, I'll listen to the experts.  So far so good.  They were even nice enough to keep letting me taste different stuffs and eventually mixed 2 together so they could get rid of me for the next 15 minutes.    It's just a nice, causal setting where you can just hang out at the picnic table (if you have a big group) or at the bar (completed with a little strip of icy area for the beer) and talk with your friends.  Yes, we can talk and hear each other!  They even offer games like Jenga and ping pong for a friendly game of rivalry.    They have a small kitchen area with small bites that are decently priced.  I tried the chicken nuggets which were ok as well as the pretzel... which was a little expensive for a pretzel but was nice and warm and did its job soaking up my beer.",

I didn't pay for any of them, even more awesome thanks wonderful drinking buddies!  I'm going to list the beers I liked here, mostly so I can remember them for future purchases. My favorite of the night was a Lost Coast tangerine wheat ale that was deliciously citrusy! Second place goes to the Orange Blossome extra pale ale. Beers 3-5 were also very good but I cannot seem to have remembered anything by that point! Outside they have extra cool games and activities on the patio, oh yeah!  As I was leaving for a late dinner I happened to spot the ice rail. What an ingenious idea to have a cooled platform to keep your beer glass cold! I shall be back next Tuesday and maybe even the Tuesday after that! Yeah that's right be ready to put up with me now that you've gotten me hooked.",

Pretzel was top notch - chewy on the inside, crusty on the outside, and the stone ground mustard dip made a nice pairing.  Fried pickles had a nice Cajun edge to them that worked well with the sharpness of the pickle and the smoothness of the ranch.  Obviously a great selection of beer, nicely categorized with several local choices.  Unless you get once of the specials, you're paying a little premium for the cool atmosphere.  All in all, a solid place to hang if you're in the uptown area.",

I love the indoor-outdoor feel and suspect this would be awesome in the summer. Good selection of bar food. Also, bathrooms were clean!  Minus one star for the jerk bartenders, though.

The food is pretty good too.  The pretzel and beer cheese was right up my alley.  My only disappointment is that I came on a Friday night after a concert at the Fillmore and the place was less than half full.  I can't figure out why because it seems to have all the makings of a great hangout spot.

While I have seen bars that offer games and entertainment of this sort before, they are always located in some terrible, six-square-foot arena of sadness; VGBG has the amazing advantage of offering ample space both indoors and out. My only recommendation would be to add heat lamps. And offer me sacks of money when I walk through the door.",

This place is exactly what Charlotte needed, and sits nestled directly in the heart of the Charlotte Music Factory. It's kind of a no-frills atmosphere, where everything is counter service; I think it works well, because whether you're indoors or out, there is always an opening to order a beer.   Also, I think at this point in our city's maturity, unless you have a solid patio/rooftop/outdoor area, you're not quite as cool as everyone else...and wow, does VBGB have an excellent patio. Drinking games abound--ping pong, jenga, cornhole, you name it, they've got it.   This place is also perrrrrrfect for the pre-show beer if you're going to either the Fillmore or the TW Amphitheater. A quick stop in for a Birdsong Higher Ground IPA, NoDa 10 Blocks South, or whatever local beer they've got on tap that night, and you'll get right in the groove prior to the show.

While I was off over here thinking you were some college idiot infested bar, you're just hanging out at the NC Music Factory with your ample free parking, beautiful pitchers of beer, lots of taps, in a variety of beer styles, being a chill and relaxed destination right outside of Uptown. I'm sorry I assumed some things about you that weren't True - and you know assuming gets ya - it makes an ASS out of ME (and not really U).  But seriously, your outdoor patio with adult Jenga and cornhole was really fun! The indoor/outdoor convenience of ordering, the long picnic tables that encourages people to talk to their neighbors/old friends/new friends and the DJ's on Saturday night was all really enjoyable. I didn't eat any of your food, but next time! We are definitely planning on coming back and hanging out with you soon - perhaps for another birthday party, maybe for a fun date, or a girl's night. No matter the occasion, I think you'd fit the bill pretty well!  Thanks again for the fun night and good beers - may I never judge another nightlife establishment before testing it out again!

Yes, I understand you're trying to cater to families. And yes, I appreciate that you have your own children and this is your dream, yada yada. But I ask you - who tends to buy more, spend more overall money, at a bar/restaurant? Families, who milk a beer or two and chicken fingers for the kids? Or a groups of 30-somethings who are there because they love beer?   In striving to create a place that welcomes families who don't want to hire a babysitter for some reason, it has become a place where children are encouraged to run around and bother other guests seated at nearby tables. And when I commented on this to one of the bartenders, I was scolded for complaining. \"This is a family spot\" I was told. Really? Since when is being a family spot mean that there are zero rules or accountability about keeping one's children reined in?  The truth is, we're less inclined to go there on Saturday afternoons now, and that's really too bad. Yet another great joint ruined by parents unwilling to, you know, parent their unruly children. And I'm not alone in this opinion - I've heard it said by others as I have gone around town.   Better watch out -- that's the sort of bad word of mouth that can wreck a place.",

The beer selection is awesome, they have a large number of craft beers beers on tap and are constantly changing.  On top of the great beer selection there is a ton of this to do.. On the back patio they have ping-pong, corn hole, chess, connect four, and much more!! On top of all the fun activities and great beer, parking is never a problem as there is a giant parking lot across the street, and i have never had to pay a cover mo matter the day of the week!",

    "text": "We rarely venture far out of the Lake Norman area, but a Groupon to a beer hall in the northern section of Charlotte was just too tempting to pass up. We headed out on a rainy Saturday, which is probably not the best weather to go in, but our Groupon was on the verge of expiring so it was now or never. Despite the ill weather we still had a great time at this beer hall.  My first piece of advice regards parking...do not follow your GPS and attempt to park in the area around the building as it will undoubtedly be full and will be a pain to get out of. Instead park in the huge lot right across the street and then just walk over.  Once you enter VBGB you will be surrounding by a few things...long beer hall-esque tables, loud music, and loads of people. It's a fun place to go for a beer with buds, and everyone else seems to be of like mind since the place was packed already when we went at 5pm.    So the main point of attraction at VGBG is the beer. They offer about thirty or so taps and sell them in a variety of ounces. Most of the beers are craft and either local to NC or from other states. There's a little bit of everything and even the most picky beer drinker should be able to find something on draft to chug down. The bartenders were pretty quick, though the first one we spoke with could have been a bit more knowledgeable about the beer list. We started off with a 12oz for each of us then grabbed some appetizers and a seat.  The kitchen is pretty convenient as you just walk up to a window, place your order, and then sit back and wait for them to deliver the food to you. We started with the fried pickles and potato latkes. I'm not a huge fan of pickles, but I would definitely eat these again. The fried outside really helps die down a little of the bitterness of the pickle and also gives it more crunch/ texture  than it would get on it's own...both good things in my book. The latkes were pretty decent, though a bit too flimsy for me. The shredded potato cakes were fresh from the fryer and had a great taste, especially when dolloped with sour cream. But they were flaky and fell apart easily, leaving some crumbs to fall to waste. I would have preferred a firmer potato cake but the taste was spot on.  After we polished off our first beers, apps and a few rounds of Connect Four (there are a few boardgames that you can bring over to your table) we were ready to move on to the main course. I grabbed a flight of beers (four 5oz glasses) so that we could each try two more beers without committing to two more full glasses. Unfortunately the bar ran out of flight glasses and the tray so I was forced to carry back four soda glasses back to our table. Not only was it a pain for me to carry four glasses without a tray, but by the time I got back and settled the beers were all out of order, so the miss' and I ended up playing an impromtu game of Guess Who.   For dinner I ordered the pork brat with sour kraut and the miss' ordered the chicken brat with peppers and onions, both on a pretzel bun. First off, the pretzel bun puts any other bun to shame. That thick, slightly hard exterior that yielded to a soft interior was far superior to any other hot dog/ brat/ sausage vessel you can find. The pork brat with sour kraut was the perfect combination, and the brat was extremely juicy and had that slight snap to it. The chicken brat was equally as good, and with the peppers and onions it gave it a great overall flavor. I personally preferred the pork to the chicken, but both were still pretty damn good.  There is an outdoor patio area but we didn't venture out there due to the stormy weather. Overall VGBG's seems like a fun place to sit back and take a load off. A decent selection of beers, some great \"beer food\", games, live music and more make for a great hangout spot. My biggest criticism is that a lot of people agree, and the place can be a bit too packed for my taste (I all about personal space.) We will definitely be back in the future next time we want to take a few hours out of the day to hang out with good food and great drink.",

    "text": "This is perhaps the perfect beer pub in the CLT. Whether you're here on a Saturday night enjoying a well-spun DJ mix indoors, or taking advantage of a crisp late spring night outdoors while watching folks enjoy several games of cornhole and a giant-sized chess board that would make the White Queen want to jump in and play. I love this place, and i'll go whenever I get the opportunity.  Lots of local microbrews on tap - NoDa, OMB and Natty Brown, just to name a few - and segregated by type, but if you have a hard time figuring out what you want, especially if you're used to more mass-produced swill (I'm looking at you, Bud drinkers), one of the friendly and knowledgable barkeeps will ask the right questions and pour you a cold pint that you won't be disappointed with. I wish I could remember the name of the one barkeep I like, but if you see a bartender with a chrome-domed head and a set of wilderness-crazy mutton chops so awesome it would make Wolverine go all berserker-rage with envy, he's the guy you want pouring you a brew. The man is a Sherpa of beer-laden deliciousness.   But the biggest draw for me is the food. If you want stale wings smothered in salty BBQ sauce, go look elsewhere. The black bean burger is the 2nd-best in town - sorry, but the Herban Legend's BBB kicks ass - but you can't leave a night at VBGB without enjoying a fresh-baked giant pretzel. Look, I'm from NYC, and the pretzel is about as ubiquitous there as an out-of-control yellow cab and tourists gawking at all the pretty lights in Times Square, but I had my feel of those doughy-assed twists of high-carb crap, so if you're gonna make me eat a pretzel, knock me on my ass.   The pretzels don't knock me on my ass. They give me the proverbial foodie boner that can't be made to calm the hell down with a cold shower. Oh, and dip 'em in beer cheese, and...yeah, go crazy.  It doesn't feel like an authentic German beer hall, but, hey, if you want authentic, buy your authenticity-seeking ass a plane ticket to Munich during Oktoberfest and get your damned fill, ya fuckin' snob. I don't care. I don't care if this is a Polish or Czech or Bolivian or Trafalgarmorian beer hall; the beer's awesome, the food even better, the atmosphere perfect and devoid of the kind of douchery that some of the trendy drinking spots on Tryon are infested with.   Just go already, dammit. Have a pretzel, enjoy a NoDa, and play some cornhole, and have a nice time.",

They have a beer on tap for everyone and their food is basically, food truck food. Good news it's not bad; but, I would love to see more vegetables!   Basic Burger with beer cheese- the bun was bigger than the hamburger and we split the burger.  I got the smaller half.  I was mad; because, it was a good burger.   Beer cheese nachos- with Jalapenos and sour cream too. Next time no sour cream. I'm not a fan of sour cream, so someone needs to remind me.   It's always a fun time with or without the kids at VBGB!

Nice selection of beers, plenty of IPAs and ales. They let you sample them before you buy it, so that's pretty nice!   Atmosphere was chill and fun! Lots of board games, giant Jenga, giant connect four and cornhole. We sat on the terrace, which they closed in with a tent, and it was popping!   Definitely coming back here!

Con: The drink selection was just OK, but at least the prices were a-ok to match.    Con: The bartender steered me away from a drink (said it was sour like a grapefruit) that I ended up ordering later--it was delicious and sweet like a sangria cider.  Con: It was shockingly cold _inside_ the location.  I can't imagine what it was like in the beer garden area which was really just an enclosed tent (but man did it look cool!).  Pros: Latkes.  Yes.  They have latkes.  With sour cream, but no apple sauce.  And they let me customize my nacho order as I was being difficult about the sauces and jalapenos.    Con: It took much longer for the food to arrive than you would think considering nachos don't need cooking.  Seriously.    Pro: Location was close to our next event which is pretty much why we chose VBGB in the first place.  Location and latkes.    Would I go again?  Yeah.  If I was already going to be in the area and wanted to eat not-Mexican food or if a group insisted.  But I certainly wouldn't go in and of itself unless it was peak beer gardening weather.",

Drinks are relatively inexpensive.  It was just over $35 for two mixed drinks, two beers, and two food items.  The grilled cheese was very good.  The bacon was a bit rubbery and I was expecting it to be on the crispy side.  The pretzel bun was soft, salty, but didn't resemble a pretzel except in its look.  The wedge salad was fantastic.  There was plenty of blue cheese dressing and it was fantastic!  I would return if invited by others, but I can't see myself visiting alone.",

The boneless wings, loaded tater tots, and pretzel with beer cheese are the perfect choices to soak up a little alcohol in your belly after a long afternoon or evening of drinking. Queen City Brew Fest, Oktoberfest, Cookies & Crafts -- I'm looking at you! Their beer selection is usually pretty good, too. There's always good choices for me and my IPA loving husband. On occasion, I've had a beer that tastes a little funky. I question the cleanliness of their beer lines.   Lots of seating to hang out at a picnic table or sidle up to the bar, inside and out. While I've never taken advantage of their sand volleyball courts, they do look fun. During big games, they usually set up a projector and big screen. So, a good spot to root on the home team. And, they validate parking in the deck (if you happen to land there instead of one of the free, surface lots) now that greedy ol' AvidXchage is charging $5 to park in \"their\" Music Factoy.

My friend has a 4 year old daughter so we wanted to go somewhere with drinks, but appropriate for kids so my friend suggested we go here. I live in Raleigh, but visit Charlotte a lot.   We had brunch right before coming so we were not hungry and didn't try any of the food, but there is a food station for you to order various bar-bites at the front of the bar when you come in. I actually hate I was full because the food looked and smelled great! We went to the bar and ordered mimosas and a beer. Unfortunately I'm not a beer drinker so I didn't order any beers, but they do have what looks like some great options. I personally don't care for Tropicana orange juice which is what they use for the mimosas so I didn't really like my mimosa. Also they poured a bit too much orange juice in it for my liking, but my friend ordered a second one and asked for less juice and it was much better. They also had a special that day for a Shamrock Mule, which was just a Moscow Mule with green liquer for color. It was not good, but I drunk it because I paid for it. I love Moscow Mules, but since this is a beer garden and there probably aren't a lot of people who order liquor based drinks coming here I don't think they have all of the proper ingredients or training to make certain drinks. It's not a huge issue that makes me want to never come back, I just know to keep my drink orders simple when I return.   There's a huge outside area with sand volleyball courts and large-sized games for all ages. This is definitely a great place for all areas. There's also a tented area as well. There's plenty of seating and space and there's a window to the bar from the outside so you don't have to go back inside for more drinks.  I will definitely return! And suggest this for anybody and everybody.",

    "text": "Had an opportunity to go to VBGB recently on a Saturday afternoon, and I have to say, VBGB never ceases to impress....  They've still got an exceptional selection of beers, and the bartenders are very willing to let you sample any of them.  They even have beers from a new local brewery in Charlotte - Resident Culture ( <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.residentculture.com&s=ac170ef120238390a90ff6d542b4e690f8d5514dd2b97a601bbe264189ee7d58\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">residentculture.com</a> ).  VBGB's the only place I've seen Resident Culture brews on tap!    But its really the food that convinced me to update my previous review.  First, the menu has really expanded from what I remember from the early years of VBGB, when the brats were the claim to fame.    Second, the 6 charred grilled chicken wings were so good, after I took my first bite, I had to stop, sit back, hold the wing up, and shake my head as I admired it - that f*ck!ng good!  I really don't know that there's better wings anywhere in Charlotte.  Seriously.   That grilled, smoky flavor oozes through every bite, and the thick cold ranch was the perfect compliment.  As I've stated on many occasions, if you're not charring/grilling your wings, you're simply doing it wrong.    VBGB does it right.",

    "text": "I'll start off by clarifying that this place really isn't my scene. Its a bit of a dark, grungy bar - kind of reminded me of bars from my old college town. Outside, it seems that about 50% of people were smoking, so it was pretty hard to escape the smoke. Even under the large covering with several \"no smoking\" signs, everyone was smoking.  To be fair, I went during a concert at the music factory. I'm sure this changed the bars clientel significantly. Its worth noting that they wont serve drinks in glass on a night of an event.  Beyond the atmosphere, this place was pretty solid. They had a large drink selection and a good beer list that had a little of everything. Even in the summer, they had 2 stouts and at least one other dark beer on draft. The food lived up to the hype I have heard. I had what was probably my favorite pretzel with beer cheese of anywhere. Very soon after ordering it, we were served a very large, soft pretzel that was well salted and slightly greasy with some beer cheese and spicy mustard. The pretzel was definitely a 10/10, the cheese I'd give a 6/10 as it seemed like a strange blend of high quality cheese and canned nacho cheese. Overall, as a restaurant, this place did quite a good job.",

They will reserve a table if you have a group, let you have the private room...if I could, I would throw every event here.  Second, the food here is GREAT.  I mean, you can't really go wrong with fried food, so that's always good.  I would come here for the Pretzel and cheese.  Best in town by far.  Last night, I tried the Chicken Kabob and the Steak Kabob.  Highly recommend!  It was delicious and a healthy alternative for anyone not interested in the fried food.  I didn't partake in \"Taco Tuesday\", but maybe next time.  Third, the staff is always so friendly.  They are great about giving recommendations and tastes, and there is always someone walking around picking up empty food trays.  If you're looking for just a good fun place with some great people watching, and you just want to have a beer and snack, this is the place to go.  Awesome before a concert, too, so you can just walk over.  Next time, I'm going to hit up the Giant Connect Four game.",

    "text": "VGBG is one the places that you come to in order to truly relax with friends and have a good time and eats. I have been here many times and every time is unique in the sense of the people or event that is going on there. I know that Tuesday nights are the place to be here because there is $3 specials for 12oz beers and some higher ABV beers on that list as well.   The food here is good and better than you would expect from bar food. My favorites are the wings and chicken kabobs! They are both taste and worth the try if you want a snack. The beer cheese is very good as well so don't forget to try that out as well. So the owners of VGBG also own 8.20 next door and I can honestly say they know how to make it a place people want to visit.   VGBG has a lot of outdoor games from Cornhole, Adult size Chess, Blocks ( Jenga for regular folks) , Connect Four,  ping pong, and hop stock if you have chalk I guess and variety of board games as well. This is a nice atmosphere and if you want to  go crazy and paint the town this isn't your vibe they keep it classy.   It's a nice fun relaxed vibe and I think people like that too. Since the place is so big you will enjoy the space accommodated for birthdays or celebrations.",

    "text": "So with my time in Charlotte coming to a close, the team has been looking to have team activities which included places where we could have adult beverages outside and play some games. VBGB is just the spot for that given its games (i.e., Ping Pong, volleyball, connect 4, cornhole, etc.), outside patio drinking, good bar food and of course good drinks. This joint has its own parking lot and is fairly large allowing for large groups to come and participate in activities. The bar is stocked with lots of good drinks inclusive of beers, whiskey, etc and the bartenders/waitresses are all super friendly. There is also a counter inside to go in and order some bar food inclusive of wings, tots, burgers, etc.   They have 3 or 4 games of cornhole ready to be uses, two ping pong tables, connect 4, life size chess, etc allowing for all members of the group to participate in any activity you want or just simply eat and drink at tables outside while watching all the action. All of the food items are good with plenty of bar options. Obviously a pub style so definitely great to get large groups so you can get a flavor for multiple different things. The Beer selection is also solid with many different options along with all of the other drink items available for people to order. This is a solid place to hit up with large groups or just if you want an option for all these different activities. Definitely recommend for folks in town.",

We had dinner--hubby had a bratwurst and I had the burger, sharing a large order of tater tots. The burger was juicy, a little too greasy for me, plus I added the honey mustard so it was messy. However the flavors were good, not the best burger but okay. My usual go to is the pulled chicken bbq sandwich on a pretzel roll, which I would order again. You order food from the line, pay and take a number. Then the servers bring out your meal and it's fairly fast for a Saturday night.  The beer line is separate at the bars both inside or outside by the games. Parking is tight so I always park across the street and walk. For events they charge for parking $5 but weeknights it can be free.",

Grease-dripping black fries and onion rings. And was clear kitchen knew what they were putting out. All of the rings on my side of the table (say 6 orders or so) were placed charcoal side down, pretty side up. So while no care was taken frying them, lots of care was taken to disguise them.

To the right of the entrance is the counter where you can place your order for food.  You order, take a number, and move along.  There are all kinds of things on the menu: burgers, pretzels, salads, wings, fried things, brats, and so on.  The prices are extremely reasonable.  If you're going to a show and not trying to break the bank for the evening on food/beverages, this is definitely the place to go.    Once you have your food ordered up, you can either take a seat at one of the long picnic tables and wait or make the wise decision and head on over to the bar to get your beer on.  All the local craft breweries have offerings, and there are other craft brews available from all over the place.  You can order all different sizes, from a 12 ounce cup to a jumbo-sized mug to a pitcher.  If it's busy, I recommend going the pitcher route so you don't have to keep going back and waiting in line.    Once you have your number for your food and your beer situation squared away, you can sit inside or outside.  Plenty of places to park it.  The staff brings the food out to you when it's ready and you're good to go.  The place was packed when we were there, but we had no problem finding a seat and the wait for the food was not bad at all.  This place seems to run pretty smoothly when things are busy, and you can get in and out in 30-45 minutes if you're in a rush to catch the opening act.  The food itself was pretty darn tasty.  I had a chicken brat and the lady went with quinoa salad.  We also got sweet potato fries.  Good stuff, and we spend about 16 bucks for the whole thing!  We will definitely be back!",

If you have friends with kids- this is a great place to go with children during the day. They have a giant chess set and some games. Kids can run around and get away with a lot. I once went here before some sort of Disney kids concert and it was packed with children dodging pints of beer.  3. It is HUGE. This is good if you are meeting up for a birthday or with a large group. This is a pet peeve of mine- only some places can really handle a giant group. This place can handle it.  4. It is corny- but I do love the rip off Banksy art work.  5. The beer selection is solid. There are also non beer choices. It is priced well.  6. POTATO LATKES ARE DELICIOUS. The pretzel and beer cheese is also fantastic. The menu isn't huge, but it is good bar food.  7. If it is too hot- they have covered areas and fans. If it is too cold- they have heaters.   The negative:  WHY OH WHY do you not invest in more plants/flowers? Go to a local nursery or home depot. Blow $500 on plants and it would make a huge transformation. I cannot for the life of me understand why this hasn't happened. They put in a volley ball section- but still- the plants are just sad. Please add more plants. It needs it.",

    "text": "This place is a pretty good contender for becoming an amazing beer garden like the ones in NYC. Jumbo-sized games (chess and Jenga) and spaces to play Cornhole Toss and ping-pong plus an amazing beer selection!  It doesn't seem to attract a huge crowd (I wonder why?), but I think it's a great place to come with a group of friends just wanting to enjoy a chill night out in Charlotte.  Maybe people only gather around here when the weather is warm? Hopefully I'll be able to go again this summer!",

Its a great spot to take people from out of town if you are going with a group of 10+ so they can meet people, play games like corn hole, giant Jenga, life sized chess, connect four, ping pong, etc. It is a great place to start the night off or finish a good night after a concert or dinner in the NC Music Factory.   Lots of good beer on tap! In my opinion( i'm a burger guru) the food is pretty good just not amazing. I have had food that is good and food that is average. My friends have the same opinion so I know its not just me! Usually Friday and Saturday nights they have a DJ spinning a really good mix to contribute to the trendy atmosphere.",

Although, I havent eaten here I thoroughly do enjoy the very laidback and chill atmposphere here. Me and a friend went here one night after we visited Wet Willie's for some more libations. There was a band, huge outdoor games to play and very extensive beer list. We enoyed ourselves. Also took my husbad here right before he started 3rd year of medical school for a rest and relaxtion day. The weather was nice, we drank craft beer and played connect four. An awesome time all around.",

The staff explained the menu and the ordering system to us and were very knowledgeable about all the drinks as well.  They had an awesome gluten free beer on tap and even provided some info about a brewery nearby with a lot of gluten free options.  We sat outside and they had jenga, apples to apples and pretty much any other game you can think of available to play.  I ordered the chicken skewers and others in my party ordered the sandwiches.  Everything was awesome!  This place really started off our trip on a high note and I can't wait to visit again.",

All their dipping sauces (blue cheese, ranch, etc) are all made from scratch which I think says a lot about the quality of the whole place. The drinks are marvelous. If you've ever been to an actual German Beer Garden, they've nailed the authenticity. Right down to the steins that the beer is served in. And there's a giant ice rail to keep your beer cold... SO AWESOME. The outdoor patio and volleyball courts are a huge hit. They host trivia and lots of events throughout the year too. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",

    "text": "I'd been wanting to try this place for some time, so when my wife said that several of her coworkers were getting together there for a little holiday get together I jumped at the chance.   The place is interesting; you walk in to a good sized bar area with a nice U shaped bar with an ice rail to keep your beer cold. As you walk in the food ordering window is to the right, and the portion of the bar where you order your drinks is straight ahead. There are a couple of separate dining areas for large groups, and there is a nice patio with tons of super sized games. When we were there they had a large connect four game, 2ping pong tables, 3 or 4 corn hole set ups, a giant chess board, and 2 large jenga sets. There seems to be something for everyone, and the place was packed.  The service was decent; there was no wait staff wandering around checking on people. If you want a beer you have to go to the bar, and if you want food you have to go to the window. Not a bad set up, but it can get backed up at times.  The food was good, we got a little of all of the finger type foods so that everyone could try multiple things. Fried pickles, soft pretzels with beer cheese, hot wings, nachos, sweet potato fries, etc... Everything was good, the pretzels and beer cheese was great.  Now, on to the most important part.... The beer. The beer selection seemed to be well thought out; a nice mixture of NC locals, southeast regionals, and nation craft beers. There was also a nice mixture of APA's, IPA's, Porters, Stouts, etc... Too often a craft beer bar will have 20-30 taps and more than half of them are IPA's, and big stouts, and other styles get left out to the dismay of casual beer drinkers that aren't into these styles. I spent most of the evening drinking Birdsong Jalapeno Pale, and Lagunitas Brown Sugga. All for a reasonable price.  Overall,  I was impressed with this place and look forward to going back",

Last night we went to see a Motley Crue cover band and hit up this place for some pregaming, we got some seats pulled up right at the bar and ordered some drinks and shots, the bartenders were on point and very fast. I also love the ice rail lining the bar to keep drinks cold.  . . The inside is huge with a kitchen that brings the flavor out with foods ranging from sandwiches and burgers to pretzels and salads. Outside patio area is very big with tons of seating, and also has a lot of volleyball courts! This place is the perfect spot to hang with friends and unwind.",

Given that, there's no way I was going to love it here.  Despite the high ratings by others, I just wasn't thrilled to be here. Same as the time before (this was only my 2nd time here). The place gets way too packed, way too loud, and overall, I find it a bit obnoxious.   This time, I opted to order food (not Cider, like last time)...and the line was quite slow moving. Then I had to repeat my order 3X because the cashier couldn't hear me (again, way too loud here). The food choices are pretty basic (beer foods?), so I just decided to go with their Boneless Chicken Bites (Honey with BBQ Sauce) and their Chips (no Fries?!?).  Again, didn't love it...at all. In fact, I wished I ordered something from 8.2.0 next door the whole time I was there. :(  I totally get that if you ARE a beer fan, chances are you'll at least like it here. Unfortunately, just not my thing.",

The space is great for hanging out with a group of friends and it seems to be pretty kid friendly as we've seen multiple families come here. My only wish is that they offered more non-alcoholic drinks. I know they're a bar, but most other bars and breweries in Charlotte offer a variety of drinks.",

    "text": "My brother-in-law introduced me to this bar several years before I moved to the Charlotte area and it's grown a big place in my heart! This isn't a super classy bar or a super divey bar... it's a good feel, people bar! If the sand volleyball, giant sized games and music doesn't pull you in, the staff and great beer selection will!  The food is really good and definitely a step up from regular bar food. I've had about everything on the menu so I won't bore you with reviewing every item on the menu, but I can share some of my favorite! Their beer cheese is on point, don't just get it with the pretzel, try it with the fried pickles or something else... it's too good not to! Their gourmet grilled cheese is one of my favorite sandwiches... I mean how can you resist anything on a pretzel bun anyways?! Speaking of pretzels, theirs is one of my favorites in the city. May not take the #1 place, but pretty close! The Wango Tango wings are where it's at if you're looking to get saucy! The totchos (nachos, but with tots) are a MUST!   Beware since they are located in the music factory, there are lots of events and because they get slammed sometimes they put up a Special Events Menu... so don't be too disappointed if you come on a night when there's a concert, they probably won't have their full menu. On the flip side, they do have specials on Fridays at lunch (maybe on Saturdays and sundays, but not for sure). One time they had this Bruschetta Melt... it was on a pretzel bun so you can only imagine how delicious it sounds and was!! So keep your eyes open for some yummy surprises!  As far as drinks, this is definitely more of a beer bar than another else. Yes, they have liquor and wine... but their beer selection is where it's at! They rotate their beers pretty frequently so don't be surprised if you get something you absolutely love one week and come back the next and it's not there... it's happens to the best of us and you'll have another soon enough! Lots of local beers, gotta rep drinking local in NC!   I'm lucky to now work right across the street so I may frequent this place a little more than I should, but I can't say I'm upset about it! Definitely check it out if you're looking for a new chill spot or somewhere to grab a beer before your concert in the music factory! You can thank me later!",

Most of my co-workers ordered beer and enjoyed their drinks as well.  It is very dark inside which took a little getting used to.  There is a walk up window in the corner to place your order and you're given a number and they bring it over to you.  I ordered they pulled chicken sandwich on a soft pretzel roll with bbq sauce and sweet potato fries..........yummy!  Everything was great for a Tuesday night, the chicken, the fries, and the drinks. They also have a cool iced area around the bar that you can sit your drink on to keep it cold, really neat.",

I remember when the volleyball set up wasn't there, but there were always games, the side and back patio, and delicious food! Beer cheese and pretzel-YES! This is the place where I had an aha moment and realized that it was a possible tasty combination. The nachos are also a go-to, along with the fried pickles and jalapenos. Grab your condiments and utensils which live along the wall. I also like that they have a water tap at the bar, and a water station outside because the fantastic bartenders are busy slinging beer and cocktails!",

We've enjoyed trivia nights there too, and something is super fun about sitting in the bar on a hot CLT night and placing your beer on the frozen part of the bar to keep it extra refreshing. They have volley ball many nights and a large patio to enjoy. The food is average to good, their pretzels with beer cheese is my favorite- how can you go wrong with that?",

When you go to VBGB and 8.2.0 it's like you are in a small village with shops you can go to but they are places to meet friends, eat great food, drink local IPA, wine or whatever you care for and hang out. It's by far one of the coolest local joints I've been to in a while.  Love the concept.  Love the atmosphere.",

    "text": "VBGB is a place I came to my first weekend in Charlotte after seeing Lettuce at the Underground. Going there on a Friday night and looking around I had no idea this would be a popular place to come play trivia.  My friends and I are regulars at Lebowski's on Tuesday nights but we had a Thursday night trivia itch and decided to look around at some places. VBGB had great reviews so we decided on it.  Trivia starts at 8:15 - which is a little later for my taste, but that's just about the only complaint I can think of in the way they do trivia. We called ahead and the lady told us to get there around 7:30 to get good seats. They do trivia outside under a giant enclosure during the winter where I'm guessing in the summer is all open. Huge area outside and there was plenty of space for the trivia peeps who decided to show up.   I think it's hosted by Rave Trivia. The way the rounds were set up was SUPER ORGANIZED but still fresh each round. The dude who asks the questions was hilarious, and the questions got progressively harder as the questions and rounds went by, which is always fun. They did wait a pretty good amount of time between rounds, but I guess that's a little bit attributed to how many teams were there (a lot).  As you'd expect, there are a ton of beer options and there's something for everyone. When outside, you go up to the middle window and place your order. Pretty simple.   We decided to eat dinner there as well and it was delicious. To order, you go inside to the front of the kitchen where there's a giant \"EAT\" sign. Easy process to order and then they bring your food out to your number at your table. I got the burger with tots. The burger was juicy and well cooked and the tots were AWESOME and served with a fire sauce that I would put on most things. The pretzel bites were on special that night so we did get a bunch of those with the beer cheese. Some of the best pretzels I've had in a while and the beer cheese was perfect. These are a must get whether you're at trivia or if you're just stopping by for a beer.  All in all, loved VBGB. I doubt it will end up being our regular place for trivia but it will definitely be a nice change of pace when we want to have a later night or do something a little more low key on a Thursday night. Also a great spot to go to before or after a show over by the Fillmore!",

Although it was a very cold night the tent was completely closed so it was not unbearably cold inside. They do have a small parking lot but parking was full when we got there so we had to park across the street and walk. Not too far.   My husband and I were not too hungry so we ordered a jumbo pretzel with cheese sauce to split. I added a side of fried jalapenos for $1. The prices here are very good. The pretzel was very good as well. Big and warm with just the right amount of salt. Everything I tried here I really enjoyed. My husband ordered the Kentucky bourbon ale and I had (a couple lol) chocolate peanut butter imperial stouts.   A great time, great food and great beer was had by all. We came in third in trivia and won a gift card! They give the top 3 prizes! Woo hoo! I live in Florida but would definitely come here again on another visit!",

It has a great vibe, quick and friendly service, not overly crowded, and the food is really good! We ordered the giant pretzel- the beer cheese is really good! I had the pork brat on the roll. I really enjoyed it, the roll was soft and not too hard or crunchy, like at some places.  My husband had the buffalo chicken tacos which were spicy and delicious.  Our friends ordered the fried pickle appetizer- they was really good too! They were chip not spear style.  The pickles had a light, crispy batter and had a bit of spice.   I loved the ambiance of the place too, with hip music and decor. I love the overhead string lights as well.  This place was more biergarten-ish than I was expecting. They also have a back patio which could be fun come spring.   I will definitelty be back to VBGB's next time I am in the area!",

I cannot say enough good things about having the party here.  I worked with Maria throughout the process and she made it very easy.  They let us reserve a private room inside the building, we were able to close the door off so the surprise guest could open the door and walk in. We were able to arrive early and decorate the room as we wanted.    We were also sent food options and were able to have a few appetizers set up upon our arrival.  This spot was great!!  From start to finish the service was great and everyone had a wonderful time.  Even down to asking for trash bags to take some of the decorations home in they went out of their way to help us.  I cannot recommend this enough if you are looking for a spot for a group event.  ***Also do not forget to get the pretzels  = AMAZING!!***",

We took a risk and it was a good experience, the questions were tough, but not too tough - and #1:  NO CHEATERS allowed.  There have been way too many places that let people just use their smart phones to look up answers - what's the point!?!  yes, you may win a gift certificate, but that's not in the True spirit of trivia.  Though this place is in the NC Music Factory and a bit hard to use in a sentence, VBGB has a lot of potential.  The out door patio that is overlooked by the historic JFG coffee sign was great (that's where trivia took place).  There is no wait service, so you walk up to the bar windows and order...  pretty good system and it gets you up and out of your chairs for some mingling.  The food is the same way, there is a line to order and then they give you a number where they bring out your food once it's ready.  I only ordered a pretzel, but it was pretty darn good.  I had a huge stein of beer though and that got me through the rest of the week (well, one more day).",

Modern Beer Hall look, \"Street\" Art on a few walls!  Looks Good!  Really liked the \"Ice Bar\": You can sit your drinks on it to keep them cool!  Huge outdoor eating/drinking area, with a stage.  The food was good, the service was very good:  Here is my numerical rating: Pretzel (sprocket flying FANTASTIC) 5+, Chips 3.0, Kraut 4.0, Sweet Potato Fries 3.79, Pretzel Bun 3.2, Onion Rings 3.85, The Bratwurst was a HUGE letdown a disappointing 2.75 or less, \"Street\" Art Very cool 4.9, Service Speed 5+, Accuracy 5,  The girl at the counter told us how to get everything we wanted!!!  You will not get that kind of service modeled in many places!  My concerns other than some of the food:  I did not get a Beer, my friend did and said it was good, though most of the Beer's he wanted to order they had run out of???  We were shocked, mostly because it is early Tuesday evening!  We got the last parking place, so when we walked in we were surprised how small the \"crowd was!  My friend said each person must have driven.  I was wondering if some people drove more than one car, because there was little parking left on the street!   Music was Very Good, though now the do have TV, probably a lot of folks like TV, I think it's an unneeded distraction!  This was an enjoyable evening and I would (probably will) return when the weather is cooler.",

    "text": "It's a beer garden. With an ice bar. That should be enough information for you to go. But in case you want a bit more to this review, here it is.   Lets start with the best part - the brews. Since it's a beer garden, you won't find any Miller Lite, Bud Light options here (OK, there is PBR for those who want to drink cheap or just get back to a domestic style). We're looking at all craft brews including some from NC breweries and some from outside the state. But you can always appreciate a bar paying homage to the state. The beers are constantly being rotated out. Which gives you a new beer to try every time but also makes you want to type a : (  if a tasty selection is no longer available.   And then there's the ice bar. That's right, a snow strip that travels around the bar that allows you to keep you beer chilled at all times. Why every bar doesn't have this is beyond me.   The food deserves a nod of the cap as well. On Monday's, chef Matt creates his own burger, slathering on sauces and toppings of really whatever he wants to create that day and gives it to you for the event tastier price of $5. Then there's the boneless wings with the Dinosaur BBQ sauce. I highly recommend the Wango Tango sauce, giving you a slight kick and lots of flavor. Dip em in the blue cheese and thank me later. And of course, the VBGB pretzel. Iconic. Enough to split for a snack. And comes with beer cheese.   Wait... wait... there's more. Best bar idea to me has always been hey, lets bring games into the bar. Here you'll find jenga, connect four, chess, cornhole and ping pong. An easy spot to stay at for hours. Great for big kids of all ages. Because lets face it. We all want to kick ass in connect four.   Even better, I applaud owners Tom and Kara for an amazing staff. Having worked in the service industry for 6 years, I appreciate good service. And good, constant service every time you go in is something to recognize. Extra applause to Chris. Great bartender.   And an extra note, go on Tuesdays - beers are only $3. Love VBGB but if you stay there too long, you'll rack up a nice bill since it's all higher priced crafts.",

    "text": "Tucked away into this weird, completely out of the way, limited-access cop-road-block-breathilizer-worthy corner is a beer bar. It's a little metal and stone to be called a Biergarten, painted beech trees on black walls aside, especially since there's maybe two-three German ales on tap - but still, cool.  Vegan's are going to have it a bit rough but there's plenty for the cheese loving set to scarf. Food prices are ridiculously low. And the pretzal....ah, the pretzal... is insane. Charred to black, sweet, yeasty, beer cheese skunky and mustardy. Fantastic with beer. Get it.  Stay away from the latkes, meh, but the chips are good and crisp. And the burger, while veg and in no way healthy, was satisfying. Service was smiley and quick.   There were many Affliction shirts stretched across many fake-tanned biceps on the night we went. Many crotch rockets parked in many annoying ways, all over the expansive lot. Both of those things scare me. Could've been Primus's fault, as they were playing next door. Fingers  crossed.  There isn't a TV in sight. I'm hoping this is deliberate, rather than \"whoops, the semi stuffed with flatscreens hasn't made it to town yet\".  Prices are a bit high for CLT but not compared to surrounding establishments, so they'll do just fine at 6-7 average for a pint. There are many good brews to be had, but I wish for a few more exotics and high gravs. And surely, more German beers. C'mon now.",

    "text": "We came here last night after seeing John Witherspoon at the Comedy Zone. We had heard a lot of good things about this place and weren't ready to end the night, so we stopped by to test their delicious looking pretzels I was drooling over on Yelp.  The bar layout is large and takes up about half of the inside. It is basically in the shape of the letter W with lots of seating in and around it. Being our first time here I told our bartender that I like stouts, and to surprise me. He returned with a Blue Point Oatmeal Stout and it was crazy good. Samuel Smith still makes the best one I have ever had, but this one is right there behind it. Another great surprise was the ice block lane that lined the entire bar. Sit your mug on the ice lane, and it will stay cold between bites and sips.   Only odd thing about this place is when you want to order some food, you have to get up, leave your spot at the bar, and walk over to the order window to place and pay for your order. They will then deliver the food to you at the bar so not a huge inconvenience, but if the place is packed then it adds another step between just sitting and drinking which could result in you waiting in line.  The pretzel was amazing, right up there with The Flying Saucer's if not better. It comes with a homemade beer cheese sauce which we also used on our order of Wango Tango chicken bites. These were also very good. The Wango Tango sauce has a spicy BBQ taste, very similar to Midtown Sundries Barbalo flavor. They did charge a dollar for extra dipping sauce, which is lame, but seems to be the norm now a days.   The beer and the bar food were both great.  It was to hot to care about the outdoor seating, but there was a lot of it.  The giant patio out back has more square feet than the inside.   We will definitely be back, not a place we would drive all the way downtown to visit, but whatever event brings us to the NC Music Factory again this will be one of our stops while we are down there.",

The owners have been extremely accomodating to our growing group of bikers and are constantly making small improvements to keep us coming back.  I am not a huge beer fan, but can appreciate a good brew.  I recently purchased one of their beer flights to sample a variety of the beers on tap (26-28 degrees per digital readout).  I was able to find a few that I enjoyed immensly, and they are always rotating a few new ones in for me to try.  You are sure to find something you like, as well as new flavor adventures.  My favorite are the chocolate stouts and an orange blossom pilsner.  The food is fantastic!  It is a very simple menu focusing on brats and other beer friendly food.  My favorite is the chicken spinach feta brat on a pretzel roll with a side of sweet potato fries.  I also need to try the edamame, as it is overall one of my favorite snacks.  VBGB is a fantastic place, great atmosphere and great libations.

They also have little \"to go\" type windows on the back of the bar so people on the deck can get served as well. Along with the ping pong, and other bar games on the deck this makes this place a great little summer venue for having some cold brews.",

Yes they have beach volleyball courts!!  Ever-changing menu of national and local beers at decent prices and above average german-inspired bar food. The pretzel is huge and the beer cheese is homemade and delicious. I was a little disappointed with the brats as they were small and a little under cooked. In addition, they wouldn't let us get a side of fries with a normal brats because they were \"proportioned to the brat special\" what?! Anyways, the fries were delicious though proportions were small.  Love the chill rail on the bar and communal beer hall tables. Service always seems to be present and helpful. This place gets busy pre shows so get here early!",

There are sand volleyball courts if you are so inclined. If you are more cerebral, there is life-size Chess and life size connect-four. There are several different seating areas including a large tent. I was not real sure what the membership card was at the door but as middle agers, we appreciated being carded! We weren't in a drinking mood so we just got some brats and waters. Food came quickly and everything seemed organized. Some of the shot specials were appealing and only $5.

Although I typically choose stouts and porters, the jalapeno description reeled me in.  It wasn't as spicy hot as I would have preferred, but it had a nice flavor.  They also offered wine at a reasonable $6.00 a glass. You order your food from a window, take a number, and your meal arrives.  I had the grilled cheese with tomato.  I asked them to hold the bacon, which they did.  The pretzel bun was nicely soft.  Also had an order of fried jalapenos (still hoping to catch that burn).  It arrived with beer-cheese dip.  Very good and addictive. Experienced a fun and festive evening!",

A friend met me here for my 1 night in town, and she said she wanted to show me something different rather than a generic bar.  Glad she took me here.  First off, they had a ton of beers on tap and for some reason it was $3 beer night.  I chatted with my bartender for a bit to help choose my first beer, but the 2nd and 3rd beers were all her doing.  I have no idea what I drank but all 3 were good, and my tab was $9 before tax and tip.  I've had single beers before that cost $9.  The rest of place is just awesome if you want to be entertained.  Inside a big bar with World Series of Poker playing on the TV (oh hey, I made that show).  Outside there's a full volleyball court with sand.  WTF!?  Super-sized Connect 4 games.  Board games a plenty.  I played Battleship outside at midnight at a bar drinking a beer.  Pretty sure that's as good as it gets for a Tuesday!",

First of all, they have a huge patio, volleyball courts, ping pong, corn hole... you could basically stay there all day and have a great time.   The beer selection is great, I've never been there and haven't found something new and different to try. They tend to stick with regional breweries with I like but have some pretty good micro brews from the entire US. Oh, if you are a bud lite person they have that too, though people might look at you funny.   I think one of the best things about this place if that the food is LEGIT. German style plates that are delicious. If it's your first time, you cannot leave without their soft pretzel with beer cheese. I know some girls that would rather go out with this pretzel and beer cheese than their boyfriends... and vice-versa.   Service is ok, one thing that annoys me (when not too busy) is that they take your beer as soon as you finish it.. sometimes even before your last sip... some people just call that a good way to keep your glass full... it's irritating at times.   Whether you're going to the Fillmore or the NC Music Factory to catch a show or just going out for a couple of pints. This is a great place to begin and end your evening...",

    "text": "looking for a cool spot at the NC music factory? then definitely check out this bar as I can always count on keeping friends/family entertained! Don't come hungry though, unless your looking for an over priced average meal.   Very similar to Noda's \"Blind Pig\", VBGB is loaded with tons of entertainment. Some of which include volleyball, giant jenga, and connect four. This is just a few of the many games they have, which is actually very trendy with the bar scenes now days. Another thing I cannot forget to mention, is the large space outside! It is absolutely huge and wraps around the building. Plenty of seating and partially covered in the winter months. Perfect for when your looking for a place to hangout and keep warm.  The bar is great for just about anyone. It is a full bar and they have specials everyday. Furthermore, their selection of beer is fantastic! Most of it is local and reasonably priced. The service is always good and they are well staffed. As for the food, not so great.   I find it very strange when a bar doesn't have french fries! You can find just about any other kind of bar food, but just not that..which is why they received three stars from me. The food itself is ehhh.. okay. Very average. Probably good for someone that is hammered and looking to sober up. I remember a time when I was here with some friends, and we decided to venture uptown when we got hungry, because we all knew how the food was. What a great idea that was.  Parking is free as long as you don't mind walking across the street. you might park pretty far back though, as it is the same parking lot everyone uses at the Music Factory. Also, please note that they do tow! I had a terrible experience with this and would hate for anyone to ever have to go through what I did.",

    "text": "I visited VBGB Beer Hall and Garden last Saturday night for a birthday party.  It's a great venue for large group gatherings.  The restaurant/bar is presumably modeled after German beer halls and gardens.  Inside, there is a huge horseshoe-shaped bar with plenty of seating.  On the floor, there are several large picnic-style, communal tables (like a German beer garden would have).  Above, there are a handful of TV displays tuned to sports.  Outside, there is big patio with more tables and many games.  Games include giant Jenga, giant Connect Four, giant chess, cornhole, and more.  Since it was cold outside, the patio was enclosed and heat lamps were brought out to provide a measure of warmth.  Ample free parking is available in a paved parking lot directly outside the building.  I'm not sure when this place opened, but it feels relatively new.  A reservation was made for our party of 20+, so two tables were blocked off with signs for our group.  You can get beer at the bar and there's a window by the kitchen where you can order food.  After placing your food order, you're given a number to place at your table and your food is brought out to you.  VBGB's food menu mainly consists of bar food such as fries, onion rings, wings, chicken tenders, and burgers.  I was told by the staff that their most popular items are their jumbo pretzels, bratwurst, and kabobs.  I like their affordable pricing -- not a single item over $10.  I tried the following: Chicken bratwurst with spinach and feta ($6) Quinoa salad ($3) - black beans, corn, tomato, cilantro, lime vinaigrette, colored tortillas Fried pickles ($3) Cinn-A-Yum pretzel ($5) - jumbo pretzel covered in cinnamon & sugar, w/ vanilla icing on the side  Complimentary sauerkraut and sauteed peppers and onions are available for any bratwurst or hot dog order upon request.  I had sauerkraut put on my chicken brat.  I also had it served in VBGB's housemade pretzel bun, so I ended up with a very unique brat.  It wasn't a pork brat and it wasn't served in a typical bun.  It didn't take very long for the food to arrive from the kitchen.  The brat was freshly grilled and the bun was freshly toasted.  The brat was large, but I wouldn't consider it jumbo.  The meat was juicy and seasoned well.  I could taste the spinach and feta, but the flavors were subtle.  The sauerkraut wasn't bad.  As for the bun, it definitely tasted like and almost had the consistency of a pretzel.  The quinoa salad was good.  It was served with a side of hard, colored tortillas.  I could have done without the tortillas and more quinoa.  The quinoa salad was healthy and refreshing.  It was served in a small paper tray.  The fried pickles were served piping hot.  They came with a side of dipping sauce, which I didn't try.  The fried pickles were good enough on their own.  I recommend sharing this side as it's a bit greasy.  The Cinn-A-Yum pretzel is the dessert spin on VBGB's jumbo pretzel.  The pretzel is indeed jumbo and they coat it in a thick layer of cinnamon and sugar.  It's expectedly sweet and you even have the option of having it coated with vanilla, chocolate, caramel, or raspberry icing.  I had the (vanilla) icing served on the side and used it as a dip.  Due to their sheer size, I recommend sharing these pretzels too.  Jessica was our server and she seemed pretty cool.  Very friendly, as were many of the staff.  Overall, I had a good time at VBGB.  It had a nice relaxed and casual atmosphere and proved to be a good meeting place for a big group of friends.  Trivia: VBGB stands for Very Big German Beer.",

    "text": "Here's the problem when you go somewhere not knowing anything about it. You look at the website and you look at Yelp. While it said \"No\" for \"good for kids\", it said \"average\" for loudness \" (it wasn't, it's VERY loud), it did try to present as a place to get some good food. This place is a straight up BAR. Don't go expecting it to be anything else. If this were explained better on the website (or the Yelp description), I would have never picked this location for a dinner for 2 seniors, 3 adults and a 5 yr old on our way to a high school performance.  It was a Friday evening and we met at 5:15. I don't know the area well and let me say - it's NOT a great area. Yikes. Then - there is not ample parking. There must have been something going on at the concert hall because there was NO parking. Thankfully, one senior was handicapped and we found a spot.  The next part was the sticking point of the night. There is security throughout the whole place. It was off-putting and meant to me there were problems in the past. Upon entering (mind you again, it's 5:15 and we just wanted dinner), I was asked for my ID. I asked the woman why she needed my ID and she said they had to have an ID for every party there. I said we weren't drinking, we were just eating and she said it didn't matter. Um... I did NOT like that. It felt very... hood. I was totally embarrassed.   The place was also crazy loud. My poor senior dad had to take out his hearing aids, even inside. Also - nearly all the tables were reserved, even though many tables were empty. Finally a party left inside and we sat down. It was a degree or two less noisy inside.   The food however - WAS good. My dad loved his brat and said the potato salad was fabulous. I thought the hot dog was good along with the pretzel rolls. The handmade potato chips were also great. Mom and my SIL had a fancy grilled cheese that was very good.  It's definitely a place for the 21-40 crowd or those with friends looking for a nice bar. The games and things were very cool (in fact, my niece LOVED the giant connect 4 and beat a drunk guy). We were all entertained by that.  So again, my only complaint is just that it should be better described on their website. The food is yummy, but it is a bar-crowd place.",

The food was decent, the ciders were $7 each, the chicken bites were heavily sauced. I wouldn't come out here on purpose but we went to see a concert at The Fillmore so we had time to fill. It was crowded and loud, I'm not a fan of either. You've been warned. They allow customers to bring their dog and be on the patio. It seems like more of a hang out, the waiters keep coming around trying to bus your area to get customers in and out fast.",

What I love about the VBGB is that there's a huge selection of beers and a nice menu of things to eat.  The inside is dark and urban divebar chic.  The layout is nice and there are plenty of things to do for those that don't like eating pretzels and cheese at picnic tables.  Cornhole...Ginormous Connect Four...etc...etc.  Great beer selection...great food....things to do....what drawbacks?  I don't want to use that word that is so commonly thrown around to disparage the PBR swilling, nerd glasses wearing, skinny jean donning, ear spacered...waxed mustachios we so often see.  Let's just say...the crowd here varies depending on the day of week and what time it is, but you'll definitely see people that, \"did it before you, saw them before you, are more indie than you, know that band, are in a band, used to be into what you're into...but are so over it, have been drinking PBR before it was cool, blah blah blah.\"  If you're coming here to mingle...you will most definitely run into this crowd.  The best way to experience VBGB is to come with a group and enjoy it free of the baloney.  Try:  The Spaten Optimator with a brat and kraut  Avoid:  Swilling (there's alot of great beer on tap)",

Their website boasts no Friday cover ever, but I have never known them to charge a cover (and I prickle at the practice of paying just to drink somewhere, especially if there isn't a band).   The best deal they have is on Tuesday night, where almost any of their craft beer drafts are only $3 (let me take a moment to mourn over the fact that they used to only charge $2 on Tuesday). Their beer selection is excellent, and they continually swap out their inventory. This can lead to heartbreak when they no longer carry your favorite beer but makes room for you to discover a new favorite! The bartenders here are excellent and knowledgeable enough to help you navigate what can be an overwhelming selection for a novice beer drinker. They are also happy to hand out samples.   This is also a great location to socialize. They have long tables for big groups, and plenty of board games in addition to life size chess and connect four. They have self serve water towers both inside and outside which is perfect when you need more water but don't want to wait in line at the bar.",

Meeting a Yelp friend (you know who you are) for a birthday party, I was impressed with the substantial beer selections and the unique pairings of proper beer food to go with it. I've posted a pic of the beer menu that is posted on the wall and they don't just sell pints - they offer smaller \"taster\" sizes if you really want to explore the offerings.  As for the food impression, I liked it. Brats, pretzels, pretzel bites and more. One of the folks at the table had the full size pretzel and it was a massive thing with a decent sized pot of dipping cheese. It looked good. On the other hand, my brat with onions and peppers and sauerkraut was awesome. I had a side of the potato salad and was not disappointed. Served warm, with a vinegar tang and bits of bacon in there, it was excellent. Next time, I might just have the potato salad and be done.  And then, my complaint. I am not a fan of bars that feel they need to set up entertainment. Whether it's bingo or trivia, when the speaker blasts so loud that you can't have a normal conversation even when screaming, I get up and go. And that's why I left VBGB after just the one beer even though I was having a good time up to then with new friends. Sorry, with this I had to drop a star.  Parking is tight, especially when there is something going on at the Amphitheater next door.",

Whether you are only looking for a sit down chill night or one full of games, laughs and good tunes, VBGB will provide it all!! My favorite is when they have a DJ set up on the patio.

    "text": "I went here on a Saturday night a few weeks back and was pleasantly surprised as to how nice the place was inside and how great the patio area was in the back.  But what really threw me was how dead the place was on a Saturday night.   Atmosphere - Large, brick, concrete, pressurized wood, weird video on wall outside, cheerful,...empty.   Service - Excellent. The staff was top notch and despite being slow they were not all \"get out, your bothering us\" they were like \"Hey, what do you want to sample...I recommend this...try that...\" They really made it a first rate experience.   Beverages - I had two different types of beer and sampled a few others...but I forget the names...all were all tasty.  I suggest trying some samples to find the one that is best for you. Sorry, no commercial beers here (i.e. no Bud Light).   Overall - Everyone, including myself, had a great time here. I just hope that based on the attendance of that night I will have the opportunity to go back there again.",

    "text": "Beer good. Oh and they have many, yes they do. Good selections, multiple sizes... Yah, so the frost trough may be described as gimmicky by many, but who cares? It keeps me beer cold, guys!   BEER: No complaints. Though VBGB, if you're listening, I'll tack on another star if you would just let me get a Lambic in something other than a puny flute! (A pitcher would be nice. You know... just in case you decide that this is a marvelous idea.)  Also, they do usually have wine specials, which I've seen people get and be happy with.   FOOD: Haven't experienced too much, but the wings are good, and the sweet potato fries are great filler.  SERVICE: Great! Lovely conversation, prompt service. Definitely a high point of this place.  ATMOSPHERE: It definitely feels like a beer hall, and I like it. Beautiful murals. Great layout, very relaxed. Only complaint is that the benches could be a lot closer to the bar and tables. Not sure how legit this complaint is since I'm short, but it sure as hell is a detriment in my book.  Overall, good hang out and I know I'll be back. Wish they had a little more going on in the specials department, but it's one of three places in Charlotte that I can get my favorite beer, so I'm a bit dependent. Great place to bring friends, that's for sure.",

You must try the pulled chicken sandwich with dinosaur sauce and of course the famous pretzels with beer cheese. Wether you feel like sitting inside or outside you're bound to have a wonderful time. They've got life sized chess, connect four, jenga, plus a massive patio and volleyball courts outside. It's all around an awesome experience!",

As many have noted, the pretzel with beer cheese in a must-have, and I've also found the different brats and potato pancakes to be very tasty. VBGB has an incredible beer selection, and I also really enjoy the cider they have on tap.   I've actually found it to be a great place to bring kids during off hours as the beer garden gives them lots of room to run around. Every time I've been to VGBG, there have also been other kids there, so you definitely get a family-friendly vibe here even though it is ostensibly a bar.  The owners are extremely friendly and always stop by to say a few nice words when we visit. I also love VBGB's location below the iconic JFG sign.   In sum, I am a fan.",

They have a great beer selection featuring lots of local and North Carolina breweries and the food is decent enough (could be better in my opinion). I really like the layout of ordering food at the window, they just add it to your tab and bring it out to you. Still hungry after your pretzel, just go order something else! The pretzel is delicious but the beer cheese needs a little work - tastes like some kind of velvetta/American/nacho hybrid - cheddar would be better! Worth getting though, I definitely go for the beer and atmosphere. Lots of seating inside and outside too.",

Great crowd for this particular show but could vary depending upon what band is playing. Fairly good selection of beers on tap that include some great local brews from NoDA Brewing and Birdsong Brewery. You walk up to order food at 'window' to the right immediately after you walk in and get a number that you take back to where ever you feel like sitting. Cozy up to a stranger and make friends! Simple food menu that works really well with beer. They even have sand volleyball courts outside. Look forward to my next visit before & after a concert.",
