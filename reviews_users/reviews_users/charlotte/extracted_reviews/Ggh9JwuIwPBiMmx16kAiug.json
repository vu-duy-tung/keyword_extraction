    "text": "I was passing through town on my way to South Carolina for sports business, as usual and was craving sushi so I went to the Cowfish. There was a 2.5 hour wait, so I decided to go across the street and try Sushi Guru. I actually walked past the place because it is in the right corner of the building. I was quickly seated seeing their was hardly nobody there at 2:30 on a Saturday afternoon. I asked the waitress the heat difference between the spicy tuna and extremely spicy tuna. She responded with \"It's hot.\" I thought to myself, duh, but what would the heat level be compared to? Anyways I got the extremely spicy tuna, Philly, crunchy, and California rolls. The extremely spicy tuna was hot but not what I'd call extremely hot. The Cali roll was a Cali roll, and the Philly was a Philly, nothing special. The crunchy roll and rolled in potato chips and fried instead of tempura flakes. It had an interesting taste and was pleasing. They are a sushi bar that loves to pack the cucumber in their rolls which overpowers the flavor in your mouth.   The big negative is they don't have a fountain soda machine, They serve you cans. Don't know if they charged by can like Ru-San's because I only had one, and the waitress checked on me twice in the 30 minutes I was there. That's bad seeing the final 10 minutes I was there I was the only one there.  Overall Sushi Guru is O.K., and is a good backup plan if you wanted to go to the Cowfish and they have an eternal wait, and in need of a sushi fix.",

The only reason I didn't give it a higher rating is because it is a bit pricey.  It is better than Cowfish and a lot less crowded.  I have never had to wait for a table which is a definite plus.  I, too, believe this is the best place to get sushi in Charlotte.",

It's a little off the beaten path (next to Roosters) across from the South Park Mall.  The room is small as is the sushi bar but the lighting and overall vibe is fine. I've tried every sushi joint in this city and have never felt compelled to write a review.  We had the sashimi pizza which was not only creative, but delicious.  Loved the jalepeno and the guru rolls.  They also offer all the \"traditional\" sushi options.  The pizza and the rolls were $12 each, which is very reasonable for good sushi.  Highly, highly recommend.  Can't wait to go back.",

We also had the Southpark Roll and it was very good, fried sushi so it's a little unhealthy but at least it's filling (unlike normal Sushi). The Rainbow Roll was not bad but I wouldn't repeat it. It's a bit small restaurant but the atmosphere is nice and quite; and prices are not bad for Sushi at all. Overall, I'm a fan and would go there again",

    "text": "I'm torn on this one. I LOVED the old Cyros, and Sushi Guru has some of the same rolls as they did before, plus some even more inventive ones. While the fish wasn't as good as it had been when it was Cyros, it was still better than most places (though trailing Yama and Cowfish). The problem i had last night was the service. I'm pregnant, and while my MD says sushi is fine when from a reputable place (it's flash frozen in NC, which kills the parasites), I still have to avoid high mercury fish. Since I like to eat a lot of fish, it's important that i completely avoid the fish that are super high in mercury, like tuna. I asked for a roll with salmon instead of tuna. It came out, I paid no attention to it (shame on me- in my defense, there was so much going on with it, you couldn't tell unless you dug the fish out of the roll), ate over half of it, until a different waiter came over with a new roll and said \"here's the salmon roll, that one was a mistake- it had tuna\". Obviously I was upset- Mercury is VERY bad for fetuses! I asked him why didn't he tell me right away it was tuna vs letting me eat it- he ran off scared, came back, and said he was wrong, it was salmon after all. Well, i dug the fish out of the roll at this point and showed it to him, as it was obviously tuna. he took the plate back to the kitchen, came back, and insisted again that it was salmon (there was 0% chance that was salmon- not even close resemblance). He eventually took it back and had a new roll made for me (not sure where the original replacement went), but I never got so much as an explanation, or an apology. Or even a discount on the check!  Summary: the food here is good, but drive past and go to Yama if you have any food sensitivities. There is a complete lack of integrity here- the fact that I was looked in the eye and lied to twice is beyond justification.",

I know I am not the only one who experience this because a lot of people bought this deals online.

I won't go back to this restaurant because intergrity and honesty are very important otherwise their sushi is very fresh.",

I love this place and I'm not really sure why I've never done a review before. at any rate I recently moved and sushi guru is one of the places that I consistently crave so since I came back to clt I had to have it.   per usual we were seated very quickly when we arrived and were promptly served our drinks. took a few moments to decide on what we wanted and eventually settled on 2 d'originals, 1 extremely spicy tuna, and 1 hamachi jalapeno. the sushi arrived in a timely manner and was absolutely delicious. the mango in the d'original was perfectly ripe and I have always loved the sweetness that it adds to the roll along with the contrast from the spicy mayo on top (and the wasabi that I add). the hamachi jalapeno was a very fresh and light roll. the jalapeno on top was thinly sliced and added a light kick but not too much. the extremely spicy tuna was pretty spicy but very enjoyable. all in all the fish was fresher than usual and we cleaned the plate in no time flat.   we also ordered the donut roll which is usually phenomenal but today it was just average. the fruit inside the roll was a bit too tart/not ripe enough and lessened the deliciousness but it was still enjoyable.   overall I love sushi guru, can't recommend it enough, and will probably patronage them every time I visit home.",

The last time I was in, I was pregnant and couldn't eat any raw fish - they offered to make any roll of my choice with the fish fully cooked. I got the Salmon Lover Roll and loved it with the cooked salmon! I'm not the biggest fan of the sake cocktails, though I did enjoy drinking some of the flavored sakes they offer.

It's a small establishment, with well-placed tables, including some bistro tables, for maximum seating. We were seated at a bistro table by the window, but ended up sitting at the sushi bar because we decided we wanted to insert ourselves more in the ambiance.

I would highly recommended this restaurant if you are in the area. Some of the freshest sushi I have ever had.",

    "text": "Me and my boyfriend have been looking for a great sushi restaurant and YESSSS WE'VE FOUND IT! Parking is pretty packed around 7:30pm on a Friday night and It is a little small BUT the sushi is AMAZING! We were seated within seconds and we chose the bar. The entertainment was great and we haven't even ordered yet. The Chefs were really talkative and great at multi-tasking. The service was amazing and our server was really funny and knew how to sell his sushi. I Chose the GURU ROLL!   The best DAMN roll I have ever tasted! Another recommendation from the comedian server of ours was the SOUTHPARK Roll. You have to try the Guru and the South Park roll to satisfy your night. The last thing you should try IF you have room in your stomachs is the DONUT ROLL which looks like a roll but fruity and delicious! The cocktails called the Green Hornet and Watermelon was amazing. It tasted like paradise! Very clean and also a great place for family. We will be coming back! We have found our favorite sushi spot in Charlotte! And yes it does live up to the expectation of Best sushi Restaurant in Charlotte!",

My husband and I decided to try it out on a Friday night.  It wasn't very busy (which can be worrysome  - it is a Friday night!) and we were seated right away.   We started off with the salmon pizza, which was fun and tasty.  We also had the Guru Roll with lump crab.  Anything with lump crab piques my interest.  Our server was attenative and came by often.   I was glad to find someplace other than Cowfish in the area for sushi. We'll definitely be back!",

Executive Chef Cy Santos taught the class with a passion for the craft of making sushi.  He clearly explained how to make it and stressed the importance of how you need to continually practice to get better at the craft.    Many other chefs who worked at the restaurant were also available for assistance.    I made and enjoyed eating the most delicious sushi I have ever tried.  I highly recommend taking this sushi class or simply coming in to enjoy the delicious, premium quality sushi.",

There check-in desk is outside and if they're understaffed you can bet that you'll be standing there for 5-10 mins before someone notices that someone is standing out side their door.  After they finally seat you it takes another 10 mins just to get a water or drink.  After they deliver your drinks they don't ask if you'd like a starter they just ask/tell you that you're ready to order.   After the order is placed you don't see your server again until the food is delivered (hope you've had enough to drink)  After they cleared our plates it took another 10 mins to get our bill.   Again, food is great but service is not. All three experiences at this restaurant have been the same.",

My boyfriend ordered chirashidon bowl and it was huge! For this who don't know, like I didn't, it's a bowl of rice with slices of sashimi on top of it.

As I am writing this my sashimi just showed up and it looks like it has potential to be decent.   Nope.  Looks are deceiving the tuna is cut way to big, is mushy and has no taste.  The salmon has bad texture and tastes like it was previously frozen.    How do places get away with being so bad.",

Best Tip about this place: They don't offer non-alcholic beer and some other drink options, however you are allowed to go across the way to the other restaurant (Rooster's) and bring back any drinks that Sushi Guru does not offer - pretty sweet and accommodating of them!!",

The server was enthusiastic and to make things easier we just got the All Star Combo where we got to choose 4 specialty rolls and chef's choice: 16 pcs of nigiri and 9 pcs of sashimi. We had one person allergic to shellfish, so we were able to sway the chef's choices and we weren't disappointed. The only critical thing for me was the red snapper nigiri was chewy, but red snapper isn't my favorite choice anyways. We got to try the best of the basics - salmon, tuna, escolar.  We enjoyed the meal and the specialty rolls were pretty good, but not something you can't get anywhere else.  Good place for moderate priced sushi and good service!",

The instructions were great, and the environment was a lot of fun. You also get to take the bamboo sheet that you use to roll up the sushi.

I ordered my favorites: Hamachi, Spanish Mackerel, Salmon, Maguro, Uni, Scallop, and a Sushi Guro roll. The waiter returned and informed me that they were out of Uni, so I added Toro to the mix. When my plate arrived, as usual, I went straight for a piece of Hamachi. It was perfectly fresh. Next, I directed my chopsticks for a piece of Toro and realized it was very pale in color (something I've never seen in the 28 years that I have been enjoying Sushi and Sashimi). I popped the piece in my mouth and tasted something else. No, it wasn't a beautifully marbled piece of Maguro. It was more like another piece of Yellowtail (Hamachi). It didn't seem right so I placed a piece of Hamachi and a piece of the so called Toro that was served to me side by side, and low and behold, they were identical, but sliced in a different way so as the color pattern on the fish were not in the same places. When the server stopped by our table to check in to see how our food was, I informed him about (what I thought was a mix up), showed him the two \"different\" pieces of fish, he agreed with me and apologized for the sushi chef's mistake. I said I was disappointed, that it was ok, but that I wasn't going to pay the price for Toro when it actually was Hamachi. The server said he completely understood. Moments later, the lead sushi chef/co-owner, Cy, came over to our table in a huff and questioned what the problem was. I explained the issue and showed him the fish comparison. He VERY RUDELY said what he served to me was indeed Toro but Hamachi Toro. I stood my ground (in a nice way) and refused to accept his BS. Please, if there was such a thing, I would have had it before. I moved to Charlotte from the NYC Metropolitan area less than 2 years ago. I've had sashimi at some of the best Japanese Sushi/Sashimi establishments in the US and have NEVER been offered Hamachi Toro, nor have I ever seen it available on any menu before. I even went as far as googling Toro and read nothing about Hamachi, everything revolved around Magoru when it came to Toro. After Cy stomped away from our table in a bigger huff, the lovely wait person came by and actually apologized for the way our party was treated by one of the owners. We finished our plates and our drinks, paid the bill ($150+ for 2 people, each having 1 Saporo, without Toro and without tip), left a generous tip, and walked out of Sushi Guru for the last time.",

The atmosphere is small and quaint, but the food is always extremely fresh and delicious (and they can sub brown rice which some places cannot)!

    "text": "Strike One... 2 Stars.  I'm a firm believer in second chances so this won't be my only visit nor my only review.  We started with the Hawaiian Ahi Tuna.  We are huge tuna fans and love that cut of fish for a start in locations like Sullivan's (Ahi Seared Tuna) and we always start with Spicy Tuna nigiri when we eat at Room 112.  This however went horribly wrong.  I'm not sure if something was rancid, but their was the oddest taste to this app.  Pineapple was your basic thin peices that felt canned.  It was a good amount of tuna and appeared to be a great cut but the marinade made it to where we just couldn't enjoy it and only ate about 10% of it.  It was also not prepared in a way that you could enjoy multiple ingredients in one bite.  We then had the SouthPark Roll (was a special) and the Guru Roll (their signature roll).  The SouthPark Roll was advertised as having a majo drizzle of some sort, which it certainly did.  Problem was it was strong and totally overtook any other flavors.  It was a more pungent mayo than others and made the roll impossible to enjoy.  The Guru Roll was lastly a huge disappointment because it's their signature specialty roll coming in at $13.  For that pricetag I should have gone with a nigiri of some sort or a sashimi.  This was advertised as tuna, lump crab, avocado with a spicy aioli, flashed fried with fried garlic and shallots. (Will say that $1 went to a charitable cause which I liked so that was cool).  The main thing about this roll was that it was extremely basic and was overpowered by the fried shallots/garlic which in my opinion didn't belong on the roll.  I can appreciate modern interpretations and creativity with sushi, but this just didn't work.  It was like having the canned fried onion pieces, only greasier.  While many of the ingredients of both rolls were classic of the sushi most people know, the creativity actually hurt them.  When we return, we will try new rolls and a different app.  I'm truly hoping it was just a bad night.  Otherwise, I don't think this restaurant will last more than 24 months.  With Cowfish being very successful and .5 miles away, also with it set directly beside Rooster's...  and it being a pricier district.. the quality just didn't line up.",

    "text": "Went for lunch today, 2 of us out of maybe a dozen diners. A slow day. We both had the Guru bento box. The Guru roll is great and we both enjoyed them. This bento box gives you 4 pieces of their signature roll. We both ask for a substitution on the fruit (she asked for soup and I asked for a small amount of seaweed salad) and she asked for just tuna sashimi instead of the piece  of salmon and white fish that comes with the dish. Ryan told us there would be an up charge for the changes which we agreed. Before describing the up charge, let me first tell you the food was very good. Not great except the guru roll, but very good. Now for my ax to grind. The up charge was $5 for $12.50 meals. The charge didn't result in bankruptcy but it's the principle that the changes weren't that significant and the place was lucky to have a hand full of customers for a rainy Saturday lunch. Face it, you got to make a decision what to charge based on the charge, they did and I doubt we'll go back. There are too many other options for good sushi and there was no need to stick it to the few customers you got. By the way, I didn't think it was Ryan's call on the up charge, so his tip didn't suffer, albeit on the lower side our usual 20%. He was enthusiastic and personable but didn't adequately represent sticking I was going to get.",

If it is really that hard to deliver menus to a table when people enter, maybe just put menus on every table.  It's such a simple thing but when you are ducking in for a quick lunch and 5 minutes are wasted before water or a menu is delivered, it's terrible.

The rolls we ordered at Sushi Guru were $14 & $15 - definitely not worth it.  As others have mentioned, the service was very slow.  We weren't in the car very long before I got violently sick.  I had eaten a roll that my husband hadn't.  We called this restaurant to let them know, to possibly prevent others from eating what I had.  The woman who answered said that the manager told her that he was \"too busy\" to talk to us!  (This was a Tuesday night & the place was less than a third occupied.). She said he told her to get our name & phone number & he'd call tomorrow.  We were never contacted.  This says a lot about what kind of a person he is.

In another situation we would have left but I had a Groupon to use people! (I never do learn about groupons... there is a reason they are out there)... I'd love to say the sushi outshines the shabby service throughout the night, but we were disappointed.

My wife and I came in on a Thursday night and were met with courteous, quick staff and some great sushi rolls. Overall for the price compared to the experience, I think the sushi game in Charlotte is a little stronger than what this place has to offer.   You can't miss it from the street as they have a giant neon sign. When you walk in, you find yourself in a quaint shopping mall with some hallway seating and a fountain. The restaurant is just to the right. It's a relatively small place, but had a neat bar where they rolled the sushi.    When you are searching for the best Sushi, you get straight to the point and skip the appetizers. We ended up getting the spicy salmon roll, queen city roll, and guru roll. The QC roll was pretty good, but was put to shame by the guru roll. It would easily be my recommendation.  Price point was close to $15 a roll, so be prepared to spend a little bit. I found this place from the Yelp reviews, but left with just a mediocre feeling. Since service was relatively good and they do have some creative rolls, I hope to come back and try this place again one day soon.",

There are creative rolls here, which I went for since the regular rolls / hand rolls were pretty pricey. I went with and would STRONGLY recommend the Signature Combo; this consists of the famous 'Guru Roll' and 6 pieces of nigiri: tuna, salmon, yellowtail, white fish, eel, and shrimp. The fish was generous on the nigiri; unfortunately so much on the Guru Roll.  Granted the fish was very fresh and delicious, I will say that the rolls (Guru roll + Salmon Lover's) were a bit disappointing in terms of quantity. However, the service is fantastic, and adhered to my friend's request for spicy mayo as well as my request for fresh jalapeno slices (I'm Indian, can't help it). The freshness of the fish and the quality of service makes this place a solid 4-stars. I would recommend going here, but get ready to seriously spend for a filling meal!",

Didn't seem that busy, my tea was never brought out, waters stayed empty, and the guru roll never showed up. I mentioned this to the server, they apologized and I said just bring the check. No worries, stuff happens. After waiting another 10-15 minutes for the bill(I had to go ask for it again) and paying, I noticed we were charged for the guru roll. When I went up to the service counter I was told my guru roll was being packed to go. I advised I wanted this previously, and would not want it to go, and to remove from my bill. For a place with such good food and atmosphere, they could use a tuneup with the front of house.",

    "text": "Sometime last year we went to the sushi making class for date night and had a blast. We added this place to our list of restaurants to try but did not get around to it until I saw a coupon on LivingSocial which gave us the perfect excuse to go for dinner.   We arrived a little after 6:00pm and we were promptly seated. We shared the shrimp spring rolls (you get three rolls) which were hot and delicious. We decided on the Guru Roll, The Queen City Roll and the Wasabi Roll. The Guru Roll was good but a little too much garlic for a sushi roll in my opinion. The Queen City Roll was absolute perfection with a beautiful presentation and delicious combination. I don't think I have tried lobster on sushi before but I am totally sold after eating this roll! The Wasabi Roll was good too but the other two rolls were eclipsed by the scrumptious Queen City.   We decided to splurge on dessert and ordered the donut roll. This is where our experience went down a bit, over half an hour after we ordered the roll we decided we had waited long enough and cancelled our order to get the check. The waitress was very kind about it and offered to bring it out to go free of charge which was great but it took her another 15 minutes to get the check together and bring it out. We left over 45 minutes after ordering the dessert but I will say it was almost worth it when I sampled it when we got home. It has fruit inside but tastes like it was fried with donut dough and was still warm. I was very impressed with the ability to not just make sushi taste like a donut, but a yummy on at that!  I would give this restaurant a 4.5 if I could but I am always impressed when a restaurant holds itself to a high standard. We had asked to cancel the order but since it had been such a long wait the waitress took it off of the bill and I believe pushed it through to make sure we were able to bring it home and try it. I am glad she did so I will round up to a 5. We will definitely return!",

Our server was great and the sushi chef behind the bar   We ordered handrolls - spicy tuna, yellowtail scallion, and benjamin's tuna avocado. I loved all of them except the benjmains tuna avocado, it just did not taste good together for some reason.   The yazzy snazzy roll was sweet and good! Its \"yellowtail scallions with avocado and tempura flakes topped with flame seared spicy white tuna drizzled with eel sauce topped with crispy shallots, crab roe and scallions\" see the picture.   The chef did gave us several free nigiris and we ordered a bottle of their house pinot grigio (est $30) and with the additional food we received. It was just enough!

The decor was lacking, the service was VERY slow (15 min wait for a miso soup, around 40 min wait for 2 rolls - the place was busy but not overrun by people), and the prices are pretty appalling for what I got -$13 for a roll that had a sliver of jalapeno and a thin of a sliver of hamachi on top, while being like a less-than-California roll on the inside was the nail in the coffin. I will post a picture of what my roll looked like (too bad I cannot attach it to the review). Perhaps there is inconsistency in how rolls are made, and we just ended up with sub-par ones, but that would be a problem in and of itself. Consistency is key, so expectations are met.  I am Back to RuSan. Sushi Guru, you made a very bad first impression.",

On the outside, you feel like you're walking into some corny shopping plaza. Then, upon entering, it feels like some mid-century gothic village -- et al designs and flooring.   Then, in the corner, you notice Sushi Guru. Just minding its own business and waiting for you to crave sushi and sashimi. I've only ever been for lunch, but every time has been better than the last.   From the requisite house salad with ginger dressing to the simple maki, it's a home run every time. Service is great and the prices are always rather fare. Upon my most recent visit, a colleague and I opted for one of the lunch platters, as well as a few additional maki rolls. Of worthy note were the spicy tuna (good amount of heat) and the softshell crab roll. Goodness gracious that was one flavorful roll of sushi. The presentation couldn't have been more spectacular with all of the crunchy crab posed as if it were crawling out of the rice and nori. I loved it.   Definitely one of my favorite options for sushi and sashimi in Crown Town. Looking forward to many more visits.",

I've had three very poor experiences in each of my last three visits, where the food has taken anywhere from 1 to 1:45mins to arrive.  Simple inexcusable for what should be a fast service sushi joint.  For instance this evening, I ordered a sashimi appetizer and a sashimi combo for dinner.  No rolls, nothing fancy, and walked out 1:10 minutes after arriving with still no entree.

I had to contain myself from ordering one of everything!  It's a small little place tucked away in the shopping center across the street from Southpark mall and located alongside Rooster's. When you enter, you step into this open courtyard area with the restaurant entrance to the right. It's pretty small on the inside. When my friend and I went early on a Saturday evening, we were able to choose our on seating.   I went with the orange crush (which was one of the drink specials that night) for my cocktail, edamame for an app, and went with the guru roll based on the raves found here on yelp. The cocktail and edamame were all right but the guru roll was the True star. Heaps of flavor and deliciousness.   I know, if you're in the area and craving sushi, Cowfish is the spot du jour for the area but I STRONGLY SUGGEST stopping into Sushi Guru because most likely Cowfish will have a ridiculous wait time. At Sushi Guru you'll be met with inventive and delicious sushi rolls.",

The only reason I even know this place exists is because of Living Social. And, I'm here to tell you that is a damn shame! Where has Sushi Guru been hiding my whole life? Oh, that's right... Inside the weird shopping mall/foyer/breezeway thingy behind Roosters. I mean, seriously. Could they find a more random location?   Anyhow, I am SO excited to have discovered this sushi gem. (Thanks, Living Social!) We had the avocado tuna salad to start. Presented in a fun martini glass, the tuna was super fresh and plentiful. The sesame ginger dressing it was all tossed in was very tasty. I'd buy bottles of the stuff to take home if they'd sell it to me. After that, we shared the Bonsai and Guru roll. Both were delicious and beautifully presented but the Guru was the clear favorite. When we go back -- oh, we will be back and often at that -- I think the Guru will be the stand-by order and the 2nd roll will rotate until we can try them all and discover another favorite.   Since this first visit, we've fallen in love with the sushi pizza! They've also started offering specials/features which are pretty amazing, too. Last week we had Haiwaiian bluefin tuna sashimi that was out of this world!!   My only caution is that the rolls are a little on the pricey side (@$12-16 per roll for the speciality ones) for sushi. This is no Ru-Sans or Sushi 101, price-wise, but the flavor, freshness and quality are well worth the few extra dollars per roll.",

My waiter did kindly state after 30min that they are running a little behind. After receiving my rolls, they were what I would call \"different\" but still very good. Fortunately I was not on a time schedule, but the wait was very disappointing considering that the restaurant was not very busy.",

I recently went on a date here, both my date and I consider ourselves \"foodies\". I'm giving them two stars simply b/c the hostess was friendly and inviting, my waitress was super attentive, and we liked the setup/decor. However, you come to restaurants to eat...we started with a seaweed salad and crab dumplings...the seaweed salad was underwhelming and mostly lettuce at the bottom of the bowl, and my dumplings were bland...probably because it looked like imitation crab meat.   We proceeded to order 6 rolls...and besides the \"Guru Roll\" we were super unsatisfied with the quality of the seafood.... When we expressed this to my waiter she told us prior customers said the food smelled or tasted alittle to fishy...not in a good way \") My date was so embarrassed he said \"I could've taken you to Harris Teeter across the street for better sushi than this\" ...  And even after we complained...we were both shocked they didn't even try to accommodate us with maybe a dessert or drink....  Needless to say Sushi Guru is not what I'm used to in quality or taste when it comes to sushi...they do have an extensive menu..maybe they should focus on quality instead of quality....",

The waitress we got ( girl who looks like a man) ignored us once we got the food, which was not bad at all, and possibly the only positive thing about the restaurant.

August is a big month for our family and we are always looking for new small business to support! I'm so glad that we choose them to kick off the month of festivities!   Definitely check them out!

After that, 5 mins prob passed and we knocked on the door. Still...nothing...so we left.   I would've gladly appreciated someone at least greeting us and telling us they needed more time or something and we would've waited since we adore the food. I even considered driving to the one in Plaza but they don't open to 1pm and I would be livid if this happened again.   I will say that I'll be back for the food since it's hard to find good sushi here but please, update your hours online and on your doors if you aren't planning to open as intended.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place out for a while and since my wife and I were in the area, we thought we would go ahead and do so. There are other restaurants in the area, but most were really busy and this place was not.  We walked in and were greeted by 2 people up front, they were very nice and pleasant. The place was empty (should have been a red flag). We were seated and placed our drink orders. Our drinks came, but we were still looking over the menu. We finally decided what we wanted, but our server was taking a long time to come back over. She was in deep conservation with other employees. She finally made it back over, almost at the point where we were going to leave due to the wait. We were so frustrated that it was taking so long, since the place was empty.   We placed our appetizer orders and our sushi orders. Normally, my wife and I start with one roll each and then place additional orders after we have finished. I order a salad and the tempura roll, she ordered a squid salad and the cucumber roll (forget the actual name). Our salads came out fairly quick. But once again, the minutes ticked by before our rolls came out. At this point, there were a few more patrons there, but our order still went in before theirs. The amount of waiting took us right out of the mood and it was really hard to enjoy this place. Even the server could feel our vibe changed. To the point, we didn't want to order anything else, as we were fearful that it would take forever.   The food was good, but the prices were too high for what you got in return and the wait time was terrible. Not to mention that when our server could see something was off with us, she didn't even try to rectify the situation. Even when we paid and left, she made eye contact with me and didn't say a word. Not that it really mattered at that point, as we already decided mid-meal that we would never go back. It was one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant and I'm really shocked that other reviews are so high. Maybe it was an off night.",

For starters we ordered the Crispy Calamari and Sashimi Pizza for the table: both tasted soooo fresh! The Crispy Calami comes with Wasabi Tartar Sauce, do not fear, the tartar sauce was not spicy!  For the Sashimi Pizza, you can chose either fresh tuna or salmon.  For my entree, I ordered the Fujisan roll, it had lump crab, avocado and fuji apples!  It was beautiful and absolutely wonderful!    I was surprised that they had plenty of empty tables on a Saturday night.  Even though they weren't that busy, the service was a tad on the slow side. However, the food more than made up for the slow service.",

Our sushi was way better this time and allowed me to upgrade my previous review to 3 stars. Sushi is still a little pricey for lack of ambiance and location in a strip mall.

The sushi is some of the freshest I have had in Charlotte and they have an extensive list of amazing appetizers as well as some sushi rolls, standard and restaurant specialities.  One of my favorites is the Hamachi and jalapeno ...so good. This location has a small sushi bar with two dining areas as well as outside seating. Unfortunately service can be hit or miss, as things get hectic, but everyone is so sweet and I look forward to every visit. If you're in the area and like sushi, this is your spot!",

    "text": "Simple. Common. Pricey. Standard.   I've lived in Charlotte for almost 4 years now and my husband and I eat sushi at least once a week... We're pretty spoiled, we know that, but we love sushi. Some how we missed noticing that sushi guru was located right in South Park. The location is kind of tucked away.   We ordered seaweed salad and veggie dumplings to start and they were pretty standard starters. The seaweed salad didn't have that amazing lasting taste or tartness that most do, and the dumplings seemed fried on one side and were slightly burned, not steamed at all.   We got tree hugger rolls which were the only vegan rolls on the menu and substituted tofu in another roll we split. Substituting wasn't easy and there was an up charge... Not cool if I'm substituting tofu in for fish because fish is more expensive than tofu.   I'm not sure I would go back, but the food wasn't bad so if we needed some quick sushi I might order Postmates. The restaurant service/experience wasn't amazing or anything to rave about.",

Will be back for more!!",

One order of the Jalapeno Hamachi roll and my craving is cured.  It has a citrus sauce and sesame seeds, seriously I cannot step foot in SG without ordering one. I just want to yell it when I walk in, like they yell at Five Guys. \"SINGLE BURGER!\"  The main reason Sushi Guru is my favorite, the rice is warm and the fish is room temperature. I hate a cold bite and sometimes even at the nicest, fanciest place serve cold rolls. \"GO CHECK IT OUT!\"",

After waiting a few minutes, wondering if the restaurant was even open (1:45 pm), a waiter finally seated me.  Surprisingly, this place was very small...and not all that impressive aesthetically.  Think maybe it may be nicer if seated in the corridor (hallway?).  Anyway, per suggestion from a friend, I tried the Guru Roll...along with an order of Fried Calamari.  The Guru Roll was delicious...as expected.  What was more impressive was the Fried Calamari...which came out in a bowl, with mini-sized, Japanese-style Calamari!  By that, I mean perfectly battered and fried...not at all greasy, but more crispy.  In all, the meal was very satisfying...and I'd definitely give this place 2 thumbs up.  Pisces is still my favorite Japanese restaurant in town, but this definitely makes my Top 5.",

Ok, have I tried all the sushi in Charlotte? Well, no. But I have been to Japan many times, and when I came to Charlotte about 13 years ago I went to about 10 or so places here, and they were all, you know, fine. What's not to like? It's sushi, right? Even ok sushi is good...  Well, then I came here. And I figured \"cool, I don't have to settle for \"ok\" sushi anymore.\"  Then a few friends said I should branch out and try a few other new places. So I did. And it was the same \"okay ness\".  So I came back here. It's like going to Sapporo. Or Kyoto. Or Tokyo. It's just right.",

We had a veggie poke bowl, tree hugger roll and sauteed veggies. All dishes were tasty and the portions were just right. I think they have an opportunity to add some cool vegetarian dishes at this place, and I hope they do!   The reason for 3 stars is mainly because the whole first floor blows air condition right outside through their garage style doors. While I'm sure someone thought this indoor/outdoor vibe would be cool, it's extremely wasteful. Open the doors when you're not blowing air condition! Save money too!",

    "text": "It is difficult to find truly amazing sushi in Charlotte. In fact, I'm not sure you can find it. However, there is plenty of pretty good sushi here, and Sushi Guru is in the top three. Of the top three, it is my favorite because it is the most unpretentious and laid back. There are now two locations of Sushi Guru. This is about the original SouthPark location.  The service is slow as can be. Allow over an hour for lunch.  The interior decor of this location is very underwhelming. It is dark and plain. They have outdoor seating, but it is basically in a parking lot and expect to wait even longer for service outside. In other words, I would never suggest that anyone sit outside here.   With the caveats that the service is slow, the interior is old (not in a good way), and that you should not sit outside, this is a great place. Let me tell you why. The sushi rolls are uniformly very good. The fish seems fresh. Some of the sushi rolls, like the South Park roll, are particularly good. The service, while slow, is very friendly.   And there is something charming about the plain atmosphere and interior. The other two best sushi places in Charlotte are Baku and Cowfish. Baku, while a favorite of mine, is overly trendy and expensive - great for a date night but not an every day place. Cowfish is little kid central because of the burgers and location, I guess. So quiet Sushi Guru tends to be the one that I actually most want to eat at on a regular basis. It is relatively cozy and laid back, so therefore good for work discussions or relaxing.   Oh, but also don't get the miso soup. It is like dishwater.",

(Which was strange because we called 5 mins prior)   After I mentioned I called and was told 5 mins ago there was no wait, she brought us to our table. She was nice about it, but it was odd. There were plenty of tables open.   The waitress we had seemed very \"New\". Wasn't very suggestive at all. Sushi was decent. Nothing too special. Maybe we didn't order the best rolls.   There are a lot of sushi choices though and I believe this place has potential.",

Also got the pork dumplings which were very good, and the edamame (meh - wouldn't bother).  My husband got the hamachi jalapeno roll, which was good, but not as good as the wasabi roll.  Very tight space, and I suspect the waitress didn't actually like sushi, but the service was fine.  They don't have a kids menu so if you have very young children, I wouldn't recommend.  Probably would be a great lunch place and I anticipate us getting a lot of takeout from here.",

The place is small and lacked any type of ambiance but if the food is good, that can be overlooked at a place. Our server was attentive and spot on, which was really the only reason to award 2 stars.  The rolls are your typically prices, with a cheaper side of the menu and a pricier side with $ 12 -18 rolls. The drinks however were quite pricy and they were not doing any specials. I opted not to spend $5 on a beer and instead just got two rolls. The sushi wasn't bad but nothing special... here's where the 'I'll never go there again' claim comes in. We watched the fireworks, grabbed a few drinks and went home. I ended up getting physically sick that night and my guy asked how much I drank... seeing how I had two beers before we retired, I knew it had nothing to do with alcohol. And I would have brushed it off if it wasn't for my guy getting sick later on in the night. And my calling my friend Krysten and her telling me, yep I threw up as well... all 3 of us had the shrimp tempura roll so it was easy to ID the culprit. I know this doesn't happen to everyone but I wasn't impressed with the place beforehand anyway and the food poisoning of course sealed the deal.",

We ended up sitting outside since the weather was perfect. The service was horribly slow. While we were sitting there we saw a couple go in and about 15 minutes later walk out with the manager chasing after them apologizing that no one had come to take their orders.  I got the Guru Roll and while it was good...the only thing I could taste was the garlic. This place is way over priced as well. Our bill came out to over $80 for a salad, two rolls and two drinks.   Save yourself the hassle and just walk next door to Rooster's.",

I used to go when it was Cyros and was a little bummed when they closed. But I'm glad they came back with a new name but the same menu, especially the Hamachi Jalapeno Roll.  The Omakase is a cool way to let the sushi chef show you the freshest fish of the day.  Its kind of small so might be busy around dinner time, but there are normally seats open at the sushi bar. Like most sushi places the check can escalate quickly, but Sushi Guru is worth every penny.",

I have to say it was some of the most amazing Sushi I have ever had.  The chef (owner) at the bar Cy was very helpful and the Sushi chefs working with him were funny and very conversational, which was exactly what I was looking for.  Cy made a special salad for me that wasn't even on the menu and was even better than what I asked for! I can't say enough good things about this place. Small (quaint) seating area but it gives a very intimate feel to the place.  I had the Southpark roll, the Hamachi Jalapeno roll and the Guru roll.  All three were amazing in flavor, although, of the three, the Hamachi was my least favorite.   I highly recommend this place and I will definitely come back the next time I am in town.  Thank you Cy for an amazing experience and I can't wait to see you guys next time. Oh and by the way the waitress was great, never left my glass empty and stopped by just the right amount of times to check on me.",

My boyfriend and I came to Charlotte from columbia and were looking for a different eating experience while we were here; something to tie up our excellent trip. Searching on yelp we first found cowfish. When we arrived however, there was a 2 and a half hour wait - I kid you not! We then found sushi guru and decided to check it out. I am a huge sushi fan and was definitely looking forward to it.  This place did not disappoint. When we arrived, there was a short wait (45 minutes) but hey, it was a Saturday night. Our hostess promptly came out and let us know there were two seats available at the bar if we wanted to be seated there. Of course we accepted and from tere, the experience got better by the minute.  The menu is perfectly created and written so you know exactly what you'll be ordering. Although the decision between the Caribbean roll, guru roll, or dynamite roll proved to be a challenge, we were able to choose.  We ordered an appetizer of veggie gyoza, which was amazing!!! My boyfriend is vegan and he was pleased to see options like this. I ordered the South Park roll. It was perfectly cooked and was an absolute pleasure to consume. My boyfriend got the tree-hugger and Caribbean roll. They were as perfect as sushi can get.  When our meal was finished, the owner of the store came and spoke to us. We let him know how impressed we were and he was very gracious. It was nice to have someone besides the waitress making sure our meal wasn't a disappointment. After that, the chefs behind the counter asked us questions about why we came to Charlotte and were very friendly and funny.  This restaurant all around was a great experience. I will definitely be back as soon as possible!",

We stood around the front of the restaurant for about 10 minutes and nobody came to greet us or seat us. Finally some guy that was eating his lunch on the terrace part came and told us we can sit where ever we wanted. We sat down and waited and waited...  We saw one of the servers chatting away (for about 20 min) with one of the customers at their table.  Finally another 15 min later, a different server came out of the back and said \"sorry I will be right back with a menu\" another 5 minutes later she finally bought us menus and took our drink order.  We were so hungry at this point we chose right away what we wanted to eat and ordered with the server when she bought us our waters.  My friend ordered a spicy tuna roll and another roll and I had the Salmon lover and Negi hamachi roll.  By the time we ordered, the restaurant was all empty leaving my friend and I with only one other table (who had already finished eating and were having a meeting)  tick tock tick tock....  2:30pm rolls around still no food. We could NOT understand why 4 little rolls were taking so long to make because obviously we were the only table who have not eaten yet. And the whole hour we waited, none of the servers stopped by to refill our water or to tell us why the food was taking so long.   Finally around 2:45pm we got our 4 rolls. Still No apology or explanation why it took so long.  The rolls tasted whatever. Definitely NOT worth waiting an hour to get our food.   Stay away!! Horrible Horrible service. Will NOT be returning.",

I asked him to please place the order of the pork and mushroom dumplings in as a dinner (I do not eat seafood). He told me he would and the next thing I know... I get everything all at once. Meanwhile, my friend ordered a salad to start with and it never came out. After waiting some time we reached out to our waiter (who was chatting with the hostess for a long time). After getting his attention we asked him about my friend's salad. He looked us straight in the face and said no, when it is ready he'd bring it out. He didn't even bother to check. It's a salad. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure this out. We waited a very long time for her salad. Meanwhile, I'm done with my soup, edamame and dumplings.   I just can't wrap my head around the expense of this place with such an inexperienced server. He didn't know what we were drinking and food was not coming out at the right times. We had creme brulee for dessert and their was barely any sugar. No cracking of sugar in my spoon!  I don't know... I was left feeling extremely disappointed. I only gave the place a 2 star rating because the food was genuinely good and my friend loves the place. If I didn't know it was good for her, I'd give them a 1. Very disappointed",

We enjoyed all three but I have to say their Cali roll stood out! It was super fresh and probably one of the best I've had. Their rice was a bit softer than your average sushi rice (making it difficult to pick-up) but the taste was fabulous.   The Guru roll tasted very familiar ...that's because it's the same thing as the Press roll (turns out they supply the sushi there too). I would bet that their crunchy roll and their fujisan  roll is the same  too (and perhaps others). I like these rolls but I wish they were a bit more creative and came up with something new and unique to this location. They also forgot our salad but were super friendly so I can't fault them too much on the service side. Next time i'd forgo the salad as it was iceberg bag mix...not a favorite of mine.   My total came to $13 for my half ...very reasonable for a filling fresh- sushi lunch. I will absolutely come back and try some of their other special rolls...hopefully ones I haven't tried already at Press.",

I had the Fujisan, an eel and Fuji apple roll with eel sauce and the sweetness and the crunch were perfection.  It truly made my mouth water.    My husband opted for the Omakase, a one of a kind meal where the chef comes out and asks you your likes and dislikes and creates you a signature meal.  From the mango-tuna salad to the amazingly freshly mussels (best we've ever had in Charlotte) to the salmon tartare, my dear hubby was pleased with everything that came on his plate.    Beyond that, the service was wonderful, and everyone was truly kind and helpful.  The chef even came and talked with us for awhile after our amazing dinner.  Too many sushi bars in Charlotte go for the fast and loud attitude, but Sushi Guru is opposite and in the very best way.  Laid back and quiet, it's a great place to have a meal with friends and actually hear the conversation.   This will be our go-to sushi place from here on out.  I look forward to trying all the other unique and wonderful rolls on their menu!",
