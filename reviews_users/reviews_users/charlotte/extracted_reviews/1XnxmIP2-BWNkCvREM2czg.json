    "text": "I love me some Cracker Barrel! I haven't mastered the art of cooking a good meatloaf, so when I have the craving I look for a Cracker Barrell. I'm so glad they opened this location, because I had to drive all the way up to Concord Mills exit to get my fix before.   The service hasn't really improved since the opening week. For some reason there is always a problem getting my drink here. I think I throw the server off when I order my food and drink at the same time? Last time the server came back to ask if we wanted some bread while we waited for food, and I responded with \"well, not really, but I would LOVE to have my water while I wait\". LOL! He apologized and ran with some great speed to grab our water.   There does seem to be a good 30 minute wait between ordering and getting my food no matter what I order. Hopefully that will eventually speed up soon.   The parking lot always seems to be full and often there is a wait. The turn around on tables seems to be pretty speedy though, so that is good. Haven't had to wait more than 20 mins to be seated yet, even when I was told the wait would be 45 minutes.   This is actually the second CB I've seen not directly off the Interstate. We had one back in Athens, GA.. which has no interstate nearby.. good 30 minute drive to I-85. These non-interstate CB's must be popping' up due to high demand, which seems to be the case here..   I gave 4 stars.. but it's more like 3.5. I'll return often for my meatloaf cravings! yay!",

As usual, one exits the dining area into the store to pay for dinner.  There was no line formed therefore my husband stood to the left of the paying customer.  As he waited for that customer to complete his transaction, other diners exited the dining room and stood to the right of the paying customer.  When my husband stepped up to pay, the cashier refused to accept his bill stating that he needed to step to the back of the line.  Even after other customers repeatedly informed her that he was there first, she refused his attempts to pay.  Her behavior was discriminatory and quite embarrassing to other customers.  My family of four will never return again.",

I ate the two eggs, the two turkey sausage patties and half of a biscuit.  Mind you this came with grits, gravy, apple butter, hash brown casserole, two biscuits, two eggs, and two sausage patties.... HUGE breakfast.   I loved the apple butter! The biscuits were good, the gravy interesting, grits not sure about those things yet, sausage good, and eggs... well they are eggs.   The coffee was good and the water tasted just fine.   Not sure whether or not to visit again, but if I do, the apple butter for sure will be on my plate!   And yes, they accept AMEX.",

I looked around to find a manager standing there jaw jacking with a server.   Now, my table was the closest table to where they were standing. To look around a busy restaurant and find a Manager standing around flapping his gums, is unexceptable. Having to ask him if someone could take our drink order didn't even spur him into action. Well he did catch someone walking by and ask them to do it.  Nice deligation dork! How about doing something besides hold the floor down?!   Other than a laxidasical approach to Mgmt, things were good. Service was good once she arrived. She checked on us multiple times. The food was as good as pancakes and eggs could be.  I just don't like to see the leader standing around while everone else is busting their butt. Poor Management.",

All of our pancakes came out extremely tough (tougher than a well prepared steak) . The kids had already started eating, so we asked that only our pancakes be remade. We were going to keep our eggs and sides, until my husband took a bite of his eggs and ate an egg shell. So she stated they would remake those as well. Our remake took another 20 minutes to come out, when it came back out, our pancakes were still tough, tasted as though they never remade the batter, just used the same over mixed batter. They actually remade the wrong breakfast because I never received the 3 pieces of meat, my eggs didn't have Colby cheese, and no hash brown casserole. The rest of my meal came back out about 5 minutes later, and the eggs were AWFUL! They looked as though they re-used the same eggs that were on the plate when they brought out our remake, dumped cheese on top, and put them in the microwave, there was no cheese cooked into the eggs, all of the cheese just on top. The eggs were not fluffy like my husbands either but very dense. The waitress came back out and I told her of my concern, and she immediately became defensive. If you are looking for less than mediocre breakfast, then by all means go here!",

What they hey, I figured, and down 74 I went.  When I arrived, I was somewhat surprised to find that one must walk through a strange little store to get to the dining room.  I say \"strange\" because I couldn't detect any kind of Cracker Barrel theme: it was a fairly random assortment of clothes, candles, food, and toys.  Do they really sell enough of this stuff to diners to make the venture worthwhile? Or perhaps some people, upon needing a new blouse or lavendar-scented candle, just stop by CB during their errands.  Anyways, I digress.  Once we were seated, service was attentive and very friendly.  It was the middle of the weak, so I behaved myself and got the grilled catfish platter with three veggie sides.  The veggies were all really good, actually, but the catfish itself was slightly oily and muddy-tasting, as inexpertly handled catfish tends to be.  I am sure that their specialties, however, are the mouth-watering meatloaves and casseroles that I saw others eating.  If I return, I will have to resign myself to the calories and try those.  Oh yeah, the server brings you your receipt, and then you take it into the store to pay.  The cashier will try to convince you to buy whatever knick knack they're pushing this month.  Be strong!",

Really a good option b/c when you look at the kids menu, by the time you add it all up, you get so much less and at around the same price.  I love anything that contains country ham.  Also they do make omlettes, they just aren't on the menu.  You have to ask.  This location has the best hashbrown casserole.  I've been to just about every Cracker in the area and this is the good stuff.  I've never had an issue with the service here and we go to this one weekly.    The store has great sales right after holidays.  I got the cutest little ladybug costume for my little girl for next year for like 10 dollars - more than 50% off!

When I finally got settled in Charlotte, I decided, it's high time I check out a Cracker Barrel! So I did. The decor was just how I'd imagine it, real kitschy. We were seated immediately and brought a plate of bread before we ordered. Awesome. We placed our orders and right before our entrees came two different waiters came by with more bread. At this point, we had 3 plates of bread on our table. A little ridiculous. The biscuits were good but the corn biscuit or whatever tasted funny, maybe I'm just not accustomed to that taste. Anyway, our server was friendly and good about getting our food out in a timely manner, but super slow in bringing us the check. The food itself was typical Southern fare and most of the it was rather enjoyable. I had the catfish platter, which was a bit too oily for my liking. But the sides were in general very tasty. Although, the Fried Apples just looked like canned pie filling. I think I enjoyed the little game they had at the table the most.   This is just one of those places you go, just to say you've been. At least for this city slicker. If I come more often, I know one of my arteries will harden over.",

My Mom's very hard sweet potato was replaced without question, but then she was surprised by a chunk of Jack's beanstalk in her green beans (see picture for comparison to normal-sized green bean). My oven-fried chicken breast was dry -- possibly a leftover from lunch (we arrived at 4pm). The check was delivered right after food was served, and the server nicely told us that there was no rush. Unfortunately, service by both waitresses (a second had delivered the food) all but ceased after the check was on the table. It took multiple attempts to get the attention of the servers, but they did eventually see our raised hands and refilled our coffee. Also, it took three requests to obtain two extra corn bread muffins. If a Cracker Barrel manager reads this, I would simply suggest that servers continue to pay attention to customers throughout the meal. No need to hover -- just use some common sense to check on us until we're out the door, please.",

Ordered Chicken Fried Steak and Chicken Fried Chicken both solid dishes at The Barrel. Guess what, we were delivered both meals NAKED as they had RUN OUT OF SAUSAGE GRAVY! Oh and those usually savory sweet carrots, they had been on the back burner ALL DAY and were now only tasteless orange mush.   Say what, a southern restaurant chain out of sausage gravy suggesting that they were substituting brown gravy?   After pitching a fit, they made some white gravy to accompany our meal.  Service was friendly but only \"adequate\" as she couldn't keep our drinks full?   No manager in sight, damage done and moving the Independence location to the NEVER \"do over\" list...",

While the food was fine the portions were tiny and we never got refills or anything else we needed. Painfully bad. Bathrooms were also dirty which is a serious offense for a CB. I complained to the manager on duty but didn't walk away with much confidence that they will work to correct. This location has some work to do.",

    "text": "Giving 5 stars here. Rare for me.Likely would get 4, which is still a Gr8 rating.  They R getting 5 simply due 2great food & great customer service.  Prices r a bit high for breakfast, but GR8 4 dinner. This isnt your local diner food. Its eating in grandmas kitchen, well worth a buck or 2 more.  Extensive menu, breakfast lunch or dinner. daily specials. Grandma's home cooked type meals.  For me a 4 star review because they do seem 2screw up orders more often then they should whether eating in or taking out. If U get Meatloaf, why is it sometimes a huge slab & other times its half the size?Ditto for their sides.Sometimes U  get a huge side order portions, sometimes U get a baby <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fones.No&s=06514ea09e9eabae6e57a0fd5458cc92006e13d01529600966c3bc6a4104704b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ones.No</a> different w/any item,breakfast, lunch or dinner or side item.   Frustrating to order XXXX w/3 sides of xxxx, xxx and xxx, & U just never know if ur getting the same size portions, of the exact meal(s) U always get just a few days ago/or today...whether eating in or eating out. If this occurs, which is more often then I would like, how do u explain why1 kids xxx is twice the size of others, same age, same order? Easy to deal w/if eating in, but vry hard if its a takeout, which for several people is several bags of food & plenty of room to screw up, leaving kids upset cause his/hers is more then theirs, when it should be the same.  Regardless, whether eating in or takeout, or breakfast lunch or dinner, the food is always gr8. many, many meals, covering their entire menu have been eaten and enjoyed by myself & my own family as I got older.  They could almost throw any price on any item, and while you may not like the price, you will love the food....No matter what it is, its as good as sitting in grandmas kitchen.  Loaded breakfasts are extensive, hard to navigate/figure out what you want due to the large and extensive items available. Similar for lunch and dinner, but lunch an dinner are still easier to navigate.  The 4 stars I say it deserves is based on one thing as stated above...When you order xxxx with sides of xxx, xxx and xxx, it will vary greatly sometimes. They are a chain. You'd think it would be easy to ensure 1 serving of xxx is going to be close every time or sides of xxx, xxx, or xxx will also be very close in proportion each time. Thats not the case many times and no, I do not understand why. I know the food will always be good, but I dont get the large variances in the proportions they serve. Thats why I would say 4 stars..or maybe even 3.5 cause lets face it, if you order the exact same items time after time, and while you know it will be good, you shouldnt be left wondering why you got twice the size of meatloaf or any item, then you did the last time.  The reason they are getting 5 stars is cause again, the food is great. And while its frustrating to get the same food items that always vary greatly in proportion, the customer service makes up for it. Many times, eating in, after food is delivered, we are all happy...dont say a word. No need to. But the server will look down and say 'Hmm, thats a smaller slab of meatloaf...a smaller portion of this, that or whatever..then you should have gotten..Im going to take care of it'...and she comes back with extra xxx, xxx etc....And take in to account, we were happy and content...didnt say a word, wasnt going to say a word...perfectly happy...ready to eat, nary a single complaint.....Yet without saying a word, the server notices it and is back with xtra xxx, xxx or xxx.....  How many places do this? Not many. Heck, most places even if you did complain, it would be like pulling teeth and likely get you nowhere...Here, while I notice my meatloaf is smaller then last time or my potatos, greens, anything at all is smaller then last time...Im happy...My family is happy...we are ready to eat...no need to say a word....Yet the server looks & says 'you should have gotten more meatloaf then that...you should have gotten more xxx or xxx...I'll be back..'...& before we can even say 'hey, dont worry about it..its all good..we are fine'...she (or he) is gone & then back with more food.  So, with great food, & that type of service, how can this not deserve 5 stars? Typically, I & my family do not do lunch here unless on the road..If on the road, its the first sign we look for as again, terrific food, impossible to not be happy with & they smartly locate themselves directly off of hwy exits. On the road...easy in, easy out for grandmas home cooking. Hard to beat.   This particular location is like a g-dsend. All the years of only getting to enjoy CB if ur on the road...I, my family and anybody I/we know have always said/asked..'why dont they open spots we can enjoy everyday, if we arent travelling down the hwy'.   Thankfully they listened, at least here in my area.   And grandmas cooking is now only a couple miles away.   I highly rec CB, but be prepared, especially with breakfast, U will have a hard time deciding but whatever you decide will be worth every penny & then some!",

Seated immediately ,waited 5 minutes before any waiter or waitress came, the manager stopped by and asked if we had been helped when we said no he got a waiter who took our order ,the waiter came back with our coffee, but no place settings. wife went and asked for them. Then we sat there waiting while other people who had came in after us had their meal and we were still waiting for ours, ( this was embarrassing people looking at us as if something was wrong). finally got up and asked for the manager and explained the situation to him he apologized and at that time our meals arrived and the manager said he would pick up our bill for our inconvenience. by this time we were to upset to eat a meal after being embarrassed by all this.  went to IHOP great service there",

The service is impeccable and super friendly every time that I go whether it is for breakfast, dinner, or carry-out. My personal favorite for dinner is the chicken and dumplings, roast beef dinner, or meatloaf. They are all so yummy and you get SO much for for such a low price. All of the breakfast choices are great as well. I love the cheese potato casserole. I also love that they will poach your eggs for you. Same greatness you would expect from cracker barrel without the bustling interstate nearby!",

    "text": "This new Cracker Barrel opened recently in Charlotte on Independence.   It's the first one I've seen in the area that's not off a major interstate.    Cracker Barrel has good breakfast options (although nothing fancy), so we decided to give them a try on Sunday morning.  For 9:30 a.m., it was surprisingly packed!  Usually crowds don't start for brunch until after church lets out in Charlotte.  Apparently there are many heathens out there besides us.  With the amount of cars overflowing from the parking lot and standing around indoors, our wait was only 15-20 minutes, as promised.    While we waited for our table, we walked around their country store filled with...well, country stuff...and also old-fashioned candy treats.  With the crowd waiting, it was difficult to maneuver around, but we managed until our name was called.    Once inside, we got excellent service.  Our server was very attentive, stopping by every few minutes to make sure my coffee cup never got empty.  My usual breakfast option (\"The Old Timer\") beckoned to me, so I ordered that.  Eggs, cheesy hashbrown casserole, and a choice of meat.  Not to mention biscuits (ask for apple butter!) and grits.  It's a very filling breakfast, and the coffee they serve is delicious.    After we ate, I grabbed some Chick-O-Sticks and Clark's Teaberry gum (my favorite as a kid) in the store for the road.",

We have eaten here numerous times and as of lately it is a bit of an hit and miss thing.  Sometimes the food is great and you leave satisfied and other times it is just okay.  I asked for my turkey bacon to be crispy and when it arrived limp I asked for it to be cooked some more and I was told that it wasn't possible to make turkey bacon crispy (the problem with that is that I eat turkey bacon all the time so I know that you can make it crispy)  I was pretty dissapointed with that.

    "text": "I came to this area on a business trip two days ago and wanted to try the famous Cracker Barrel while on a short break. I walked through the gift shop to the host's stand, where a sign said to wait for the host to seat me. So I waited. And waited. At least 3 full minutes passed. It was a bit busy inside, but I could see plenty of open tables, and several groups left as I waited. It was like I was invisible. I know southerners don't like pushy outsiders, so I remained quiet and relaxed. A wait person walked past me from the dining room/kitchen area and through the gift shop, walking away from the kitchen and, I can only assume, heading outside. I silently waited some more.   An elderly couple had now joined me. Another wait staff exited the kitchen, walked past the growing crowd of us and through the gift shop, away from customers, also not looking at us. Soon a woman entered, pushing a companion in a wheelchair, and joined us, waiting a few minutes more. She was the one to finally speak up and politely ask the gift shop's cashier if there was a host on duty. \"Yes\" came her short reply, not even turning her head. At that moment, another wait staff, the third separate one I laid eyes on after well over 5 minutes of silently waiting to be acknowledged, walked past the 5 of us, just the like previous 2, through the gift shop.   With that, I turned to the cashier and in a cheerful, loud voice and with a friendly smile, said my first word since entering: \"Goodbye!\" She didn't look or even register that she heard me. The folks behind me laughed and the woman pushing the wheelchair said \"Right!?!\" I walked out to my car and went to a nearby drive thru, miserable. Thanks, Cracker Barrel. Now I know what you really should be known for is miserable staff and no respect for the public. I'll never waste another minute in one of your restaurants ever again.",

The fried apples, French toast, eggs, hashbrown casserole and white toast was so good, lots of food, delicious biscuits and everything tasted good. Only took one star off for the country ham which was super dry.",

I was trying to be good by getting the grilled chicken and expected it to be meh but OMG they were so tender and flavorful and juicy.  Better than prob the fried chicken! The hash brown casserole is always a hit and I am glad they offer it all day, it is the side I never ever switch up.  The green beans were seasoned perfectly and I had some the next day for lunch and they were even better.  Husband had chicken fried chicken and it was superb. I like the chicken fried steak a bunch too.  For breakfast their pancakes are soooo good.  Good service and I was glad the sales people in the store didn't push product in an annoying way that I have seen in the past.  Always a hit for breakfast lunch or dinner!!!",

With the exception of a few that are right to left where most are left to right, they are as cookie cutter as they can possibly become. The only thing that might possibly be different about this one is that it's not on an Interstate highway. They are usually within a quarter mile of an exit. Odd.  Otherwise, same hostess, same menu, same food, same service. I'm a fan.  They've recently introduced some slightly healthier options. Though the portions remain the same - massive. I had the granola pancake breakfast, which comes with two eggs (scrambled, please) and a meat (turkey sausage seemed like the best choice) and a plate that had three ginormous pancakes that were over the edge. And two bottles of maple syrup. I was hungry, so I did manage to eat a good bit. But there was still enough left to feed a homeless person for a week.",

We came in on Wednesday night at 6pm there  was no wait we were sat immediately and it was not busy we sat right by the entrance there was never a wait the restaurant was pretty empty. There were 6 of us 3 adults and 3 children they were out of crayons ok so 3 Super bored children, the waitress took our drink order and which took a while to get then we placed our order and waited with 3 hungry bored kids when the food arrived it looked like crap on the plate there was nothing about it that was appealing and everything was cold especially the eggs they were like rubber. Any time we needed a refill or extra napkins we had to track down our waitress and when she brought the bill it was $71 dollars. I looked at the bill and could not figure out how 3  kids breakfast meals and 3 adult 1 breakfast, 1 dried up hockey puck Swiss steak and one fish dinner added up too 71 dollars. After I got home I studied it closer and decided to call and are if the manager could explain. He was SO RUDE he told me we ordered the wrong stuff it was not on the kids menu and I said ok well I must have misread the menu but the waitress could have told me or mentioned I ordered it differently so they were charging me for adult meals. He again said it was my fault and hung up on me. Yep I am calling corporate a dinner out with family turned into a ridiculously expensive mess!",

Breakfast is served all day. I came with my parents after our other plans were a bust. The are very friendly to the handicapped and elderly here. The food came quickly. I informed the waitress it was my mother's birthday and they brought a vanilla ice cream sundae complete with chocolate sauce, whipped cream and a cherry. Very nice.

When you enter the restaurant, there is a sign that says they don't discriminate based on race or origin or a few other things.  Nothing about orientation, so it's obvious that they have not changed their hateful stance.   For me, the best part of this restaurant is the attached store.  Today, there was a load of fun Halloween stuff.  I almost broke down and bought a Halloween pillow that lit up with LED lights, but I overcame the temptation!  For lunch, I had chicken tenderloins, fried apples, fried okra, and steamed broccoli.  It was hard coming up with vegetables that were not fried or weren't cooked in meat.  Just not my favorite place, but If Deanna wanted me to go to the Congo for lunch, I'd say OF COURSE.",

Sad thing about Cracker Barrel in general is all restaurants have recently added military discounts Cracker Barrel does not. Sure they have a police discount or law enforcement .   Update came in at 820 pm was told there was a 10 minute wait .   Ordered a chef salad and wife and granddaughter ordered their food. But at 8:30 go my salad corrected twice and it's 9pm and my wife didn't get her food until we complained to the manager at 9pm.   Inexcusable.   Have not been here in a year at least for dinner most likely will not return.",

Service here was lax to say the least, got coffee refilled once only after asking. My wifes plate looked as if the cook was ready to go home and did not care enough to even make it look edible. Portions are a joke, this looks like a kids plate. Sorry to see another mainstay of my childhood go away. This will be our last visit.",

I ordered 4 veg plate: three greens and pintos, onion and chow-chow. Food runner/waiter brought to our table, and fingers were touching the overflowing small cup of chow chow, and the onion for pintos was a thick cut slab. Our actual waitress got me a new container of chow chow, and by then - I had tasted the greens. They were horrible - NOT the Cracker Barrel greens that I've known since they came to Charlotte. No flavor, hardly any meat, and bland - not to mention how they looked,  pintos were barely lukewarm. Manager came a apologized profusely, and said he checked the greens and they weren't prepared according to recipe. When asked about the onion slab, he said CB doesn't serve chopped onion - and gave some silly reason. I suspect it's too big of a hassle for them.  Manager was very nice, as was our waitress. But at that point, I was done.  For what it's worth, the usweetened tea was good, and hubby said his chicken pot pie was good.  Funny thing- one lady seated beside us sent her silverware back for another set also. Don't have to worry about me ever going in there again.",

Ever since this location opened I have made a few stops, but one thing I will say...like every other Cracker Barrel, expect a wait.  The best thing about Cracker Barrel is the menu. An extensive menu that can satisfy two people eating or a large group. I typically go for breakfast and dinner. The complimentary biscuits and corn bread are always a great way to start the meal. From eggs to chicken and a large variety of sides, the food is always pretty good.  The staff at this location is always on point and I have always enjoyed my meal! And, I love browsing the gift shop while I wait.",
