I had shrrimp scampi which i could tell the shrimp was fresh.. something was missing!! I think it was the garlic... had the crawfish etoufee and the roux was bitter!! Im like wth?? With that being said i decided not to have the dessert.. oh and another thing the representation of new orleans or cajun was not present in the staff that works here.. people that are creole are naturally warm and welcoming!!  grade C",

    "text": "This is (I mean WAS) my first time at this establishment. I purchased a Groupon that was expiring so decided to utilize it. I made reservations for myself, mom & son. Once we were seated, the server proceeded to tell us about the restaurant week menu. I advised that I had a Groupon and was not interested in the special. Well low & behold, I could not use my Groupon. I told the server the Groupon was expiring, thus the reason why we were there. Not my issue that it was during restaurant week. He asked me if I wanted him to speak to the manager about it & I stated \"yes\". He returns & informs me that the manager stated that I could use my Groupon. Great news or at least until the check arrived. Once I received the check, the amount of the Groupon ($45) is not deducted rather only $25. I inquire about this to now be told that only the amount I paid could be deducted or the manager would allow the Groupon to be extended a month...all of this after we have eaten. We drove an hour to this place trying to use the Groupon before it expired. If I was only going to receive the paid amount of the Groupon, there was not any need for us to drive this hour on a Friday afternoon in rush hour traffic. I am not sure what restaurant week is but we did not partake of the special menu being offered. In addition I would not visit a restaurant that is a permanent Groupon fixture during \"restaurant week\". I believe the point of restaurant week is to try out restaurants you may not normally visit due to cost but Cajun Queen is a Groupon regular that can be visited for an expensive amount anytime of the year. I patronize businesses that actually warrant my business. Unfortunately this will not be one of them.",

The place wasn't too crowded but our table was right in front of the band upstairs and I was a little worried it was going to be crazy loud. Luckily it ended up being the best spot we could've gotten.  The table started with fried oysters and fried crawfish which you aren't going to go wrong with.  I ordered the ribeye and broccoli with a cup of gumbo. I wasn't crazy about the gumbo, and I thought it was a little thin and lacked any substance. Everyone else seemed to like it though. My ribeye was cooked and seasoned very well though with all that fried food in the beginning I couldn't finish it all. Two guys ordered some bread pudding for dessert and I tried some and it was awesome.  As for the music, they would play a few songs and then take a break so we could have conversations if we wanted. We had some Portuguese guys with us and someone asked them to play some Portuguese songs which apparently they did. You could tell the guy on the keyboards knew what he was doing and seemed to enter another world when he started playing. Overall it was a fun night with good food and everyone there seemed to enjoy themselves.",

The fried green tomatoes are prob the best I have ever had.  The 7th street stumbler is an awesome cocktail!! Not to sweet, but still slightly fruity. I could have easily drank a few of these but I stuck to one. Ordered the Catfish, if you like spicy you would enjoy this...it's awesome.  The reason I give this place a 4 and not a 5 is because of the service we experienced last time we were there. Our waiter was AWFUL, extremely rude -- prob the worst service I have got in a restaurant in years.  He rarely came by to ask if we needed anything, didnt clear our appetizer plates and we were sitting at a small two top. When we were finished, we waiting around for 25 minutes for him to show up. When he did finally show up he threw our check back at us without saying a word. The ONLY reason I left a tip was bc I use to be a server and even tho he was horrendous, I still can't bring myself to leave a person no tip.  Anyways, the bad service I experienced the one time I went here will not keep me from going here.  Love Cajun Queen!",

The shrimp etouffee and shrimp diane that we got were both quite good, and the service was pretty decent as well.  They forgot a few things, but were nice people at least.   The location is pretty nice and we were able to take a walk around the block afterwards to help digest (why the hell is 7th street totally paved over into some 5 lane highway... slow down people).  Having just gone to New Orleans a few months ago, I'm glad that Charlotte has a place to get  this type of food, although it's still not perfectly on point.  Live Jazz never hurts (but if you sit downstairs you won't be able to see it and probably can't hear it too well either).",

Whether you like \"Diane\" style(mildly seasoned)or Etouffe style (spicy) my personal favorite I usually get the Etouffe chicken and shrimp combo. Craw fish also available.  Had the Blackened fish before, it was delish also. Before that the Blackened Pork Medallions with plantains, off the charts ! Fried green tomatoes are a hit for appetizers, juicy and tart. Good wine selection, and beer also.  Service is very attentive as you would expect. Let the valet park your car, as mainly curbside parking around corner, eclectic old part of town near uptown, small parking lot.  Long story short, you must eat here many times to experience the various dishes available. Weather a simple night out, or entertaining clients, a must on the dining list....",

Very good food, not quite Southern as in Louisiana but very close. Very friendly staff and quick service.

I prefer a good dive (there was one down the street from this place - Bayou Kitchen - it deserves honorable mention - it was a better example of real cajun food). The food is good - the location - also nice. I took one star away because it's not as good as the place that was just down the street.",

We booked a late night dinner due to his schedule  and when we arrived, the jazz band was already on break.  We were seated but our waitress appeared to not to want to be there.  I ordered the New Orleans ice tea and my fiance ordered sweet tea, it took a while before the drinks were delivered and let me tell you - It wasn't nothing to brag about.  The food was spicy not flavorful, just spicy.  Even the couple beside us was a little perplexed about it just being spicy (a little eavesdropping).  Needless, to say not a great experience.  So fortunate that I was able to get a group-on discount and not pay for a $70 experience that I didn't enjoy.  I wouldn't return or recommend this place.",

Cute part of the city (Elizabeth) with other historic homes around it, Cajun Queen has been around since 1985 in this hundred year old house   They have nightly jazz which on cool fall evenings fills the breeze flowing through the southern charm of the house   There are tables on the first floor and a full bar upstairs. They also have complimentary valet.  I tried the 'Cajun popcorn' as an appetizer (they also give you bread rolls and butter). This is fried battered crawfish. A bit rich, couldn't finish all of it. The etouffe  was also reliably authentic and somewhat on the rich side (I chose the etouffe with all three {shrimp, crawfish, shrimp}) although I think the chicken is best left out altogether.  This place is one of the charlotte landmarks I'd say. Five stars for ambience, three for food, four for service. Four overall.",

If you choose to self park, read the signs posted so you don't get booted. Tip the valet, they hustle hard.  Me and the boyfriend had a reservation for 7 on a Friday and were running late but we were still seated pretty quickly. I will also note that we had a groupon worth $40 worth of food.   We ordered the New Orleans BBQ shrimp for the appetizer. I know that garlic is an ingredient but I almost died. The shrimp was well cooked but it seemed like they soaked the shrimp in garlic, sauteed it in garlic, used garlic powder- the whole nine. Thank goodness that they provide complimentary bread to negate some of the garlic.  For the entrees I ordered the Etouffle all 3 (chicken, shrimp, crawfish) and the boyfriend ordered the Creole all 3. Most disappointing entrees ever because there was no seasonings. The Etouffle had heat but no flavor. At a Cajun restaurant, I should be tasting at the minimum some Old Bay seasoning and some Lawry's. The boyfriends creole was the same- bland. Needless to say we used the hell out of the salt/pepper shaker on the table. It's actually pretty sad because the meats were properly cooked but so damn bland.   I've been to the NOLA before and loved it. I've eaten Cajun food before and loved it. I've made Cajun style foods myself at home before and loved it. Thank goodness for Groupons because I would've had to hop in the kitchen myself to show them how it's done if we paid in full.   Service was odd. Our server was perfect at first but then it just went downhill. I was almost done eating when I got a refill of water. We didn't get checked on until we were also almost done eating. We ordered beers in cool glasses. The boyfriend wanted a second beer and the server throws a bottled beer on the table and quickly walks away...Um okay.   I'm glad I ate here because of all the rave reviews because I wanted to try it myself but I will NEVER return. This place is borderline insulting.",

They have a live band on sunday morning for brunch which wad a nice little addition to the ambiance. It is a small restaurants that looks like it was a house. This adds to the down home feel and warmth of cajun food.  My friends and I had the Crawfish Scampi with grits, BBQ Shrimp, the gumbo and the blackened chicken. It was all very good, but the gumbo didn't have as much flavor as the other dishes.  I DEFINITELY plan to go back again!",

    "text": "When I found out we were going here for brunch while I was in town, I was excited.  I had not had beignets since I was in Nola in April and I was craving them.  When we arrived at 10 to 11 (brunch begins at 11), there was already a line of people waiting outside.  The doors opened and people walked in like they had not ate in years, we knew we were in for a treat.  The restaurant is within what appears to be a house.  The dining rooms are where a living room and a den would typically be.  We were seated by the fireplace, which was running since it was 45 degrees outside.  The decor is very quaint and welcoming, almost like you're visiting a relative's house.  The dinner menu is also available all day but you truly go to this place for brunch.  I originally asked for a coffee with amaretto but they don't serve alcohol before noon (I'm spoiled from NY brunches) but their regular coffee was just as good.  We started off with an order of beignets.  6 perfectly sized fried balls of dough were presented with the most delicious strawberry compote in the middle for dipping.  The beignets were perfect and light and that compote made my day.    For our entrees, we each got something different and decided to pick and choose from the other plates.  I got the bacon, egg, and cheese omelet.  This omelet was thick with a whole layer of bacon going through the center.  It also came with a side of cheesy grits, which were also delicious, and fresh fruit.  My friend got the bananas foster French toast.  The bananas were sweet but good and the toast itself was fluffy and delicious.  My other friend got the rice and beans, which yes becomes an entire meal since sausage is also included.  These were some of the best rice and beans the three of us have ever tasted.  And this is coming from a Puerto Rican, who also confirmed their tastiness.  Overall, this is a fantastic place for brunch.  Get there early, and try a little bit of everything.",

The food would have been ten times better if they just used a little bit of fresh seafood. I tried my friends etoufee with chicken and I wish I had ordered that.

I wasn't crazy about their bread, it was really hard. My friend had the gumbo soup and I tried it and it was delicious. They were pretty busy on a weekday. We saw the waiter maybe 3 times-When he greeted us, when he took our order and dropped off the check. He never came by in between to check on us or fill up our drinks.Service wasn't that great but I will definitely give it another try. Other than that, food was good!",

My friend got etouffe, and it was the perfect consistency. I got cajun pasta and enjoyed every single bite. Don't forget to order a hurricane--in True New Orleans style, it was delicious.   The restaurant itself is such a cozy environment. It's in an old house. If you're not bothered by walking around nooks and corners to get to your seat, it makes for a really comforting dining experience. It felt a little bit crowded (you sit closely to your \"neighbors\") but that doesn't bother me. Also, keep in mind that it is valet parking only. There's really nowhere else to park. Also, make a reservation if you can--it gets extremely crowded.    Recommend this restaurant if you're looking for something unique.",

    "text": "Ok, I love this place.  Is that what you want to hear?  I really, honestly, truly love this restaurant.  \"What makes this place so special?\" you ask.  For me this place is the perfect marriage of great service and great food, and aren't those the very reasons we go to all these restaurants in the first place?  Service. & Food.    The food was nothing short of pure, delectable bliss.  We (my dad and I) started with a few drinks and the New Orleans B.B.Q. Shrimp, \"Sauteed with Butter, Garlic, Beer and a Variety of Cajun/Creole Spices\".  It contained, 5 juicy, succulent pieces of shrimp; swimming in a small bowl of \"cajun/creole spices\"  for $8.95.  Very spicy + very tender = very good.  Don't forget to dip your bread in the broth!    For the main course, my dad and I split the Shrimp Diane.  Now the Diane sauce contains, \"Mushrooms, Garlic, Butter, Green Onions, Parsley and Queen's Magic Spices sauteed together. Moderately spiced and served over Rice.\"  They give you the option of splitting it for only $5.00 more bringing the entree price to 23.95.  Certainly not cheap by any means, but well worth the cost.  The best way to describe the taste, is to image garlic, butter, onions, and a bunch of \"Queens Magic Spices\" working harmoniously to perfectly marinate the shrimp with the rice keeping things from getting to sloppy.  Its Cajun food at its finest.    At that point, things were so good we just HAD to get dessert, right??  We decided to order the pecan pie.  I mean, pick an adjective - amazing, spectacular, splendid, etc.  It was served to us warm and moist (that's what HE said - LOL), as if it was just taken out of the oven, with dab of whipped cream.  The service was on point from start to finish; from the valet to the host/hostess to the super friendly bartender upstairs.  Everyone was really kind and polite. What exactly separates the staff here from other restaurants?  Its all in the details...for example, every single person said, \"be with you in one minute\" or \"be right with you\".  No one ever ignored us, or expected us to wait until we could be helped.  My drinks (adult/H2O) were never empty. We didn't have to think/worry about parking.  There was a plethora of condiments, hot sauces, etc to satisfy even the most particular taste buds.  Bathrooms were immaculate.  They had live jazz.  ...See what I mean about the details?  I'm hooked.  I'll be back very, very soon, maybe even tomorrow!  I love this place.  There.  I said it!",

Trust me, don't waste your money, there are better places in Charlotte.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying, I REALLY wanted to like this place. I have heard countless rave reviews. Of course, I wasn't expecting it to compare to my food experiences in Louisiana but I was expecting something. My mother and I ventured here on Saturday for dinner and we were both really disappointed.   Fried green tomatoes- 2/5 The breading was really bland and they were topped with a gallon of sauce. They were very unappetizing. I prefer the ones I make at home.  Fried oysters app- really good and the only thing I enjoyed. I would highly recommend.   Salads- Truly out of the bag salad mix. They could have added some tomato or something to liven it up. The blue cheese dressing was good though.  Crawfish etoufee- It was very average with way too much rice.  Service, however, was phenomenal. We simply didn't enjoy most of our food. I really wouldn't even go back to try it again.",

    "text": "I haven't really had \"cajun\" food before, so when I saw an online deal for it I definitely wanted to check it out. We rarely venture outside Lake Norman and into Charlotte, but the thought of some spicy grub was enough to entice me. Man, I'm glad we went!  When we first arrived at 6pm the place was hopping. I highly recommend making reservations. As for parking, they have a complimentary valet service right next to the restaurant, so I recommend using them rather than driving around looking for street parking. The restaurant itself is a converted home, and has a great, quaint feel to it. However, the small rooms lead to tight quarters, and the neighboring tables will be in pretty close proximity to you. We ate upstairs, and if the close tables didn't make the room loud enough, the live band playing behind us aided in turning tableside conversation into a shouting match. Now this would really get on my nerves at other restaurants, but here it worked. I didn't mind the music, and had no problem forgoing conversation for a bit while enjoying the ambiance of the little room and smooth music. Also, they only played about four songs or so, and took a five minute break in between each, so it wasn't a constant barrage of noise.  Our server was quick and efficient, and our food was brought out in a timely manner despite the bustling customer count. For once I did have a cocktail rather than beer or wine, mainly because the mixed drinks were about the same price as a glass of wine. I ordered the Lynchwood Lemonade ($8) which consisted of Jack Daniels, Triple Sec and lemonade. It was a nice, strong drink and went great with the meal and music. The missus ordered a melon martini that she enjoyed quite a bit. It wasn't too sweet and still had a good kick to it.  After placing our orders some complimentary bread was brought over, which consisted of three rolls. These things might have well been hockey pucks based on how flavorless and hard they were. I think they might have fallen off the \"bread pudding\" rack and into the \"fresh daily rolls\" basket because there was no way these things should have been served as they were.  For dinner I ordered the steak special of the day ($24). It came with salad or gumbo, and I went with the salad. Big mistake, because all I got was a bowl with chunks of romaine, a slice of cucumber and some shredded carrot. The vinaigrette that came with it was extremely potent and way too strong. After picking at this salad the main course showed up, which was a 10oz sirloin, crawfish etouffee, mashed potatoes and broccoli. The steak was cooked to order, and despite it being a large (as in tall) cut of meat it was still tender. The blackened seasoning rub added a good deal of spice and flavor to the beef, and I was quite a fan. I was equally happy with the crawfish etouffee, especially since I've never had crawfish before. The etouffee consisted of peeled, small crawfish pieces (smaller than popcorn shrimp) tossed with veggies in a dark, spicy sauce. I really liked the crawfish, which tasted more like lobster than shrimp, and the spice level was perfect...not too much where I couldn't eat it but enough that I felt it after each bite. The mashed potatoes were decent, but nothing out of this world. The broccoli was done kind of poorly, as it was just some huge hunks of slightly steamed broccoli. While the sides and salad were nothing spectacular, the entree was one heck of a spicy, tastetacular bite.  The missus' went with the  Crawfish Diane ($18.95) and enjoyed it as well. The Diane was done in a lighter sauce that was not as spicy as the etouffee, so if you want something that's a little milder this would be the dish. This was her first bite of crawfish too and really enjoyed it. The Diane had a little more substance in that it added rice to the protein and veggie mixture, and there was so much that she had leftovers for lunch the following day. While it was tasty, I thought it was just a bit bland compared to the etouffee.  We ended up splurging for dessert when we saw they offered bread pudding, which has become something we can't pass up when dining out. Cajun Queen makes one heck of a Bourbon Bread Pudding (5), and if you are a fan of bread pudding you shouldn't pass this up. The dessert came in a decent-sized ramekin and was filled with this warm treat. The bread pudding had chunks of peach and raisen going through it, and they became hot and gooey from the heat of the bread pudding. It had great taste and texture, with a nice crust on top. There was also a pile of whipped cream and caramel drizzled across the crust, making the dessert a visual and edible offering.   Cajun Queen dishes out some great grub. While some things can be improved upon (sides and rolls), the stuff that counts is pretty banging. Our entrees were delicious and the cocktails were done well. This is one of those places that we will definitely be bringing friends and family to when they visit from out of town.",

I've been here twice, and unfortunately, I don't think I'll be back.  Fun atmosphere, great service, and yes, it would be a good date night.  But not a good group night.",

The \"steamed\" broccoli on my plate was more dipped in hot water and still raw but it still tasted great. We also both got desserts, the key lime pie (my all time favorite dessert) and that was incredible and the bourbon pecan pie, which my fiance said was also amazing and was served warm. The reason for 3 stars is the service. Our waiter, Brandon, acted like he couldn't care less that we were there, just kinda threw the food down and walked away, checked on us only once and honestly just didn't even try to offer good service. The bus boy who refilled water, brought bread and took our plates came around more often than he did. However, when a group of older people came in he was so attentive and pointed out everything on the menu to them, went over where the seafood was from and took all the time in the world as he probably assumed they had more money than we did. Needless to say he got the tip that he earned for the service he gave us. I would absolutely go back for the food, just hope I would get a different server.",

The atmosphere keeps bringing me back I love sitting in this cozy house listening to the band and sipping on my dirty martini and the Mardi Gras beads just put me in a good mood.  I have had great experiences with the food and a couple just ok experiences - but I think now I know exactly what to order you can not go wrong with the appetizers the oysters are some of the best I've had and I love the crawfish scampi.  The BBQ shrimp are beyond tasty but I normally order that as my meal now it comes as an entree too. A couple of things on the menu I don't care for are the shrimp and grits if your thinking you'll be getting some southern shrimp and grits I will steer you away from this entree you will be disappointed. The gumbo was also a big disappointment to me where is the heat.  The fish specials are usually pretty good but can be bland. Stick to the dishes they are known for, etouffee, diane, creole, you'll be happy,",

Huge, perfect amount of breading, juicy and so tasty!! The barbecue shrimp were just about as good, sopped up every drop of broth with the complimentary bread(warm rolls) provided..And for dessert if you may,  Beignets  !! They looked great, and tasted just as great , still hot from the fryer with a perfect dusting of powered sugar and a strawberry compote(jam?) dipping sauce..Delicious!!  On the way out, we both used the restrooms(madame and monsieur) and both very clean ..And a big bonus, dined with a groupon..I definitely recommend the Cajun Queen and will be back, hopefully for dinner to catch the live jazz band playing there nightly..",

I will say this place has a beautiful ambiance. It looks like a house which is converted to a beautiful restaurant. There is valet parking available. The receptionist at the front gave us a nice seat on the second floor. It was just our luck because there was live jazz music being played that night. During the restaurant week, this place does have a very good choice of Entrees. You will be served with a 3 course meal with the addition of a glass wine of your choice. We had the cup of seafood gumbo to begin with. The soup served was the right quantity. Not too much or too less. Soup was warm enough. The contained scallops, shrimp, vegetables. For the entree, we had Diane with Chicken and Fresh Fish (blackened Tilapia). Both the chicken as well as fish we cooked well. The topping on the fresh fish were great. The diane chicken had a variety of vegetables on it along with rice. You can also have shrimp and chicken together in it. The food was warm. The third and final course is a dessert of your choice. We chose to have the Key Lime Pie. I cant remember much but I don't think a Key Lime Pie can go wrong at all. The server was definitely very polite and nice to us. She was checking on us at regular intervals and the food was served in a timely manner. During restaurant week, I would say the price of the meal is $$. However if you decided to go some other time, then it would be $$$. The restrooms were clean and tidy.",

Their is chicken...two good sized pieces, shrimp, crawfish, and andouille sausage. For me, that is enough for at least two meals. The shrimp appetizer is really good too!

We were greeted by our hostess and two servers who were smiling, friendly, and ready to go.  We ordered the beignets with homemade strawberry jam for starters, warm, light, sprinkled with powdered sugar, yummy!  We had the tasso biscuits and gravy, an omelet, the crab cake eggs benedict, and chicken strips with French fries from the kids menu.  Everything was great including the service and unsweetened iced tea.  The serving size was large, but not excessive.  When we were finished, we were too full to try the Key Lime pie which we were told was to die for.  If I had any complaint, it would be that the tables are a little too small for the generously sized plates, but this is a small place, so the small tables are a necessary requirement. The jazz music is a little loud, but not obnoxious, and is appropriate for the New Orleans Cajun and creole menu.  All in all, a very pleasant experience. We will be going back for dinner to try the regular entrees.",

Disappointed at the abrupt hostess service but ignored this because of my anticipation of a great meal, NOT, I ordered the salmon, gumbo combo and had the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer, they were ok. The gumbo had good ingredients but not much flavor ( I've lived in New Orleans so I know what good gumbo tastes like). The salmon seemed over cooked and dry. So as far as the meal was concerned, disappointed. My waiter was great and is the reason for the 3 stars. Also my seat was tight and was positioned over an air conditioning vent that kept me very cool. I may or may not give it",

    "text": "A four star review is very good IMO.  My wife and I flew into Charlotte, NC on our way to Columbia, SC for my son's military graduation.  After \"yelping\" several restaurants in the area we decided on the Cajun Queen.  Excellent choice, we especially enjoyed the ambiance and atmosphere of the Cajun Queen, it's a house converted into the restaurant.  The upstairs had a \"trio\" of musicians that were very enjoyable to listen to.  Now onto the food:  We started with the fried oysters, they were cooked to a very tender deliciousness with a very nice remoulade dipping sauce.  I had the shrimp and grits, my wife had a shrimp and rice etouffee dish.  All of which where very nice, although my shrimp was a pinch too spicy, but enjoyable nonetheless.   The service was excellent, well worth the stop.  I notice that there are a lot of 5 star reviews, and I certainly could agree with that, but, I'm giving it a solid 4 star.",

I first ordered the New Orleans BBQ shrimp, the only good tasting part of this was the shrimp and the rice and sauce to this was very bland. I decided to get something else and I got the fried shrimp which is served with broccoli & mash potatoes = $24 - this is ridiculous pricing and I wondered why it was so slow in there because they have bland tasting food and high prices. The server was very nice and patient about it. Whenever me and my family were walking up to the restaurant also the first window we walked past we saw all the employees just sitting down which is understandable is some ways. My mom also got shrimp with grits and she was disappointed and it was bland as well",

He was amazing, unfortunately I don't remember his name but he was very personable and knowledgeable of the menu. The gentleman that came over to fill our glasses, never let us get past a half of cup. Our sever constantly peeked his head to make sure we were okay.   I did think the gumbo would be brown stewed instead of tomato based but it was still good. I ordered the Shrimp and grits and it was pretty good. Not the best but it was a good portion, and the blackened shrimp definitely helped.   I'm not usually one to leave reviews, but the service at this restaurant was SUPERB.",

We sat in the main dining room on the right as you enter the restaurant - right by the entrance.  The tables are extremely small, and with four people, there was not enough room for drinks, water, bread, etc.  I asked to have some of the items removed, as we were not sure where they would put the food.  The food and service were very good, actually excellent.  We all decided to order something different, and because the size of the table, they would bring each dish out separately, with clean bowl and silverware - we'd all share the one dish, and then they would bring out the next.  The waiter actually put thought to the order on how to present the dishes, due to heat/spice of each dish - very well thought out.  Our server was very tentative, and again good service.  Definitely will be back, as the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp was my favorite, and then followed by the Crawfish Etoufee. Definitely need to have a reservation.",

We often find the gumbo kinda bland but it's nothing that we can't spruce up with hot sauce, salt and pepper. Service is consistently good, as well.   The only negative about this spot is how they seat people. There have been a few times when we've come when it hasn't been busy but they always seem to put us at tiny two people tables, crammed next to other couples. I get it - they want larger tables for larger parties but if it isn't crowded, why cram the customers who are there into small tables?!?  Note #1: we never come without the Groupon. It's a great deal. They have signs everywhere that say you must wait 24 hrs after purchasing the Groupon to use it so get it at least a day before you plan on coming.  Note #2: on an awkward date or don't really like the person you are with? Ask to eat upstairs - the band (which is awesome) is so loud that it's impossible to carry on a conversation. Me? I love talking to my fiance (corny but True) so I prefer to sit downstairs. The music is so loud that we can still hear it but we can also hear each other.",

We started with an order of beignets as well as a fried green tomatoes app.  The beignets were exactly what you want in a deep fried confection: pillowy, soft but not doughy, with a tender outer crumb and a sprinkling of powdered sugar.  The compote that it comes with is also very tasty.  The fried green tomatoes were very good, as well.  They come on a bed of mixed greens with a remoulade over the top.  The remoulade was delicious and the tomatoes themselves were fried well.  My only wish was for a bit more salt in the batter; otherwise a bite of tomato without any remoulade was a bit lacking.  For our entrees I got the spicy tasso biscuits and gravy.  Holy goodness, was this dish rich.  The gravy was probably 50% fat (that's a good thing).  The tasso wasn't really spicy but it was tasty.  It came with a couple eggs scrambled over the top that were a nice textural contrast.  The biscuits themselves were world-class.  Extremely tender, perfectly baked, and an excellent accompaniment for the other components of the dish.  I was practically licking my plate after I'd eaten all the food.  My wife got fried green tomatoes eggs benedict.  I didn't try hers but the eggs were perfectly poached and I know from the app we had that the tomatoes were good.  She also had a little fruit salad on the side from which I nabbed a couple grapes.  Service was prompt, plates were cleared in a timely manner, and our table was in a porch area to the side that allowed us to get a glimpse of the beautiful weather outdoors.  We were stuffed to the gills so Independence Park being right across the street allowed us to take a lovely stroll immediately after.  Definitely worth a repeat visit, maybe for dinner next time.",

First, I showed up about 20 minutes late for my reservation (I know, I'm that guy) and they were able to seat us right away on a Friday night.  No questions, no hassle, they simply sent us to an open table as if we had showed up right on time for our reservation.  We had our 3 year old son with us so we each breathed a sigh of relief once seated.  Initially I wasn't sure what to order, until I started leafing through pictures on Yelp.  While it all looked good, the Shrimp and Grits stopped me in my tracks.  It wasn't your everyday Shrimp and Grits as they've given it a nice Cajun twist by adding a tasty creole sauce.  The shrimp had a distinct smokey flavor that worked really well with the dish.  The Andouille sausage also packed a nice punch that really pulled the whole meal together.    For dessert we ordered the Tollhouse Cookie Pie.  I had never had anything quite like it before.  It was really good; however, we both felt as though it could have had more chocolate chips.  The walnuts added a nice dimension too.",

For starters, the drinks are strong, the fried pickles are awesome and the service was stellar. The staff is extremely friendly and peppy and service fast. I ordered the Diane with chicken, shrimp and crawfish and it was incredible, authentic and out of this world!  I wholeheartedly recommend Cajun Queen to anyone visiting Charlotte or any locals who are living under a rock. :)",

    "text": "This was my first time visiting this restaurant on 3/22/17. Cute little place.  I had the Fried New Orleans platter with the gumbo to start.  The gumbo smelled absolutely awesome! It had a little spicy kick but some how there was no flavor.  Very odd.  I received my entrees and it was beautifully presented. The smells were amazing. The fish looked like it was fried to perfection. The taste of everything was extremely disappointing.  No flavor what so ever.  The red beans from the red beans and rice were canned kidney beans with no not a sprinkle of seasoning. The catfish was beautiful. It looked like it was going to be crispy. It was not. One good thing is that you receive a good amount of food. But for the price, its definitely not worth it because the food isnt great at all. I will probably not return",

It met all of my expectations and more.   I like that their menu for Restaurant Week includes all of their classic dishes and a glass of wine!   I decided to go with the seafood gumbo, etouffee with all three (chicken, shrimp and crawfish) and the key lime our for dessert.   The seafood gumbo was classic. It was warm and hearty with just the right amount of spices. The etouffee was nothing short of amazing!!! I'm basically a fan of this dish for two reasons....one they are not skimpy with any of the meat selections and two it's sooo spicy! I definitely recommend sopping....(yes sopping) up some of that delicious sauce with those rolls. Yum.   Not to be outdone the key lime pie was a great way to end the meal.   Add to an amazing meal a live band and complimentary valet....this place is definitely worth a visit!",

I recommended Cajun Queen for my friend & her partner to visit during their time in Charlotte. While sitting on the outside patio this past Saturday (May 5), the manager on duty was attentive & courteous to another couple; asking about the quality of their meal, if they had any additional needs, etc. but totally disregarded my friend & her partner. Both couples were sitting in close proximity so this was not an oversight by the manager, he intentionally chose to completely ignore & disregard other patrons. Disappointing. I will no longer recommend Cajun Queen.",

Our waiter is seeing the incapable or unwilling to answer any questions that we had about the menu. Don't substitute anything because you won't get what you ask for. We were a wedding party that came for brunch and I ordered the salmon and I was given blackened shrimp instead. When I asked about it he said why I could take it back but it would take longer and the rest of your party will have eaten by then. So I was pissed about that. One other person ask for no broccoli they got a plate full of broccoli. Couple other people's orders were messed up and then they added a house gratuity to everyone's bill. There were only 6 people there. There was no offer to comp my order or for me to talk to a manager or to even at fix my meal that I ordered. I would not waste my money going back here again it was truly a horrible experience and the only reason that I gave them two stars was because the bride actually like the key lime pie. Other than that this place is garbage.",

When my niece and I came it was after the snow storm so it was a little bit slick outside and it was really cold. I love the fact that they have valet. When we walked in we were greeted and asked where we would like to sit either downstairs or upstairs with the band. I really wanted to sit by the band but once we got upstairs we realized how congested it was and quickly changed our mind and opted to sit downstairs. The ambiance was very nice and I liked the salt and pepper grinder. The fire place was lit and I could still hear the band playing upstairs but there was a draft coming in from the window. For appetizer I ordered the fried green tomatoes. They were okay just a little bit too firm for me. I ordered the all three Dianne with a side salad. I will say that the food was good but very under seasoned. I had to really season my food once I got home. My niece ordered the chicken, mashed potatoes and broccoli. She didn't say anything about the seasoning but I guess to each its own. I am still a fan and I would definitely come back and try some other things I would just ask them for extra seasoning on my food. Something that I definitely don't think that I should have to request at a place with Cajun in the name.",

    "text": "\"A very flavorful New Orleans' experience without burning your tongue\" The restaurant is an old house in a very nice area of town an area called Elizabeth. Open every night for dinner, and they have a Live Jazz band every night. Tried the Abita Beers (Amber, and Fruity) both good. In the second floor of the house is the bar, and in a room next to it is the Jazz Band. Nice art in the walls that is for sale without price meaning - if you have to ask you can not afford it. For appetizers we tried the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp (4.5) - the right amount of spiciness, with layers of flavor. You will want to use the bread to soak all that wonderful juiciness. We also ordered the Craw-fish Scampi (3), it was lemony and not as complex as the shrimp. The Blackened new York steak was nice but uneventful (3)  the Mahi-Mahi with Diane sauce on top of mashed potatoes (4)was very good. I tried the special of the day - Pan Seared Duck Breast ( medium) on top of garlic fried potatoes w Craw-fish Etouffe (4.5) really nice combination. It had the best flavors of Cajun/Creole cuisine but it was not spicy or heavy. The only weak note was the Seafood Gumbo (2.5) it was just OK a bit bland, I added some drops of the hot sauce and it was better.  In conclusion, it was a very nice experience and definitely a high end New Orleans experience.  They do not offer espresso =(. But the Bourbon Bread Pudding hit a perfect mark, it was unexpected light and fluffy, not too sweet. We also had a very good Pecan Pie (3.5).",

Our server was personable, knowledgeable of the menu&gave good recommendations. He also did not hover. Cool and he got an A from us. We really enjoyed our drinks (get Planters Punch), salads, Shrimp etoufee' and Chicken Diane. We were unimpressed with BBQ shrimp's flavor. The broth was wonderful for dipping the ( cold) bread, yet the shrimp had no flavor. Maybe they can marinate the shrimp with the broth instead of just dropping them in?Also, the bread pudding was just okay. We figured the bourbon&peaches would pack a punch. The seating is tight like others point out, but manageable. Prices match well with portion sizes aka we did not feel cheated. We will definitely  come back for food&drinks only. We will then pickup some Mama R's bread pudding for dessert.",

My only complaint was, we felt incredibly rushed. We planned on having a nice, relaxing dinner. From the time we walked in the door to the moment our food came out, it was 14 minutes. A little too quick for me. I felt like our waiter kept trying to rush us out the door. We were finished with dinner (drinks, entree and dessert) in less than an hour.

It wasn't bad, but the only option to give the meal a kick of spice was texas pete or their own special jalapeno sauce. The service didn't exist, as that I ate at the bar.   The parking is badly setup. The parking lot is small, and forces people to park at other businesses or on the side of the street.",

It's an amazing venue for food--really cool, old house--you feel like you're eating at an actual home--a nice one--on the Bayou or something. Or at least that's how it felt to a transplanted Yankee like myself.   Great southern style cocktails here, so make sure you try at least one before dinner. I'm talking Souther Comfort mixed with all sorts of stuff--just amazing. And they're strong, so go easy.   I had the catfish dish, and it was incredible. Hard to describe, but it was blackened with an amazing tangy sauce and came with mashed potatoes and greens. Their menu is really different, so make sure to check out all that's available. I'll definitely be back do so.",

It is hot and more of a broth base that is perfect to dip with the hot rolls.   Oysters are also lightly fried and not greasy, so enjoy without worrying about your waist.",

    "text": "I LOVE this restaurant. So far, I have only been twice, but boy I wish I could afford to go weekly! My boyfriend and I just went for Valentine's Day. Had a reservation, got there a little early, and were still seated immediately, and in the jazz room too! (Side note: the female singer they had on Valentine's was INCREDIBLE. Wish I got her name) My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE the rolls they give everyone, possibly the best rolls I've had at any restaurant. For my drink, I ordered the chocolate martini, my favorite! Oh, and of course a Hurricane later, also delicious  For my entree I had the special Tilapia with the crawfish topping. OH! First, let me mention, the gumbo that comes before the entree is AMAZING. I don't care if it's not authentic! Who cares about authenticity when the food is THAT good. I ate that gumbo so fast my boyfriend was making comments like, \"Slow down, it's not going anywhere!\" It had a little bit of a kick to it, which I don't normally like, but the flavor was just too good! Now, back to the entree. Last time, I ordered the same thing, but I didn't even try the crawfish topping; I just gave it all to my mom. This time, however, I realized what a mistake that was! I've actually never had crawfish before, so I have nothing to compare theirs to, but it was delicious, and I'm already craving more! The tilapia, like the first time, was also to-die-for. I will admit I'm biased because I like tilapia pretty much anywhere I go as long as they cook it right, but my boyfriend seemed to like it as well. He also loved his salmon special with the shrimp topping (as did I!).  Unfortunately, neither of us were able to leave room for dessert, so I have nothing to say about that. Overall, this place is definitely in my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte now. The only problem is the parking, which is almost unavoidable whenever you go there. It's such a tiny place with barely any parking, but I'd rather deal with the parking than have them move to another location. The tiny old building, along with the jazz music playing, makes me feel like I've gone back in time. It's such a cozy, romantic restaurant. Definitely a great choice for Valentine's Day, and even my extremely picky, high-maintenance boyfriend (I love him, but he is!) agreed. Believe me, he wasn't lying. He wouldn't hesitate to tell me if I picked a bad restaurant! lol.",

    "text": "We came to eat to celebrate our anniversary (this as one of our first dates 14 years ago).  I called over a month ago to make the reservation and explained the purpose of our visit and asked if they could do anything for us when we came.  We arrived that night and were seated quickly.  Very crowded, very loud.  I didn't remember that from the last visit several years ago until we sat down and it came back to me very quickly.  The Waiter seemed distracted, but we managed to get our order.  The fried crawfish were great as a starter.  We then decided to get a few more appetizers and one entree to split.  When the gumbo came, we both decided it tasted like spicy water.  There was no flavor at all.  Even the shrimp had no taste.  It almost tasted like it was diluted to make it last the night or had just been sitting in the pot way too long.  I mentioned it to the waiter and he commented that he has never had it and that the main items are made in such large quantities, he didn't expect it would be very good.  What?!  Why would the waiter say that instead of \"I'm sorry sir, can we get you something else?\"  The rest of the meal was okay.  The Diane had more chicken than anything else (about 2 shrimp and 2 crawfish to go with three chicken breasts).  It lacked any flavor either and was kind of mushy.  The oysters were good and the crawfish scampi was good, but a bit on the greasy side.  The waiter never asked if we enjoyed our meal and never even said thank you for visiting.  He dropped off the ticket, picked it up and brought it back without saying word.  Customer service is just as important as the food, so that rates 0 stars.  He looked like we were in his way since we were only a 2 topper and he was losing money with us when he had other larger tables in his section.  The manager even walked by us several times and didn't even ask about our meal or acknowledge us.  Overall, we were very disappointed at the experience.  It seems like they are running on their reputation and haven't done much to maintain or improve over the years.  We have eaten here since I arrived in Charlotte in 1996 and have had events there, etc.  This visit will change my mind of a repeat visit.  Oh, by the way, no one even mentioned our anniversary when I specifically asked when I made that reservation a month ago.  That is a big no-no.",

The seafood gumbo was pretty tasteless and was probably the worst thing we tried all night. The blackened pork tenderloin was the best, but the meat was slightly overcooked. The fried green tomatoes and Cajun crawfish poppers were both just so-so. They were both lathered in a heavy cream sauce that would have been better served on the side. The crawfish etoufee was very spicy and the crawfish were plentiful and well-cooked, but the meal just did not wow me. Service, by far, was the worst we have experienced at ANY restaurant in Charlotte. Our server was very rushed and hardly gave our table any attention. Not once did he ask if I wanted another cocktail, even though i gulped the first one down in about ten minutes. I guess he figured that people would keep coming to this place (as evidenced by the long waits, even with reservations), and he did not have to do much to keep them coming back. The nicest part of this restaurant is the atmosphere - it is located in an old house and has quite a bit of charm. They also have a live band on Saturdays (and I think other days of the week as well).  I just don't think these things are good enough to make me want to return.",

I will definitely get tit again! The cucumber gin drink that was featured was also great. I got the BBQ shrimp as my main course and it was also very good. My date got the salmon special and it was great (Maybe a little better than mine, I had to try a bite!) I ended the dinner with a slice of Oreo cheesecake - yum.

With that said, I had bought a living social and few months back and we needed to use it. I made reservations for Sunday evening and we were seated right away. We were right next to the band and a Really large, loud group. That wasn't a problem, this isn't a quiet restaurant and the sever and party apologized for being so loud. If you sit downstairs it is not as loud,   I got the shrimp and grits, Col got the BBQ shrimp both really good and they give you a lot of shrimp. We took two slices of pecan pie to go. Everything was great. Our Server Alex, was on top of it and friendly even when they were really busy. It's a nice spot to go for a fun evening or if you're in the mood for something a little different.",

The gumbo starter was good but not amazing. The second course was a salmon in white wine sauce and the salmon absolutely perfect. It was a very generous piece of fish and somehow it was perfectly cooked all the way through. The third course was a key lime pie and was a nice finish to a delicious meal. The atmosphere was excellent and the wait staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. I will definitely be bringing family here when they come to visit.",

I got the etouffe with chicken, shrimp and crawfish but it was not as flavorful as etouffes I had in the past. We also got the toll house cookie pie and it was not a chocolate chip cookie pie as we thought it would be. If we went back, it would only be for the appetizer.",

First, forget the upstairs dining room, it is very small, crowded, and the Jazz group it is nothing to write home about. The restaurant would be better off investing in a good sound system and play a variety of Jazz including (Smooth Jazz) to make it more attractive and romantic and use the stage area for additional sitting. The best dining room in the restaurant (where we sat) is the one that over looks the valet parking area; intimate, quieter, and roomier. The one adjacent to it is also crowded, tables practically on top of each other with very little privacy. Now, the food was fantastic!!! The service was good!!! The very small bar is on the second floor and it took forever to get drinks brought to our table. As I said we made it special for us and had a great time. Would we go back? Maybe yes, maybe not.",

Then shrimp and grits, crawl fish and shrimp etouffee for main dishes. The gumbo was as good as I tried in New Orleans before. A bit spicy and rich! The portion of main dishes was great and the taste was even better! My craw fish and shrimp eotuffee was perfectly spiced for an authentic southern food. Loved the sauce and crawl fish was already peeled to eat. Shrimp and grits was great too. The shrimp was well seasoned and grilled perfectly.

I love creole food & can not wait to visit New Orleans one day for the real thing. Last weekend, my friends & I came here for one of my best friends birthdays. As far as being seated, we had a reservation so we were seated quickly. I had a hurricane punch I believe is what it's called. It was very good. Our service was subpar at best honestly. Waiter had a pretty snappy tone but I digress. Anyway, we ordered our food. Food took pretty long to arrive but being with friends was better because we talked the whole time. Otherwise, I probably would have been upset about it. I ended up getting a bowl of seafood gumbo & a salad. The salad was ok. Typical Cesar, nothin spectacular. Did have to re salt it because it didn't have too much of a taste. The gumbo, also extremely tasteless & the biggest disappointment of the whole dinner! Even the appetizer bread was better then it! It had no type of kick to it at all. How do you claim to be creole/Cajun but there's literally NO seasoning on your food? I tried to Salt, pepper, and Tabasco sauce it to death but... it wasn't helping. When I got the bill & seen that it was 38$, for just me, 2 drinks & my food which was only 12$, i was so annoyed because the food was not worth 38$ for one & for two, if you pay for your checks separately, the charge an automatic gratuity! So keep that in mind. Overall, I was very unimpressed & probably won't be returning. I'd definitely rather go to Razzos for their gumbo & fish bowls.",

    "text": "I'm giving Cajun Queen five stars because I have been dreaming of their pan seared duck breast over crawfish etouffee hitting my lips since the moment I left. This was indisputably the best duck I've ever eaten and the etouffee was an AMAZING accompaniment. The decor and ambiance aren't necessarily the glitz and glam you find in DC's five star restaurants but there was a True essence of NOLA permeating the air from the time we walked in. This was largely in part to their house band located on the second floor playin live music we absolutely loved. There are photos / paintings throughout the restaurant of New Orleans staples but honestly..... I enjoyed Cajun Queen's food better than most things I are while I was in NOLA.   Fried green tomatoes were cooked and seasoned perfectly and we ate every morsel on the plate. The Fried oysters tasted phenomenal. My gumbo was better than any gumbo I had in NOLA but I like spicy food so I added a dash oh hot sauce and sprinkle of black pepper that took it to perfection. The barbecue shrimp was out of this world, delicious. The sauce is soooooo good to sop up with the complimentary bread. Then there was this Oreo cheesecake that was one of my favorite cheesecakes I've ever tasted. Hubby thought his shrimp and grits were just ok but since our server was also pretty great, I could not find cause to deduct a star for that.   If you're looking for a unique dining experience in Charlotte that will make you feel like you've walked right into the French Quarter of NOLA without hopping on a plane or train, Cajun Queen is not to be missed. Sit upstairs to be close to the live band and utilize their complimentary valet.",

At our table , we had the Salt and Pepper Catfish , Crawfish Etouffee, The Diane , the New Orleans Platter and blackened chicken.   The gumbo was a yummy start but the platter babyyyyy. So yummy . I \"thought \" i wasn't that hungry but i ate it allll. The batter was thin but packed with flavor. Scallops , oysters , shrimp and catfish with white rice and red beans.

We were all super impressed. And the Oreo cheesecake is the BEST. Save room no matter what! Our server, MacGregor, knew what to recommend, and was polite and attentive. This beautiful restaurant is not to be missed. We checked out the bar upstairs- and found live music, art, and a lovely patio off to the side. I've found my favorite restaurant in Charlotte!",

The meeting was definitely the better experience solely in terms of food, everything was spot on and delicious - I especially loved the crawfish scampi! For my entree I went with tilapia which tasted very good.   The last time we went service was slow (it was a weekday), and the food surprisingly forgettable. We split the calamari appetizer which was pretty standard and each had the steak Diane. I am a rare girl but found the meat a bit tough- usually filet should be easy to cut through, this wasn't the case.   I'd say stick to your seafood options, give yourself some extra time to dine, and enjoy!",

The oyster app was perfectly fried and came with a delicious dipping sauce.  We ordered the fried oyster entree (which was overcooked) and chicken, shrimp, and crawfish etoufee (which lacked salt and spices).  For dessert we enjoyed a slice of key lime pie (not as tart as we like but also not too sweet).  You can enjoy live music upstairs in the bar area or sit downstairs for a quieter meal.

    "text": "It was one of those unanticipated nights, where a coming together of long unseen friends and everyday acquaintances coalesces into something magical. It was supposed to be a mens night for the men and a ladies night for the ladies, but before we could go our separate ways the men realized they loved the ladies and the ladies too loved their men and so all together we decided not to deny ourselves the company of the other sex. Unanimously, we wanted Cajun Queen. We were all already lit up from our daylight binging, so by the time we stumbled in we were ready for a good time. A milk-skinned hostess in a golf-green blazer and a white and peach paisley blouse batted at us with hazel eyes beneath a mop of perfectly tussled and pasted curls. \"We have eight,\" I said. She glowered. Before she could reply, I little-white-lied her: \"We called ahead... they told us to come right now.\"   Green blazer took off to see what she could manage; we loitered in the foyer, teetering drunk, glazed eyes reeling under the light of the antique chandelier. Green blazer came back and told us it'd be a bit of wait and recommended we hit the upstairs bar. We were already halfway up the steps.  Cajun Queen is one of those big old Elizabeth houses, southern gothic, eclectically arranged and echoing blindly with voices from some other era. It's a chatterbox of ancient heritage and white-hot with flickering, inconsistent lights that make you want to trim your mustache pencil thin and drink only from a snifter. Aroma suffused our consciousness and we all just became mindless, visceral things. At the upstairs bar, this long swan of a bartendress was commanding the room, elegantly and fluidly fetching glasses from the overhead rack, snatching mixers from the under-counter cooler, upturning bottles and dispensing drafts, all motions in succession, all so swift and natural, like something perfectly choreographed and rehearsed. She doled out a trayful of Olde Meck Coppers and we set ourselves to achieving the night. We were led to a corner table near the glassed wall of the little balcony at the back. I took a chair at the end, sat, leaned back, and rapped my knuckles against the abrasive texture of the mud-red stucco. Our very knowledgeable, upright waiter prattled off a series of specials and toppings of the day with juicy detail, but I all heard was 'something unbelievably amazing' followed by 'something else equally amazing'. I requested a couple batches of fried oysters for the table, and then we went in rounds, ordering our blackened catfishes and our crawfish etouffees and our obscene platters of shrimp and fish and sausage and delight. Without needing to ask, our upright waiter returned with another round of beers and a handful of waters. \"Good man,\" I said with an acknowledging nod. Huxley was sitting at the opposite end of the table. We had subconsciously retained the man-woman divide throughout the evening. I looked her way until she felt my gaze and when she glanced back I shot her a clever wink. She smiled. I swooned.  Our food arrived and we all collectively lost our minds. Remoulade-dipped oysters, creamy clumps of spicy rice, mouth-searing fish and peppery shrimp, beer and wine, more wine, and life and love and faces flush and hearts racing. We ate ourselves full, but couldn't stop. Flavors were assaulting us in such unmitigable ways, we were powerless to refuse their beckoning call of mouth-flaming, heart-swelling, eye-watering release. Ryan, at one point, shoved his seat back, sat up straight with hands on thighs, neck rigid like a scout-dog, let out a billowing exhale, momentarily composed himself, then jumped back in for another oyster and few more forkfuls of rice.  At the table behind us, a prim blond let out a squelch of a cry, half-stood, leaned forward, grabbed her man behind his fuzzy dark ears, and kissed him hard on the mouth. She held that embrace for some time, and all the lights and sounds in the room imploded in upon them. When her lips broke free from his, all the noise and clarity rushed back upon us in a crash. She sat down and knuckled a tear from her eye.  I clapped my hands and beamed across the room. \"This is the greatest night ever!\" I shouted out to the dining area.  Kathryn, a steadying force in our group, narrowed one eye and nodded at me placatively. \"You really enjoy the hyperbole, don't you?\" \"Get up for it, Kathryn!\" I threw my hands wildly about in the air above me. \"If it isn't the greatest night... then tell yourself it is, believe it, and make everyone else believe it too! Then it really will be!\" The prim blond and her man giggled, and a few tables around us applauded. I ceremoniously forked the last fried oyster from our appetizer tray, held it high like a chalice, like a triumph, angled my neck, opened my jaw wide, and brought it down mightily into my mouth. Kathryn looked around, a touch embarrassed, and then began furiously laughing. \"Oh, I believe it,\" she said. \"I believe it.\"",

I usually go for the red beans and rice and the fried green tomatoes appetizer, as there's not a lot in the way of veggie-friendly food...but I'm ok with what I get, as it's really, really good.   And, since I don't eat too heavy on the entree part of the meal, I have room for the key lime pie. The key lime pie is worth the trip by itself. It's just the right tangy and just the right sweet.

I ordered the special salmon with crawfish topping and it seriously is one of the best seafood dishes I have ever had.   The rolls are hot and fresh, and the gumbo is also really tasty helping to build the appetite for the main course.   I didn't get the bread pudding this time I went, but I have had it before and it is very good.   I'm always impressed with the service and the food.",

You can't serve red beans and rice with no gravy  and consider that to be a  Louisiana style dish. My husband ordered the New York strip and had to put salt on it because there was no flavor. I certainly have had better and I would not visit again. Overrated!",

We were greeted with, \"You can just park your car right there\" - taking away for the service that we are supposedly getting \"Complimentary\". Fast forward to the food - the choices & portions attached with their magical seasonings are amazing! The service took a bit longer than expected and two tables were served and received their food before we did & we had a reservation. W elect the waiter a minimal tip mainly because we felt as though our orders & the items we needed prior to receiving our food were not met within a timely fashion. Secondly, we asked a guy who was just walking the floor to see if he had an idea of how long our food would take. He said he had no idea; not offering to even check. My friend then responded, \"Do you think you can go & find out then....?\" He then came back & stated that it was on its way. The \"on its way\" comment was followed by an additional 15 minute lag time. After dinner, we were met in the parking lot with a different Valet Attendant & I proceeded to hand him our ticket for my vehicle. I told him, \"I can actually go & grab it myself because it's right there\", (pointing about 10 feet to the right). He stated, \"That's not your car\" & before he could even hand me the keys, the car horn sounded notifying that it was my vehicle & all I exited the conversation with was a \"Thanks\". I left him a tip mainly because he was light skinned and cute. Overall, I'd go back there. I could just do without the Valet & possibly a more socially conscious waiter.",

There is a bar on the upper level with New Orleans music playing while you wait for someone. Note that you will have to pay for drinks if you have any right there upstairs, can't put it on your meal bill. Just FYI. Downstairs, there is a nice gas fireplace that keeps the place warm and cozy.  I was apprehensive at first because of the cuisine type, not a fan of spicy foods, however, the menu has got variety for every taste: seafood, steaks, pasta, grains, potatoes, soups, salads and even the fried green tomato. No kidding. It was actually pretty good, reminded me of fried eggplant. Unusual.  Portions are humongous! I don't usually leave food on my plate, however, here, it was just humanly impossible for me to finish the buttery blackened chicken over Aveoulle pasta.   Solid four stars for bringing New Orleans to Charlotte.   Take the Cajun Queen steam boat Mississippi tour when you are in New Orleans!",

The fried shrimp was very nicely done -- not battered to death. Shrimp \"Diane\" looked yummy, with plenty of onion and mushrooms. My entree, Crawfish Etouffee, was really good (though I should have tried it with some of the spices on the table), but later on, didn't quite agree with my stomach. I don't typically eat shellfish, so that is most likely the reason. I would have tried one of the fish entrees, but they're pricey. Our server Bob was okay, but kind of standoffish sometimes.  The most disappointing part was that NONE of the seafood is domestic. Bob was amused that I asked, but considering seafood is their speciality, you would think they'd take sustainability and safety seriously. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.montereybayaquarium.org%2F%2Fcr%2FSeafoodWatch%2Fweb%2Fsfw_factsheet.aspx%3Fgid%3D18&s=57255d55579517fd969758e139f4caf78db56750837da1a5c69bcb160452514e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">montereybayaquarium.org/...</a>",

    "text": "Once upon a time in a city FAR FAR AWAY (from HOME = Chicago) a Beautiful young woman and her handsome husband were toying around on Groupon while house hunting  (The Queen City = Charlotte) and low and behold a deal for this place by the name of Cajun Queen.  Considering that we met in New Orleans, LA and my great grandmother is from the French Quarters and cooked Cajun food regularly, we have a distinctive taste bud for AMAZING to Moderate Authentic Cajun Food.  When you approach you would not expect the crowd that this place draws, I ALWAYS make a reservation on Open Table before going ALWAYS. It's a HUGE house that was transitioned into a restaurant and a HUGE house it is in order to fit that many people at tables inside for brunch, lunch and dinner. It's not that large but considering that it was a HOME it's HUGE.  The day we decided on land to build our home on we decided to go celebrate and have dinner using our Groupon.  THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST GROUPON DEALS WE EVER OBTAINED mainly due to the Southern feel, the TASTE, the SERVICE, etc...  I am not a FIVE star type of woman by far, I have to be pretty impressed and Cajun Queen has been VERY consistent. We've been more than 20 times now and I am just writing my review because I had to wait to ensure that there was consistency with the service, taste and feel of this place.  Cajun Queen is our GO-TO restaurant when we have family or friends visit. We like to take them somewhere that they can't go when they are back in their perspective cities that is also AMAZING and leave a memory in their mouth and mind.   We've had everything from craw-fish appetizer, fried green tomatoes, Fried Oysters, etc.. to Entrees including the Blacken Salmon topped with craw-fish and artichoke & sun dried tomato, Shrimp & Craw-fish Diane, Chicken Diane, Gumbo, Seafood Etouffee', New Orleans Platter (Fried Everything) etc..  All items mentioned are AWESOME, there are ALWAYS deals on Groupon however we go with or without a Groupon because it's WELL WORTH IT.. Be sure to make a reservation and if you don't be prepared to wait, however the bar area is small upstairs but a good time to say the least.  Happy Eating",

Food never changes same dishes for years now. Only complaint is sitting close to one another due to relatively packed seating but I can't blame them for maximizing profits.

The waiter quickly removed my plate, comped my meal, and gave me a fresh plate.  I was very impressed.    I would def go back!  Their waitstaff have certainly improved their skills with dish removal during the meal. And, they are very friendly and professional.    Great job!",

Got a little concerned when a group left out complaining about the wait but we were seated almost immediately at a table in the lounge (it pays to travel with a cute chick!) Not too noisy, good mix of hot and cool jazz that pairs well with the foods. Beau showed right up, introduced himelf and got to recommending dinners which was great for me since I know precious little about Cajun. We started with shrimp something; half-dozen shrimps hot off the broiler swimming around a sculpted lemon in a boat of crazy good hot barbeque juice. Lovely bride was quite pleased with the zippiness (flavory spicing, not just heat) of the sauce and got a togo cup for the left over bit. Moved on to Chicken Etouffee while my lovely bride had shrimp-n-grits. Well yeah it was good!! (as if i have a clue how it's supposed to taste) Moist tender chickens sauced up in a warm lingering mellow sort of mood enhancer over a mound of very ricey rice.  MLB was quite pleased with her dinner, thanks to y'all Yelpers who recommended!! Said it was most enjoyable especially as she had missed the bit about the andouilles. Finished the night with a delightful bourboned bread pudding. Yea bread pudding!",

They're a little on the pricey side bc we had two entrees and an appetizer and our bill was 90 dollars. We weren't allowed to use our Groupon for some reason that day. I recommend that you come early or make reservations bc they get busy early.   They even have a live band upstairs. I believe this is a good date spot in Charlotte.",

The gumbo looked like it was made from tomato soup (no roux) with only 2 shrimp in it. I had the blackened catfish & chicken with rice for my entree. Even with the seasoning they put on it, I had to add salt and pepper and ask (and pay $3 extra) for \"Diane\" sauce to pour over it.   Beware, they automatically charge 18% gratuity for separate checks even with only 2 people! When I asked about this the waiter was very rude and very defensive. I usually tip generously but the service and food were bad. I am in town for work and I will not be returning.",

For dinner I got the creole Cajun rice with chicken, shrimp and crawfish. It had the perfect amount of spice, but you can ask for more spice on the side! Most importantly, there was a huge amount of seafood in it and the chicken included two breast! It was so much food! My parents got the catfish and the chicken Diane. Can't go wrong with the Diane. My husband got it on our first visit and I thought it was delicious.   They also always have a Groupon. Make sure to check that out before you head here!  I'm glad I gave them a second chance!",

Just the right amount of spice, perfect ratio of rice to crawfish and nice portion size. My boyfriend had the cajun chicken pasta and oh my goodness, the sauce let me tell you...its out of this world!! I loved the veggies in his pasta as well. To finish off our meal we shared the bread pudding, it was great as well and fresh out of the oven. My only complaint is I would have liked more caramel sauce because it was that fantastic!   Now onto the ambiance, this restaurant is actually an older house. I love how they have things split into separate rooms, it gives it a more intimate feeling. The place really gives off a cool vibe.   Service was amazing, our waiter was super personable and friendly. He never let us run out of anything!   We will definitely be back in the future and I recommend that everyone give this place a try!",

    "text": "My husband and I are from Louisiana. Here's what we ordered: fried green tomatoes, side of red beans and rice, crawfish etouffee, shrimp & grits and I had a hurricane. It was great. First, the red beans and rice were good and my husband was disappointed there was no sausage in it but I pointed out it had chopped up ham in it. As long as there is some pork, it's fine. Tasted great. I tried his etouffee and it was perfect. I hate when it comes out cream colored because that is just wrong and probably made from condensed soup and when red, it's too tomato based. It was a brown sauce and very authentic like I make. Heat was perfect. I love we had our choice of La hot sauce or Crystal. My shrimp was obviously small compared to our gulf shrimp but still tasted amazing paired with grilled andouille sausage. That sausage was the star of the dishes. My husband tried to steal it and I normally let him have it but this time we had to split it. It was wonderful! The grits were a little creamy for me BUT they may be perfect for Charlotte natives. Both were really, really good. I would make some suggestions though. First, the fried green tomatoes were fried in fish fry cornmeal. I don't know anyone that makes them like that. The batter falls off and it's not enjoyable to eat. It's grainy and I would suggest if you do cornmeal you at least do it half with flour. This should keeps the batter on the tomatoes. The sauce was awesome. Had a creamy tar tar flavor. Loved that! Also, no one eats red beans and rice without cornbread. Why not serve cornbread muffins instead of hard white rolls? Im perplexed on that one. It's a staple and if you go to Nola, there's no way you would think this was right. Maybe a basket with both would be good. Or one as a garnish on certain dishes like beans n rice. Idk. The hurricane was too sour. The Pat O'Brien's mix directions do cause this but when you make it right then instead of ahead of time in batches, you can see the mix floating around and it's really salty. Fix that! It wasn't cold enough either. *Please tell your staff that it's pronounced, ON-douille NOT AN-douille. It's wrong. Aside from my suggestions, it was delicious and we will be back for sure!! I strongly recommend you get some andouille added to whatever you select! Atmosphere is nice and suitable for a romantic night, date night or even a family gathering. Service is wonderful.",

It was more on the watery side and bland to taste. We expected they would have good gumbo but it was not satisfying. Started with the fried oyster appetizer and found it weird to be at market price. The half order was so small and costs $13. It was good but not worth the money. The crawfish etouffee, however, was mind blowing. Maybe the best I had? So much flavor and many pieces of crawfish.

We decided to ride over and take our chances because the menu was so tempting. We did alright. We opted for bar seating to get service sooner rather than later (40 minute wait).  We ordered fried green tomato appetizer, an appetizer shrimp fried instead of BBQ style to go along with the chicken Etouffee, the Wash Day Blues (red beans and rice with andouille sausage) and we finished up with the bourbon Bread pudding. Every morsel that touched our mouths was delicious. The fried green tomatoes cooked perfect, nice crunchy flavorful coating and gently firm inside. The tomato remoulade had just enough flavor to not over power the breading. The fried shrimp were perfectly seasoned no need for the Cajun tartar sauce that Bo promised but never delivered to my sister. The Etouffee with chicken was New Orleans spicy and hit the spot. The chicken was tender enough to break with a fork. The portions were huge. There were two large chicken breasts in the Etouffee. The Wash Day Blues was a large bowl of Red beans and rice with 4 half andouille sausages. The flavor was authentic and not over spicy. I only wished that I had cornbread instead of the sour dough roll. Although, the roll was really good as well. Did I mention, we were sitting at the bar.  We were glad that Bo came over to take care of us. He did a FANTASTIC job! I will not to mention delicious bourbon bread pudding. We were lucky enough to get a piece fresh out of the oven, the peaches and raisin with the caramel sauce just made my taste buds SING!!!. I will definitely go back to the Cajun Queen and I recommend it to anyone in the city and craving some authentic NOLA fair.",

I ordered the fried catfish last night and got two big pieces of fish which was way more than I expected. It was well seasoned with a lightly fried coating which didn't flake. My husband order a dish (Diane something) which consisted of crawfish, shrimp, and chicken) which was amazing. We both had plenty of leftovers to go. Our server Justin was on point and very attentive. I usually don't remember names but he was awesome. I love the quaintness of this place. The Groupon deal is awesome. Not sure how long they plan on running this deal but I would go back despite the deal.",

We finished with the bread pudding, which was also unexceptional.  To top it off, our service was efficient, but certainly not friendly.  With tip, our bill was $95, and a poor value.",

My waitress Hanna seemed genuinely excited that this was my first time there and recommended several dishes, all of which didn't disappoint. Started with the BBQ shrimp, spicy yet tasty; sop the sauce with the bread. Next up, blackened pork tenderloin with fried plantains. 3 good sized medallions with an interesting bean chorizo sauce. The plaintains were battered with cornmeal and were very good. I also asked for a single filet of the salt and pepper catfish, which was very good also. Ended the meal with key lime pie. Overall the dining experience went well. I would come back next time in town to try other menu items.",

Bread pudding: I'm not even a huge bread pudding person and their peach bread pudding is outstanding - the perfect amount of sweet and savory. It's love reincarnated.

I get there and there is a huge sign on the door say they won't be taking the coupons during Restaurant Week, which is still going on.

My bf and I went this past weekend and I always can't believe that I don't come here more often.   We started off with the BBQ Shrimp, which had decent-sized shrimpies swimming around in cajun tastiness and it was just enough to leave us wanting more. I had the 4-way etouffee, yes, 4-WAY ettouffee with chicken, shrimp, crawfish and sausage and it was just what the doctor ordered for my spice addiction! My man ordered the shrimp and grits and loved his so much that he ate it again at home the next night! The etouffee was obviously meaty and spicy, while the shrimp and grits were creamy and plentiful. I, of course, enjoyed my meal with a Dixie's Blackened Voodoo (spiced) lager. Spice, spice, spice!  Bonus while dining at Cajun Queen: LIVE jazz music every night of the week! If you sit  upstairs, you will have the pleasure of  eating and drinking to fun music that totally fits the Cajun cuisine. The band may be a little too loud at times to have a normal dinner conversation but this is what makes the experience fun! If you would rather a more quiet dinner, make a reservation for the downstairs area of the restaurant or for a table outside.   Just a heads up: You may have to wait a few minutes before your table is ready for your reservation...  All the more reason to belly up to the bar while you wait. Duh.  The service may be a bit slow as they are always busy and the servers sometimes get a tad overwhelmed. But most aren't in a hurry while enjoying what the Queen has to offer so it's never seemed to be much of a problem for me.",

The crawfish scampi is my favorite appetizer/side dish I've ever enjoyed, at restaurants ranging from greasy spoons to upscale steakhouses.  Savory, delectable, and delicious.  It's the kind of dish I could eat every single day.  Make sure to soak up the remaining sauce with your bread.   I believe we have had every entree on the menu at one time or another, but my favorite has to be the crawfish etouffee.  Generous portions of crawfish paired with a perfectly spiced roux over rice.  It never disappoints. We just got back from New Orleans and had this same dish at 3 or 4 different well-reviewed restaurants, and none of them, in my opinion, bested Cajun Queen's.",

    "text": "We started off with what everyone suggested, yes the Fried Green Tomatoes and the Cajun Popcorn (Fried Crawfish). It was awesome. The green tomatoes were not sour and it came with a sauce that made it tangy. This sauce also came with the fried crawfish and it complemented with it well.  I ordered the Diane with all three (chicken, shrimp, and crawfish) my mother ordered the chicken, my father ordered the pork chop, and my brother followed with everyone's recommendation of the BBQ shrimp.  The Diane: absolutely to die for. It wasn't extremely spicy, the spice and kick came from the use of pepper and maybe a dash of cayenne pepper. But it was creamy, and with the mushrooms, chicken, crawfish, and shrimp it was amazing. I have to personally say that this was probably the best dish, or tied with the pork chop at least.  The chicken was probably the worse of the 4 dishes there, but on the bright side we did order the 3 good dishes. Next, the Pork Chop: This was awesome as well. The flavor was just off the chain! It wasn't spicy, but that sauce they added to the pork chop had a tangy flavor and then it was sweet as well. The meat was also well cooked, juices just coming out of it. Delicious.  The last dish BBQ Shrimp: If you're a spicy dish lover, this is the dish you should get. My father as well as brother found it pretty spicy (I did too), but whoa. The flavor on the shrimp as well as the rice was absolutely delicious (before the kick of the spiciness of course). It had a tangy sweet taste to it at first, then it just kicks back.   Parking was kinda crappy, but it goes well with the environment and ambiance of the restaurant. A house/restaurant gives it a homey feel, as well as a high class dining experience. But, parking and getting out of that parking lot is a pain. *Note, there is an exit/entrance at the back of the parking lot as well as the front to 7th street.* (But I would recommend to enter from 7th street)  I hope I have stirred your taste buds in trying something new and unique from Charlotte. Because mine was!",

It was similar to the consistency of Progresso soups, we could have saved these calories and yes it has shrimp, sausage but why is gumbo so transparent and without a hint a peppers, garlic, etc. We pressed on.  Our party's entree choices were all different some had Diane,  Creole and a few combined appetizers to make an entree. No one finished their meal. Only one person even bothered to take home their leftovers.  The hostess was wonderful, the waiter was okay - he was not happy very curt with all his answers, he looked annoyed by our inquiries about menu items.  He should have just said if you don't know about our menu then you should not be here-boom!  The valet staff was pleasant, quick  and accommodating - Bravo!  We will go back because all the other reviews indicate that we had an unusual visit. I will update my review when I return.",

Considering that I eat shrimp often I couldn't really shake the after taste. The sausage was burnt. Making it very disappointing. The grits however were solid. My boyfriend got the platter and he said it was good. And my son got chicken tenders. At 4, those are always good. I'm willing to give the place another chance in hopes of it being better next time. We definitely want to try brunch for the live jazz. It wasn't bad however it left much to be desired.",

We called and made a reservation for 8:45pm and were told this would be plenty of time to dine before their closing time of 10pm. As soon as we sat down we were rushed to order because the kitchen was closing at 9:15. Our plates were cleared before we were even able to finish our meals and when we told the waiter he replied with, \"I already put the dishes in the kitchen but I can bring them back out.\" The staff was turning off lights and locking up before we even got up to leave. We felt like we were intruding on the staff and an inconvenience so this made it difficult to enjoy ourselves.",

What I didn't like was the food. The food had hardly any flavor in my opinion. When I think of Cajun or new Orleans style food I think of tons of flavor. Also, the prices were a bit steep for something I could have made at home. I did enjoy my french quarter coffee! I would return just to sit on the rooftop deck and have a drink but the food was mediocre. Once again the service was great everyone was friendly who worked there. If you want good service and a great atmosphere to hear some live jazz/blues this is a good spot. If you are looking for delicious food you may want to try elsewhere.",

Atmosphere: While I felt it's a little run-down on the inside, it didn't bother me on a cold, winter day because it was warm and inviting. There is a fireplace in the front room that I wish we could have been seated near. Instead, we were seated in a back room that felt like an enclosed patio that had parking lot lights streaming in. Oh well. Live music upstairs would have been too loud for our group to sit near it and talk. Valet parkers were friendly and quick.  Beverages: Thumbs-up for some fun beverages. I had the good ol' Hurricane (didn't seem too strong to me) and a fellow diner had the \"Seventh Street Stumbler.\" Both of us enjoyed our drinks. While I don't usually order those types of beverages, it seemed appropriate at a cajun restaurant and I was pleased.  Food: I don't know about everyone else, but I was blown away by my Shrimp Julienne (?) - it was light, but plenty of food and DELICIOUS. I would highly recommend to others and would order it again myself. The bread is a waste of carbohydrates, so ask them to skip that. The fried pickles were pretty delicious and I don't usually like fried pickles.  Overall: I would return here on a date or with friends who were ready to have some drinks.",

There are lots of fun legends about the house being haunted. I know they also do live jazz, though I'm unsure of what night. Regardless, you may want to make a reservation before visiting. It's always busy.  Last night, we ordered fried green tomatoes, fried oysters, Cajun pasta, and the steak special. (It was a make-up Father's Day dinner.) All were fabulous. The oysters and the pasta were my favorites and the tomatoes were my least - though, still decent. My only gripe is that it is a little over priced. The portions are large and the quality is good so it's probably justified.   Parking blows.",

I write this in hopes of spurring change. The food was painfully bland and the rolls were cold. My husband and I tried the gumbo first. While the taste of the herbs rang through, it just didn't have that, \" started with the heads and tails of the shrimp to make my own home made broth taste\", that I would expect from a restaurant that markets like an authentic Cajun restaurant and charges the prices that you do. Same with the Shrimp and Grits-bland. The lack of salt would be understandable, if you were living in a nursing home. The mashed potatoes were over cooked and tasted like they had been whipped with water and the Diane sauce was runny. Sad. I feel cheated. I was my birthday and I picked the restaurant and was there with my entire family and everyone had that, \" I wish we had went somewhere else look,\" as the food started to arrive and I can not blame them.  The only saving grace to the entire meal was the pork chops and the fact that the veggies were fresh. When I pay these prices I want to taste the balance of flavors in what I am eating. I want it to taste like home cooked and the food needs to be hot not warm. It is like the food is being cooked with fear-like you might offend the elderly or someone who doesn't like garlic or a little heat. Why have a Cajun restaurant? Yes, I have high standards. You are what you eat and there are tons of other restaurants in Charlotte. The quality for the price is just not there.",

Next time will definitely try the bbq shrimp. I ordered the shrimp creole and salad my husband had the Cajun pasta and cup of gumbo.  Everything was great especially the Cajun pasta.  Next time I would skip the salad if ordering an appetizer because portions are very generous and the shrimp creole was full of shrimp. Only negative is parking. Which is pretty much non existent so make your reservations early.",

There also happened to be a ladies' holiday party, and, you know how we gals get when we are having fun.  Very loud.   So, we asked to be moved.  We were told that there were no available tables in the other two dining rooms, but there was space on the rooftop patio.  Huh?  We didn't even know such a space existed.  It was an unseasonably warm December night, so here we go, upstairs to absolute delight! The rooftop featured retro Christmas music, holiday lighting and a most splendiferous view.  We ordered a half order of the fried oysters to start.  They arrived crispy, with creamy Ranch dressing.  For our entrees, we both ordered the etouffee, his with crawfish, mine with vegetables.  Both needed a little salt, pepper and hot sauce, but, after a little doctoring up,  they were good.  As an aside, I have had their vegetable etouffee when it needed no adornment.  Awesome stuff.   And now, we shall request the rooftop each time.  Weather permitting.",

I recently was in Mobile, AL the week before I went to Charlotte and had some excellent seafood gumbo, still doesn't compare the Cajun Queen.  I am partial to the Etouffee has great earthy flavors with a great spicy finish.  I would usually get the Chicken with Andouille sausage.  Most recently I went crazy with it going with Chicken, shrimp, andouille, and crawfish, it was phenomenal.  Great atmosphere with live jazz upstairs.  Seating can be a bit cramped, but you can't have it all.  Make sure you get their Key Lime Pie for dessert.",

We arrived vie Lyft, so I'm not sure how parking is for the restaurant.  Our waiter did a great job , except for recommending the steak (I should have gone with the chicken). Shortly after being seated we were brought water and warm rolls with butter.  Ordered drinks were delivered quickly.  I asked the waiter for his opinion on the steak vs the chicken (as I'm not a big shellfish person, and many of their dishes are fish or shellfish or vegetarian).  He sold me on the steak.... It was okay, but not great for $30.  The mashed potatoes served with it we're amazing though!  We decided on dessert and went with the Bourbon Pecan Pie..... While the flavor was good...it didn't have nearly enough pecans in it and had way to much of the lighter filling.  My friend thoroughly enjoyed her main dish (crawfish).  This place is definitely worth checking out, especially if you like Cajun food.",

After finally reaching someone about the bogus charge, the response was \"It's because you used a debit card and not a credit card.\" Of course, this does not explain the charge. The manager never acknowledged what was done; even after we did. What the manager went on to state is that \"If we'd used a credit card instead, the waitress would've been able to reverse the transaction.\" However, it was OUR FAULT that we were charged over double what we'd actually ordered because there's a delay in returning funds when a debit card is used. I'm not a fan of that particular customer service experience and feel that an apology was definitely in order. There was no attempt to have us remain customers or to redeem themselves.",

    "text": "I was born and raised in New Orleans.  I have lived in Charlotte for two years and every one tells me I should try Cajun Queen.  I decided to try the New Orleans classic dishes to see if the hype met up to the real thing.    1.  Gumbo - This was not gumbo.  It didn't taste bad, but it was not traditional Gumbo.  Never have I ever seen a gumbo or made gumbo that was like tomatoe soup with no roux.  Gumbo is usually a very dark brown and the roux is made with love because you literally have to stand there and stir for an hour or else it burns. Then you have to start all over if it does burn.  This gumbo was red, red gumbo is wrong.  2.  Red Beans and Rice - The beans were red, and there was rice.  But the flavor was nothing like I ever tasted before.  The only thing I tasted was something sweet like they had a base with wostechire sauce in it.  It lacked depth in flavor you would get from sausage and hamhocks being cooked with it.  The rendered fat from the meat helps thicken the reb beans up, these were watery. This too was missing love. 2$ Popeyes red beans and rice blows this out of the water.    3.  Crawfish Etouffee - This had a dark roux in it, which in New Orleans it's almost always a light roux and red in color 99% of the time.  This was brown and tatsted like the roux was burnt.  It lacked seasoning and flavor.    4. Fried Green Tomatoes - These were awesome. No complaints.   5. Seafood Platter - The batter they use is very similar to stuff I've had at home.  It's a very light cornmeal batter that caked up on the seafood.  They were on point with this so I wasn't completely disappointed.  I did have a nice bartender and he kept my beers coming as I ate.  The service was great and the atmosphere was nice and the decor of the place was very NOLA homey.  They did have a jazz band jamming which was unique for this city.   To sum my review up, if you are from anywhere near or have frequented New Orleans, this place is going to disappoint you if you order any classic cuisines from NOLA. But if you've never been to the Crescent City, you'll probably think this is amazing.  I can see how people would like it if they never had the real dishes to compare it with.  I'll give them an A for effort, C+ for execution.",

I had to add a lot of salt and pepper.    I had the chicken tortellini and he had the etouffee with shrimp, crawfish and chicken. Mine was pretty good, the chicken was delicious and moist! My boyfriend said his food had no flavor. I tasted it and agreed. He had to add extra salt and pepper also!  For desert I had the bread pudding and he had the key lime pie. He loved his pie, he said it was one of the best he's had. As far as the bread pudding, I wasn't a fan. it has raisins and peaches which was pretty strange to me.   Our server Taylor was really good! Very efficient and on top of things even with all of the commotion!   Nice atmosphere but I don't think i'll be back because the food just didn't cut it for me.",

We made reservations in advance (thank goodness) but still waited quite a bit.  Upon checking in for the reservation, the flustered the hostesses informed us that it may be some time tried to get us to eat at the bar.   Thankfully, we weren't pressed for time so we decided to wait around.  After about 15-20 minutes of waiting (with a reservation) we were hurried to our table.  Thankfully our server was much more pleasant.    We ended up ordering a few beers and our entrees simultaneously due to our exacerbated hunger.  I got the Shrimp Etouffee and she got the Shrimp Diane.  After about a 10 minute wait, our dinner was served.  The food was absolutely delicious.  The seafood was fresh as were all of the ingredients.  It had that characteristic creole seasoning down to a science which I loved.  The consistency was not too thick or too thin but just right and the rice was perfectly cooked.  The only complaint that I have was that the portion size is not traditionally creole at all.  It was much more gourmet--very conservative--with dessert was barely enough to be full.  HOWEVER, it was still worth it.    For dessert, we had the key lime pie which was spot on.  Fresh, bright lime flavor and perfectly creamy consistency with a nice crunch to the crust.    It was a great birthday experience and I look forward coming back here for brunch to try some of their beignets and to experience their jazz nights.",

I had the blackened chicken and pasta special and my friend had the shrimp and grits: The portions are hefty. We both easily left a full meal behind on our plates. The wine list is nice. We both had a glass of the Silver Palm cab. Our server, Bo, was very helpful with our menu selections as well as tips about the area. Thanks Bo! We enjoyed the meal.",

My meal: Tortellini & cream sauce plain & comes with a salad that has carrots, cabbage, romaine, cucumber w/ ranch dressing. 1st time - Everything was so yummy!  2nd time - The salad was the best part! They over cooked the pasta where it was mushy.   French Fries- delicious!  Grits- watery and clumpy. Terrible!   Garlic Mashed Potatoes- Dry and had a disgusting smoked or meat flavor to it.  My friend's order: Diane- her absolute favorite. Lick the bowl clean type of good!  Shrimp etoufee- not good! Not the right seasoning, just like hot sauce was dumped into it.",

I was craving for some gumbo and I saw that Cajun Queen had some good reviews and I thought we should give it a try.   I ordered Gumbo Diane with crawfish and shrimp. My husband got the shrimp and grits with salad on the side. While his mom got fried tomatoes for appetizer, 8oz filet steak, a cup of gumbo, and banana pudding.  All three of us agreed that the food was delicious. I would highly recommend this place.   The service was good. The facade reminds me of an old historic home, because it is in a converted house. They redesigned the interior and, with a fireplace, it feels warm and inviting. The only downside is the PARKING. We came around 12:30 pm and we had to park behind the restaurant on a side street. However, after 5 pm, there is complementary valet service.",

Called at about 6pm and still got a 9:15 reservation. Parking was a bit difficult, but we will know better the next time. However, they do have free valet, we just didn't want it.   Once we got there, we were seated immediately. Tables are close together and you typically have to sit across from your company but that was ok. The waiter came to our table promptly, and we had water and bread in no time. We order and it was delicious! The food was prepared fresh, and cooked perfectly. We ordered the Duck and the Blackened Chicken and Fish! We literally ate every bite down to the sauce. We took home some Bourbon Bread Pudding and that was delicious as well! I suggest this restaurant only to people who love great food!!! Will be going back asap!!!!!",

I want to go somewhere and be reminded of the hospitality and the spectacular food of one of my favorite cities -- but Cajun Queen is not it.  I took my folks out for Sunday brunch. Our reservations were for 11am, which is right when they open. We got there a few minutes early and sat in the parking lot waiting for someone to open the door. As we walked in -- clearly the only patrons there -- we were walked through the quaint dining room with the fireplace and onto the enclosed back porch, all the way in the corner. The only people there, and they put us as far away as they could possibly put us. There was some sort of heating unit on and chugging over one of the windows. It buzzed and whined through our entire meal. Once someone turned on the music, it mostly obstructed the sound, but it came on so abruptly and loudly that the three of us jumped in our seats.   The food was fine. My omelet was dry on the outside and undercooked on the inside. The andouille sausage inside my omelet was gray and sad looking, but the same sausage in my mother's shrimp and grits was brightly colored and appetizing. Did I get the leftovers?   I've been with my parents a handful of times, and they're always pleased, but Cajun Queen just doesn't live up to my standards. The service, food, and prices are all acceptable, but I can't find anything about this restaurant that shines.",

I'm fairly new to this area and had no clue what this \"restaurant week\" deal is. The waiter explained it , however I ordered from the regular menu. When it came time for the bill- I presents coupon that was given as a gift only to be told I couldn't use it because of this event. When I asked to talk to the manager-Tim came to my table and completely berated me, asking if I knew how to read since there were signs all over the place about this restaurant week event.  He told me that there was nothing he was willing to do even though I didn't have a clue what he was talking about regarding this event- nor did I participate in it! He was probably the most disgusting acting human being I've encountered and I hope that he is not the representative for this very nice restaurant.",

The fried dishes I tried, including fried green tomatoes and some fried seafood, were delicious and accompanied by great sauces.  The typical Nola food didn't fair as well.  The gumbo was heavy on the tomato, and poorly seasoned, and the red beans and rice was virtually flavor-free.  I enjoyed eating here, but I wouldn't return for cajun food (I would return for the fried food, it was delish).  I might have been more forgiving with the food if it hadn't been so expensive (about $20 per person).  Oh, and the tea was instant or nestea or something.",

    "text": "I used to go to this restaurant quite often several years ago when I lived here in Charlotte. The service was always great, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere and music were very enjoyable. Needless to say, my expectation level was high. The complimentary valet is a plus as it used to be a nightmare to park there. The hostesses weren't very friendly nor was the front of the house manager when we walked in. We were taken to our tiny table shoved up against the wall. Our two top was VERY close to a 5 top with barely any room to move. Our waiter came over pointed to the restaurant week menu and walked off. I should have foreseen then how the evening was going to go. The waiter finally came back and abruptly took our drink order. He brings my wine and walks away without saying a word and then comes back 5 minutes later with my husband's wine. We ordered the exact same thing so why it took so long for the other glass is beyond me. The waiter comes over and rudely asks what do you want! I ordered the Caesar salad which was straight out of a bag with dried out lettuce and croutons hard enough to break a tooth. My husband got the gumbo and thought it was good. I ordered the etouffee with shrimp and crayfish as my entree and my husband ordered the shrimp and grits. The sauce was tasty and not to spicy. There were probably 5 tiny overcooked shrimp pieces , 10 tiny crayfish pieces, and a plate full of rice. The rice overpowered the entire dish. The shrimp and grits had very well done shrimp and bland grits. A guy came over and removed my wine glass without asking if I was finished or if I would like another glass. Our waiter never once checked on us while we were eating to see if we needed anything or how our dinner was. After someone else clears our plates without asking, our waiter comes over and says he guesses we are ready for dessert so what did we want. He brought the desserts out and let's say they didn't look very appetizing. The bread pudding did not look appealing but it tasted ok. The key lime pie crust was greasy and awful tasting. The filling itself was ok but didn't have much of a key lime taste to it. The waiter brings over our check and lays it on my husband's napkin and walks off. We hadn't asked for the check yet and he surely didn't ask if we wanted anything else before he dropped it off. We are excellent tippers as I used to wait tables myself and my husband worked in the restaurant industry. Our waiter did not deserve a tip of any kind other than to find another industry to work in as food service is not for him. We felt rushed the entire time and we were in and out of the restaurant in less than an hour. The area we sat in had 6 tables total and all but 1 of those tables was still occupied with people that were not eating or drinking when we left. They had already finished their dinner and drinks and a couple tables even had their to go boxes on the table. We were looking for a nice, relaxed dinner and that certainly didn't happen. We don't plan on returning that is for sure. We received better service from the valet attendant than we did in the restaurant itself. The guy ran over and got our car right away because he said he didn't want me to stand out in the cold for to long. He was very kind and considerate and was well tipped. There are so many great restaurants in Charlotte but unfortunately this is no longer one of them!",

We were sat on the second floor in front of the live jazz band. The ambience was exciting and alive, especially for a Tuesday night. We ordered the fried oysters as an appetizer and they serve it with a home made \"tartar sauce\" which has the consistency of an aioli and is absolutely life changinf. some of the best fried oysters I have ever had... Actually, THE best fried oysters I have ever had. And the tarter sauce makes them even better.  For my main course I ordered the Diane, with chicken, andouille sausage and crawfish. Let me just say that the chicken is so buttery and tender, they have you 2 large chicken breast cutlets over a bed of rice with a delicious lightly creamy mushroom sauce. Now, this isn't my first time at Cajun queen and I can honestly say I have NEVER had a bad experience. The Diane is wonderfully satisfying to your pallete. Another meal I would say is delicious is the pork tenderloin. Luckily, they serve such large portions that I have leftovers for at least two more meals. Cajun queen has become a staple in my house and anytime someone comes to visit we have to take them there. I highly highly recommend it.",

The setting is wonderful-- the restaurant is in a nice, big colorful house and its filled with lots of vibrant paintings--one of the rooms even has a fireplace which adds a lot of character.  The food is also very solid--lots of New Orleans specialties served by a very friendly staff. I had the blackened catfish which was very good and came with some nice steamed broccoli and yummy mashed potatoes. I also tried the fried oysters and the gumbo which were also both very tasty. Also, another highlight was the bread which came warm and fresh.  Would definitely recommend this place for a Nawlins meal in a fun, warm setting.",

We also enjoyed a refreshing Hurricane, because how can you not? I ordered the Chicken Diane, my Honey had the Crawfish Etouffee. My dish could have easily fed us both. Both dishes were busting with flavor, and had a little heat. The rice was cooked perfectly, and so were the chicken and crawfish...which is not always easy. We ended the meal with a slice of the pecan pie that was a sweet ending to a lovely meal. The Queen was clean, full of character, and had a very nice and attentive wait staff (our waters were always full). The presentation of the food was great, and the flavors were amazing. I am looking forward to our next visit!  We sat upstairs in the room with the band, who was excellent. I will say, the music is a bit loud to enjoy dinner conversation, but that's what breaks are for, right?",

It was such an exciting atmosphere. We loved it! My daughter said to us \"wow, were at a party\". The music band plays upstairs and that is where we were seated. We had a short wait around 10 minutes and the manager seated us right in front of the band as if he read my mind. That is exactly where we wanted to sit. I'm not a fan of spicy food and the waiter recommended instead of blackened, I can order the fish or chicken to be grilled and it was amazing. The popcorn crawfish was excellent. Beers were $3, $4 The whole experience was great, fun and we spent only $80 including the tip. I had spent more than double that at Villa Antonio a few months back for my wife's 30th bday and did not have as nice of a time. I would definitely go back and recommend to anyone wanting to have more than just your average dinner at applebees :)",

Bar area super crowded with one bartender and the speaker system screaming out reservation last names every few minutes at deafening decibels. No place to sit--and tarot card reader girl took up a whole table in the bar. Mediocre wine by the glass and only four rubbery shrimp (although the sauce was great--but we had to ask for bread after they brought the dish )in the $9 BBQ shrimp appetizer.  Finally seated in the room with music (which we requested and they honored) and the music was very average and too loud. We asked for water with no ice and the waiter actually rolled his eyes at us.  5 minutes later the waitress came and asked what we wanted with her order pad out, and we said, \"menus\". She finally brought some for us and the table next to us and left.  Another waitress came by and we asked if there was any way to turn the air-conditioning down since it was blowing directly on us, and she walked away without saying anything. First waitress came back and took the order of the table next to us which was seated after us and walked away without taking our order.  We had to call someone over to say we wanted to order.  They found our waitress and conveyed our request to her, and we saw her roll her eyes too. So, we decided to leave without eating since the charm of the Cajun Queen had long since left before we got there.....hard to park, noisy, and apathetic service.  Next Saturday, we are saying bye to the bayou by staying away from 7th Ave......",

For appetizers, our group ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes and the BBQ Shrimp, which were both delicious.  The BBQ shrimp is probably what they are best known for and it is the best thing we ate all night.  It is quite spicy though so, if heat in what you eat isn't your thing, you will want to skip this dish!  I have tried Fried Green Tomatoes several times at other restaurants and just hadn't found any that I liked.  These were absolutely delicious though and I highly recommend them!  For my entree, I ordered the shrimp and grits.  I am a huge fan of grits and cook them often at home.  I prefer grits to be creamy.  These were more watery and it seemed like they were cooked in chicken broth.  They were also not quite done enough to my liking.  The shrimp and sausage included with the grits were both dry and I just didn't care for this dish at all. For dessert, I ordered pecan pie and my husband got the bourbon bread pudding.  His was MUCH better.  The pecan pie was lacking something in the flavor department where the bread pudding just hit the mark on every level.  Overall, I would go back here again but would stick to the tomatoes and the bbq shrimp!",

A little bit of kick, I asked for it extra spicy.  I had it with all three proteins- chicken, shrimp and crawfish.  It was excellent!!!  I can't wait to go back and get it again.  My friend got blackened Cat fish.  It was good.....pretty similar to most blackened food....not exactly signature like I would compare my dish to!  His meal came with a salad or soup, mine did not.  They started our meal with rolls and butter.....I wish I got to try the bread and oil dip that I saw a few other people wrote about!  THe price point was close to $20 per person.  I do believe it's priced parallel to the meal, but I would save it for a slighty more special occasion.  I did not get to see a lot of the building- we were seated downstairs to the right in a section that was a bit less intimate and was kind of patio-like.  The other dining area downstairs did look a bit fancier and we never went upstairs, which sounded like it was the bar area.  All in all, it was a great meal and great spot!",

    "text": "Cajun Queen wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either. If you've been to New Orleans and sampled the fare, then you will be disappointed with the cuisine. While not on par with New Orleans, it's not without charm. Still, not the Big Easy.   For scale: 1- ingesting Old Bay seasoning,  2 - a box of Zatarain's, 4 - Cajun Queen,  10 - New Orleans.  The service was great, but we could tell our waitress was overworked even with the servers assistants refilling waters and removing finished plates.   Everything arrived lukewarm; gumbo, the \"all 3\" (crawfish, shrimp, and chicken) etouffee, and even the broccoli side. And although the etouffee cautioned, \"Spicy!,\" it was tame.   One winning aspect was the Sazerac cocktail, and New Orleans beer on the menu (Abita).   We'd go again for drinks.",

I was a little hesitant because I'm not real big on spicy/cajun food, but surprisingly I enjoyed everything about this place. The place is a house turned into a restaurant and has that cool New Orleans french quarter feel.   The fried pickles are AMAZING!! The Diamond watch out!! I had the blackened catfish with mashed potatoes and it was delicious. I was shocked that I had two pieces of fish as well which was even better. My friend had etouffee and she enjoyed her meal as well. I will definitely be back here again for some more yummy spices!!",

    "text": "While visiting the Queen City, I stopped by with my cousin and one of my best friends who happen to live there. Upon arrival I was quite smitten because the place is housed in an old house that has been converted into a restaurant. It was cute and quaint with lots of photos and paintings of New Orleans scenery. We were seated upstairs in what was probably the old master bedroom with the band. The service was good, the young woman was friendly and very helpful.  For appetizers we ordered fried crawfish and gumbo. Both were okay, nothing to write home about. I chose the etouffee with everything for an entree, along with a side of red beans and rice. My cousin ordered the New Orleans Platter, while my friend had the Diane. Both of my companions thoroughly enjoyed their meals and could not stop singing the praises. Again I thought my etoufee was just okay. I have had much better. I did, however, really enjoy the red rice and beans and thought to myself that maybe I should have just ordered that with some bbq shrimp and called it a day.   Would I visit them again? Of course, I always give everything two chances. :)",

I usually don't like to go during this time because, in my experience, this week has not given me a good representation of the restaurant.

I went with 2 of my friends (we're all under 30) and they didn't serve us the way he served the people beside us.  We first ordered the gumbo, which wasn't bad.  It wasn't as tasteful that I thought it would be.  However, using our bread with the gumbo, made it so much better.  The bread soaked up the gumbo and gave it a little bit of a buttery taste.  As for my entree, I ordered the etouffee four ways.  On the menu, it list three ways, but u can get four ways (which includes andouille sausage).  My friend ordered the shrimp etouffee.   As close friends do, we tasted the other and we both found mine to be better because the andouille sausage gave it a little bit of a sweeter taste that mixes well with the spices.  I'd recommend this place!  FYI:  There's sometimes groupons that make it a cheap place to eat! Keep a look out!",

They offer free valet which makes it a lot easier since I had no clue where to park and they will tow your car if you  park else where. The manager immediately opens the door for us as we approach and we got seated right away. We did make reservations in advance though. I was shocked to see a live band playing on a Wednesday night but apparently they are there 7 days a week! I enjoyed the live music and fireplace that adds on the ambiance. Our server was okay, he gave us bread and provided enough time for us to look through our menu. We decided to go with the Etouffee and Diane. Both had chicken, shrimp and crawfish. I liked the Etouffee but man... I miss the Diane already. I've been starring hard at the Cajun Queen groupon again because I'm already carving for another dish. My boyfriend just recently told me they are $4 cheaper if you get the voucher on living social. You won't be disappointed if you're looking for a new restaurant to try in Charlotte.

    "text": "When you're running out of date night locations and your significant other is getting tired of Domino's cheap weekday carryout deals, it's time to treat her to a fancy restaurant. Preferably one that constantly offers $20 for $40 online coupon deals like Cajun Queen does.  The location is very nice - it looks like a converted home with outdoor patio seating and an enclosed back porch for when the weather is nice. There's live music most nights and a bar upstairs if you just want to sit and enjoy a cocktail or two while you wait for a table.  The food was excellent - we got the Cajun BBQ shrimp as an appetizer and couldn't stop raving about it. Save your dinner rolls to mop up the delicious juice! Ask for another basket when they drop the shrimp off! We ordered gumbo too just to splurge but it seemed bland in comparison to that excellent BBQ shrimp juice.  I always feel bad waiting sitting through a waiter's shpeel about the daily specials and not ordering one so I ordered a steak special and my lady got chicken Diane. The steak was cooked medium rare as requested with craw fish etoufee and hearty mash potatoes riding shotgun. The chicken Diane's gravy was rich, flavorful and tasted fantastic. The portion sizes were enough to feel full and take enough home for meals the next day.  The service was excellent as well - our server was very personable and friendly. He make jokes, answered our questions about the menu, and never kept us waiting long when we needed something.   The entrees at Cajun Queen are around the $20 range which makes it really easy to blow your Groupon for a date night. In addition, there's a $5 charge for splitting an entree. I'll definitely be buying another coupon for Cajun Queen. The prices are a little beyond making it a regular spot (even with a coupon) but it's perfect for a memorable date night.",

The tables upstairs are very close together, but add to the close feel of the place! We ordered the gumbo to start, nice big shrimp and okra in it! Dip the bread in it, add a little hot sauce and you are set!  We split the blackened Mahi and chicken, wow! Fantastic blackened flavors, yet not charred! Flavors exploded in your mouth! Red beans and rice on the side were good also! Had to over indulge and order the pecan pie also. Came warm, way too sweet but delicious crust! Overall a fantastic date dinner!",

    "text": "Albeit they were a little slow in getting us to our table despite a reservation, the quality of the food and the service made up for the late start.  An appetizer of Barbecued Shrimp kicked off the evening awaking the taste buds and preparing them for the main course.   Of course you cannot let the waiter take any of the broth way from the table remaining from the BBQ shrimp.  That would just be wrong. My wife had the crawfish Diane, a delightful dish with ample spices, but not too much, lots of crawfish and fresh mushrooms. I had the New Orleans platter offering fried catfish, oyster, scallops and shrimp along with red beans and dirty rice. The scallops were huge, the catfish cooked and seasoned to perfection and well everything was just great. Our only negative to post is the noise level in the restaurant. It is very difficult to have a conversation at a table without staining your voice. The beer, wine and mixed drink selections were good although they were out of fresh mint so no mojitos that evening.  I recommend trying the place on a week night when It may not be so crowded and noises. You won't go wrong with the food.",

I started off with a BBQ shrimp appetizer, which had a great flavor, but the shrimp was a bit overcooked.  I also got a cup of gumbo, which I was very unimpressed with. Something was off with the flavor. Maybe I caught a bad batch of it, but I won't be ordering that again.    For my dinner I had the etouffee trio with crawfish, chicken, and shrimp.  The chicken was amazing.  Perhaps the best I have ever had.  It was very tender and the flavor was awesome.  The shrimp and crawfish were pretty darn good too.  I also tried some of the blackened catfish, which was cooked perfectly, but the seasoning on it was nothing special.  Luckily they had two of my favorite beers to wash it down with, Abita Golden and Purple Haze.    I like how the restaurant is laid out.  It has a nice ambiance to it, and looks great both inside and out.  The prices are a little expensive, but you do get a good amount of food, so I would say overall it's worth it.  If I had the option, I would have given it a 4.5 / 5 rating, but they definitely have some things to improve upon if they want to reach 5/5.",

Definitely make reservations when you come, as they only serve dinner (brunch on Sundays) and always have a crowd. They have \"complimentary\" valet service, and I would definitely recommend using it since they don't have an assigned lot. The live band is great and the service is very attentive.

I don't know if that's even fair, considering I grew up in Pensacola - 2 hrs outside NOLA - and Cajun Queen is better than any place there.  I also lived in Texas - another border state - and never found anything at NOLA's level.  Cajun Queen is a classy spot without being too expensive, and has a few items I really like.    The complimentary french bread with olive oil and herbs is better than you'd expect.  Take this tip - get the \"New Orleans B.B.Q. Shrimp\" as an appetizer.  The bread is phenomenal dipped in the shrimp sauce.  As far as entrees are concerned I recommend the crawfish etouffee, creole chicken, or the blackened ribeye.",

It might get difficult with diners trying to make the waitress take their payment, but they have to deal with it.  Feel it out, be a little patient if need be.

It was as delicious and mouth-scorchingly savory as I had hoped. (Warning: If you don't like a satisfying tongue burn, don't order the etouffee!) Most noteworthy of all, the chicken was fall-apart tender. Yum, yum, and more yum. My boyfriend ordered the blackened catfish by recommendation of the waiter, and it was just as tender and flavorful as my dish. Our waiter was also very polite.

I hated to leave there, when our table was ready. But alas, we were called away to a downstairs table. Downstairs, I could no longer hear the band. However, we ordered the special for the night.

    "text": "I haven't been to a lot of Cajun Restaurants (yet), but this has hands down been my favorite. Pulling up it looks like a old historic house. I'd never eaten in a restaurant like this so I was excited to get inside. When you pull in, they have complimentary valet. They work really hard so I always make sure I have cash to tip them. One weekends you have to have a reservation as they are normally booked to capacity. Immediately at the door they have someone waiting to seat you. And inside, the layout is just like a house! I love it!! Tables are spacious and the atmosphere is very nice. I've eaten upstairs once and I will never do it again. The reason is because they have a band upstairs every night. While the music is nice, it is loud. I left with a headache that one time from trying to yell over the music along with all the other conversations going on as the bar is upstairs as well. Downstairs you can still hear the music so I prefer to eat there. I've never had a rude server. They are always so nice. I've tried a little bit of everything here, and the only thing that I can say left me something to be desired was the BBQ Shrimp. Not that flavorful, wasn't really exciting, I'll pass on that from now on. The popcorn Crawfish is soooo good! So tender! They just melt in your mouth. I wasn't a fan of the shrimp scampi. While it was delicious!! It was pretty much shrimp served in a soup of oil and butter. Was wayyy too much! And the seafood Gumbo is really good. It has a small kick of heat and you'll get a couple shrimp in it if you're lucky. My favorite meals are the All 3 Diane and the Special where you pick your fish and either Shrimp or Crawfish topping. Just about everything is served over rice but I prefer Mashed Potatoes. And the hands down best dessert there is the Bourbon Pecan Pie!!! OMG!!!!!! Just think 21 Jump Street in my mouth!! So delicious! We thought the bread pudding was pretty bland though. Not much going on flavor wise, which was disappointing because I was excited to try it. Overall this place is awesome! Highly recommend!",

Our favorites are Chicken Diane and the Cajun Pasta.  The latter comes with a cup of gumbo or a salad.  The caesar salad is good too.  The BBQ shrimp makes a good appetizer or you can have for a dinner.  The wait staff is good too. We had Mcgregor the other night. Nice young man and on top of things.  Also, check to see if there is a Groupon you can use!",

It gets very loud upstairs when the jazz band is playing, because it's a bit small (especially on the side of the floor that's away from the bar).  The servers are friendly and the food has been good (e.g., crawfish scampi, many blackened selections and desserts).  However, they are a little bit of a hit or miss on the seafood gumbo... it had no seasoning whatsoever the last time I tried it?  The food can also seem a bit pricey, but I haven't found another Cajun place that beats this one yet?  In addition, they have complimentary valet, due to limited parking around the building... unless you don't mind parking on a side street across the street, which is usually what we do if the valet looks busy or unavailable.",

I guess if I preferred bland food or had never experienced authentic creole food I would have enjoyed myself or maybe not. It all started with a bad hurricane (not the storm, the thing the waitress brought out purporting to be a drink). This would be a one star review, but the fried crawfish was actually pretty tasty. Other than that my main dish was not seasoned well and they should be ashamed of themselves for using baby shrimp in $18.00 dishes. Even the rolls sucked; very dry and tasteless.

We sat in the back which is a sunroom. We loved it and it seemed a little quieter than the rest of the restaurant.   Bread- good but not spectacular. Side and Caesar salads- also decent but nothing special.  Great beer, wine, and mixed drink selection. They have a small kids menu and there were kids in the restaurant but it was more of an adult place in my mind. I don't think you can overdress because it's a nice (and pretty pricey) restaurant, but you can also come in with a nice pair of jeans.   For appetizers our group split the BBQ shrimp and fried pickles. The shrimp was wonderful, spicy but bearable:) it was large, juicy, and cooked perfectly (not rubbery). The broth is amazing especially using it as a dip for the rolls. Fried pickles were typical fried pickles with ranch dip. Nothing unique, but still delicious.  Everyone loved their meals with the exception of one person in our party. First, the good. I ordered the special for $25- blackened tilapia over rice with a sauce of crawfish, sundried tomatoes, lemon, and artichoke. HEAVEN! Huge piece of fish (I brought 1/2 my meal home) and it melted in my mouth. The mixture of flavors was on point.   Now, the bad. One man in our group is obsessed with steak and got the ribeye. The cut of meat was GIANT but it was pretty flavorless. It was cooked correctly but not what any of us would call worth $30. It came with a side of very dry, almost inedible, broccoli. But, it wasn't my meal (I just tried a bite!), so not knocking my review because of it. :)",

There are very few things I find myself yearning for, but the Crawfish Etouffe at the Cajun Queen s definitely one of them.  The crawfish are so succulent, and chewy, and they give you so many, that you can't help but chew on two or three in each mouthwatering bite.  I think the deliciousness is a combination of the crawfish, and this amazing rich buttery,  sauce they cover the crawfish and rice in.  Really Really good.  I also really like their fried oysters, they were fried perfectly and each oyster was big and meaty, and they gave me a ton of oysters with my order, so I was a very happy man.  Yeah baby Fried oysters and plenty of 'em, that's what I'm talking about.  The restaurant can get a little crowded on weekends, but seven  nights  a week they  do have live jazz upstairs.  The rest of the menu is decent, but if you go to the Cajun Queen make sure to try one of their special dishes,  with the Crawfish, you will be glad you did.",

I asked the bartender to make it less sour which is obviously sweet but it didn't make that much better.  We ordered and shared the New Orleans (fried) platter. If you like catfish, it was the best of the other fried items: shrimp, oysters and scallops. The red beans & rice was prepared differently than I've ever had; the add diced pieces of andouille sausage and raw red onions. Not the worst I've ever had but definitely different... you'll have to try it to determine for yourself.  Overall I give it 3.5 stars (rounded up to 4) because the people (diners not staff) showed the southern hospitality I've been missing since moving to Charlotte. Food was just ok but the catfish was worth coming back for, next time it'll just be catfish.  Sorry no pics",

My husband and I have driven by more times than I can count and have said so many times \"We really need to check them out!\", but sadly we never did. At least until about 2 months ago when some friends invited us to dinner and we met there. Afterwards, we were beating ourselves for not going sooner! We liked it so much we went back a couple of weeks later and took other friends to help spread the word! The food was as good the 2nd time as it was the first! I've been to New Orleans and have eaten at a variety of restaurants there, and I can easily say The Cajun Queen was as good, probably better, than anything I've had in New Orleans. Admittedly, I have a tendency to think that in most restaurants \"blackened\" is used to \"cover up\" bad/old cuts of meat or cheaper types of fish, but in a place like TCQ, \"blackened\" is a style of high quality, flavorful, great tasting food.  There's no doubt, TCQ is now one of my regular \"go to\" restaurants!",

So keep that in mind when ordering appetizers etc.  The Diane was good and the fried crawfish is a new fave.  The gumbo...well I've had better but others may like it. Everything though good during my visit was very under seasoned-but easily adjusted with a couple of salt and pepper shakes-maybe that's on purpose to make it more mainstream.  But regardless worth a try and I would probably come back.",

The portion sizes are hearty and will leave you full. A lot of the popular dishes like the Shrimp and Grits, Diana, and etouffee.  I had : Glass of Chardonnay, Seafood Gumbo, Shrimp and Grits with Andouille Sausage, Bourbon Bread pudding.  Bread for the table is perfect for dipping in the gumbo.  Shrimp and grits big portion of grits and medium sized shirmp I think I had about 6-8 pieces plus 2 pieces of sausage.   Keep in mind the kitchen closes at 9pm but the music and building itself stays open later ( at least for Queen's Feast)  Live Music is played upstairs but seating is limited so try arrive earlier in the night   Service was prompt and courtesy; even boxed up my leftovers.  They have all types of food even though it is New-Orleans cuisine so don't be discourage if someone in your party isn't feeling it.   Definitely recommended and definitely will be back",

She was able to help answers some questions and point me to some of her favorites on the menu.  The food was brought out quite quickly even though it was during dinner hours on a Wednesday evening. I had the Bayou Platter which consisted of the Blackened Chicken and Blacked Catfish. They were cooked and seasoned very well!! I also had the Peach Aloha, which was a good summer-y drink. I really enjoyed my meal and would recommend this restaurant :)",

I put a pinch of salt on all my food to make it perfect. Other than that no complaints. We tried the Oreo cheesecake and it was soooo good.

I feel like it's a great place to start to party it up at dinner (with a couple of Hurricanes in hand) or if you want a low-key, intimate dinner with your boo.. it's great for that too!   I miss Cajun food and this place did not disappoint! I wasn't the only Cajun lover at my table and we all ate to our hearts desire. Oh boy, were we full and very happy. From the apps, to the drinks and large entrees - I thought I needed to be rolled out.  I also loved that I was able to sit at a high top upstairs to be able to enjoy the live jazz music. Such a great add to the ambiance and dinner experience. It's not too loud or overly noisy, it was truly such a perfect addition.   Pro Tip: Bring some dollars or a $5 tip in hand because there is complimentary valet! No need to hustle and fight to look for parking in Elizabeth!",

Cajun Queen is set in a cozy home located off of 7th St. While this gives great appeal, it makes for a very challenging parking situation. They offer complimentary valet. I also recommend making a reservation, as the space is small and often packed.  The shrimp etouffee was very good. Slightly under-salted but great flavor with the right amount of heat.  The service was friendly, fast and attentive. All 3 of the attributes that I seek at a quaint spot like Cajun Queen.",

    "text": "After driving around uptown and going back and forth on where we should go, we ventured to Elizabeth and weaved through construction to dine at the Cajun Queen.  We have known about the restaurant just from location and when I did a quick google search I saw 4.5 stars and knew we were hungry and ready for a table so we valeted and went inside.  When asked if we wanted to sit up or downstairs a customer leaving interjected and said \"you have to go upstairs the experience is wonderful!\" ... so upstairs into the loud room with the live jazz band it was. We were seated at a 2 person table the similar to the arrangement of Soul Gastrolounge's and were elbow to the the wall and an unoccupied 2 seat table bedside us.  This left me uncomfortable for the entire dinner.  You cant possibly enjoy a full meal, apps, bread, cocktails and water (we ordered bottled flat) at a table of that size and definitely not when you have to awkwardly ask the waiter to remove the salad plate from the middle of the table when he served you an entree, leaving your table cluttered.   I had to ask the waiter about my cocktail that he's never put in 20 minutes after ordering it.  Also, if you're big on cocktails, this places cocktail menu is about as adventurous as a Myrtle beach chain restaurant with its only near feature being the names of cocktails like \"Cajun cooler,\" and \"swamp water,\" but doesn't have any craft ingredients and mixers get as complex as midori liquor and garnishes of lemon or a maraschino cherry. These things would not bother me if Cajun queen was a relaxed, quick service restaurant but this is a restaurant located a quarter mile from the Fig Tree and is in restored 2 story Victorian, and its ambience begs for a larger delivery than it gives. The gumbo was disappointing (how can you let an opportunity go at the only Cajun fine dining restaurant in the city) and lacked seasoning. The salad was a lettuce mix, carrot, radicchio and a large single piece of julienned cucumber on top and had stuffed in it a plastic disposable container of the vinaigrette I'd asked for on the side.  This confuses me as the gumbo was served atop a paper doily and this felt like yet again another missed opportunity. We did not see a ton of options aside from fried items on to the appetizer menu and wished we had more options.  I really wanted to try the fried green tomatoes, but after bread (served with plastic individual butter pods instead of plated - missed simple opportunity) and salad, we knew we'd be full.   I will say the 2 stars that come from two things - the band (who also takes song requests and are super relaxed, fun and personable)and the good entrees. I had a special featuring seared duck breast topped with a crawfish medley atop fried potatoes, onions and peppers and it was delicious - could have been a smidge spicier but I also didn't order it as so. My guest had the New Orleans shrimp which he enjoyed and it was super spicy and the rice was engorged in a soupy Cajun broth.   Desert I wouldn't know how to rate.  We got it almost just to mild out the spicy meal.  It was a nestle tollhouse cookie pie that you could probably get in the frozen aisle by Mrs. Smith and had spray reddi-whip atop it.  We wished we had gone for the bourbon pecan. Moreover, we wished we had just faired the parking hassle of uptown and waited for a table somewhere that would give us a better experience than the one that Cajun Queen gave us on relaxed Wednesday night out.",

In addition, the gumbo tasted like a tomato soup with shrimp and okra added. I was not impressed with that at all!  We started with crawfish scampi and it was super good. It has a little spice just so youM know but delicious with the bread...M y boyfriend had the pan seared duck (medium). It was cooked perfectly and the Flavors were tremendous. I had the Cajun chicken pasta and it was by far the best if ever had. Even great the next day which is hard to accomplish! I would definitely go back but do not recommend the gumbo unless you like it with a strong tomato soup flavor. I expected way more flavor after trying their various sauces but still a great experience! PS: When a woman asks for lemons more than 3 x you're in trouble (haha).",

She had the shrimp & grits I had had the gumbo.. Everything was nice and neat, served hot (We were the 1st there so no wait)  It was close to 12noon, we had finished our food and basically waiting for the clock to strike 12 so we could order a cocktail before leaving. Well it was was sooooooo close, (maybe 5mins or so) that the waiter placed our order.   I asked about the bloody marry (Muddy Waters), never really had one (Bloody Mary). The waiter asked.. ARE YOU SURE (with a devilish grin).... (see picture). Well after a 20 bet.. I reluctantly pulled the oyster out only to find it looks like some bull nuts (sorry for the graphic) But thats what made the bet worth wild.   Trust and Believe, I have video of me taking the \"shot\" (its really too much drink and biggggg oyster to be a shot).  Everything went well, the waiter found it hill-arry-us.  Cheer's",

The hostess said we could go upstairs to the bar. So we did. There was no one there and the chairs were already on top of the tables as if they were closing.  We went back downstairs and asked to be seated. There was only one table in the entire restaurant that had 2 people at it.  The hostess told us we would not be seated until our entire party was there. The birthday boy called the other people that we were waiting on and at the last minute they canceled. We told the hostess the reservation would now be for 5 and not 13. She rolled her eyes and looked at us and in a sarcastic demeaning tone said \"so you're telling me now that instead of 13 there were only be 5?\"  And we said yes. At that point I was ready to leave. But we stayed. The food was horrible and they included the tip without asking. I will never go back to this restaurant no matter what, even if they offer me free food three times a day for life.  I was so mad. I will never never never never never go back.  Horrible customer service and horrible food.",

Be aware that parking in the area is a huge challenge but there is valet service available. They've got signs everywhere warning that if you park in other business lots you'll be booted and towed.   I love that they're in an old house - the room we sat in had a beautifully preserved tile fireplace and I'm told the upstairs has a great bar.   The menu is a nice rundown of classics - jambalaya, blackened this-and-that, etc. we started with a small order of blackened shrimp, which arrived swimming in a wonderfully spicy broth. Pro tip - save those bread rolls they give you to soak up this juice.   Entree wise, I had shrimp and grits which netted me a huge amount of coarse ground grits with a decent amount of shrimp, in s nicely spiced sauce. A few of my shrimp were over cooked but the flavor was there.   We had no issues getting seated since we arrived at opening but it seems like reservations are the way to go. Cajun Queen isn't near as good as real NOLA cooking but it's way better than what most serve.",

The signature drinks were also phenomenal but this place is a must visit. It is located in a quaint house in Elizabeth and is truly the most unique atmosphere. Great photos of New Orleans on the walls and the staff is extremely attentive. We unfortunately did not get to sit upstairs and experience the live music but we will definitely be requesting a seat upstairs next time.   The meal was great. The fried oysters were fresh, delicious, flaky, not over battered and truly perfect. I then had the cesear salad and my guy had the gumbo. They were both gone in minutes. The cesear dressing is definitely made in house, great flavor, and the gumbo was perfectly spiced and delicious. Our meals were also phenomenal... I had the duck over crawfish etoufee and holy cow was the duck perfect. We also ordered the chicken etoufee... I truly can not stress enough how perfectly spiced these dishes were. I grew up in a large Cajun household and this was honestly better than the etoufee my grandmother made.   Unreal. We will be back AND SOON!  Thank you for a lovely and unexpectedly delicious meal.",

The food has always been great and over the years I've tried just about everything on the menu, never been disappointed whenever I've gone there. It's hard to pick a favorite since everything is good, but I lean towards the etoufee, the gumbos, anything  New Orleans-inspired. The seafood is delicious and always fresh here so if you love seafood, I would go for those options. If you eat here once, you will soon find yourself eating here often.",

I was able to make reservations on the same day with a pleasant interaction with the person on the phone. The seating is tight so be aware if that is an issue for you but not so tight you feel like you're sitting in someone else's lap. We did not have to wait for our water glasses to be filled and they never got empty. Our server Kevin was knowledgeable about the menu, pleasant, and accommodating. Pretty noisy so I would say family friendly. Great restaurant for kicking back and having a good time. Bathroom was clean and private so the trade off for women is there could be a wait. Me personally, I didn't have to. All New Orleans style dishes. Everything we had was good. I'm a spice person so I asked for the spiciest dish and it didn't disappoint: New Orleans bbq shrimp and rice. Yummy! Pricey but the quality of seafood and service is worth it. Oh and parking onsite is minimal but we found plenty of parking across the street.",

The brick house at 1800 E. 7th St. is 100 years old now, and it's been a restaurant for the last 34 year. A really fun and unique experience with great live music and authentic Cajun dishes and drinks  I just knew was a must try for me =]  Went there and was not disappointed! Great, friendly and attentive service and even better food! We ordered a side of Crawfish Etoufee, Shrimp and crawfish Diane and Shrimp Creole.  Food was absolutely delicious! Be aware they serve very generous portions so order accordingly LOL. I will definitely be back here next time Im in Charlotte",

I absolutely loved everything about it! The rice, mushrooms, seafood (shrimp and crawfish). My husband got shrimp creole. Again, the best taste!  I ordered a mixed drink, Swamp Water. The menu states something like \"drink if you dare.\" Do as it says, lol!!  Service was wonderful and attentive! Loved the live music playing up stairs. Perfect for date night or a group occasion",

I opted for the all three \"Diane\" (included shrimp , crawfish and chicken) and it was served over rice . Yummy . Just enough spices but a lot of seasoning and flavor. They give you a good portion size and you could easily have leftovers depending on how hungry you are when you first come. They easily accommodated us when we first arrived especially with it being 12 of us and the experience was good. I would definitely come back and now I will as many of my friends love this place and is the go spot when they are in town.",

    "text": "So I was able to visit Cajun Queen on my 1st visit to Charlotte in late March. Since I will be moving to Charlotte soon, it was very important that I found a really good Cajun restaurant to excite my palate during every visit. The restaurant does offer complimentary valet, which I gladly used just to feel fancy ya know but there was street parking near by that was available. The restaurant itself is inside of a older home with a tree out front filled with beads. If you've been to New Orleans then you get it. I had made reservations prior to arriving so I was seated quickly with a glass of water and bread.   I ordered a small BBQ Shrimp for an appetizer, which had just the right amount of flavor to make you want more & more. For the entree, I had so much to choose from but ultimately chose the Chicken Diane. This took me back to New Orleans & I've been thinking about it since my last bite. The portion size was just right & I ate on it for 2 days.   Ultimately, my visit was amazing & Cajun Queen hit every point. Now, I can bring my fiance here for date night to get the same experience.",

It was about a 45 minute wait for a table.  We made our way upstairs to a bar.  One of the appeals of this place is touting live music 7 nights a week.  It looked like some guys were going and some were staying.  I didn't hear any live music as I think they were on break.  Bar was full but we managed to find two spots together.  Bar tender was quick and attentive.  White Zombie and Copper were cold.  We started with fried green tomatoes and BBQ shrimp as side.  I thought both were quite tasty.  My only qualm is I thought the shrimp were a bit overcooked.  Bread was brought to the bar.  Nothing outstanding about it.  We were seated and our server was Nathan.   He made some recommendations.  I ordered the etouffee with all three.  It came with 2 good size pieces of chicken, shrimp, and crawfish.  It was spicy and I thought good.  Probably best tasting of the night.  Overall, a very solid 4! I reserve my 5s for blowing me away.  The shrimp being a bit dry, the lack of pizzazz on the bread, the lack of live music kept it from being a 5.",

The fried green tomatoes are a most have and of course if you go to a New Orleans style restaurant you must get the seafood gumbo. Appetizers range from $10 - $14 and the sizes are shareable! The menu has many options to choose from. From Blackened dishes to Gator! For my entree, I ordered the New Orleans Platter which consisted of catfish, shrimp, scallops, oysters, and red beans and rice; it is literally a sample the seafood that is offered. The price point for this dish was approx. $25 and it was very filling.   This place is unique because the restaurant is in a \"house\" and the dining room is very cozy and has a fireplace to create an ambiance. There is live music seven days a week and there is a small parking lot in the back as well as street parking. The ONLY thing I would suggest is more room between the dining tables other than that this restuarant is highly recommended.",

The restaurant also offers free valet parking so take advantage of it.   Our waiter was nice and helpful in helping us decide which dishes to order. We tried the fried crawfish as an appetizer and it was served with two dipping sauces. They were good.   For my entree, I ordered the mahi mahi special. This dish was served with a side of gumbo or a side salad. I opted for the gumbo. Although it was good it was a little too much tomato for my liking. I wouldn't order it again. My entree was plated well. The mahi mahi was good but a little over cooked. It had good flavor and was topped with shrimp and served with mashed potatoes, red peppers, and spinach. I chose to not get the mushrooms on my entree. I would order the mahi mahi again.  I was a little dissapointed that I could not get the drink that I wanted to order due to the restaurant being out of peach schnapps. Overall I would definitely return to check out some of the other dishes.",

    "text": "Cajun Queen I love your food, the cute quirky house, the music, and typically all staff I encounter. I don't love how fast you get people out of there. This isn't something I'd typically complain about, your service is too fast. It feels like the minute I'm done with the last bite of salad the server is instantly there to pick up the dish and has my entree in the other hand. With this being said, I love that the servers are so attentive, I'm just not used to getting through a 3 course meal in 40 minutes.  Unrelated to my speed eating issue, the food is delicious. Went for restaurant week over the weekend but have been many times before. Some of my favorites on the menu, etoufee, shrimp and grits, and Cajun pasta. The etoufee is perfect with just the right amount of spiciness, had the combo this time but the crawfish is my fave. Cajun pasta is delicious when I'm not in a major seafood mood. Super yummy night at CQ, just very quick.",

    "text": "Went to Cajun Queen today for lunch with a groupon. Was pleasantly surprised - had heard a lot about this place but haven't had the best of luck with Cajun food in Charlotte!   Parking was a bit confusing so we ended up finding street parking. When you walk into the restaurant, it has the vibe of a house flipped into a restaurant. Very quaint! Seating is a bit tight, but the restaurant is smaller.  For our appetizer, ordered a bowl of gumbo. 4/5  Then for main courses, we ordered the Cajun pasta and chicken etoufee - both were phenomenal! Pasta was a little pricey at $25 but the etoufee was a great value for $18 - including 2 chicken breasts.   We were stuffed by the end, but the bread pudding looked amazing.  As far as Cajun in Charlotte, I would say that it is the best and will definitely be returning.",

In addition to that I actually had a coupon which actually sweetened the deal even more.  We got there and headed upstairs to the bar to give our appetites a chance to ramp up.  The bar is small but doable and the furnishings are a little dated looking.  Not sure if that's the look they are going for but it is what it is.  Not horrible, just not as fancy as one might expect.  We then were seated outside and I actually preferred the outdoor seating.  It's on a low roof area so it's kind of nice with the view.  The food came out and it was fine, nothing I would shout about but also not terrible.   I think the issue is I just don't think the dollars to dishes ratio is in tact here.  Things just seemed a bit too pricey for what you got.  I'd come back but not without that coupon.",

Two friends had recommended this place for a business dinner and it did not disappoint.  I brought a potential client here for a laid back, quiet dinner where we could talk and enjoy ourselves and it did not disappoint.  The staff was very patient while we waited for our guest to arrive.  We started with the New Orleans bbq shrimp which were expertly prepared in a not too sweet but slightly spicy sauce.  My party devoured this dish and raved about it.  I then had a bowl of gumbo which came with my meal.  I ordered it sans rice and again, an award winning dish.  Spicy and loaded with seafood, veggies, and sausage.  I could have eaten an entire bowl of this for my meal alone!  Next was the blackened, 14 oz. NY strip steak.  Simply stated, this was HEAVEN!  By far the best NY strip I've had in years!  Perfectly seasoned, cooked, and very, very tender.  I'd eat this meal a million times over.  Now to the staff.  Very attentive and paitent and they gave us plenty of time to talk and relax over coffee at the end of the night.  We talked so long they restaurant had closed and the staff had begun their cleanup duties yet never once asked for us to leave, not even subtle hints like raising the lights.  They let us just sit and talk and talk and talk.  The dress in my opinion varies.  We were in jeans and button downs while some others had sport coats on.  A really good vibe and I'd feel just as comfortable dressed either way.  You will not be disappointed if you spend a nice evening here for your next meal!",

The place was packed and I was so glad I had a reservation!  We got there around 7:15 and people kept coming after us.  TIP: there is complementary valet parking so bring some cash so you can tip these guys on the way out.  I started with a Bell's Two Hearted from a nice little beer menu.  At only $4 a bottle this is a great value.  Then we split an appetizer of fried green tomatoes.  I was so glad we decide to split since it was 5 very thick slices of tomato breaded and fried.  The presentation could've been a bit better - they were placed on a bed of greens, but the sauce was just dumped over two of the slices and you had to figure out how to get it onto the other three.  It was just OK.  I've had better at The Roosevelt in RVA.  My entree was stellar.  I had the crawfish etouffee which was nicely spicy and had a HUGE AMOUNT of crawfish.  I am often disappointed with the level of heat and this was just the way I like it.",

I was SERIOUSLY planning to third wheel it and she didn't mind (b/c in her mind it wasn't a date)  .. but when she asked him about me tagging along he responded with a \"you mean she comes on our date\" Welp... at that point she realized it was a date (duh) and his ego was a bit bruised ... medium story short I never made it out there.   Cajun Queen is in an interesting location I haven't explored this part of Charlotte much.... only in passing. It's a tight space inside , we went at an off time so we had ample room but I wonder about dinner time how crowded it can be. Our waiter was super nice and explained the menu to us as well as made some recommendations on the spicy and not so spicy. I am a huge shrimp fan so I had the Diane with Shrimp. It was pretty tasty and spicy to me, and had me stuffed! It appears that they give you huge portions for your entree which is nice. I also had a side of gumbo , which  honestly tasted a bit like chili. This was my first gumbo experience so I'm not really sure what to think in terms of taste but I have heard from a friend who lives in NO that it's not supposed to taste like chili.   I came on a Sunday afternoon so there was no live band , and it was super cold so we couldn't sit on the patio. Overall I thought it was a nice meal and nice place with reasonable prices for the amount of food you receive. The parking is a bit annoying but I guess you can always park on the street!   Oh it seems that they run on reservations so I would recommend one!",

Cajun Queen, like many restaurants, has fallen into the category of \"why did it take me so long to try\".  Our meal was a solid 4 star experience, and it started with great service. Both my bowl of seafood gumbo and crawfish etoufee were full of cajun flavor and spicy, just like I was looking for. The wife got some shrimp as an app and they came with another great spicy sauce.  For her main, it was her standard blackened catfish, which she thoroughly enjoyed, but took half of it home due to the hugeness of the portion. Not being a fan of catfish, I didn't taste it, but rather focused on finishing every last bit of my etoufee.  Cajun Queen is definitely a little taste of New Orleans in Charlotte, and we shall return again soon.",

    "text": "Visiting Charlotte from Los Angeles while husband is in town for business.   The good: The upstairs dining room has a live band and lively atmosphere. People are talking loud and enjoying themselves. Have a drink before your dinner comes for an even better time. We each had a glass of wine. The sauce from the barbeque shrimp was the best part of our meal. Not the shrimp, the sauce with bread dipped in.  The bad: Food is mediocre. We had the Cajun popcorn, which is fried crawfish that comes out partially covered in a remoulade sauce. Good, but on the salty side. Tell them to put the sauce on the side when you order so you can dip instead. The sauce took away from the dish and the ones that were smothered in the sauce remained on the place, uneaten. We each had a cup of seafood gumbo, There is no meat other than seafood in the gumbo (yay!) but it was bland and the rice seemed undercooked and flavorless. We ordered a large order of the barbeque shrimp and I got a side order of grits. The sauce in the barbeque shrimp was spicy and delicious; dip the bread from your bread basket in this tasty broth. The shrimp were on the small and limp side; not memorable at all as far as texture.   The final insult: the grits. Grits are a favorite food of mine. I'm a southern girl and make real deal, bomb-azz grits at home. The grits at Cajun Queen were those instant, \"add boiling water to reconstitute,\" grits. Culinary blasphemy.  I will not return. If you want real grits, go to Mert's Heart and Soul.",

The place is very cute an has a very jazzy,  New Orleans ambiance which I loved. Our server was very helpful by giving us his recommendations. I was very happy they had Abita beer and other great selections from Bird Song Brewery (which I thoroughly indulged in).  We ordered the BBQ shrimp and fried oysters as appetizers. The BBQ was amazing and full of flavor. The only downside was it was a little too garlicy. Oysters aren't my favorite but my boyfriend thought they were great.   I got the etouffee and it was delicious. Generous amounts of meat and the flavor was great. It just sucked at the end of the meal when we realized it was Easter and our coupon couldn't be redeemed :( an excuse for us to go again, which we did!",

    "text": "We've been wanting to go to Cajun Queen for a long time.  The stars finally aligned, and we went - with great anticipation.  It was a letdown.  I could explain by making this a long review, but I'll sum it up this way:  The entrees are on one setting: smokin'.  I like it hot, so my etoufee was pretty good.  My wife doesn't, and she tried to play it safe with a \"mild\" one - the barbecue shrimp.  It was smokin'.  Further, it was identical to the etouffee, except it was more like just a soup with some rice - and the tails still on the shrimp.  With every facial orifice unexpectedly on fire, she sent it back.  They charged us for both the offending volcano and the replacement.  Really?  So I would recommend CQ as a decent place if all in your party like it hot.  If anyone is cayenne-intolerant, split up and send them elsewhere.  And if you send something back, don't expect them to take it off your bill.",

    "text": "I enjoy Cajun/Creole food as a change of pace and Cajun Queen has always delivered a good enough version of things to keep me happy.  Absolutely adore the BBQ shrimp with the only problem being the \"gravy\" is so good that I end up eating too much bread cause I can't stop sopping it up!  The gumbo is good though on my most recent visit it could have used a bit more salt.  Same for one of the specials we ordered which was blackened mahi with a crawfish, artichoke, tomato sauce.  It was flavorful with perfectly cooked fish and very lemony artichokes though.  Also got the Etouffee (secret... you can order it 4 way where they add andouille to it to go along with the 3 way version with shrimp, crawfish and chicken).  It was really good with a perfect dark roux and just enough spice to get my forehead sweating.  The shrimp in it could be better/bigger/fresher but that's a minor thing compared to the whole of the dish.  I've had the New Orleans's seafood platter before and it's deep fried goodness to be sure.  No matter what you get, portion sizes are more than adequate.  Overall this place is not New Orleans's good, if it were, it would be getting 5 stars but it's definitely good enough for me to make it a semi-regular stop when craving those flavors.",

Great food, large portions, relatively reasonable prices. Blackened fish with the topping of the day is always a good choice! I also love the Diane with all 3 ($20.95) - Chicken, Shrimp, & Crawfish plus Mushrooms, Garlic, Butter, Green Onions, Parsley and Spices sauteed together and served over rice. This dish is huge so you won't leave hungry. Ask them to spice it up a bit if you like spicy food. The dishes are a little mild for my taste. Try, if you can, to save room for dessert. The warm bread pudding & the pecan pie are delicious.   Cons:  - awful parking. At least they have valet now, but who wants to wait on their car after stuffing themselves with Cajun food? - seating is packed in way too close together. If you want an intimate date spot, this is not the place. - drinks are tasty, but a bit watered down for the price. Not the place in Charlotte to go just for a drink or two. - no ice cream. Seriously. How am I supposed to eat warm bourbon pecan with no ice cream???",

We shared the BBQ shrimp,  a little spicy for me but I love the flavors.  Hubby had the blackened Mahi with crawfish artichoke topping.  I ordered blackened pork tenderloin.  Somehow my order was messed up and the server brought out pork chop.  It looked so delicious, I told him I would take it.  Not a bad choice at all.  The gravy was to die for.  The only thing missing were the plantains that came with the tenderloin, which our server brought out, on the house. Did I mention the service is grea.t here?  The portions are generous; easily two meals.  We were stuffed but still got the bread pudding to go. I have always had a great experience, delicious food and excellent service at this place.",

    "text": "We went for early dinner yesterday shortly after 5:00 pm. The place was empty and the hostess tried to usher us to the back of the building to a corner as we admired the gorgeous fireplace and the empty room. We put the brakes on and elected to occupy the best table in the house. We then witnessed a small parade of people refusing to sit in the \"back of the bus\" also.   It was down hill from there. The waiter had the personality of, well, actually he didn't have one. The service could be described in one word, horrible. We had a groupon to rid our selves of and that's the only reason we didn't casually get up and walk out immediately. We ordered and within two or three minutes, our food arrived. Thankfully the bowls were warm and it was the only item that was warm. The food had very good flavor but the temperature was cool at best. We waited for a moment to see if Mister Personality would at least peek in on us to see if everything was satisfactory. Unfortunately, not to our surprise, he never checked on us the entire cold food meal. Normally, i would have insisted on a manager for some type of explanation but we decided to count our losses and endure it and never, ever return.   Considering this is a service industry and the waiters depend on tips as a return for excellent service, we wonder how he makes a living. My wife constantly reminds me of how I tip above and beyond 20% even when it's not warranted, but i took pride in giving this waiter exactly what he gave us.    I can only hope he was having a bad day and we found him in a moment he was not ready for our company. Maybe it was the electric blue shirt i was wearing, maybe? See where this is going? I'm not going there totally but it made us wonder what his issue was with us. Did we fit the \"stereotypical they don't tip\" profile? Well, guess what, we gave him the results it appeared he was looking for. Parental Tough love is what he was shown. \"Son you must treat everyone with respect or you will not be rewarded!!  Our experience versus some of the other revues here makes us wonder how the service industry has fallen to mediocrity being accepted as the normal standard. Sad, very sad.",

    "text": "Wow, I can't believe that I haven't written a review of the Cajun Queen before!  I guess because it is such a \"Charlotte Institution\" that I just imagined I would have written about it before!  Anyhow, this is one of my fav places to go when we actually leave the \"Ballantyne Bubble\".    We recently purchased a Groupon and went to meet some friends there for dinner.  While I love saving the $$ associated with groupon-type specials, I really dread going to the restaurant when I know that they are going to be swamped with other customers who are also taking advantage of the savings.  It seems that most restaurants do not properly prepare for the increase in business that will result from offering the coupons.  Many times, we have noticed that there is not enough staff to handle the increased number of customers -- so the level of service and also the quality of the food suffers. But enough of that tangent...back to the Cajun Queen...  Since there were going to be 6 of us, we made a reservation.  David and I arrived before the rest of our party, so we went upstairs to the bar while we waited. The bar was pretty full and I must say, the service in the bar area suffered because of it. It took a while to get our beers and the bartender didn't bother offering an orange or a glass for my Blue Moon, which was disappointing. But I had my \"big girl panties\" on , so I got over it and just decided to try and enjoy the beer straight from the bottle sans l'orange.    Almost immediately after getting our beers, the hostess announced over the loudspeaker that our party of 6 was being seated.  Yay, CQ for having our table ready on time!  And yay friends for not being late! :0  After being seated in a nice big corner table, we decided to order 3 appetizers for the table to share and went with the bar-b-cue shrimp, some sort of fried crawfish thing, and fried pickles. The bbq shrimp was definitely my fav of the 3.  I personally can live without fried pickles, but the other folks in our party seemed to really like them.  I am not normally a huge fan of crawfish, but this dish was really tasty.   Sadly, there were no oysters available for appetizers (although the waiter said they had a few in reserve for one of the entrees).    For my entree, I went with the shrimp etouffee - one of my favorite dishes.  It was spot on!  David had the shrimp creole and I tasted a bite of it - it was very good as well but not as spicy as mine. (I like spicy!)   We ordered some desserts to share among the table and for some reason, ended up with 2 pieces of key lime pie and 1 of the tollhouse cookie something-or-another.  They were both good, but I wish someone at the table had ordered a bread pudding because theirs is delish!   This would have been a 5 star review, except for the fact that there were several issues with the service thorughout our meal.  Nothing egregious, but a series of little things (mostly a lack of attention to detail) that detracted from making this a 5 star experience.    But, all-in-all, we had a great time and everyone enjoyed their meal.  So, with another Groupon waiting to be put to good use, we will definitely be going back again soon!",

I've been twice and ordered the Etouffee both times because it's very good.  It's got the perfect amount of spice that pairs well with an ice cold Abita.  The BBQ shrimp is a great app as well.  It's not so much about the shrimp as it is the sauce you dip the bread in.  Delicious.  My girlfriend was hit and miss with her entrees in the 2 times we've been.  The shrimp Diane was just OK.  It's a lighter consistency than the Etouffee and doesn't have the kick I look for when I'm in the mood for Cajun.  The shrimp and grits weren't good at all.  The grits were bland and the blackened shrimp didn't hit the mark.  Overall, I enjoy coming here, but the prices are a little high in my opinion.  They have a Groupon & Living Social pretty much all the time, so don't forget to grab one before you go!",

    "text": "This is \"our spot\". Our go to date night place. We've been coming here since we were in high school, class of '99, so...that's quite some time. Gosh, now I feel old.   There are several reasons why this continues to be a favorite of ours.   First, the neighborhood is utterly charming. An old home converted into a restaurant is adds a bazillion points to character of the restaurant. It's not brand spanking new. Nothing's been razed to the ground and rebuilt in that new minimalist style. I'm a big fan of repurposing without losing the original charm. I love love love that this place is still in a house. Take a chance to walk around the neighborhood if you like old historic homes. Some of the architecture will bring a tear to your eye.   Second, live jazz band. Do I need to say more? There's something about a live band at a restaurant. It provides an old world elegance. I feel like I've taken a step back in time. Like I'm Dolly in the classic movie \"Hello, Dolly\" and Louis Armstrong is about to serenade me while walking to my table.   Third, the upstairs bar and patio. One of my favorite things to do is get there 15 or 20 minutes earlier then our reservation and hang out at one of the tables in the bar. We order a plate of fried oysters with remoulade sauce, a couple drinks and just enjoy the atmosphere till our table is ready. We've had some of the best conversations just leaning against the counter sipping on sweet tea and munching on oysters.   Fourth, is the bread. Once you make it to a table (be sure to make a reservation or you will wait forever especially peak times on the weekend) you will be blessed with a basket of hot rolls. These rolls are the perfect combination of crisp and chewy. I believe they come from Nova's bakery, or at least that is what I've been told by the waitstaff. It's rare to get bread service at a non Italian restaurant or chain steakhouse. Again, it's a throwback to old classics and deserves a hand clap! The only bummer is the butter. It comes ice cold which makes it difficult to spread.   Fifth, is the food. I could say that food should be in the number one spot, but all these things listed prior are working together in its favor and is why this place is our favorite. The food here is a delight. I love heat and all things spicy. However, when they use spice, it doesn't over power the flavor. It isn't just spicy. It's packed full of flavor with a bit of heat that catches you at the end. One of my favorites is the chicken Diane. Sometimes I switch it up and get shrimp Diane or all 3 Diane (which is chicken, shrimp and crawfish). The Diane is rich and flavorful with mushrooms floating in buttery goodness. It is all things pleasurable. It is a mouthful of happiness and rainbows. Seriously, it's really good. If you are not a fan of garlic and mushrooms, then do not order this. Also, plan on smelling like garlic for a day or two after eating this. No vampire will want to come near you and your lover may avoid your kisses if you don't pop a mint. Trust me. Dragon breath is imminent.   The blackened chicken is well seasoned and not dried out. It is hard to blacken chicken breast meat and still have it juicy but they nail it every time. The blackened catfish is a favorite and is a huge portion. In fact, almost all the dishes here are giant and unless you are The Rock (can you smell what The Rock is cookin'?), you might be taking home a box or two of leftovers.  Definitely try the fried oysters with remoulade. They are lightly breaded and fried. Every time we visit we just have to order them. They are tender and sweet. Perfect start to the meal.   I've had the gumbo a couple of times as a starter. I love gumbo and the one here is good. It's not the best gumbo I've ever had but it's not the worst. I like okra and andouille sausage in addition to the shrimp and I don't think I've ever had a bowl with any of those in it. However, the rice is perfectly cooked every time. So, the gumbo might be a gamble.   They do have a decent Ceasar salad for a starter. Nothing fancy. Just a good salad.   I'm usually too full for dessert, but we have had the bread pudding and the key lime pie. Both are a great way to end the meal but I'd rather have the plate of oysters.   For all the reasons stated above, this place holds the number one spot in our date nights. Cajun Queen Forever!!   P.s. - I miss seeing queen gator. :*(",

    "text": "So about 10 years ago I was taken to Cajun Queen by some friends when I moved here to Charlotte from Chicago. Remembering that I was not crazy about it, I still was open to going again to re try it. I searched through all the Yelp reviews to see what to order and what was the best.  First...this old House or Restaurant should be updated..obviously with the amount of people in it  at the time I left...they have the money. Stair case is wiggley..and it is just plain old..Not quaint and old ..just old. We were a big party and we had a good server named IVY, but the food left lots to be desired. We were kindly treated by our hosts to almost ever single one of the appetizers to begin with. This started with Fried Oysters that were for sure fried a couple of days ago and then reheated in a microwave! ..Fried Green tomatoes were straight out of frozen bag and not fried..just barely baked..still cold in the middle..very bland. The New Orleans style Barbequed Shrimp....tiny little salad size and in the same sauce that everything including the gumbo had.  I am going to spare you anymore..but to tell you It will for sure be another 10 years before I go back...thank goodness the company was fantastic!!",

I started with a very delicious key line Martini and the popcorn  crawfish both a sweet treat. The crawfish for sure should not be missed. Next course was a very fresh and impeccably spice cup of gumbo. For my main course I chose from the specials menu a piece of Mahi Mahi topped with shrimp taoso ham roasted red peppers and mushrooms served over garlic mashed potatoes.  The presentation was beautiful and the taste divine. All if the seafood was extremely fresh.   My husband chose this Resturant to celebrate our Anniversary and I am very pleased with his choice.",

The upgrade is largely due to the fact that this time we sat upstairs & enjoyed some great live jazz! Also, my husband got the same dish as last time (crawfish & shrimp etouffee) & called it one of his \"favorite dishes ever\" & I tried something new (shrimp creole) & loved it just as much as the dish I got the first time (shrimp Diane). The walls are adorned with great photos of NOLA, the home where the restaurant lives is beautiful, & the service is good. The free valet is a nice touch as street parking in at a premium in the neighborhood. Check out Cajun Queen!",

    "text": "I have been in Charlotte for over three years and had never been to Cajun Queen, but I have been listening to Jazz a lot lately and got in the mood for some live Jazz. From what I have been able to find, this is the only place in Charlotte that even has live Jazz, so I booked a reservation (through OpenTable) for my girlfriend and I on a Saturday night.  No problems with the reservation or getting us seated as soon as we got there, but I was immediately disappointed to find out that the music was only upstairs and there would be a \"20-30 minute wait\" for seating upstairs. We were seated downstairs, right next to the entrance--it's not great seeing everyone come and go, as well as the staff milling about the hostess stand.  Our dinner started with no live Jazz (from downstairs it sounded like pots/pans being banged together) and less than ideal seating. Then came the food. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't anything special. Certainly not good enough to warrant all of the rave reviews here or the prices they charge. It was seasoned, but still tasted very bland to me, especially the crawfish, which I thought was overcooked. The seasoning certainly did not taste Cajun to me. (I got the crawfish Creole and my girlfriend had the chicken Etouffee.)  I was definitely not pleased with my first--and last--experience at Cajun Queen, and left $60 poorer and hungry for better food, although I was full. Given that \"Live Jazz 7 nights a week\" is prominently touted on their website header, they really need to specify that it is only upstairs. I would have requested upstairs seating when I made the reservation, if I had known that was the only place to hear the music. Either that, or they need to remodel that old, bland house to open it up more.  Bottom line: I will not be going back.",

It wasn't horrible but it wasn't memorable. I wish I could write about the service or the exact taste of the food but it was simply meh. I got the Blackened Catfish Filet with mashed taters (which I do remember and were fabulous) but I think they forgot the blackening on it or don't know what blackening means. I had to put some hot sauce on there just to get a kick.  It's a charming place however they had some live music which I personally found loud (and this moment right here is when I turned old).If you're looking for authentic New Orleans style food like I was, I would pass.",

So when my gumbo came it tasted blah to me. Not very flavorful.  So my dad ate it and liked it. My shrimp and grits were ok but the shrimp was bland and the skin on my sausage was hard. My sister had the dish several times before and said it didn't taste the same. Liked the grits though. tasted the blackened catfish... moist and delicious. Tasty desserts, but nothing to write home about. I do think it's a bit overpriced.   The restroom paper towel machine was broken. And no other dryer or towels available. I know is out of their control but maybe need a backup.  It's quite annoying.  Great place for appetizers, live jazz and drinks.",

We also enjoyed their pecan pie and key lime pie...both quite tasty.   The meal was excellent the server was excellent also!    We will definitely visit again...",

The fried oysters were cold in the middle.  My favorite New Orleans Platter lacked flavor.  The restaurant was not crowded so they have no excuse for such bad food.  No one at my table had a delicious meal.   The server was not too good either. Normally enjoy this place...but not too much on this visit.",

Great meal, great srevice and as usual great atmosphere. Look forward to our next visit.",

    "text": "Mmmm-mmm! I definitely picked the right place for my birthday dinner. We showed up slightly early and got to mingle in the bar for a few minutes- what a fun bar! I'm going to have to go back just for that alone. Then we were seated in the downstairs porch/sun room, or as my grandmother would say, \"on the veranda.\"  We had some trouble communicating with our server- one guest was late, and I think he was waiting on her to get there before we ordered drinks, but I can't hold that against him as he was just triple-sat. Next time I'll be clearer- alcohol now!  They have a great drink selection, including creatively-named specialty cocktails. I was tempted to order the \"Seventh Street Stumbler\" and see if it held up to it's name, but in the end, a glass (um, or three) of white wine went well with my dinner.  The food was out of this world! We had the fried green tomato appetizer and devoured it. For entrees, I had the blackened salmon special with crawfish and artichokes, and my friends had the catfish, the chicken Diane, and the shrimp and grits, and we were all so busy making yummy noises no one could talk. I think we planned to try each others but they all disappeared so quickly we never got around to it.   We were too stuffed for dessert but that bourbon bread pudding is calling my name for next time. And there will be a next time.",

    "text": "I want to love Cajun Queen, I really do. I try to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt when they fall short, understanding that things happen sometimes outside of their control. That said, Cajun Queen has continually failed to provide a satisfactory dining experience for us on 3 consecutive visits. The food alone would earn 4 stars for the advertised menu prices - although they do offer special discount deals fairly often. The customer service however is consistently dissapointing, to the point where I am convinced that the management staff needs to be changed. The attitude toward customers is not one of \"How can I help make your experience better?\" it instead seems to me that all of the workers are more into talking to eachother while dropping items at tables without saying a word. This is not just one bad egg, it seems to be everyone from the water boy to the manager. A friendly restaurant employee is the exception to the rule at Cajun Queen. In my opinion the lack of customer service ability is a direct result of the management failing to instill those abilities in their employees.   If you get seated at the two person table in a hallway between the kitchen and 2 dining rooms just ask to be moved. That table is terrible and does not belong in any restaurant that has any respect for its customers. And that's just it, there seems to be a lack of respect amongst the staff for their customers here. The hostess at the door stares at her computer while talking to you without ever making eye contact, the bread boy just drops the bread at your table without a word. Water boy, same thing. Server doesn't exchange pleasantries, just straight to drinks and apps. Manager walks by and talks to his buddy about the game but doesn't acknowledge the guest at the table as his conversation is overpowering ours. Workers come barelling through with a table they are moving without saying 'pardon me' or anything at all. On the way out the door the manager guy just stands there staring at the hostess' computer screen without so much as saying thanks have a good night...  We have kept returning to Cajun Queen always hoping our next experience would prove to be better, but sadly I think we have now given up. The food earns a 4 star recomendation and it is worth experiencing, but the service is 2 star at best.",

From the cozy atmosphere inside (which offers the same fun and authentic feeling of any fine restaurant located on Bourbon Street), to the jazz band playing upstairs, all the way down to the blackened items listed on their menu, this place has made my trip worthwhile every time.  You can usually find a \"Groupon\" online before heading out which will make your visit a little lighter on the wallet -  or in my case allow for a few more drinks from their New Orleans style drink selections. That's just my two cents! i hope this review helps and I encourage you to give this big two story house with the large green gator out front a try if Cajun cooking sounds good to you.",

However, without the Groupon this restaurant's service and quality do not match up to the price on the menu. Additionally, there was no live music (which is mentioned as a drawing card in most reviews). We visited on a Saturday night at 9pm.",

Every single staff member that past by spoke and was pleasant! They escorted us in and did whatever it took for us to be comfortable as my friend uses a wheel chair. They made space where there wasn't space and made sure that we were happy! I was floored!!!!

    "text": "Everytime we drive down 7th Street and I see that Crocodile standing in front of Cajun Queen felt I had to go.  I love a good jazz place!!  Well finally after 10 years in Charlotte and thanks to a Groupon we finally went to Cajun Queen on a Saturday night, at 5:00 pm mind you.  Not even the dinner crowd, but the senior crowd.  We arrive before 5:00 only to be confused with the parking lot.  Directly behind the Cajun Queen there must be MAYBE 8 spots and next to the Cajun Queen is a hair salon with an empty parking lot that doesn't want to allow people to park there while they are clearly closed...ahem, I digress.  The Cajun Queen valet did run over to us before we sealed our fate with the eternal fate of a parking boot (I think the hair dresser has a camera watching from a remote area...just saying).  We ending up parking across the street.  Not too bad, luckily there wasn't heavy traffic because my slow poke kid was with us. It was super crowded, even at 5:00 pm.  Luckily we made a reservation.    They seated us upstairs which I thought :WOW !!That's neat, it's going to lovely up there.\"  Well, not so much.  There are too many tables for too small of a space.  I was butt up against the buffett where the servers were clearly trying to maneuver around me to get their extra plates, water, etc. I think if they would get rid of 3 or 4 tables it would have been a better atmosphere.  The servers were always trying their best to get around the crowded room. The tables are small and wobbly.  Just for a joint like this, I expect better.   Being such a small place it was extra noisey, not from the jazz band, but just from people laughing extra hard, or talking super loud, or what have you.  No close intimate dinners for you!  Our poor server was a bit slow on getting our order and taking care of us.  I just think Cajun Queen tries to do too much with too little.    On to the food!  Well after several minutes of \"I don't like anything and I don't want shrimp\", our pickiest of eaters chose mashed potatoes and sausage (two sides) as his meal.  Guess what folks?  He actually liked it and ate half of it.  He was trying to convince us of getting a 16 ounce steak. We laughed at that one...well my husband and I anyway, picky eater was convinced he could eat a whole steak.  HHAHAHA.  I had the gumbo and house salad, my husband and other kid had shrimp diane.  All which were pretty darn good.     The jazz band came after we had dessert.  They were cute and not too loud which amazed me because we were one table away from the stage.  So meh, we won't be back.  For a family of four it came to around $80.00 including 2 sodas, and 2 desserts, but not including the Groupon.",

We ate outside, which was nice, although we missed hearing the live jazz band.   Lengthy cocktail menu with lots of great New Orleans favorites like hurricanes, swamp water, and such.   We had the fried green tomatoes, gumbo, and etoufee. Very delicious!   Our waitress was really attentive and nice. Excellent server.   Parking seemed a little daunting at first, but luckily, we scrounged up some cash (we're usually a debit card-only household) so we could tip the valet guys. Valet itself is free.   We will be back!",

Upon arrival, the service was great and even asked us if we made reservation.  You can make a reservation through Yelp if you wish to!    Another great thing about this place is I was able to find a Groupon deal which definitely helped($25 for $40 worth).  I got the Shrimp Scampi which was very well done!  The shrimp was soft and tender and the tail was still on!  I also got the fried pickles which were just delicious!   Overall, I had a great experience and would definitely recommend it if you are in the area!",

I know my fellow diners had fantastic meals, however my 3 star rating is for their lack of vegetarian dishes. There wasn't anything on the menu (aside from ordering a plate full of sides and that get really old) so the waiter suggested the one item they had available for veggie friendly patrons. It was sufficient but not something I would normally order. Either way, I would certainly go back if there were a few more entree options for peeps like me.",

The bar was packed and had only one bartender, so it was also very slow.  That said, the food was really AMAZING. Best Cajun place outside of New Orleans, by far. Definitely worth a visit.

The sauce that they are made in is great for dipping the complimentary rolls into.  It's spicy but not too hot even though we typically enjoy hot and spicy food.  Entrees... Fried Catfish and red beans and rice were the only downfalls. The red beans and rice lacked seasoning. The catfish was not cooked crispy. It was extremely wet and flimsy. I returned it and it came out hot and crispy! Crawfish, shrimp, chicken Diane was amazing and Extremely flavorful!  All in all I will be visiting this restaurant again when in Charlotte.",

I would go back just for the bread pudding.    Atmosphere/Staff:   Bo, the bartender made a mean Hurricane and had extensive knowledge of the shrimp apps that proved to be very helpful.  Everything about the two story restaurant was uniquely decorated and made you feel comfortable and relaxed.  The upstairs outdoor patio was quaint and cozy with a classy touch.  Overall, simply wonderful.    Please give it a try.. You wont regret it.     Enjoy  -Ian M.",

We never waited for drink refills; the staff was always on top of it, even though the place was packed. Fried Green tomatoes for an appetizer was perfect! We split the Chicken Diane - delicious! Bourbon pecan pie for dessert. Great dinner, great music, atmosphere was on point. We did sit in the same room as the band (which we requested) so it was a little loud to be having conversation but we enjoyed the music very much. Definitely recommend and will be back!",

At least in the top 5.   Earlier Review: Fantastic and flavorful crawfish etouffee-  I like mine spicier than normal but it's just perfect.  Wonderfully satisfying.  A top meal to remember.   Have been going to Cajun Queen off and on for 20 years, so it's about time for this review. Highest recommendation. Other dishes sampled and liked were the Shrimp Diane and a basic fried shrimp.   Decent desserts too. Had the warm bourbon pecan pie (tasty but not much bourbon in it).",

Clear example of how to take a great restaurant with great food with large (even too large) servings and add it with a server who could care less, and you get a rotten time. Front of the house is a mess while the back of the house purrs. Do not ever, ever sit in the back right room with tile floors - it will leave you deaf. We quickly ate and ask for the deserts to go. Ownership needs to solve this problem because frankly, it's not worth it to go there, great food or not.",

I elected to order off the special Restaurant Week menu that was a great deal for $30: wine, shrimp gumbo, blackened Mahi Mahi with crawfish & sun dried tomatoes, and key lime pie. The Mahi Mahi was huge and out of this world good. My wife ordered off the menus & went for the dinner salad, 8 oz filet mignon & veggies. Her steak was superb.

Of course we didn't have reservations, but luckily were able to sit right away after grabbing two stools in their bar area upstairs. It turned out to be a great little spot overlooking the valet area so there were plenty of people watching opportunities :)  I got the 4 course pre fixe - glass of chardonnay, cup of gumbo, crawfish etouffee, and bread pudding - for $30. For the quantity and quality of food, I was impressed. The only thing I didn't like of my meal was the chardonnay - but I almost consider that a freebie since most restaurant week menus don't include alcohol.   I really liked that both the gumbo and etouffee were spicy and flavorful, but not drowning in salt. I love cajun food, and really appreciated that Cajun Queen could satisfy the Bayou flavor and seasonings without being overly buttery or overly salty (think Zatarain's).  While we were there, a live jazz band was playing downstairs. Great spot for date night.",

The space between tables and the table tops are small and the noise level is load. I suggest a reservation if you don't want to wait along time to be seated.  It's quaint.  Food: 4 stars  The four of us had three rounds of Shrimp and grits and one dish of the vegetarian plate (not on the menu, special request).  We all agreed, the grits had a very good taste with the cheese and creole sauce but they were a little runny this time around.  We all enjoyed the andouille sausages, but the blackened grilled shrimp had a taste to it that we couldn't make out, and didn't enjoy.  I ate 3 of 8 and left the rest, same for my wife.  Our guest ate his but kept making a comment that he couldn't identify the odd taste.   Service: 5 stars  Our waiter was friendly but distant, apologized if he had to interrupt our conversation and was quick to keep our drinks filled.  Plates were quickly cleared and food came to us hot.    Extras: Valet parking is free, but bring a few bucks tip.",

I went with a friend and we split the fried oyster appetizer, suggested by our waiter and I got the shrimp diane, also a recommendation of our waiter. We ate upstairs and the bar area wasn't too busy since we went during a week night so we had very good and attentive service. Everything I ordered which I finished off with bread pudding dessert was extremely tasty, so much that I am still thinking about it today which is why I am leaving this review! I have already recommended this place to others and can't wait to go back.  The Groupon deal they run for $25 worth of $40 makes it a great deal too.  However, I don't need a Groupon to go back!",

The biggest complaint I had is that my food was not hot. I ordered the Cajun pasta dish and it came out lukewarm AND it wasn't very flavorful. My husband enjoyed his shrimp and grits.

Since I live within walking distance, I've had the pleasure of coming to Cajun Queen countless times. Sometimes I stray and try a new dish, but overall I usually go for the usual - bowl of seafood gumbo and a side of crawfish etouffee which is more than enough to fill me up. Their fried oysters are divine; perfectly juicy with light crunchy breading. If you go in the evenings, you'll be serenaded by the cutest old men band that croon most big band type hits.

The wine (cabernet) was decent enough. For the appetizer we ordered the gumbo and the caesar salad. I can't rate the gumbo because I'm not a fan of what's in it. I was told it was good though. The salad was just a salad nothing great. For the main course we ordered the chicken etouffee and the cajun chicken pasta. The chicken in the etouffe was the same texture and taste as you'd get from takeout chinese food which my boyfriend said that's why he liked it. The sauce was okay but it didn't save the dish. The cajun chicken pasta was ehhh. It was eatable but again I'd never go back for it. Dessert consisted of bread pudding and key lime pie. The boyfriend liked his bread pudding but I wasn't a fan and my key lime pie was good but I would swear it was Sarah Lee!! I feel no need to ever come back to Cajun Queen, the food just wasn't great and really a spice let down considering it's supposed to be cajun and it's not a very comfortable restaurant.",

Oh we also had the Peach Aloha and Hurricane to drink. Everything was great! We cleaned all of our plates and enjoyed the atmosphere. The set up was nice, albeit a tad cramped upstairs. At times it was a little hard to talk amongst ourselves with the band playing, but this was not a deal breaker because the band took plenty of breaks so that everyone could eat, talk, and relax in peace. I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I usually LOVE Cajun Queen's food. It's been one of my favorite places to eat in the Queen City, but not this particular time. I'm not sure if all the groupons have made them cut back on providing quality food, or if there's someone new in the kitchen, but everything was off. The steak which usually melts in your mouth, was very tough and quite fatty for a ribeye. It was hard to dig through it for an edible piece. The broccoli on both of the dishes my boyfriend and I ordered was very tough as well. In a failed attempt to course out our meal, our waitress left us feeling like an afterthought when we couldn't find her for simple things like refilled glasses or clean silverware. The only plus to our experience was the hostess staff at the door. They were very inviting & seated us quickly right where we would be most comfortable. I really appreciated the extra effort to give us an option. But overall, despite the awesome deal, I doubt I will be back to Cajun Queen any time soon.",

Maybe it's because people have never had real Cajun cuisine before.  The fried green tomatoes were blah.  The batter wasn't tasty at all.  My entree was the combo etouffee with shrimp, chicken and crawfish.  The seasoning was weak.  I must say that the shrimp and chicken were cooked really well.  I just didn't expect a whole chicken breast to be laid over my plate.  The portions were good.  Neither one of my two friends finished their plates.  One said her shrimp and grits were just okay.  My other friend said her fried oysters were fresh.  I will not be going back.  Parking was hard to find and it was loud inside.",

Portion sizes are generous and it is hard not to fill up on the main dishes. Dessert, especially the bread pudding is worth saving room for.  The service has always been friendly, although it can be a little slow at time. This is not a place for a quick bite to eat and more of a restaurant for a leisurely 2-3 hour dinner.  Noise levels can get a little high depending on where you are seated.   Overall highly recommended.",

They were good but the only options to come with it was mashed potatoes and coleslaw and broccoli.   The very bland potatoes were cold, the slaw my husband got was not good, & the broccoli was just a giant tree on the plate.   The side house salad we ordered for an additional $4 was awful.   There were romaine core in the salad and one slice of cucumber.  The leaves were so huge that it looked like it was just thrown on the plate without thought.  The waiter was loud and annoying and our drinks ran out several times.   Having to ask someone to refill drinks.....the \"complimentary\" valet was not something I want forced on us either but we had no choice.  When it was time to retrieve our car, it was raining and we had to get it ourselves because the drivers were too busy parking other cars to get ours.  Do not go here if you want good food and a nice evening.",

Having said that, what I do know is the difference between Bad food, So-so food, and Good food.. and the food at Cajun Queen is definitely in the Good food category. I was there over the weekend, and got to try the BBQ shrimp, seafood gumbo (appetizers) and the etouffee (entree). Yes, we got a little greedy and tried the etouffee not just with chicken or shrimp or crawfish, but with all three! Every dish was so full of flavor and spice - not the 'my mouth is on fire' kinda spice, but the kind that is enjoyable and goes perfectly with their sweet fruit punch rum cocktail - the hurricane. I could taste the heat in the food, and the basic, yet strong flavors of salt and black pepper, paprika,  herbs and onions, and if that's what Cajun/Creole food is supposed to taste like, I need to get down to New Orleans and indulge in some more of this amazing food! In addition to the food, the service was great and quick. The restaurant was packed, but we never found ourselves sitting around looking for our waiter. He was also kind enough to replace my cocktail when I wasn't pleased with my initial choice (I ordered a Cajun martini, and now I know that that's obviously not the kind of drink you want with spicy food :) )",

Towards the end of our meal, I noticed one of the valet guys move my car out of the parking lot right next to the restaurant, and around 5 or so minutes later, return it back to the same spot in the same parking lot. After asking the valet why that would happen, I was told it was to move another car out of the way. When asked why the car would be driven around the block just to move it out of the way, he didn't have a good answer, especially when my car (a sports car), was the only one that was \"strategically\" moved.  After bringing my concerns to the restaurant manager, I was essentially told that he would have to trust that they had a good reason for moving my car. Needless to say, his answer and lack of action was very disappointing. I would expect the manager to take such matters much more seriously and at the least investigate the issue...  So if you're thinking of going here, enjoy the food but be careful with letting the valet park your car.",

    "text": "We arrived at 7pm on Friday  for our reservation and was seated immediately.  We were seated upstairs where the jazz band plays.  The music was good but was extremely loud because it's a small area.  It was very hard to have a conversation with my husband without yelling and/or repeating myself.  The food was good not great.  The Cajun Popcorn was a good appetizer, but next time I would ask for the sauce on the side (some pieces were drenched).  We both had the blackened catfish with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli.  I added the extra topping of Diane sauce.  The catfish had very good flavor and we received two nice sized pieces.  We each only had 2-3 small pieces of broccoli with thick stalks and they could have been steamed maybe a minute or two longer.    I had read previous reviews about parking, so we used the valet service.  When it was time to leave, the attendants seemed overwhelmed.  After waiting about 5 minutes, we decided to get our own car....the attendant just handed us the keys, no apologies or anything.  When we got to the car, the drivers side window was down.  Luckily, it was a very light drizzle of rain that evening and nothing valuable was in the car!   Overall,  very festive atmosphere, food was good, and wait service was good.  We were never without water or tea. It got extremely crowded  around 7:45 so we recommend reservations.  The Valet Service was disappointing.  The guys need to be trained on basic customer service.  Get a Groupon if possible.",

Unfortunately, my experience was not the best. The waiter was attentive and my glass of water was never empty. I got the BBQ shrimp as an appetizer and it was fantastic. Full of flavor! However, my entree was bland! I got the Shrimp Diane and I had such high hopes that fell flat. If it wasn't for the Groupon, I would've been upset to have paid full price. Not sure if I will return.",

My meal was one of those 'slap yo Mama and Grandma good! So that once they realize you've got them you force them to take a bite. Maybe it was just my meal - I probably wouldn't try this in real life, as it wouldn't end well. Leftovers wouldn't save the day either    Digressing, I met a sweet couple who have become family friends. I witnessed a couple get engaged.

I would recommend getting the groupon or living social deal ($20 for $40).   Service: Can be slow to nonexistent at times. I almost always find myself searching for the wait staff. This is especially True if you're seated upstairs. Takes forever to get your check.   Ambiance: The restaurant is in an old 2 story house. Tables are really tight. The \"booths\" are even tighter.  Lots of nice photography from Nola on the walls. A huge porch style dining area off the back. Live band upstairs. About upstairs....seating is sardines in a can. The tables are almost touching along the window. Upstairs is usually very loud. I'm sitting here listening to a woman scream over the music about how many times a day she pumps to feed her baby.  Along with a guy making jokes about his penis....sigh! The bar is also upstairs  FYI.   Food: Great food. It makes up for the loud people and so so service.  My go to is the diane, a mushroom based dish with either chicken, shrimp, crawfish or all three.  Because I'm difficult I get it with blackened chicken and crawfish over mashed potatoes rather than white rice. My other faves are the fried catfish and the bbq shrimp. Too dang good! They also makea decent hurricane.  I've heard Sunday brunch is good, haven't been yet though.  They also offer complimentary valet on the side street next to the restaurant.",

    "text": "So I have been putting Cajun Queen off for sometime now but after I kept hearing online others raving about how good the food was I said eh lets go. So myself and others headed out here yesterday. One thing I love is their is complimentary parking here we were panicking when we first arrived thinking we were not going to be able to find a park ,but to our surprise they had valet service. I feel Cajun Queen has a very intimate setting. Also if you looked around that's all we really seen was couples sitting around gazing in each others eyes and such. They did a very good job with bringing that New Orleans Vibes to Cajun Queen far as decorating goes, real laid back setting with Jazz music playing and mardi gras beads everywhere from outside in the grass to hanging over the ceiling fans I thought that part was pretty cool. Now I can't say the same about the food. Our food was okay, I was expecting so much more I feel like what I ordered wasn't that flavor filled as it should be. I ordered the Crawfish scampi with rice, my mother ordered the half half deal half fried shrimp and half fried oysters, she complained about her broccoli being pretty tough but she didn't want to make a fuss so she just left on the plate. What I will say is for an appetizer we ordered the fried green tomatoes and those were to die for !!!!! Not sure what type of sauce those tomatoes were drenched in but I'm definitely going back just for the green fried tomatoes I want to give them another try all in all .",

    "text": "As most foodies know, a large part of the dining experience is the service.  If the food is magnificent, you can get away with slightly lesser service, but Cajun Queen wasn't tasty enough (but it was good!) to counter the experience of bad service.  The free valet is a nice touch, because parking is a beast around there.  The hostess was busy but seated us kindly.  Then the waiter showed up.  He seemed put out with us, but as the night progressed, it became clear that he might have been irritated with a loud party behind us, because he became slightly less aggravated when they left.  The second bummer of the night was where we were sitting seemed to be a hugely traveled path for people coming and going all night long.  I was bumped every few seconds all night long.  Tiresome.  Seafood Gumbo should have been blowing my doors off with flavor, but instead it was just okay.  I was a little disappointed with the mildness of it.  Needed something.  I had the Crawfish Etouffee and it was really too similar to the gumbo.  I should have made a better choice.  But, it had the same problems as the Gumbo, being too bland.  I guess I just expected more.  My friend had Chicken Diane.  It's a sauteed breast of chicken with mushrooms, green onions, Cajun spices, garlic, butter and parsley.  All served over rice.  Though it was pretty rich, it was a solid dish.  Dessert was again, fine.  There really weren't that many choices, so I chose pecan pie.  It was fine, presentation was pretty lame.  I know, what can you do with a slice of pie.  But 3 or 4 puffs of whip cream from a can has to be one of the least fancy ways to dress it.  We may try it again, perhaps we were there on an off night?  I do like to give a few chances before writing a place off, but this night was not a good showing for this landmark Charlotte restaurant.  (This review from my personal blog)",

The atmosphere is homey...literally it's in a house! Unfortunately because of that not all seats are great seats, sit too close to a window in the winter you'll regret it! Also the seats could be too close for comfort. My favorite thing here is the etouffee! It has just the right amount of Cajun spice without it being overwhelming.  Beware, parking sucks here with the potential of being towed or blocked is high! Pay attention to signs and try to find somewhere on the street.",

The first time we had a jambalaya dish that was on the menu at the time and it was not the best. It was dry and old feeling. We decided to give it a second try and and ordered fried pickles, and cajun popcorn. The pickles were good. The cajun popcorn was fried crawfish with csjun aoli sauce. It was better than the pickles and a large portion. We split the etouffee which was gokd as well but not spectacular.",

When you walk in the hostess are nice and I was greeted immediately. First level is divided by a simple walkway that leads to the kitchen. On both sides are tables that range from 2 person to 6 person seating. Decorations are very appealing and the setup draws you in and makes you comfortable. If you head up stairs as I did since I arrived prior to my reservation there is a bar. Around the bar are 4 person high top tables (3 to be exact) and there are approximately 8-10 chAirs at the bar. Directly adjacent to the bar is another seating room that has the reservation only tables. The great thing about this room is there is a live band that plays. It was very mellow and relaxing. If you want to be in the room with the live band you have to indicate that when you make your reservation.  If you sit at the high top tables you can hear the music and still be able to hold a conversation without raising your voice (I would recommend this option)   Bo, the bartender was Excellent. Bo made great recommendations, was very conversational, just a all around genuinely good person it seemed.   I ordered the platter with the catfish, scallops, fried claims and shrimp. It came with red beans and rice and gumbo.  The food was great. Had a side of fried green tomatoes, again it was great.   I noticed that the servers worked well with one another paying attention to not just when the people they were waiting on needed assistance but moved from table to table as a team.  Oh yeah there is also an outdoor seating area on the second level balcony, another subtle but nice addition to the restaurant.  Great place, wonderful service, I would go back multiple times. Well worth the prices that I consider reasonable and I'm cheap",

I got the shrimp scampi that was served with tons of shrimp (11 shrimp to be exact) and it was delicious. Nice and buttery. My boyfriend got the cajun pasta special and he loved that too.

    "text": "Let me preface my review by saying I'm a Louisiana native.   I booked a last minute reservation via yelp and thank goodness I did because they were quite busy.  The Parking situation is a bit crazy but they do have a complimentary valet! The ambiance is very casual and the restaurant is a bit overcrowded.    I ordered a cup of gumbo and the New Orleans platter. Our food came so fast... impressive! The gumbo was very bland. I don't recommend ordering it! The New Orleans platter was very big and they offer an option to split it with two people for a small up charge and slightly more food!! This was a great option. I split it with my boyfriend and we each received a huge serving of catfish, a couple shrimp, a scallop and a few oysters. I asked that the oysters be fried hard however they weren't ....so we didn't eat them. The shrimp were fine but they weren't really battered ... weird. The fried catfish was the real star of the show... no complaints. The platter also comes with a serving of red beans and rice. Traditionally red beans and rice is thick. Instead, I received a small serving of watery red beans over a lot of rice!   In total, all this was about $40 which is very reasonable. It could be that I had really high hopes but I found this place to be disappointing.    They do not split checks or accept groupons dated the same day of service. I suggest making a reservation to be safe and bring cash to tip valet.",

    "text": "Well well well. I hate to be a negative Nancy here but the food has seriously declined in every aspect since last year when it was fairly good. Once upon a time it was decent.  My group had crawfish Ettoufee, fried green tomatos, seafood gumbo, crawfish tails with sherry remoulade, barbecue shrimp.   My Ettoufee was very old. There was no attempt on presentation whatsoever as they usually did, and it was served it a different bowl. It was literally slopped over loke a pig trough. I didn't eat it.  The gumbo was very soupy, and tasted like instant tomato soup; not reminiscent of any authentic new Orleans version in any way whatsoever.  Fried green tomatoes were good. BBQ shrimp were fine.  I'm not sure, at this point, if they can ever get it together again. They're so far off the deep end now that I have officially given up. I'll never return again.   Good luck to you if you decide to book a reservation based on the positive reviews, you're going to need it.",

    "text": "In a city of chain restaurants, a million breweries,  and overall lack of creative cuisine, Cajun Queen shines. The fried oysters are the freshest I've had since I left New England, and the meal portions arelarge and satisfying (I almost always finish my meals when we go out because I'm a grown man, but I usually take home a whole extra serving from this place). In addition to the oysters, I typically order the \"all 4\" Diane, which is chicken, crawfish, shrimp, and andouille sausage. Definitely bring your appetite to this place! Service is always great, and the ambience is unique, it's inside an old two story house. The upstairs bar is always fun with live music every day (or close to it). Downstairs is great for a more traditional dining experience. Price points are in the mid-range, bill will be about 60 bucks between my girlfriend and I without drinks and about 100 with drinks, so good for a date night that won't break the bank.",

I wasn't sure what to expect since it was Easter. I don't think CQ did anything different to their menu- it was one page of items but the offerings were so compelling that we did not mind.   I had the fried green tomatoes Benedict and my boyfriend had the bourbon french toast. We also ordered the beignet. The beignets were devoured in 0.5 seconds. The jam they serve it with is absolutely incredible.   This was my first time at CQ. What stood out to me was the service. We ate around 11, so it was right when they opened on Sunday, but the servers were constantly asking us if we needed any additional coffee or anything else.   Only reason why it gets 4 stars was because of the limited options (not sure how often they change up the menu) and because they only serve plain coffee. Sometimes I like to spice it up and get a latte or cappuccino with brunch.   They did have a drink menu (including hurricanes!) for brunch but we stuck to coffee this time.   I was impressed with the quality of food and pricing. We will be back!",

My boyfriend and I celebrated my birthday last night and the staff of Cajun Queen definitely made it a night to remember. We were greeted upon arrival. I wanted to enjoy the live jazz and asked if we could be seated upstairs, the hostess had no issue accommodating this request. Within minutes we were greeted by our waiter. He was so polite, sweet and attended to each of the guest with the same care. Service and music were superb.  Before leaving the band/staff and guest sang Happy Birthday.   Food: I honestly can't say enough about how good the food was. The Diane w/ all three meats (crawfish, shrimp and chicken) *dramatic pause*... is in my top 5 of incredible dishes. Honestly, the garlic butter sauce wrapped me like a warm blanket. The portion was appropriate for the price and I didn't feel slighted. My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits and really enjoyed that as well.   Drink:  I ordered the Hurricane and it was definitely worth the price. They didn't hold back on the alcohol.   Parking: Do NOT park behind the salon!! Use the valet or park across the street.",

The grits seemed to be a little runny and the portion size seemed small. Both entrees were served with a choice of gumbo or a side salad. I was impressed by the waitress's concern that my friend didn't like the shrimp and grits. She offered to provide a different dish And when the offer wasn't accepted, she removed the entree from our bill without being asked to do so,which tells me that Cajun Queen values their patrons.",

For my appetizer I had the Cajun fried oysters. For my entree I had the Creole Shrimp with rice it was spicy, which I like. There was a live jazz band playing which was nice. The only con I had was it being a little tight. It's in a house which was made into a restaurant. I dined on the 2nd floor and it was 8 of us. The waiters had us sit directly behind a table that had all the utensils and drinks. So they'd constantly have to come up behind us to grab napkins, more water or lemonade, or utensils for other tables. Other than that it was nice. Not sure if I'll go back but if I do I won't go with a large group, most likely for a date night with my hubby.",

The jazz band is actually reall good but if you are going here for a good conversation then you might as well let them know upfront that you would prefer sitting downstairs. Personally our group liked the live music. Prices are decent and food is as well. The service was a bit slow mainly coz the place was packed!!  I ordered the Spicy chicken etouffe which was awesome. I ordered it extra spicy and man they meant it. My hubby however said that his blackened catfish was \"eh\". Still this is a good place to chill out with friends on a Friday night.",

The Duck special is also great...well prepared and very flavorful.   The environment is somewhat noisy at times and with the tight spacing can be a distraction.

We wanted something different, and that's exactly what we got at Cajun Queen.  We were seated quickly, and offered the choice between inside, inside upstairs where the live jazz was playing, or outside. (We went with outside, why not?)  Our waiter was attentive without being over bearing, and our drinks refilled without having to ask. He explained not only the specials but the \"house favorites\" as well.  We both chose something off the regular menu, wanting to see standards rather than one offs for our 1st visit, and we were not disappointed at all! We both enjoyed food that had flavor, and character, and didn't taste like everything else. I suppose coming from NY, we we're a bit spoiled by the variety and quantity of food choices, and it was nice to see with a little bit of poking around, it can still be found in our new home.  The food and the service were wonderful, and the prices were very reasonable for the amount and quality of the food we received. This is definitely a place we will return to, and will recommend to others.",

    "text": "VERY rarely do my boyfriend and I leave dinner completely satisfied, elated and already planning our next trip. Well, Cajun Queen happened to be one of those meals.  Neither of us eat cajun/creole very often so we were a little hesitant at first. After holding on to a Groupon for a few weeks we finally made the trip...what on earth took us so long?!  One step through the doors and you're immediately transported to a raucous, lively setting reminiscent of 1980's New Orleans. Tables are tightly packed; patrons share drinks and laughs; and sounds of jazz echo from upstairs. The walls are adorned by \"Nawlins\" inspired artwork and an appropriate purple, gold and green palette is interwoven throughout the house.  The Gumbo was the only thing that I wasn't completely impressed with. It had good flavor and an ample helping of shrimp but I felt it was missing something. The consistency was thinner and more watered down than I anticipated. Keep in mind I am no cajun aficionado.  The boyfriend ordered the pasta special: Two blackened chicken breasts over a heaping portion of tortellini in a spicy pesto cream sauce with peppers, Andouille sausage, peppers, and artichokes. WOWEE MAMA. This was one of the most delicious meals (yes, it wasn't even my meal) that I've had in a while.  My etouffee was delicious as well, thought admittedly, not quite as impressive as the pasta dish. It did kick some heat but it was good flavorful spice heat. Large portions seemed to be the theme of night and despite force-feeding ourselves to the point of pain, we both managed to leave with decent-sized leftovers.  From the camaraderie and excellent service to the food and drinks...everything seemed to be perfect and I cannot wait to return!",

We all felt a bit pushed.   Being a big fan of the Crawfish Etouffee my choice was easily made. We each ordered a different entree and seemed pleased with our choices. Did I mention the service was swift? We could have finished our meal in an hour flat. Our server assumed, correctly, that we were ordering from the special menu and removed the regular menu because \"you won't be needing these\". If you want return Customers you may want to allow sufficient time to peruse the regular menu to see what other choices are available.   Food was good, as always, but wouldn't recommend visiting during this promo week. My usual rating is 4 's but not this visit.  Sorry got to run.............",

We arrived about 940pm Saturday night....it was a bit crowded, noisy and somewhat of an unfriendly environment.  Once greeted by the host,  she proceeded to take us to a crowded room with children and loud conversations.  We asked to move to the other side of the restaurant,  but she stated the server wasn't taken anymore tables. (hence they were closing soon).....once seated in the upstairs sectio. We were quiet happy with our table sevtion ...our server Taylor was superb gave great recommendations and was honest about the menu items.....  The food was not as  good as expected ....I ordered the crawfish  etouffe half order. It had no taste as though they scrapped the bottom of the barrel with a somewhat burnt taste......my friend ordered the fried oysters for an appetizer which she said was extremely good.  She also order a signature cocktail which I tasted and agree it was strong and good......I would give this restaurant  another try and however; I would definitely arrive before  closing hiurs....great location and nice abeyance",

    "text": "Can you believe it took me 20 years of living in Charlotte before I tried the Cajun Queen?  I guess i have preconceived notions as to what Cajun food is like crawfish, beans, rice which are typically things I don't go for.  Yeah, I was wrong.  Not everything has all that including what I had last night.  The Blackend pork tenderloin was truly amazing.  Just the right level of spice and it was served with crispy fried plantains.  I'm still trying to figure out what the covering on the plantains were.  Also served with a black been puree which was tasty.  The side salad had a spicy vinagrette.  The only disappointment with the salad is that the carrot strips looked like they were right out of the bag you get at Harris Teeter.  Another flaw is that this dinner was with the dinner group.  I called a week in advance to reserve space for 12.  When we got there, they weren't ready for us.  We waited for a tables to be pushed together after being told the patio was full by one person when there was only one table in use.  After waiting a short time at the bar, we asked another person if we could sit outside and she said that would be easier on her.  So why couldn't we go out there to begin with.    Oh well.  That's my only complaint.  Otherwise, the service was spot on.  Water and other drinks were refilled promptly and plates were taken away quickly.  Yes, this is a place I must come back to.    Word of warning...parking is a bear here.  It might be easier parking across the street.",

The ambiance of this restaurant reminds me of the charm of the French Quarter.  A live jazz band plays during the week and adds that perfect touch to a wonderful dining experience. I always say I'm going to try something different, but I usually order \"Three Way Diane\": chicken breast, shrimp and crawfish sauteed with mushrooms, garlic, green, onions, and parsley served over a bed of rice. This dish has a hint of spice to complement the dish. The portion is perfect and depending on my mood, I have some to bring home or I eat every morsel.  Other visits to CQ, I've ordered the BBQ shrimp, shrimp etouffee and the fish of the day. I've just never written a review. The gumbo is good, but on my last visit I felt that it was missing something...just couldn't put my taste buds on it.",

My 3 way etoufee had the heat but lacked flavor as did my New Orleans BBQ shrimp appetizer which looked considerably small for the large portion I ordered. My cajun martini was a bad choice as it was not chilled enough and too hot to enjoy. I'll chalk that up as my fault for trying something different. I think I'll wait awhile before returning here.",

Service was friendly and efficient (started a tiny bit rough but corrected quickly)   It was Fathers Day but the place was empty. I'm worried! Hope it was just a slow night for them.

Etouffee was bland as well as the pasta special. I swear they must have ran out of salt and spice. It was just embarrassing to New Orleans.

    "text": "Took my hubby (whose parents and grandparents all grew up in Mississippi, super close to Louisiana) to the Cajun Queen for some cajun food!   We entered into the foyer (lobby) and were greeted by two cheerful hostesses. They told us it would be about 15 minutes for a table and steered us upstairs to the bar while we waited for our table. We ordered two drinks and were quickly called for our table. We were seated in the small dining room to the right of the foyer. The rooms are all full of dark furniture, paintings, and dark wood. There were many people seated on the downstairs patio, and it looked to have been cooler than the small (packed) dining room. However, the cocktails we ordered when we were seated at our table quickly cooled us off.   We started our dinner with the fried green tomato appetizer. The tomatoes were artfully displayed with a creamy sauce. The sauce, in combination with the tomatoes, was fabulous! Both dinners came with our choice of gumbo or salad. The waiter highly suggested the gumbo, and it was really good. For entrees we ordered cajun shrimp and grits and crawfish etouffee. Both dinners were full of flavor and were large in size.   The upstairs dining room, adjacent to the bar, features live jazz music 7 nights a week. Definitely worth a listen while seated at the bar, or eating in that dining room.   Be sure and pick up some mardi gras beads in the front foyer, and have a sit on the front porch while you let your delicious dinner settle. Grab a photo with the giant queen gator in the front yard as a souvenir!",

Please eat here. Do I sound like I'm begging? Because i am. I want someone to taste these shrimp and grits! I also had the popcorn crawfish as an appetizer and though i wish it was a little warmer, it was cool enough that i could immediately start tasting the goodness that was laying in front of me. The waiters seemed to have a strange energy, but I didn't care because the food was so good. Must Go!!",

    "text": "Elizabeth is one of my favorite parts of town; I love how old houses have been remade into restaurants and offices.  Too often charming old buildings are paved over and replaces with concrete boxes.  The Cajun Queen is in one of these old homes, and this lends it a very intimate and warm atmosphere.  Of course, atmosphere isn't everything when it comes to restaurants, but the food at the Cajun Queen was fortunately spot-on as well.  Our tables started with the fried oyster appetizer, and it was a hit: emarkably light for a fried dish, it was like eating little oyster clouds.  For my main course, I ordered etouffee with all three (chicken, shrimp, and crawfish).  It was creamy and deeply, darkly spicy.  I was a little worried about the protein aspect, since those three items have different cooking times, but all were perfectly done.  The Cajun Queen provided us with a delicious dinner.  I knock a single star off only because the service, while not bad, wasn't great either.  The place isn't exactly cheap, so our waiter earned a nice tip.  He could've paid just slightly more attention to our table.  Oh well, everyone has an off day.",

Love the intimate atmosphere, love the jazz band upstairs... and the hubster loves the 7th Street Stumbler (have you ever seen a 6'4, 300lb man stumble? It's not pretty).  FGT's are to DIE for.  I'm a northerner, so I don't really have a ton of iterations to compare them to, but they are pretty damn good.  Crawfish. Etoufee. 'Nuff said.  So flavorful and delicious.  This is one of our top 10 restaurants in the QC.  Worth a visit, fo sho!",

    "text": "This was my first time trying this particular restaurant.  I've visited New Orleans quite a few times, and was excited to get the opportunity to go there.  The atmosphere had a very intimate setting. However, I was looking forward to their catfish.  When the waiter stated that they ran out 10 minutes before we got there, we had to pay for an uncharge for a better fish.  Didn't quite understand that, since they were the ones that ran out of the catfish.  I'll go back there, but not anytime soon.",
