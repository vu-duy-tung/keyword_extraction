Our experience was terrible from the moment we first walked in. We asked for half sweet tea and half lemonade. The waiter left and never came back. We stopped another waiter and told him our waiter forgot about us. He apologized and went to find our waiter. Our waiter finally came back with the wrong drinks! Even after telling him three more times I wanted half tea, half lemonade he still brought out the wrong drink each of the three times!! When our food finally arrived, it was also wrong! I requested for the bbq chicken to be EXTRA well done and it was brought to our table half cooked and nearly RAW!!! The manager came over with a nasty attitude. She didn't even bother to apologize!!! I think I'll just stick with going to the Ballantyne location until the uptown location hire better cooks, better waiters and a better manager.",

    "text": "I WILL NEVER visit this establishment again. This was probably one of the worst dining experiences that I have been apart of. I went to this establishment last night (Feb. 14) with a few friends. While our waiter was very attentive in the initial request of our orders, the experience started to go downhill when it took our food 45 minutes to reach our table and without being updated on the status of our food. When I was given my food, I instantly saw that my order was incorrect. After alerting my waitress that my order was incorrect she did acknowledge and stated she would make the proper adjustments. After waiting for about another 30 minutes my food was brought out again incorrect and COLD! We had to alert our waitress again who in turn said that she would get the manager because the kitchen was having problems comprehending what she wrote down for the order. 15 minutes later the manager finally made it over where he explained that he was having problems with staffing in the kitchen but would take care of my food and apologized. Another 30 minutes passed after we have paid our tabs and I was just getting my food without fries and was told that it would be an additional six minutes for fries. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. I understand that things do happen but for them to happen wrong three times is very unacceptable!!! This review makes me give 1 star but it would not receive ANY if that's was an option!",

Their bartenders are utterly lethargic and are incapable of eye contact.  They want to stand at the left side of the bar and chat with each other while customers sit without Ketchup, butter, silverware etc.     The cooking staff does not know the difference between grilled chicken and blackened chicken, they just grill it regardless.    Also beware when you choose your side dishes because they do not list their prices for each item.  Some sides are $3 and some are 99 cents, so if you want two sides with your meal make sure you choose the $3 side as your \"free\" (included) side and the 99 cent side as your \"paid\" side.

There are so many breweries in Charlotte, but Duckworth's is really no slouch when it comes to beer selection and quality.    If you have been to the other Duckworth's on Park Rd., then you may like this one better.  There is way more space, so you don't have to stand awkwardly in a cramped space while people whack you with the door on the way in.  Oh...and you may want to bring sunscreen, because the radiation from the 10,000 TVs may bake you while you eat.",

The amount of beers on draft is impressive and overwhelming but the bartenders were more then willing to offer some help and recommendations.  The Mommoo's wings were awesome and you could definitely taste the vinegar base they're coated with. The Jalapeno chicken dinner was equally delicious and their coleslaw was very good.  A little pricey for one person but you are in the city. Would go back the next time I'm in Charlotte based on the beer selection alone.",

My friend ordered the tacos & the tortilla chips, I tried some of it, LUV the salsa it tasted really fresh not like the can stuff but lorrrd the tortilla chips were soooo salty like salt was literally falling off the chips lol!

So comfortable and the food was DELICIOUS.  The filet mignon was the most tender we'd ever had.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu. She was very friendly and professional.

    "text": "I have been to Duckworth's before, but after this experience I am not sure I will ever come back.   The reason it gets two stars instead of one is that the Beer menu is awesome.  That is about all it has going for it.  We came on a Saturday night to watch a game, and after the 3:30 games were over it took about 30 minutes for them to change the sound over from the Channel Nine News to the Backstreet Boys, which was an improvement from the news but a game, any game would have been appreciated especially since we had requested TV's to be turned to the games (Which in itself took asking two different people and about 20 minutes).   If they were busy perhaps we would have been more understanding, but we were one of three tables upstairs, there was no big crowd.   The food was also subpar. I  ordered a Buffalo Chicken Wrap that had no Buffalo Sauce on it.  I clarified with the waiter that I had the correct food, and he said I did, and that it came with a barbecue ranch sauce to dip in. (The sauce looked all barbecue)   If indeed I did get the correct wrap (Still not sure I did) I would definitely avoid it if you are a fan of Buffalo Sauce, as there was little to none on it.  Since I was hungry and felt like I already annoyed the waiter enough I ate the chicken wrap, which was all it was and it was okay.   We ended up leaving at halftime to go somewhere else due to the slow service (Again, not really understood because it was not a busy night for them) and so-so food.",

When we were given the drink list, it was on an iPad and all 60 drinks ran together on the list. It was overwhelming trying to find something new on an iPad. We ordered an app of fried pickles. I will give them a 2 out of 5. I may just have higher standards for fried pickles but for me they were way too salty and didn't look very appetizing when it came out. I ordered a philly cheese for my meal and it tasted like it was heated up from a package. 2/5 for the Philly. My wife got the ribs and they seemed the same. They had a funky texture and tasted as though it came out of the same microwave. She ate half of the rack and didn't want to even think about taking the rest home. It was disappointing because I was really looking forward to going to this location since we had been to the one on Montford and we had a good experience.",

It really gives you the opportunity to try a beer you may never have had the chance or knew existed. With such a vast selection I am curious as to how often they rotate their list.",

When we asked the server if they carried Steigl Grapefruit Radler even though it wasn't on the menu, we were told yes. So after 20 minutes this guy sits down an almost clear beer, the beer we ordered is an orange-ish yellow and I immediately tell the server, \"That's not it. Are you sure this is Steigl?\" He says yes and dismisses us. Not at all the same beer, completely totally different. When we did get our checks it was confirmed as some type of other grapefruit beer they serve, but not what we ordered. Didn't appreciate that. Apparently there was one bartender and the bar was backed up, but it would have been nice to know before we ordered instead of sitting around wondering what's taking so long, then receiving the wrong beer. If you don't carry something when specifically asked, maybe don't just say yes and try to pass it off as a totally different beer. Whenever we mentioned our dissatisfaction with the crazy wait time or receiving the wrong order, staff was pretty blase and unsympathetic. And yes we did speak to who I assume was a manager. We almost missed our concert because of this place. Food was subpar, not sure if it was a fluke based on the reviews here but we for sure won't be returning. Huge pass. Just don't bother. Read lots of reviews to find the right \"pre concert dinner\" but this was a major regret especially with the staffs attitudes. They didn't even try to make it right.",

    "text": "We went to Charlotte this past summer for a lacrosse tournament.  We stayed in downtown Charlotte and took a shuttle from the hotel to Duckworth's.   Let me first start with my GREAT experience with Duckworth's.  My husband, my two children, and I wanted to try something new so we chose this place because it was on the hotel shuttle list and recommended by our shuttle driver.  It was a Friday night and busy.  Our server was amazing!  He took the time to go over the menu with us, he shared his recommendations for beer, and went above and beyond as far as service goes.  The food was also amazing!  The service was so good, my husband spoke to the manager and made sure that he was aware of the exceptional service we received.  Somewhere between the restaurant and the shuttle ride home, my husband lost his wallet.  We called the restaurant and they did not find it.  They did however go out of their way to help us.  They even called us the next day to see if we had located it and told us that they would call us if they found it.  We were upset that the wallet was lost, but Duckworth's did all they could do to help.  The not so good-We loved the experience from Friday night so much we went there again the next night with a group of parents and players for the lacrosse team.  We called ahead and they seated our group of 20 upstairs.  We were assigned two servers.  We knew that our group was large and we know that can put a strain on a restaurant.  We go out as a group quite often so we usually try to help the servers as much as possible.  With a group of teenage lacrosse players the boys normally do not sit with their parents when ordering.  They want to sit and hang out with their friends.  Typically when ordering at other locations the parents either order the food for their children and just pass it to them when it arrives or each person orders using their jersey number.  We suggested this to the servers and they said they would rather the parents just order for their child.  We got about half way though ordering and realized that some of the boys had given the other server their order and they other boys did not order.  We realized this was confusing and wanted to make sure all of the kids got food. Instead of trying to remedy the situation with us the servers started arguing with each other.  It was so unprofessional.  Then one server was fired during our time there and replaced with a wonderful server that tried to make everything right for us.  Then the food came out and as expected after how the first servers were acting, many of the orders were wrong.  Three people did not receive food at all.  In the end, our table's total bill was significantly discounted and everyone got something to eat.  The manager was apologetic, but seemed more annoyed that we brought a large group in and he had to discount so much of our food.  My family was embarrassed because we had praised the restaurant so much from our experience the day before.    We don't live in Charlotte and don't visit often. I am on the fence about visiting Duckworth's next time we are in town.",

By the time I had drank less than 1/10th of my brew I had been asked 4 times if I was ready to order. No...I want to drink my beer...  I like to drink a few beers and then order so I can enjoy the extensive craft beer selection they have.  But each time I come here I'm rushed to get my drink, order, and get out.  Granted, the 1st time I came here it was busy, but this time half the bar was open.  So, that means they just want me to eat and leave.    A shame , I love the Duckworth's on Park Road. Never feel that rushed.  I mainly come for the craft beer and having to down the brew without the opportunity to enjoy makes this location little more than a McDonald's in my humble opinion.  ~5 for craft beer selection ~5 for food and location ~1 for Stress factor and \"Service\"  ~2 overall for total lack of enjoyment. Yay Duckworth's  P.S. the beer they delivered was obviously the wrong brew.  We ordered a Double IPA and it was clearly a Belgian.  When we asked the Bartender to verify he shrugged and said that's what came out of the tap...laughable. Only reason I came was for brew and I can't even trust what I get when  I order here.",

    "text": "We stopped in here as we were exploring uptown, as it looked like a place we could all agree on. I will say their menu has quite the variety of choices, and most importantly their beer list is to die for. Which really is the main thing that sold us to stop by. We loved all of the beers recommended to us, it was neat you could even take a growler home if you found something you really liked! For us we were traveling so that was not an option but if I lived there I would totally join the beer club! I heard several other tables asking for the Steak Salad...I was very intrigued by this but saw it wasn't on the menu and quickly learned the menu was scaled back due to a basketball tournament in town. We still enjoyed our loaded plate of nachos and wings but I would have loved to try some of their other staples that others raved about. Luckily it wasn't packed when we were here so service was quick and friendly! Highly recommend it if you are looking for a tasty cold brew!",

We stopped in real quick because we were on the trolley pub, and one of my friends did not finish her beer yet and was running to the restroom before we had to leave. The server grabbed the beer out of her hand and slammed it on the table telling her she wasn't allowed alcohol in the bathroom..understandable. My friend was in shock that someone would actually do that and let it go. While waiting for another friend to finish in the bathroom, the server walked over to us to tell us she was not losing her job, and went so far as to swear at us (no one was even saying a word back to her). By this point no one even had alcohol in their hand and we were already on our way out the door. The rest of the staff was very friendly, but after the way she treated us, we will not be returning.",

Started good, server was attentive, but I got there early for lunch and the place was empty. Food was on par as always. By the time I was done with my food and considering dessert the place had picked up and it was impossible to my server's attention. I finally gave up and got up to go talk to her in order to pay my bill so that I could get back to work. If I give the uptown location another chance, I may amend my review, but as it stands I am very displeased with their level of service. What is the point of bringing the bill right after the food if you're not going to check on the customer from then on?  Also, a server leaning over to take your order reeking of cigarette smoke is annoying.",

The poor food runner took care of us and made sure we had app plates and silverware. This is my second time trying this location and again during a slow time period and the service was horrible. The manager walked by us twice and didn't acknowledge the fact that we didn't have silverware to eat our food he glanced at us and continued to walk past.

There are a ton of beers on tap, which are presented to you on an iPad with info on each beer to help you make the selection, and they have a beer club you can join.   As far as the food goes, the menu has a wide variety of options and everything I have tried has been perfection. Some of my favorites are their wings (I would suggest the Sweet n' Bold Gold), the steak & egg philly, and of course fries boardwalk style.

I work in the restaurant industry in Uptown and it's a True embarrassment when I see a place being ran like that.",

    "text": "This place probably deserves a five! I'd taken my little ones to the Imageon and we were looking for a no-frills dining option near by. What an awesome place! The portions are huge, lots of awesome beer on tap (over 100+)! Great menu, too! Tons of TVs, decent music and a great location! It's clean as well! There are defined sections featuring a dining area (still has lots of TVs,) a taproom and some other sections I didn't venture into. The caprese salad was better than what I expected. The balsamic vinegarette was a nice touch. The kids had the hotdog, which they loved (I enjoyed a bite or two as well.)  The brisket tacos were very flavorful and more filling than you'd think. Their best item had to be the wings. I decided to partake in the lemon pepper, which were plump, crisp and very flavorful. My favorite thing was the Bold and Gold wings. They use a South Carolina specialty, a mustard-based BBQ sauce that makes everything better! If eat it on ice cream if it were on the menu! The bold, tangy flavor makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Who doesn't love Carolina sauce? Maybe Al Quaeda or the Communists. Of course any hope of a healthy eating day was dashed so we had to order dessert. The cupcake sampler was a big hit with the family. I had to get the strawberry shortcake cheesecake. Yes, it is a real thing and yes it is even better than you thought possible!  In short, if you want a stellar meal, eat here. They have five locations in the Charlotte area. Unfortunately not yet in SC. If you want lame bland food, hit the chain across the street!",

You click on a beer and it brings up a fuller description of that particular beer. Some of the beers have a grade from the \"Beer Advocate\", which I assume is a real thing that rates beer.  So when I am looking for a beer, I am interested in a beer with a rating of A+ or A or A-. I don't want a B- beer. Here is my suggestion; put a sort function on the tablet that sorts according to the beer's rating.   After 5 minutes of playing hide and go seek with ratings on the menu, I'm not loving the experience. The people I'm with aren't fascinated by watching me try to poke out a decent beer choice.  Make it easy for the customer and you'll sell more beer.",

As a side note, the place was barely a quarter full at this time so there should be no excuse for slow service. The first issue we encountered was waiting 30 minutes, yes you read that right, for our beers. Our waiter quickly brought them to the table after complaining as to where they were. Besides the incredibly slow service, which seems to have reputation around that establishment, the worst part of the night was encountering Alyssa, the store manager. She was by far the rudest manager I've ever \"met\". Besides comping one of our dinners they messed up, which still took an hour to serve, she had the audacity to raise her tone of voice and talk back to us when telling her about the poor service we received that night. I rarely write reviews but because the way we were treated by Alyssa and the poor service, I felt inclined to let other's know to avoid that spot. Between slow service and awful, AWFUL customer service from the staff, especially Alyssa, we will no longer eat at that establishment and would recommend others to find a better place to eat instead.",

Tried to get a table in the main restaurant area, don't bother there was a 30 min wait and the bar is first come first serve so just belly-up to the bar and make friends. The atmosphere is fun, the food is way above \"bar food\" status. Also, BEER. So much beer, so many to choose from and of course they have an awesome sampler deal where you can choose 4 beers you want to try and they bring them out on this little paddle in small glasses. Their cocktail selection was also on point. I got the Melon Ball and it is definitely an acquired taste but I LOVED it.  My burger was a little over done but the toppings were so fresh and the cheese and sauce was so good I hardly noticed after a couple bites. The Buffalo chips were amazing but I wish they put chicken on them, they would be my fav thing on the menu! Will definitely be going back soon. PS it's right across the street from Discovery Place so if y'all do the Science on the Rocks 21+ boozy night at the museum, Duckworth is a perfect stop afterwards.",

We stopped by Saturday night for dinner and drinks. Wandered over to the bar area, as we waited for our table, and were immediately approached by a server who helped us find a spot to sit, explained their beer menu, and made great recommendations. The place was packed as the Duke v Carolina game was soon to start. Our drinks never went empty; bartenders were quick to notice near empty glasses. You can tell Duckworth's has done this before. They had trainers in bright red shirts assisting staff and ensuring prompt service.   After a drink at the bar, the pager buzzed and we were escorted to a table upstairs. Much quieter and mellow. Our bar tab was effortlessly transferred to our table. The service upstairs reflected what we had experienced downstairs in the bar. The food was great and came out in about 15 minutes. Most of us had a variety of their cheesesteak and all were happy. I went with the smokehouse philly - steak, jalapeno bacon, BBQ sauce, pepper jack, topped with fried onions. Paired it with garlic fries. My mouth is watering as I type this.   The basement is opening in early April as The Cellar. According to the staff, it will be a more intimate environment with specialty beer and possibly a mixologist, paired with a more refined farm-to-table menu. Fingers crossed they are open in time for my birthday!",

The service is usually okay but I've never had great service. My biggest concern is what should also be theirs, the food. Out of the 4 or 5 times I've been for food, I have NEVER had a properly cooked meal. Grilled chicken is always way over done, dry, tough to cut, and burnt on the edges. The fajitas come out sizzling like you hope for them but unlike every Mexican restaurant that seems to make it work, Duckworth's manages to send them out already charred to the point that they taste like ashes. To keep from continuing non-stop, they over cook everything; chicken, fajitas, pizza, everything.   I'll likely return for the beer and the TVs but I'd rather eat before, after, or bring my own food.",

The Diner Burger was perfectly cooked and the fresh cut fries were so delicious. We were also greeted by the manager twice during our visit, making sure that everything is running smoothly.

We waited and they weren't accommodating at all or even apologetic at all. I work as a hostess in Charleston and am very familiar with long wait times and i always try to be as accommodating to customers and quote them the appropriate times. Especially for people out of town looking for a good meal in my city. We were in Charlotte for the p!nk concert last night and we were super excited to come to this place because they have the impossible burger. By the time we left after waiting the entire hour and more, it was too late to find another restaurant so our date night turned into eating pizza in our car before the show.

My food did come at a later time than my friend so his flatbread was semi like warm by the time my food arrive.   3) the place is clean and they do take the time to handle all that needed. I just wish Hope have more help since it's only her. I find a quite a few ppl waiting for her to check in with them.

They are truly committed to making Duckworth's the best place it can be and care about the patrons who walk through their door. I think this is incredible, as most places don't take the time to do so. I hope to be visiting Charlotte again soon so that I can give Duckworth's another shot.",

Not only are there plenty of food choices (much more than the normal sports bars you are used to) but they pride themselves on their craft beer selection and the bar's selection of spirits is very good as well. This is not only a great place to have lunch or watch a game but is also a fun place to hang out either by yourself or with a group of friends. Duckworth's has been a great addition to uptown!",

The building itself is an awesome space, and seemed to be well-trafficed with a lot of customers in the bar area. I was in the main dining area, which was empty other than my table; however, it was early for dinner and everyone seemed to be enjoying happy hour over at the bar.   Overall, the food was OK; but I didn't get anything to crazy. The chips and salsa is definitely not worth the price. For $5 you get a small plate of chips and tiny saucer of salsa. If the salsa doesn't burn your tastebuds, the price will definitely burn a hole in your wallet. The buffalo chicken wrap was actually very decent, and one of the better ones I've ever had. I would definitely order it again.   However, the apple martini summed up in one word was simply, Meh! Don't come very for the liquor, just the beer.",

I'm not a huge fan of their beer menus being alphabetical as I'd rather search by style of beers - this is not an option. Back to Uptown Ducksworth's.  Friday at 7pm - the bar is not packed and I'm being ignored by most of the staff behind the bar.  After finally settling on 10 beers for 2 flights, I'm corrected by a manager-in-training who is not knowledgable about his drink menu but does correct me on the flights are 4 not 5 each.  It took a while to get them and he didn't announce nor offer which was what  beer (I had an idea but I was glad to have another bartender write everything down to confirm).  The guy who served us couldn't make recommendations other than he likes IPAs...  I didn't need the help as I'm a big beer drinker and know my way around a tap, but it could've helped his tip if he engaged us in conversation - There's 151 beers to choose from, surely he should know more than one type!! Bathrooms were not as clean as I'd assume a brand spanking new bar/restaurant should be and as early in the evening as it was.  And I can promise they would run out of all supplies halfway through the evening due to the minimal amount that was stocked in the ladies room.   I didn't eat at this visit.  Overall, it was ok.  I might go back if someone drags me, but I'd rather go to the other two locations (Faith in South Charlotte is an AMAZING server!) There's a bajillion TVs!  If you want a mediocre domestic brew and 5 different sports playing at once with meh service - you should go here.",

Came in and was never greeted so I went to the bar area, but it was too crowded so I went back to the front and the host just looked at me and asked if I needed anything. Maybe she lacks common sense. Fast forward to the service I got, my server was nice but my food tasted like it was just reheated, brought it to managements attention and he didn't seem to care. He was kind of talking down to me in a way, made me feel very uncomfortable. Then after that whole thing I look over as I'm getting ready to leave and I see him and another female which may have been a manager, I see them looking over at me and him waving his hands around while he was obviously talking about me. On my way out I got his name from the host. His name was Cory and apparently he is an assistant manager. Well maybe he needs to find a job as a high school teacher because he shouldn't be talking to adults like that.",

I was even more excited to learn of the massive draft selection that they were going to be offering.  Unfortunately, like many newly opened locations, the service starts to eventually slip.  We actually stopped going to there for the past several months, but we were downtown for a work event last night and decided to give it another try. We sat at the bar, and waited and waited and waited. The bar area was very busy as it was just a little after six. I don't know why, but the management at that location seemed to think that two bartenders were enough to service the packed bar area plus all of the drink orders coming in from the servers.  I can't believe for a restaurant that size that no other servers or managers were able to assist at the bar.  After close to 20 minutes of not even being acknowledged or having a bartender come down to the end of the bar, we just got up and left.  The people at the bar sitting closest to us were also frustrated and sitting there with empty glasses. A couple of the guys were trying to wave the bartenders down because they were so concentrated on servicing the far end of the bar where the waitstaff was picking up beer orders for the tables instead.  Unfortunately,having one of the best draft selections in town does not make up for the lack of service. So I will turn in my beer card and move on.",

We were in Charlotte for a couple of days and wanted a good food spot near the Discovery Place, with decent prices and something our entire family would love. Duckworth's is literally across the street from the museum. The amount of beer to choose from is a little overwhelming but they give you an iPad to help, plus the staff seemed very knowledgeable about the selections. My husband likes ambers (I think) while I like stouts. WHATEVER kind of beer you like they are sure to have several to choose from. We enjoyed it so much we went back the next day to try more! And if you aren't ready to commit to an entire glass or bottle, you can get a sampler. Tell your waiter/waitress what you like and the bartender will make a sample of a few different beers for you to try. If you find something you really like you can use the iPad to email it to yourself. As for the food, like I said it is good but it's not the draw. I had a burger the first day and boneless wings the next. One thing my husband really liked was that you can have the wings (bone and boneless) finished on the grill giving them a nice char flavor. If you are going to be at the Science Museum downtown and you are kind of a beer snob (that's a good thing!) then definitely walk over to Duckworth's!  Oh, and our kids enjoyed their meals too. We went for lunch one day and an early dinner the next, both times the restaurant was very family friendly!",

The hostess was friendly and attentive when I walked in looking for a friend. We sat at the bar. The entire menu, which is on an iPad because they are fancy and environmentally friendly, is expansive. I knew I wanted only an appetizer, so I didn't bother checking out the other options. You can find it online if you're interested. I ordered the potato skins. They were typical skins with cheese and bacon. There were only 4 pieces. I expected 6.  My friend who ordered bacon cheese fries w/ jalapeno bacon and the nightly special wings that had 17 spices actually did not love the wings. I had some and thought they were pretty good. Still average. Nothing to write home about. All food was served hot out of the oven/stove, which is nice. Better to be too hot than too cold. Tuesdays are 1/2 price wine bottle night. They also have beer specials ($3.50). While I'm not a beer drinker, the number of options on tap are the most I've seen in Charlotte. The spread is rather picturesque. I'll take a picture next time I go.  The waitress couldn't have done a better job. She was there when we needed her and gone otherwise, which is perfect for a sports bar. The sound wasn't too loud, as I was able to talk to my friend while we were watching the game. Overall, this is a great sports bar with great service. Average food, but above and beyond when it comes to what makes a sports bar, the SPORTS and the BAR.",

    "text": "With a grill and Taphouse, I feel the need to review both menus. First the drinks: the drink menu is a separate menu from the main, physical menu and it displays on a iPad. I have two main issues with this, this the 3 star rating. The first issue is that I do not want to be touching a device everyone else has been using. I fully understand that everything can be cleaned just the same way as a menu can, but with the main menu being physical and the drink menu being virtual, it was already awkward to transition back and forth anyways to get a good pairing. My second issue with the menu is that it did not update to match current day prices for specials. I feel like that is part of the convenience of having a iPad in the first place, but not accurately reporting prices just seemed weird. The drinks are also a bit expensive, which I thought was odd considering the location. The food menu, on the other hand, was really solid. A good selection from flatbreads to burgers gave a bit of local flair to the menu, though I didn't see anything that struck me as particularly original or creative. Not saying every place has to be, it's just a nice touch to me. Overall, good place to try, but I personally won't return.",

We had 12:00 reservations for 20 and were brought upstairs to a table that was already setup for us, with TVs all over the place.  And, on my way in I did peak at the downstairs area and it looks awesome, TVs everyone and a great atmosphere.  Back to lunch...We had two servers that were ready to take our drink orders and walk through the specials of the day.  We all placed are orders and shortly after food was delivered fresh, hot and as I have experinced in other Duckworth's location, great! With 20 people there were a variety of different menu item ordered, but of the ones I heard about, the margarita flatbread, the philly's, and the cheeseburger (which was the special of the day), everyone enjoyed them tremendously. I went with the chicken philly and added grilled peppers with the already included onions and provolone cheese with fries. The sandwich was piping hot so the chesse melted all over and was SO freakin good I cannot stop thinking about it. And the fries, fresh cut, hot and just the perfect amount of salt.  Overall this was one of the best lunch experiences I have seen with a large group and definitely would recommend this location to anyone, and you know I will be back.",

Turns out I was right. We have been back twice since that visit and on both visits, everything was excellent. The food was great, the service was, as well and the beer selection, as always was stellar. While it's hard to go above 4 stars for a place that features \"bar food\" this place justifies the 5 star rating. Besides being a great place for a bite and drinks, the people who run this place listen to you and truly pay attention to your concerns. We will continue to make Duckworth's Uptown one of our \"go to\" places when we're Uptown.",

Food was incredible and came out at lightning speed. Probably less than ten minutes after I ordered (and it was hot!).

Well over 100 beers on tap - Ipad menus - jam packed rows of flat screens. For some it can be a bit overwhelming and others a feast for the senses. I was also impressed with the amount of natural light in the main bar; it's nice to be able to see who you're talking with.   The beer list is well selected. I enjoyed a Tropical IPA from the Sierra Nevada Beer Camp series that had all three of my favorite hops in it. Our waiter was friendly, brought beer samples and didn't pout when we just ordered drinks. I don't even mind the \"we card everyone policy\". I have yet to eat at Duckworth's (the main dining area) but it's definitely on my \"to do\" list. If it's anything like the food they serve in the Cellar portion, I'm certain it's good. As for the rest, I could sit and drink here all day long without running out of choices.",

The food was good as well. My friend had tacos and the Caesar wrap. We also ordered the queso for an appetizer and it was pretty good. The Philly cheesesteak was my favorite though. I will definitely be back.",

But, the beer selection and amount of TVs in the bar area just can't be rivaled!   We prefer sitting in the bar. Stools are first come, first served and even on the busiest nights, we can usually wedge ourselves into a spot within 5-10 minutes of arriving. From any seat in the bar, you can see no less than 10 TVs. Swivel your head just a bit and TV viewage increases to 20. The crowd here is usually fun and lively, too. You can almost always find someone cheering on your team.",

The management my want to send them to the Disney school; it would perhaps bring them to the standard hospitable level.

When our server came to take our order I just spouted something out that wasn't even one of my top contenders. I had the fish tacos and would not get again. There was too much fish on them, I know thats not something people normally complain about but they were hard to eat. I also didn't like all of the pineapple and mango in the salsas. I should have went with the buffalo chicken philly. I will definitely go back to try! We started with the fried banana pepper rings which were really good and my brother really liked his cobb salad.

Since our group was not familiar with the menu, our server patiently walked us through the many options.  We noticed the blurb near the wings and inquired if they were really good.  Needless to say, the wings and the Taphpusr Flatbread did not disappoint.  Our server, Thurston was attentive, promptly refilled drinks and frequently checked on us.  I could not believe how reasonable the food was, especially once I saw the portion sizes.  The atmosphere was festive and having the variety of screens was a delight.  We will definitely be back!",

I think it needs options for \"light beer\" or \"hoppy beer\" instead of just listing them because its quite overwhelming! Overwhelming continues to the food menu as well, its huge!

    "text": "We had our Goddaughter for a Saturday and (had planned to) end our evening at a restaurant close to Duckworth's for dessert.  Since they were sold out of what we really wanted, we called Duckworth's to place a pick up order for three desserts to go.  We were told it would be just a few minutes, and about 10 mins later we showed up at the hostess stand to get our order.  The girls there acted confused and there was some commotion and it became clear our order was never placed.  No big deal we thought.  How long can it take to put three desserts in a bag?  Answer: 35 mins.  Yes, we were told to head to the bar to pick up our order \"in about four minutes\".  The bartender was friendly, but we kept getting told \"it's coming in just another couple of minutes\".  We had an 11 year old with us and didn't plan to have her in a bar on a Saturday night, let alone for that amount of time to pick up desserts we had phoned in 45 MINUTES earlier.  Keep in mind all three desserts were pre-made and all they had to do was take them out of the fridge and put them in a bag.  And the one dessert that was the assorted cupcakes still had the nutritional info on the plastic box and said \"made by Cheesecake Factory\".  Poor and sloooooow service for absolutely no reason.  By the time we left the bar had half emptied out.  Won't be back.  Just unacceptable service.",

I haven't tried everything on the menu, but I've never had a meal there I didn't like or love. Great beer selection, but it's their prices that drop them from 5 to 4 stars. I don't believe they pour full pints. They pour 12-14oz drafts. That along with the fact that they need a $1.50 across-the-board cut on their beer prices makes them an every 3rd weekend stop for me instead of an every week place. Their beer selection has something for ALL beer lovers.",

The iPad for the beer list was kind of amazing, as, evidently, was the beer list itself. I'm not much of a beer guy, but evidently their tap room was a connoisseur's dream.  The food was okay, nothing too great. The sweet-and-bold wing sauce was decent, but I'm not sure if it should be a best-of-Charlotte winner. The pulled pork was dry and didn't have as much flavor as I would have expected. I had to drench it in barbecue sauce in order to get it chewable. Their coleslaw was the highlight of the evening - I could have taken a couple of pounds of that home with me and eaten it all night. The menu itself was comprehensive, but it could stand an iPad or some better organization. It was tough to find what I wanted, especially with each page having different side items that wound up being specific to the page.  The service? Holy crap. The service would make the Baby Jesus cry. Our server, Lex, is the slowest human being on the face of the earth. She has the attention span of an ADHD puppy and the trundle speed of a very dizzy baby turtle. It took one of my dinner companions more than thirty minutes to get a beer and it took me an hour to get my food. Well, most of my food. She forgot two different things and had to go back and, I'm assuming, got lost navigating the Maze of Trials that leads to the kitchen and back. We asked about a specific beer on the list, only to receive \"I haven't really bothered to learn about beers. I'm not sure how long I'm going to be working here anyway\" as our response. What the shit, Lana. After we kept asking her to refill our drinks (a process that took ~15 minutes each time), she really let her ghetto come out, giving me an attitude that was worthy of Medea.  All in all, they put effort into this place, which was nice. I might try it again when I'm back in Charlotte, but I'm going to try my best to avoid Medea's younger sister if I do come back. Food? Decent. Service? Absolutely worthless.",

Great fresh tasting ingredients on an amazing crust. Fun atmosphere if you like a bar feel. Great location in uptown. Definitely a place to check off your list to try! Oh, and please try their potato skins - they are A-mazing!",

    "text": "We frequent this location but the visit we had Monday was by far the worst we have ever had. It was about 11pm when we came in and we ordered blue cheese chips, as an app, chicken fingers and a salad. After about 35 minutes we get our main course and then 5 minutes later get our apps. Now it wasn't a big deal because this kitchen is always super slow and we never get our food in order. The fries however, were dark, dry and salt less. I then ordered sweet potato fries hoping they would be better and it took over 20 minutes and the bar tender having to go back to the kitchen to get them. They were better than the fries but not by much.  The real problem I had was that the bartender, Kasey, seemed to be the only one working and was dealing with multiple bar guests as well as having to answer the phone and call the manager in the office repeatedly to help the kitchen that was crashing.  The kitchen is always slow late night here but tonight was the worst it has ever been. We were told there was 1 guy!!! That is ridiculous! I know how big that kitchen is and there should never be one guy alone, on top of having to do all the dishes. I can only imagine he was there until 5am!  The new GM being a \"numbers guy\" and cutting down on staff has not only shown a disrespect for the staff making one do the job of 4 but also showing you don't care about your guests because the food quality suffers and guest experience suffers by having to wait 45 minutes for something that takes 10.  Thanks to Kasey for taking care of us like always. I will continue to come here for the beer but I will make sure my stomach is full before entering.",

I have never seen such density of tvs. If you want to watch a game, come here.  However, I  came for the food, and that did not disappoint. I honestly can't remember what I had the first time I  came but the last time, I had the g4illed salmon salad. It was amazing. The salmon was grilled perfectly,  the lettuce was crispy. Very good and a large portion.  We were a large party amd the service was great. Drinks were refilled often and the food came out in a decent amount of  time. Ill definitely be back.",

This time around, the experience leaned more towards the mediocre. I went with a few people on a Sunday evening during Memorial Day weekend. It wasn't busy which is what we were looking for but became busier the later it got. We sat in the bar area at the bar. The bartender was friendly but took a little while to get around to us. We ordered 10 wings with  1/2 being lemon pepper and  1/2 being garlic parmesan, extra crispy. The wings were bland. The \"sauce\" for the wings was also bland. I ordered a chicken philly without onions and a side of sweet potato fries. The chicken had no seasoning which made the sandwich bland. I would return in the future because I don't remember the food being this underwhelming. Next time I will order something else.",

They have a huge menu so your bound to find something that you like; may just be overwhelmed with all the options to choose from like I am every time.  The crowd varies but it's usually always a steady crowd when I'm there. The service has always been pretty good, not always perfect but it's gets very busy and there's not really a long wait if there's one at all for the times I've been. This is definitely a place for sports fans as there are TVs wherever you turn your head so you can't miss a beat of the game your watching. They have a really good list of drinks on tap and the bar has just about any liquor you want to make all your favorite drinks. I love buffalo and they are here with the options with wings, nachos and a flatbread and best believe I've tried them all and they are so good. I've also have the philly which I enjoyed as well. There's so much on the menu from burgers, wraps, wings, pizza & flatbreads, sub that any mood you are in you will be satisfied.",

Now first let's talk about sports friendly. I mean there are a million TVs in this place, don't worry, you can watch the game at any spot in the restaurant. The vibe is always great on game days, for any sport and the extensive bar area with long tables to eat at with fellow sports fans makes it a great gathering place.  The food is always good. Buffalo chicken nachos that are huge, get them. All of the different type of philly cheese steaks, please get them! My husband constantly gets the chorizo burger which is life! They also have great pizzas, wraps, subs, the list can go on forever. On top of all of that there is an extensive list of drinks on tap.  Service is usually pretty good, not perfect but i understand it can get pretty busy. Still a staple uptown and great place to enjoy a good night with friends.",

TVs galore.... have I mentioned the TVs? TVs EVERYWHERE!!!! Would you know it.... we happened to be in search of a place to enjoy some bar bites, drinks, and to watch a playoff game. We hit the jackpot!  Secondly, we all loved our food and it came out hot and just as described on the menu but the chicken nachos were such a great value. The biggest platter of nachos my nacho loving heart has ever laid eyes on and the toppings weren't cheap or skimpy. The chicken was grilled perfectly and very juicy and flavorful. These were my favorite chicken nachos I've had from a restaurant and if I'm back in charlotte looking for a laid back spot to watch a game, you'll find me devouring these nachos and washing them down with a grey goose & soda.  Speaking of grey goose & soda, our drinks were poured well and service from Hope was superb. There was some confusion about who would be serving us when we first sat down, but after a lengthy wait, Hope came to the rescue and turned our experience around. From the time she greeted our table, everything went up hill and she worked with her manager to offer us a discount for our initial wait.   All in all, this was a pretty awesome sports bar and would be great for a laid back date to watch a game or to hang out with a big group of friends.",

    "text": "Visited for the first time on a Saturday.  Pros:  ambiance and design set-up was terrific to watch sports, the food tasted good, my husband's sirloin meal was a good value at $15.99.  We also liked our large booth and privacy barriers between the booths.  Cons:  The kitchen was extremely slow, our waitress had too many tables and it took forever for my husband to receive his drink (beer).  The Salmon Salad for $14.99 was not a good value for a dinner salad.  Everything was good about it except it was missing lettuce.  It had maybe 10% more lettuce than my husband's side salad.  Arrived at 6:00 pm with what we thought would be plenty of time to have a leisurely meal and get to the Ballantyne Village movie theater (in the same development) by 7:15 to get a decent seat.  When we entered the restaurant, there were customers waiting, but much to our surprise they were able to seat the two of us immediately.  My glass of water came quick but it took well above the average amount of time to take our order and for my husband to receive his beer.  The food took forever.  Also, normally my husband would have received his side salad prior to his main course.  This did not occur, but it actually worked out good for me.  My husband gave me his side salad to make up for the let-down on the Salmon Salad.  I was surprised that the owner didn't have sufficient contingency plans in terms of staffing up.  They knew it would be big business on this evening due to the football playoff games, and it was indeed a full house.  By the time our food came, we had to woof it down, which we resented being forced to do, and then we made it to the theater too late.  All of the regular seats were taken and we had to sit up very close to the screen which was absolutely awful.  If we had not purchased advance tickets, we would not have tried to make the movie.  So buyer beware if you try this place out.  I am not sure if they expect their crowd to be very leisurely, parked in their seat for hours watching the game with customers who don't care how fast their food comes out.",

A bar without bar food.   We spent almost 2 hrs to get crappy sandwiches and missed orders. I think this was a case of an inept kitchen & lousy management screwing the servers.

Perfect for any of your let Duckworth's gets five stars for the beer list it is phenomenal and really easy to navigate on an iPad mini. There is a wide selection of beers both local and from across the country. Perfect for any beer lover.    Food on the other hand is average to above average. It's not the best part that I've ever had but it's by no means the worst. We had the Carolina pulled pork sandwich and it was OK. I will say the wings were pretty good. They were crunchy and spicy in the best way possible, but info prefer a crunchier wing.    All in all I would recommend checking the place out the beer menu is by far worth it and the food is decent.",

The food is exceptional as far as quality and portion size, prices are great, service is Amazing, and the beer selection is like no other. They have introduced an IPad beer menu which makes it a lot easier to select a craft brew without searching through the 3 page paper menu offered at the other locations.  My favorite dishes are the steak fajitas and ribs. Their pizza is also delicious.  As far as parking goes it can be a little tricky especially on weekends. I highly recommend parking in the 7th Street garage which is about a block and a half away. They validate parking at the 7th Street Market for 90 min. You can also go to Brixx and grab a drink to validate for 4 hours.",

I arrived at 11:30, and the three hostesses at the hostess stand seemed perplexed by what to do when I said, \"Table for 2, please.\" They sort of awkwardly stared at each other, and I wasn't sure which one was going to seat me since they were all whispering to each other. Weird. Finally, one of them took me all the way upstairs and to the very back of the room, even though none of the other tables had anyone at them.   My friend met me a few minutes later, and things rapidly improved. Our waiter was nice and a little nervous, but he fairly consistently checked on us and refilled our drinks. I got my usual summer salad, which was on point this time, and my friend got the grilled salmon. A manager stopped by the table to check in, which was a nice touch.  By the time we left around 12:30, the place was fairly full. I'll keep giving it chances since I love the other locations.",

For some reason it seemed like something was missing compared to the other locations, but they just weren't that busy, so i guess that changed the vibe.  Its a local chain, so they are all similar.  I'm not a huge fan of writing reviews on chains, so I'll keep this one short.  There are plenty of other great reviews on here.  I checked out a Chicago Blackhawk's game in honor of Paul C. here.  Please give his review a read.  The daily specials are normally decent deals, but outside of the cheese steak and the garlic fries I've never been that impressed with the food.  I normally complain about the prices, but they are honestly pretty reasonable compared to the competition downtown.  This place is all about the beer in my mind.  There are just way to many beers for me to mention.  Luckily they give you a tablet to explain them all.  My server wasn't that knowledgeable, so I'm glad I had that.  I'm not going to even mention my beers as they rotate them out quite often.  Unless its cold outside, I normally gravitate straight towards the IPA's and pale ales.  They had plenty of choices, even a few I had never tried before.  Loved everything.  I really like the fact that I can get Wicked Weed beers here.  That freak of nature is a great deal on pint night.  Cheaper pints on Mondays and Wednesdays at this location.",

Group ordered all over the place from salmon to steak to burgers & plates were licked clean.   And did someone say fried banana peppers? OMG they are the bomb!  Lightly breaded and just a little spicy, paired with ranch & we're talking heaven  What else is heaven? 150 beers from which to choose!  We asked our waiter to surprise us & he hit it spot on for each of us  Looking forward to more Impossible Burgers in my future!",

It's a great place to catch a game of sports since there are so many TVs in the bar - every other having a different game on.   Both times, we ordered the fried pickles which are pretty gross. Extremely greasy and extremely salty. It honestly feels like you're eating dough that was fried multiple times and then left in a tub of salt for days. I've had their chicken wings as well which are good but nothing crazy.   Although the food kinda sucks, I would be back to catch a game & drink beer.",

Once servers saw me seated they were very attentive. Menu had many choices from fish tacos to pizza to American classics. My order: The roasted corn was sweet and tasty, grilled veggies were tender and flavorful and the grilled bacon cheese chicken was on pointe.  Over 150 beers to choose from and mixed drink knowledge of bartenders from what I heard in conversation was too notch. Oh...and the jukebox/music is always rockin.    Duckworth Grill & Taphouse compliments the downtown atmosphere very well in Charlotte.",

Do u see anything fresh in there? It tasted like Rice-a-roni. The chicken was severely overcooked. My husband ordered their \"signature\" wings which were worse than Little Ceasars. And the beer price? Advertised on the board for $3.50 but rang up at $5 each. What a disappointment bc we walked here after seeing it on Yelp!",

There were like 50 TVs in the bar though which was cool but way too many in my opinion for a restaurant of this size. Each TV was literally .5 cm apart from each other.  We ordered fried pickles for an appetizer which was subpar. It was super deep deep deep fried which was then probably doused in a bucket of salt. It was pretty gross to be honest. I also ordered the \"flatbread\" which was just pizza on naan bread with more cheese, less sauce, and a piece of basil. This was pretty good but ya can't really go wrong with margherita pizzas.   We didn't order any drinks, but the place did get packed within minutes since it was football sunday.",

I was assisted with an order almost immediately. My bar order arrived shortly thereafter and my quick bite arrived not long after.  I ordered the Margherita Chicken with Balsamic Reduction Flatbread. It is prepared with grilled chicken, fresh sliced mozzarella, Roma tomatoes and caramelized onions topped with fresh basil & a balsamic reduction. This was an EXCELLENT choice if I do say so myself! I was thrilled with my quick bite, the glass of house Cabernet while keeping up with the sports programming on the numerous television screens. All told, I can't wait to go back for more to determine if this trend will continue.",

From the local staff reviewing YELP and sincerely getting involved to the management wanting to make things better than right.... I'm excited to write and say 1st, Duckworth's will be worth the try for the fajitas, sweet potato fries, grilled wings and service.   2nd, I'm partial to the Cellar down below and only ventured upstairs because the giftcard purchased at Sam's or Costco can't be used downstairs BUT GET THIS... I should have escalated this concern months ago as the ownership said, \"I don't see why we can't make that happen.\" My word people.. when you get this statement from someone: HE/SHE is a keeper.   3rd, Prompt delivery on the follow up, phone call and everything as promised. With that, I am blunt, direct and honest about Service impacts everything and I'm loyal to great service. This is it!   Now, we will swing back at some point to try the aforementioned items when we want and I'd encourage others to follow the recs from others. All in ALL, I adore the Cellar so it will remain a priority in my life.  While, sweet potato fries and grilled wings will bring me here. :*",

Ended up waiting over an hour for our table.    While waiting we went to grab a drink at the bar.  Orders of beer were both wrong and had to ask for the correct beers.   It was corrected.  The bartender took a beer from me, asked me if I drank from it and then gave it to someone else.  I hadn't, but still..yuck.    Once at the table, service was extremely slow.  Our food arrived and two of our items were wrong.   We ordered pizza and flatbreads.  My daughter got the buffalo chicken pizza without ranch.  It arrived with ranch.  They remade it, but it had about 12 tiny pieces of chicken on it.  My flatbread I asked for no onions and it arrived with onions.  I just picked mine off and ate it because I was starving.    We weren't able to get second rounds of drinks or refills because our waitress was scarce.   We were so fed up and ready to go, we flagged the waitress down to get the check.  What we got was a check folder without a ticket.  We then had to flag her down again to get the ticket.    Restaurant bathrooms were not clean.  Floors were gross and slimy when walking in the restaurant and it wasn't wet.  Nasty.  Wouldn't recommend this joint nor return.",

When first entering, the first thing I notice are all the TVs, basically on every inch of the place. We were seated and it took about 7 mins for someone to take our drinks. As out waiter was taking our drinks, I asked what was in the Pico de Gallo. Granted it isn't a side but if they put it on the nachos, I presumed they had to have it. He told me everything but pickled jalapenos!!! We got it as a side with chips, that shit was nasty!!!!! Who in the hell puts PICKLED JALAPENOS in a pico de gallo?!!! I was sure to leave a note for the chef, I didn't care if she/he got it or not.  Worst part was the STEAK!!! I ordered CENTER CUT SIRLOIN and told him, MEDIUM WELL and these fuckers bring a rubbery ass steak. It then took about 15 MINS for me to get a new one, at that point I spoke to the manager and then it magically appeared out of nowhere. Oh by that time my loaded mashed potato and corn were cold. Oh and the bread was hard as a rock!!!!! Then after everything, these people charged me for my meal. Worst service and food around Charlotte!!!!!",

I didn't hate my meal, I just thought it was OK and overly greasy.   I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich which had some good elements on it, but the chicken breast was so big that it could have fit on two buns which made it super messy. My husband ordered a BBQ sandwich that was supposed to come with slaw on it but did not. I did really like their ranch and cheese fries. They were just super greasy though. They also have a very large beer selection if that's your thing.  Service was a high point. They have a special limited menu for game nights which may have been the root of the issue. Some of the pics on yelp point to more creative choices.",

I really enjoyed that I was able to leisurely go through the beer list from the comfort of a provided iPad, which had options to display beers by brewery, location, and even style. It was easy to understand, easy to see my choices, and therefore easy to order.   We went early on Saturday to watch the UNC v. State game, and found very few people inside. The space is large and comfortable, food was filling, and the staff was attentive and friendly. It's a great sports bar, with almost more TVs than beer taps (I kid), but there's a channel for everyone and every team.",

    "text": "We were visiting from out of town and decided to visit this place. My first impression was that the bar area looked fun. They had many TVs and a huge selection of beer. HOWEVER, they are WAY overpriced. One champagne cocktail drink cost $9 and came in a champagne flute...tiny. I was going to order their margarita, but it was $12 and I was scared to get something tiny for the price, so I didn't.   Then the bartender told us about the growler and pizza special that they had and that it is the best special in town. The special was two growlers and two (two topping) pizzas for $25. We ordered that. Our bill came out and it was $40. When we asked the bartender what happened to the $25 special, he told \"read the small print, it is $5 extra for each growler.\" There was some other unexpected charge on there as well, however, I cannot remember what it was exactly. I told the bartender that they cannot possibly expect people to pay attention to the \"small print\" when they are at the bar drinking.   The reason why this place is getting 4 stars is because once the manager noticed the commotion, he promptly stepped up and comped our bill. We promptly tipped the bartender $10 in return, so the outcome was good.  The pizza was amazing.  I will definitely go there again, but I will be careful about what I order.",

Hands down this is our favorite sports bar - great food, massive beer selection and wall to wall televisions.  Personally we prefer to hang out in the bar, since generally the crowds are into whatever games are on and that adds to the excitement.  They almost always have a nice selection of beers on sale.  Most nights we get the buffalo chicken nachos and it is huge - more than enough for two people.  We also particularly like the Philly cheese steak sandwich and the pizzas are excellent.  Another thing to keep in mind is that they have a take out special where you can get 2 pizzas and 2 growlers for $25 - great deal!",

Not only was the food absolutely amazing the rib-eye oh my gosh it was like eating butter was so good!! So tender and flavorful and man I wish I could get that recipe. In addition Bobby our server was so phenomenal he truly knew his stuff.   He showed us how flavors paired on a the cheese tray.  He knew the menu better than anybody else.  The bartender made me a special sweet-tasting shot out of his imagination and it was sooooo good! The manager Sean was also very kind very pleasant and truly knew the business and clearly likes his customers.  He spent time with my husband and I making sure that we were well taken care of and gave us insight to the history of the restaurant. I truly am impressed.

She enjoyed it too because she ate it and it's a pretty decent size pizza for a kids meal. Probably the same size as the small in the regular menu.   I had an appetizer, the chicken tenders with fries. The chicken tenders were pretty good, I had them cooked in BBQ sauce. The fries were hot when served but they were ok. I didn't really eat them because I didn't care for them much.   My mom had a Caesar salad and it was tasty and fresh for her.   Our waitress was friendly and prompt. She made sure she kept refilling our drinks regularly before they got empty, which was pretty good since we kept drinking them quickly. We were very thirsty since it was around 95 degrees outside. The only reason I'm not giving a 5 was because of the fries. I'm just picky about them.",

Waitress was not friendly and seemed like she wanted zero social contact. Not too busy even though it was during lunch time. She took our drink orders and never came back to refill our drinks even though she had to walk right past our table to deliver food to others. We had to specifically ask multiple times for refills. Buffalo chicken sandwich was the most basic of sandwiches and had next to no sauce on it. No lettuce or tomato was on the sandwich. For those who got tator tots, they received a small handful, nothing that a \"side\" would justify.   I order the large steak and egg philly with no onions. The amount of meat on it was the exact same as the regular version, bearing no difference except for the amount of bread. It also had onions on it after specifically requesting no onions. Had to ask multiple times for other sauces since all orders lacked any resemblance of being appetizing. No where close to being worth a $15 meal. Extremely disappointed and do not recommend to anyone.",

Came here on a Saturday night to watch my Blackhawks kick the $hit out of Anaheim (yeay!) and I asked the Manager to switch the TV at my booth to the specific channel so that I can watch my game. It took a few minutes (their system is HUGE since they have like 75 TV's in the place, if not more), but he got a few TV's switched to the game I wanted, and apparently there were many other Blackhawks fans and we all rooted for our beloved team!  Not sure if they updated their tablets, but, I always thought you couldn't search by style. Well, my waitress said you can, and I typed in \"Belgian\" (as I love strong Belgian ales) and voila, up popped a large selection of Belgian style beers, both domestic and imported. So Yeay to that!  Now my waitress was very knowledgeable about the beers they have there....and she made some damn killer recommendations, most of which I LOVED! In fact, I walked out with a Growler of my fave beer of the night (don't ask me what it was.....I was hammered at that point but it magically STILL wound up in my Fridge even though I have NO earthly idea how I got home, other than it was UBER - Double YEAY to Uber!). I digress....  I ate before I got here but of course when drinking, you do get the munchies, and I continue to claim that Duckworth's has some of the better \"bar food\" that is available in Charlotte. Got some freshly made chips with Ranch dressing, and that always hits the spot....Not too heavy, and yet satisfying.  So IF you can NOT find a beer you like at this location, you just don't like beer! I gave their massive listing a thorough look this time, and 151 ON TAP and some bottles that are available, and you simply have THE BEST BEER SELECTION IN CHARLOTTE!  IF anyone can find a better selection, PLEASE drop me a note cuz I'd love to go there!   Bottom line: BEST Beer Selection in Charlotte, better than average bar food, great service and the ultimate sports bar to watch your favorite game. Thus - FIVE STARS!  Continued Great job Rob Duckworth!  PS - July is supposedly when they open up their new \"ultra premium\" beer bar and Foodie kitchen in the downstairs (basement) location. I had the pleasure of taking a tour down there a couple months ago, and man did it look AWESOME! I cannot WAIT to try out this unique concept of a Foodie Kitchen paired with ultra premium beers......WOW!",

The exploding craft beer scene is pretty awesome for beer fans, but places like Duckworth's pretty much make it easy to try new beers from everywhere with their selection.  This spot Uptown opened a couple months ago - sadly it took the spot of one of my \"go-tos\" when I was a lot younger:  Fox and Hound.  But it's probably for the best.  They pretty much gutted the building and have a fresh bar, dining area, and tons of TVs everywhere.  Staff are friendly and it makes for a great place to meet friends, watch sports, and drink beer!   iPad beer menus make it nice and interactive... and less pressure for the servers to know everything about all the beers they serve.  Either way, it's a solid option for after work drinking, lunch, weekends, and meeting up for dinner/drinks.",

We waited for about 20 minutes after being seated and no one came to our table. We left and no one said anything to us. We had to say something to the hostess about not being served. Very disappointing because we know their food is so good. I will never go back to this location.",

They have many beers on tap, but seem to be missing some local options like Triple C.  The food is better at this location, but the service was lacking both times I sat a table.  They were fast to take my order and the two times I sat at a table there was nobody there.  It took a while for them to get my food.   Once I was finished it took forever both times to get the check.  Then, not only that my biggest pet peeve was hit.  Taking my credit card to run my bill and waiting 15 minutes to get it back.  I feel like I am held hostage when this happens.  The worse thing was I saw my waiter just standing at the end of the table talking to his friends.  Maybe I will just stick to sitting at the bar.",

I found the chips to be stale, but I was only interested in the tacos.    There are daily specials all week long. Stop in and check the place out. Good showing of NC craft beers.",

The beer selection is unbelievable - great local beers and the feel of the bar is very man cave like. Now your wondering why this is a two star review - the service is absolutely terrible. Terrible might even be an understatement. We sat at the bar right in front of one of their work computers so they were in front of us every two minutes. The only time they ever checked on us was when we had full beers. It was a very disappointment experience. Really sucks because this place could be great but it is not worth going to unless they improve the service.   I talked to both the restaurant manager and the district manager who happened to be at the restaurant and they have been receiving similar complaints.   To sum up this review. Stay away from the bar - the bartenders suck. Might be different if you get a table.   The cellar downstairs is awesome and I highly recommend.",

    "text": "I'll start off by saying that I am a server at an upscale restaurant in uptown Charlotte. I have worked in the service industry for many years, starting as a bartender in a pub and then moving on to fine dining service. I have started coming to Duckworth's after work, when I get off late, because they serve food until 2am (awesome) and are a short walk from my apartment. The few times I have been there have been great. I hardly ever write reviews, but I think that my last experience there warrants one. I sat at the bar and a woman greeted me and took my order. Nothing special, I ordered a beer and some food. Well...I found out that the beer that she poured for me was the wrong one, after I had already drank it. I was looking forward to trying a particular new beer. There were also 2 things wrong with my order that I clearly specified to her when ordering. I understand that she was not the bar \"closer\" and was seemingly trying to get out of there, but that is no excuse for careless service; 3 things wrong between my food and beverage order. I also understand having a bad night, but once again, no excuse for 3 things completely wrong. Steve (I found out his name by looking at the receipt) took over the bar as the \"closer\" and realized the mistakes and corrected them. He has waited on me a few times and always has a great attitude and gives wonderful service. He was the only one behind the bar when I was winding down my meal. He had a full bar along with \"service bar\" and handled it like a pro. Steve, thank you for your wonderful serivce, attention to detail and hard work. I'll be back.",

I used to frequent Fox quite often, considering the location... So I immediately turned left as I walked in the door. Just kidding!The bar is now to the right. I've only been on the first floor, where there is ample seating. The lighting is always extremely bright- day & night. Too bright for my liking. And the TVs... Holy cow. For someone who doesn't even own a TV, this is overwhelming. Definitely a great spot to catch numerous games, if you don't get vertigo first. I do enjoy there extensive beer list, which is on a easy to use IPad. Drink specials are pretty good... Most beers are $3.50 on M & W, but I believe most are between 11-14 oz pours. 1/2 price bottles of wine on Tuesday. There Hop Man Beer Club is also very easy to sign up for. I try to drink local as much as possible, and there is a decent rotation of Charlotte breweries. I haven't had a full meal yet, more of apps/ bar food. The only thing that has stuck out so far is the Sweet & Bold wing sauce. Absolutely delicious! I could honestly eat this on anything. Staff is pleasant. You can tell that many are still feeling things out, which is expected.  Atmosphere could use some work, but overall pretty decent. Definitely more of a drinking spot than a place to enjoy food.",

Seriously, if you can't find a beer here you want, well then the problem is you.  The beer menu is on an ipad. You can even search keywords. This makes my quest to drink #allthepumpkin beers much easier. I'm a huge fan of Duckworth's philly cheesesteaks and pizza. I should probably branch out and try other things, but I just can't seem to quit you buffalo chicken philly.   This place is perfect for football, basketball, baseball, and any other fill-in-the-blank sport. We spent four hours here Saturday with a group of seven people. Seven people who all had parlays. What does that mean? Well, they were able to watch all 42384729837948273 games they needed to see. When the 3:30 games ended, they even changed four TVs for us. Don't worry, we all made sure that no one was watching those screens.  Service has been kind of hit or miss for me. Saturday our service was fantastic. We watched the Cubs wildcard game here a few weeks ago and it was a cluster. I felt bad for everyone working there because it was obvious they weren't prepared for the crowd.   This location has different menu specials each day. Looking for late night food? They serve their entire menu until 2am.",

The place was packed but after a brief wait a table opened up and all of the seats at our table had a view of at least one television tuned into the game.  Duckworth's has the right snacks for watching the game. We had a chicken quesadilla, some boneless wings (two flavors) and a plate of the chicken nachos. The quesadilla and the wings split up nicely but the plate of nachos was insanely huge. A LOT of chips, cheese and chicken on this monster platter. Excavating around the edges worked well because the chicken and \"stuff\" was more inside than on top.  Where Duckworth's wins is their amazingly organized beer list. Sure, some places print stuff out. But no, not this spot. They have iPads for the table that list their beers, provide descriptions and prices. So if you're looking for something different that perhaps you've never had before, this is the spot.  We enjoyed our time. Decent service and way lots of televisions.",

It was a rainy day so it wasn't too busy. With that being said they allowed us to choose where we would like to sit and we chose the bar area. I loved the TVs and uppity atmosphere. MATT was our server and I must say he was incredibly knowledgeable about the many tap beers they offer. He took the time to listen to what we were used to drinking and he directed us to the perfect beers... so tasty, it was perfect. We order the CHICKEN QUESADILLA as an appetizer and omg it was incredible. Not your average skinny quesadilla. For our main entrees I had the steak fajitas and my boyfriend had a cheese burger with sweet potato fries. Wow the fajitas where amazing I ate it all. The meat had incredible flavor and the rice as well. We even ordered a quesadilla to go :)  We even requested to have one of the channels changed so we can see the Grammys and they went out of their way to please us and meet our needs. Thank you so much for making us feel special and being great host while we were in town visiting. This is a place you must check out. You won't regret it.",

I have to say the seating situation is a bit tough on Sundays, so if you want to get a good seat, come before noon (ie: before they start serving booze).   The first time I came with some friends and the 1PM games were on... someone cheered and I didn't know what TV to watch... it's definitely a sensory overload when the Panthers are playing. However, if your team is playing the 1PM games and the Panthers are not playing, you'll be able to watch the games in relative peace.",

There was a very large variety of drinks with multiple tvs at the bar. But the biggest reason why we kept coming back was the awesome bartender that was there!!! I really wish I could remember his name, but I kept forgetting it. I do know that he was originally from Minnesota. He was super friendly and just made us want to post up there all night! He was honest and funny and helpful with picking delicious beverages. They have so many different beers on tap, so it was nice being able to sample a little something that was recommended before ordering a full glass. Very glad we stumbled upon this place and we know that if we lived in town, we would easily become regulars here!",

    "text": "I was super excited to try out Duckworths! My boyfriend has been here before and he loved it, said they have awesome wings! So when myself and a few coworkers were planning a lunch on Saturday I suggested Duckworths....we were not too pleased.   Overall, the food was just average. I got the summer salad. It was first brought to me without any dressing so I had to ask for it. Once I added it to my salad, I wish I hadn't. It was too oily and kind of ruined the \"summery\" taste. And they also forgot to put the Gorgonzola cheese on it, bummer. My friends burger was good, but she asked for sweet potato fries sweet sweet and they weren't brought out that way. So she asked for new ones and they did bring out another order but they looked the same. Another friend got the blue cheese chips which weren't terrible but thy were drowning in blue cheese with no where near enough chips. Once the chips were gone, there was almost a full bowl of clue cheese. So needless to say, we weren't too impressed with the food. Maybe we just ordered non popular items.   The service was odd....our waiter was super awkward and every time he came over it felt like he was waiting for us to initiate the conversation. I've been a server for a long time and that's definitely not the most effective way to get the attention of your tables! After one of our friends left and asked for her check early, he brought it but never came back for the rest of us. It had been about 45 minutes before we had to flag him down for our checks, which was okay because we were talking but in any other situation, way too long to wait for a check. Service was mediocre at best, especially since it wasn't even busy!   The atmosphere was great! Tons of tvs, decorated really nicely, and beer taps everywhere which was cool. It was a fun environment and definitely a good place to watch the game or go have a few beers at the bar. I'll probably try Duckworths out again just because I've heard so many good things and their menu is huge so I'd like to test some other items out.",

The beer selection however was outstanding with prices very very very reasonable.  Food and drinks in the Cellar was more expensive but also prepared with more care.  The Cellar is more strict with dress code and code of conduct (no standing at the bar, you must be seated).  Choose your adventure when you get there!",

I get it if it's a busy time, but I've been in at a later time and it was still slow. I'd say they're understaffed. the salads aren't cut and it's really annoying.  If you're here for lunch with work friends, you can expect to be there for at least an hour. Unless you want scarf down the food in minutes, you're not going to get out under an hour.

Long story: I called in a carry out order this evening of wings and sweet potato fries. I was told the order would be ready in 30 min. It was hard to find parking, so I called 30 min later to make sure it was ready and it wasn't. I was told they needed an extra 10-15 min. I walked in 15 mi later and had to wait for them to \"find\" my order. I paid and was home 8 min later. My food was COLD. Which makes me think it really was ready within the first 30 min but the person who answered the phone didn't really check. My chargrilled wings were BURNT. 3 of 10 of the chargrilled wings were so burnt that they went straight to the trash. My regular wings were dry.",

Oddly enough this was the second bad experience at this location. Clearly the management has created an environment where the servers are not held to that \"high\" of a standard.

Lots of tap beers (very nice), decent food, and the service is pretty ok. Not super great, but decent. The bartenders are friendly, albeit a little slow. I think sometimes they simply are a bit understaffed.  Last night we stopped in for a quick drink and a snack before heading next door to a show. We ordered a Caprese - which was fresh and tasted fine. The problem occurred with our beer. Both my wife and I ordered beer that was located in the center section of the taps (I had a Bell's Two Hearted, can't remember what the wife had) - the beer was foaming very badly, and they were having a hard time getting good pours out of the taps. The bartender mentioned that they had recently cleaned the lines and they were trying to get the lines calmed down after that.  Although the beer tasted ok (maybe a bit off, but not terrible) I am convinced that there was some type of cleaner still in the lines. We left Duckworths, went to the show (wife had one beer there and myself a glass of red wine) and then we went home. Today, we have spent the entire day in bed - not sick from food poisoning, but from some type of poisoning. Other than the two different drinks we had at the theater, Duckworths was the only place we had food and drink at.  I don't think we are going to die... but we have both felt pretty awful all day. Can I prove it was something in the beers lines? No..... but my common sense leads me to that conclusion.  I have never seen beer that out of control foamy.... something was clearly wrong or still in the lines.",

Will have to re-evaluate once I am in with wife for dinner or lunch.  This was just a short visit.  Lots of beers, 110 on tap and you can count on the serving temperature being right as they have three separate and specific temperatured rooms for the kegs.  If you don't want a draft, go for one of the 700 beers in their cellar in bottles.  Quite a variety and worth a tour if they will allow you in.  Entertainment is downstairs in the cellar, most is live and there are a variety of events.  And remember that this is a sports bar and the number of TVs and resulting coverage of sports events is fantastic.  A bit too noisy for me, but it sure is popular.  Lots to eat and drink as well as watch.  Worth more investigation.",

We we're promptly sat and given menus. After a few minutes our waiter arrived and took drink orders. My husband decided to order a flight of beers and was given a pen and paper to write down his order, he gave his order to the waiter a few minutes later.  After about 10 minutes the waiter returned to take our food order and my husband asked about his beer flight and was told it was on it's way.  We ordered a chicken sandwich, a burger, a personal BBQ chicken pizza, 2 kids meals (one pizza and one chicken tenders) and an order of housemade chips with ranch.  The waiter asked if we would like the kids meals and the chips out in first and we said yes.  The chips came out first, they were tasty (downside being that the ranch served with them was very warm - as if it has sat under a heat lamp for several minutes). About 15 minutes later the kids meals arrived...they looked good, but neither kid liked their meals. Next out came the chicken sandwich and burger. My husband said his burger was fine, nothing special. My chicken sandwich only took up half the bunch and was a little tough. Our friend's pizza took an additional 5 minutes to come out after we arrived....she stated it wasn't very good and she only ate about half of it.  Overall the food was mediocre, service felt very slow (especially since it wasn't busy), and the restaurant didn't feel very clean (floors slippery, bathroom had toliet paper on floor). I will most likely choose somewhere else next time.",

    "text": "So disappointed. We love Duckworth's for their phillys and nachos. We can't always make it to eat in the restaurant so we order delivery. Now tonight was the 3rd and last time we will order from them again. The nachos come with cheese only, no toppings included (all 3 times) and the phillys never come as we order them as they are always missing toppings and condiments also. I know that they should be different bc we have ordered these same things in house numerous times. Maybe we're the fools for continuing to order but we know what we like and hoped every time that it was going to be different. Especially considering the prices they charge especially for the nachos. They are $17 and all we get are chips cheese and chicken?? This is the fault of the restaurant and not the delivery service as the restaurant is the one who packs up the bag and hands it over to the driver. It's so careless and very frustrating to once again receive an order that is incorrect or missing items and doesn't live up the the description on the menu.",

    "text": "What a great place to watch a game, they have a crazy amount of TVs! We came here for the first time on Sunday to watch the Panther's game. Come early, its always packed on game day. We had to wait for seats, luckily the patrons watching the earlier game happily gave their seats to us during the last minute of their game. Our server, Amanda, was awesome, very attentive and was close by whenever we needed her. The staff as a whole was also very helpful, the game wasn't running on a TV near me but a server was happy to quickly change the channel to the Panthers game.   Duckworth's has a great selection of beer on tap, it was pretty fun to check out the variety on their iPad system. I stuck with a Hefenweizen all night while the bf had his Bell's Two Hearted Ale, we were pretty happy with the drinks. I switched to rum and ginger ale in the last quarter of the game, reasonably priced for game day. We also ordered a 10 piece boneless wing order and a regular size of garlic fries, I wasn't a huge fan of the food but it did the job. The garlic fries were greasy and needed seasoning. The wings were crispy but lacked the heat we were looking for in wings. It was more of a mild than hot sauce. Neither of us finished our food, but we weren't really here for the food. It just would have been nice if it was out of this world.   All in all, we had a great time and will be back for more! Cheers.",

    "text": "Not sure what the issue is with this location.  But it was a depressing and terrible experience.   I was excited to go because my go to spot in Huntersville has been consistently excellent.   We have been going to Huntersville atleast once a week, sometimes two in the football season, therefore, I think I can honestly say, WTF is wrong with downtown?  I get a wait, no problem, but 30 minutes to sit us in the upstairs area?  Really, only one table up there had patrons.   A very loud and drunk 20 something party was going on, combined with the tin ceiling made it impossible to hear my wife sitting across the table from me.    I ask to be reseated and was told I had to wait another hour.    The first server was new.  Okay I get new, but give the guy a server trainer.  He could not answer any questions about what is on tap.  On top of that, he did not know the menu.   Really?   Okay, we got a second server.  She was beyond stressed.  Running downstairs to the bar to get drinks for the upstairs is just stupid ---- 20 minute wait between drink runs and that is if she bothered to check on us.  No water refills........  The food absolutely sucked.   My Smoakhouse Philly Cheese Steak was a joke.  I added whiz......   The portion was tiny, I could see bun.  The added cheese whiz was a couple drops.   Huntersville - please train them, you guys do it good - with a giant ass sandwich.  For $14.99, I do not want to get Subway portions, you get me?  On top of that, the meat was over cooked, as in dry-carmelized-nastiness.  My wife had her normal pizza supreme, she says that the Huntersville location is the best supreme pizza she has ever had, especially the crust, it has a sweetness to it......   Downtown, way to destroy a pizza with to much grease and soggy crust.  Our friends ordered the Smoked wings and bbq plate.  They said the bbq was awful.   They said that the bbq did not taste fresh, it was soggy like the stuff you get in the grocery store that has sat all day.  They did say the wings were decent.  I am not sure what the problem is.  Huntersville and Mooresville rock it.  To many choices downtown to be let down again.     Edit - they took the iPads out, now there cheap piece of paper beer menu is just that......a waste of paper.",

I went upstairs to look at the establishment.   It was not blocked  off.  I heard one of them say, he \"he went upstairs\".   If its not available  to the public.  Why is is open to access?  I came down the stairs the female manager was standing there with a fake pagent smile.  Watching my every move.  I went to smoke outside.  I saw the same female manager and two guys go around the corner in the alley for a few minutes .  Not sure if she was prostituting  or getting  high.   (True story) Worried about me.  You need to worry about your employees how they conduct themself and how your paying consumers  are treated.    And i dont want anything  for free.

Today, January 1st, was the first time I went in and had a burger, I ordered the APPLEWOOD SMOKED BACON CHEESEBURGER, with a side of fries and coleslaw...and a sweetened ice tea.  If you LIKE watching TV, you would have thought you died and went to Heaven. TV's ALL over the place..can you say..'sensory overload' boys & girls. Took some getting use to, just focus on a Poker Game going on on one TV was all I could handle.  Walked in and waited less than 2 minutes to be seated. The host actually asked me, which I am surprised..asked have I been waiting long. Nice of her. Can't remember my waiter's name, but he was training 'The New Guy'. Been there and done that. He made me feel comfortable and the person he was training also.  I didn't timed how long it took for my food to arrive, but my waiter told me that it wouldn't be long, and it wasn't. First thing I tried was the coleslaw. Not sweet, you could actually taste everything in it, nothing overpowering at all..NICE. The fries were the biggest plate of fries I have ever seen for 'lil bit ol me.' I think 2, 3 forkfuls and I knew it was going out the door with me. The Burger... First of all ANYTHING WITH BACON ON IT...you can't go wrong, is what I say. What I LIKE MOST about this burger..the shape. To apply ketchup and salt, you actually have to deconstruct it. Upon doing this, I notice that who ever cooked it made sure that it was at the proper temp. I say this because the burger was in 2 pieces. From my experience being on a grill, I always make sure that it's at the right temp by going inside of it, and the only way to do that is to 'break it' so that you can get a reading. I was surprised by the mayo, or whatever that white creamy stuff was..because I was already 3/4's thru the burger and BAM, there it was. In my book, that is just GREAT! Every bite had all the ingredients, a way a burger is suppose to be put together.  You know how you wish you can have a place that serves excellent food RIGHT across the street from where you live... Duckworth's IS that place.",

We both ordered the lunch special of a bbq sandwich and home cut chips. The chips were perfect and went great with the ranch which you could tell was homemade. I love eastern style bbq so the sandwich was perfect and went really well with the homemade coleslaw that was served on the side. He brought us bbq sauce on the side as well and I normally don't like bbq sauce but this one was really good.

    "text": "Great beer selection, below average food. Service was awkward, not knowledgable, and overall not the best. iPads explaining beers were really neat! Lots of TVs. Lots of homeless outside and I felt unnerved walking back to car. Was disappointed that I asked for a bottle of beer. They brought it and it was huge.  Wound up costing $18 and I didn't drink it because it was terrible. There are no prices on menu so I wish waitress would have told me the beer I chose was huge and expensive! I assumed bottles of beer were all typical 12 oz and under $7 or so. Guess the assumption was my fault but I'm not s huge beer person and would never have even thought to ask the price!",

The server did not know anything about beer, which used to be unacceptable for Duckworths. The food for our party came out all at different times and was of super low quality. This has not been my experience before at the other locations. The only thing that didn't suck was the banana peppers. I know it's a newer location, but get it together Duckworths.",

However the drinks are good with a good selection of beers and a digital beer menu to help you narrow down your vice. Cheers.",

The manager refused to give us the larger portion at the small portion price note did he allow us to simply put the small portions on the larger bun. Very rude management. On top of everything else they were not serving any mixed drinks. Overall very dissatisfactory experience.",

    "text": "We were pretty excited to see that we were getting a new bar in uptown, went the first week they were open. So impressed by the beer selection. You get an ipad instead of a menu with all the beers on draft, bottled, mixed drinks, etc., its nice to browse all the beers. Only complaint with the ipad is that you cannot search by beer type, so you can't filter out all the ipas or porters or whatever you're in the mood for. They also do a beer club, so we immediately signed up for that. Drink specials cant be beat especially given the beer selection. We watched 2 UNC games here, both times we were told the wait would be over an hour but they managed to get us in after waiting only 30 minutes. Food was good: sweet potato fries with the sweet glaze are amazing. The service was great, we had some confusion with the check but the manager came over and was super helpful getting things straightened out. Can't wait to keep coming back and rack up those beer points.",

    "text": "Awesome tap selection, but the praise stops there. Although the bar was fairly empty when we stopped in on a Sunday night, the bartender/server was not attentive at all. She was nice, but we had to flag her down for all of our needs. My husband ordered the fried pickles, which were the MOST SALTY things we have ever eaten. I am actually a big salt fan, but these were way overboard. The texture and dipping sauce would have been enjoyable if we could get past the salt. The restaurant also had a really commercial feel, maybe thats why the staff didn't seem to care. Despite the tap selection and great location, it was a disappointing experience.",

    "text": "Both times I have patroned this establishment the beer and food as been great but the service is so SLOW.  We sat at the bar both times.  The first time our bartender took forever to do everything.  Greet us, give us menus, take our beer orders, give us our beers, etc.  I finally got my glass of water when my food came even though I ordered it before I ordered my beer.  (It was after lunch rush, there were about 5-7 people at the bar).  The bartender was more interested in talking with the three gentlemen in the middle of the bar, and one was sleeping! Head down, eyes closed, straight up sleeping while she chated with his friends.  She finally brought me bone-in wings, when I ordered boneless (so I got to wait for them to fix that too).  Another bartender got on shift and I finally got my water I had ordered.  But when we were ready to pay out, got our check right away, guess they couldn't wait for us to leave.  The second time, the same thing slow service when we sat down at the bar, at least there were two bartenders this time?  Started the same way and just continued that way the whole time.  The person with me ordered a beer and the glass showed up cracked, when we told the bartender, she was like \"oh yeah, that sucks\" and continued on with her job! didn't even occur to her to switch out the broken glass, the other bartender caught the interaction and corrected her, but OMG!  The same bartender, who wanted my friend to drink glass, was also allowing her bra straps to show out of her work shirt and it was a little.. uh.. too much.  We actually only had an app, and opted for dinner elsewhere because of the service.  The beer selection and food are great, but the service is just annoying.",

It came with roasted veggies and island rice.  Everything was seasoned perfectly and delicious.  The two who ordered salmon were pleased also.  However, their salmon was a little under-cooked in the center.  The server said that it's cooked \"medium\".  The manager apologized, cooked it a little longer and ended up taking those off of the bill.  They loved their sides though - sweet, sweet potatoes were fantastic.  You can also order them salty.  We will definitely be back.  Nice change from Rock Bottom which is right across the street.",

We worked with Kenny (manager) and Rob Duckworth, and they were so helpful. Rob helped us design a meal package within our budget - and we still had everyone's favorite on the menu!! The food was incredible (as usual), and everyone had more than enough. We were able to take some leftovers home and feed our out-of-town visiting family too!  They have a projection and sound system installed in the room, which allowed us to play our own slideshow/powerpoint, with music, and then enjoy our own hand selected music during dinner. The controls were very easy to operate! They even allowed us to come in and decorate before hand with some special items to help us extend that intimate, family setting. We had two special servers helping us throughout the evening - and they were just perfect. Quick, helpful, accommodating and friendly - even to helping us box our leftovers.  All in all - Duckworth's was the perfect solution for us. I highly recommend this location, and encourage all to check out their private room for private functions like business meetings, working lunches, showers, rehearsal dinners, private parties of any sort.   We could not have had such a marvelous, special night without Duckworth's.",
