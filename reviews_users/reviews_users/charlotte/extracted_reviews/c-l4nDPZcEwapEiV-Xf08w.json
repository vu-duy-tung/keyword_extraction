    "text": "Since our 5-year-old daughter is spending the week with the grandparents, the missus and I are taking advantage of a well-deserved week off from the rigors of parenting a willful, precious and unruly child. So we got ourselves dolled up - if you consider me wearing a 16-year-old yet still fabulous looking black t-shirt courtesy of Banana Republic, a pair of blue jeans and some snazzy-looking brown loafers - and dined here. It had been some time since we'd eaten at Ilios; the times before, we'd enjoyed our dining experience, even if the restaurant was a bit small and often overcrowded.  IN has since undergone a renovation. Thankfully, it's expanded dramatically, so no more having to crowd yourself in front of the bar to await your table. There are plenty more tables, along with a few more outside. We would have opted for outdoor dining, but lately the humidity around the CLT has been nothing short of murderous, and I really didn't feel like dining out feeling as if I'd been draped with a wet towel. The former IN had more of a rustic feel; the new IN now sports a more upscale look, not too bright and flashy. Tasteful. Discreet. Nice touces all around.  I especially like the look the waitstaff was rocking: a casually wrinkled blue oxford button-up, blue jeans, and Chuck Taylors. Ever one on staff. Pretty cool, if you ask me.  One worry I always have when it comes to renovations is whether or not management can resist tinkering with the menu. Good thing very little has changed from the last dine my wife and I dined here. For appetizers, we opted for the calamari - crispy yet never overdone, with some delcious marinara and aoili dipping options - and the tzaziki. Perfect.  My wife enjoyed her Greek Country Salad with a nice-sized chicken breast, and I thought my wood-fired Piemonte pizza - prosciutto, fennel sausage, pepperoni, and gorgonzola - was quite tasty. Really, there's no way you can make a bad menu choice here. There's the right balance of authentic, without making too many concessions, and you're not bombarded with TOO many choices. Good menu, really.  IN is the right kind of restaurant for a first date or a get-together with friends. Last night must have been Ballantyne/Providence CC Desperate Housewives Night; between the overdressed housewives vamping at the bar, sipping their Sluttinis or whatever fancy and colorful cocktails, and the trio of desperates raving endlessly about  how titilating \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" is - seriously, has that book become required reading for bored suburban housewives everywhere? - yet bellyaching about all their husbands want to do is have sex with them, and sex is so EWWWWWWWW, well, you won't be bored eavesdropping on their conversations about their First World Problems. Woe is them and their Zumba-fit bodies.  (Actually, I think every night is Ballantyne/Providence CC Desperate Housewives Night, so make a reservation and enjoy the sights and sounds.)  This place is another winner for the Stratos Restaurant Group, who also own Big View Diner (one of our go-to places) and Nolen. So we'll definitely make it back to Ilios Noche from time to time. You should too.",

And then it was \"discovered.\"      The scene on a recent Friday night included a live band with amps cranked to stadium level.  It's been difficult enough to hold a conversation on a regular night due to the noise level.  The music might have been decent, but who could tell as nothing, and I mean NOTHING, except for the table of screeching drunks, was audible over the drums.  Add in the smirking creepy old guy groping his very young female escort (crotch-length skin-tight dress) - well, you get the picture.  This is okay for a bar or club, but not a white tablecloth restaurant.   The food is good, but not good enough to counterbalance the noise and the raucous crowds. Also, reservation times are not honored (add 15-30min).  We're giving up on this one.",

    "text": "Had the pleasure of dining here with my wife on a Friday evening. Rather packed and bustling inside. We chose to sit outside.   Our server was nice and gave us the rundown of the menu. Drinks, pleasantries, the whole shebang.   The atmosphere is pretty plain. Nothing daring or over the top. I recommend sitting outside if it is nice.   Do yourself a favor and order the zucchini and eggplant chips. Lightly salted, nice crunch and served with a refreshing tzatziki.   I ordered the spaghettini and meatballs. A generous helping of pasta and the meatballs were very robust and hearty. I wasn't disappointed at all.   My wife ordered the Greek salad. Pretty standard and nothing to complain about. Nice and fresh ingredients. A nice touch with the cucumber, I might add. Good balance with the striking flavors of the kalamatas.   We ended up ordering dessert. A rarity for us. We ordered the ricotta cheesecake. It had a very perky and tangy raspberry glaze and a hint of lemon zest. Not a bad combo. The texture was a little wrong, but mainly because I'm not the biggest fan of ricotta. Definitely worth the culinary venture, though.   I'd say Ilios can hold its weight in the Italian game. Very robust flavors, tons of items to choose from, generous portions....what else could you possibly ask for?   A great date night spot as well. If you find yourself in South Charlotte and looking for a sit-down Italian dinner, Ilios Noche should be #1 on your list.",

He provided great recommendations  and constantly checked in to make sure all was well. Their signature lamb dish was tender and full of flavor. Risotto is the best in the area, not the best I've had, but great.  The atmosphere was nice. Very modern and clean. The space is a little limited so you may want to make a reservation for prime time. Today is Friday, it was loud but there was live music in the bar area.",

    "text": "This review was submitted by my Mother! -I left myself signed in on her iPad. LOL  After seven years living in Charlotte and always looking for a place that cooks what they say is their specialty, again, the same problem that I've encountered in many other restaurants here in Charlotte, Ilios Noche lived to my personal observation, neither Greek nor Italian, from the appetizer Saganaki, -C, salad $7.50 very small and underdressed, then the entrees came, preparation and visual failed miserably, my husband ordered Moussaka, it was served cold, what a mess, the only thing Greek in that dish was the spelling, I made the mistake in ordering the Greek style pork ribs, wow, the seasoning was so minimal, no enough salt and pepper and a few oregano leaves, it should have been marinated in lemon, olive oil, plenty of garlic and oregano with grated Roma tomatoes and grilled and smothered with in their juice, served on a bed of rice/potatoes and roasted vegetables, no that thing they served me, the portion was enormous, who eat that much meat. I took it home, I have a dog that loves meat and not as informed in world cuisine.  In our way home I stopped in a store for while and when I got back to car the smell was so bad that I thought not even my dog was going to eat it, I was wrong, he is a dog and he ate it, I guess that was the only complimentary critique of this meal, and what I don't understand is, why don't they have salt and pepper shakers on the table, believe me, it may help, then, have their chefs travel, all expenses paid, to Greece for cooking lessons, and then, maybe then, they will deserve to get paid for what they are serving, just saying.....one star for ambience.",

Beautiful design, more spacious and the sound level for conversation is much better than the first styling. From the moment we walk in the reception is always welcoming. The bar area is striking and the bar staff is knowledgable, fun and great at wine selections. Then there's the food! These chef owners know how to put a menu together! P E R F E C T I O N!   The Greek and Italian recipes are delicious, interesting, fresh and always leave us wanting to try something new. To single out one dishing impossible... All are tremendous! The chef ownersnand partners do it RIGHT! Servers are knowledgable about the menu, are attentive & professional.  We are becoming regulars and feel this is THE place to enjoy weekdays and weekend dining! Drinks and apps at the bar for a happy hour or late evening is the thing to do as well.

    "text": "The place is nice, ambience is nice and if you are sitting at the bar to order food, service is just normal.  But to talk about the main thing which a restaurant sells - this place is below standard. Factors taken into account to rate the food - taste, presentation, authenticity, price. So this is supposedly a Greek, Mediterranean and Italian restaurant.  We ordered, a simple lamb pita, a chicken pita and zucchini and egg plant fried appetizers with tzazsiki. The appetizer had too much salt in it. The tzazsiki had garlic missing in it and the taste could've been anything from ranch to mayo to Greek yogurt - unfortunately it's not tzazsiki. The lamb in the lamb pita was dry, with none of the tzazsiki or garlic flavor in it. It was like using a week old lamb in a pita bread. It was the same problem with the chicken pita. Overall it wasn't Greek or Mediterranean food. Probably this may also come as a surprise to many of you that the food wasn't that good, because a lot of people (majority of people here) don't know what's good food , or rather what is authentic food. But of course they think they know, that's an even bigger problem. Nothing against anybody, but if I am going to a Greek, Mediterranean or Italian restaurant I will look for authenticity. Americanising cuisine isn't an excuse. I tasted better pitas from a food truck. So paying this much for this quality of food is undesirable. Oh yes I have tasted Greek food in Greece and Italian food in Italy, so I know what I am comparing with. I don't expect 100% authenticity, but it could've been at least a little better.",

    "text": "This is the most UNWELCOMING restaurant I have been to! First, the older woman that was a hostess just gave me a blank stare when I walked in like what do you want. I asked for a table and she walked me to a table with an attitude. Next, the waiter with a 'unique' looking mustache approached me also with a nasty attitude. He asked me what I wanted to drink and I told him water. He asked if I wanted lemon and I said no thank you. He brought my water with a huge piece of lemon. He hesitated as he was putting the water down realizing his mistake. He just placed the water down and NEVER returned to take my order. This was around 2:20pm on 6/19/18 and the side where I was sitting was practically empty! There were only two other tables being occupied. He walked past me like 3 times completely ignoring me. I saw him approaching the guests that were seated behind me asking if they needed anything but he completely refused to take my order. I decided to just leave. On my way out, I saw a petite woman that looked at me with a concerned look on her face. I asked if she worked there and she said yes. I told her I decided to leave since my waiter never came back to take my order. She apologized and offered to take my order herself. I told her no thank you because I needed to get back to work. I'm not sure if she was a manager or not. If she's not, she needs to be promoted and train the rest of the staff on the PROPER way to treat their customers!!  The waiter with the 'unique' mustache may need to be transitioned to the back away from the customers.",

I'm not sure what has happened here but it has gone downhill. My second visit was about six months ago. I sat at the bar and the manager and the owner stood at the opposite side of the bar watching noisy videos on their phone! I'll admit that it wasn't busy but really?? Today I sat at the bar again for lunch. The bartender was surly and acted like he had better things to do than wait on me (like disappear to the back and check his phone). The manager (I guess that's who she was) walked around the bar and said \"what the he**\" as she was  apparently frustrated about a phone call from a customer that she had to answer.  It seems as though the staff is just either burnt out or just doesn't care anymore. What a disappointment.",

It's always challenging to make everyone feel welcoming with a big group, especially on a Friday night when the restaurant is completely full, but the staff was great.  We ordered some specialty cocktails which were yummy and the wine list was well thought out and reasonably priced.  The appetizer plates they brought out were amazing, they were a section of their traditional mediterranean spreads. My entree, Livornese pasta with chicken, did not disappoint.  The bride and groom picked this place because they went here on their first date and now I can see why they still keep coming back. The only unfortunate thing was that I live in California and this restaurant is in North Caroline....ah well, I'll just have to plan another trip!",

    "text": "As far as kid-friendly spots for foodies go (yes, I think that is a legit niche) Ilios Noche stands alone in the Ballantyne-ish area.  (It isn't really Ballantyne ... it's more of the Providence Rd gateway to Union Co.)  It can be packed, and the crowd is quite a mix ... people on dates, groups of older couples and young families.  It can be a zoo at the wrong time ... and sometimes service is slow as a result.  But we haven't had a catastrophic miss in that department yet (I will admit to being someone who can get his undies in a twist when the service truly breaks down.)  Most of the time it is great ... and just as importantly we have never had a bad plate there with family or friends.  We love this type of cuisine and they have nailed it again and again.  Robust but not overwhleming flavors, fresh ingredients, etc.  Fair warning: if you fancy yourself a purist looking for *only* traditional Greek or *only* traditional Italian then Ilios Noche may seem off.  This is a take on nouveau-Greek-Italian, and in our experience it comes off very well.  Ilios Noche is run by the same folks who own Nolen Kitchen in the Myers Park area ... you can sense a similar mindful approach in the decor and the ingedients they use in the food.  We've been going here for years now and remain unabashed fans.",

    "text": "Five Stars because when a food establishment becomes an extension of family - the good kind of family that's there in times of celebration and challenge - I say they deserve nothing less!  With Spanish and Italian blood running through my veins, food that is thoughtfully and simply prepared with fresh ingredients is the only measure. Ilios is not about \"dining\" out in grand or ostentatious way.  Ilios is everything about eating a meal, being nourished with warmth and heart.  Seeing the line cooks chop away at their fresh ingredients in full view of patrons communicates to me every time that I'm about to be fed well. By people who care about what they do.  Have noshed on octopus, cerignola olives, delicate calamari, burrata tomato basil, and paper thin zucchini chips to my hearts content.  Have gobbled up unbeatable pork ribs, meatballs and house made sausage scraping up every last bit of of sauce with panzino or pita.  Have shared with my teenagers and their friends bowls of every creamy pasta and pizza on the menu.  Have even sipped take out hot lemon chicken soup when sick.  And return always with my husband and dearest friend to sit and be still and served with an ilios salad, skewers of lamb, scallops and trusty taste of all spreads, our glasses of wine in hand.  And week after week, month after month, year after year, NEVER grow tired of the little place in a shopping strip that has been so good to us.",

This last trip I tried the meatballs in red sauce and they were melt-in-your-mouth good. The dips are delicious. The moussaka takes a while but is worth it if you have the time. The zuchinni and eggplant chips are good but a bit greasy after the 8th or 10th one. We got the berry dessert and found the balsamic sauce to be a bit too strong; the basil ice cream was strangely tasty. The Ave Malbec was smooth and delicious. Note that the tables and bar are closely packed in. As other reviewers noted it could use a redesign (and a sunken or separated bar). Also, it gets very loud. Even after 8pm there often are rowdy young kids in the restaurant. Just be prepared for that if you are taking a date, and you may want to avoid weekends unless you eat late. Still the strong menu and service will keep us coming back. Oh and they have drink specials worth mentioning: Tues for wine, Wed for martinis, and Thurs for beer.",

    "text": "I was not impressed at all! First of all my father asked to have a Tanqueray and Tonic to drink and the waitress had to ask multiple times what that was then she responded by saying \"I'm not 21.\"Normally the waiter will bring out some bread to the table while you wait, NOPE not at this place....how thoughtful(do you sense my sarcasm?) We were a party of four and everyone in my party had their food brought to the table except me, and I ordered a salad.  After waiting for about 10 minutes my salad was finally brought to our table.  Don't you think salad would be the first thing that would have been made? After we received our food we had to wait for silverware to be brought to the table because at this restaurant they don't put the silverware on the table....some young boy bring you the silverware from the back with his bare hands. YUCK! I had ordered The Greek Country salad, well little did I know that meant it had NO lettuce/spinach at all....it was just cucumbers, tomatoes, and onions.  In the description on the menu it says \"hand picked vine ripe tomato.\"  I didn't know that it would be multiple tomatoes, it only said one! The whole salad was nothing but tomatoes! I must say for a place that has a somewhat nice atmosphere this place had nothing but teenagers as servers....this is not a local pizza parlor, they need to employ more experienced servers because these kids were walking around as if they were confused about everything.  Sad to say I won't be returning here.",

The staff is unbelievably knowledgeable and friendly. The food is amazing. We had the quinoa salad to start. Then the fig pizza and falafel platter to share. Make sure to ask for extra tzatziki sauce for the falafel. Otherwise it's perfect. I could eat here for lunch or dinner every day of the week and I'd still be ready to go back for more.",

They have vegetarian and vegan options. It's very clean and the staff were courteous, neatly dressed, and respectful. The food was delicious!!!! I can't wait until we go back.",

Our group of three had a reservation at 7 PM but we arrived early and were seated very pleasantly.  Our server was Lee and he was both very knowledgeable and outgoing.  He had a great sense of humor and spent a good amount of time going through menu selections for the one member of our party who was new to the establishment.  The restaurant quickly filled up and during the evening the server kept up with all of our needs as much as possible.  The only thing that was notable was that he forgot to bring a second drink but the moment he noticed, he apologized and went to the bar to get it.  The appetizers and the entree all arrived on time, piping hot and delicious.  The chefs there really know flavors and each entree had a unique spin.  There was also live entertainment.  A guitarist who was playing contemporary music, and he is quite talented.  The music is played at a level which still allows conversation at a comfortable level.  Lastly the bill for all three of us including drinks, appetizers and entrees was $75.00 not including tip.  We thought that was great and cannot wait to return very soon.",

Waiter said he wanted to wait for the Cosmo and then bring it together with the water. Waiter asked you want vodka in the Cosmo which I thought was odd. I asked if he was making the Cosmo and he said no. Said I prefer Grey Goose or Stoli. Waiter was definitely not on his A game today.  The server who brought food to the table were more interactive and attentive.   The falafel sandwich was good nicely wrapped in parchment paper and salad was fresh.  When we asked for check. Waiter had to double check with us with what we ordered.   Owners of this restaurant is the same as Big View Diner. Prefer wait staff and hostesses from the Big View Diner they are just the best.

I got the \"deconstructed\" lasagna which was basically a bowl of sauce and meat with square noodles and melted cheese.  Totally a pain in the a$$ to eat.  Not worth $17.  My girlfriend got some sort of tube pasta with a weird tasting bolognese sauce (under-sauced as well).  I dunno, the few interesting things on the menu were $20+ and if I wanted to spend that much on \"Italian\" I would have just gone to Portifinos/Carabbas.  I guess I was expecting some high end \"street food-ish\" fancy shaved lamb gyros or kebab sandwiches or something but I'm just not feeling Greek/Italian fine dining fusion.",

Our most recent visit was several weeks ago and I am still thinking about the excellent food and service we received.  As usual, we started with the calamari which comes with olives mixed in, which happens to be a very tasty inclusion. Since cocktails were only $5 on Wednesdays, we all started with the Detox #2, which includes vodka, grapefruit, coriander, bitters, and is absolutely delicious!  For my main, I got the pan seared flounder, which was amazing! I also felt the portion was generous and I was able to take a decent amount back home to enjoy the next day! My dinner companions were equally pleased with the lobster ravioli and octopus. I never had octopus before and thought it was seared well and perfectly seasoned!   As if the incredible food was not enough, we also had an amazing waiter, who was charming, attentive and made us feel right at home (I think his name was Dave).",

I was ok with that as trying new mixed drinks is a good thing to do anytime of the day!  I also had lunch.  Tried the meatballs, ribs and yogurt dip.  They were flavorful but could've used more heat as in they were warm.  The pita was great.  This restaurant was confusing as the menu is Greek and Italian.  They need to pick a side.  The seating is well appointed and the restaurant is beautifully decorated.  The manager was very professional and I was impressed with her style and how she delivered my food.  The wait staff was very professional as well and I will definitely visit again.",

We had a party of 6 with reservations, we cozier up to the bar to wait for our table, after waiting 30 minutes and watching everyone get seated and then the restaurant start to empty I went to the hostess and asked what the status of the our party was? She said oh we seated that group already, I said thats interesting since the reservation is in my name. Now to dinner, they served my wife's dish to another table and so she got to watch the rest of us eat while they cooked another lamb burger. Ok all of this is understandable if the operator acknowledges errors and does the right thing to fix the errors, comp drink, comp dessert, comp my wife's dinner or just have the manager come over and apologize. With that said food was really good and that will ultimately keep us coming back.",

Each time we decide to go back, I'm reminded of why I'm not a regular there. The food is mediocre at best, portions are small, prices are high. Service level inconsistent. We notified management via their website of our poor dining experience the last time we went. I received a message from a manager(?) apologizing profusely, telling me they would be out of town over the weekend but would definitely contact me again Monday. That was weeks ago...I'm still waiting.   We're done giving our business to Ilios Noche. Oddly enough, one of the best restaurants in the Ballantyne area for breakfast and desserts is their sister restaurant, Big View. Kudos to them...their management team obviously have it together. Ilios Noche...not so much.",

They have this Eggplant appetizer with walnuts, red onions and mint - super yum if you go in for that sort of thing. The chicken pita is a good staple , as well as the lamb burger. I always order a greek beer to go with it. They have at least two kinds in bottle. I always like to drink the beer that matches the cuisine, even though I'm pretty sure Greeks are not big beer drinkers.",

Employees seem timid around managers, once witnessed a manager berate an employee in front of customers. Don't staff enough on busy nights, managers give personal friends priority over people who actually have reservations (happened to us on Mother's Day). Food has gone downhill and just isn't worth the high prices. Spend your money at more worthy places like 131 Main. Won't be returning.",

    "text": "2.5 stars.  They're doing something right because the place was packed.  Glad we had reservations.  We actually tried to push back our reservation, but there were very few options other than a VERY late dinner.  Food:  Good, but nothing outstanding.  We ordered the goat cheese marinara app, which was tasty, but the goat cheese portion was smaller than the size of a ping pong ball.  Won't order this again.  I ordered the crazy lasagna, which is basically what standard lasagna would look like if you cut a brick out of a large pan and then dropped that brick into a bowl.  It's lasagna all mixed up and not neatly stacked.  The portion size was perfect, maybe even too much and I came ready to eat.  I enjoyed the dish, but it certainly wasn't memorable for its taste.  My wife ordered the veal marsala - she made similar comments.  Good but not great.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong dishes, because, like I wrote above, Ilios Noche was the place to be on Saturday night.    Service:  Our waiter was great when we saw him.  For most of the meal he was appropriately attentive, provided great input on the menu and wine list.  However, as our meal progressed, he became more and more non-existent.  Took a LONG time to get our check at the end of the meal.  I'll give him a pass since the place was so crowded - maybe he had more tables than he could handle, maybe he took a smoke break, etc.  Whatever.  Atmosphere:  I heard complaints about the tables being almost on top of each other so that they could cram more parties in at one time, but I didn't really notice that.  Additionally, we were sat at a two person booth.  Perfect for us.  This place is extremely loud, though.  I had a rough time hearing my wife from across the table and she's not exactly know as a soft speaker :)",

I set up reservations for 8:15p and when we arrived a few minutes early we were greeted with a beaming smile and sat immediately. Such an unexpected delight! We were then introduced to our server, Malia, who truly offered the most attentive, genuine and accommodating service to compliment a most exquisite cuisine. From the roasted red pepper spread and mushroom arancini to the kale/beet/goat cheese salad, our taste buds were alive and dancing in our mouths! Even their house made ginger beer was a hit. My husband, being a vegetarian, asked Malia to have the chef conjure up a creation of his own design. She happily took the request to the kitchen and they did not disappoint. As I savored the lobster ravioli, my husband devoured his custom made pappardelle concoction. We passed on dessert as our waist lines couldn't bear another inch, but we will certainly carry the memories of this evening with us and look forward to dining again.",

The bartender, a gentleman from New York, never once acknowledged me to begin with until I asked for a drink and subsequently ignored an empty glass of beer and water... Unless I asked.  Additionally, I ordered a half order of pasta and salad to go and waited for nearly 70 minutes for it to be ready!!!  The worst part.... Never once was I checked on, approached to discuss the delay, or even asked if I would like something while waiting.  Within a few months Waverly will open and later the development behind.  I hope Ilios has a plan to step up the game or they WILL go out of business in this location.  The food isn't that good, the prices are high, and the service is horrible!!!",

The first time was disappointing food and service wise. We had tried the vegetarian livornese pasta. The vegetables were over cooked, and the pasta itself was a soggy mess. Also had a Piemonte pizza, nothing special there. Service was slow, on what looked to be a not very busy night. Or server just seemed to disappear for long stretches. The second time here was much better. Our server was very attentive. The food was good too. The taste of spreads appetizers was delicious. I had lamb burger, which was perfectly cooked. My wife had a chief created vegetarian pasta of the menu. This time vegetables cooked and seasoned perfectly with just the right amount of sauce and cheese.  Dessert and drinks were okay.",

I will say the service was pretty decent but our food was some of the most bland we've ever had! I got the lobster ravioli which was extremely plain it barely tasted like anything at all and just wasn't good. I've honestly had frozen lean cuisine's that tasted better in all seriousness. My GFs food was barely any better than mine but still nothing special by any means. So $45 down the drain and we would've been better off going to the grocery store and picking stouffers or lean cuisines and saved $40. So save yourself the money and go to a better spot!!!",

I realize this was during the switch from lunch to dinner at 4:00pm but we had 3 different servers and none of them came back more than once to check on us. The food was amazing!!! I had the fig pizza and it was honestly one of the best pizzas I've ever had. My mom had the margarita pizza and she really liked it as well. We had the hummus appetizer with pita points and again that was very good. I just wish the service had not been that bad. My mom ran out of tea midway through her meal and nobody ever came back by to check on us. We literally had to flag an employee down to ask for our bill. Then the process of getting our leftovers boxed up and our bill paid took too long for the amount of customers they had. I will go back to try it again just because the food is wonderful but I sure do hope the service is better. To be continued....",

    "text": "We had a very nice lunch at Ilios Noche yesterday with our toddler in tow. It's hard to dine out with a one and a half year old and usually waitstaff just tolerate the situation, but our waitress yesterday (Angie) was absolutely wonderful! She brought him crayons, cone cups to use as a paper hat, and made him a paper airplane. It was so nice to have a waitress actually helping to make sure that our little one enjoyed himself too. Mind you she wasn't just doing this because he was screaming or anything like that. Our son dines out with us several times per week since he was born, so, he's actually really good at restaurants. No, she was just naturally very engaged with all three of us and genuinely wanted us to have a good dining experience.   The food at Ilios is actually really good - we've been eating Greek and Italian food for many years and have been to the Mediterranean more than a couple times. They're a bit heavy handed on the oils, but the ingredients are of a high quality and flavors blend together perfectly. The food here is craveable.  All of the staff members are friendly and service is prompt. Ilios would benefit from more light and air in the interior and ceiling fans in the outdoor seating area. That being said, I think you'll leave Ilios feeling satisfied overall.   We are certainly interested in returning to check out brunch and dinner!",

Usually it's at least 1 of the 3 that enjoy their dish but this was a first for ALL 3 of us to not enjoy our dish by no means. I'm talking downright Yuck, the flavor - the service - the options just all around.  The food was so horrible and unmemorable that I can't even tell you what we had. It wasn't picture worthy or anything. I am all about giving a place a fair chance so with that being said I will read through reviews and see what people are raving about and try one of those dishes and update my review if it is better than the experience we had as a family.   Every place deserves another chance and this place will be no different.  The 2 stars is for location THAT'S IT THAT'S ALL",

Delicious and spicy. I ordered capellini with scallops. Flavor was excellent but I was a tad bummed about only getting 2 scallops. He got crazy lasagna which was a rich and delicious deconstructed lasagna with papardelle. He also got a lamb skewer. I loathe lamb. I think it stinks and tastes like armpits but not this lamb. This was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I reluctantly tried a bite and was very surprised at its yummy-ness. We will be back again.",

While it's not advertised as a Greek restaurant, it's the only traditional/legit Greek place in town.  Appetizers Taste of all Spreads (Hummus, Tzatsiki and Greek eggplant dip) a phenomenal starter and very generous portions Grillled Sausage - the sausage and the sauce are ridiculously good and the foccacia they serve with it is perfect to help clean the plate. Lamb Souvlaki - melt in your mouth good - you can make a meal on appetizers alone.  Main Garganelli with Chicken and Crazy Lasagna are my favorite pasta dishes...though I have to admit that I lean toward the Greek stuff, so havn't ordered pasta here in awhile Moussaka - I don't like Moussaka but this has delicious, complex flavors and is enough for two. Lamb Shank/Lemon Chicken - when I'm in my Greek mode - both well done and remind me of my mom's cooking  Desserts Frank (on of the two Kaltsounis brothers) is a great pastry chef, and the Loukomades and Rice Pudding are both as good as you would get in Greece.  All-in, Ilios Noche does a great job...awesome wait staff....timiing of courses...etc. My negatives are the parking...and the fact that it's a mess getting there with all of the construction, but not their fault...and the fact that  the last two dates I've taken there have both been failures (it couldnt't have been the food...must've been the company) :-)",

Whoever designed this place deserves an award. From the banquettes to the gorgeous lighting fixture above the bar to the open plan kitchen - it all added up to feeling like we weren't anywhere near a strip mall.  I treated friends to dinner here after doing some research online. One wanted a unique salad, the other wanted greek food, and this place advertises itself as greek, mediterranean and italian. We went on a Sunday or Monday night (can't recall which). We started out with their homemade pita and hummus which was really good. My friend claimed the fresh baked bread smelled a bit better than it tasted, but I thought it was perfect.  Our server was awesome. He was very knowledgeable about all of the dishes - we had questions about the cheese served in my friend's salad. It was mild and looked a lot like mozzarella but was actually a greek cheese whose name I can't remember. It was very, very good.  My chicken dish was served in a slightly lemon flavored sauce, with fingerling potatoes. It was actually pretty amazing. The presentation was really impressive with every dish we ordered.  Also ordered were the seafood pasta (spicy!! and delicious) and the crazy lasagna (two words: veal bolognese). Both were excellent. The only complaint was not enough traditional Greek dishes. Still, we would all go back in a heartbeat - just wouldn't go hoping for a wide selection of lamb dishes.  Though we didn't order any, their drink selection was intriguing. There were some good wines, along with yummy sounding coffee concoctions and a mixed drink called Cointreauversial: a name which we dubbed the \"most clever\" seen in a long time.  They offer some good wine and martini specials on different weeknights. I will definitely be back for those nights when I'm in town again.",

The ambiance is upscale and elegant, yet perfectly comfortable.  We started with the dip sampler and the smoked eggplant dip blew my mind.  Seriously - I could have made an entire meal out of that and pita.  If I went back I'd pass on the hummus and tzatziki, as neither were anything special in comparison.  For dinner, I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried the Moussaka.  It was an enormous portion!  It was a great mix of savory flavors - eggplants, lamb, potato, and a rich cream.  The other person in my party ordered the Carolina flounder, and was disappointed that it was heavily fried fish.   The accompaniments were listed as artichokes, potatoes, and a compote, yet there was a single quarter sized piece of artichoke, far too many potatoes, and a dime-sized portion of raisin compote.  Despite one disappointing entree, I'd likely return in the future if I was in the area, though probably wouldn't make a special trip for a meal given the phenomenal Charlotte culinary scene.",

It doesn't stand out from the street, because it is in a strip mall next to Harris Teeter.   I went there because I was craving hummus and hoped to have some here, which I did for a starter! It came with pita bread, and it was pretty good. My spicy seafood pasta did not meet my expectations however, because it wasn't spicy one bit. The pasta was still tasty and filing though.   The server looked like he was just waiting to leave. Didn't feel welcomed by his service at all.   Would I go there again? Probably not unless I had a specific reason I had to go there.",

We ordered chicken nuggets and a pasta dish for my 2 yr old and 4 yr old grandchildren and they devoured all of it.  Our servers were attentive and friendly from the minute we walked in the door.  The meatball appetizer was utterly delicious and my favorite was their small serving of goat cheese in a tantalizing tomato sauce served with toasted/seasoned bread triangles (not pita). Yum!  My salad, greens with toasted pecans and feta was tossed with a delightfully light lemon vinaigrette.  I plan to dine here again when in Charlotte.",

Although other things look very good, I am very likely to have that every time I go.  Chocolate Torte was a great finish and they have a good wine and drink selection.

    "text": "Let's just say that Ilios Noche isn't all that \"great.\" I use these unnecessary quotation marks because it seems fitting for this place trying to be both a \"Greek\" restaurant and an \"Italian\" restaurant, and uses quotation marks indiscriminately across their menu (except where they are needed).   For instance, some of the sandwiches come with \"Greek fries\" (as written online), and on the menu, Greek \"fries.\" Needless to say I wasn't interested in sampling quasi-fries of any nationality. But, on the contrary, the Wood Grill section is not in quotes, although our waiter informed us, after we asked what wood was used in the grill, that there isn't really a wood grill at all. Yes, here was a legitimate opportunity to use quotation marks: \"Wood Grill.\"   I did very much appreciate our waiter's honesty and friendliness, and a waiter without much confidence in his place of work does speak volumes on its own.  But let me start at the beginning. Ilios Noche's al fresco dining is next to the Harris Teeter's supermarket parking lot, so you're really seated next to a mini van and souped-up BMW thoroughfare. Yes, there aren't many real estate options in this area, so this is unavoidable, but I think they should be more honest about the location on the web site for those to which this arrangement is...unexpected.  It was half-price martini night when we dined there, and that can potentially put a good spin on even the worst situations. I was blindly optimistic.  We shared the combo dip platter, which was not bad--four greek spreads with pita (red pepper and feta and the yogurt spread were the best, the hummus seemed made with dehydrated garbanzos). We also split the Grape and Fennel salad, which wasn't bad either: the right amount of dressing with shaved fresh fennel, grapes, spinach and unfortunately--cooked figs (think fig newton filling).   Despite my second martini, the entrees were barely edible. My friend had salmon that was cooked well but paired with some kind of salty faux \"tomato onion marinara,\" and my Spanakopita (not called this but that's what it was trying to be) was shaped like a curled up soft pretzel, heavy on the spinach and very very very light on the cheese. We also sampled the Gulf shrimp souvlaki, which should have been in quotes since there was no \"souvlaki\" anywhere in sight--just tough, slightly smelly shrimp on skewers that were left on the plate when we departed.  I was going to ask about dessert before the entrees came (perhaps that was the martini talking), but the cheque came before I could. I was considering espresso until the man at the table next to us asked the waiter about it and the waiter replied: \"Uh, our espresso machine...\" and the man completed the sentence: \"Sucks?\" Waiter: \"Uh, yeah.\"  Perhaps he should have used air quotes when saying \"espresso machine.\" Given that there really wasn't any wood grill, it's hard to believe there's any espresso machine at all.  I know there are not many options if you're staying or living around this area, so if you come here, revel in the large portions and stick to the very very \"Basic\" menu items. Oh, and drink some martinis with dinner. Or, as it were, more \"martinis.\"",

On our second time, we brought some family members with us. The menu was different. We ordered and the food was tasteless. It would have been fine if this was an $8 meal, but each plate was over $25. The server was nice and efficient,  but too fast.   The meal was over $350, not counting the tip. What a waste of time and money! We would have gotten better service and a tastier meal anywhere else.   I'm not going back. There are plenty of excellent restaurants in Charlotte. This is not one of them.",

Sat at the bar with Erin serving up a great Lemon Drop Martini, consistently attentive, even after she got slammed with a suddenly full bar. Even better, other servers stepped in and helped, like it was second nature. Impressive team work! I had the lamb chops with risotto parmigiana. The lollipop cut chops were cooked to perfection and seasoned just enough to taste the sweet, tender meat. I asked for cheesy risotto that also came cooked to perfection! One friend had the brussel sprouts, which were sweet with a savory finish. Another friend had their deconstructed lasagna and OMG! A great balance of ingredients atop al dente pappardelle. The woman spotting the food before it left the kitchen was very diligent, plus she was the first to come backup the bar when it got slammed. A great dining experience at Ilios tonight!  FYI.... 1/2$ draft beer Mondays, 1/2 $ bottles of wine Tuesdays, 1/2 $ Martinis Wednesday and music Th, Fr & Sat.",

    "text": "I have to start this review by stating that the food at Ilios Noche is very good.  But our meal this evening was somewhat disappointing.  Perhaps we should have known that many restaurants like this one use prix fixe menus in holidays like Mother's Day.  But a prepared menu with no vegetarian options?  Somewhat disappointing.  And I also believe that this is the sort of thing you should note very clearly on your website to ensure that customers are not surprised (which they did not).  Secondly, service was decidedly subpar.  Whole we saw plenty of the other wait staff, our waiter was conspicuously absent for most of the meal, and when he did appear, was not especially responsive.  Both coffee and tea required two asks and over 15 minutes to deliver.  And the family that was seated after us editors the restaurant well before us... and not because we are not slow eaters!  Total meal time was almost 90 minutes, which for our family is unusual.  But the food?  Tremendous.  I had the salmon filet over delectable white beans, while other had lobster ravioli, veggie primavera and mozzarella flatbread.  The kale salad was absolutely delicious, as was everything else we tried.  Dessert was the best part of the meal - amazing cheesecake and flourless chocolate cake - both were truly excellent.  Overall, I'm hoping this was a holiday fluke, and that our next visit will be an improvement!",

The servers station hovered above this table. Asked to be moved and instead of just moving us, hostess \"had to check\". As a past server myself, just move the guests and make changes at the hostess stand.  While our server, once she came to our tables after at least 10 mins, was sweet, there were 2 other tables seated after we had waited about 5 mins. It would have been nice if she had taken our order, put it in system, made sure our cocktails were on the way and then take other tables order. Don't take multiple orders at once!  Waited 15 mins for cocktails, had to ask another server to check on them. Once we got them, mine was fine, husbands missing requested fruit. Don't get Saganaki, not hot or flaming. Looking for a nice dining experience. Not here, no tablecloths more like Denny's without Moons over my Hammy!  Off our list. Things that could have made a great experience were free.",

Service has been slowly slipping over the past few months, but this last experience was the worst of all. We sat at a high table at the bar. Waited 25 minutes for menus and water. The poor bartender was overwhelmed, and no servers helped her. Our cocktails took far too long to come out, and there was more ice than anything else. I specifically asked for my appetizer to be brought out with my friends entree, but no such luck. My food was served 20 minutes before my friends food was served and was cold by the time her meal arrived. It took forever to flag down a check, and the bar was crowded with kids dropping plates, parents not watching their children, and unsatisfied customers waiting for food and service. There are far too many restaurants in the Ballantyne area, Ilios will no longer be one of our choices.",

I called days ahead and reserved a table which was in a nice quiet area towards the back and all the hostesses I talked to were so sweet. Service was phenomenal- wish I could remember waiters name! Lots of drink refills, plates cleared quickly, etc. Food was great. We got lots of shared appetizers for the table and everything was delicious and came out hot and fresh. Some stand outs were the antipasto plate, pork ribs, spinach pie, souvlaki skewers, mushroom rice balls...I could go on we basically got everything! The baklava sundae for dessert was amazing. The kids menu was cheap and had a variety of items- no crayons or anything for them to do, so bring your own :-). Only complaint I had was not being able to order a half glass of wine- I didn't want another whole glass after my first (apparently the waiter asked and the bartender said no? So I didn't order another but at most places they'd rather have the money for a half glass than refuse a customer - so I thought that was odd). Otherwise a fun and yummy dining experience- thank you we will be back!",

    "text": "Two stars says it all. This place is my least favorite of this restaurants groups three restaurants in Charlotte...Nolen Kitchen, Big View Diner, and this one.   We began our experience by waiting 1 hour in the bar area, literally throwing 'bows in an effort to maintain control over some semblance of personal space at the horribly conceived bar area. There was only one seat available, so being the gentleman that I am, I gave it to my wife and stood behind her. I'm pretty sure the two-top table 6.5 inches behind me were THRILLED at having a front row movie theater view of my butt while they attempted to enjoy dinner. Did I mention we had reservations, and still had this kind of wait? Unreal.   We continued our up-close-and-personal adventure with the rest of the restaurants patrons when we were finally seated at a table for two...5 inches from tables situated to the left and right. Remember that scene in \"Valentines Day\" (that god awful Ashton Kutcher RoCo), the scene where people are sat so close together they accidentally grab other peoples water glasses? Picture that, and you have a good idea of what this restaurant has to offer. I kid you not, we did actually end up having a conversation with the couple seated to our left, since we figured that was better than jockeying for position in the restaurant through sheer volume. Impromptu family-style dining, my wife and I joked later.   The food was OK, and the service was ok...especially considering how slammed this place was, and how the wait staff could hardly maneuver between the restaurants patrons, all packed like sardines. For my money, Greek Isles in Southend is a far better Greek and Mediterranean experience than this place. Their dishes may not be as creative as Ilios, but I feel like they provide a more intimate and authentic experience...definitely more bang for your buck.   I have to say, I was pretty disappointed with this place, especially considering how much I like Nolen Kitchen and the Big View Diner. This place has very little concern for customers comfort and overall experience, but judging from the poor table layout and double and triple booking reservations, they seem to place alot of concern over squeezing every single penny they can out of their little strip mall location.   VERDICT: Won't be returning.  EDITORIAL NOTE:  I hate it when people give a place 5 stars and then rave on and on about their hummus and pita bread.  Yes yes...this place makes great hummus...so does my 4 year old niece who I'm teaching to cook.  Come on people, its garbanzo beans and olive oil.  You can't mess it up.",

    "text": "Once upon a time I took golf lessons at Providence Country Club, which was really an expensive excuse to go to Ilios Noche each time for lunch afterwards.  Every time I'd have the salmon sandwich, perfectly grilled medium rare and juicy and perfectly seasoned with salt and cracked black pepper with red pepper glaze, arugula, tomato and cucumber... it melts in your mouth and is on perfectly toasted bread. It's making my mouth water as I write. If you want to go extra decadent, add on a huge piece of gooey honey laden baklava and it will send you to the moon!    So why not 5 stars? Well the dinner- it gets ultra crowded, and the tables are quite close together and you never like to eat while the vultures (people waiting for tables) hover glaring at you to scoff quickly.  Also some of the entrees are good, but not \"send you to the moon\" salmon sandwichy fantastico.  I do remember the scallops being very good. That said, even though Nolen Kitchen is way closer to me, I think Ilios Noche has much better food.  Too bad it's like  8 hours away. Slight hyperbole.  We'd be regulars if it was closer and larger though. Yum.  The environment with the open kitchen is cute neighborhoody trattoria. Well done, Stratos!  PS I have had them cater a few things and they did a great job!!",

I had the crazy lasagna, plenty there but for me just ok. Still love their Ilios salad. My wife had a cucumber and tomato salad with grilled chicken. Their chicken is very good. Topped it off with a peach cannoli, excellent.",

The shopping center is desolate now that HT has moved on and the recent health score card (87.5) hanging on the wall when you come in serves to reinforce that this restaurant's glory days are behind it.   Waiter was not knowledgeable on the drink menu, missed the obvious lack of silverware on the table upon our arrival and really was fighting to just be present.   Our app of bruschetta was mediocre and the cheese was almost the consistency of still wet Elmer's Glue.   The main course of \"Crazy Lasagna\" wasn't bad tasting, but looked like a bizarre combination of Hamburger Helper and wet dog food.   Cocktail was worthy. Smoky rye and a flavorful spice helped rescue the second star.   Disappointing. After 5-6 in the ladtI think this was our last visit sadly.",

I asked for a side of pita bread.  They brought a plate of toasted pita tips, which were served with the best butter ever.  I put the sliced chicken on top of the pita bread.  Very yummy!  Great atmosphere.  Service was not quite perfect, but it was okay.  I think this restaurant needs servers who exude the same level of style and class as the restaurant. All in all, a great restaurant experience.  And yes, I will be back for the fig pizza.",

Maybe that will come in time.  We like having lunch here, especially as a late lunch to avoid the business crowd.  Menu is excellent, even has a build your own section.  Basically this is two sides and a \"main.\"  Yes, they have pizza, pita sandwiches, some pasta entrees and a soup of the day.  And the bar is the star as they do good cocktails, manage to accommodate wine preferences and are a friendly bunch of bar tenders.  Appetizers are a good way to feel you way through their Greek and Italian offerings.  Wife is non-seafood, so she likes the eggplant and just LOVES the chicken-lemon soup.  Avgolemono is the Greek name for it, so don't panic when you see the \"A\" word.  It is excellent and can be a great lunch on its own.  I like the octopus, which is cooked but served cold, drizzled with olive oil and over a bit of green stuff.  The calamari is also good.  Dolmades we both like, cold or heated.  Prices are OK and parking is in the big shopping center, so no problem.  Dinner has more stuff to choose from.  And they also offer sides of good things that could be appetizers or mains.  Appetizers are also an expanded category.  More pasta options, entrees are broken down by type of meat (seafood, poultry and, well...meat).  Food is good. Menu is great.  The fly-in-the-ointment is the inconsistent service.  We have had wait people with an attitude while others are superb.  The kitchen generally manages to keep up; but not always.  If it is a busy lunch, especially, or a crowded dinner, there will be delays.  An elusive management challenge for sure.  Tell management on the spot.  The wait person will storm around and REALLY have an attitude, so time your critique for after the meal.  Although I do not want anything compt'd, the manager generally is very apologetic.  My preference is to fix the problem, rather than to pay customers for the inconvenience.  That just allows the problem to continue and there have been some wait person loo-loos.  Maybe that is why we don't go back regularly?  It is a good place to eat.  Give it a try.  Sorry to report on the inconsistent service.",

(<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iliosnoche.com%2Fassets%2Flunch-new-2.9.19-prov.pdf&s=c3d97c59b1e649b558b44dd846697c2868b9b6f54bfba16deb7101b59b251d25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">iliosnoche.com/assets/lu...</a>) Both salads were very tasty and complemented the spinach pie. I hope to go back and try another lunch soon.",

The interior is cozy with a large bar area and high top tables.  Tuesdays offer half price bottles of wine so we enjoyed that option! We had the hummus spreads with pita chips and zucchini chips-everything was delicious.  I also had the Aphrodite cocktail which was very good.  I look forward to visiting again and trying some other menu options.",

    "text": "My husband and I returned to Ilios Noche, as we do nearly every year, to celebrate our anniversary last night. Having honeymooned in Greece, Ilios Noche for many years was the closest we found in Charlotte to the food we ate there.  We were sat promptly for our 6:45 reservation. We called ahead to inquire about corkage fees, and found that there is no corkage fee for the first bottle of wine you bring to Ilios Noche, and a $15 fee for every bottle thereafter. For us, and our one bottle of wine that we have saved since 2007 to drink, it was a great deal!  Erika was our server, and she was fantastic at her job. We didn't want for anything. The food was spectacular. I ordered the Greek style pork ribs, and my husband ordered a lamb dish with orzo. The pork ribs were perfectly cooked, and easily eaten with a fork. Very tender, smoky and lightly flavored. We also ordered a sampler of all the dips (htipiti, hummus, tzatziki and an eggplant dip) as an appetizer. They brought us multiple pita bread refills until we'd conquered the appetizer, for which we were very appreciative!  Everything about our meal was perfect. I've been looking forward to the leftover ribs for lunch all morning!  Ilios Noche is expanding in a couple of weeks which hopefully helps with the space concerns noted in other reviews. Erika told us they hope to stay open through Mother's Day, doing construction on \"the other side\" of the soon-to-come-down wall in order to minimize their downtime. The sign at the restaurant said they're expecting to host a grand re-opening in June.  I highly recommend Ilios Noche, and learning about the free corkage on the first bottle of wine last night really puts them up there on places I'd recommend in Charlotte.",

    "text": "With restaurant week in full force, we wanted to avoid the Queens Feast frenzy and enjoy an excellent meal.  Now, I have been pushing to dine here for some time now.  We were able to secure an 8:00 p.m. reservation (which is pushing it for my dad who starts asking \"What's for dinner?\" at 3:00 p.m.)  Needless to say, we were all famished when we arrived to be seated.  We waited for over an hour.  Actually we went and got a drink at Hickory Tavern next door to avoid stealing food from nearby tables.  Finally, after just over an hour, we were seated, and livid.  The manager TOTALLY saved our night with a round of drinks, and three delicious appetizers on the house.  The 4 dips (omg walnut and eggplant!), saganaki, and short ribs.  The short ribs are to DIE for!!    For my meal, I ordered the striped bass, which comes with capers and is very lemony and fresh tasting.  I ordered the broccolini as my side which was fantastic.  I highly recommend the beef short rib entree with butternut squash puree, which was on special that night. The definition of savory.  The moussaka was also excellent, unlike any moussaka I've ever tried.  We were too stuffed to try any dessert, but it is a must for next time.   Thankfully, the owner informed us that he is expanding the space.  Hopefully to avoid hour long waits for diners who have reservations!  The owner was genuine and very apologetic and made up for it so much that we can't wait to go back.  Delicious and eclectic food. YUM!",

Our favorites are the calamari, the red pepper dip, zucchini and eggplant chips, Greek fries, lasagna, harvester pizza and chickpea salad. The spinach pie is incredible, too. I love ordering a salad with spinach pie on the side. The staff is so nice and really accommodating when we bring our little boy with us. The hostesses always seat us at a table where we'd be comfortable and have enough room for the high chair and, sometimes, stroller. Tuesday is half off bottles of wine and they have a good selection, although I do wish they'd include the reserve wines since half off of what the restaurant charges is the markup if I were to buy the bottle at a shop myself. We like to take out of town guests here and they always enjoy it.",

    "text": "We love us some Greek food.  Craving some gyros, we headed to Ilios Noche last weekend to get a good dinner and a few glasses of wine. We were really excited based on all of the awards they had won in the last year.  The menu looks incredible - especially the appetizer selection. We were very excited to order.  We approached the hostess stand and asked to be seated, the phone rang and she proceeded to leave us standing there while she took down a to-go order.... meanwhile, I'm trying to balance on crutches with an air-cast on my leg. She later apologized, which was nice of her, so we just let that go. Whatever.  We ordered the baked feta, and it came to us completely cold. Maybe it was supposed to be served that way, but that isn't what we were expecting.  My husband had half a glass of cab left in his glass, and the server walked by and poured some of our bottle of malbec in his glass, wasting what was left of the cab and a bit of our malbec.   I was very surprised to see that there were no actual gyros on the menu. They have a similar thing but it comes with marinated cubes of lamb, which was kind of a bummer, but it didn't actually say \"gyro\" on the menu, so we can't complain.  My husband also asked for a few things to go with his salad that never came.  The final verdict: We weren't impressed by the service,  but we might come back and try other menu items. They have a great wine list (try the Malbec!), lots of food choices, and some of the food descriptions sounded amazing. Just don't come if you're craving gyros, there aren't any.",

    "text": "Ilios Noches is my favorite of the tri-fecta (Nolen, Ilios and Big View Diner) because everything I've tried here is fresh, well made and the happy hour (mezze menu)  ROCKS!   For $5 you can choose from a HUGE list of appetizers and mini-versions of dishes.  Wine is $5 too.   Spreads are $3.50 each during this time, and I truly recommend them all.  the Roasted Eggplant with toasted walnuts and red onion and mint is delish-- the Roasted Red Pepper which features aged feta and olive oil are two of my favorites. Get the cucumber yogurt tzatziki, but just know you'll get a side of it with other menu items, so you may end up with too much. (These spreads come with super soft pita...NOMMMM.)  Some of the standouts (AKA I'd order these again) include the trio of Mini Cheese Pies.  These are little bite-size flaky, crispy filo wrapped cheese delights that are salty and crunchy and utterly delicious. The burrata and saganaki too is fantastic...heck, all their cheeses are!  The shrimp, chicken and lamb souvlaki are good staples, served with that tzatziki and pita. The pork ribs are savory and tender.  All the salads are fresh and well composed too.    As for the pizzas, I've never had them, and would like to try next time I go for dinner.  Some of the pastas are just...good, nothing special, like the spahgetini.  It almost makes me think the menu is too big and only the stars should remain.   Desserts. This needs to get it's own section.  There's a berry dessert I MUST get no matter what. It's this portion of fresh berries, drizzled with this sweet balsamic glaze and served with BASIL ICE CREAM! I even asked for what kind of balsamic they use, and bought a bottle of it for myself!   Ilios would get the full 5 stars if a few of their menu items were omitted, or executed a bit better. (The lamb pie, which is great on concept, my husband is Greek and his family makes AWESOME lamb pie...but this one has thick dough surrounding it, and it was still a bit raw in places.)",

You will NOT want to share the cheese, just sayin. So, Frank ordered the ribs that came with a slaw. They had an odd flavor that can almost be confused with being off. But, we think it was the herbs, probably coriander that we're not used to. They were cooked perfectly. Tender and meaty with a nice amount of fat that made the mouth feel very unctuous. The flavor was actually very good, just not what we're used to.  The slaw was ok, nothing special. We order the lemon potatoes on the side with Parmesan. Fuckin delicious. They were crispy and creamy inside with that nice tang of lemon and nuttiness of the parmesan. So good.Oh, and I almost forgot the HONEYBALLS, OR Lucamadis as theyre called. Very different from Aunt Lena's honeyballs or Struffoli, which I make TO DIE FOR, BTW.  These were big, not used to that. But, they were so light and fluffy with nuts sprinkled  on top and honey, which I asked for more off. Really good. Youu have to get those. Overall, I liked it a lot. I wont go back with Frank, but I will go back with my friends. It was delicous.  OPA!!!!",

    "text": "I have bookmarked Ilios Noches for some time and why I waited so long to come is beyond me. The location is way off the beaten path for most people especially when most of my dining takes around 77 interstate line. It was well worth the discovery process. I have been to some of their other sister locations and I have always been pleased.   Esthetics:  Those who don't initially judge by location, decor and layout, are not True diners (my opinion). I certainly don't mind a good hole in the wall but my passion for design and a well laid out restaurant is always in the back of my mind. The location is small and it's in a strip mall, don't judge. You walk in and its very tasteful with an open kitchen design behind the bar. It's modern, casual appeal is there and it makes it comfortable. It's not super fancy by any means but it's a nice spot. I am very curious about their newer location closer to Southpark because their outdoor seating is supposed to be a lot nicer, and more of a lounge.   Service:  The moment you walk in you are greeted by very friendly hostesses. You don't get the \"I am too good to be a hostess\" feel you get way too often when you are in Southpark or Uptown. I sat at the bar because my intention was not to have a full on dinner (which is what ended up happening). My service attendant at the bar was very knowledgeable in the wines offered and did it with a smile. Truly was a pleasure to have had nice service given that I was sitting at the bar. Sometimes you get missed by an overwhelmed bar tenders providing service to both those sitting in the main dining and the bar but that wasn't a feeling nor the experience I had.   Last but not least....FOOD:  Greek food is one of my favorite cuisines. Greek food is light, fresh and on the healthier side than most ethnic cuisine. However so is Italian which is what they also claim to be. I give my opinion on food but ethnic food in particular on a \"main dish\" that the restaurant should be known well for given the country/region. Greek chicken and lemon potatoes is a staple. How do I grade them? Sadly, I give them a B- and not because it wasn't tasty but because it honestly didn't taste authentic. The chicken was tender and juicy, that was for sure but it lacked the signature  fresh spices, primarily oregano and lemon... really???. The potatoes didn't even have that fresh lemon taste. I wouldn't order it again but only because I am still curious enough to try other things on the menu. My friend had the crazy lasagna, it was tasty and it come with a very nice herb bread.   I will say that their trio of humus was phenomenal! Talk about flavor and freshness. It composed of Roasted eggplant aka Melitzanosalata, Roasted red pepper aka Htipiti and your traditional chickpea humus aka Revithiasalata, all of which was nicely presented with yummy triangles of pita bread.  All this said I would suggest this to people to try out. They have a great contemporary wine list and half priced bottles on Tuesdays.  I want to give them another go but like I mentioned earlier, I want to try out the other location to compare.   Kali oreksi.....translation, Bon Appetit!",

But bottom line, it's about the food.  I went for lunch with my neighborhood friends.  Ordered the Mediterranean Cobb salad with no special edits.  Keep in mind this salad is $13.50.  Portion, small.  Lettuce?  Cheapest on the planet...iceberg.  Tomatoes?  One cherry tomato cut in half.  Seriously?  ONE?  Grilled shrimp was the best part.  Missing?  Olives and prosciutto.  I'm telling the neighborhood ladies to pick a different place next time.  To be fair, I have been here for dinner 3 times as well.  First one was great, second two were a waste of considerable money.  I'm done with Ilios Noche.",

My daughter and her boyfriend were going their on a satty hawkins date (she's 15).  My wife and I also went separate to grab a bite at the bar and pay for their meal. We had made reservations for them and they were seated promptly. They had a Great time and were treated like gold..Thanks you so much Ilios Noche. Sometimes teen at nice restaurant dont really get the deserved service.  There was a full bar so my wife and I ordered some wine to enjoy in the seating area. We put our name in and were told the wait could be up to 2 hrs...it is what it is at nice restaurants on a Sat. night. I asked for the manager \"Patrick\" to let him know we would be taking care of my daughters bill. He laughed and thought the whole thing was cute. To our delight he was able to get us seated fairly quickly and NOT next to my daughters table. The whole experience was perfect...my daughter and her boyfriend had a Great time...we had a Great meal with first class sevice...AND once again I appreciate that Ilios and the team helped to accommodate our family...What a Rock Star of a manager!! We will certainly be back and would reccomend this restaurant to anyone.  The atmosphere is wonderful and the food terriffic. I will say that the thing that put us over the Top was the way the staff made us feel like REAL Guests!  Thanks again.",

I sat down at the bar to order a glass of wine and asked the bartender for a recommendation for a red blend. One recommended was nice, so I asked for a pour.  All was fine, except for one of the plates that we shared was so salty that we couldn't eat it.  We enjoyed out visit with each other and decided to end the night.  Then the bill came and I was shocked to see a $60 charge for 3 glasses of wine!  When I questioned the very young barkeep about the charge, all she did was smile.  Funny the bartender who recommended the wine didn't come over to answer my questions.  Shame on me for not checking out the prices of wine when they were recommended to me.  Shame on the bartender to recommend one of the most expensive glasses of wine they carry without being upfront and honest, not giving me a heads up the price.  A good bartender is trusted by their customers and gives all the information they need to make a decision.  Although I went ahead and paid the bill because of course I drank the wine, I won't go back since I felt completely taken advantage of!",

The staff there are consistently friendly and appearance is professional. I'd rate them very high, a solid 4 or higher.   I have an issue with management. We've dined here seven times, mostly lunches but a couple of dinners. One three occasions I've actually witnessed management berating their staff, using expletives and gestures that drew much attention from customers. Later I found out that it was the manager and the owner on another occasion.   Perhaps in Greece (owner) or France (manager) you can get away with that type of belligerent behavior but this is America. Not only that, it's the South!  Watch your back.",

I am not here to knock Ilios Noche, I just didn't have a great experience with my meal.  I ordered the Atlantic Salmon and requested the dish done with a slight sear on the outside.  When the food finally came, the portion was the size of my iPhone, not the best sight I've ever seen but hey it is what it is.  When I tasted the salmon it was definitely crunchy and overcooked.  Also, the taste profile of the dish was not to my liking and needless I wasn't pleased. I've read other reviews and there seems to be a consensus on the quality, decor and waitstaff.  So I'll check this off as my bad, however I don't see myself returning for a mediocre experience.",

Other people at the table were drooling over my entree, so I guess that I made a good choice.

Their Facebook page, Open Table reservations and Google search page all said they opened at 11:00 a.m. on Sunday, but their website and the brunch menu on their website said 10:00 a.m.  We got there at 10 a.m. on Sunday, and the hours on the outside of the restaurant said they opened at 11:00.  We called from the parking lot to ask what time they really opened, and it took the girl who answered a few minutes to confirm that they did, in fact, open at 10:00.  No wonder we were the only people in there!    Besides that bit of confusion, the breakfast was great.  I loved the new decor; it looks completely different!  The reds, oranges and browns/grays made it feel much cozier than before.  We both got the Ilios breakfast, but I got scrambled eggs and bacon whereas fella got over-well eggs and grilled sausage.  The sausage was almost like a brat - thick and a little spicy.  He loved it, but it was just a smidgen spicy for me for breakfast (but I'm a wimp).  He also loved the fresh-squeezed orange juice.  Talk about going above and beyond!  The breakfast potatoes were out of this world with onions, peppers and garlic.  The panzino toast was uneventful; some jam would've helped, but it was pretty bland on its own.  Ilios Noche is a little out of the way for us, but after we got home I read that another location is opening in Quail Corners this spring, which will be much closer to us.  I (and my stomach) can't wait!",

    "text": "Would give them negative stars if I could.  Have been coming here for a decade and always enjoyed the food.  Tried to take my parents in town from Oklahoma to enjoy a super early dinner (5:15pm) on a Friday night but were turned away.  We were greeted without a smile - \"do you have a reservation?\".  I scanned the huge dining area to see maybe 12 folks seated of their just about 300 person dining capacity.  \"No, we do not but hoping you can fit us in\".  After 2 other ladies joined the stand and conferred, I was told the wait would be 30 to 45 minutes because they are completely booked up and just waiting on people to show.  Not offered a seat at the bar to wait.  Just a good ol' fashioned No.  I asked why 30 minutes since I doubted all the people about to show up would be cleared out in 20 minutes or less?  Why not just let us sit at one of those tables that are kept back by the bathroom for just in case situations...or as a hedge assuming one of the 60 (give or take) tables that apparently were fully reserved would not show up...she was super confused and told me \"I dunno\".  My message to the fantastic restaurant manager at Ilios Noche off Providence - You lost a very long time patron due to the absolute easiest thing to get right.  Your food is amazing, wait staff is always on, wine list is well put together and very reasonable, but....the folks at the front of the house were both cold and irrational.  Good luck.",

    "text": "Yum and Yey!!! I think I've found my spot!! Since visiting for the first time back in February, I have been back about 8 times, making Ilios Noche my go to lunch meeting, afternoon cocktail, night time boo time spot!  The atmosphere is nice, service is consistent, drinks are tasty and the food is delicious.  I've tried almost all of the small plates and all were pretty tasty.  The zucchini and eggplant chips are my fave followed by the four spreads and the saganaki which is a strange cheese dish is oddly delicious, odd because ive never tasted anything like it but delicious nonetheless.  I was not impressed by the pork ribs and found them to be a bit bland.  The angry shrimp however were yummy.  Falafel was fried to perfection and good.  I can't wait to try the octopus... Probably on my next visit.  My favorite salad is the Ilios to which I've added a delicious lamb skewer.  The flatbread with arugula and fig is a winner and you can't go wrong with the Lamb shank.  Have I convinced you yet that I'm a fan?!  If not maybe the Brazilian dude who is crooning live on Saturday nights will.  He is amazing!  Oh but there's more!  They have drink specials... Wednesday cocktails are half price.  Have the Ardrey pear and thank me later.  My husband usually gets a smokey on the rye which has a pretty cool presentation if you are into fancy cocktails.  My only negative thing about this place is that it can get a bit pricey if you like to try a bit of everything like me but who fault is that?  Also the service can get a little spotty during busy times.  Ooooh I almost forgot about the heavenly apple crisp dessert!!! SO GOOOOD and a nice shareable size. trust me when I say this place is a south Charlotte gem!",

    "text": "I've just eaten at this restaurant for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised by the amazing food this place has.   When I first entered the place I was overwhelmed by the amount of loud wine-drunk people packed into a relatively small space. My girlfriend and dad were with me, and being a few of the only people there strictly to try the food, the obnoxiously drunk table next to us left a pretty bad first impression. This is to be expected on a Friday night, though, so we huddled together in conversation while we read the menu.   My girlfriend and I love Mediterranean food so we had the anxious pleasure of having to pick one meal out of so many great options. We ended up picking the same thing for once and were not disappointed.  The waiter brought out some amazing bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar which was definitely not the cheap stuff. We contemplated just eating round after round of that for dinner but we had already ordered entrees so we might as well eat those too.  For dinner we both had the Livornese. The ingredients (including the pasta) were fresh and the flavor was incredible. Sometimes something is so good that my girlfriend and I end up staring at each other shaking our heads in agreement and then proceed to grunt and moan shamelessly while slowly eating. This was one of those times.The table next to us didn't seem to mind after all. We were in awe with no regrets.  Go eat here, it's amazing.  Although I would like to try this place when they are least busy. If anyone who works there is reading this, when are you the least busy?",

Then did a 3 side platter of risotto, mushrooms and cabbage olive salad which I loved! Lemon and olive oil cabbage with a few calamata olive slices was so light and fresh. The risotto was cooked to perfection, creamy but not overpowering and buttery. The mushrooms were one of my favorites really enjoyed the reduction they'd sauteed them in. Finally they gave me a sample of cream of spinach and Greek lemon soups. Lemon is in everything I cook and drink so you know which one I chose but the spinach was creamy but not heavy and would have made a great lunch choice all on its own. Overall - 5 stars! Loved the inside of the place too and there is seating outside. Classy, clean, warm I can't wait to come back!",

    "text": "I had a date on Saturday night with my best girlfriend who I rarely get to see since she lives in Charlotte and I live in Arizona.  We headed to Ilios Noche as she speaks highly of their food and recent renovation... We should have known the place would be packed when we couldn't find a parking space nearby, but we bit the bullet and parked a tad bit further and ran in through the pouring rain.    We had a short wait, but the hostesses were friendly and we were greeted by Stratos himself (of Stratos Restaurant Group who also has Big View Diner and Nolen Kitchen in his portfolio of restaurants).  We entertained ourselves by catching up, people-watching, and then finally, looking at the menu as we prepared for our order.  (The menu is huge by the way, so it was hard for us to narrow down what we wanted... everything sounded amazing from the appetizers , soups, salads, and sandwiches to the entrees , pizzas, pastas, and sides).  We were seated at a table in the back after waiting just over 30 minutes or so... and we immediately ordered drinks and a \"Traditional Greek Spreads\" tasting plate, \"Pikilia.\"  It came out pretty fast (along with whole wheat pita) and we dove right in... I highly recommend all of the spreads, but the Roasted Red Pepper spread was our fave!  For our meals, I went with the Greek Country Salad and added lamb and Sloan went for the Capellini & Diver Scallops.  We shared two sides as well: Charred Asparagus and Greek \"Fries.\"  Everything was delicious although I will warn you that if you order the Greek Country Salad, be prepared for lots of red onion!  Service was pretty spot on.  Our waiter checked in with us often and refilled our drinks before they got too low.  He also replaced the cocktail napkins several times - gotta love that attention!  There was also a fun, happening vibe in the restaurant yet it wasn't too loud to have an intimate conversation either...  If I lived in Charlotte, I'd definitely make Ilios Noche a regular in my lunch/dinner rotation, and I can't wait to try Big View Diner and Nolen Kitchen on future visits as well.",

The veal piccata melted in your mouth, the lamb shanks were cooked to perfection , and the capellini pasta served with scallops and prosciutto was something I would order and I don't love to get pasta out. I ordered the pork ribs which were the biggest portion and came out steaming hot, falling off the bone...and that seasoning! I also can't get enough of the Greek fries they serve with many of the entrees, including the ribs.   Somehow, we saved room for a few bites of dessert: the Baklava is to die for with figs, cinnamon, and some vanilla-caramel ice cream.

    "text": "I discovered Ilios Noche on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.opentable.com&s=398d735bf96cffe64a6a11b3d7f0c486215cac974c6f01ddf01041ea38c97fa1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a>, as I was looking for someplace new we could go on a Saturday night.  I've never been south of I-485 on Providence Road, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect or where it would be located.  I reserved a table for two to give it a try.    We found the restaurant in the first shopping plaza we came to, behind all the road construction.  We were amazed at how crowded the restaurant was (and relieved that we had made a reservation in advance -- thank you, Open Table!).  We were seated within a couple of minutes.  My first observation of the restaurant is that it could easily be expanded for the amount of people that were there.  Right now, it's kind of small, and it would be nice to have some separation between the dining area and the bar area.  The bar could easily be expanded, too, as it makes the perfect waiting area (there really isn't one).  There is outdoor seating, too, which is great, but it's along the parking lot with no separation either, so it doesn't lend itself to be a fun area for dining.  There's also an area for take-out in the restaurant that surprising continously had a long line.  Wow!  They do a great take-out business apparently.  Unfortunately, the take-out line had to compete with the dining area, bar area, and open kitchen area, too.    Now...onto the food.  We sampled a few appetizers/tapas to start, but you could easily make a meal out of sharing a bunch of these.  There are SO many from which to choose.  They have five different Greek spreads to order with pita pieces.  We sampled the Roasted Red Pepper \"Htipiti.\"  It was amazing.  Roasted red pepper with feta cheese?  YUM.  It was so creamy, too.  We also sampled the olive dish and the spicy calamari appetizer.  The calamari wasn't coated or fried; it was sauteed and smothered in a spicy almost-marinara sauce which, incidentally was too spicy for my partner, but -- loving spicy foods -- I found it to be \"just right.\"    Since I normally only eat lamb in a gyro at the Greek Festival here in Charlotte, I ordered the Lamb Souvlaki pita wrap for my entree.  The sandwich offered chunks of lamb (instead of slices) and had a lot of flavor to it.  I even ordered some extra tzatziki sauce (the only way I like to eat cucumbers) to dip my \"Greek fries\" into.    For being so incredibly busy, our server did a fantastic job, even though she apologized over and over for delays and waits that were nonexistent or weren't that bad.  It didn't help, though, that we witnessed the restaurant owner (acting as food expediter) barking at every server.  That was kind of off-putting and unnecessary, considering the servers all seemed to be working very hard and keeping up with how crazy-busy it was.  Plus -- hello! -- they're human beings.  Treat them like some.  Being a former server, I can only imagine what they say about him behind his back.    I used the restroom before we left and felt like I had stepped into a different restaurant.  The hallway leading to the restrooms wasn't maintained very well and neither was the men's restroom itself.  I was surprised considering how well the rest of the restaurant appeared.  I felt like I was walking into an \"employees only\" area that they weren't as concerned with.    Having ordered so much food, I took some baklava to go.  I got a huge piece for $7.  I sampled some of it and it was delicious.  It definitely competes with the baklava I usually love to get at the Greek Fest.  It's very moist (which I love) and full of sweet flavors.  Kudos on a great baklava!   All in all, I think Ilios Noche was an excellent find and we're very glad we went.  Would we return?  You bet.  I'd love to try many other things from their extensive menu.  And I'll definitely make a reservation to ensure a very short wait time again!",
