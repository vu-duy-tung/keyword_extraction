The greens  tasted like they just pulled it out fresh water . There was absolute  no salt or any spices added.  The potatoe salad was actually  the best thing . I wouldn't  waste my money here ever again.",

And it's really nice  when we were leaving they all said good bye.  Very refreshing to have such a pleasant experience.  We get used to mediocre service and forget about what it's like to have proper hospitality.  The menu is standard meat and two veggies, pintos, lima, collards, mac & cheese, potato salad, mashed potatoes.  Roll or cornbread.  Sweet tea. Ten dollar check average.",

Rich and Cheesy baked with Egg (I think), this is the best one I have tasted ANYWHERE!   The Collards were very good at least 4 yelp stars probably cooked with some kind of meat and Vinegar!  The Fried Okra was better than most I have eaten - the batter was thin, though more grainy than I prefer, still beats most places!  The Corn Bread was: Smooth and a little Sweet, just like I like it (NOT having that grainy cornmeal texture) - the flavor was good or a little better than good, though a little disappointing! Still good enough for 3.65 yelp stars!   I ate Lunch here yesterday 5-14-2012 and they had not moved yet!  They said hopefully a week!  I drove by their new place first (in the brand NEW Family Dollar Shopping Center almost across the street and a little North (up the hill) on Tryon).  This new space they are almost in looks great: Clean and New and larger - Hopefully it will retain the Charm of the old place!",

The mac & cheese were hearty and delicious - they added something (egg?) to give it some chunkiness, so its not just mac with drippy nacho cheese.  The green beans were just ok, but that was fixed with some Texas Pete's hot sauce.  The cornbread was good but small.  Prices are around $10 per plate.  Don't let the 'hood intimidate you - the folks are friendly and welcoming, although a bit slow on the service.  Its a no-frills kind of place - just tables, stackable chairs, styrofoam cups & plates, and plastic utensils.  Most of the locals get the food to go.  They proudly display their Steve Harvey Hoodie award and a signed pic of Juvenile on the wall, so you know its the realness.  And if you don't know, you better ask somebody!",

Now I will admit that that probably was an accurate wait time for all of that fried food but I was ready to eat !!! Chicken wings were fried really well ( A light batter that was not hard ) but lacked seasoning, I consider them southern style but not soul food style because they tasted average.  There Wasn't a Particular seasoning that stuck out and made the chicken soulful. On the flipside, at least the chicken was not too salty. Their Side item serving sizes are  what the typical restaurant gives you.   My roll reminded me of the Hawaiian bread but without the sweetness. It was Warmed and thick but definitely not anything different from what you can buy a grocery store.  It was not particularly bad but the food did not stand out for me. The cashier was very flat and could work on her professionalism. The restaurant is clean and has ample parking. Maybe I'll give them another try in a few weeks.",

Always upbeat and friendly. i have had 2 bad experiences here. 1 time i ordered a chicken salad and i couldnt enjoy it because i just did not care for their house seasoning and the chicken was heavily dressed in it before they fried it. The 2nd time i ordered a fish sandwich and i was extremely disappointed I think it was a whiting sandwich and i expected 2 crispy fried pieces of fish  or 1 peice of fish cut in half. What i got was some miscellaneous bits of fish that were limp and under cooked. The fish was not opaque and i was very upset that i got uncooked fish in these strange pieces. They were literally like all broken up and halfway assembled on the sandwich. some were the size of a quarter, some pieces were the size of a potato chip, i could go on but this puzzle piece fish sandwich fell short and i think its clear.   But it's not all bad. At this point i am not against going to lawans but i wont pay for their lame buffet with like 5 menu items or dinner plates or desserts which can be like $4 for 1 piece of cake. I only get porkchops. lol a porkchop lunch special or a porkchop sandwich. everything else is a no from me dawg....",

Pork chops, chicken fried steak and catfish! And collard greens! We ordered way too much food but just had to try the livers, gizzards, pork chops and catfish. It did not disappoint! Everything was seasoned perfectly and the portions are GENEROUS.  We were the only ones dining in around 7pm for dinner but they had a constant stream of take-out customers. They have a buffet at lunch. You won't leave hungry.  We think folks in North Carolina are some of the friendliest people on earth... and at La'Wans they make you feel right at home. We had the sweetest server who was so attentive. And towards the end of dinner, the owner came and introduced himself with and handshake and a huge smile.  We can't wait to return to Charlotte... we will come back to La'Wans!",

Brought sides for fried shrimp, but no shrimp or cornbread. Finally shrimp arrived. No cornbread. Had to yell at waiter about it. Sides for grilled shrimp, greens were cold. Waiter brought a lil extra. They said our order of fried shrimp was given to another cuatomer by mistake. But they we're holding rest of our order to try to serve together.

She said portions were small and I didn't see that at all here.  My fried shrimp came with at least 10 shrimp. The collards were plentiful as well as the mac n cheese.    The shrimp were a decent size and the coating had a bit of spice to it.  The collards were wonderful but i disagree with Rod O.  I thought the mac n cheese was just average here.    What really shined here was the service.  Everyone, and I do mean Everyone was friendly and happy to answer any questions or requests.  They made sure you left with a smile.",

And the serving size was plenty! I had the fried pork chops with mac'n'cheese, collard greens, and corn bread. A real Southern meal. It was the first time I've had collard greens and I don't regret it one bit. It was great and I'm glad I tried it. I also had the chicken tenders with the Honey Mustard sauce. Wow. The tenders were real fresh and not processed and fake like you find sometimes. And the honey mustard sauce was the best I've ever had. I honestly couldn't have asked for a better experience and I'm glad I didn't let some of these negative reviews sway my decision to try this place out. The food was great and so was the service. If you want some good home cooking, this is it. I wish I could have tried those salmon cakes, but maybe next time!",

    "text": "Went there for their buffet and was extremely disappointed, this is the worst buffet I have ever had. For the price that they charge ($17.99, soft drinks not included), there was very little to choose from on the buffet.  The turkey wings were very dry, the stew beef was too salty and there was no gravy for the rice we had to add some from the stew beef. The collard green were loaded with sugar and spicy hot. There wasn't even a soup to choose from. My husband and I asked for bread because there was none on the buffet and they brought us one roll and one corn muffin.  We later had to ask for more bread and again one for each of us was brought over. Now the dessert bar, all I can say is really, it was all store brought cake and cookies. They're calling this a soul food restaurant and serving store brought desserts. We were presented with the check and realized that there was a charge on there for the extra bread. Are they serious? A $20 buffet and you're charged for extra bread. Since when do you offer a buffet and no bread?  When I inquired about it they did us a favor and took one roll off. Well I guess you can gather from this post that I will never ever eat there again. I wanted to give them a lower rating but one is the lowest. They lucked out!",

One thing that empress me more than the food was the service and the people working there. My little boy is 4 1/2 years old and Autistic. I turned my head and he ran up to our waiter at another table and hugged him. I explained he does that sometimes and when paying up front, everyone behind the counter ask for a hug and talked to him.

Food was ready in about ten or fifteen minutes, fried chicken wasn't heavy on the flour, making it very edible. Husband approved of the gizzards and wanted to get some more for dinner. Beens and potatoes were good. Collards were sweeter than typical but yum. Coleslaw had a bit more tang than usual mayo-based and was chopped. All in all, delish meal for less than $20.

    "text": "La'wan's was my introduction to real southern soul food. It was great and is still great. They offer seven different daily specials that come with two side and a drink. In addition to the daily specials, there are weekly specials by the day of the week, that are also accompanied by two sides and a drink.   Mac n' cheese like I've never had on the west coast. (hence my intro to soul food) It isn't just a straight creamy mac, but it still has chunks of cheese and is quite stiff, greasy and oh so tasty. They also offer other traditional southernsides; collard greens, black eyed peas, applesauce (for pork chops), green beans, etc. Gizzards and Fried livers too.   Fried chicken here isn't traditional. They use like an herb \"shake n bake\" esque type batter, then fried. Quite tasty nonetheless.   For those of you who haven't been here, I guess I'll let the secret out.  This establishment has won many \"hoodie awards\" given out by the Steve Harvey morning show. It is very eclectic with a wide range of customers  ranging from suits and ties to everyday laborers.   La'wans is one of my bi-weekly lunch options and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates good home style cooking.  --WARNING-- Do not get the smothered pork chops for lunch. You will be comatose! You have been warned. ;)",

He was bopping his head while talking and talking really inappropriate to a customer, telling me that he gave me my change. So at that time the boss comes back with my change in hand, and stated that camera showed that he didn't give me change back...So I stated that he owes me an apology for talking reckless....the cashier refused! As I explained to her that I will not patronize a black owned business like this due to fact that its ignorant people like him make it hard for businesses to succeed because word of mouth travels fast....I DONT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT.....Better off going to House of Prayer!!!!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "BEST ARNOLD PALMER OF MY LIFE!  small joint with everything fried and all the home fixin's you could ask for. We sat down and dined in, very low key/casual. The wait for the actual food was hard to bear but totally worth it once it came out.  We went right at noon and were the first ones in the place, which was a good thing because it got pretty full a few moments later. Many people also came into grab 'to go' orders so the staff was definitely busy in the back!  My brother got - Fried Pork Chops with green beans / fried okra  **If I were to redo my food, I'd get THAT! the green beans were unimaginably good, cooked with pork/bacon. Fried okra, hadn't had it in forever so it was AMAZING  I got  Fried Chicken (dark meat) with mac/cheese and collard greens. The collard greens were a bit sweet, my brother said it was the best collard greens he had ever had (and he's not even a big fan of collard greens!). The mac and cheese was baked (just the way I like it with baked cheese on top). The chicken, delightful, but can't say it was anything CRAZY GOOD.  My friend got the fried catfish with fried okra and mashed potatoes. The catfish was fried to perfection and the inside was still very moist. Forgive me, but I think I decided I'm not the biggest catfish fan but his was still delicious! I unfortunately did not try the mashed potatoes, but I'm sure they were fabulous!  Every dish came with a small cornbread, which was perfectly moist and buttery. Again, I love the salty cornbread more so this was a little sweet for my liking, but it was still amazing.  In the end for our three meals, it came to about $37 and then add tip, so NOT BAD AT ALL. We were FILLED to the brim and with DELICIOUS FOOD AT THAT.  Can't wait to go back when I get back home! And next time I'm going to try to save some room for dessert, many of the 'to go' orders had mounds of cake slices and they looked friggin' delicious!  La'wan, so glad I found y'all! :)",

I was told 20 minutes...they took longer. I ended up having less than 10 minutes to inhale the food, with them only being 5 minutes away from my job. It was nasty. I ordered a shrimp and fish combo plate (about $17) with 2 sides. My fish was plain, I had 4 cold shrimp, my mac & cheese was swimming in oil and the greens was okay (might have been the cause of the toilet visits the next day). I ended up forcing the mac and cheese down my throat so that I could finish my 12 hours shift. I kept the remaining part of the plate and took it back the next day. I spoke to a gentlemen who was okay with refunding my money until he opened the tray. He asked me where the mac and cheese was? I explained to him I ate it in hunger but it was disgusting. Due to it being missing he then told me that he could only refund half my tray....it was $17 bucks and because I could only eat the mac and cheese you want to deny me a full refund...uhhh okay...the logic being??? Then got the nerve to ask when did I come in...around 8-9 pm his response was \"well I was cooking then, I fixed this tray, it wasn't nasty\" and you know this how? Did you taste my food? And because you were cooking do you think you can't produce nasty food? Since then I have not been back, completely upset at the audacity of this man. To be honest I've heard a lot of complaints since they have moved across the street. Go back to the hot box and lower your prices, because you got ridiculous and nasty once you crossed the street!!!",

The catfish was alright and I say that because I am not a fan of having it battered only on corn meal.  The greens were fine but needed salt and who ever plated them could have drained the juice off. I had no complaints on the mac and cheese and I am very picky when it comes to that. Oh, and the sweet tea was on point. Our server came to check on us regularly and was friendly.",

The takeout service (not from the restaurant) delivered on time at 9:45pm, it's  now 10:15pm and as I write this the entire order except for the cornbread is in the trash, I'm not sure if its a late night quality issue, or what I ordered, but this meal was inedible, so bad I didn't even ask for my money back because I can't imagine anyone who delivered a meal like that would give a damn about what a customer thinks.",

One of my coworkers, a white girl, was a bit nervous about going at first. I guess she thought I was taking her to the hood. But I told her that there's a mix of people who go here. When we arrived she was completely comfortable and thoroughly enjoyed the meal. I typically get the buffet. It pretty much always has Fried Fish, Fried Chicken, Mac&Cheese & Collard Greens on it which is ALL I NEED!! Sooooo delicious!!! When i'm not at the buffet i'll get the fried Pork Chops. OMG! Just like your momma made them!! Everything is actually. The cornbread is just OK tho. I can normally pass on the cornbread/roll. The servers are always really nice and i've never had a super long wait here. You definitely can't go wrong here!",

First of all the positives: 1) the inside was clean and spacious; 2) lunch specials are about $7.99 including 2 sides, drink and bread, which is not a bad deal. I think the buffet is priced at $9.99 for weekdays but I didn't check out the offerings as I am generally not a fan for buffets.   We ordered from the lunch specials. I had the fried whiting fish with green bean and cabbage:  fish was underwhelming, cabbage too salty. Husband had the fried pork chop with mashed potato and rice: pork chop was overcooked and dry. He actually ordered rice and bean but got white rice instead.   Service was kind of disorganized. Our waitress never made it back to our table after she took our orders though she didn't seem too busy as far as I could tell. It was another employee who seemed to be there overseeing things brought our food and got our drink refills once. When we finished our meal and went to check out, our waitress couldn't find our bill in their system: somehow someone else paid our bill so they had to ring it up again.   Don't think we would be back.",

The only thing was that the food took awhile to come out.  Seems like a lot of people get take out. I wasn't too thrilled that the workers didn't ask me if I wanted a refill on my drink and I had to go up and get it myself. It probably took 30 mins to get the food. Kind of crazy if you think about it since all I got was fried chicken. But based off of the fried chicken and just that I am definitely a fan.   This place puts Roscoes to shame. We in Los Angeles are so deprived of good soul food.",

The food has always been hit or miss but I must admit that despite all of my hit and miss encounters the macaroni and cheese has always been the best that I've had in Charlotte which is the reason I would return after not so great encounters. However as much as I like to support small locally owned businesses, my last encounter was my finally visit to LaWans. I order baked chicken, not only was it undercooked but it was bloody. This was not noticeable until I started to eat the chicken.  I understand that mistakes do happen so before posting on Yelp, I attempted to reach out to the owner/management; months later and still no response. I can not continue to support a business whether small and locally owned or not if the owners/managers of the business do not value customer service.",

I paid $28.00 for chicken with rolls and even though I thought that was pretty pricy I figured for that price the chicken would be on point.  I was soooo wrong!!!!  This is the worst chicken I've ever had, had me wait 20 min for the chicken so I thought it would be fresh. I was wrong again, chicken was room temperature and had been sitting out so long that the meat was so dried out I couldn't even chew it. And they did not give me the chicken I asked for, no wings and thiee were breast meat instead of thighs.  I basically paid almost $30.00 for some bread rolls because that was the only thing edible.  I was really hungry so I tried to find pieces of chicken that were chewable, I maybe had 5 bites of their chicken that were chewable out of the 10 pieces I bought. The next day my stomach was feeling kinda off, almost a week later my stomach is still a mess. I would have been better off with kfc or even Gass station chicken, I'm not sure how this place is staying in business. I had food from this place years back when I use to live on that side of town and they had good wings, candied yams and greens, really good!  Alots changed in those few years unfortunately   I called while still in the parking lot and complained about the chicken being nasty and she had someone call me about 20 min later after I was just pulling up at my house to tell me I could return the chicken for fresh chicken or get a refund but I did not wanna waist anymore of my time being it was going on 9pm.  If they would have just gave me fresh chicken from the start?  No one was even eating in that restaurant when we waited 20 min for the order of old dried out chicken.  Don't waist your time or money",

So I had to give it the highest rating I could because my meal was awesome!   I had the fried porkchop, fried okra and Mac and cheese....and it almost made me forget for a moment I wasn't at home sitting at the dining room table after my mom made Sunday dinner! Mmmmmm!!!!   The fried porkchop was crispy with delicious flavor in the seasoning, the meat was juicy and tender and it came out HOT....yummy! I've reviewed the fried okra before but trust me even if you're not a fan of okra you will love it here...the breading they use to coat it and the  freshness of the okra will have you secretly admitting that you actually have been an okra fan all your life!  And now to that mac and cheese....YUMMY! Perfect amount of cheese, pasta and flavor, I loved every bite! And again it came out hot and fresh! Add a piece of corn bread and a drink and for less than $10 you get one of the most filling and scrumptious meals you can imagine!  There is NO doubt that I will be back to enjoy this place again!",

It looks to be an ordinary cafeteria.  But the food is extremely tasty and a great value.    They even cater to my biggest pet peeve - the bathrooms are spotlessly clean as is the rest of the restaurant.    They have a side room that seats 30 people easily for a corporate lunch.  I noticed on the wall there was  a plaque submitted to them by BAM - Blacks @ Microsoft commemorating a donation drive they held there.  How cool is that?

    "text": "Now , let's keep in mind it's tough to judge a good southern soul food meal , depending on where you grew up in the south , taste will vary .   La Wan's is on the top of the list for delicious soul food , our waiter was extremely funny and on top of his game . My coworker and I went at 11:30 not too early not wrapped up in the hectic lunch crowd .   I noticed the buffet , at $9.99, it appeared to be a good deal, small salad bar, fried chicken, collards, green beans, Mac & cheese ,  smothered chicken , rice , etc. It's not your extravagant buffet , but it's the classic dishes . I ordered off the large menu , there were many options even \"Healthier \" food dishes like grilled chicken tenders , broiled shrimp , grilled tilapia, etc . , but I ordered the fried wings with a side of collards and Mac & cheese .  The wings were seasoned simple, just enough seasoning to satisfy your fried chicken cravings , what I loved is that they weren't heavily breaded. The Mac and cheese was delicious, it was your basic baked macaroni and cheese . The collards , I loved , normally I put vinegar on mine , but I don't feel La Wan's needed it , they were cooked just right with the right amount of flavor .   I will definitely go back and try the grilled food options, can't say I've had better soul food from the other places I've visited in Charlotte, nice to find a place that  delivered that  soul food experience .",

Don't know if he'll remember what he verbally agreed upon the next time I come in but the gesture was greatly appreciated.   Food was absolutely AMAZING though. Four stars because the service is just as important as the taste.  Went back a second time and ordered the chitterlings. Really nice taste. Clean, seasoned just right, it came with white rice and I got doubled collards this time and it came with a really nice buttered piece of cornbread that was SO yummy!",

    "text": "I hate I did not have any pictures to capture the experience.   Service - 3 Food - 5 Price - 5 Portions - 5 Interior - 4  Service earned the rating because the waiter assumed I called the restaurant 'ghetto.' It was literally the first thing he said before asking what would I like to order. I was pretty annoyed by the first impression because he made an assumption when I hadn't even mustered a word to him. The service improved by the end of dinner. However, it's a lasting impression.  Otherwise, the food certainly earned 5 stars! I haven't had good quality soul food cooking in Charlotte until this restaurant. I have heard of a few to try; however, this one did not make the list and I wish it would.   You certainly get bang for your buck! I'm not a fan of the buffet bar; however, if re-order cabbage and BBQ turkey ribs everyday from this place if I lived nearby.",

While the ordering situation was initially confusing... do I seat myself? do I order at the counter? ... it straightened out quickly. Yes, seat yourself. Yes, someone will bring a menu and take your drink order. There's also a buffet table, but I skipped that today.  A few minutes later, I had a quarter of white meat chicken set down in front of me. The chicken was really excellent. Lots of meat, not a lot of batter, not too greasy at all. The mac & cheese lived up to the sign out front (\"Best in the Queen City\") with lots of cheesiness inside and a good topping of toasted cheese. Maybe not as good as *my* mac & cheese, but certainly some of the best that I've had away from my own kitchen. The cole slaw had the right consistency and texture, but I found the pickle relish taste to be overpowering. No worries, to each his own.  Service was excellent. My water was refilled as needed, I was checked on as needed and there was a squeezy bottle of Texas Pete on the table for some bite.  Really good chicken and great service. Yum!",

    "text": "No, this isn't the place to satisfy your craving for orange chicken.  It is, however, simply southern; exactly as advertised.  La'Wan's offers a small buffet and a full menu.  Fried chicken, fried shrimp, fried tilapia, fried catfish.  Notice a theme here?  The typical southern soul sides include collard greens, green beans, mashed potatoes, mac-n-cheese...the list goes on.    I stopped in for a late lunch.  The place wasn't too busy, but I imagine I missed the bulk of the lunch crowd.  The service was lacking.  I waited longer than I should've to place my order, and it took entirely too long to receive my food.  Had I been there during the lunch rush, I'd likely have walked out before ever receiving my meal.  My order consisted of fried salt and pepper catfish, fried shrimp, green beans, and mac-n-cheese.  The mac-n-cheese was good, but I've had better.  The green beans were simply prepared with no seasoning whatsoever.  The shrimp were perfect, and the cocktail sauce was amazing!  I'm not sure if it's made in-house or not, but it had just the right kick!  The catfish was rather bland.  It could have used more of the salt and pepper that the menu boasted.  The tarter sauce was dill heavy.  Again, I'm not sure if the sauce was prepared in-house.  Both sauces were served in pre-portioned togo ramekins; which makes me think it's an in-house job.  Once the waitress finally reappeared, I asked what they had to offer for dessert options.  She had already dropped my check by the table and made no attempt to up-sell me on anything else.  I decided to give the banana pudding a go.  It was plopped in front of me in a plastic togo container that came straight from the fridge.  It was banana-ful, but the wafers were mushy and it was too cold.  Just removing the lid made a mess of the whipped topping.  The waitress never came back after that.  Another employee (possibly a manager/owner) came by and grabbed my check and credit card.  It's the kind of place where you would usually take the check up to the counter to pay, but they offered to go ahead and run my card for me since they saw it out on the table.  Overall, I think this place does southern fried soul fairly well.  I'd go back if I were taking someone else with me that I knew would enjoy that type of food.  My goto would be the shrimp for sure.  As for it becoming a regular stop, probably not.  It was far from a 5 star dining experience, and it's a little to artery clogging for my taste.",

I however have a real problem with the quality of service and how incredibly slow service is...I call after 4pm, and was asked to hold..I waited 15 minutes and yet no one acknowledged my call, I then arrived to an empty lobby, I assumed it had to be VERY busy, not at all. I excitedly ordered my food, and was told I had to wait an additional 20 minutes. To the ownership: Do you read your comments? How do you address issues like this? I'm literally sitting in your lobby, watching your employee get laid for standing still, why I look at your dirty dining room, the 1 other table that is seated, the server has not once offered them anything or asked if I needed a beverage while I waited. Hire your employees that you can train, a smile and apology goes a lo6way in this business. I mentioned to the server, about me waiting 15 minutes on the phone and yet to be acknowledged, she said \"oh we only have 2 people server\"...My Goodness. What could be so good, I rather stand in line at others establishments knowing I'll be greeted with a smile. Creating a culture is important to the success of your business...Closed your doors, appreciate your employees and teach them how a smile is success!!!",

The Smothered Chicken was SUFFOCATED in a sad excuse for gravy that was watery and tasteless. I don't know where they get their chicken, because it is the scrawniest, boniest birds I've ever had .

While driving around, La'Wan's was the closest spot so I figured I'd give it a try. The chicken itself deserves 4.5 stars. Been a while since I had fried chicken that good. Well seasoned, flaky breading and a juicy taste when you sank your teeth in. Two thumbs up. I also tried their fried catfish and that was pretty good as well.  The sides were sorta hit or miss. Nothing terrible but nothing that stood out. I did enjoy their mac and cheese but who messes up mac and cheese? Service is a little slower than I'm accustomed to but after four pieces of chicken and a slew of sides, I wanted to be left alone anyway. Perhaps that's the point.",

There is no reason a fish dinner should come with two pieces of fish. So not worth the money. I could understand if it was mahi mahi or swordfish but whiting. Geez. The side dishes were ok. Nothing to write home about! The cornbread was hard as a boulder.  A waste of money and time for a \"taste of southern soul food\".",

I just needed something that was fried and wholesome and made me feel like I stopped by my Gma's house, ya know! After ordering, I was seated at a small table, perfect for just me.  Tydrika was my server and she was just so welcoming and friendly. We talked for a bit about some writing I was working on and she made me feel at home.  It didn't take too long for my food to come out so I was happy about that. I tore it up! I had some hot sauce that I sprinkled on my chops and that was all she wrote! I'm glad I took a moment to take a picture because it vanished shortly after. The service was wonderful and I'm looking forward to going back!",

His plate was looking all full, tasty and plentiful while I had all that space on my plate lol (I heard that's a healthy look). The ONE piece of grouper was seasoned and fried very well but that's all I really enjoyed. The greens were a little bitter and the yams mushy but the price was ok. I can't say that I'll return here but it seems to be a popular place where many locals visit and take out.  I don't have much more to say because I didn't have much on my plate to review lol.

It came with two sides so I got fried okra and rice & beans and an extra side of collard greens. It came with corn bread (and honey). The food was very tasty and the staff was very friendly. I was stuffed and the prices are VERY reasonable. The only drawback is that they are not open a little later. They close at 9 which is reasonable but I often work late and it would be nice to be able to pick up dinner.",

Not being from Charlotte, I didn't know what t expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. I will come back. If I had one criticism, it was hard to cut the pork chops with plastic ware...real silverware for dine in, please...",

If you're looking for some good soul food I would choose Nana' s over this over priced store front restaurant. My veggie plate was $7.88 with just 3 vegetables,  cabbage, mac cheese fried okra. I didn't get anything to drink with this..Now granted the food was hot and the taste was ok...but it was nothing different from other soul food restaurants. Next time I want a veggie plate I'll go to  the Roasting Company can get 4 veggies for 5.59 and its prepared healthier... I don't know how they came up with their outrageous price points for that little bit of food they give.  But this is typical for some AA businesses.",

The service was immediate and attentive. They have a buffet and a menu from which to order. I chose the buffet because I wanted some vegetables. Although the food tasted fine, the buffet is very limited in choices: salad, cabbage, fried chicken and a couple of other choices. This would have been OK except that they charged over $9.00 for it. If I go back, I should probably choose from the menu.",

I ordered fried fish (Croaker which is $3 more than whiting) with no sides or drink and the total was about $7.50. Service wasn't expedient but not awful. After navigating a physical fight in the parking lot that included LaWan employees, I drove 30 mins to my home and it was then that I discovered ONE piece of fish in my container -- a piece of fish that was smaller than the palm of my hands -- which are fairly small -- minus the tail and fins. I called the restaurant to confirm what I was charged for and apparently ONE piece of SMALL fish will set you back about $7 bucks. The taste was decent but needless to say I will not return to this establishment or refer anyone else. There are just too many other options.",
