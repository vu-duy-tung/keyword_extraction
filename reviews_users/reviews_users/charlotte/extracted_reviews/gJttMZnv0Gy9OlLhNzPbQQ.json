    "text": "Great brunch/breakfast.  Hip interior and music.  The food is tasty with creative paring of ingredients.  The bacon is amazing- nothing like what you buy or get at most resturants.  Meaty and mildly salty.  Loved it so much I ordered some to go.  Great granny smith apple juice.  The only item I didn't like we're the meatballs. .which were extremely dry.  They lose a star for service because on the occasions all my waiters were not good.  Forgetfull, snobby, not friendly.  My last visit they brought me the wrong juice- and instead of admitting the mistake- the waiter insults my intelligence by saying \"well its organic - so we can't guarantee taste\".  Do fresh juice about every week so I know apples from grapefruit. Smh",

    "text": "Unfortunately the mixed reviews are correct. I wanted to try this place for myself to see if the experience would be good, but sadly I have more negative things that only add to two stars.   Service = no good. Our waitress took a long time and then was not helpful. I asked about a breakfast egg and cheese sandwich menu item that said it is served on a roll. Could you tell me more about the roll I asked. \"It's just a roll, and toasted.\"  Since I didn't have a back up item, I decided to go with that. I proceeded to get a hamburger bun for my breakfast sandwich. Are you kidding me!  Also on the service, yes the iPad at the table payment is awkward having to tip bad service right there.   Location/ambiance = more negative than positive. It was really hot inside and we were sweating. Unfortunately I am not exaggerating. We couldn't get out quick enough. The parking situation is very tough to get in and out of there. The decor was really nice visually I have to say. Unfortunately the chairs were very uncomfortable and the coffee mugs were completely unacceptable. No handles and you burn your hands.   Overall. For the price, you should skip Little Spoon.",

The (mostly)Good: I had the chicken biscuits, and they were delicious! Just an absolutely home run, but for $12 it wasn't enough food. The server was very nice and attentive.   The not so good: 2 people in our group order the 'Menage' (coddled eggs) and it was flat out gross... and even if it was good... it still was not very much food. The liver mush was about as bland as I've ever tasted. I forgot the name of my wife's dish, but it was essentially just finely diced sweet potato with a poached egg on top... that dish also had absolutely zero flavor and was very small.   Overall: I was hoping this would be a fun experience, but need up embarrassed to have been the one to recommend the place.",

I loved how the menus were setup differently. On little metal clipboards with the initials cut out. The menu itself is very enticing, so much so I wish I could've tried a bit of everything. I however opted for the shrimp and grits with a poached egg in the center. Right away I noticed the serving dish which was little smaller than I would've liked, but I went ain't with. The gravy was awesome and the grits were done good. My friend ordered the Wings and the Hash with gravy and eggs on top. He made the best choices. Those wings are AMAAAAZING!!! Fried just right and the gochugang sauce is great. Wet and yet still crispy like I love. I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "A group I belong to decided to have a brunch business meeting here. I was in charge of scheduling the reservation.  Prior to the meeting, I called the business several times to make a reservation. Each time, I got a voicemail message and left a message. I received no call back. When I finally got a live person, Savannah, she suggested making the reservation by email. My email was never responded to. Eventually, my colleague was able to get through to a live person and schedule a reservation. To me, it seemed that the business did not care about making money, as we were a fairly large group.   Once we arrived, since we were a fairly large group, they sat us outside in the blazing hot sun. I was so hot and my phone literally overheated. Also, the mood music was very loud and I could not hear my colleagues. I felt like Rihanna and Drake were in attendance at our meeting. So, maybe we did not pick the most appropriate place to hold a business meeting. Not necessarily holding that against Little Spoon.  The food was terrible. Little Spoon is trying too hard to be trendy and their food is overpriced, a la carte, and not good. First, I ordered a soft shell crab sandwich. It looked like a dead crab on a bun. It was fishy, sour and inedible. I sent it back and requested something else. I should note that I am not the most picky of people when it comes to food. I instead ordered a dish that was purple potatoes chopped up on a plate. Overpriced and not good either. It was dry and tasted burnt. I ended up not eating much at that meal.  When the bills came, we did not receive itemized receipts. Instead, in the name of being green, the waitress walked around with an iPad. When I got my receipt via email, I realized I paid for someone else's food and was overcharged. I called and asked for a credit. The manager explained, she would credit my credit card.   If I can avoid it, I will not be back.  Edit: after waiting awhile and not seeing a credit on my credit card, I emailed Little Spoon again. They sent me a copy of the receipt showing the credit to my card...except that it was not my card. Somebody must have been happy for the gift. Eventually, I did get my refund, but it was a lengthy process.",

    "text": "Oh LAWDD thank you!  I have been dreaming about this place!  Let's call a spade a spade here yelpers - this place is awesome.    I'm a brunch monster - and spend the majority of my week days agonizing over where I am going to eat brunch on Saturday and Sunday.  Obviously Fenwicks is my Sunday shizzle but my Saturday spot has been open for too long.  A friend and coworker told me about Little Spoon.  All she said was that I would love it - but I had NO IDEA how right she was going to be.  Okay, let's break it down.  Parking kind of sucks - but get over it.  If you are stuffing your face with earth shattering noms, chances are you need to walk a little.  The venue - IS - SO - COOL.  Vintage rustic industrial feel with open air, high ceilings and an exposed kitchen.  Even their plate ware and water pitchers are unique.  The music is not at all what you expect - but so freaking fun!  I'm not going to let the cat out of the bag, you'll have to go and listen for yourself.  Okay let's get to the meat (pun intended) - the food.  The menu is small - which to me says they make a few good things, and they make them well.  It's not your typical omelet and grits kind of place... so don't expect to see the iHop menu.  This is cuisine - and there is a lot that goes into it.  Highlights were the homemade PB&J pop-tart (it's like they know me), the BLT - I would literally bathe in their homemade lemon aioli, the breakfast sandwich, the pork belly bacon, and the coffee.   The cool thing is that because they are farm to plate the menu will change as they get in new and different items.  Prices are going to be a bit higher than your run of the mill breakfast joint... but still very reasonable.  I want to be sure I don't overlook the staff.  The waiters/waitresses are the backbone of this place.  How do they hire so many awesome people?!  I don't get it.  The Chef is always out on the floor making sure that people like their food, and helping out where need be.  And if my memory serves, the restaurant manager is also the same guy who helped to open Maverick Rock Taco on Park Road - and he is excellent.  Overall you can tell that Little Spoon puts their heart and soul into this restaurant and the food.  It's almost like when you step inside you morph into Asheville or Charleston.  Little Spoon is incredible and I hope that Charlotte starts to get more places like this - preferably closer to uptown.... but this is worth the drive.  See you next Saturday Little Spoon!",

The donut appetizer comes with three donuts per order and generous servings of ganache on the side and we all thought they were very good. I had the kale and pork belly served on cornbread (a special) which I thoroughly enjoyed and some friends had the burger special which they also said was delicious.   Our beverages were not the highlight of the meal. The orange juice tasted fresh squeezed, but unfortunately also tasted a little off which I would chalk up to the quality of the produce at this time of year. The two bloody marys at table were spicy/peppery but did not have a full body of flavor to complement the spiciness.   Our waitress was very nice and didn't bat an eye when we asked to pay separately. You can also call ahead to put your name on the wait list which was extremely helpful. We were able to walk in and get seated right away because we called in advance.",

I went to brunch here a couple weeks back and was happily blown away. This was luckily one of the weekends when it really warmed up so we got to sit outside. This is such a cute little place with a very weird choice of music. I chose the Chicken Biscuit after a recommendation from the server and was amazed. The biscuits would have been good on their own but adding the Cheer Wine Brined Crispy Chicken and garlic aioli it takes it to another level. I would have licked the plate but i thought that may have been frowned upon. The two friends I went with got the #BEC and the *SEC. They were both thoroughly impressed with their dishes. We all split a side of bacon as well. They bacon is definitely the star of this restaurant. It is house cured and absolutely fantastically thick and so rich. Whatever you do when you go here get the bacon it will change your life.",

The restaurant is full of grainy wood, red brick, cast iron and Edison styled light bulbs. I know this style isn't for everyone but it's everything I love in one restaurant. The bonus and nail in the coffin for the Brooklyn hipster vibe is the Outkast Pandora station that keeps the ambiance up beat!  The staff are numerous, attentive and friendly. They have ipads instead of order books so the orders go right in and paying the bill is about 5-10 minutes faster. The coffee is delicious and comes in a bowl which means you won't burn your tongue - too hot for hands means it's too hot for your mouth.  The menu is small, but mighty, for brunch and the specials make you think twice. I got the cheerwine brined chicken biscuits after changing my mind over, and over, and again after hearing the specials and again one last time. The food did not disappoint - it was delicious.  Some reviews point out that it's too pricey for what you get; $10-$20 is expensive for brunch and here you won't get the usual southern helpings. This price for real, prepared by hand food isn't all that bad. This is obviously not freshly thawed food from Sysco or otherwise and to me, I think, worth every penny!",

If you are an adventurous eater, this is the place to go!   The staff is friendly and laid back, as is the atmosphere (you'll hear a wide variety of music, ranging from Lil Wayne to Biggie Small to Top 40's hits, and depending upon your tastes, this could be perceived as a positive or negative contrast to the upscale Myers Park location.) The noise level also becomes loud once the restaurant is full, when you consider the small, but airy space and the music.  Exotic items which I've eaten here include Shredded Lamb Taco, Fish Cheeks, Smores Cookie, Grilled Peach Dessert, Bass Taco, Flounder Taco, Chicken and Waffles, Pork Loin, Corn Puppies, Moon Pie Dessert, Fried Yucca, Ceviche, Guacamole, and Bison Meatballs.   I don't always absolutely love everything that I eat here, but I do always love the variety and creativity in the dishes!   They always serve specialty or gourmet ingredients which I am unfamiliar with in the dishes, which is where the adventurous eating part comes in!  They also have a few select drinks specials, but I have not tried any of the cocktails.  Finding the parking lot can be a bit confusing, but once you do, there is generally an attendant who will direct you.",

I always think people won't be able to appreciate that music because it's so old, but to hear it brought back memories of my childhood from the 99 and the 2000. I sat outside, which was lovely to see all the people out in the neighborhood. Started to get a little warm, but there are some fans. The atmosphere is like a relaxed brunch lounge. Almost reminds me of 5church without all the acrylic decor, and more menu options at decent prices.   Anyway, the food. It was great. I had the cinnamon toast brulee I think it's called. It was really just bread with some type of melted sugar on top. Super fattening, but delicious. I had a mimosa, which wasn't anything too spectacular. It was made with Cava, which tasted kind of flat. I love Cava, as much as I love mimosas so that was a little disappointing.  I also had the jerk chicken lettuce cups. Really good! If you like a lot of food this is a good dish. The lettuce cups had so much filling I couldn't pick them up. It's a healthy meal minus the mayonnaise from the slaw, if they used mayo,  and light enough where you won't feel stuffed. Although I couldn't eat the whole entree it served me well later.   I will definitely be coming back to Little Spoon.",

    "text": "This place may be called LittleSpoon but no spoon required (at least for what I got). I'm fact the menu pretty much tells you what's needed and the have a section for hands and sporks. My favorite item may have been found on the snack menu.  The Korean Brussel sprouts are out of bounds. Fried and had a delicious  Korean sauce that I couldn't get enough of. Found myself dipping potatoes from my order of hash in it. Lol  Just needed bacon and they may have been the best sprouts I ever had. Also for the hash and it was pretty good as well. Love it when the egg bust and runs all over the potatoes. It comes with chicken sausage and onions. Keep in mind and probably should have led with this - the ingredients here at LOCAL. Which I love they do that .  Yes you can find some items that aren't so healthy like the Donuts but get the donuts as they are delicious. Coffee was good as well and didn't mind using both hands to sip out of this large  cup. Added bonus is you get a great energy here from 90s hip hop on deck. Takes me back.  As the the song goes ...Biggie Biggie Biggie can't you see ,sometimes your food hypnotize me",

We had a group of 6 and had an estimated wait time of 45-1 hour at noon.  What I loved most was the 90's hip hop that played during our meal... Biggie, Wu-Tang, Tu-PAC... it definitely brought me back!  The highlights of the meal included the breakfast potatoes with poutine (gravy and bacon), donut holes and the spicy Brussel sprouts.  My chicken biscuit had yummy chicken but the biscuit was sadly way to dry for my liking.  The bloody Mary was tasty but really small for the $11 price tag.  Overall this is a fun cozy spot and I would probably go to again!",

Didn't matter since all the doors were open but eventually the good coffee kept us warm. Service was very good and food was a little above average but not great for a place that is a bit pricey and somewhat pretentious. Agree on the double up-charge a previous poster mentioned. Not cool.   Anyway, they were piping loud rap music which I often enjoy but looking around, there was a family with three young kids and an 80 yo couple. The lyrics of the song we sat down to were beyond explicit and it just didn't seem like a good time to be hearing so many F bombs and what they wanted to do to p*ssy. Perhaps if they change their name to Lil' Poon, I would have been more prepared for the breakfast experience we were walking into.",

When we asked about this, they said that they had reservation for all the tables in 30 mins and they did not want to rush us.   Second try: We were the first at the restaurant and they proceeded to jam people around, us with the restaurant being empty. Tried the donuts, too expensive for 3 tiny donut holes which tasted like microwaves Krispy Kreme donuts.  The menu says CHICKEN BISCUIT, but they give you two. The server did a great job upselling  the pork belly bacon, but when the menu implies 1 chicken biscuit we assumed a $2 charge. However they serve 2 biscuits so they charge $4 - deceptive. The biscuit was extremely good, the chicken was too small to taste the flavor. I had to open the biscuit to see if they put on the chicken.   My wife had the STICKY RICE and it the rice was not sticky and too sweet.   Atmosphere: table rocked (they tried to fix) the floor was extremely dirty for being there 5 mins after opening and the music was too loud with a lack of diversity of genres.",

    "text": "Wow. What an awful experience from beginning to end! Upon arrival, we were told there was a 20 minute wait despite seeing at least 10 tables that were unoccupied and set for their next diner. The host proceeded to tell us that they had to give this first to all the people in line ahead of us (there were 4 people sitting in the waiting area.) So we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and wait. They had an actual DJ there playing dance club music, to the point that we had to yell to hear each other. This was at 12:45 pm, not your typical club time. Fast forward the 20 minutes to when our table was ready, and we got back to the host stand where 2 other couples were complaining about how loud the music was. The host was telling them that he didn't think anything could be done about that. We agreed with them. We looked around as he got our menus, and saw that the 10 previous open tables were still open. Why did we have to wait 20 minutes?! He then proceeded to take us to a table outside in the 90 degree heat and direct sunlight. We stopped him and asked if we could sit at one of the many tables inside (10 open inside and how many outside, and we had to sit 20 minutes?!) he hesitated, sighed and said he would find one for us, but it was either too hot or too loud, and we were making our choice. I understand you can't do anything about the heat outside in August, but if half of your patrons inside are complaining about the volume of the music, there are ways to overcome that. After walking past 5 available tables, he decided upon a small hightop in the bar area. Our server arrived quickly with a bottle of water and 2 small glasses, and poured us each a half a glass of water. We were ready to order. We got the chicken biscuits and the hash. As we waited, we nearly finished our bottle of water and sat in disbelief as the DJ played songs with highly questionable language (\"Iget more ass than a toilet seat\"? Remember, this is a brunch place at 12:45 pm, not a night club.) Our food arrived. The chicken on the biscuits reminded me of the chicken from a frozen chicken biscuit from the gas station. The biscuit fell apart at the moment I picked it up and was very bland. My wife's opinion of it was \"the pickles are good.\" The hash had only one egg on it, which for the size of the dish, and the price, we felt should have had 2. Some of the potatoes were not fully cooked, what else may have not been cooked enough? The flavors were okay, but did not combine well, and were nothing special that would help make Little Spoon stand apart from any other restaurant. We decided that we would rather wait at Zada Jane's (where you wait because all the tables are full) to have their hash than this one.   After we finished our meal, our server returned with an iPad for us to pay on, he showed me the bill on there and stood over me as I completed my payment.   We will not be returning. When there are so many good restaurants in Charlotte, and particularly in this area, there is no reason to waste our time and money on a place like this.",

    "text": "Right when they first opened I wrote a review talking about how great the food and service were, but then picked apart a couple of the other shortcomings.  I decided to delete that one and wait for them to iron out the kinks and then give them another shot.  As a farm to table place, I've got to respect what they are doing.  I'm glad I came back.  I went in for brunch today and the place just seemed to have a more personable feel.  I was greeted instantly by a smiling hostess.  I really like the idea of the countdown board at the hostess stand.  They have a certain number of burgers and a certain number of pop tarts per day, if you snooze, you lose.  But, at least they let you know where you're at.  Anyhow, after being promptly seated, my attentive server Sherydan asked if I wanted sparkling or still water, not something you get asked very often in the states.  As I assume pretty much anyone else that grew up in the south would do, I went with the still.  Also, I got me a coffee.  I had read other review where people commented on the coffee cup not having a handle, so I wasn't surprised at that.  I honestly didn't mind it, the mug was thick enough where it wasn't too hot to hold.  I will say it would have been cool if they had almond milk as well as the coconut milk, but that's just me.   After giving me a few minutes to decide, my server came back to ask what I wanted to order.  I would have loved to have ordered the cassoulet, but it just seemed to heavy from that early in the morning so after much thought I finally decided on the shashuska.  If a breakfast place takes the time to bake eggs in a sauce, I'm going to try it.  I'm glad the food didn't take too awful long because I was quite hungry and the smells in this place were just making it worse.  My eggs were cooked just right and the toast soaked it up perfectly.  The pomodoro sauce came out great as well.  I didn't really get a lot of the flavor from the fennel, and parsnips aren't necessarily my favorite, but all in all it was a great dish.  At only a couple bucks more than a small breakfast sandwich, brunch seems like a great deal.  After my meal my lovely server asked me if I wanted some coffee to go, but I declined, those huge cups(bowls) were plenty.  I did take a little bit of leftovers to go, I know that pomodoro sauce would mix in well with the vodka sauce I made last night.  I quickly was handed my ipad to cash out on and on to the rest of my day I went.  I don't live in the area, so I don't know if I'll be back anytime soon.  That said, I'm glad to see this place has made some changes for the better, and love what they are doing style wise.  Even the music was more tolerable this time, although sappy 80's love songs wasn't exactly what I was looking for on this specific day.",

I am pleased that this is a farm to fork and supports local growers. They seem to have classic opening growing pains in that the menu is very limited and both times I was there they were out of items from the very small offering.  The food was very tasty and I am hoping that they will be successful!",

They brought the salad and burger before the wings and had to figure out what happened to the wings. They brought them out after we finished our meal. They were pretty terrible. Hot and flavorless with what seemed to be oil drizzled around them on the plate. Not sure what that was for. The farro salad had a couple chopped up tomatoes, barely any arugula, one tiny slice of cucumber and it didn't even fill the tiny plate. The burger wasn't bad. I enjoyed it. The water they served in a chilled decanter tasted like tap water. We wanted to tell them our issues with the food to give them a helpful and honest review but they never asked how our food or anything was. So we kept it to ourselves and decided to just not go back. Bad atmosphere, overpriced, lousy food, no apologies for messing up our order. Real bummer.",

    "text": "Was so excited to try Little Spoon for the first time. It was a Sunday for brunch and they were understandably packed. Hostess said it was a 30min wait and we were more than happy to wait. After 45 mins went by and we were not seated, we approached the hostess stand to see where we stood in line. I was told a text was sent to us to be seated and we were marked as a no-show. I showed the hostess, holding up my iPhone, that no text was sent which is why we had come back. Then I asked if she could see what number she put down. First, the hostess said the system wouldn't allow her to bring up the number. Then, she said there were too many Melissa reservations. Then miraculously she turned an iPad around to show me a list of numbers which were all incorrect. I was confused because she had initially repeated the number back to me, and it was correct. She repeated tried to tell me it was my fault for not responding...but she had typed in the number wrong! (She wrote it down when we first entered the restaurant, so she keyed it in wrong.) The the hostess said I should have come back to tell her that I didn't receive a text...But that's what I was doing now!!! Horrible customer service and what a shame, I never got to try it. Will not be recommending this restaurant and will not try again.",

    "text": "Little Spoon=LIttle Portions  Stopped by for lunch today at 2 pm.  The restaurant was  empty when we arrived.  Thought they would be busier on a Friday afternoon.  I arrived before the rest of my party so I had the server bring me some water.  Asked for a lemon.  At first she almost implied that they didn't have any then said she would have to cut one up or she can bring me some lemon juice.  I was a little taken aback that she was less than willing to accommodate my simple request.  I ordered the pork belly sandwich on brioche.  The pork belly was tasty but very fatty.  the brioche bun was dry and fell apart.  My wife ordered the short rib sandwich,  she thought it was good but the bread just fair.   I was disappointed when the server brought the food and there was not any type of accompaniment with our food.  Perhaps a pasta salad, fries,  anything would have been nice.  I would have paid a little more for a complete meal.  Or we had known we could have ordered a side.    I'm all in favor of the farm to table but they need to put a little more thought to their menu planning.  Perhaps it should be farm to school (to learn how to plan a restaurant) to table.  Needless to say everyone with me left hungry.",

Menus were industrial funky and somewhat minimalist, but in a good way IMO. Service was quick although some in our party didn't like our waiter. The crowd was a mix of hipster and middle-aged with kids, but I wonder if the latter were only there since it was Sunday brunch. I had grits with chicken sausage and it was innovative and excellent, but I wished for a bigger serving. Their hash was also excellent and unique. A big disappointment was their bloody mary, which the waiter said wasn't spicy but the 4 people at our table all agreed they clearly were - and apart from that the taste wasn't much. If you aren't interested in talking to your fellow diners or like to shout at them while eating innovative food and washing it down with an average drink in a semi-pretentious environment, this place is for you.",

The choices are unique, but I think we went in desiring some of the more traditional brunch fare.  For someone that is craving your standard savory (egg type dish like a benedict) or sweet (Pancakes/french toast) brunch type dish, there aren't that many choices to fulfill those desires.  Since not much was jumping out at me, I went for the burger.  Overall, it was a decent burger, but a $14 burger without sides is a bit of a stretch.  I wish the waitress would have highlighted that it didn't come with anything.  Usually for brunch, you'd expect grits, potatoes, fruit, etc. as a side, especially at that price point.  Overall, it wasn't bad, but there are so many great places to get brunch in this town, I can't say we'll be rushing back.",

Our food took way too long to arrive (we had to ask the waiter about it after watching two tables who arrived after us get their food before we did). The manager came out to apologize, and I understand that delays happen. So no big deal really. But then our food was pretty much tasteless - unless it was sweet. Slab bacon was gorgeous looking but had no taste whatsoever. Jalapeno butter brioche wasn't spicy at all, and there was no seasoning on any of the food within. Boule tasted like bread and egg with thick flavorless meat. And the kicker - no salt or pepper on any tables. The cinnamon French toast was yummy, luckily. And the donuts were flavorless except for the syrupy berries around them. I'm so sad to have to give it a less than positive review. Especially after all the raves I've heard. My fingers are crossed that things get more flavorful over time.",

But that said, the food is a bit pricey for what you get.  And my dish was not very memorable in quality.  I got a Caesar Salad, which the server said was an entree-sized portion.  She also proceeded to alert me to the fact that there were anchovies in the salad.  The salad consisted of a nice-sized piece of lettuce, some slivers of cheese and dressing on the side...that's it!  No croutons and no anchovies to be found.  I trust that they were in the dressing, but, if so, they sure did not pack a wallop.  While the dressing itself was OK, it was in no way memorable.  For $9, I felt a bit underwhelmed.  The only saving grace was to go a few doors down in the shopping center and have two pieces of to-die-for chocolate truffles in the wine and chocolate shop.",

I'm not even going to complain about the slow service because when you go out to brunch on a Sunday at noon, I guess an extraordinary wait time (both for the table but then again to be served once seated) is kind of expected.  The chief problem here is that the portions are tiny and the prices are sky high.  I paid $9 (plus tax and tip) for half a heart of romaine, 3 tablespoons of dressing, and 5 slivers of parmesan.  Some of my friends didn't finish their food because it was not very good, and yet we all left hungry (even those of us who cleaned our plates) because the portions were so meagre.  My sister ordered the same quinoa porridge as my cousin, but got about half as much; when she asked the waitress about it, she was instructed to \"fluff it up a bit.\"  It was a strange experience.  The quality of the ingredients is the only reason I give it 2 stars; at least they are trying to provide interesting options.",

We got there right after they opened and we were the first ones there for a while. My husband ordered a latte and was pleased. For restaurant espresso it was pretty good, obviously going to a local coffee shop would bring slightly different expectations. I ordered a glass of their house made lemonade, it was delicious! Not overly sweet and it was carbonated which I enjoyed.  At this point I'll also mention that they do all locally sourced ingredients from North and South Carolina. Their menu is also a tapas style menu so keep that in mind when thinking of portion size.  We ordered all of our items with the plan to share. The first item we picked were the donuts which came with 3 mini ones on a chocolate ganache. They we're delicious! We also ordered their potato hash without sausage. It was decent, the onions and peppers were higher in proportion to the potato and onions and peppers were slightly undercooked. Overall though the flavor was there. We also ordered the brioche with jalapeno egg white which came with tomato jam. The sandwich was very good but the tomato jam was amazing! I seriously could have just drank it. It tasted like ketchup but with a better tomato flavor and a slightly chunkier quality.  If you are a vegetarian there isn't much on the menu but they seemed flexible with ordering items without the meat.  Can't wait to go back!",

Serving hot coffee in mugs without handles (aka bowls) was a bit difficult to navigate if you like to drink your coffee hot but not trying to singe your hands on the bowl.

The corn bread muffins with chocolate chips were dry and did not come out until after our entrees even though we'd requested them first. The chicken biscuits were big and filling - my husband ate only one. The porridge was heavy on creamy coconut milk so it felt more soupy -- I like it thicker and grainier. The diced green apple on top was a genius touch to break up the cloying coconut milk. However, as I progressed through the bowl, the milk tasted more like clotted coconut cream and was unfinishable. If you love coconut milk this may not bother you. Our total was $35. Because we'd ordered dense foods we were full and still had a chicken biscuit and two muffins to take home.",

No.  The bottom of the bowl is of course too hot to hold....unlike my coffee.  So after we were finished the waitress asks would you like a to-go cup for your coffee? Sure. Then I stared fearfully at this bowl of coffee and my to go cup and sized up how exactly I was going to make this transfer.",

But, if he was writing this review, they'd have 10 stars. So, maybe this is a \"dude\" place. I dunno.   As other reviewers have said, they do blast old school rap and hip hop. I kinda liked it but will admit, it didn't fit the rest of the \"scene.\" We went early enough that the restaurant wasn't packed (maybe 6-8 full tables) so it wasn't crazy loud.   The food was all solid. Potatoes with housemade ketchup and garlic aioli were great. I had the chicken biscuits, also delish! The bacon wasn't quite my cup of tea (more like pork belly) but my boyfriend loved it.   My one real complaint are those damn hipster coffee bowls without handles. I ordered a coconut milk cappuccino which was delicious... once it cooled down enough for me to be able to pick it up to taste. Because the cups don't have handles and they're serving hot coffee in them, they're simply too hot to pick up for the first 10-15 minutes your coffee arrives. There's not much I hate more in the world than having to wait on coffee in the morning.",

Maybe I need to go in for a weekday breakfast or lunch.  We went around 11 am on a Sunday, prime time for brunch, which I realize. I don't mind waiting and we expected to have to wait. Luckily, the wait was quicker than we were quoted (45 minutes), and they have an awesome little app system that tells you how long you've waited and how much longer you have. That was an A+ touch!  We bought coffees from the coffee bar during our wait. $3.50 for a regular coffee is insane and priced much too high. This was the first thing I saw as off.  Once we were seated, we checked out the menu's and put an order in for the cinnamon toast brulee. However, that app didn't end up coming out until AFTER our food, which was a bummer because by that time, some of my appetite was gone and I was looking forward to trying this dish before. I had the shashuska, which was just ok. I tasted alot of spice, but ultimately, I think it still lacked flavor. They do give you ample bread for dipping in the tomato sauce, which I did appreciate. My husband had the SEC with chicken sausage, which is actually very small in size and you don't get a side with it.  The service was mediocre. We actually had to go up and refill our water a few times, and the waitor didn't ask if we wanted refills on our coffee (cold and empty at this point) until after we received our bill and were ready to go.  Not sure I would return here.",

    "text": "Little Spoon?! What?!  Man oh man, do I love brunch or what?! First, let's talk about how freaking adorable this restaurant is and where it's located. For anyone who lives near the area, apparently this area is known for \"old money\" rich people. So, the demographic of this area is very high maintenance and very very very classy. But, that didn't stop me and my family from getting our brunch fix! Usually, this place is known to become busy and the wait would be about 45 mins to an hour. Luckily for me, we only had to wait 20 minutes and was then seated and greeted by one of their lovely servers.   As soon as we sat down, we were immediately served iced water and was left with a big glass of water for the table to share (smart idea)! The waiter was extremely attentive and helpful when it came to explaining their featured specials and as well as the menu itself. The atmosphere reminded me of a night club but is converted into a restaurant during the day. My table started off with their \"snacks\" called DoNuts. Their \"DoNuts\" was covered in glazed and sat on top of creme anglaise and chocolate ganache. It usually comes with only three donuts but because my table had four people, the waitress added an extra donut without any extra cost. Talk about southern hospitality?! The donuts were to die for, they melted right in my mouth and wasn't too sweet. It was the perfect snack right before my main entree came out from the kitchen.   As I was waiting for my food, I noticed how much kimchi they had on their menu! Apparently they love their pork belly and kimchi! When my table's food came out, everything just looked so savory and delicious. As confirmed, everyone enjoyed their entree and was full by the time we had left. If there is one negative thing I could say about my dish was that it was just too oily for me (but hey, I still ate it and it was amazing).",

With a plethora of wonderful brunch options in Charlotte, Little Spoon really needs to reconsider their food offerings and especially their price point.  I ordered the \"menage,\" advertised to come with eggs, grits, sweet potato puree, and ciabatta. The dish came and it was two very small bowls of puree and grits with eggs cracked on top. Looking around at other tables, the dishes looked quite small despite all items being $10+. I left still hungry and disappointed in my strange dish.  I think Little Spoon has a unique, hipster vibe and their menu is inventive. However, it is simply not cutting it when I can get phenomenal omelets or biscuits elsewhere for half the price and twice the quantity.",

The Porchetta was incredibly filling and had a really great savory flavor profile. The sticky rice was also out of this world and had a perfect balance of savory to sweet ratio which I'm really picky about. The price was more than fair for how full you leave.",

Everyone was smiling, everyone greeted me and they were blasting classic hip hop....and it was only noon. Now that's what you call a welcome!   For starters we ordered the Root Vegetable Pappardelle which were a mix of crispy parsnips and crispy carrots. Ahhhmazing. They had so much flavor! I really enjoyed munching on these to start the meal.   After a quick chat with the waitress and asking for her recommendations, I ordered the Short Rib with and my friend ordered the Jerk Chicken.   Man....that Short Rib sandwich was delicious. The baguette was crispy, the short rib was so tender and goat cheese spread just put it over the top. I loved every....single...bite. I might need to amend my last meal on earth and add this to my list....sorry mom. My friend let me try her Jerk Chicken and it was tender and packed just the right amount of spiciness. And I love how  they let you opt for the lettuce cups instead of the baguette. My friend raved about them so I know she's a fan, just like I am!   I'm looking forward to heading back on a Thursday night to sample their dinner menu......  Great job Little Spoon, you have a new fan!",

I would say I was a bit underwhelmed with the little spoon.   We were seated immediately upon arriving at 9. Our waitress was very friendly and the restaurant is eclectic and modern. The menu is relatively small, but offers a good variety of breakfast dishes; ranging from appetizer like foods, to dishes you can eat by hand or \"spork.\"  We decided on the chicken and biscuits and chicken sausage sandwhich; both of which have an interesting name on the menu. We also got the donut bites (also a unique name on the menu). There were 3 donut bites for around 5 dollars. Although delicious, hardly worth the price for such a small amount. I will say both dishes, although again small, were delicious and worth the price.   Overall, little spoon lives up to its name, but should consider somewhat larger dishes if they continue to keep their prices on the \"big spoon\" side.",

    "text": "Well, I have been saving my energy for this review.  What a huge disappointment!!  I was so excited to try this new place out.  The location is great, the interior is trendy, but the greatness stops there.    Parking: forget about it.  Leave your car at the gas station for a full up and go grab a bite to eat.  That's your best bet for parking.    Service: the waitress could care less and probably took lesson on how to avoid the customer even when they are staring you down.  I say she must have been valedictorian of her class!! Oh, and you have to pay at the table with an iPad while they stare at you. That makes tipping crappy service even more awkward.    Dining: I thought I would need an ambulance by the time I left.  I kept trying to put my feet under my chair, due to the limited space under the table for two sets of legs, and there was a metal bar that kept lacerating my foot.  I felt like I was sitting in a chair designed to be uncomfortable so you do not stay too long.    Food: way too greasy, bacon is way too thick, and the bread for the breakfast sandwich is hard enough to break a window.    The coffee cups have no handles so you boil the skin off of your hands while trying to enjoy a morning cup of Joe.  The orange juice that was freshly squeezed was okay, but it came in a cup so small that it seemed as though I was drinking a sample from a grocery store salesman.    Take home lesson about this experience, avoid this place until they have a more organized and user friendly concept.",

The inside had nice exposed brick and a semi open kitchen.  We started off with the Bacon! OMG, delicious doesn't say enough for this bacon. It's more of a pork belly slab. Absolutely loved it, 3 decent sized pieces.   For entrees, I selected the Chicken biscuit. It turned out to be 2 full sized biscuits stuffed with delicious fried chicken that appeared to have some type of brine or marinade to pull out the taste. This was really enough for 2 people to share. Hubby had the Sec- chicken sausage with scrambled eggs and white cheddar, it was very favorable. The bread was a bit heavy. We also tried the deconstructed potatoes. They were hot and crispy.  Overall good experience. About $40 for all the items above. Also keep in mind the items are all tapas style and don't have accompanying sides, so be sure to plan ahead.",

    "text": "Farm to table?  Yes Please!  This place is located right off Selwyn and I have always wondered what it would be like to get breakfast here on the weekend.  Luckily I tried it out the other day and was super impressed.  It was a beautiful fall morning... just finished an 11 mile run so I was definitely hungry.  We got there fairly early and people had started trickling in for a Saturday.  Decided on eating outside and getting some sun for a change, but it was near perfect.  Our server Sheridan (spelling?) was really nice, we explained it was our \"first time\" here so she gave us the run-down on their approach to food and how the menu depends on what they were able to get locally, etc.  Menu is constantly changing so be prepared!  I basically wanted to order everything because it all sounded good.  I can't remember my drink's official name, but it was based off a recommendation for a nice \"patio\" drink.  Tito's, grapefruit juice, rosemary... reminded me of a Moscow mule, but lighter.  I ordered some slab bacon - of which I should have brought a change of pants with me (sorry if that was TMI, but man.... SO GOOD!  And I went with the day's special of Steak and Eggs.  The eggs were perfectly poached and the yolk provided a nice dressing for the bed of arugula that they rested on in combination of the chipotle aioli sauce.    The rotating menu and super fresh ingredients may be a little off-putting to folks, especially if you are expecting this place to be competitive with a breakfast/brunch diner that slings out breakfast to the masses.  But the approach and care that Little Spoon takes into its food make it all worth it (to me).",

I decided I would ask if there was a mistake and if we could get real cups but the manager sitting at the bar laughed and said that was just the way their cups were. We just left without finishing our coffee, she never came back and had to get our check as we left, awful experience, plus the tables next to us were dirty and full of residue food, such a shame.",

    "text": "So I'm going to start with the most obvious complaint.  No handles on the coffee cups.  Seriously bad move for anyone who drinks coffee black.  However, while they serve coffee in bowls, they serve porridge in coffee cups with handles.  Seriously.    Then there is the tea selection, which in a word, stinks.  Especially when the waitress made such a big production out of bringing the selections out for me to choose from.  Four teas are not a selection.  Trust me, since I drink hot tea daily, four teas, in bags no less, is a joke.  You want to charge the prices on the menu, I expect a teapot with a special house blend like chamomile lavender and served with a tea strainer.  The menu... Well to be honest, overpriced and pretentious might be a kind way to say this.  Yes, this is farm to table, which is a great concept. Hey, I even grew up on a farm, so I can really appreciate that. But the menu was unimaginative. And realistically, $16 for a BLT?  I live in DC, and that's what I expect there. Nothing personal, if you want to charge that, it needs to be way better, like best food on the planet better, and in a space where I'm not listening to crap music that's so loud it's not very easy to converse with my friends.  Finally, the bill.  Only it is on a tablet the waitress held for us, and she simply announces how much it is.  Then she swipes the card for you then, turns it towards you to confirm one of 3 preset tip amounts, the lowest being 18%.  So you think being somewhat average deserves 18%? No.  The you use your finger to sign the screen.  And you have to request a copy of the receipt. If you are worried about paper, email it to people.  And what ever happened to letting me review my bill and pay at my leisure?  As my friend puts it, this restaurant is trying too hard to be edgy and instead comes off as pretentious just for the sake of being pretentious.  Quite honestly, go elsewhere and have a better brunch you can enjoy with friends.",

    "text": "My fiance and I came here for brunch on a Sunday and sat outside. The server we had was sub-par and the food was just ok but the ultimate issue was the service and lack of concern or apology for the experience we had. we ordered the jalapeno biscuits as an app and after we put the order in the server came our saying they were out...your a breakfast/brunch spot how do you run out of biscuits??? So then we order the bacon app and it was OK...I wouldn't order again. Then where it's really interesting was when we order the main food. I order chicken sandwich and my fiance orders the mic drop biscuit sandwich. My chicken sandwich was good but to be honest it was not $11 good for just a small chicken sandwich with no side...I rather go to chick fil and get a number one for $6. Then the mic drop my fiance got was a joke...so tiny and it literally was not edible. It was so chewy he couldn't even chew through it to swallow. When telling the server she was pointless and made us feel stupid for even saying anything. We sent back the sandwich and ordered the chicken sandwich instead and after waiting 25 mins on it decided to ask for the check and leave. The waitress didn't even apologize at all and said the reason for the wait was that they had so many orders. We had to send his first one back therefore his should take priority for your problem! So my fiance left hungry with not eating anything and we both left confused about the whole situation. We definitely won't be back despite living in the area.",

Also, to add to other reviewers comments about the music: I enjoy early 2000s music as much as anyone else, but there's only so much 112 and B2K one can listen to back to back.",

    "text": "Such a great little brunch/lunch spot.  I had heard great things about this little place and decided to try it a few weeks back, since I was moving from Charlotte soon there after.    The decor and ambiance is awesome.  I consider the decor upscale hipster (if that makes sense ;) ) and good old school music was playing while my friend and I were enjoying brunch.   We ordered a carafe of their mimosas to start and the mimosas were delicious.  I believe the juice is freshly squeezed, so the mimosas were not overly sweet and just perfect!   My friend and I ordered the chicken biscuits and the pork banh mi to share and a side of the doughnuts with the chocolate drizzle. The portions are not overly large so it was good we weren't starving (hence why the 4 star rating), but they were very tasty.  The chicken was just ever so lightly fried, extremely crisp and not oily at all.  The pork in the banh mi sandwich was so moist and the bun provided the perfect sweetness to the savory pork. The doughnuts were just okay.  I wasn't a fan of the chocolate sauce.   The service was great.  Our server was a little quirky and made funny jokes.  Overall, we had a great time.  I wish I would have gotten a chance to eat there one more time before I moved. It will definitely be a place I will visit whenever I come up to Charlotte! It is definitely a place I highly recommend!",

Once the parking is fixed and landlord can jack rent they are out of business.    Have been twice. Lunch and breakfast.  Lunch was fine average. Wasn't crowded and food was average.  Those were the positives.  Negatives were you leave hungry and prices are absurd.  If you want a $25 meal and then have to find your second lunch before heading back to work, definitely hit this place up.   Brunch was an unmitigated disaster. I can walk to this place, and parking is non-existent as stated in other reviews, but I harbor no positive vibe.  Waitstaff is indifferent at best. They seem to believe the restaurant is a desirable place to eat and has good food, service and value. They are clearly confused.  Eggs were dry. Bread was stale. Bacon tasted like it was boiled before it was cooked. But at least I got to hear about everybody in the neighborhood's issues on this fine weekend morning as the tables are stacked on top of one another.  At least the waiters have ink, tight pants and mustaches. That makes me feel trendy!  This space will eventually have a good dining experience in it. Little Spoon will not be it.",

It was very entertaining , and a blast from the past especially when ODB and Dougie Fresh came on. Not overly loud but definitely lent to the hip vibe. Is it hip that we were all over 40 commenting on this vintage rap from our 20s? Lol peace out Biggie. On to the food! I had the pork with coconut sticky rice and it was sooooo good. The Korean twist on standard favorites is inspired and filling!!! My friends had the chorizo hash, and the Korean Brussels which are equally good. I loved the cucumber watermelon salad. You can tell they take pride and really make sure each dish is perfect before it's set in-front of you. I can see where some people may complain about the speed of service but come on. It is the south. Even if it is populated mostly by NY transplants. Recommend.",

    "text": "Listen... I honestly don't know how long the wait was originally, I was too busy two-stepping through the door! The music and the vibe of this place for BRUNCH is wonder-fabulous!   Everyone was smiling, talking and enjoying the music! I believe the hostess originally told us that the wait was about 30+ minutes, but I received a text that our table was ready after about 10 minutes, so that worked out perfect!   We were seated outside, but never felt disconnected from the ambiance of the place nor did we sacrifice service... our waitress greeted us within three minutes. The menu is ever-changing (so I've been told) so that's what keeps it new and fresh. I decided to go with the chicken biscuits and beau enjoyed an order of livermush (yuck! for me). It took about 10 minutes for our food to arrive and it looked just like the pictures on the website and from other Yelpers (I like True representation of food, I'm weird like that lol).   My chicken biscuits were soooo good. Almost two good because they were flaking all over the place. Without any shame, I just picked up the pieces from my plate and enjoyed them. Ultimately, my plate look like a toddler learning how to eat for the first time by themselves, but it was so good that I didn't care. Not to mention, my neighbor ordered the same thing and he too was struggling with keeping the fresh biscuit together. Clearly, we didn't care and you shouldn't either if that's what you decide to go with.   Ultimately, I WILL BE BACK (mainly because my mom FaceTimed while I was there and she was hype over the music and now wants to go)! If you're in the Park Road area and you haven't tried LittleSpoon, you're missing out on the good stuff!",

They have various coffee beverages that you can get spiked which is nice however you can't really taste the coffee spiked flavor. Maybe they can give more then a shot of liquor. The food was flavorful and decent portions the prices were affordable. The biscuits were hard but the chicken inside was yummy. The bacon was thick and a juicy slab. If you aren't use to that style watch out you will get the itis easily from eating it. The hash was good I wish it had more veggies... it just had the peppers. The staff were friendly and they were accommodating with families or children. The chairs weren't that comfortable. The place was clean and decor was electric. Overall it's nice, but they can be great. It's up to them.",

Dishes are smaller portions for average dollar. So, if you are starrrrving and you are looking for something to fill you up for average cost, this isn't your place.

My friends and I only had to wait about 15 minutes. Our server Monica gave us great recommendations and conversation. Now let's break down the must-haves:  1. Fresh squeezed grapefruit juice (they also have orange) - it was so good, I got some to go. No pulp for those that care.  2. Korean brussel sprouts - I love anything with go chu jang sauce but these had the perfect amount of crisp and kick.  3. BLT - I'm admittedly not the biggest fan of pork belly but this is what's used on the BLT. They were able to make it extra crispy and I was surprisingly impressed.   They get extra points for supporting local small businesses for many of their menu items. My only regret is waiting this long to try it!",

Coffee is served in mug bowls that beg for cupped hands and slow sips.    My meal was plated beautifully but tasted even better. A fluffy omelette on a bed of greens, goat cheese, and homemade tomatillo sauce served on a slice of crusty sourdough.   Monica, a server, has to be one of the best I've encountered. She was engaging and noticeably intuitive. Items appeared before I realized I needed them. She gave a dish recommendation that proved to be a perfect fit. I watched her make multiple patrons feel like they were her only customers.   Enjoyed watching Sheridan, today's brunch bartendress, pop out beautiful cocktails and coffees with marked precision.   Indoor seating is table and bar seats with outdoor tables dusted in morning sun.   Check this space out. It's certainly going to become one of my regular spots.",

Save time and money and avoid this place:  When we arrived it was clear the restaurant was mismanaged - There were groups of people waiting to be seated and tables inside that had been bused but not reset for quite some time.  The wait staff and managers were standing around chatting or on their phones and could be overheard complaining about customers and their jobs.  All while ignoring their patrons.  When we were finally seated, our waitress was nowhere to be found.  The manager remarked he wasn't sure where she was.  We sat there for 15-20 minutes without anyone so much as taking our drink order.  When our waitress finally reappeared - with a clear attitude problem - She proceeded to help tables around us but not help us.  The manager finally came to take our order and claimed the issues were because of a large brunch rush that just left but that shouldn't be the customers problem.  A busy restaurant is not an excuse to compromise customer service and quality.  The manager finally took our order and scrutinized me for asking for balsamic dressing instead of the honey Dijon, saying he needed a larger notepad for all of my customizations...rude!!! Then when the finishing touches were being put out our salad we noticed the person doing it was picking his noise, had a bandaid on his finger and not wearing gloves while touching peoples food.  We overheard our waitress say give them honey Dijon and not balsamic to mess with us.  How infuriating!  The manager didn't follow through to make sure our order was delivered to our table so our food sat under heat lamps for 20 minutes or longer.  I had to ask for my food and the waitress who brought it over gave us attitude.  When it arrived, the food was wrong and tasted as though it had sat out.  If this wasn't bad enough - we were seated by the kitchen and overhead the manager telling the wait staff to stop eating off customers plates...how gross!!!",

    "text": "Why did I try this place again?! A friend of mine suggested it, and since it had been a few months since my last visit, I thought maybe it had gotten better since then and wanted to give it another chance. While it's not any worse than it was, it's definitely not any better. My impressions of this experience:  --There were only maybe 4 or 5 other tables in the place, yet both times I wanted a refill on my coffee, I had to request one. This was in spite of the fact that our server had been to our table to check on us and must have seen that our cups were empty. He was right on top of taking payment once we finished our food, though.  --The server was nice, however, and made sure to check that over easy eggs on the BEC sandwich were ok for my pregnant friend to eat.  --The coffee was still really good. The coffee and the friendliness were the only really good things about this visit. Everything else was eh.  --The BEC sandwich cost $8 and was about the same size as a Starbucks breakfast sandwich (which costs half as much) but didn't even taste as good. The slab of bacon (which was ham-style, super thick bacon) was greasy and flavorless. The whole thing was just bland and seemed like it needed some kind of sauce or seasoning. While I can appreciate the fact that this is a farm-to-table, sit-down dining experience, I would expect to get something at least as good if not better tasting than what a giant chain coffee shop is offering.   --The menu is still in that weird, hard-to-decipher format. My friend couldn't figure out what to order because they're still just listing ingredients and neglecting preparation/presentation. I sort of knew what to expect, but some of the newer items were totally cryptic.  --\"Liver mush\" has got to be the most disgusting name for a dish that I've ever heard. It might be good. I wouldn't know, because the name sounded so awful that I didn't dare try it.  Little Spoon continues to be an okay experience at a premium price. I love the location. I love the space. PLEASE step up the food game and make your menu format more approachable! It baffles me that such good ingredients are being used to prepare such average-tasting items. This place could and should be miles better.",

I ordered the grilled peach parfait (grilled peaches, cornbread and honey whip cream). The peaches were a little on the unripe side and it was derived in a mason jar. While cute presentation wise, it made for difficult eating. The \"bacon\" was more along the style of a piece of pork chop rather than actual bacon in my opinion. I would like to return to try the regular menu, but likely sit outside away to get a break from the overly hipster atmosphere",

The french toast brulee sounded great, but was basically toast with butter, cinnamon and sugar, not worth $6.  The fried chicken biscuits were okay, biscuits were very dry, but the garlic aioli on the side helped a little and tasted wonderful. My boyfriend has one of the specials with a cut of beef, and sauteed veggies.  He said it was pretty good, but I cannot comment on that, because I didn't try it.  Coffee was great, even though there were coffee grinds in mine.  The server poured it and saw as she was pouring, and just walked away! Pure Intentions coffee always brings it though, so I still drank it. Our server wasn't the best, she forgot when I asked for a box, and ignored us for 10-15 minutes when we were clearly done.  All in all, I would give it another shot, maybe for a weekday lunch rather than brunch.  It ended up being a little over $50 for coffees, toast, and two brunch items.  A little hefty for what we got in my opinion.",

    "text": "Decor and quality of ingredients deserve 5 Stars, so why am I only giving it 3 stars?....  As soon as I walked in I was very impressed with the tasteful atmosphere of Little Spoon.  It has a very pleasant and chill vibe to it.  The menu is limited which they attribute to only using what ingredients are available locally.  I can appreciate that.  But the menu is really Very limited.    We settled on two dishes to split as we weren't overly hungry.  We got the vegetable pappardelle and the BLT. I also ordered an unsweetened iced tea.  30 minutes later our food finally arrived.  The restaurant was only half full so why it took so long is beyond me.  Our server was very nice and attentive.  But something was backing the kitchen up.  Anyway...  When our food came I was extremely impressed with the presentation.  Absolutely beautiful!  The \"pappardelle\" was thinly sliced root veggies that were fried like chips.  They were tasty.   A really nice starter.  The BLT looked amazing, and for $18 it sure needs to!  That may be the most expensive sandwich that I have ordered, ever.  I've lived in NYC, San Francisco, and Chicago.  And even in those food focused and much more expensive cities, I never ordered a sandwich anywhere that was nearly that expensive. And it didn't come with any sides. The bread was thick and looked like toasty goodness.  The bacon was some of the thickest slices that I have very seen.  There was bright bib lettuce, a purple heirloom tomato, a fried egg, and an herbed aioli!  Lifted this glorious sandwich to my mouth preparing for a culinary orgasm!!!.... and tasted.... Nothing.  How, HOW, it is possible to make such a perfect combination of top notch ingredients so bland is beyond me.  I was confused, momentarily fearing that I had lost my sense of taste.  I quickly popped another veggie chip into my mouth to confirm that my taste buds were indeed still functional and took another bite of this picture worthy sandwich and thought \"NO!  How can this be that I taste almost nothing!!!\".  I am still confused by how it is possible to make something so devoid of flavor.  As we were departing the waitress asked if I wanted an iced tea to go, which I thought was a very nice touch.    $33 dollars later for a sandwich and chips I was up and outta there.  To sum it up:  Great decor and presentation.  Friendly wait staff.   Slow kitchen. Very limited menu.  Forgettable food.  Very high prices.  I was really looking forward to trying Little Spoon.  Sadly, I will not be back.",

The sweet potatoes were severely undercooked, and peppered by everyone in the kitchen, and possibly everyone in the dinning room eating(my back was too the entire restaurant, it tasted like this happened.) $11.

Something that would have been helpful prior to ordering since I asked her how it taste before I ordered it. Didn't check on our table until we flagged her down for checks. Then she charged my card twice, didn't say anything. I checked my bank account to find out because I saw her swipe my card twice and didn't feel good about it. She assured me that one will void from my card but I'm not convinced. Especially since I had to go back and ask her why I was charged twice instead of her telling me up front something went wrong. I would not recommend this restaurant to ANYONE. They have a very small menu, no sides, food not prepared well and service sucks. Just save yourself the headache and dine elsewhere.",

    "text": "My fiance and I were looking for a brunch spot for us and another couple and decided on Little Spoon.  We used to live nearby and frequented this location when it was Fabo and have wanted to check the 'new' place out.  I'll detail our experience with the following pros/cons list:  Pros: - Ideal location: right off of Selwyn in the heart of Myers Park - Did not experience a wait, were seated right away - The place was very nicely decorated and had an inviting ambiance about it - While not a typical brunch food item the Korean wings were delicious - The coffee was pretty tasty  Cons: - Poor, inattentive service: waitress was very terse, never asked us how our food was, and didn't keep my coffee warm.  Also, we were asked specifically if we would like some of food items to come out first to which we obliged, however they came after our main dish was served. - The rest of the food was disappointing: the minimalist menu didn't do them any favors as what came out was not what we expected (i.e. all of the egg dishes were cooked with a runny yoke, the granola wasn't what you would traditional think of as granola, and the hash seemed cooked and thrown together as opposed to all cooked together in the same skillet). - I had no idea that the 'out of place' rap lyrics on their website translated to playing hardcore wrap in their restaurant for Sunday brunch.. very strange and didn't fit the vibe at all - Payment comes in the awkward form of using an iPad that the waitress hands you while she stands behind your shoulder (including when entering the tip).  I'm an advocate for technology but this leads to poor service etiquette and an uncomfortable situation.  To top it off the receipt was incorrect as I was charged for an extra dish.  Based on the disparity of cons to pros written above it's safe to state that this experience was a disappointment.  I would like to say that I'd be willing to give it another shot but this single visit was convincing enough to go elsewhere for brunch and otherwise.",

    "text": "My husband and I just came back from brunch here and have decided we will never go back. We got mocha lattes and they were terrible, I honestly couldn't get down the first sip so I told the waitress I didn't like it and could I please have an unsweetened iced tea instead. She never took the mocha latte back so I kinda assumed we'd have to pay for it then. A manager came after we ordered asking if we liked sugar, then proceeded to hand us a plate of toast with sugar/cinn saying \"here's some extra\".. We figured they accidentally made some extra and were giving to us for free. So we said thanks and ate some, it was okay. Our entrees were actually pretty good. My husband got the liver mush and I got the pancetta cornbread dish, both good. The side of bacon was lacking some flavor to us, thick but not too tasty. I asked for an unsweet tea to go, and the waitress came back with a sweet tea. Said that the unsweet was out. You also have to pay on an ipad infront of the waitress so that was awkward for my husband. He ended up barely even looking at it because the waitress was standing right there waiting, so it was only afterwards when I found out we ended up paying $6.50 for the free toast a manager gave us, for 2 mochas (which I figured) and the unsweet tea that I got one drink out of since they ran out. Yeah....We won't be returning.",

The server took it away and cheerfully removed its cost from the bill. Apparently I wasn't the only one to comment and was told they made a new batch for subsequent diners. Appreciated the honesty.   The BTF potatoes were good- might have been better if pieces were smaller but it was tasty. Cheese bites ok- like toasted cheese sandwiches cut up.

Not sure if hip hop is always in the back ground but felt like it might be since a quote from Biggie was on the menu.

If I'd known, I would have ordered something else because I'm not really into large chunks of pork. Just a preference thing. The chicken and biscuits were pretty good. But the dryness of the biscuits took over the amazingness of the chicken. The chicken was spectacular though!  The deviled eggs were pretty good and I liked the 8 minute cookies (some of my party didn't). My hot chocolate was insanely delicious and kept me super warm on a cold day - love that you can spike all your drinks.

Had a regional beer , Bad Penny with a splash of coffee and the server got that right without any questions.   What a cool joint.

Food was pretty good, not great, and service was very slow (it was also a week day). I always try a place twice before I judge it since we all know places can have an off day now and then. However, this morning my boyfriend and I went to brunch and were started off being seated at the very last seat away from the door because we had a dog with us - totally fine, I understand not all people love dogs, but this struck me as slightly odd, because no restaurant has ever done that. Also, want to mention the flies were terrible where we were (not their fault, but added to the poor experience). We ordered two Bloody Mary's that were not great, but were decent - however they were $12 a piece on a Sunday, when most places have specials. I ordered the hash bowl with an over medium egg on top. The egg came out completely cooked through - over hard, not over medium. My food was also luke-warm upon arrival. My boyfriend ordered a chicken sandwich that cost $14 without a side, and the chicken was over cooked, dry, and flavorless. We both agreed it tasted like Wendy's chicken and that he would have been better off ordering it at Chick-Fil-A for $5. We waited for 8+ minutes until the server came and checked on us. By this point, neither of us wanted our food. We told the server what was wrong and that we would just like to get our check and leave. She rudely came back and said that I ordered my egg over-medium, which shouldn't be runny at all. I said I always order it that way and it's always runny. She told me to look it up if I didn't believe her. Even if I was incorrect, as a prior server myself, you never ever tell a customer to look something up. During our time there, we also heard this same server talk rudely to another table and two of the servers drop the F bomb four times next to us about having to set up a table for someone. When we got our check, the manager didn't even come out to see what was wrong. Neither of us have ever sent food back or left a restaurant before, so it was really bad for us to do that. Definitely a very poorly run restaurant and we will absolutely not be back. Would give zero stars if possible.",

I love an innovative brunch but this was too far out there for me. I got the vegetable hash which had good flavor but just wasn't my style; it felt more like a lunch item. We shared the donut holes which were fresh & good but relatively straightforward.   I dunno. Being instructed on \"how\" to use the menu just doesn't seem fitting for brunch. I think this spot just isn't my style. However, I can see why people are intrigued, so if this sounds more appealing to you, by all means go for it!",

Our waitress suggested the sno ball drinks  and the steak and egg plate we pretty much ordered everything she suggested and she didn't steer us in the wrong direction. The steak was so tender and juicy they get a A plus plus for the steak. It was paired with eggs and potatoes and they have a special in house ketchup which i wasn't very keen on it has a very distinctive taste but you know different strokes for different folks. Sno ball drinks were pretty good but after awhile we felt like we were just sipping on flavored water mid way towards the end of the drink. Little spoon is located in the Selwyn area of Charlotte. When im on this side again ill be sure to step back in and try some different dishes and drink of coarse.",

Our waitress also disappeared for long periods of time and then when we had to walk to the host stand to find her, the host didn't even know who our waitress was, seems to me if anyone should know it would be the person who sat us in her section. On top of that a few dishes came out completely cold, they tasted like they had come out of the refrigerator and they forgot to put them in the microwave. Though for the prices that were charged I assumed the food would actually be cooked to order.  Then to top it all off we found glass in our water glasses. I had considered talking to someone at this restaurant regarding this experience but the staff we interacted with made it obvious they could care less about the costumers.

The flavor profile was good on the sauce don't get me wrong, but for $11, I had hoped for more than tortilla chips in sauce. As for the main course I opted for the omelette, and sadly it was quite plain as well. I could have made a better one at home for less. It was just, plain, with not much flavor to go with at at all.

Then, it happened, my food was presented... the honey was on the side but there was 3 drops in the condiment dish at best. I said \"thank you, but could I please have more honey?\" At this point the server had walked off and I heard a faint \"um, hmm\" she barely acknowledge my request, no eye contact (as I didn't know if that response was to me). But she did have time to stop at the next table to chop it up and giggle. I let her finish her socializing with the next table and again \"Excuse me...\" and before I could say anything else she was half-way back in side, but turned to me and said, verbatim \"I heard you.\" At this point you are just being blatantly RUDE, and for what??? I said nothing, she continued \"isn't that what you wanted? Huh?\" Mind you this is all from her half-way back inside, yelling across the other table she just acknowledged. I just gathered my things as she stared at me, and left. I have never experienced this low-level of service at Little Spoon, but I will not be disrespected PERIODT.

    "text": "Ate lunch here last week. Had the egg, cheese and sausage sandwich. Very good. My friend had the special, chicken salad on some sort of bread. Salad was also very good, but the bread was too crumbly, making the sandwich hard to eat.  The restaurant has nice ambiance. Parking can be a bit of a challenge. Seems like they have been working on that parking deck for years.  The service was meh. Our waitress seemed to have an attitude problem. This was our first time in , so we asked a few questions. After we placed our order, my friend leans in to say, \"I think she thinks they are doing us a favor by letting us eat here.\"  The other issue was the music. Way too loud for a conversation. We asked it to be turned down a notch, but were told, \"The manager won't let us.\" More likely, the staff likes it that way. If you want to have a nice conversation, eat outside or go elsewhare.  Probably give this place another shot, if I'm in the area, but hey, Reids is right across the street and has great sandwiches.",

Food was great though, I had the hash with a medium egg on top. First time eating purple potatoes and the dish was great! Some in my party had the burger, which had thickk slices of bacon and was served on a housemade donut bun. I think it may have been a special that day.. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Although I made reservations for our party several days in advance, they were able to accommodate the additional 3 people that joined us at the last minute.  Also, we sat outside, on a day that was more chilly than most during the week, and they had heaters on outside, which was great, except the wind overpowered the flames. Something to keep in mind if you consider eating outside on a not-so-nice day.  Last but not least - the music! Loved it!! They had Pandora on a hip hop station which worked great for us, made the ambience that much nicer. Although I realize this may not tickle everyone's fancy, made our day. I would definitely come back, had a great experience overall.",

She did not even go ask for more information. I asked other staff, including the hostess, and they would not help me either saying that wasn't their job. When I pressed on with the waitress, she asked me about ingredients by naming them in Spanish... I don't speak Spanish. We waited 70 minutes for a table they said would take 40 minutes and it WAS NOT WORTH IT. Overall, a terrible experience and a huge let down on a birthday with friends.",

They throw in every acronym they can think of and lowercase letters mixed in with some hashtag symbols so you think it's something super cool but really it's just regular potato hash. You can't trick people by NOT having air-conditioning in 80 degree weather and wobbly wooden tables and throw in some early 90s rap music under the guise of being Eco-friendly and hip and then charge over $12 for 3 bites of food in each entree. Even the staff was pretentious. Since the menu was confusing, I asked the waitress if they had any pancakes just to make sure. Instead of just saying a simple \"no\", she passively aggressively told me that if I wanted that there was a nice place down the street. Anyways, if you're going to charge $60 for mediocre tasting brunch, at least have air conditioning. Little Spoon is like that kid in high school who tries way too hard to be cool and can't quite get there.",

I also liked that they all have tablets, so your order is immediately sent to the kitchen and, if you're paying with a card, they can swipe it at the table  That said, the price, especially for the portion sizes, is ridiculous.  The hash was good, but for $13, all I got was a relatively small plate and one measly fried egg. The Chai was sizeable, but at $4, it should be. The most ridiculous thing I saw was coke/diet coke for $3.50...most restaurants charge around $2.50 and that's a rip-off; $3.50 is highway robbery.",

For food - 3.5 I got the grits with braised rabbit which our waitress and girl who brought our dishes said was their favorite on the menu. It was underwhelming. I described it to friends as a gritty chicken and dumplings minus the dumplings and replaced chicken with rabbit.   My friend got the BLT - It's super thick bacon that was half fat - almost like a short rib. The bread, garlic aioli and tomatoes were excellent.    Service - 2.5 I asked for a chai tea latte to go. Soy is not available but they offered coconut water. The drink tasted like flavored water. Upon asking to make it stronger - I was told \"they make it in house and I'm probably used to the syrup most places use\". Making something in house should make it better - not worse. I prefer \"in-house\" made chai tea drinks to syrup...customers are not always right here.   Another friend mentioned they won't substitute or split things.  Also not a fan of the iPad's they use for checks, it's uncomfortable to ask you to decide the tip while your waitress is holding the screen. Difficult to review your bill as well.  All said - I would probably go back for the vibes and avoid recommendations and the coffee bar.",

    "text": "I had a latte and egg sandwich which tasted fine, but the rest of my experience left a lot of room for improvement.      Most importantly, when I asked for the check, my waitress came to the table with a hand held tablet and verbally announced my total bill to the room.  I wasn't shown an itemized bill ( so zero opportunity to make sure I had been billed correctly) and the waitress stood next to me while I had to quickly decide what tip to add (since the preprogrammed tip options started at 18%, I had to write in the amount I wanted to tip) as she waited for me to sign & return the tablet to her.      When I asked for a printed receipt, my waitress had to go ask for help, though eventually she brought me a paper receipt.     Other gripes: When I arrived I was the only patron. When the next customers arrived, they were seated at the table next to me. Really? With an entirely empty restaurant, you couldn't space out the guests a little for privacy?     I ordered a latte which arrived in a sizable bowl. No cup handle. So my choice was pick it up (requiring both hands) and burn my fingers on the too hot ceramic or wait till for the coffee to get cold.     My waitress did not ask if if I needed sugar. I had to ask for it. She did the same thing to the next customers ( though fortunately I was close enough to hear they needed sugar - and just handed them mine!)     The menu is a bit odd. My egg sandwich was fine and properly cooked to my liking but for $9.00 I thought it could have been served with a little hash browns or fruit garnish or something. No, just the egg sandwich alone on a plate without so much as a piece of parsley.    In short, the restaurant may be stylish & high tech, but doesn't translate to a happy customer experience.  I won't be back.",

I mean, I don't think 7:30 on a weekday is all that early. We bagged it and went to Amelie's - which is awesome as always.   My wife warned me the place was disappointing. I guess I'll never know unless I quit my job and roll out of bed after 8 to go there.",

    "text": "So I had high hopes for Little Spoon but they were just that honestly... high hopes.  I don't understand how this place was so busy with mediocre food?! I didn't get any alcohol so maybe that is the draw; because I know I personally make better brunch food myself than Little Spoon.   That is a bold statement to make but I feel that strongly about the lack of flavor and creativity in their brunch. The service was good though but the wait was long!! I even over heard a waiter apologizing for the mix up and wait with other customers.   We sat down and had a bacon egg and cheese biscuit and sausage egg and cheese. Something simple but should be good. With the photos of this place I was so excited when in saw the bacon. When I ate the bacon I realized it had no flavor and majority fat in it!!  The cheese was bland and tasted slight old and the biscuits at bojanles are better than this place.   Maybe I order the wrong thing and they have a staple dish that will blow my mind away? I can't see myself rushing back to find out what that dish is or spend more than five minute wait to taste mediocre food.   There is a reason why this place has so many mixed reviews. Get back to the basics and serve better food... I will not be rushing here any time soon with a lot of really good places in Charlotte.",

I came from the backdoor and because of that I didn't really get a greeting. I had to walk to the front and then get seated.   They had a long menu with no pictures so of course it was a little hard for me to choose a dish, but I ended up choosing Chipotle chili, korean brussels, and cinnamon toast brulee. The korean brussels had a lot of flavor going on so it wasn't the best to me. Their chili was pretty good but it is a small portion. The toast was alright.   Overall, the place was okay. Nothing really stood out to me and the food just didn't WOW me.",

Menu has a lot of unique options outside of your traditional omelette. The goat cheese and chive biscuits were good. My friend and I were surprised when they came out though. They are more like mini bite sized dinner rolls. The goat cheese and chive is not a spread, I think it's used in how they make them.   Drinks were good! The Bloody Mary was made with a homemade mix. I ordered the mimosa with berries , limoncello and mint. Be prepared for there to be a layer of berry seeds floating on the top. If you're on a date, be careful - you probably don't want berry seeds stuck in your teeth.  Porchetta - filling and a nice option for those wanting to try something different. Cornbread was delicious!",

    "text": "I, like a previous reviewer, agree that the food is somewhat lacking in flavor. I came on a Sunday for lunch around 12:30pm. After a bit of a wait, we probably got sat 30-40 mins later. They were obviously very busy. The staff was accommodating and friendly. It took our server a little while to come over to us once we got sat, but she immediately apologized for the delay and thanked us for our patience. I ordered a caramel latte and the Egg White Raft for my meal. The latte was perfect. The Egg White Raft was boring. Egg white omelet with zero seasoning on top of raw swiss chard that layed on a piece of sourdough bread. There was a thin layer of whipped goat cheese on the bread which was good, but they could have put more on. Now that I'm looking at the menu I realize that they forgot to add the salsa verde to my dish. That may have helped with the flavor. It was edible, but like I said, boring. The servers were really nice and the ambience was good. I'll come back and try something else next time!",

    "text": "My last day in Charlotte and of course I had to do brunch with the family and my bestie. My mother wanted to try something new- Lil Spoon appeared to have  options outside of your traditional grits and eggs.    The location is in the same center as Mellow Mushroom. There is parking  at the back of the building.  The area is a little congested,  and I can see it being problematic if there are a lot of patrons at the center.   I went in ahead of my group to see how long the wait was. We arrived around 12:30 or so, and my party of 5 was immediately able to be seated. The staff was extremely accommodating. I advised that my 98 year old granny  was in my party and they allowed us to come in through the back door. As we were entering a staff member was headed out and even held the door for us. Once in, our table was already set up for us, and we did not have to go far with granny. Big kudos for this!!   Our wait staff was Anne. She was sweet and even  mentioned that my granny made her think of her grandmother whom she had not seen in a number of years.   We were provided with a container of water for the table, I always love this idea.  No need to keep coming back to the table to refill cups of water!  I also ordered the caramel latte with coconut milk. As a starter the table shared the deviled eggs. You get 5 deviled eggs, which was perfect for our group.   We also ordered the French toast, the hashed and the SEC. the French toast was the winner of all of the items we tried.   My mother and bestie both had the hashed, both agreed they would not re- order. They felt in needed additional flavor. The SEC was basically a chicken sausage egg and cheese sandwich. I enjoyed it, but would likely try something else on my return. I almost forgot to mention, they also accommodated my mother splitting her hashed with my granny.  It came out in two dishes, already separated--- NICE!!   I would love to come back to try  other menu options.  I like the fact that they have selections to cover a variety of dietary plans.  They also have a decent selection of coffee drinks and even offer alcoholic shots as add ins!!    If you are looking for a quaint spot for brunch- look no further! Not only will you be impressed with the food, but the service will exceed your expectations. ... oh yeah, the music played in the background was a  score, think old school hip hip!",

Our waitress was great and helped us decide what items to try being that it was out first time. When I asked about dinner she informed us that they open for dinner on Thursday nights and that the menu changes. I thought that was really cool! She also shared that they are opening a restaurant in Plaza Midwood and I am exited to give that a try too! Do yourself a favor and come here for brunch! You won't regret it!",

Got the bacon egg sandwich, buns burnt on one side, slab bacon not edible , egg way over cooked. Also got chicken lettuce cups with creamy cole slaw . Cold slaw was basically some large shreds of carrot and cabbage . Not creamy. Chicken was dry , lettuce tasted old.   Patio was fun, service was good .",

The flavorful juice on the bottom of the bowl creates a not too soggy texture on the bottom of the ciabatta toast that's spread with salt pepper garlic butter. Topped with crunchy arugula, shrimp sauteed perfectly and don't forget a sunny side up egg to top it all off. Incredible!!!! And slab bacon and Korean Brussel sprouts.",

The place is quite small, so the seating is intimate so don't expect a lot of elbow room.  The staff is friendly; however they had hip hop blaring which came across like they were trying to be too hip.  Hearing DMX that time of the morning lends it more for evening drinks than a relaxing breakfast.  The food was eclectic, and not your typical breakfast fare.  We started with cinnamon toast and blueberry pop tarts.  The pop tart was delicious; however the toast was nothing you couldn't make at home.  My food was good. I had a small boule sandwich which included a runny egg, slab bacon and cheddar cheese. But it was $16 and the size of my palm. However my wife and mother-in-law found their chicken baguette and grits special quite bland.   My biggest concern about this place is value. The food wasn't worth it given the big prices, the small portions and the mediocre taste and presentation.  The place could reach it's potential with smaller prices, larger portions and greater tastes.",

We had the porridge, which was quite nice.. the shushuka, which was a bit too tomato-ey, and the turkey sandwich which I personally was not a fan of because the turkey came in thick slabs, while I was expecting something quite different. The customer service however, is what really made the experience a not-so-worthwhile one. We sat outdoors to enjoy the beautiful morning, but it was all very quickly destroyed by the very loud 90's hip hop music on the speaker right above our heads. You expect to yell and talk to people at a nightclub, not so much at a Sunday brunch when they're sitting at the same table as you.. After repeated requests from us, and the tables around us, the volume remained unchanged. Apparently the staff there isn't allowed to adjust the volume? Saving grace was that the music was pretty good... but I still left with a headache.",

It had braised rabbit, but the rabbit was the texture of 10-min boiled chicken with no flavor, instead of 45-min plus \"braised\" rabbit meat; therefore, it was not tender.  The only flavor you get was from the tomato puree that was poured on top of this dish.   The actual grits were undercooked - al dente grits??   Drinks:  Mimosa- On Point!",

Our mistake came in our food choice, we both ordered the Shashuka. First, it was spicy, which our server didn't mention when I asked her about the dish. I can move past that. when I poked my eggs with my fork, I noticed that they weren't even cooked, the whites were still translucent. I'm not a huge fan of runny yolks, but I absolutely can't stomach runny whites. We probably will return at some point to try a less risky dish, but overall, our first trip was a waste of $30.",

    "text": "Excellent ambience from the decor to the James Brown playing. Service was also great. Great crowd even at 2pm on a Saturday. Both my wife and I thought the menu was a little too abstract. The waitress had to explain - this is a salad, this is a sandwich. We both ordered the burger and it was delicious, although a tad pricey at $14 (and no sides). We ordered a side of some fried veggies and we both found those entirely too salty...couldn't finish the bag. I think they have the makings for a great little restaurant with some menu and price refinements. The other down side is that we left feeling greasy...not sure if it was the fried veggies or the burger. I look forward to trying more menu options and increasing my rating to a 4.   Two months later...I did return with my parents for breakfast and sadly, we won't be back. The food just isn't hitting the spot and it's entirely over priced. Portion sizes are ridiculously small, bacon is too thick, cinnamon toast was peppered with coarse sugar, coffee bowls are lame...Change the menu and prices and we'll back. We used to go to Fabu on the regular but we can't swing your Manhattan prices.",

    "text": "I recently read an article stating that little spoon was one of the best brunch places in Charlotte, being an avid lover of all things breakfast I decided to try. I'm a culinary student and I was very disappointed. I really want to open my own farm to table restaurant but I want to actually give the food flavor. The atmosphere was awesome. I went with a friend after church on Sunday, we ordered a latte and an Americano, both were really good. We then ordered the starters of the donut holes and the potatoes. I was really pleased with the display but for $6 you get 3 donut holes that taste very similar to day old Dunkin, not the best. The potatoes were the only thing I ordered that I really liked, the garlic aioli set it off and the potatoes were purple so that made things festive. For our entrees she ordered the Breakfast sandwich with their version of bacon and after trying hers I really liked it, not a fan of fat but you have to expect that from pork belly bacon. They didn't offer sides, the sides were the starters. I was really wanting a delicious burger, because that's what people raved about, but no burger was even on the menu and when I asked the waitress the specials she said there were none, but later I watched them deliver a burger to someone, sad. Instead I ordered the chicken biscuits. Being from North Carolina the thing that really made me want them aside from the homemade pickles was the chicken soaked in cheer wine, but to my dismay they tasted nothing like cheer wine, not even a little. And the biscuit part was the real disappointment...I got over everything else but this...the biscuit was disgusting. It was very dry and all the give you on the plate and biscuit is aioli, which was great but did not help at all. I ordered an over medium egg on the side (for an extra $2 which is what you could get 12 eggs for) and it didn't even help moisten the biscuit, so I ended up leaving the overdone, crumbly, flavorless biscuits on the plate and ate the chicken and egg. All in all I give this place 2 stars sadly because I was really looking forward to it and I was so disappointed.",

Plenty of open tables outside and hostess seats us at the one right in front of the door. Really?? You put us at the worst table in the whole place. The table was also broken. We ask to move to a different table.   We order coffees and then offered 100 options for creamer...coconut milk is bit of an overkill don't you think? They bring out bowls of coffee. No, not mugs but bowls with no handles...what is this place??    What continues is the $13 BLT on the menu. I'm sorry I don't care how good you bacon or tomatoes are that you bought down the street from Joe the farmer but $13 is a bit ridiculous. I ordered the hash also $13. It was just ok. Very oily and my over medium egg was hard as a rock. I get all the details and I usually appreciate them but the food has to be the star of the show.    Lastly the iPads....connection issues to start and I get you want to be tech-savvy and eco friendly but please don't have your waitresses wait holding the iPad while your customers tries to pay (with cash) and sort out the tip. It's just awkward. Either leave them with the table or don't use them. Plenty of San Fran restaurants have them as menus too and they aren't waiting for you to steal them. You have to get over that if you want to use them.   Unfortunately, I'm not sure we'll be back. I'm all for farm to table restaurants but breakfast/brunch is simple and not over complicated. This place is over complicated. It's trying to be everything and just hasn't found its identity yet. Good luck!",

I was able to grab a coffee (which was excellent) at the coffee bar to drink while we waited and had free refills of the coffee throughout brunch. My only issue was that the coffee mugs had no handles! Was a little hot to hold.   The atmosphere is very modern but charming -- with lots of clever touches. We ordered the cinnamon brioche toast to start and it was melt in your mouth. Definitely recommend! I had the breakfast quinoa with blueberries and walnuts to start and it was yummy and comforting and still vaguely healthy! Can't complain about that. My boyfriend had their daily special (goat cheese grits, succotash, lamb chorizo and more) and raved about it.   Service was friendly and we will definitely be back!

The menu was limited to a few selections that all sound really great on paper. One interesting item was the cinnamon sugar toast, but for some reason it doesn't have much taste. Maybe it needs more butter. The breakfast sandwich we got was pretty good, but it was very greasy and the bacon was really undercooked.   The prices are a little bit high here and the environment is kind of cramped for what you get. Reading the menu was the most delicious part.",

Plenty of customers bobbing their head to the bass while ordering/eating.    FOOD: First single off my most recent album \"Bass & Brunch\" DJ, drop that beat... Got the Chicken Biscuit. Garlic aioli to dip it. On the side. I like the extra \"oomf\", no lie (no lie). Not a big enough serving to get me full, but enough to satisfy.  Why they call it \"Little\" Spoon? Wish it was more B-I-G. Though the fried chicken was tender and pretty tasty. Not the biggest pieces for the price. Without the biscuits, the chicken could be finished in two bites.  Overall it was solid, and I'm glad I came through. Just wish the biscuits were more moist and more flavorful too. Brunch life (brunch life!). *Drop the mic*  SERVICE: Good service and fast for a busy morning. Our waiter kept coming back to fill our waters and to check up on us.  IMPRESSIONS: I'm a fan of the concept. I enjoy hip hop music and brunch food. Together? Why not! At the minimum, I really wish the portions were a bit bigger. Also, the bathroom was a kind of dirty and that gave me the shivers.  I assume this place is kid-friendly. I didn't hear any \"bad words\" come on the tracks, nor did I see any \"parental advisory\" signs in this joint.",

    "text": "First time here, and after reading all my fellow Elite reviews, I just had to check it out! Took my GF Michelle there on a Sunday afternoon for brunch, and this is the location where Fabo used to be located. Thankfully an enterprising West Coast transplant created this cool hip-hop LA Vibe-y place called Little Spoon.  Now all this \"vibe\" would be lost IF the food suck. And the food did not suck! In fact, the food and service were AWESOME!   This place looks nothing like Fabo, thankfully. It's definitely got that West Coast vibe to it, and there hip-hop music blaring (OK, I admit to not being a huge hip-hop fan but I agree that it's better than Lawrence Welk....barely)....  Menu is small but packs a wallup! For starters we opted for the Cinnamon Toast Brulee, which basically was a piece of buttery brioche toped with coars sugar and cinnamon, and torched to get great carmelization. This was divine! No syrup required!  Note that this place is basically Tapas style in that sharing is what it's all about. So we ordered the Shashuka, which was a VERY SPICY dish! We were warned, and since we both love spicy, we loved it! Just know that this will light up your taste buds as the sauce contains some hot peppers....YUM! But with that was a savory egg, parsnip and fennel.   We also got the Chicken Biscuit which had super moist and juicy fried chicken, which was heavenly! That garlic aioli was killer! Finally ordered the Jerk Chicken lettuce cups, which had of course pulled jerk chicken and a creamy slaw inside a lettuce wrap. This was as refreshing as it was satisfying.  Our waitress Sherydan was super friendly, efficient and excellent at making recommendations!  Can't wait to come back! A super welcome addition to the already awesome neighborhood!  HIGHLY Recommended!",

The music was a little too loud because it interfered with conversation and communication with the servers.  Coffee was good. Mimosas were alright. Our carafe was a bit heavy with the champagne. Which is better than the alternative.  DoNut app was good. The meal I ordered however was disappointing.  I ordered Menage which is grits, potato puree, coddled eggs, and toast. The eggs, grits, and puree were served in two cups. One cup was great, perfectly prepared and seasoned. The other was under done, lumpy, and underseasoned. The bacon was great. I just feel if your going to do small trendy plates, you need to nail the execution and they didn't.",

    "text": "This was our second time having Sunday brunch at this restaurant. First time around I loved their cappuccinos and the overall experience left us wanting to explore more things on the menu.  Coming in, we were told that there will be a 30 minute wait. It turned out to be an hour and ten minute wait, and two parties waiting in line before us left. Ordered chicken biscuits as an appetizer, they were dry, and the chicken to biscuit ratio is definitely off. Also had Korean Brussels, which were decent. As an entree, I ordered the sticky rice. It was underwhelming. Pulled pork on top was lacking flavor - my 9 months old enjoyed it though, no wonder - it tastes more like baby food. And the kicker - my husband ordered a burger, and on his last bite he found a hair in it. The whole meal was ruined. I genuinely feel like this is basic sanitary issue, and if you're made to wait over an hour for food, it should at least be prepared in a clean environment. This was the last time we went here. Have to give them credit for taking off the burger and our drinks off the bill, but it doesn't even begin to make up for a ruined Sunday morning.",

    "text": "The fella and I ventured in on the first Sunday they were open, which made me a little nervous, but I didn't need to be. They open at 9:00, and when we got there at 8:50, there were already people inside. Turns out the kitchen doesn't open til 9:00, but they let in the early birds for coffee while you wait. So nice!  I love how they transformed it from when it was FABO - exposed brick, dark wood tables, beautiful hutch over the coffee bar, open kitchen window, clear globes over the warm hanging lights. There are some tables outside, and a few in the front and back of the restaurant, but the bulk is one, long bench along the wall with individual tables, so we quickly got to know our neighbors.  Our waitress was so nice and helpful, explaining the menu and checking in just the right amount of times. The menu was broken up into appetizers, sandwiches, fork and knife, and sides. It's definitely not your \"traditional\" menu, and I wondered how the many families with kids in there were doing with such grown-up fare.  The fella got the Hot Pocket, which looked like a calzone and was filled with scrambled eggs, ham, and a creamy sauce, and a Slab of Bacon side. He loved the Hot Pocket but said it needed \"more stuff,\" and although the bacon was his favorite, it tasted too much like pork for me. I got the Pop Tart (homemade dough filled with three different types of fruit jam), and the Cinnamon Toast Brulee, which was deeeelicious. It was two slices of thick bread that had bruleed cinnamon sugar on top.  The most impressive part? The coffee. It comes in a cup (vat?) so big there's not even a handle and you need both hands to drink it. It's bold and dark and fantastic. Mmmmm.  Breakfast was a little pricey - all that cost us $37 - so littleSpoon isn't somewhere we'd come all the time, but it'll be a nice treat when we do go back!",

Charlotte could use more restaurants like Little Spoon to break up some of the stuffyness thats around. The environment was very hip and the music was boppin'.   I have been to a few farm to table restaurants in the Charlotte area lately and they are definitely one of the most legitimate sourcing the foods from North Carolina and South Carolina.   I had the following:   Chicken and gravy biscuits. They were delicious. (This is coming from someone born and raised in NC) I will say they were not the traditional gravy and biscuits but boy did they have a mouthwatering twist.   The bacon was spot on. Yes it is a little thicker than your typical bacon but it was AMAZING!   The coffee does come in a mug basically the size of a bowl but if you're a coffee lover like me who doesn't want a bowl of coffee?   My boyfriend had the donut burger and it was so good he finished it by the time I was half way through my FIRST biscuit.   The service was great, friendly, and attentive!   Yes it is a little odd to tip the person on the iPad but if you are embarrassed to tip in front of them then maybe you are being a little stingy. Also, I saw a couple come in 5 minutes until close and they welcomed the customers with open arms.   I will be back little spoon and I'll need a bigger spoon next time ;)",

The hash was a disappointment all-around, as the potatoes were grossly undercooked/raw, and the sausage and peppers were too greasy. There are much better options in the area for less than the $50 we spent.",

It was basically a soup of tomato paste with an egg on top. No flavor at all... We both had coffees and we tried the house bacon. Don't expect a crispy bacon, it's just a chunk of pork.

    "text": "I am always excited when new places open up in the QC, as there is always a possibility for them to be great. I had a rare chance for a weekday lunch date and it just worked out for the wife to join me on this day. Little Spoon has not been open for long and I really only became aware of it from the most recent QC exclusive magazine.  Little Spoon is tucked away in the same building as Mellow Mushroom on Selwyn. It was a little bit of a challenge to find the entrance, but from now on I know exactly where to go. I was waiting for the wife to meet me, and I was starving so I ordered the heirloom tomato salad. Now the menu, as others have mentioned, is tiny with only 2 salad options and 3 sandwiched on this day. There were also a few side options and drinks to include a full coffee menu.   The heirloom tomato salad was great with the freshest ingredients possible. It was also plentiful, but I still ordered the lamb pastrami sandwich later when the wife finally arrived. She got the shrimp sandwich and we split a side of couscous. My americano was good, but not great. Service was good and attentive, but overall on the slower side. We definitely did not feel rushed out of there. I sat just opposite the kitchen and could see them working. It looked like every dish was completely made to order, so I can appreciate that it may not be a quick lunch place if you are in a rush. One other slight negative was how cramped the tables were next to each other.   All in all, the food was great in flavor, the small menu was not a problem for us, but the table set up and speed of service were the main issues. It seems like a lot of people are taken aback by the small menu. If everything is good that should not be a problem. I am not sure if the kitchen size is limiting the menu, but that may be their biggest problem long term based on the other reviews on yelp regarding the breakfast and lunch menus. We will definitely be returning.",

My mom ordered a coffee, cinnamon toast, and we shared a side of bacon (aka pork bellies). She loved the coffee and the cinnamon toast - I stole a bite too and the toast was pretty delicious. But we both agreed the pork bellies left something to be desired. They weren't seasoned very well and only the very ends were really cooked through/rendered enough on the outside. I ended up ordering the SEC breakfast sandwich and I thought it was really good - the breakfast sausage definitely beats the bacon here, and I'm a sucker for a runny yolk. It was a tad bread heavy though, so I ended up eating it as an open-face sandwich with just the bottom piece.   I would consider giving them another try, but overall it's far from my favorite spot and the pricing seemed high for toast and breakfast sandwiches.",

Puts me in a fabulous mood to get wasted later. Customer service was great. She was on point! Again, those who have read my past reviews. Customer service is very important on my list..  My girls ordered: grits and pork belly bacon, wings, egg white breakfast sandwiches, cronuts and I ordered the shrimp Raft! I like the Shrimp Raft. Very tasty. The bagel I think sits in the middle of the bowl, then it's fills with sauce, shrimp and arugula! Awesome to me! Wings have a kick. Those whose a fan of spicy and a little kick in their food. These are great. I didn't care of it.. I also tried the cronuts. I couldn't understand the hype.. It's definitely fried and believe me, I am a fan of fried food. But I didn't care for these. I think it's greasy. I can taste the grease.. Nothing impressive. Won't order that again. But overall, I would love to come back and try a few more dishes. Nice brunch/lunch hangout that you can get breakfast anytime and with a nice day.. I can almost feel like I'm on vacation... ALMOST!",

A duration the food simply cannot justify... sorry this one to avoid.",

I love places that have different things and the items on their menu sounded really good and more unique than other restaurants around the area.   I was most excited for the Shashuka. While the menu lists a couple of the ingredients in the dish, it tasted like eggs with tomato sauce. There wasn't much of a kick to the dish and it was pretty boring. The steak sandwich (I forgot the name on the menu) was also not what I was expecting. The meat was pretty dry, and it comes with a sauce. The sauce, that I assume is for dipping, was watery and had no taste to it. I was impressed with the cinnamon toast brulee though. It was quite tasty so I recommend that if you go here!  Overall, the place is alright. I don't think I will be going back anytime soon, especially since it is on the pricey side. It's cute on the inside though.",

It was good but a little spicy for my total lame taste buds. Husband assures me it wasn't spicy if you're anyone but me ;-)  We also ordered the donuts and the side of bacon. The donuts were good but not good enough to order again. Very sweet. The bacon was fantastic. Husband has not shut up about it and we are a couple weeks out from this meal.  He had the bloody mar. I had the mimosa. They were $10-11 each, the mimosa was very small and they were both just ok. I think next time I'd just enjoy coffee or order a more interesting drink for those prices.  Waitress was a doll, suggesting menu items and quick with refills, etc.  Patio was delightful. Will definitely be back.",

We had a business lunch here on a Saturday morning and had to wait an hour for a table (typical wait since weekends are crazy). Food was pretty good as were drinks. We ordered the hot chocolate, chai tea, and sparkling lemonade. Chai Tea was some of the most authentic I've tasted in a while, although as we ended the meal, it did get a bitter taste. Donuts were nothing special but the brussel sprouts, BTF (basically fancy homefries), and bacon were delicious. It's not an \"amazing\" brunch place but definitely a good one and we'll be back!",

If I did not have \"server hands\" myself, I would have burned them trying to pick up the darn thing. BEC on a burger bun. Yes, a frickin burger bun. $9.  Yes, $9 for a BEC on a burger bun. The bacon was actually pork belly.  It was very tough for pork belly.  The dishes, glasses and silverware were speckled with food particles like they were not changing the water in the dishwasher frequently enough (commercial washers use the same water over and over but it needs changing regularly). There was a cell phone on the expo counter.  Cell phones are frequently used to pass the time while passing your last meal, if you catch my drift.  Poop!!! The food expo guy shook hands with a customer and went straight back to handling plates of food without washing his hands.  I asked for the WiFi password but the waitress forgot to tell me.  Servers should have it memorized. A customer asked a waitress to stand in a high stool and take a picture of him and his food, in a to go box?  What?! The old skool rap and hip hop was kinda nostalgic but it was so loud I'm now deaf.  It was really loud. The waitress did not mention the specials. They make you pay at the table on a tablet.  It's uncomfortable to be forced to complete your transaction with the waitress just standing there holding a screen in your face. The expo delivered my food and asked if I needed anything and forgot to bring/send the hot sauce I requested.  This was either May 21st or 22nd.",

The menu features mainly dishes that are quite eccentric and abnormal, but nonetheless delicious. Most if not if not all of the ingredients the restaurant uses are sourced locally. There is even a chalkboard in the restaurant that colorfully lists the farms the restaurant works with and utilizes. The restaurant is on the small side, although there's outdoor seating, there isn't ample space so there may be a wait at peak hours. But this eatery is definitely a must-go, especially for those who appreciate an enjoyably funky dining experience.",

The food was above average but not amazing, and the service was solid.  As others have mentioned, I really like the 90's hip hop music and the laid back vibe of the restaurant, even down to the menu! The waitstaff all seemed very chill but not too laid back to be inattentive, and our food came out pretty quickly after we ordered. I ordered the shashuka, which consists of two eggs in a spicy marinara sauce with toasted bread. It was pretty tasty, but I would have liked a lot more bread. I got three small triangles, and the tomato sauce and runny eggs seemed too much like a soup without anything to dip. My girlfriend got the chicken biscuit, which actually comes as two sliders. The biscuits were fluffy and tender, and the chicken pieces were tasty, although a bit small. The pickled cucumbers and dip/spread on the side (some type of aioli possibly) both added great flavor too. We tried the 8 minute cookies as a dessert...avoid these! They weren't horrible, but they weren't even as good as store-bought cookie dough and were only 4 very small cookies for $6. Overall, the food was solid, albeit a bit lacking for the price, but I'd be willing to come back here.",

I ordered the grits entree and the sauce it was topped with was so acidic and vinegary I could barely eat it.   The grits themselves were okay but all the nonsense around them were not good at all.  The biscuit I ordered was also very dry and tasted a bit stale; wasn't fresh at all.  Now I didn't expect it to come fresh out of the oven, but the thing was practically cold.    The only highlights were the chai latte with coconut milk I ordered and the blackberry jam that I topped the biscuit.  Both were superb.  I also have to give it to them on the atmosphere--the place itself is set up very nicely and although I was a bit surprised by the choice of music.  Overall, I won't be going back; I'll make my grits at home and save the $14 it costs to eat them here.",

An item such as cinnamon toast costs half as much as sandwiches but the portion is over twice as large.  I understand ingredient pricing varies and drives up the cost, but the difference is disparaging.  I like the food, but Little Spoon is trying to be too clever, too clever that on our first visit their computer system was down and they were unable to even take orders with pen and paper...so we weren't served.  I think Little Spoon has great potential with some tweaks on menu pricing, portions, and table service.  (I am not sure if Little Spoon prides their ingredients on local sourcing, if  they do, it is not apparent from the menu)",
