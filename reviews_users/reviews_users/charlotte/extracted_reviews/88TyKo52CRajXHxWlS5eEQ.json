    "text": "I gave this place a 3 mainly because of the price. 3 crepes and three drinks, 1 being a water, came to $31 for lunch. EEEEK!!!!!  I had the Mediterranean crepe. It consisted of cubed chix, roasted red peppers, banana peppers cheese and some other salty items. It was not very good. Because the chicken was cubed, it kept falling out of the crepe and the salty, pickled items overpowered the entire crepe.   My son got the Gyro crepe. It was very tasty but it was also obvious that the Gyro meat was originally frozen. Still the overall taste was really good. My son loved it and when it comes down to it, that's all that matters.  My daughter had the strawberries, Nutella and whipped cream crepe. Yes I know, I allowed her to have a dessert crepe for lunch, don't judge! This crepe was my favorite. Aside from the mess, the crepe was beyond delicious. Lots of strawberries, lots of Nutella and lots of whipped cream. It was definitely the favorite among all of us at the table.  The atmosphere was fine and they offer free WiFi which is very nice.",

    "text": "Wow! I am wholly impressed with Royal Cafe & Creperie, and they just opened two and a half months ago!  It might sound crazy, but I have never had a good crepe until today. I needed some breakfast, and I came across this new place. After seeing the high Yelp scores, I decided to stop in.   I ordered the Crepe Florentine, and it was fantastic. The crepe was done to perfection, and the fillings were very fresh. It contained the perfect balance of cheese, onion, spinach and mushroom.   To my delight, Royal Cafe serves tea from TeaRex. I wish more restaurants in Charlotte could and would partner with TeaRex. When restaurants serve high quality tea, especially from local purveyors, I know they truly care about the food they serve. I ordered my favorite, Earl Grey.  The woman who helped me today appears to be one of the owners. She was very friendly and helpful to this first-time visitor. She extended her positive greeting to all who visited while I dined.  I know the place is still new, but I wish to make two suggestions for improvement.   1. The paper plates and plastic utensils just don't jibe with the rest of the experience presented at Royal Cafe. The food is so good and of such high quality, it feels a little odd to be eating it on paper plates. Perhaps one day they'll upgrade.  2. Royal Cafe is guilty of one of my big brick & mortar no-no's. They had a live radio station playing over the sound system in the restaurant. This is one of my biggest pet-peeves. Poor music choice is distracting enough as it is, but to add in advertisements and chatter is so wrong. I hope it's something they will consider changing in the very near future. They've shown so much attention to detail and quality through the decor, service, and food; they need to extend it to the in-house music (and the plates).  ^ Incidentally, I am so enamored with this place, I just can't deduct a star for either of these. The rest of it was absolutely perfect. I highly recommend Royal Cafe & Creperie!",

There are a lot of choices of different crepes you can order and if you don't like any of the combos that are listed on the menu, you can make your own crepe.  I got a breakfast crepe with avocados - I forget the name on the menu and it was delicious.  My only complaint was that it was so big, I couldn't finish it and crepes don't hold up well so I had to throw out the leftovers.  The prices are pretty steep for crepes IMO, but I guess that's why they are so big.  If I go back, I will make sure to split my crepe next time.",

    "text": "We came here one day after opening day - we were so excited to have a creperie nearby!  Our excitement was not disappointed: The experience was great in every way.  The crepes are delicious, and really big and stuffed with lots of good food. Substitutions are no problem. Prices are more than reasonable (6-7 dollars for a crepe). We tried a breakfast crepe, a savory crepe and a sweet crepe, and I can recommend them all. Delicious Nutella makes the dessert crepes all the better!  We talked to the owners a bit - it sounds like as soon as the farmers market in Matthews opens up again, they want to source as many of their ingredients as possible from over there. Great idea!!   They also make great coffee (locally roasted and tasty) and tea (loose leaf).  One downside: Everything was served on paper plates and in paper cups. They explained that the place is small and they were planning to mostly cater to the take-out crowd, but I would enjoy eating there even more on a real plate when I am not creating a pile of trash with one meal. That would also go better with the idea of sourcing your ingredients locally...   Update: There are now real coffee cups! Thanks Royal Cafe for listening to what customers have to say, awesome! :)  Bottom line: I will be back.",

The flavor was incredible, the helping more than adequate I left full! Really enjoyed the freshly brewed green tea they also have custom coffees freshly ground, I will have to try an espresso next time. Yes, there will be a next time! The only advice I will add is you may want to sit and enjoy your coffee or tea with a book (I carry one with me at all times) or enjoy good conversation as you watch them make your crepe. It takes a while but certainly worrth the wait! Loved the smell of the dessert crepe being made while I read. Nice relaxing Sunday afternoon. Don't go if you are in a rush, but then Crepes are not fast food! Enjoy!",

    "text": "YUM, YUM, YUM!   This place was great!  They just opened in Matthews a couple of weeks ago..in the same section of downtown Matthews as Thai Taste and Beantown Tavern.    It's a small comfy place with a handful of tables.  I met the owners (Mother and Daughter, maybe?) and they were both so sweet and so helpful (we had never been to a Creperie before).  They were genuinely thankful to hear that the word is out and even us folks from the Waxhaw side of town are taking the drive to check it out.  The menu is a nice blend of pre-designed creations (substitutions are welcomed!) and delicious lists of items to customize your own.  They even have a great selection of Coffees, Teas, and Bottled/Canned drinks (soda, sparkling waters, juice, etc).  All of their coffees are roasted in the Charlotte area and the Loose Leaf Teas are also local (and there's a GREAT selection, too!).   My husband had a Sugar Free Hazelnut Latte, my son had a Cafe Mocha, and I had a Cafe Au Lait.   All were smooth and delicious.  It took us a few minutes to decide on our breakfast crepes because there are so many great choices.  I opted for this week's special crepe, the \"3 Omegas\".  It was fantastic!  The flavors were great and everything was so fresh!  The 3 Omegas had  Spinach, Avocado, Feta, Black Olives, Walnuts, Black Beans, Basil Pesto, and Red Onion.  My husband had the \"Ranchero\".  It has eggs, salsa, black bans, red onions, and Jack Cheese.  My son opted for a sweet crepe...the \"Smores\"...it has Marshmallows, chocolate chips, and graham cracker crumbs and he added Coconut to it.  As to be expected with a growing teenager, that wasn't quite enough so after he inhaled the Smores Crepe, he ordered a Ranchero with Chicken instead of Black Beans.  The Crepes are large enough to share (unless you're a growing teenager, like my son) and the prices are reasonable.  We will definitely go back!   As a matter of fact, I told my husband that it's a good thing it's a 25 minute from our house or I would be there more often than I should be!  :-)",

I got here at 4:15 pm without realizing that they are closed from 3-5pm on weekdays. I decided to wait 45 mins in the car even though I was starving because I was really craving a crepe.  I got the chicken cordon bleu crepe. The crepe part was not crispy or hot. It was lukewarm and super doughy/soggy. They put such little cheese in it I couldn't even tell there was any in there (maybe they forgot the cheese?). The bacon was one of those precooked strips but it seemed like it wasn't microwaved because it was cold. They didn't even crumble it but just put one whole strip in there. 90% of what was in there was a bunch of iceberg lettuce that didn't seem fresh. Almost no chicken and that too wasn't warm. They were sub par and honestly I threw most of it away. Maybe they just had an off day because all of the other reviews are flawless. Unfortunately, my experience was unimpressive.",

Whether breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert you will not be disappointed. Very friendly staff and sociable.  They will take your order including the dessert crepe but hold off on making it until you are finishing up your meal. It saves from having to get back in line to order it or from getting funky sitting there waiting to be eaten.  They also have their own coffees they make and long list of specialty teas. They are fabulous!  Love this place!",

Very good selection of both savory and sweet crepes (they'll even bring it to the Temple for you). If you don't see a combo that interests you, the basic crepe starts at $4.50 and you can add ingredients a la carte. I kept it simple with strawberry, whipped cream and powdered sugar ( I have Nutella burnout unfortunately). The strawberries could have been a lot riper but at least someone sliced them and had them sitting in simple syrup. Texture and flavor were both about right. Hot Bergamot tea - perfect temp and strength. Really nice to have a place like this around for something out of the ordinary. Can't wait to try a savory crepe.",

The understated paper plates might make you second guess this cafe, but once you take a bite you'll realize that they know how to make their crepes the real stars of the show. I recommend ordering both a savory and sweet crepe, and then sharing it with someone so that you can indulge in the best of both worlds!",

They had a variety of coffees, and teas. Owner said she's really into healthy natural stuff, which is always great to hear. The vibes of the place felt really homey, like a family feel which was really nice. The owner suggested us to order the Bavarian crepe, she told us it was their most famous & its also prettiest haha! They also use paper plates here, and metal utensils. The cream was very light, it didn't really have much of a taste, the crepe was good. (It wasn't the best I've had, it was just okay.) Overall I really like the feels, and the lovely people here so I would come back to try their lattes/tea but I don't think I would go out of my way for the crepes! But they were also showcase in the newspaper & TV, how awesome is that?? (:",

Our crepe maker walked us through the menu, told us what was good and then made us an amazing dinner. I had the gyro crepe and my husband had the Philly. Both of them exceeded our expectations.  The owner was also there, and was extremely friendly. Two boys came in doing a psych experiment to see if they could get free food if they asked for it. She said yes instantly, which was both nice and entertaining.  We will be back very soon!",

The tea was also a surprise. Very earthy tasting, delicious!   The owner was very polite but one little thing bothered me. She walked past my table several times without offering my EMPTY cup a refill. I gave her 3 chances and even shook my cup of ice slightly for a little hint. But nothing registered in her brain that i needed a refill. I still had half a crepe to go so I needed some liquid. She seemed clueless as to my refill needs so I finally spoke up. For that reason alone, I doubt I will return.",

I wish they were closer to where I lived, but i pay them a visit as often as I'm in the Matthews area.  My first time going here, they had a pizza crepe that I would order gluten free. It was so good, but unfortunately they no longer offer it. I now build a crepe with barbecue sauce, black beans, tomatoes, bacon and chicken, which I absolutely love. And I always get the apple pie dessert crepe (I think that's what it's called). Without nuts and whipped cream and I absolutely love that as well. By far one of my favorite restaurants of all time :)",

Some of the additions will cost you $.25 and up, but I usually don't need anything else with mine.  I always go for the Smokey Chipotle Chicken and the Carmel Apple Pie (it smells like heaven).

    "text": "Whenever my already-lacking sanity gives way to pregnancy-level craving, only one place is the quintessential fix: Royal. Imaginatively, their huge crepes wrap your little body in perfectly light, perfectly warm holiness... whichever fresh toppings you fancy smothering every nook and cranny in righteous all-that's-well-in-the-world.  The variety and execution of Royal's crepe offerings are excellent, and with management who knows not what grouchiness is, you'll never leave unsatisfied nor without having a grand time. Prices are more than reasonable, atmosphere chipper. And as much as I'd like to thank Black Chicken or Carolina for pre-gaming cheerfulness prior to setting foot in Royal, their respective wines and beers can't hold a candle to the all-knowing, all-powerful crepe king that is Royal C&C.  Rating specifics (i.e. 1-5, low-high)... - Overall recommendation = 4.75 - Food taste and quality = 4.75 - Portion size = 4.25 - Price = 4 - Atmosphere = 4.5 - General service = 5 - Waitstaff = 5 - Location = 5",

The s'mores crepe is great and we also enjoy the turkey, bacon avocado, the Philly cheesesteak and the falafel. Also their coffee is fantastic as good as any dedicated coffeehouse. And the tea selection is amazing!! Well done ladies!",

My husband is a tea lover and the tea menu is ... huge! Lots of interesting an unusual options on there. If it intimidates you, ask for a recommendation. They recommended the lychee one to my husband and he loved it. One note, If you're going at lunch time on a Saturday ... expect it to be packed. It's not a huge place so it fills up quickly.",

I could have used a sauce or more butter. The crepe batter was nice and crisp. I liked the fresh spinach too. Their coffee drinks are a wide variety--I tried the pumpkin spice latte with almond milk. It was yummy and delicious. We had brunch and it was busy so I would go early.  Parking on a Sunday was packed and I chose to park by the library and walk.",

    "text": "Royal Cafe and Creperie is really as good as it gets for a fun meal. There is a wide variety of coffee and tea and the crepes are perfectly cooked with plenty of options.   Service: Our server, Elena was so kind and friendly. Right when we walked in we were greeted and given a run-down of the menu. We came on a weekday at lunchtime and it wasn't too busy. We found a seat easily and were served in an appropriate amount of time. Additionally, we told the server that we were splitting out crepe and they served us each a crepe (original order comes with two) on our own plate.  Food: Delicious. We got a dessert crepe with nutella, bananas, strawberries, chocolate syrup, powdered sugar and whipped cream on top. The crepe was soft with crispy edges and the filling was tasty and well portioned. The crepe cost $8.50 which is a bit more than I would hope, but the portion size is very large (hence why we split it) and it's nice for a treat.  Drinks: My sister ordered a cubano (strong espresso and sugar) and I ordered a 16 oz Black tea with cardamom. Both were very tasty. I would recommend splitting the tea with someone though, because I easily got three mugs of tea from that 16oz mug which is a lot for me. The tea is served in a cute little brewer that you hover over your mug and dispenses the tea which is a nice touch. The tea costs $3.25 and there are at least 30 teas to choose from and the cubano was $2.  Royal Cafe is a great addition to downtown Matthews and I look forward to going back again.",

I'm glad we got a chance to try this place before it got too crowded but I'm guessing once people hear of it, it will get super busy. Also, their coffee is locally roasted in Charlotte and the teas are from Tea-Rex -- my favorite!!",

I would be really happy if they had wine or cocktails for a nice after-dinner dessert spot. Maybe we can get them partnered up with the Black Chicken...hmmm?   Will definitely be back soon - hopefully for the nutella & strawberry!",

Crepes were perfectly cooked with just the right amount of fillings.  They are also big enough to split, especially if you want to have a savory and sweet one. Their teas are very good too.  Went back a second time and still has good has the first time. A+ for consistency.   I want to add the customer service is excellent which is always appreciated if not expected.",

Anyways, I tried the chipotle chicken. It had good chipotle flavor but I'm not a fan of lettuce being added and heated up. It goes limp. Plus, I wasn't sure the best way to eat it, just pick it up or use a fork. Now, the dessert crepe was awesome. I tried the banana, peanut butter & Nutella crepe. Fantastic! Overall it was a good experience. Pricey for sure. 4 crepes and two waters with tip came out to $42 and that's on a paper plate with plastic forks and knives. I'll be back for more dessert.",

The ladies here are very helpful since there are so many choices, including selection of your own ingredients.  Be patient....there are two crepe plates cooking and each can take 8-10 minutes.

    "text": "After keeping this place booked mark for a couple of months.  I finally decided to stop in for something sweet for breakfast.  I've had a crepe before years ago at ihop and one come style in San Francisco.  I'm not a crepe person as prefer (and more use to) pancakes and French toast.  The reviews and ratings were quite high so I decided to give it a go.  I wasn't planning to eat in but there were only 3 people dining on a rainy afternoon so I decided to enjoy my time.  As I walked in the owner came in after me after speaking with patrons outside.  She greeted me and asked if it was my first time on the way to the register.  I checked out the menu with her although I had looked at the help menu beforehand.  The owner suggested an immediate review for a lunch item a patron just finished.  He seemed honest but maybe not fulfilled.  I decided to stick with a dessert cake but asked about the specials.  The owner was trying to ring up my first thought or locate it in the computer.  I decided to try the banana foster since it was featured on the board and I've never had banana foster anything.  Then she suggested a coffee.  There's a big selection of coffee ranging from $1.85-3.85 for smalls and med/lrg.  I didn't want a suggested breve for $3 so I went with a $2 salted caramel coffee.  A little pushy although suggestive but I reminded her I was on a budget.  My total came out to $13!...the coffee was prepared with state of the art coffee machine but was very bland.  I went to the counter and the manager was concerned.  She added some syrup and wanted me to try it again then walked away.  I asked the waitress to add some more and more.  Then a sweet European woman brought my crepe to the table.  The portion was big and presentation was pretty with ice cream on the side.  The inn part was more moist and the rest kind of dry which left it hard to cut with a knife.  I wasn't checked on anymore during my whole sitting while I ate.  I believe everyone went to back because no one else came in for a while or chattery of patrons still sitting.  I left out and not even a good wishful day was given.  Forget coming back for even the gyro crepe.  I only feel regret for not going elsewhere to spend that $13 and tip.  I only tip if someone when your of there way to tell me more about the menu.  I could of had a complete breakfast for that much money.  I'm only completely full of gas right now from the coffee.",

The cafe only seats 24 inside and 6 outside. We waited until after 1 pm to avoid a long wait at lunch. The only issue which might be a problem is that the cooking surfaces are right in the middle of the seating area and they put out a lot of heat. We were there on a cool day and it was very warm in the restaurant. When we go there again it will be for take out and we will call ahead to place our order. Their business model is for take out.",

The vegetables are really tasty even for the dead of winter. The chicken I am still wondering if it is brought in frozen. I know the answer, but everything else is so fresh I just don't want to beleieve they use frozen Tyson chicken. At any rate the flavors we have tried in a variety of breakfast and lunch crepes are Delish!! My son got the banana and Nutella Crepe with creme and it was like a dessert. I had a Mediterranean one with ripe avocados, tomatoes, spinach, chick and a few other vegs. It was really good. It is a small rest tucked in the Mathews station across from the yucky Beantown rest that we tried on and off for years and they consistently got worse and worse... It's just a good ole bar, don't go there for any food! Bla but put this creperie on your list it won't disappoint.",

The ingredients were so fresh which is what I think made the difference.  They welcome you to modify your crepe as you want so that you will Truely be happy with your meal.  I think the best part of these crepes are that they are simple; they use a few quality ingredients.  I hate when there are so many ingredients in something that you can't even tell what you are eating. So if the crepes are wonderfully fantastic I don't think there is a word out there to describe the coffee.  I have never had a cappaccino that I didn't have to put some kind of sweetner in.  It was amazing.  The owner is so knowledgable on the coffee they serve and how to pull the perfect espresso and it definitely shows in the drinks.  They only serve local coffee within a week of its roasting (don't think it gets much fresher than that).  With very reasonable prices, friendly owners, fresh food, and amazing coffee I hope to see this place stick around for awhile.  The only down side for me is that it is all the way in Matthews, but is totally worth the drive!!",

I told them that I wanted a crepe with egg whites, turkey, spinach, swiss, and raspberry aioli. I thought surely that would be enough ingredients to have a hearty crepe. It wasn't.  The question is: why didn't they put enough of what I had selected in-between the folds of the crepe to make it yummy?  It COULD have been, but it just wasn't.  Add on top of that that the iced tea was probably the worst I have had all year.  Yes, I understand that they had a great selection of teas from which to choose. I simply ordered a plain iced tea.   Normally, I go through a glass of iced tea with two refills and one to go.  I didn't even make it through one glass here. Toilet water may have been better.  The best part of the meal was having lunch with my friend, Ginny. As always, we had a great time together.   This restaurant had a nice atmosphere and the lady taking the order was filled with a lot of character.   Doesn't matter how good the character is when the food didn't cut the mustard.  It didn't even come close for me, despite all the other fanfare on YELP.",

    "text": "Let me first state that in my mind, these crepes shouldn't be so expensive. I will be generous with my stars, though, as Miss Elena is with her kindness and service. The place on it's own is 4.99 stars...just a little ding for the price. Anyway.....  I do love this place. The food is so good. I had the florentine with bacon two days in a row (don't judge me). I have yet to try any of their sweet crepes or  beverages, but I am highly impressed by their offerings. I did smell the tea samples they had available and saw the fun way it is served, so I'm look forward to my next visit for that purpose/purchase.   As I mentioned above, the service here is stellar. The owner is a very kind, friendly woman and the employees are pleasant to deal with as well. On one of my recent visits, as I was leaving, I saw Miss Elana going above and beyond to take an order to a customer who was having a drink at an establishment a few doors down. Stellar, stellar service.  Go for the food, stay for the service and perhaps a friendly conversation.",

We went on a Sunday morning before the church crowd got there so didn't have to have a long wait.   Hubby got the Brave with vanilla (reccomended by elaina) and it was amazing.  Also the 8 am crepe and he loved it. Said it was filling but light and didn't leave him feeling yuck.   I got the chai latte with almond milk (love that they have alternative milk options) and it was delicious.  I also got the Gluten free omega crepe and substituted the feta for goat cheese and let me tell you it was delicious. I love that they have organic spinach, that's a plus for me.   We will definitely be returning and become regulars at this precious local crepe spot! Highly recommended!!",

When I walked in I was impressed, it sorta set up like a marble slab or similarly such, it has the work station front and center so that everyone can watch the crepe be made and all the additives around the center circular griddle. Anyhow I placed my order with who I figured was the owner, dressed in all black, with an Eastern European accent. She was friendly enough, anyhow I placed my order got my ticket and sat. It came out quickly. When I got the crepe it was very thick full of bananas and Nutella. Every night had banana in it, which is a major plus. It was also rather large for the price, and best of all it was perfect for a quick dessert. A place defiantly worth visiting. I was actually visiting charlotte but was referred there by an Uber driver....",

Or if you don't like what they've put together you can 'make' your own from a list of ingredients. Their coffee is local, oh so good.and totally refillable. They have a variety of loose leaf teas and serve them in those bottom pouring tea pots. The inside is very pleasant nicely done but not over done and the service is just excellent. Yes they serve the crepes on paper plates (sturdy ones) which is a little odd but they do have metal flatware so it's just not that big a deal. Go get your crepe on, seriously they're awesome.",

My husband and I split the S'more dessert crepe, chocolate chunks, broken graham crackers, lots of mini marshmallows, topped with powered sugar and drizzled with chocolate.  Warm, gooey and  yummy!

You wouldn't look at the order of 1 crepe, no sides as being a big enough meal but the crepe has so much meat and so many fresh veggies cooked to order that I finished a quarter of it. My son had the Nutella crepes which were very good. He makes these at home all the time so he is somewhat of an aficionado. The Peanut Butter and Banana sounded lovely but, alas, too much sugar.  The owners are very chatty and open about the business. I always ask new businesses how its going; we don't want to get attached to a new place if they'll get shuttered in a month.  This can be a bakery-level treat or a healthy breakfast so mixed groups are best. Especially wonderful for the no carbers as the crepe is about a micron think. It is a tiny spot so go off-times. We were there at 10 and had one other group. It cost around $8 each for the heavy duty meat, veggie and cheese HUGE, fresh crepe. A good deal, indeed.",

As we parked in a spot in front of the strip mall type place that leads to a circle at the library.  I could smell it; the crepes. Line can be long just like old times. Well worth the wait. As I stand in line I am viewing all of the tea options and some coffee ones. Not to long into waiting our party of 3 were given menus. This really keeps the line moving to know your order. We ordered a Florentine and a Philly cheese steak. A lavender vanilla latte and and iced mocha.   Iced mocha was more of a frozen coffee and Florentine could use some sauce or another cheese. This was our chance in taking when ordering. Its made to order, staff is very friendly and everything is very good! I definitely recommend this place especially if you have never had. I can't wait for the next chance to be back!!",

When we arrived we were met by Elaina, who I assume runs/owns it. She was really nice.  They have a huge selection of tea and coffee. I initially picked the cardamom tea but later was told it's not available so I had the masala chai instead. It was pretty good, it had cloves and cardamom. Hubby had the mocha latte that was good and not too sweet. I had the gyro crepe. It didn't have as much meat as I would have liked but because of that I was able to finish it. It tasted great though!  Hubby had the Greek isles which again didn't have much egg but was delicious!  I heard Elaina mention that they opened a new location in Charlotte that has more menu options.  I will definitely be a regular here because of all the tea/coffee options and the yummy crepes.",

Reminds me of sitting in one of my favorite cafes in Valparaiso. The service is superb, the woman who owns the shop is so kind and personable to her customers, and greets them all as a friend. The food is delicious, and the wall has a huge menu of teas and coffee. If you fall in love with the tea on a hot afternoon, you can rejoice in the fact that they sell loose leaf to take home.

I plainly asked for a double-cupped paper cup, and yes, I said please, and I got a clear glass mug.  I am convinced the owner is a little out of touch with reality. If you go into Brakeman's Coffee around the corner, it's packed. What a contrast! If this place wants to survive: 1. Take down the silly \"50 cents for coffee\" signs on the coffee urns. Coffee is by far the least expensive cost for a coffee shop. 2. Offer more things like pastry, cookies, snacks, fresh fruit cups, biscotti, et cetera. The people cannot live on crepes alone! We demand variety.  I have been here for 45 minutes now - one lady sitting outside, me inside, and a lady just walked in with her kid. Boring! I wonder if I try to sneak a refill - will I get yelled at in a foreign language? Must be why the mugs are clear glass - you're being watched!",

The Greek was a little dry but tasty.  The gyro was a super winner and will be the one I get next time we visit.    The whole time we were there,  the place had a consistent stream of people,  including the kiddos. The dessert crepes were definitely winners with them.  One of the cool things here is that you can watch them create crepe masterpieces.   Friendly staff and delicious food.

They already have outdoor seating so why not just make it a daily block party!  Now for all of the AMAZING things about this place...first, the Elaina (praying I spelled her name correctly) is so wonderful. She just carries on conversations like no one is in there but you. And when I was next in line, I wondered why she was small-talking the person in front of me for so long, but when it was my turn...we just talked and talked and I didn't mind, Ha! Seriously, she really is a wonderful individual. She made recommendations and praised her daughter to the point I asked who she was so I could meet her.   The crepes are nothing short of amazing as well. My Love ordered the florentine crepe and added chicken, and I built my own crepe with steak, egg whites, spinach, onions, chipotle aioli and goat cheese because I've been having a love affair with goat cheese lately and I put it on EVERYTHING! The crepes were beyond delicious and fresh and just plain YUMMY! We shared a sweet crepe with strawberries, bananas and Nutella...a winning combination. And from the reviews, we had to have the coffee. I had an Irish Cream latte and he had a mocha latte.  We have found another GREAT Creperie in the Charlotte area. We shall return often!",

We had the omega 3, turkey bacon breakfast crepe, and the Mediterranean, all were delicious. They brought our dessert crepe, pumpkin spice, once we were almost done with our tasty lunch and had it split into thirds without being asking. Our coffees were served in attractive mugs and were hot and perfectly made.  We'll definitely be back!!!!",

The service was excellent! You can watch your food cooked while you wait which was a show in itself and my mouth was watering the whole time. I ordered the turkey and bacon crepe it was wonderful nice and crispy yet soft the toppings were plentiful it was so big that really surprised me.  I had a caramel latte which was delicious. My BF got the Gyro crepe also super yummy he also got a Cuban coffee which he said was done just right. Everything was so good we decided to split a berry crepe which had strawberries, blueberries, and lemon cream cheese with a strawberry sauce over it....OMG we both had total foodgasims....I wish they were open right now so we could go back...it was that good!",

My only complaints are the price and the paper plates. If you are going to charge upwards of $9 for a crepe at least add some fruit as a side. The pricing and the name of the cafe should also correspond with real plates. Paper plates might work for a food truck, but not a place described as royal.",

The ladies there were really nice too! I ordered peach tea and me and my friend thought of splitting a shortcake crepe. They asked if we were splitting it and when we said yes they were kind enough to tell us that they just wanted to know so they could make us individual crepes, she said \"crepes are art and we want you guys to enjoy it =)\" I'm sorry but I thought that was really nice, and so sincere. Most places will just give you the one crepe and let you cut it yourself. They were beyond friendly and helpful.  The order didn't take long and the crepe was delicious. The cream cheese wasn't overpowering, it wasn't super sweet, (I don't like excessively sweet desserts) and it felt so light. The place itself was small but very clean and  cozy, you just want to stay there and talk forever. (we sat there for about an hour)  Their peach tea was amazing, (if you like tea I recommend you order one of their teas). It's pretty far from where I live but I will definitely be coming back to this place to try their other crepe options.",

    "text": "Well, what a disappointment. Darn it! I love crepes, and with all the great reviews I was very excited to try. My husband ordered the Hamazing.....which was Hanotsomuch. He asked for light on lettuce. It still came with so much lettuce, he had to take some out. The bulk of the crepe, apparently, is lettuce. Without it, he was left with a slice of \"lunchmeat\" ham, a slice of cheese, and a small amount of mushrooms. I ordered the Mediterranean. I've never tasted sour and bland at the same time. The pesto tasted like straight mustard. The chicken seemed to be boiled? However it was prepared, it was NOT prepared with any seasoning. Quite simply, it was pretty awful. I had 4 bites and couldn't eat any more of it. At just under $10 a pop, a True waste of my money. Although we will not be returning for an entree crepe, I am holding out hope for the desert crepes.",

    "text": "This little restaurant is AMAZING!  The crepes are cooked to perfection - thin, slightly crispy on the edges.  The menu is well put together with savory crepes like Chicken Chipotle, Philly Cheesesteak and the Hamster (eggs, ham and cheese).  The sweet crepes also do not disappoint - strawberry cheesecake, S'mores and PB n' J.  They also have varied options for making your own sweet or savory crepes with everything from avocados and chicken to nutella and marshmellows. I had the Chicken Chipotle - delicious, perfect amount of ingredients and super tasty.  It was filling, so if you think crepes are dainty - this one was not. My kids had the Hamster, which was more of a traditional crepe.  Then the S'more for desert - yum. The coffee and tea there is the True hidden jem.  If you've had enough of cookie cutter Starbucks - try this.  The tea comes loose leafed in this genius tea carrier, perfect for one person.  The coffee is fresh ground, delicious and they know how to put the right amount of foam on a cappuccino. The owner, Lena, is a wonderful woman and her bright smile and warm nature makes the space light up.  It's a cozy neighborhood place and we look forward to coming back.",

It would have been nice to not have to add chips and a drink a la carte   - small area of outdoor seating, which was much preferred today to the overly warm temp inside   - first timer that will definitely be back",

I had the Chipotle chicken and my wife had cordon blue. I had their house blended coffee and she had hot white pear tea from their impressive tea bar.  Everything was so good we had to get the carmel apple pie crepe for desert. The staff is super friendly and helpful, the food came out fast and delicious. There are only 7 tables, so it's small, but there are a couple of tables outside. The tea was was amazingly good (I'm not a tea person, but tried my wife's and really liked it) the coffee was really good too. If I had to make a critique, we would have liked real plates rather than paper. The tea and coffee come in glass and you get real silverware, so real plates would be nice. Other than that, perfect creperie. We WILL be back.",

This place has been on my radar the past couple of months, but I've never had an excuse to go and try it (other than my supreme love of breakfast foods).  I did get to do \"breakfast for dinner\" when I was hanging out at the Beer Temple next door and needed something to munch on.  My breakfast crepe dinner made such an impression on me that I made it a point to visit again during the weekend (twice!!)  Once on Saturday, and then another time after my long 10mile run on Sunday.  Each time I got to try a crepe that had exciting, fresh ingredients and made with a lot of love and care.  The owners always gave me a warm welcome and recognized that I had been coming in frequently.  We talked about running and my favorite part is watching them work their magic on the crepe griddle.  It's almost an art, pouring the batter and whisking the trowel 360 degrees (don't think this is the proper terminology and tool names) to make a perfectly thin and light vessel for the goodness that are your fillings.  They have a number of set menu items, but the great thing is that you can customize and make your own!  Located on the new \"main drag\" near the Library/Town Hall - I hope this place definitely stays a while.  I plan on doing my part and having breakfast here as many chances as I can get!",

I would get it sans tzaziki sauce as a re-order (not very \"lean\" and didn't add much flavor IMO).  In addition to their menu of sweet and savory crepes, you can build your own with a ton of creative filling options.  In addition to the crepes, there are really great locally-roasted coffees and about thirty teas.  I had a jasmine tea iced and they brewed it fresh in this cute little pot and then poured it over ice in a small pitcher table. Delicious and refreshing on a hot summer day.  Last but not least, all our communications with staff were friendly and helpful.  Can't wait to make it here for a second visit!",

I tried the strawberries and cream crepe.  It was strawberries, fresh/real whipped cream with nutella.  Need I say more?  It was awesome!!  I just wish it had a little more filling.  I took a few bites of just crepe with very little nutella so that was a little annoying but other than that..it was awesome.  The strawberries were super fresh!!  I think it is pretty hard to botch anything that has strawberries and nutella involved so I look forward to trying one of their savory crepes.    The service was friendly, the place is rather small and the lighting is super bright...so I think it is ideal for lunch or brunch.  There is nothing really inviting or warm about the atmosphere...it actually makes you want to get out of there as quick as possible.    Looking forward to trying more---s'mores, banana butter, peanut butter and jelly, etc..",

    "text": "Love this little gem in the heart of downtown Matthews! The Hamazing crepe was expertly cooked and a savory delight! Our kids enjoyed building their own crepes with just the toppings they wanted. The owners and staff were friendly, engaging, and customer focused! We followed our meal with the Royal Trinity (who doesn't love fruit, Nutella and whipped cream) and Carmel Apple Pie (apples, Carmel cinnamon and butter) crepes! So delicious. Serious coffee and tea drinkers will both find wonderful options here. The coffee is a locally roasted blend that is rich and smooth, with no bitterness! They also offer 30 different blends of gourmet fresh brewed tea. My wife raved about the iced peach oolong tea she ordered! This was our first time at Royal Cafe & Creperie, but it definitely won't be our last!",

    "text": "The crepes here are really good, and they're really creative. My wife and I usually each choose a savory crepe and then split a sweet crepe for dessert. The crepes are always perfectly cooked. Some crepes, however, are better than others. The pumpkin crepe, for instance, was lackluster and missing some ingredients when I first tried it, but it was amazing (and complete) the second time I tried it.  The selection of teas is great, and I love the pots the teas are served in. I'm a big fan of the ginger peach tea, and I get it each time I come here.  Overall, this is a place where the service is great and the food is consistently good. A meal that's actually filling can get a bit pricey, but coming here for a light lunch or a snack is perfect.",
